  a suggestion for a pan-european journey , based on some of the comments here : * helsinki to athens trip , maybe through bratislava-vienna ( eastern eu is still cheap and off the beaten track , and you get to to sea a nice cross-section of europe ), 
  i have an id , a driver 's and passport . 
  the first two ( [ foto examples ] ( http://someseanul.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/buletin-5-pasarica-alexandru-dick.jpg ) ) i have on me at all times . 
  for uses , it 's same as the polish comment . 
  i know . 
  most of my closest friends were in german-as-1st-language clases ( even though they 're not ethnic germans at all ) . 
  siestas are a general mediteranean stereotype imo . 
  otoh , german is dominant east of the iron curtain , with the notable exception pf romania . 
  [ inside europe ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/program/inside-europe/s-3067 ) by deutsche welle, 
  native : romanian , hungarian fluent : english reasonably well : french , italian, 
  in the areas of romania where it 's used ( like my hometown ) it 's used both for hello and goodbye . 
  map was made by / u/vp734 and posted on / r/etymologymaps . 
  maybe he 'll see this conversation and provide an updated map , 
  awkward :( edited . 
  [ romanians and greeks * and irish and scottish-gaelic ] ( https://i.imgur.com/oocvsen.jpg ), 
  eastern european peoples have suffered immensely due to government oppression ( we 've had both left-wing and right-wing dictatorships . 
  we also generally agree that state institutions are highly disfunctional and incompetent . 
  but we still see them as usefull and necessary and the consensus is that they need to be improved . 
  the us style libertarianism that seems to be so widespread is quite overkill . 
  oh , you mean the movie ? 
  i thought obama 's 4th of july speech . 
  a link would be helpful . 
  due to time zone difference , among other things , i doubt many europeans heard/saw it . 
  absolutely haram !, 
  like a marxist utopia ... 
  working . 
  but i live where people vacation , so i have yhat going for me . 
  there are . 
  biggest cathegories are : * orthodox conservatives - all over romania , but stronger in the regat , especially in moldavia . 
  saint parascheva pilgrimage is the biggest event . 
  * american-inspired evangelicals - stronger in western parts of the country ( banat , west transylvania ) . 
  [ relevant map ] ( https://arnoldplaton.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/neoprotestantsen.png?w=1300 ) . 
  my hometown of oradea is big on this . 
  never heard of this . 
  true, 
  most `` black people '' born in romania are actually mixed raced ( with one native parent and one foreign african parent , usually a student in one of ceau\u0219escu 's exchange programs ) . 
  they are referred to as `` mulatrii '' ( plural of `` mulatru '' ) . 
  cabral falls in this cathegory as well . 
  romanian here . 
  we 're not the most civilized drivers around and bucharest traffic and parking is its own beast , but touching another car when parking is a big no-no . 
  shit like that in the video could lead to bloodshed imo . 
  italian drivers ... 
  crossing into italy always raises my blood pressure , 
  i live in nice and i have coleagues at work from other areas of france who complain about the drivers there . 
  me being a romanian , i feel like things are quite calm , compated to home . 
  yeah , it 's a matter of perspective . 
  an a positive note , i 've seen a few similarities : `` emergency parking '' with flashing lights does remind me of home . 
  ** romania ** you can cut off a child ( i.e. 
  stop giving him money after a certain age ) but you ca n't disinherite him . 
  actually the law takes precedence over whatever will one might write up . 
  lots of scooters here in nice , france . 
  you vote directly/indirectly ( via parliamemtary elections ) for your head of state or government ( varies according to country ) which represents you in the european council . 
  you vote directly during european elections for the meps who sit in the european parliament . 
  the head of the european comission is the head of the european party that won the most votes . 
  the comissioner is named by your national government , and in some states , they are approved by the national parliament . 
  the whole comission gets voted on by the european parliament ( they have to have a majority of meps behind them , just like the national government needs a parliamentary majority/coalition ), 
  i know it is . 
  but unlike scotland an wales , ni is a recent creation , so the outside perspective is a bit different . 
  well , we see it as a british quirck ( of which you have plenty ) , but that 's about it . 
  the only one that might be weird , is northern ireland , since it 's more of a `` leftover province '' than a nation , like scotland and wales . 
  it 's different . 
  it 's not `` the us , except in german '' . 
  you can have culture shock very easily even between first world countries ( and you will ) . 
  yes . 
  / r/paris, 
  i can tell you for sure that 75 % of passangers on the oradea ( pop . 
  200k ) public transport are already subsidized ( pensioners , etc. 
  ) , via the local budget , so jumping to 100 % would probably not be * that * difficult . 
   it began when we where just past liege ( belgium ) . 
  we just had our `` walonia-shock '' ( houses who had still the black sooth on it from the industrial revolution , very poor , holes in the roads which you had to avoid to not damage your car ! , basicaly almost a third world area in western europe o_o ) i often say liege is the first city i 've been to in western europe where i felt like in eastern europe . 
  it looks like communism passed through , and people all have a case of `` grumpy soviet face '', 
  lots of countries/peoples in europe use antiquity-inspired nicknames . 
  far-righters like to call our country `` garden of the mother of god '' . 
  we were huge francophiles in the late 19th and early 20th cenyuries . 
  unlike most countries in the region ( who do german ) , our second foreign language after english is french . 
  also , we imported a lot of words from french when we `` re-latinized '' our vocabulary , and the setup of the modern romaniam state is of french imspiration ( we have a semi-presidential , centralized system , among other things ) . 
  as a colony who declared independence and fought a war for it . 
  since it 's a a superpower today , it gets mentioned ( iirc , in the general chapter regarding that time period : the enlightenment , french revolution , napoleon , etc. 
  ) , unlike the zilion other colonies that became independent and are not mentioned . 
  also , the corsicans were the first to declare a republic with a constitutiom based on enlightenment principles , in 1755 . 
  actually , the [ corsican one was the first ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/corsican_republic ) . 
  ot just got suppressed by the french ~ ~ a couple of ~ ~ 14 years layer . 
  eastern geopolitically , central culturally , and , * maybe * , western religiously, 
  romania , de facto : if you have a backyard , you can keep chickens . 
  de jure : fuck if i know . 
  106\u00a01600\u00a01859\u00a01878 1918 1989 ----- to get a bit regional , for the szekler hungarians , 1764 is an important year . 
  behind the iron curtain ... 
  tbf , a lot of people use `` europe '' and `` europeans '' as shorthamd for `` rest of europe '' and `` other/western/rest of the europeans '' in romania , without thinking for a moment that we are ' t europeans ourselves . 
  i think people read too much into that phrase when the brits do it . 
   more special privileges i 'm quite a big fan of the german word for it : * `` extrawurst '' *, 
  the uk got o `` nothing '' deal because there was really no way to give a beter deal given the current treaties . 
  i 'm supprised by how much effort was put into acomodating cameron as it is , who put himself in a corner by promising `` the sea and the salt '' * to the voters . 
  * ) - romanian expression meaning `` everything and anything '' . 
  one of the things that irk me is the idea that reu wants britain to remain because it 's a net contributor , and we see them as some kind of walking moneybag ( which is a very shallow perspective imo ) . 
  frankly , britain leaving is a lot more damaging on the political and ideological levels than it is on a financial one . 
  my hometown is on the hungarian-romanian border , and we just use `` romania 's time '' and `` hungary 's time '' for eet and cet . 
  i did n't know until recently that there are different acronyms for `` summer time '' and `` winter time '' . 
  ( the other 2 main time-zones are called `` gmt '' or `` great britain 's time '' and `` moscow 's time '' , in romanian ), 
   when applying for jobs in the eu you have to , [ ... ] prove that you can do the job better than any schengen citizen . 
  add non-schengen eu citizens as well , since we have full right to work ( well , except croatia ) .
