  my last job was project manager , i worked in construction ( tram line ) for my hometown 's public transport service ( in romania ) . 
  i now work as a draughtsman for a fiber optics company , incidentally , on a tram line project ( in france ) . 
  it is going well . 
  i used to have stomach aches and anxiety problems , now i love going to work , and actually feel productive and appreciated , even though i 'm new and my french is choppy . 
  just passed the `` 1 month '' mark on my new job ( and first since moving to france ) , and i love it . 
  feels good to work again after half a year , but the calmness of everybody is a bit unusual . 
  i might have some mild ptsd from my previous job . 
  on the downside , i am too tired after work for my hobby projects . 
  me and my so can finally start saving , and we 're thinking about having a kid . 
  in the near future . 
  also , my brother will come visit in less then a month , and ca n't wait . 
  also hope my sister comes in august as well . 
  also , i remember analists saying luxemburg will also benefit from the relocation of parts of that finantial sector . 
  whichairline ( s ) is also good wizzair might have flights from paris beauvais to budapest, 
  ( i live in nice , france ) alarm rings at 6:10 . 
  snooze 10 minutes while cat meows annoyingly . 
  get up , take a shower . 
  meanwhile my wife makes us coffee , tea ( for me to take to work ) , and breakfast ( half piadina these days ) . 
  i leave at 7:15 -7:30 , take the car , and arrive at work at 8:00 -8:25 , depending on traffic . 
  my wife takes the public transport ( bus or tram ) because she works in the city , while i work 30 km outside . 
  work . 
  this is mainly cad draughting , but can also be on site visits or meetings . 
  12:30 -13:30 ish = lunch break . 
  chitchat with coworkers . 
  coffee . 
  13:00 to 17:00 -17:30 = work , part 2 . 
  arrive home at 18:30 . 
  i either eat a meal if very hungry ( i usually i have a sandwitch at me for my drive home ) , or wait for my wife to come home . 
  when she arrives , we have our evening meal together . 
  often with a glass of wine . 
  we talk about our day . 
  we prepare ( i.e. 
  put in containers ) our meals for the next day ( main course , some sweet biscuits , maybe the sandwich too ) . 
  go to bed at around 22:30 . 
  sleep . 
  as to your other questions : yes , city is safe . 
  i 've seen plenty of kids in parks and sports areas . 
  i 'll detail the food part tomorrow if you want . 
  france : http://www.indeed.fr/, 
  i 'm romanian . 
  i notice how other countries ' internet sucks compared to ours . 
  romanian here . 
  we get excited when western bigshot leaders come to speak , and we 're pretty pro-american geopolitically . 
  glad you liked it , but ... '' [ interesting ] ( https://www.pmg.com/content/uploads/2012/03/leonardo-dicaprio-inception-movie-meme-face.jpg ) '' how ? 
  sure thing . 
  there was one high-profile negative episode you should be aware of : the death of [ teo peter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teo_peter#death ) . 
  as a romanian , [ i 'm all for it ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin_americanii ! ) . 
  personally , i 'd love for a federal eu to take over defense of the eastern flank of the eu , but that 's not happening any time soon , so `` yay america ! '', 
  it is then . 
  by foot or by public transport in the city ( nice , fr ) and some of the surrounding settlements . 
  by car to and from work . 
  i could go by public transport , but it 's a bit complicated , since i work 30 km outside the city , and would probably take double the time , than what it takes by car . 
  if you plan on living for a long time abroad , you will probably experience all the stages of culture shock . 
  you 'll be amazed by all the new things , as there is a shitload of awesome things to discover in , like all the funky cheeses and all the wines and and much more . 
  but you will also experience fatigue after a while , and frustration , and maybe even anxiety . 
  i have traveled my fair share , and still it did n't shield me from all of the above . 
  you move to a new place , and suddenly , everything is frustrating , because the things you learned may or may not apply , and you never know what . 
  one of the weirdest things i realized was that even gestures can be highly country-specific sometimes . 
  but hang in there , because it will subside . 
  and one thing that helped me a lot was a piece of advice from a friend : `` do n't take shit personally ! '', 
  ( because things might feel sometimes like everybody is maybe against you , but they are not , you 're just still adapting ) . 
  now my post might seem negative , but truth is that france is fuckin ' amazing , and i love it immensely here , even if i 'm still new . 
  the food is amazing ( y compris the wine ) , the places are amazing to visit ( and do visit ) and there is a huge variety of people , so do yourself a huge favor and do n't expat-bubble yourself . 
  actually , homo sapiens is an invasive african species ... 
  you might have a skewed image of ac prevalence in romania . 
  same in romania . 
  draft = death . 
  my father-in-law always leavea the livingroom when he turn the ac on . 
  man , italian dubbed japanese cartoons make me super nosyalgic about childhood . 
  also gave me some decent knowledge of italian , 
  the efforts in my country are largely towards * de * forestation . 
  sadly ... 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dw4x4/a_no_voter_on_the_dutch_referendums_opinion/d1uyljo ) . 
  i think rutte should make some cosmetic change to the agreement and then pass it . 
  you teach kids learning english why `` there '' , `` their '' and `` they 're '' ( for example ) are different , and make sure they understand . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://static.evzmonden.ro/uploads/2015/11/cabral_ibacka.jpg ) ( famous media personality ) probably identifies as ethnically romanian in the census , and i agree that he is . 
  he 's half-romanian , half-congolese , and grew up with his romanian grandparents and is as culturally romanian as anybody . 
  but yeah , i talked to a mixed-raced romanian who was incredibly tired of being asked `` where she was from '' ( her father was centrafrican ) . 
  i do n't know about screws ( i think they 're metric ) , but we ( romania ) still use inches for 2 things : * plumbing pipe diameters ( we use the german word for inch '' \u021bol '' ) * monitor diameters ( we use the english word `` inci '' / `` inch '' ), 
  yes , they do , and our minorities would protest strongly if the government tried to take the question out of the census . 
  it would be seen as a step in trying to push the narrative that there are no minorities , and everybody in romania is ethnically romanian ( which reminds people of the far-right a bit too much ) . 
  i understand where france is coming from , especially in light of ww2 and its strong `` everyone is a french citizen , and the rest does n't matter '' type civic nationalism , but many countries in eastern europe have totally different histories and forms of nationalism . 
  hungarians in romania put their ethnic identity above their citizenship . 
  also , it may be useful to know how your citizens identify as , religiously and ethnically . 
  some of these spelling mistakes tend to pop up in native speakers more often than not . 
  when you 're learning english as a second languages , mistakes like these tends to be preemptively corrected by teachers . 
  good idea , but we 'll probably half-ass it along as we have until now . 
  but to humour you : personally , i 'm in favor of a clean `` federalisation or exit '' referendum , and whoever stays , stays , and that 's it . 
  those who leave can have efta or whatever . 
  the language policy would remain a national responsibility , as today . 
  there could be some pan-european things in the school curriculum ( like `` european history '' once a week ) , but all the rest would be national responsibility as well . 
  i 'd also give legislative power to the parliament , and create a 10 % pan-european constituency . 
  i 'd keep the current name , because it 's nice , a solid brand at this point , and use would be a usa-ripoff . 
  ... * sigh * no , i did not see your wallet . 
  you sound like 98 % of romanian dorm students ... 
   zus north of the train station yeah , that 's the one i used to live next to , on the western end of rue trachel . 
  now i live south of the other one ( close to the palais des expositions ) , but do n't really have business inside the zus except if i have to pick up something from my post office , which , as i found out when writing my other comment , is inside the zus . 
  my first month living in nice , france i lived right at the limit of a `` sensitive urban area '' ( basically just an area of town with low employment , high-immigrant population that american media turned into `` no go-zones '' ) , one which was quite centrally located actually . 
  it 's a bit sketchy ( higher than average unemployed arabs and blacks just hanging around ) , but not really something to write home about , and not really dangerous in any way . 
  it does n't look different from the other streets in the area , and the romanians we stayed with ( who 've lived there for quite a number of years said it 's perfectly ok ) .
