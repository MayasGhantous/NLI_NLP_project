   wikipedia provides this map of the current distribution of german . 
  i do n't speak german , but i can give you some info on the group of german-speakers in the lowest right-side of the map ( the green areas around hermanstadt - sch\u00e4\u00dfburg - kronstadt ) . 
  the germans there are called transylvania saxons , and unfortunately , few of them remain today ( most live in germany today , but you can still find some in the old villages they inhabited , and being mostly old people , they still speak german - although i 'm not entirely sure if standard or dialect ) . 
  they came in the 13th-14th centuries from what is today western germany , and therefore their local dialect is closest to the moeselle frankonian dialects/luxemburgish language ( 17 and 18 on your map ) . 
  here are some videos in the dialect : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jukmxazh5ji * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgq-kn-joj4 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_hgaov1d0i also , a final video with the president of romania , he himself a transylvania saxon , although in this video i think he speaks standard german with a local accent : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smonjdry_ge maybe some german speakers could comment on these videos regarding mutual ineligibility . 
  people know up to grand-parents or great-grandparents ( i know about great-great-grandparents on one side because they were of an odd case , but that is an exception ) , but it varies from family to family . 
  record-keeping was very shitty in pre-modern romania , both in the regat and in transylvania ( where the bureaucracy was more developed , both on state level and within the catholic and protestant churches ) , since things like baptisms and marriages were recorded by the church , and the orthodox church was n't very bureaucratic , to put it lightly . 
  maybe the upper classes had better records ( especially in transylvania ) , but since they were forced into exile or perished in the `` gulag '' , they matter little today . 
  it also does n't help that we switched from cyrillic to latin in the middle of the 19th century , so anything pre-1850-ish is unreadable by 99.99 % of romanians . 
   the universe healthcare is [ ... ] more of a `` i work hard and i 'm not paying for some guys broken leg in montana '' which is a very short-sighted way of looking at things imo , and , this kind of egoism means that society as a whole looses out . 
  why do people never think that `` i could * be * that guy from montana one day '' ? . 
  you end up with a less healthy society overall . 
   plus american do n't trust our government in controlling the healthcare system i 'll take this comment together with another one from below :  i agree it works for other countries , but their governments ( atleast from my observations ) have their shit together and we do n't . 
  it 's not entirely true . 
  let 's take my country . 
  romania has a highly disfunctional healthcare system that is nowhere near `` having its shit together '' , but the overall perception is that we need to fix the problems within the system . 
  we want the government to get better at managing the healthcare system , and most people do not want full private healthcare because they know that basically leaves poor people in a very vulnerable position . 
  saying `` saying it wo n't be perfect , therefore we should n't do it '' is basically a case of [ nirvana fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nirvana_fallacy ) . 
   question : why are europeans less paranoid about the government in comparison to americans ? 
  europe has had actual totalitarian dictators in comparison to america , that seems to me like the politics of america and europe should be switched . 
  my personal opinion is that experience gives you a better perception of what tyranny is , and what it 's not . 
  i feel people in the us have a sort of cartoonish way of looking at tyranny . 
  dictatorships do n't impose themselves in a `` the state suddenly decides to enslave everyone '' kind of way , but it 's way more subtle . 
  even if i look at the us , the gov n't was pretty tyrannical towards african-americans and japanese-americans during ww2 , all with the consent of the majority . 
  but you never experienced a dictatorship , so you might not know how it comes and what it does . 
  many in europe have experienced it , some countries had both the far-right version , and the far-left version . 
  i was born in a dictatorship . 
  the question of `` what we can do to ensure it never happens again '' is very much present in public discourse , and there is real fear of ` freedoms eroding ' . 
  but nobody really thinks ` guns for everyone ' is a solution . 
  especially since we had armed resistance against dictatorship , which was brave , but useless . 
  also , we perceive the state differently . 
  if it is democratic , we see it as an expression of the will of the people , a tool that society uses to do stuff ( help certain sections of the population , correct problems in society , etc. ) . 
  the us still sees the state as something somehow partially outside society . 
  maybe it 's because of the frontier mentality , preserved from the time people settled the wild west , where the state was weak to non-existent . 
  i do n't really know tbh . 
   how is low taxes , small government , flexible gun laws , a strong standing military , and a minimum regulated free market backward ? 
  you 're focusing on the economic side , but their backwardness really shines through when you look at their social side , and their approach to science : * climate change denial * theocratic approach to government * being anti-abortion * anti-healthcare laws * xenophobia * some aspects of their foreign policy ( like lying to invade iraq ) also :  flexible gun laws generally opposed by europeans due to less paranoid view of government . 
  we see liberal gun laws as a danger to society . 
   minimum regulated free market is many times seen as a gateway to corporate abuse , and a debate that was partially settled in the 19 ^ th century . 
  although even in europe , your mileage might vary with regards to some of these aspects depending on the country . 
  switzerland is more pro-guns , poland and romania might be more religious than usual , and so on . 
   my problem : all the institutions as well as all the european agencies have different visual identities another aspect that may or may not be relevant to your question is that the main institutions are similarly named , and all are headed by a president . 
  european council , council of the european union , council of europea , european comission ( a bit different but still `` european co. . . '' ) , and everybody is a president ( juncker , tusk , schulz ... ) . 
  shit 's confusing for the average joe . 
   i believe humor is by nature deconstructive yes , i believe this is very much true , and it extends not only to fascism , but communism as well , and oppression in general * . 
  there is a huge amount of political humor that was created during the communist dictatorships in eastern europe ( fascism being shorter , it was somewhat less productive ) . 
  [ check out this / r/europe thread from not too log ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45o5p5/czechoslovak_jokes_about_the_communist_regime ) to get a feeling of what i 'm talking about . 
  in the [ utopia and terror in the 20th century ] ( http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/utopia-and-terror-in-the-20th-century.html ) lectures , the speaker keeps referring to how totalitarian regimes breed humor , and keeps giving examples from both far-right and far-left regimes throughout the lectures . 
  it 's a really interesting series . 
  * ) - this is also a factor that contributed to the jewish peoples ' rich tradition in humor , and especially [ self-deprecating humor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_humour#humour_about_antisemitism ) . 
  my bad . 
  i 'll give you that the legend exists , but i have never heard it referenced as `` our country 's origin story '' . 
  i have never heard this stuff ... 
  because it 's a counterbalance to the franco-german nucleus . 
  because it 's a significant international actor , both economically and geopolitically . 
  because it 's more market - and service-oriented and thus vital to diversity of opinions regarding economic policy in the eu . 
  because eastern europeans love the uk ( ee are sometimes more free-market than the western continentals , also job opportunities ) . 
  because the ideological edifice on which the eu is built will suffer if the uk leaves . 
  well , that 's a surprise , 
   in 8th grade , 2 years ago wait ... how old are you ? 
   i would have expected it to be easier for history to be taught from multiple viewpoints in europe due to there being so many historically important states in such close proximity with constantly changing borders ( at least historically ) actually , it 's quite the opposite . 
  changing borders means that somebody lost and somebody won territory , and thus you 're likely to get radically different points of view . 
  and the further east you go , the more controversial things get . 
  to be fair , italian and spanish are romance languages , so of course they are easier ( also why germanic-speakers have higher levels of english ) . 
  italian and spanish are easier than english for romanians as well ( just look where our diaspora is ) . 
  my point was that there might be additional factors than just the intrinsic difficulty of english when it comes to english levels in france . 
  romania : we start our first language in 2nd grade ( now almost always english ) , then our second language ( generally french , but some people take german ) in 6th grade . 
  we also take some latin starting in 7th or 8th . 
  in highschool , the level of foreign language exposure depends on the specialisation . 
  if one is in a language-intensive class , one does a lot of language hours ( main language every day , second language twice a week , latin once a week ) . 
  if one is in maths-info , less so ( english twice a week , second language once ) . 
  i also did 2 years of french ( although most of my peers did english ) in college . 
  here are some things that i think positively influence language aquisition is : 1 . 
  hearing lots of english . 
  all movies are in english ( and we subtitle , we do n't dub ) , music is english , computers are in english ( i have never seen a windows set to romanian ) 2 . 
  the realization that romanian is pretty much useless outside romania and moldova , and that in order to expand one 's horizons , one needs at least english , and preferably another foreign language 3 . 
  europe is smaller , and you do n't have to drive a long way to be in a place where people speak another language . 
  also a lot of places are multilingual from the getgo . 
  my hometown had three language communities , so you could often hear people talking any of those 3 languages ( romanian , hungarian and to a lesser extent rromany ), 
   english is very hard for frenchs imo , judging from some of the things i read in / r/france and my own background i think it 's a combination of multiple factors : * a general reluctance to speak bad english because of the fear of being mocked ( from what i understand this comes from the school environment ) * a bit of perfectionism , where one would rather not speak , than speak bad english ( leading to lack of practice ) * a general lack of exposure to spoken english because everything is dubbed most of the things the guy in video says are hard for everybody . 
  verbs tenses annoy everybody , not just the french . 
  and do n't even get me started with all the exceptions , and exceptions to exceptions with the past participle . 
  i do n't really buy it that english is somehow harder for french people per se , but i think there might be some secondary factors that negatively affect the levels of english . 
  well , bernie just made the news in romania for some less than flattering [ things he said ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/us-presidential-candidate-bernie-sanders-bucharest-residents-have-access-to-much-faster-internet-than-most-of-the-us/166176/ ) . 
  not on the same scale as the things that make the news in the us , or greece or wherever . 
  it 's usually when people set fire to the dry vegetation on the fields ( grass and straw ) , and it gets out of control . 
  or the wine and cheese aisle . 
  ( vive la france ! ), 
  in romania , non-stop stores are quite common in cities ( not sure about under-10k though ) , as well as non-stop pharmacies . 
  all-night public transport is non-existent except for bucharest ( afaik ) . 
  i might be wrong . 
  on the flipside , taxis are affordable . 
  ceau\u0219escu 's brand of communism was also very nationalistic btw . 
  you can not anti-corruption when you have no corruption . 
  checkmate denmark !, 
  internet and anti-corruption . 
  now besides the obvious turkish kebab that is popular everywhere , there are some from my hometown that are a bit more regional : * [ oradea style gyros ] ( http://oltelean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mcneil-oradea-gyros.jpg ) - this is not the greek gyros , but something that probably started there , but has since morphed into something a bit different . 
  it 's a long bread that contains : chicken meat , french fries , minced white cabbage , onions , ketchup and a mayonnaise/yogurt mix . 
  the potato one can be eaten plain , or with grated salty [ telemea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telemea ) cheese and sour cream * [ lango\u0219 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/langos_in_berlin_1.jpg ) - relevant [ wikiarticle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a1ngos ),
