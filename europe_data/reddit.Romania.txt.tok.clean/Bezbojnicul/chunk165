  in romania too , fire safety regulation dictates they open outwards . 
  i doubt it . 
  obama was softer than w. 
  putin thinks that trump is a joke , and america 's interests in europe are not gon na change radically just because trump is in charge . 
  there is no `` putin-trump alliance '' and i doubt there ever will be . 
  maybe better suited for / r/askuk or / r/ukpolitics, 
  we think it would be a great idea ... 
  one [ interesting aspect ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/romanias-richest-witches-876 ) , but far from the only one . 
  bucharest = little paris a neighborhood in my hometown of oradea is named after venice . 
  do n't really remember seing any . 
  there might be in bucharest . 
  the legal aspect : selling alcohol to those under 18 is ilegal , * but * nobody really respects the law . 
  the family aspect : familiarisation with alcohol begins in the early teens , when kids usually ask to `` drink the foam off the beer '' , then a bit later they are allowed a small glass of beer or wine under adult supervision , and so on and so on . 
  the `` without adult supervision '' part : is basically drinking one-two levels above what you would drink with the parents/family . 
  as long as you do n't look too young ( in which case you might be refused service ) , you 're ok . as someone said , it 's called `` highschool years '' . 
  \u0218eng\u0103n :p, 
   if you 've never been outside of oregon your whole life then go to brownsville it can feel like a different country true , but you phrased it as if it was universally true . 
  which it is n't . 
  it 's a viewpoint born out of ignorance ( which is what people here were arguing ) . 
   and yes going from texas to oregon can feel like you 're in a different country i feel we 're talking a bit past each other . 
  let me try one last time : 1 . 
  this subreddit , and especially this thread is full of people who have traveled to different countries and know how being in a different country * feels * 2 . 
  you 're a person who has never left his country * but * you say that `` going from texas to oregon can feel like you 're in a different country '' the people in group 1 think that your assessment of what it * feels * to be in a different country might not be entirely accurate , since they know * from experience * how that feels and you do n't . 
  do you see my line of reasoning ? 
  nobody is arguing that the us is * not * diverse . 
  people are arguing that it is not * whole - ` nother country * - level diverse . 
   but i never said it was as huge between two european countries !, 
  let me quote you :  * going from texas to oregon is culturally a whole different country * do you honestly not see how that can be interpreted as saying that the difference between texas and oregon is as big culturally as between 2 european countries ? 
  -- --  you ca n't tell me portugal has the same amount of diversity as the usa and that 's literally all i 'm saying . 
  no , but you might want to look at other countries such as : * the uk - made up of 4 constituent countries , some with their own language * spain - with 4 major languages inside it * france - compare brittany to bordeaux to alsace to corsica and to french guyana * russia - with all its constituent republics . 
  i 'm pretty sure the difference between dagestan , st. petersburg , tuva are pretty significant * belgium and switzeland - linguistically and politically * even fuckin ' romania - the difference between br\u0103ila and odorheiu-secuiesc are bigger in terms of language and religion than you might think . 
  if i had a dollar for every time i heard people mumbling about how szeklerland `` feels like a different goddamn country \\* rumble rumble \\* '' my point is that i think you 're making some assumptions that might not be entirely accurate . 
  i think you should consider going on a small vacation to quebec . 
  it looks like the closest thing to a true `` foreign country '' to where you live , reasonably close . 
  i can assure you it will be eye opening . 
   all my point was the usa has vastly different cultures in different parts of the country and going from minnesota to miami can feel like you 're in a different country and they 're like `` bad bad dumb american '' hahah is that all your takaway from people 's comments ? 
  `` bad bad dumb american '' ? 
  really ? 
  people have explained why you are looking at it in a wrong way , and you keep insisting that if one state is conservative and another one is liberal , it 's like another country . 
  now let me give you what it feels to move from one country to another , what are some things that will change when you actually change countries : * language : wan na feel like you 're a teenager again ? 
  move to a country where you do n't master the language to a proficient level , and suddenly you 're reduced to speaking basic phrases . 
  even if you 're fluent , you might not grasp all the proverbs , phrases and so on that are contained in a language . 
  * body language : yep . 
  this changes from one country to another . 
  the french have different body language and facial gestures than the italians , and both have it different from romanians . 
  these start to become very obvious when you switch countries . 
  * cultural references : people who grew up in certain place consume local media . 
  they share memories of common tv shows and so on . 
  of different products in stores appearing at different times . 
  all these are important when people interact and talk about their shared experience . 
  * politics . 
  not just the overall level of conservativism but the parties themselves . 
  the issues are defined in entirely different ways as one goes from one country to another . 
  what is up for debate in one country might not even be an issue in the next . 
  political concepts in one country might not be relevant in another . 
  within the us your politics is different shades of the same democrat-vs . - republican debate . 
  you refer to the same constitution , you refer to the same historic figures , and the same political precedents , even if live in different states . 
  * the state . 
  state institutions change dramatically . 
  when you actually change countries , you actually have to re-learn how bureaucracy works . 
  like from the ground up . 
  people may complain about bureaucracy in france , but it 's a very different beast from the nightmare of romanian bureaucracy . 
  i am a romanian who has family in different parts of romania , and while there are noticeable cultural and even linguistic differences within romania , moving to a different country ( which i did 5 months ago ) is a whole new level of different . 
  a lot of shit you take for granted just fuckin ' flies out the window , and if you have n't been outside your country it 's difficult to explain how strong that difference is . 
  just because some parts of the us think obama is a crypto-muslim and some do n't , does n't mean that you have cultural differences as big as 2 different countries . 
   i 'm not sure why you 're being downvoted ; because of this :  going from texas to oregon is culturally a whole different country it implies that the cultural difference between texas and oregon is as huge as between 2 countries ( implicitly , 2 european countries ) . 
  which is ridiculous . 
  timi is further from the border . 
  since i 'm on the phone now , in bed , i 'll write a more extensive post tomorrow morning to explain why that is small potatoes compared to intra-european cultural difference . 
  edit : where do you live ? 
  i never understood this dichotomy . 
  a country can both `` cosy up to the us '' and be very pro-eu . 
  just look at eastern europe . 
  i used to live in a city 10 km from the romanian-hungarian border . 
  i now live 30 km from the french-italian one . 
  hopping over to the nearest town on the other side for shopping is very common for a lot of people . 
  my hometown is closer to 4 other european capitals than to my own country 's capital ... , 
  thay 's quite a small cultural difference tbh . 
   what about baseball ? 
  we have a thing called [ oin\u0103 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oin%c4%83 ) that some people have tried to popularize during the last century , but it really has n't caught on that much . 
  i think it 's the closest thing to baseball we have . 
  speak the language to a certain level . 
  understand the cultural references to a certain level . 
  bitch about the [ bureaucrats ] ( http://jurnalul.ro/thumbs/big/2012/12/17/biroul-paispe-renumitul-birou-paispe-de-la-administratia-financiara-a-sectorului-6-18438249.jpg ) and the bureaucracy to a certain level ...  can a first generation immigrant truly integrate in your eyes ? 
  we 're a country that brought down a government [ because of a first-generation immigrant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_romanian_protests#objection_by_raed_arafat ) . 
  so yeah , i think you can , 
  it 's viewed as anything from unacceptable to an acceptable last resort when all else fails , and by some an integral part of child-raising . 
  but according to [ a 2012 study ] ( http://www.ziare.com/social/romani/cati-romani-cred-ca-este-perfect-justificat-sa-iti-bati-copilul-sondaj-irss-1204574 ) , the answers to the question \u201e is light corporal punishment ( pulling the era , occasional spank ) justified ? '' * 60 % never justified * 36 % sometimes justified * 2 % always justified,

  yeah . 
  we eat a lot of cheese daily , and we do n't buy large quantities . 
  the ones that are marked `` first time trying it out '' were bought in quite small sizes . 
  also , if they start drying up or going bad , i try to make some food that incorporates that cheese . 
  currently i have french , italian and romanian cheeses in my fridge ( for context , i live in france , near the french/italian border ) : french : * [ ** brie ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brie ) - my so loves it . 
  * [ ** tommes des pyrinees ** ] ( http://www.internationalcheese.co.uk/products/tomme-des-pyrenees-plain ) - first time trying it out .
