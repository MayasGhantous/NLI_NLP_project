  italian : * [ ** quartirolo lombardo ** ] ( http://www.cheese.com/quartirolo-lombardo/ ) - it 's the closest thing we found to the romanian [ ** telemea ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telemea ) cheese . 
  we eat it by itself ( with bread and tomatoes and maybe salami or sausage ) , in a salad , or in soup ( at the moment of eating , not cooked into the soup ) * [ ** parmigiano-reggiano ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parmigiano-reggiano ) - 2 types : the usual 12 month old and a more aged 40 month old . 
  used for pasta and the like * ** mozarella ** * [ ** asiago d'allevo ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asiago_cheese ) - for microwaved sandwiches . 
  first time trying it out . 
  * [ ** tomino di bosconero ** ] ( http://www.italian-cheese.org/en/home/1722-tomino-di-bosconero.html ) - first time trying it out . 
  romanian : * [ ** burduf cheese ** ] ( http://cheese.wikia.com/wiki/br%c3%a2nz%c4%83_de_burduf ) - for spreading on bread , or use on sandwiches , in soups ( at the moment of eating , not cooked into the soup ) we usually also have some ** [ st. felicien ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint-f%c3%a9licien_cheese ) / [ st. marcelin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint-marcellin ) ** ( fr ) in the fridge , some grated ** cheddar ** and [ ** st. albray ** ] ( http://iledefrancecheese.com/index.php/st.-albray/st-albray.html ) ( the last two because my so like them ) . 
  we also love blue moldy cheeses like [ ** gorgonzola ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorgonzola ) / [ ** bleu d'auvergne ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bleu_d%27auvergne ) . 
  yeah . 
  `` chav '' comes from the romany ( gypsy ) language . 
  there 's plenty of europeans there , the overwhelming majority . 
  the only time americans might dominate is when / r/europe gets raided from places like stormfront or / pol . 
  yeah , i 'm not disputing that . 
  we need highways like oxygen . 
  the general image of eastern european countries . 
  yes , we have roads . 
  no we do not all drive carts . 
  yes , it is safe , very safe actually . 
  yes , there is still a lot of poverty in the countryside , but the cities are on par with those in the west , more or less , and stuff is changing for the better fast ( thanks eu ! ) . 
  also , our internet is fabulously fast and cheap !, 
  and so on ... on a more national level , being confused with roma ( aka gypsies ) drives a lot of romanians up the wall ( i do n't personally care that much ) . 
  relevant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0, 
  not really . 
  we did do one big bonfire on the last night when we went camping in the 3rd grade , but that was a spontaneous thing . 
  otoh , bonfires are [ a thing in northern ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleventh_night ), 
   but i 've heard stories that some countries in europe have actually criminalized speech that has been branded as `` hate speech '' . 
  tell me this is a misconception and that you do n't actually lock people up for their thoughts . 
  the last part comes off as `` oh my , say it is n't so !!! '', 
  and makes his whole question look very judgmental . 
  you might say i am reading too much into it , but his very first comment confirms how judgmental he is :  i was just amazed to find out that advanced societies like countries in europe actually do this implying that locking someone up for holocaust denial ( for example ) is anathema to what constitutes an `` advanced society '' . 
  and i 'm not the only one who noticed the tone of his question , mind you . 
  also , i really do n't care if people over on / r/askanamerican have thicker skin or not . 
  in romania , each summer , there is the [ fool moon horror film festival ] ( https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t31.0-8/10446308_709098439156747_2397419931175014118_o.jpg ) in biertan , transylvania . 
  it 's a small festival , a bit off the beaten track , but it 's quite fun . 
  it is traditional that the last movie shown each year is rocky horror , and it 's a big thing . 
  can confirm . 
  yanks should visit romania . 
  0 % - you hated the service , and you want them to know it 5 % - the service was ok-ish , but could be improved 10 % - the service was as good as it should be . 
  you basically have nothing to complain about . 
  15 % or above - the service was awesome-possum . 
  basically , people round up to the closest thing to 10 % . 
  so if it 's 27 lei , you give 30 lei . 
  if you pay by card , ( using the example above ) you pay the 27 lei by card , and leave 3 lei tip in cash on the saucer they use to bring you the card back . 
  the tone of his question set the tone of the answers . 
  to add to / u/velsor 's point about the historical context , and to give you something of a european perspective on the issue , here are two comments from / r/changemyview : * [ a german ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3yqj7a/cmv_hate_speech_should_never_be_banned/cyg4gy0 ) * [ an austrian ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g6mhy/holocaust_denial_shouldnt_be_a_crime_cmv/cah9wer ), 
  i actually burst out laughing first time i heard it . 
  but that is actually a parody of an older song as far as i can tell . 
  such is life . 
  \u201e romanian battalions , cross the carpathians '' seems to be from wwi , \u201e union dance '' is based on a poem published in 1856 and i ca n't find anything on the others ( although there is a strong possibility they are from the ceau\u0219escu period - 1970 's -80 's ) . 
  the old anthem is also based on a 19th century poem . 
  sorry for being harsh but your tone is quite self-righteous and it 's an info that is easy to google , and wikipedia is a very good source of information ( with citations you can follow ) . 
  yes , advanced societies can and do do this . 
  are you interested in knowing why ? 
  some . 
  they all come out on the national day , and are usually about how transylvania is super-duper * ours * !,

  first of all , wikipedia can answer if it 's true : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech for example :  in germany , volksverhetzung ( `` incitement of popular hatred '' ) is a punishable offense under section 130 of the strafgesetzbuch ( germany 's criminal code ) and can lead to up to five years imprisonment . 
  section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult , maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their ( constitutionally protected ) human dignity . 
  thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups `` maggots '' or `` freeloaders '' . 
  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial#prosecutions_and_convictions now , let me ask you a question : why are you here ? 
  are you genuinely interested in why ( certain ) european countries perceive freedom of speech differently than the us , or do you just want to get a freedom-boner out of the fact that the us is `` free-er '' than europe ? 
  how 's it viewed in hungary ? 
  ** edit ** - [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1t44q1xmzg ), 
  actually , the overwhelming majority of easter european roma are n't nomads anymore . 
  not really . 
  xpost to / r/romania for details . 
  putin was trolling . 
  putin thinks trump is a moron . 
  ( source : i 'm an eastern european ) and btw putin is way way smarter than trump . 
  i 've seen most of your answers were from central or western europeans so let me give you an eastern european perspective , since the threat of ( a russian ) invasion is much more present in our mind . 
   do you all just have faith in your militaries to protect you domestically ? 
  but this is why , after communism collapsed , we ran as fast as we can towards nato and bent over backwards to get in as soon as possible . 
  and you have to realize that ( at least in romania ) , basically all male adult ( and some female ) have undergone mandatory military training , so the philosophy during communism was that in case of invasion , every man must fight ( the gov ' t would distribute weapons when needed ) . 
  but the truth is we knew that when russia decides to invade , even arming your whole population is peanuts compared to the russian army . 
  the best repellent is a deterrent , and there is no deterrent like the nuclear deterrent . 
   armies of small nations are useless by themselves . 
  just look at the asymmetry between any baltic nation and russia . 
  so no , we do n't have faith in our militaries , we have faith in our militaries + all the milirtaries of nato combined . 
   like all of the civilian resistance groups in world war ii ? 
  we had anti-communist armed resistance groups in the mountains after ww2 . 
  in the end , they were n't that efficient . 
  / r/europeans ( with an s at the end , unlike the nazi one ), 
  could you expand on why you think it 's a oositive feature . 
  just left romania last friday with my car packed to the max ( me and the wife moved to france ) . 
  on the first day we did romania -  hungary -  austria -  munich . 
  nobody asked us anything . 
  hungary was full of police but they did n't care about us even though many of the smugglers are romanian , according to recent arrests . 
  we saw 2 refugees right after entering austria and that 's it . 
  we were in munich as the big wave of refugees arrived but we saw none on the streets . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  reserve at least a week for istambul , maybe more . 
  there is a shitload of things to see . 
  relevant : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dynamo_fc_ ( disambiguation ), 
  i live in [ oradea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradea ) , romania , which is 10 km from the hungarian border , and i cross the border often ( as do lots of people here ) . 
  the usual border setup used to be - romanian border with guards/passport check - no man 's land - hungarian border with guards/passport check . 
  ever since eu accession , the setup is basically - empty border post - no man 's land - common border control . 
  so basically whichever way you 're entering , it 's always the second border post that has a common border control instead of both countries having a separate one . 
  also , i only have to show my id , and basically they look at the id , look at me , and let me pass . 
  no passports , no nothing . 
  it 's almost non-existent tbh ( for me as an eu citizen ) , but moldovan citizens get pulled over and checked like clockwork .
