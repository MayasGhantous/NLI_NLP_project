  so do trucks . 
  and they are n't sitting in booths anymore , as 99 % of people are eu citizens and do n't need to have their id scanned as they used to do with the passports . 
  btw , [ this ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/47193300.jpg ) is how the disused section looks like .

  `` uniting all romanians '' ( in the sense of coming together , not anschluss ), 
  i went on a venice-florence-pisa-monaco-barcelona-bordeaux-paris trip in the 11 ^ th grade . 
  we were supposed to go in the 10 ^ th grade but our schengen visa was denied ( although we had invites from france and all , given that it was a sort of exchange program with a school from bordeaux , and we got to sleep 2 nights each kid at a local family ) . 
  a year later visa requirements were removed for romanians , so it was n't as hard to go . 
   basically i 'm a 17 years old freshman ( mech-eng ) in a worldwide accredited university ( as far as i was told ) and moving to europe was one of my goals since 4 years ago . 
  how come ? 
  there are some monarchist voices on the right , and a lot of nostalgics , but no real threat to the republic . 
  a lot of people pay lip service to `` bringing the king back '' ( our last king is still alive ) , but put it to a referendum , and i am sure it will be crushed . 
  found [ an opinion poll ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/adevarul-despre-romania-sondaj-1_51619e2b00f5182b85934e91/index.html ) from 2013 : prefered system :  * presidential republic : 35.3 %  * ** constitutional monarchy : 17.7 % **  * parliamentary rep. : 13.2 %  * semipresidential rep. : 12.9 % * ( current system ) *  * do n't know/no answer : 20.8 %  ( total republican : 61.6 % ), 
  same in romania . 
  that movie is beautiful !, 
   as we can all see , this subreddit has gradually changed into something which could be called / r/europetravel [ 1 ] it 's summer and people travel during the summer . 
  i think it will fade come september . 
   feel that this sub could use some stricter rules about itineraries/money exchange/booking flights , which are strictly travel related i think it would be better if we had some threads/links to useful sites ( for finding hostels , for finding planes , for travel tip , etc ), 
   you should n't be able to pay in euros , but you can and there are exchange offices everywhere you go . 
  buying bread ? 
  use kuna ( croatian currency ) . 
  buying real estate ? 
  use euro . 
  it 's a leftover from high inflation in yugoslavia in 1980 's and use of deutsch mark instead of dinar back then . 
  same here . 
  mobile phone rates , real-estate , vehicles as well as some services ( wedding photo/video rates , architecture fees , so on ) are all in euros . 
   a public fountain in some village , where one would take water out using a golden cup ; the cup was not stolen until the day he died iirc , the hungarians have the same myth with matthias corvinus . 
   while \u021b should be the equivalent of turkish c. * \u021b * is [ ts ] while turkish * c * is [ d\u0361\u0292 ] , as in george . 
  ( what you said eould come out as \u201e gepe\u0219 '' in romanian ), 
  you should xpost it to / r/europeanculture, 
  [ index of the presidential debates ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25gogo/meta_index_of_eu_candidate_debates/ ) ( links to all of them ) also , check out deutche welle 's '' [ inside europe ] ( http://www.dw.de/program/inside-europe/s-3067 ) '' podcast ( not exclusively politics , but it 's really good ), 
  not in the east . 
  a sicilian girl i met recently advised me against hitchhiking in the south of italy . 
   in romania at least it is assumed ( or expected ) to pay some amount of money unless otherwise agreed upon before embarking . 
  an estimated price would be about 10 lei ( ~ 2.2 $ ) / 150 km , although i have n't hitchhiked in about 5 years , so it might have gone up a wee bit . 
  also , i often encountered people who outright refused to take my money , so it depends from one situation to the next . 
  also , the [ archangels ' church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/sfintii_arhangheli_kings_braila.jpg ) in br\u0103ila [ used to be a mosque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_the_holy_archangels_michael_and_gabriel,_br%c4%83ila ) way back when the area was a turkish raya . 
   most are around the black sea region basically , where there was direct ottoman administration . 
   the youth * of bucharest * go to the seaside fixed, 
  romania : everybody uses english ui afaik , except maybe some hungarians , who use hungarian ui . 
  i fucking hate programs translated into romanian . 
   europeans were surprised to see that most computers in greece and cyprus are actually using the english ui , regardless of operating system . 
  funny , my uncle 's windows was in greek . 
  he lives in pireas , and this was back in the mid 2000s . 
   ( western europe , not eastern ) why not ? 
  i dissagree to an extent . 
  i found venice to be enjoyable , although it 's its own thing , and there are other cities in italy that are more representative of the country as a whole . 
  the third time was early last september with my so , it was in between flights and she quite liked it . 
  we had 6 hours to visit , but i feel about 8 hours is just right to see the main things without entering buildings like the doge 's palace , st. mark 's cathedral or the campanile ( which have huge queues at the entrance ) . 
  regarding dirtyness , i did n't think it was that dirty tbh . 
  ( the only italian city that felt somewhat dirty was rome , although that 's as south as i 've been ) . 
  i agree that she should see other cities besides venice to get a better feel of italy . 
  relevent to the current discussion : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1x39b8/what_romania_can_teach_the_western_world_unlike/ might add some things that directly answer op 's question tomorrow . 
   another related thing is the ( highly normative ) idea of marriage-proposals-cum-diamond-ring . 
  i 'm pretty sure for most europeans the idea of `` popping the question '' seems utterly absurd : marriage tends to be something one discusses after living together for some time , and wedding rings tend to be rather sober . 
  romanian here , soon to be married . 
  while marriage is discussed beforehand , `` proposing '' is a thing . 
  it was pretty much a given that we were to marry , but when exactly depended on me `` popping '' the question . 
  but you 're right , nobody expects diamonds or anything expensive , as they are seen as something very out of the ordinary . 
  now i do n't really know how strict rules are regarding engagements in the us . 
  there most certainly is n't the idea of `` asking for her fathers approval '' , or anything of the sorts . 
   is n't this mandatory in other countries as well ? 
  not in romania . 
  the flag law law just states that :  * art . 
  7 - [ ... ] the flag of the european council can be displayed in places where the romanian flag is displayed . 
  * but virtually all public institutions ( which must always display the national flag ) choose to display the european flag as well . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3svee.jpg ) is in front of the town hall of oradea ( nagyv\u00e1rad ) , for example . 
   are stations and programming mostly public and non-profit or are they predominately commercially operated ? 
  predominantly commercial . 
   are stations mostly local or are they part of larger national or international networks ? 
  mostly national and international  what type of programming is popular ( e.g. 
  genres of music , sports , political talk , news , other types of talk ) ? 
  what 's their relative popularity ? 
  most popular seem to be music stations . 
   what types of modulation are most popular ( e.g. 
  am and fm here in the us ) ? 
  fm is the most popular by far . 
   how many stations do you get in your area ? 
  how many different languages are broadcasting to your area ? 
  about 15 , give or take . 
  i live in western romania , so i get radio from both romania and hungary . 
  they are : * radio rom\u00e2nia actualit\u0103\u021bi - main romanian state radio focused on news , talkshows , and music * radio rom\u00e2nia cultural - romanian state radio focused on things cultural ( classical music , cultural news , etc. ), 
  * pet\u0151fi r\u00e1di\u00f3 - hungarian state radio , focused mainly on contemporary music * bartok r\u00e1di\u00f3 - hungarian state radio , focused mainly on classical music * europa fm - ro , private , 80 's - to-today 's music * magic fm - ro , private , latest hits music * radio zu - same * kiss fm - same * national fm - same * favorit fm - ro , private , [ manele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manele ) music * neo fm - hungarian , private , latest hits music * radio transilvania - local romanian radio in the romanian language , private * p\u00e1rtium r\u00e1dio - local romanian radio in the hungarian language , private * radio trinitas - romanian language channel of the romanian orthodox church * radio maria - bilingual ro/hu catholic radio . 
  catholics here are divided between ethnic romanians that belong to the greek-catholic ( uniate ) church and ethnic hungarians that belong to the roman-catholic church . 
  * radio vocea evangheliei ( radio voice of the gospel ) - baptist-pentecostal - [ evangelical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_evangelical_church_of_romania ) radio , in the romanian language . 
  the neoprotestant churches have a strong presence in western romania . 
  oddly , they broadcast radio france international news at certain hours . 
  being close to the hungarian border means there is a strong presence of hungarian radios from across the border . 
  further south , in [ timi\u0219oara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timisoara ) , i know they have serbian radio ( not sure if local or from serbia ) and further north , at [ carei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carei ) one starts picking up zakarpattya fm from ukraine . 
  nay !, 
   ignoring the uk well , if we start with bias in our selection , then ... ignoring the baltics , the homicide rate in eastern europe is comparable to some western countries . 
  do you also advise against taking the unnecessary risk of going to the uk ? 
  also , i 'm not sure what you 're trying to prove with the \u201e incarceration rate '' . 
  i think there might be a difference to approach when it comes to incarceration between east and west . 
   i was n't telling him that he 'd die in eastern europe , but it is less safe there . 
  maybe if he goes to the baltics . 
  and even so there is a difference between \u201e somewhat less safe '' and \u201e you gon na get kidnapped '' . 
  speaking of which , i 'm still waiting for something related to those kidnappings you mentioned . 
  yes . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but gypsies are n't much of a danger in romania , unless you camp right next to the gypsy area of the village .
