  i think it 's [ rapeseed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapeseed ) . 
  i was pointing to kadyrov as an example of despotism and aggresion . 
  find me one single politician in the west that is comparable to ramzan kadyrov . 
  regarding corruption , i wish i lived in a society as corrupt as germany or france . 
  you should answer / u/jurble, 
   the west is just as corrupt , aggressive , and despotic as russia . 
  find me one single politician in the west that is comparable to ramzan kadyrov . 
   is n't that the same thing ? 
  this is one of those `` devil 's in the details '' situations , but i 'd say `` right to self-administration '' is a bit more vague . 
  ** also : ** tuesday 's ( may 13 ) [ third head-to-head - schulz vs juncker ( * in french * ) ] ( http://videos.tf1.fr/infos/2014/replay-le-debat-juncker-schulz-8418493.html ), 
  i already did, 
  does the sign say `` westmal [ beer ] or halal ? '', 
  feel free to report me if that 's what you imagine i was doing . 
  meaning what ? 
   and do they truly love each other now ? 
  no , because the eu is not about love . 
  it 's about cooperation for a better shared future . 
  like an apartment building inhabitant 's association . 
  i do n't trust all my neighbours , but that does n't mean we ca n't all work together to fix the roof or repaint the stairways , or whatever , knowing that otherwise , the whole building would go to shit . 
   holding a referendum on eu membership is not petulance it 's democracy . 
  i was n't talking about holding the referendum . 
  hold all the referendums you want . 
  leave if that 's what you want . 
  just do n't act like you have no power to influence policy in the eu . 
  you could find plenty of allies in the eu if you just tried . 
   other countries should try it . 
  oh get off your high fuckin ' horse . 
   the continent and the british isles have never been truly in love with each other . 
  neither have many of the countries that make up `` the continent '' . 
  germany and poland , germany and france , hungary and romania , hungary and slovakia , to name a few examples . 
   if the people on the continent do dislike the uk , it 's because of nothing we have done . 
  acting like a petulant child is not nothing . 
  if the uk wants cooperation , it should start cooperating . 
  it 's laughable that one of the top 3 states in the eu ( in terms of both population and economic strenght ) acts like some small helpless child all the time that is being oppressed by the eu . 
  there is more to negotiating than threatening to to leave , like some drama queen . 
  the rest of us are running out of patience tbh . 
   any good news about the uk is bombarded with inane shit like this til 1 comment is `` bombarded '', 
   there 's a blonde woman on the left do n't you mean `` right '' ? 
   when almost all hungarian women have naturally brunette hair . 
  compared to you ridiculously blonde fuckers , yeah , they are all brunette . 
  compared to us , they are blond ** er ** , and thus have their fair share of blondes . 
  well , this is interesting ... maybe i should add this to the debate list , 
  i think spaniards and frenchmen buy alcohol from andorra because it 's cheaper ( iirc ) , so that might bump up their numbers . 
  tbh i like the ep [ hemicycle in strasbourg ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/ep_strasbourg_hemicycle_l-gal.jpg ) way more than the one in [ bruxelles ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/2007_07_16_parlament_europejski_bruksela_40.jpg ) . 
  for romanians , [ it 's gon na be available on na\u015ful tv ] ( http://www.nasul.tv/2014/05/12/15-mai-ora-2200-dezbaterea-pentru-presedintia-comisiei-europene-in-direct-la-nasul-tv/ ) , which is n't exactly the most mainstream of tvs tbh . 
   the rest are basque and castillian . 
  castillian ? 
   fidesz 's ep election campaign theme is clear : `` our message to brussels : respect hungarians ! '', 
  i see hungary is also playing this card . 
  so is our biggest party . 
  '' [ we 're sending people to bruxelles who are proud to be romanian , who will defend romania ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2014-04-25-17107782-41-psd-apara-romania.jpg ) ''  while fidesz will undoubtedly win the eu elections , far-right party jobbik is also set to do very well in the 25 may vote . 
  given the results of recent parliamentary elections , i 'm not surprised at all . 
   more like the poetic idealization of the countryside it looks to me that in the west , it 's rather the hippies-lefty-eco-sustainable-organic crowd who do the poetic idealization , of nature and sustainable-small-farm living . 
  not necessarily wrong , just that the demographic is shifting . 
   what i think is interesting is that romanians are also guilty of this , for instance with respect to moldova . 
  indeed . 
  as the stereotypes go : * all transylvanians are essentially hungarian * all southerners are essentially gypsies * all bessarabians are essentially russians, 
  so , what you 're saying is that elves annoy you ? 
  not me personally , but many-many people are annoyed about the `` we are all gypsies '' stereotype . 
  only 5 % -10 % of us are , and we do n't have a monopoly on the roma minority . 
  this happens to many in eastern europe . 
  romanian and/or hungarian being included in the `` slavic studies '' department in us collegees is not that weird . 
  i think also albanian falls victim now and then . 
  i think it 's just that idea that anything east of germany is basically `` slavland '', 
  context : dude in the background is the president , chick in the foreground is elena udrea , head of the new people 's movement party , which is the president 's new pet party . 
  also , [ after the first 4-candidate euro-debate ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bmvf4ifimaa0hvx.jpg ), 
  also , there is still a bit of trouble between \u201e petersburg '' and the rest ... 
   t\u00eergu mure\u015f since the 1992 spelling reform , it 's \u201e t ** \u00e2 ** rgu mure\u015f ''  for instance the freedom street , which would be called ** libert\u0103\u0163ii ** street in romanian and ** szabads\u00e1g ** * utca * in hungarian it should be * strada * libert\u0103\u021bii , given that they translated \u201e street '' into hungarian a few letters down . 
  also , should n't romanian party initials be anglicized , same as how udmr decame dahr ? 
  well , color me impressed . 
  not only did today 's debate [ make it into the press ] ( http://www.euractiv.ro/uniunea-europeana/articles%7cdisplayarticle/articleid_26033/live-video-storify-dezbatere-candidati-la-sefia-comisiei-europene-\\ ( ora-19 .30 \\ ) - + - live-video-conferinta-starea-uniunii-2014 - ( florenta-italia \\ ) . html ) ( hotnews linked here ) , but so did [ yesterday 's german debate ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-europarlamentare_2014-17200631-duel-televizat-intre-schulz-juncker-ucraina-puii-imbaiati-clor.htm ) . 
  it seemed to me bove was quite federal , judging from the answers he gave tonight . 
  i like the moderators . 
  good questions on their part . 
  stickied and playball !, 
   thirdly , it shows that romania , poland and hungary are overrepresented . 
  the numbers might be fudged by the fact that you used a different number for romania 's population than the eu . 
  you used ~ 19 milion , but the 2011 census shows a [ population of 20,121,641 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania ) which is probably the number used by the eu . 
  awesome !, 
  much more legible . 
  thanks . 
   is it me or there isnt much news on the debates ? 
  there really is n't as much as there should be imo . 
  but i am glad it 's not ignored by [ romanian-language media ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=metrou+bucuresti&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=cbbsu-dii-z3yaoe4iggbg#channel=sb&amp;q=dezbatere+schulz&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;tbm=nws )  got anything on the april 29th one ? 
  [ this ] ( http://euobserver.com/news/123949 ) is the only one i could find . 
  all the others were earlier articles informing that there will be a debate on april 29th . 
  from what i see , the april 28th took the spotlight , so the press did n't bother with new articles just one day later . 
  also independence day in romania ( some consider it to be on 10 may , because the declaration was read in parliament on the 9th but signed by the king on the 10th ) . 
  you need to use lighter colors . 
  i find it hard to read the table , and i really really want to study it attentively . 
  could you please please upload another version , with less eye-poking colors . 
  for a fellow boring person ... 
  ~ ~ great ... 
  i 'll be on the train at that hour . 
  dammit ! ~ ~ change of plans . 
  europe day ( aka [ schumann day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day ) ) is may 9 wwii victory in europe is [ may 8 in western europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ve_day ) and [ may 9 in former soviet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_day_%289_may%29 ) europe, 
  barbarians !!, 
  hence the quotation marks . 
  i first heard the euromyth , then i found this article detailing why it 's bullshit . 
  i wonder if there will be an english-subtitled version of the debate in the comming days ?
