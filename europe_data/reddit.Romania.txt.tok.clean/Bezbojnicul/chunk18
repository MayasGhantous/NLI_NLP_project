   with the amount of information on the internet there is really no excuse to be that misinformed . 
  most of the information on the internet is like all human information : 90 % * garbage . 
  getting an internet connection does not automatically grant you the ability to discern bullshit from truth .

  short article : [ minister wants exception for black locust \\ [ aka . 
  white acacia \\ ] on ec invasive species list ] ( http://www.bbj.hu/politics/minister-wants-exception-for-black-locust-on-ec-invasive-species-list_77126 ), 
  i just hope that if we do , we get a little creative , like [ the brits did with their coa on the coins ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a8/new_british_coinage_2008.jpg ) . 
  the law says `` curency minted in romania '' . 
  since romanian euros will not be minted in romania ( iirc ) , we are n't technically required to have the coa on it . 
   i 'd love to have vlad on my money .

   well the posters here mostly post positive news , no point in posting about corruption cases being found out around the country actually , there is a lot of posting here about corruption cases too . 
  but they are starting to be dealt with , so i guess that falls under \u201e positive news '' too ... 
  actually , people here do n't hate the imf like people from latin america ( ? ), 
  hate the imf . 
  we have n't thought about it yet . 
   communism will be no different the oracle has spoken !, 
   an architecture studio from cj who ? 
  romanian and hungarians ... oh boy , there 's one humongous divide there , let me tell you ... 
  also check out [ electric castle ] ( http://www.electriccastle.ro/en ) . 
  everybody i 've talked to said it 's the best organized festival from romania they 've been to , and that last year was extremely awesome . 
  same here . 
  i 've never been there myself , it 's a pretty popular for western romanians and i generally only heard good things about it . 
  what has the eu ever done for us ? 
  thank you so much for the effort !, 
   there is a commune in romania where there are 28 churches ( orthodox , all of them , what else ) . 
  which one ? 
  please do !, 
   in the southwestern city of b\u00e9ziers , robert m\u00e9nard has established a curfew for minors under 13 , who will need to be accompanied by an adult if they wish to be out from 11pm to 6am during the weekends and school holidays of the summer months ( june 15 -- september 15 ) . 
  how very saudiesque of him ... 
  same here . 
   mate , i live in mure\u015f county and not one person i know wants autonomy . 
  i live in oradea , and i know both romanians and hungarians who favor larger autonomy of the region , as well as a lot more people who bitch about excessive centralisation and \u201e decisions made in bucharest '' . 
  the word \u201e autonomy '' has a lot of negative political baggage associated with it given that it 's used by ethnic hungarian and especially szekler political discourse . 
  but ask transylvanians if they \u201e favor more decisions made in transylvania instead of bucharest/southerners '' and i bet a lot more would be in favor of it than if you ask if they are in favor of \u201e autonomy '' . 
  also , our experiences are n't an adequate measurement of opinion , because our circle of acquaintances might not be a representative slice of the local population . 
  so for the sake of correctness , please do n't make up statistics . 
   and like 80 % of the people here , i do n't want autonomy . 
  this is one of those \u201e 63 % of all statistics are made up on the spot '' situations , is n't it ? 
   not even szekelys want autonomy we do n't know that . 
  maybe they do , maybe they do n't . 
  up to today , nobody bothered doing an opinion poll in the area . 
  i do n't really know , but if i had to guess , linguists probably take all aspects into account when comparing two varieties . 
   however , in my opinion , the varieties of romanian within romania are very easily intelligible regardless of where in the country you are from . 
  i remember a train conversation between two middle aged women . 
  one was from south-eastern romania ( do n't remember the city exactly ) and she said when she first met her in-laws ( from bihor , in western romania ) she did n't understand what they were saying . 
  and yeah , they were talking in romanian . 
  also , i remember causing confusion in br\u0103ila , when i said , at the end of a night out drinking , \u201e noah , c\u0103t\u0103 c\u0103\u0219i ! '' . 
  sure , this does not happen often , but someone from north-western romania can make themselves quite unintelligible if they try . 
   but of course i 'm no linguist , and i thought that there must be more substantial differences in order for a language variety to qualify as a dialect . 
  i 'm no linguist either , but i do n't think mutual intelligibility is that big a factor . 
  i mean , african-american vernacular english is considered a dialect ( of american english ) and is quite mutually intelligible with other varieties of american english . 
  i agree that it 's much more in-depth than the first debate , but i liked the dynamic nature of the first debate . 
  maybe a mix of the two would be optimal somehow . 
   sadly , there are no dialects of the romanian language within romania ( anymore ) . 
  we do have differing accents and regionalisms though , but that 's something pretty much every language has . 
  i think the homogeneity of romanian is a tad exagerated , tbh . 
  sure , the differences are greater with the older generation . 
  how is a `` dialect '' different from `` accent + regionalisms '' ? 
  / r/askeurope might be a more adequate place, 
  some of the threads here might be of interest : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=dialect&amp;restrict_sr=on, 
   while the question on who won the debate was left undecided [ some ] ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/verhofstadt-outshines-rival-candidates-in-untidy-debate/80691.aspx ) beg to differ . 
  [ yes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014#european_pirate_party ), 
  in parliament . 
  but not they are not part of the european green party . 
  they have separate candidate ( s ) . 
  ** from the previous debate : ** * [ who won ? 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bmy1rx5caaateq9.png ) ^ \\ ( [ sauce ] ( https://twitter.com/europedecides/status/461114592371154944 ) ) * [ selfies seem to be all the rage now ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bmvf4ifimaa0hvx.jpg ), 
  was looking for this . 
  thank you !, 
  why not ? 
  maybe we could write it as \u201e \u0219pi\u021b-candidat '' . 
  both words exist in romanian . 
  there is no far-right per se , as in hungary for example , but there is a lot of anxiety about being viewed as second-class citizens within the eu . 
  they are n't against the eu , but against the way `` western european '' states treat us . 
  so i would n't say they are pandering to the far-right or the euro-sceptics , but they are incredibly populistic in this case ( their voter core is the rural , uneducated and the elderly ) . 
   ban hammer is strong when anti eu sentiment is at play fyi being euro-skeptic does not get you banned from / r/europe, 
  about the local sd campaign ? 
  well . 
  i was hesitant in the first place to vote psd because [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu ) is still the honorary president of the party , and the amount of corrupt assholes in the party is too damn high . 
  let 's say that the things above could be ignored for the sake of getting schulz some backing . 
  but what annoyed me the most was using aggressive nationalism as their campaign strategy . 
  look at [ this poster ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2014-04-25-17107782-41-psd-apara-romania.jpg ) . 
  the message is `` we 're sending people to bruxelles who are proud to be romanian [ and ] who will defend romania 's interests '' . 
  the slogan is `` proud to be romanian '' and the use of folkloric motifs underscores that . 
  now i agree that not being treated as second class citizens is an important campaign issue , but i profoundly dislike the agressive/primitive way this is done ( us vs them ) . 
  so back to the liberals i go ... 
  i felt this thread to be a bit cluttered tbh . 
   that would be bora ` rus or something i think you 're right  it 's apparently a name of greek origin . 
  does n't sound greek tbh . 
  modern greek has no b or sh sounds . 
  my feeling : * junckers felt like he did n't really want to be there . 
  also , he gave too strong a `` old bruxelles beaurocrat '' vibe . 
  he did have a couple of nice moments though . 
  * keller was full of enthusiasm , which was refreshing , but at the same time made her stand out as a bit naive/idealistic and lacking exprience ( but she 's got potential ) .
