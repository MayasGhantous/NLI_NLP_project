  i felt he was trying to preach and get soundbites rather than actually debate , and then he became rude . 
  also he is starting to get a bit repetitive . 
  i was expecting more from him . 
  * verhofstadt was the most coherent in sketching out a vision ( with which i partially agree with ) , which the other big candidates failed to do . 
  also , i liked his style , and his humor . 
  all in all , i wanted to vote schulz before this debate , but given that the local social-democrats are running a disgusting campaign ( not that i was to eager to vote for them in the first place ) , i think i 'm gon na switch over to the liberals and go for verhofstadt . 
  why ? 
  hey . 
  it would be awesome if you shared your thoughts in the [ post-debate discussion thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/247ir6/postec_president_debate_discussion/ ) as well .

  my feeling : * junckers felt like he did n't really want to be there . 
  also , he gave too strong a `` old bruxelles beaurocrat '' vibe . 
  he did have a couple of nice moments though . 
  * keller was full of enthusiasm , which was refreshing , but at the same time made her stand out as a bit naive/idealistic and lacking exprience ( but she 's got potential ) .

  is n't bor\u00e1ros t\u00e9r - wineseller square ? 
  it appears only tomorrow 's debate will be broadcast by tvr . 
   i do n't even think this should be an argument , as most people already speak english . 
  i 'm just playing devil 's advocate . 
  i actually agree that latin is a silly proposition . 
  not because only only 40 % of europe is romance-speaker , but because less than 1 % ^ ^ \\ ( speculation ) actually speaks * latin * - and as someone who learnt it in school , it ai n't easy even for romance-speakers - , while more than 50 % speak english to some degree , and that proportion is growing fast . 
  not on tvr as far as i can tell http://www.tvr.ro/program.html, 
  the other 60 % also have a lot of latin-derived vocabulary , given the status of latin in the medieval times in western europe . 
  just europe, 
   aparently piss is vizelet or \u201e pisi '' colloquially, 
   we have no other name for the netherlands . 
  used almost never , but we have it . 
  there 's a lot of speculation there . 
  the upswing in declared roma could be due to other factors , besides actual demographic growth . 
  it most likely is due to less reluctance to declare oneself roma . 
  if you look at censuses from the interbellum until today , you can see that the percent of roma fluctuates up and down the most . 
   statistics predict that by 2050 the gypsy population in romania will equal the romanian population . 
  could you quote me those statistics please ? 
  well , / r/europe is what users make of it . 
  i would love more content of news from your country , especially in the sunday news thread . 
  you 're not really wrong , as we 're not actually contradicting each other , 
  the red part . 
  compare with [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/ethnicmacedonia.jpg ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia ), 
  there is a \u201e luxemburg '' region in belgium , yet the belgians are not scared of luxemburgish irredentism , and this is just one example . 
   lev ( abbreviated : lev ) is the currency of bulgaria issued by the bulgarian national bank . 
  it is divided into 100 cents . 
  its name comes from lev - obsolete form of the word '' lion '' , used in the 19th century . 
  please indicate which part of said first sentence contradicts my point ? 
  i never said it does n't come from an old form of the word \u201e lion '' . 
  i just said that the \u201e lion '' it references is the one on the dutch coin , not the one on the coat of arms . 
   the republic of macedonia covers 0 % of the area of ancient kingdom of greek-makedon . 
  and [ ghana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghana ) covers 0 % of the area of the [ medieval ghana empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghana_empire ) , and [ benin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benin ) covers 0 % of the area of the [ benin empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benin_empire ) . 
  just sayin ', 
  from greek \u1f00\u03c4\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( atsinganoi ) or \u1f00\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( athinganoi , literally `` untouchables '' ) . 
  it was given initially to some sect , and later shifted to designate the roma . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gypsy_ ( term ) #tsinganoi, 
  took a trip last weekend ( round here in western romania ) . 
  lots of those fields left and right . 
  but the currency is not named `` lion '' because of the bulgarian coa , but because of the dutch lion-taler . 
  same origin . 
   notice the lions totally unrelated to the name . 
  the name of the currency comes from a dutch coin which was used in the area and [ which had a lion on one of its sides ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/loewentaler.jpg ) ( the `` leeuwendaalder '' , lion-taler ) , the lion from the images of banknotes come from the coat of arms , which come [ from earlier times ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_bulgaria#historical_coats_of_arms ) . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2fc9s2nibe ), 
  makes sense . 
   for a life before the schnitzel wait ... wat ? 
  apart from [ pntcd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_national_peasants%27_party ) , who was swept out of parliament in 2000 and has been pagued by infighting until this year , i have n't seen any campaign advertising . 
  probably because officially , campaigning starts tomorrow . 
  pntcd has been engaging in `` pre-campaign self-promotion '' . 
  basically filling bilboards with posters like [ this ] ( http://www.pntcd.ro/images/slideshow/slide-3.jpg ) ( * '' [ we are ] reborn for your romania '' * ) and [ this ] ( http://www.pntcd.ro/images/slideshow/slide_8u7nyh9dfq0xvg4t.jpg ) ( * `` we defend your romania '' - `` faith - law - dignity '' * ) . 
  parties are probably saving up money for the presidential elections later this year . 
  that 's where the high stakes are . 
  you lost me again , 
  what exactly are these 2 institutions you talk about ? 
  i think the / new queue is acting a bit strange , and it showed this thread as more recent than the megathread . 
   secondly i think a mega thread kills the updating on the topic . 
  from [ the original modpost ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vyc42/mod_please_post_minor_news_photos_videos_in_our/ ) regarding the megathreads :  the things that we 'd prefer to be posted separately are important developments ( examples : ukrainian president resigns , russia/eu/usa invades/bombs ukraine , army opens fire on crowd ) , preferably from major news-sites . 
  declarations , photos , videos , livefeeds or anything like that should be posted in the dedicated thread or in existing threads . 
  --  it just does n't work as well and new updates get buried . 
  each megathread had instructions on how to see new comments first . 
  it is literally one click away , and in ** bold ** :  ** sort this thread by new or [ click here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23jywd/ukraine_megathread_6_post_and_find_all_updates/?sort=new ) to see the latest updates ** --  the last few times we 've had ukraine mega threads i stopped using / r/europe [ 1 ] for info about ukraine . 
  i already use / r/ukrainianconflict [ 2 ] , but it 's also nice to be able to post about it here in europe where you do n't receive massive downvotes for having an anti-putin opinion well , either ukraine-focused people have a hard time on / r/europe or other-topic-focused people have a hard time on / r/europe ( because non-ukraine content is squeezed out ) . 
  a megathread is the best compromise . 
  people who are very interested in ukraine get a sticky thread ( primus inter pares among threads ) at the expense of an extra click , and other people get breathing space , while major developments can still be posted on the front page . 
  please post this in the ukraine megathread .
