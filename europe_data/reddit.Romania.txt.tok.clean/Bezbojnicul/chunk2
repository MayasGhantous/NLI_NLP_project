  the roman-catholics and protestants kept very thorough records afaik , but the orthodox church ( to which most romanians belong to ) were way worse at keeping records , especially in smaller churches , and especially before the 19th century .

  my pleasure .

  there is a nice book in romanian called \u201e [ 101 words of turkish origin ] ( http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/101-cuvinte-de-origine-turc%c4%83 ) '' which is very interesting and goes into the whole history of turkic influence on romanian ( there have actually been multiple layers , both ottoman , in several stages , and pre-ottoman , during the cuman rule ) . 
  i 'm a big fan of linguistics myself , and also hang around / r/linguistics a bit , cause they have a lot of interesting stuff there . 
   unrelated fact , my ancestors migrated from dobruja to istanbul when ottomans lost those lands . 
  i really want to visit there someday . 
  i know it does n't mean anything today but i 'm somehow curious about it . 
  you should definitely visit , it 's nice , and there are still turks and tatars living there ( although a minority nowadays ) . 
  do you know any details about which city/village they came from . 
  maybe other details ? 
  also , you might be interested in the essay on page 121 in [ this book ] ( http://mek.niif.hu/06000/06046/06046.pdf ) . 
  it deals with northern dobruja 's integration into romania . 
  unrelated fact : just came back a month ago from my honeymoon in istanbul . 
  it was a really lovely and interesting mix , 
  i do . 
  words are not \u201e per country '' but \u201e per language '' . 
  romanian is written over romania and is valid for most of moldova as well . 
  the one in the south of moldova is g\u0103g\u0103uz . 
  you will notice the white borders correspond to linguistic boundaries ( see spain , belgium , swizerland , romania , etc. 
  in my defence , wiktionary uses an unusual transliteration from georgian , and i fixed it in the updated map . 
  funny thing is all 3 component words entered to some extent in romanian : * * pazar * - * bazar * , neologism , via french * * kapi * - * c\u0103put * regionalism ( very rare ) , meaning \u201e gate '' , via hungarian \u201e kapu '' ( \u201e gate '' ) * * kule * - * cul\u0103 * the meaning shifted here from \u201e tower '' to a sort of [ fortified boyar house ] ( http://casesicalatorii.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/greceanu19.jpg ) specific to the southern regions of romania , mainly [ oltenia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/oltenia.svg/1024px-oltenia.svg.png ) . 
  outdated , kinda like \u201e jidan '' , but even more rare . 
  also , i do n't think a pole should make fun of how hungarian looks . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's kinda derogatory to use use \u201e ol\u00e1h '' to refer to romanians nowadays , but it was still used normally at the beginning of the 20th century , up until roughly ww2 . 
  [ image from 1906 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gv7cv4g.jpg ) and [ from 1940 ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2138/1517833517_69e687f13e_z.jpg ) . 
  it 's still a common family name ( incidentally a friend of mine , whom i met today , is named that ) . 
   but today it 's only used in reference to a certain ethnicity of roma people . 
  ( `` ol\u00e1h cig\u00e1nyok '' , who incidentally , came over from romania ? 
  i think ) in english , the dialects of the roma that were influenced heavily by romanian are called [ vlax romani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlax_romani_language ) , \u201e vlax '' being etimologically related to \u201e ol\u00e1h '' . 
  yes , they came over after the roma slavery in moldova and wallachia was abolished , in the 1860s . 
  are the names translated as \u201e gate tower '' for bulgaria and \u201e bazar tower '' for greece ? 
  interesting . 
  in what areas are the two versions used ? 
  also , '' c\u00fbleke '' is related to \u201e jew '' etymologically ? 
   bosnian one for jews is n't `` jevrejin '' , it 's `` jevrej '' . 
  ups . 
  will fix . 
   also , do albanians use `` cifut '' as a proper term for jews ? 
  it 's used around here as well but it 's considered derogatory . 
  yes . 
  we have it in romanian as well , but it 's meaning shifted quite a lot . 
  it means something along the lines of \u201e grumpy '' , and nobody would know its original meaning . 
   i wonder who the fuck says these words like that [ low german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_german ) speakers . 
  \u201e [ iudeu ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/iudeu ) '' means either \u201e inhabitant of judeea '' ( as in the biblical context ) or it 's an outdated word for jew , replaced by \u201e evreu '' . 
  also \u201e jidan '' exists , but it 's considered a slur . 
  finnish - word-for-word translation rest - adoption of the german word, 
   not very accurate though ; i do n't think they care all that much for historical accuracy . 
   that map is n't accurate . 
  i know it has problems , but i took it as i found it on wiki commons , and corrected it as people noticed this or that problem . 
  i 'll look into what you said and i 'll try to improve any future maps,

  * anti-corruption * * a huge corruption scandal [ involving top figures of the ruling party ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/uk-romania-corruption-idukkcn0i427t20141015 ) , including the pm 's father-in-law ilie s\u00e2rbu , as well as one of the shadiest mofos in the ruling party , viorel hrebenciuc , regarding some 43000 hectares of nationalized forests given back unlawfully . 
  the damage that was created through romsilva ( the state forest administration agency ) is worth 303.9 million euros . 
  hrebenciuc 's son was also arrested , as well as former romsilva manager . 
  * this case then spawned [ another high-profile case regarding one of the accused ] ( https://uk.news.yahoo.com/romania-starts-corruption-investigation-ruling-party-bosses-162539456.html#lfi1dvm ) . 
  hrebenciuc used his influence to prompt senator \u0218ova to propose a bill on amnesty and pardoning of sentences , the dna said in a statement . 
  if passed into law , it could have have protected hrebenciuc from prison in the previous case . 
  in exchange , hrebenciuc promised \u0218ova he would persuade some members of his party in his ` spheres of influence ' to back him ( to get the party 's head post ) .

  i know sometimes different transliterations can be problematic ( i regularly have georgians correct me because for some reason wiktionary uses an uncommon transliteration , and i guessed this might be something similar ) . 
  i used the transliteration [ given here ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hungary#translations ) ( same as [ here ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%a3%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%80%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0#ukrainian ) ) . 
  just noticed that i updated the map when i originally posted it to / r/etymologymaps but forgot in the meanwhile . 
  so you are right about it being related to ellada . 
  see my top level comment here . 
  yes . 
   what is that blue spot in the cuacasus ? 
  [ kabardian circassian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/northwest_caucasian_languages_map.png ) ( the purple in karachay-cherkesia and kabardino-balkaria ) . 
   google found zero results for `` alyd\u017eej '' that 's because they use cyrillic , and i did the transliteration for this map using the [ omniglot charts ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kabardian.htm ) . 
  in cyrillic it 's \u0410\u043b\u044b\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0439 , and i got it from the [ kabardian wikipedia ] ( https://kbd.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%90%d0%bb%d1%8b%d0%b4%d0%b6%d0%b5%d0%b9 ) * edit *  it also seems that the `` ej '' is just a grammatical ending , interesting . 
  how do you know \u201e - ej '' is a gramatical ending ( and what sort of gramatical ending ) ? 
   so it could easily come from `` ellada '' or similar . 
  ~ ~ sounds plausible , but i 'll need a bit more evidence to update the map tbh . ~ ~, 
  tbh , both the english and the azeri wiktionary only give the \u201e pol\u0219a '' form of the name in the azeri language , so i that 's what i included on the map . 
  looking on the [ azeri wiki ] ( https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/pol%c5%9fa ) also gives no indication of lehistan being used . 
  who knows . 
  seen in edirne , turkey recently : http://i.imgur.com/n1e4cen.jpg, 
  a lot of languages use a derivative of hellene as a more formal/fancy way of saying greece ( romanian \u201e grecia '' vs. \u201e elada '' & \u201e republica elen\u0103 '' ) , but this map focuses on the common everyday name . 
   poland in iran is named `` lechistan '' in what language ? 
  the map does n't really focus on farsi , but more on azeri and kurd speaking areas , and admitedly does so somewhat simplistically , given that the main focus is europe . 
  still , it 's a mutually beneficial thing .
