  please post this in the ukraine megathread . 
  thank you . 
   if they ca n't have two posts stickied simultaneously we ca n't . 
  reddit only allows one sticky at a time . 
  otoh i linked the news thread on the upper most part of the page, 
   i generally agree with the majority view on this sub ( being pro eu , anti-russia , favouring less us involvement in europe , ect ) but find it hard not to acknowledge that one exists here . 
  seconded . 
  that 's a different kind of sub , where answers need to be of a certain kind ( within well defined parameters ) . 
  / r/europe is a more free-for-all type sub . 
  common curtesy is harder to define than academic rigor ( citing sources , etc. ), 
   do you eat mutton in bihor ? 
  only on easter . 
  you can probably get it out of season if you know a butcher who knows a shepherd , or something . 
  i 'm not aware of any turkish butchers here . 
  our turkish minority is still rather insignificant . 
  * stufat * is a southern thing . 
  i have n't even heard of * stufat * until a few years ago , when my gf made some ( delicious stuff ) , and only this year did i find out it 's an easter food . 
  west too . 
  apparently , [ quite a few ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egg_decorating_in_slavic_culture ),

  for those such as myself , who are curious about where belgo actually is : * [ article with map ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%b3%d0%be_\\ ( % d1 % 81 % d0 % b5 % d0 % bb % d0 % be \\ ) ),

  afaik it was some contest , and some primary school kid drew this thing , and funar loved it . 
  the heraldry authority actually said this coa breaks the rules of heraldry . 
  to get a sense of how douchey this new coa is , even the freakin ' communists kept the old coa as part of [ their version of the coa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/rsr_mun_cluj.png ) . 
   i do not envy the european coin collectors . 
  why ? 
  you might also want to x-post to / r/vexillology, 
  oh , get a commonwealth you two !, 
  this is with french fries and a kind of light mayo ( mayo + yoghurt mix or something ) and ketchup . 
  thing is that the turkish immigrants sell kebabs , but gyros was sold before they came ( like , the 90s when there were n't any immigrants ) . 
  maybe i 'll buy one tomorrow and take a few pictures , 
  i really-really want to see a spitzencandidate + localcandidate posters up and down my country . 
  that will definitely get people talking ... 
   bulgarian sarma why do you call it `` bulgarian sarma '' instead of just ... you know ... `` sarma '' ? 
  for some reason gyros was until recently the standard fast-food in my hometown in western romania . 
  because it 's an area of the country far away from where you 'd expect to see a greek minority ( there was no historic greek minority except for some leftist refugees in the 50s ) , and because the spelling looks hungarian ( `` gy '' is common in hungarian , nonexistent in romanian , and '' - os '' is a common hungarian suffix ) , almost everyone thinks it 's a hungarian dish . 
  great map !, 
  i would suggest adding a bit more color to the first level ( < 5 % ) though as it is rather indistinguishable from countries without values . 
  small pipes in inches ( we use the german-derived '' \u0163ol '' unit ) monitor diameters in inches ( we use the english-derived `` inci '' unit ) as mentioned below : horsepower for cars , calories for food energy , nautical miles . 
  also , i 've heard my grandpa use `` v\u00e9ka '' in hungarian for amounts of grain . 
  it used to be an imperial unit , between 7 and 30 litres , but i 'm not sure how much it is now . 
  might be 10 litres , so that would make it a metric unit . 
  something simmilar happened to `` m\u00e1zsa '' ( romanian `` maj\u0103 '' ) , which used to be imperial ( ~ 50-60kg ) , but turned into short for 100kg with metrification . 
   in those days a turk was just a muslim subject of the empire , it did n't matter if you were an albanian , or turk , or an arab . 
  a lot of times `` turk '' and `` greek '' were just bywords for `` muslim '' and `` orthodox '' . 
  we had a wallachian voivode called [ mihnea turcitul ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihnea_turcitul ) , aka mihnea `` the turkified '' , because he converted to islam . 
   israel and iran were allies pre-islamic revolution and there is even significant evidence that suggests they cooperated against saddam post-revolution . 
  there is no historical enmity between the israelis and the persians - you 'll often see demonstrations where iranian youth protest against the funding going to hezbollah and hamas . 
  there are about 250,000 persian jews living in israel . 
  for anyone interested in this relationship , i 'm reading a very good book on the subject : * '' [ treacherous alliance : the secret dealings of israel , iran , and the united states ] ( http://www.amazon.com/treacherous-alliance-secret-dealings-israel/dp/0300143117 ) '' by trita parsi *, 
  awesome , thanks / u/reilly616 !, 
  and narva ... 
   isnt belarus very pro-russian ?? 
  i heard even like 70 % of belorussians rather speak russian then belorussian even to other belorussians . 
  speaking russian does not make a society automatically pro-russia . 
  ireland in 1920 was majority anglophone but there was little love for the uk .

  afaik , one is `` inanimate '' red , the other is `` animate '' red, 
  it makes me laugh more than it pisses me of , that comment . 
  it 's so ridiculously wtf ... 
   once again , being roma is fine , but statistics ca n't just be overlooked just because it does n't sound good to these `` ultra-modern , cosmopolitan '' people who have never interacted with roma people in their lives . 
  people are not arguing about statistics . 
  most people aknowledge that criminality is higher among the roma than the general population . 
  what people argue about is other factors and their influence on the situation . 
  things like the effect of past injustices , family cohesion and family values , policy and its effectiveness , degree of assimilation possible and desirable , livel of education , poverty , explicit and implicit racism and so on , and how all this shit fits together . 
   but being poor does not excuse theft . 
  again , i do n't think people try to excuse things , as much focus on larger group dynamics rather than simple individual personal responsibility . 
  sure , punish a thief , but when one group of people has a higher criminality rate , the question arises if the explanation for that is largely internal to that group or largely external .
