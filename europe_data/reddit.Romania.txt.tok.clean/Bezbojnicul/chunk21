  people who focus on external factors are often accused of making up excuses . 
   i will : as far as hungary is concerned , 9 out of 10 cases of violent crimes are committed by roma people . 
  it 's a statistic , not something that can be argued . 
  since it 's statistic , do you have some source ? 
   this author should move to the eastern border regions of hungary for a year , then we 'd see how different this article would look . 
  how bad is the situation there ? 
  any comprehensive articles on the issue ? 
  also , i 'd be interested to some statistics that compare criminality in western hungary to that in eastern ( so i can further compare to western romania , where i live ) . 
  this has been already posted a couple of times . 
  to be fair , this map lups together both secessionists and autonomists , and both serious movements with movements that are 5 person bad jokes . 
  thanks for the link . 
  this was the most interesting analysis of the election i have seen to date . 
  it made my sunday that much more enjoyable and thought-provoking ( and cooking even less boring ) . 
  keep up the great links , 
  seconded !, 
  actually , there was n't any turkish administration - and turkish population to influence genes - in most of what is today romania . 
  it was mostly internally autonomous ( while externally a vasal to the ottoman empire ) . 
  you guys just invaded now and again when the local ruler got uppity . 
  also in western europe their number is quite significant , so they get to ghettoize more easily . 
  fun fact : ia\u0219i takes its name from an iranian people, 
   1 in 5 voted invalid because of not following the rules i heard that too . 
  on friday . 
   )  over 94 % voted fidesz wow ... 
  any details on how the `` new citizens from neighbouring countries '' voted ? 
   that 's like saying that the holocaust was france 's fault , because of the treaty of versailles . 
  most historians do agree that the treaty of versailles was one of the factors that lead to ww2 . 
  i do agree with the essence of the rest of your comment . 
  kagame is a douchebag who uses the genocide to silence international opposition to his authoritarianism , and \u201e whiteys '' are still paternalistic towards africans . 
  it 's either \u201e they kill each other because of colonialism '' ( not saying it was n't a factor in how things are today ) or \u201e they kill each other because they have always been doing it '' ( as if the rest of humanity was some sort of hippie commune ) . 
  the second option is probably why \u201e the west '' gave so few fucks when the genocide happened . 
   is that guy cool ? 
  [ is joke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imre_nagy ), 
  ** # ** - the one true pound sign, 
  look , i 'm not saying they ca n't be gypsies . 
  of course that is a possibility . 
  i 'm saying that the video is inconclusive ( dat resolution ) , and that this is n't an exclusively gypsy behavior by a long shot , so it 's a big speculation to say they are gypsies . 
   and many sleepless nights due to the fact that outgoing phone calls were 10 times cheaper after 10 pm . 
  good times . 
  oh , i remember that ... , 
   well , romania is not that big for romanians in the south to look , behave and talk differently from the rest of them in the country . 
  i have relatives in the south ( bucharest and br\u0103ila ) , and there are plenty of romanians that look like these guys ( who did n't really look that dark ) . 
  as for talking and behaving differently , they do n't talk that unusual . 
  they could be from any village/commune from around bucharest , and they behave like a bunch of rednecks , of which there 's plenty everywhere in romania . 
  and there is variation within romania , it 's not * that * homogenous . 
  my father-in-law and my uncle are pretty close to the \u201e mediteranean '' side of the spectrum , while some on my mother-in-law 's side are quite the opposite ( \u201e mo\u021b '' type - blonde , blue-eyed , rosy-cheeked ) . 
   anyway , speculations aside , that was a horrible thing to do . 
  totally agreed !, 
  so one gains distinction in english , but retains ambiguity in some of the other languages . 
  given english 's role as lingua franca , i still think it 's a step in the right direction . 
  also , \u201e speaker '' is the least important , when we have 2 other institution heads that are basically \u201e pres. 
  de c. e. '' . 
  having one be \u201e president de conseil europ\u00e9ene '' and the other \u201e chef de comission europ\u00e9ene '' is again , a step in the right direction . 
   it means earthworm . 
  \u201e giliszta '' is earthworm afaik . 
  \u201e kukac '' is something like a \u201e small worm '' ( like the one you find in apples ) . 
   i 've been on the internet since 1995 ten-hut !, 
  there 's an officer on deck . 
  * salutes *, 
   for the young generation is `` at '' . 
  i 've heard \u201e arond '' way more often than \u201e at '' . 
  there is nothing to suggest the youngsters are roma . 
  especially at this resolution . 
  they could be , but they could also be romanians from the south . 
  at the beginning of the internets , when we had to come up with a name for it , it was called `` coad\u0103 de maimu\u021b\u0103 '' but it 's rarely used any more , and has a dated feel to it . 
  `` arond '' - as you said - is by far the most popular . 
   i think the way forward is to strengthen the european parliament and transfer most of the power there - where the electoral process is well defined and uniform across member states . 
  ep agree with you , and so do , i suspect , most people . 
   i support the eu and the plans for an eu military force but surely this kind of stuff should be sorted out first ? 
  i mean why do we need four presidents ?!, 
  i agree , those names should be changed . 
  i propose : * speaker of ep , * chief-commisioner , * head of the council of eu ... 
   they 're 7 % of the population . 
  but they are 20 % of transylvania , [ unevenly distributed ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/maghiarii_din_romania_%282002%29.png/640px-maghiarii_din_romania_%282002%29.png ) , which is the area they are found in . 
  sure , i 'm not saying the situation are identical . 
   but i think it underscores the social differences when even major holidays do n't fall on the same dates . 
  well , except for christmas , easter is different for us ( and so are all the other stuff that are connected to easter ) , and our national days are a bit polar opposites . 
  our national day is when transylvania chose to unite with romania ( which is not exactly a happy day for them , to put it lightly ) and their national day is march 15 , which celebrates their 1848 uprising , in which we were on opposite sides of the fight , and our to uprisings slaughtered the fuck out of each other ( plus some civilians ) with the end result that a couple of decades later they got their dualism , and it was n't exactly happy times for romanians . 
  so yeah ... 
   are the hungarian schools 100 % hungarian ? 
  anything besides the romanian language is taught in hungarian ( * see below * ) . 
  they used to have romanian history and romanian geography in romanian , but that is counterproductive imo , since the point is to get them to understand the subject , which is done more easily in the native language . 
   sensitive topics , like history , also should n't be taught in russian as i said , i think it 's silly to cling to this . 
  \u201e latvia was occupied by the soviet union '' is a true statement regardless of the language you teach it in . 
   because it is n't unheard-of for books that , say , deny the occupation of latvia by the ussr are found ( happened just recently ) . 
  i do n't think that the medium of instruction is to blame , but lack of discipline in schools , tbh . 
   hungary does n't have the ` muscle ' to foment unrest and `` shake '' the government of romania using the hungarian ethnic minority . 
  i know that you have problems , but that is nowhere near the disproportionate force that russia has on latvia . 
  while they do meddle in \u201e our affairs '' so to speak , you\u021bre right that they do not compare to russia . 
  plus that in the big picture , they are our allies in nato and our companions within the eu , which dampens inter-governmental tensions .

  1 / 2011 deal with education in minority languages :  ** article 45 ** ( 1 ) persons belonging to national minorities have the right to study and receive instruction in their mother tongue at all pre-university levels , types and forms of school education according to the law . 
  [ ... ]  ** article 46 **  ( 1 ) in the pre-university education in minority languages , all subjects are taught in the minority language except \u201e romanian language and literature '' . 
   ( 2 ) the subject \u201e romanian language and literature '' is taught throughout pre-university education after school programs and textbooks specifically made for the respective minority . 
  [ ... ]  ( 8 ) primary , secondary and high-school teaching in minority languages , the disciplines history and geography of romania are taught in the minority languages , according to school programs and textbooks identical to those for romanian-language classes , with the requirement that place-names and proper names be transcribed and learned in romanian as well . 
   basically , we have different schools , different newspapers , different tv channels , different entertainment . 
  same is true to some level regarding hungarians in romania ( although schools can be either mixed or mono-ethnic ) . 
   they do n't even celebrate christmas on the same date . 
  it 's easter in the case of romanians and hungarians ( christmas is the same ) . 
  but you make it sound like it 's something serious ... 
   what you do n't seem to mention is that nowhere in europe do linguistic minorities get to study in schools in their language that are funded by the state - at least , nowhere near to the levels at which it is in latvia .
