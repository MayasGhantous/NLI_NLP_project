  what levels would that be ? 
  romania has state-funded hungarian schools all the way up to 12 ^ th grade , and we 'll soon have hungarian language colleges in t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 ( medical university ) . 
   every philipino person was catholic philipinos are overwhelmingly catholic . 
  there is also the fact that christians are viewed with distrust by many authoritarian and dictatorial states , being seen as western/american agents ( especially since many converts are to american neo-protestant denominations ) . 
  that was the case in communist eastern europe , and that is the case in china and north korea and presumably vietnam as well . 
  my father said the best lasagna he ever ate was in oslo . 
  way better than those in italy . 
  so yeah ... 
  and finland ... and sweden ... , 
   china 's interests are with the west in such a scenario , i think their interest is to sit by and let russia , the west and japan to go at each other 's throats . 
  you are a gentleman and a scholar !, 
   this is n't the only mistake apparently : i should have specified in the title that this data represents the share of renewables in energy consumption , not production . 
  oh well , it 's my first map , something had to go wrong . 
  do n't worry , happens to me all the time . 
  btw . 
  could you post an updated version ( + no ) in the comments ? 
   it should be even higher for 2013 , a considerable amount of wind and solar has been installed in 2012-2013 ( total should be over 35 % ) . 
  even cooler . 
  thanks !, 
  the table in the source includes norway . 
  why did n't you include it in the map ? 
  we do n't suck !, 
  in case you were wondering about them downvotes ... since we have that sub , `` tourist in europe '' type questions tend to get downvoted here . 
   like in that perverted noah movie ? 
  out of curiosity , what did n't you like about the movie ? 
  i think eu citizens already had visa-free travel to moldova for quite some time . 
  or romania ... 
  it gives a latin ( - american ) vibe , and a politically charged kind of vibe . 
   except maybe some romanians , we used to compete in everything from our perspective , we still do . 
  and yes , we do care . 
  we always know we 're gon na be at the end of every eurostat report , but the important question is `` did bulgaria beat us , or did we beat them and are second-to-last , instead of last ??? '', 
   and now they can fondly look down on us from their high horse . 
  you 're still to close to us to look down on . 
  our go-to countries are albania and moldova . 
  not really . 
  the more connected transnistria is to the eu , the more it will hurt them if they want secession . 
   i kind of like this design . 
  does n't stray from the original too much . 
  i 'm sure the cubans , the portoricans and some catalans like it , but i 'm not a big fan tbh ... 
   well on a serious note if russia were ever to join the eu , having a flag with the double-headed eagle would go some way to appease nationalists how about a double-headed robin ? 
  give us the other 9 , will ya ... 
  not belarus, 
  me too . 
  in a heartbeat !, 
   or roman people .

   as for the scramble for africa , we were just protecting european minorities there . 
   says who ? 
  i remember tax inflow actually rising after the introduction of the flat tax . 
  had the amount of people stayed the same , the inflow would have been smaller , so the it meant that less people were evading the tax . 
   tax evasion is still very very common . 
  i never said it became a rarity . 
  funny thing is , going from a progressive to a flat income tax ( of 16 % ) reduced tax evasion in romania , and is a very popular thing here .

  you should also try / r/askeurope , you might get more lucky with the answers there . 
  poor taste ? 
  it 's awesome !, 
  and i say this as an eastern european ... 
   groups that make up  10 % of the population in their homeland . 
  i think you mean ** < 10 % ** ( less than 10 percent ) . 
  i do n't really understand this surprise with digging holes at the beach . 
  it just seems like the natural thing to do there , together with building forts . 
   let 's allow us to rock plural flairs cumbersome to implement . 
  ( can not be automated , must be done on a case by case basis ) . 
   i do n't even know if hungarian stereotypes really exist , except for food . 
  stereotypes about hungarians ? 
  of course they exist . 
  way more trouble than it 's worth . 
  it would have to be made by hand , on request . 
  there is no way to automate it i 'm afraid ... 
  ... maybe, 
   are gypsy kings in the news a lot yes . 
  florin cioab\u0103 used to make the news quite often , and his death was a big deal , news-wise . 
   i doubt that 's common knowledge . 
  it is . 
   and good companies are usually international , so it leaves lithuanian pretty much for speaking with parents and friends . 
   but is n't it like this everywhere ? 
  i 'd say this is somewhat true only of large multinationals in bucharest and maybe cluj , and only in a multilingual work environment ( somebody more familiar with this should correct me ) . 
  in informal setting , people switch back to romanian among romanians . 
  `` worst case '' scenario , they use romglish , i.e. 
  romanian with lots of english words .
