  i do understand that the baltics are a little more anxiety stricken about their language , given recent history ( soviet russification ) , but yeah , i do n't think the languages are endangered by the internet tbh . 
   if you ask most baltic professionals which language they use at work , however , you will get a different story . 
  more often than not , multilingual balts will say they start to use a larger proportion of english words when explaining the technical aspects of their trade , mixing in english terminology with their mother language . 
  english is increasingly becoming the language of the boardroom , the product presentation , and professional shop talk , effectively tipping the linguistic scales . 
  a latvian talking to another latvian about `` technology , software , and business '' will still talk in latvian . 
  sure , the vocabulary will be full of anglicism , but it 's still latvian , just like talking about phylosophy will probably get you a conversation full of hellenisms and germanisms . 
  romanian plumbing jargon is full of german words , naval jargon full of turkish and greek iirc . 
  ever hear a chef talk about his trade ? 
  half the words are french . 
  and so on ... 
  it 's still romanian , irregardless of of high level of [ foreign ] vocabulary . 
  [ indeed ] ( http://www.dorincioaba.ro/images/dorincioaba.ro/regintern.jpg ), 
  dorin cioab\u0103 and daniel cioab\u0103 - both kings ( see above ) - are both the sons of late king florin cioab\u0103 who in 1992 proclamed himself `` international king of the roma '' . 
  these titles `` king '' and `` emperor '' hold little walue , and are mostly for show . 
  otoh florin cioab\u0103 was indeed a * buliba\u015f\u0103 * ( sort of a community leader/elder ) , but one for the local [ kalderash ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalderash ) roma ( roma are quite fragmented into different subgroups ) . 
   anybody knows a book about gipsy history and customs ? 
  a starting point could be angus fraser 's '' [ gypsies ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-gypsies-angus-fraser/dp/0631196056 ) '', 
  also `` boners '' and `` circlejerk '' . 
  man , reddit sure has a lot of sexual vocabulary in it . 
  which isnt that suprising when one thinks of its demographic ... , 
  they never left ... 
  actually , seeing a green-yellow color scheme , i automatically assumed these countries are in the \u201e ok-to-neutral/mildly bad '' range of things . 
  given both the recent events , and my bias as an eastern european , i was expecting a more dependence = red = more screwed . 
  red-yellow-green colors schemes are powerful things , instantly recognizable as \u201e bad-neutral-good '' indicators . 
  i was [ strongly reminded of this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vz6wr/share_of_young_people_in_the_eu_aged_2534_who_are/cexa4lt ) not that long ago . 
  dat color-scheme, 
  suggestion : you should have used a * sequential * ^ 1 color scheme in map 2 . 
  using a * diverging * one makes it seem as if things turn positive once dependence falls under ~ 35 % . 
  it also made the map a bit difficult to read . 
  ^ 1 or maybe a brown * sequential * between 15-100 , and a light green on the -15 , since only one country is on the negative also a disclaimer on map 2 , so people wo n't think it refers only to russia . 
  otoh , props on using [ colorbrewer ] ( http://www.colorbrewer2.com/ ) , and on making these maps,

  well , how would one ad `` general level of political trust '' to the maps ? 
   good thing is you posted the link to the data but you still have to look through all that shitload of information  you can find the data to trust of national resp . 
  european parliament here on page 43 resp . 
  i explicitly stated the pages in my first comment . 
   basically tells us nothing about tendencies of trust in national and/or european parliament but just the difference it was n't intended as a long time tendency indicator . 
  it was intended as precisely that . 
  a map of differences of trust . 
  of the relation between the trust on national level versus european level . 
  well , i linked to the data , where you can see individual trust levels . 
  that 's what the survey measured . 
  it was me who turned the data into a measurement of which one they trust more . 
  i think it 's because they are [ candidate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_candidate_countries ) [ countries ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/further_european_union_enlargement.svg/1000px-further_european_union_enlargement.svg.png ) . 
   i wish they 'd just polled for the trust levels individually . 
   you do n't know if they trust either a lot or little now . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
   the map is imho misleading . 
  it tries to cover highly fluid processes by making a snapshot . 
  well it is a graphic representation of a snapshot : eurobarometer 79 of may-june 2013 . 
  eurobarometer 80 ( autumn 2013 ) did not have both sets of data needed . 
  maybe when eurobarometer 81 comes out ( summer 2014 ) , if they have the data i need , i can make another set of maps , and we can compare it with the numbers from 2013 so we get a small idea of recent evolution . 
   0 trust actually it 's 25 % trust in ep , and 25 % trust in national parliament . 
  so the difference between the 2 is 0 % . 
   czech republic ones are very interesting , considering they 're the most euroskeptic members . 
  also take note that stats changed since the stats were taken . 
  trust in ep was 47 % in may-june 2013 , but according to [ news ] ( http://praguemonitor.com/2014/03/11/poll-34-czechs-trust-eu-lowest-number-ever ) from our [ sunday thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20jplo/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cg47xp1 ) , it 's now at 30 % . 
  trust/distrust in the eurocommision is [ on page 73 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_anx_en.pdf ) . 
  some southern european ( spain , portugal , cyprus ) states are less trustful/more distrustful than the uk . 
  ** ps ** numbers seem to show little difference between ep and ec : ** trust : ** ec-24 % vs ep-25 % ** distrust : ** ec-58 % vs ep-62 %, 
  yeah , the uk seems to trust/distrust both parliaments equally . 
  source : standard [ eurobarometer 79 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_en.htm ) - [ pdf ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_anx_en.pdf ) ( may-june 2013 ; pages 43 and 72 ) . 
  this is basically the diference between % who say they trust the national parliament and % who say they trust the european parliamnet , and the second map is difference between % of distrust in each . . a positive score means more trust in the ep , respectively less distrust in the ep , a negative score means less trust in ep , more trust in national parliament . 
   he 'd invade moldova before our president flipped to page 2 of the nato treaty . 
  also , you stand no chance of nato membership as long as you have an ongoing military conflict ( with russian `` peacekeepers '' , mind you ) on your territory . 
   the most current numbers of imports from russia that i 've seen put us at 11 % , which is quite good compared to other countries in the region . 
  well , i was thinking in regional terms , not just national . 
  it 's no use to us to be independent , when the rest of eastern europe is still sensitive to russian blackmail . 
   i 'm interested whether it has been discussed elsewhere . 
  this is a common discussion here since 1989 . 
  i really wish people did n't abandon nabucco . 
   however , in poland , you can be assured that there are plenty of paranoid people , politicians and especially radio commentators .
