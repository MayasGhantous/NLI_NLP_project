   population in sevastopol without not allowed to vote ( ca . 
  20 % according to population pyramid available online ) is 320000 . 
  i do n't understand this sentence . 
  could you please rephrase it ? 
  and now you are an example of `` regionalisation done right '' . 
  we 're struggling with this issue ourselves . 
  that was debunked . 
  it was a misquote of the total number of voters by itar-tass . 
   yet the ones in presevo valley were not given that presevo also saw an insurgency against the serb gov ` t , i doubt they were somehow spared discrimination . 
  bad analogy . 
  splitting a large administrative unit composed of multiple settlements is different than splitting a settlement . 
  the difference is that albanians were heavily discriminated in serbia , as opposed to russians in ukraine . 
  * inb4 ukrainian parliament revoked language law . 
  * - revocation was vetoed by acting president , and that is still peanuts compared to kosovar albanians in the 90s . 
   because polls would n't make a difference . 
  [ ... ] would polls encourage the romanian government to grant them autonomy it would be a strong argument against the `` people do n't want autonomy '' line . 
  more than `` i lived in szekelyfold for decades , i do n't need polls . '', 
   also , that `` there are hungarian politicians in the government '' argument is a strawman . 
  look at the positions they got ; they hold no decision-making power . 
  [ ... ] so their politicians being in the coalition does n't mean anything ; tokes was n't made pm was he ? 
  show me which appointee has any real power . 
  having the power to take down a government is a strong negotiating position . 
  do n't act like they have n't won things through negotiations . 
  they do n't need to have a pm . 
  the power is not within the miniserial posts . 
  it 's within the initial negotiations and the subsequent power to destabilize the gov ` t. 
   they did n't promise a single thing to the hungarian community , because they did n't need to ; rmdsz is a corrupt group that 's fine with just being paid well , regardless of the situation of the hungarian community . 
  well then the hungarian community has nobody to blame but themselves , since they elected them . 
   have you spoken to hungarians in szekelyfold ? 
  i have relatives there . 
  grandparents , uncles , cousins . 
  so yeah . 
   i lived there for more than enough time and the villages there did n't get a damn concrete road even though they applied years ago . 
  all this while hungarian politicians were in coalition in bucharest . 
  this is not something exclusive to the area  they actually get along they actually do , believe it or not . 
   most hungarians do n't care for autonomy i have no idea if most do or do not want . 
  so far , neither the central government , nor the hungarian politicians in romania have had the balls to conduct a poll gauging the opinion of the szeklers . 
  also , i asked for sources for your above 2 claims . 
  all i got was ranting . 
   the czech republic is n't even in nato yes it is . 
  you might be thinking of austria . 
  plus , the hungarian party in the ruling coalition supports the move . 
   i clarified what i meant by vocabulary - verbs and nouns , which are the most important types of words in any language , thus those which define it . 
  you 're just cherrypicking . 
   it 's directly indo-european . 
  there is no such thing as `` directly indo-european '' as opposed to germanic . 
   the map is incorrect . 
  latin is not an unofficial part of the english language . 
  england + wales are covered under `` unofficial/historical usage '' . 
  i think the accent here falls on `` historical usage '' . 
   the hungarian party has parliamentary representation and they 're now part of the government and they support the ban . 
   the szekely regions were n't poor when they were still part of hungary ; where could i find statistics regarding regional wealth in pre-wwi hungary . 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
   but then why not return it to hungary ( as an exclave ) ? 
  have there been any polls done on whether they would want reunification with szeklerland ? 
  hungarian sources are also fine . 
   ** this ** would n't be happening what exactly ? 
   when in fact we can agree that romance is an official part of the language . 
  the same way greek , hindi and guarani are an official parts of the language . 
  that still does n't make english a romance language . 
  see [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/bpqa1/is_english_more_similar_to_other_germanic/ ) over at / r/linguistics, 
   ** english is as much of a ** romance language ** as ** romanian . 
   ** this ** comment ** has more ** romance vocabulary ** and ** structure ** in it than anything else ** . 
  i took the liberty of ** bolding ** the germanic words of your comment . 
  as you can see , only 3 out of 10 words in you first sentence , and 4 out of 13 words in your second are of romance origin . 
  so your comment is pretty much bullshit when it comes to vocabulary . 
   most of the important words , verbs and nouns , we 're using here are romance . 
  actually , the core vocab is germanic . 
   words in germanic are formed by agglutination . 
  in romance and english , they 're not . 
  english [ is capable of agglutinating morphemes of solely germanic origin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agglutination#extremes_of_agglutination ) . 
  english is germanic , with a strong romance influence . 
  it is clearly germanic , and its evolution from old english is clearly documented . 
  i feel : * european * eastern european * balkan ( to some extent ) * romanian ( citizen ) * fele-fele ( means `` half-half '' , half-ethnic-romanian , half-ethnic-hungarian ) * transylvanian ( to an extent ) * [ oradean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradea ) - ian and so forth , depending on context, 
  see [ this comment here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/20mmbw/123_of_sevastopols_population_voted_to_join_russia/cg4r0qf ), 
  the article seems to be bs . 
  see my comment below . 
  went digging a bit . 
  found [ this ] ( http://www.c-inform.info/news/id/770 ) :  according to information in the crimea in the referendum voted 1,250,427 people , or 81.36 % , in sevastopol - * 274 136 ** , or 89.51 % . 
  grand total ** 1,524,563 ** voters , or 82.71 % . 
  ( via [ g!translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.c-inform.info%2fnews%2fid%2f770 ) ) so yeah , it seams to be bullshit . 
  they just changed 1 . 
  ** 5 ** 24.5 ** 63 ** into 1 . ** 7 ** 24.5 ** 36 ** . 
  i also did the math regarding voters . 
  89.51 % ( 274,136 ) turnout translates into a total number of 306,263 voters , which is actually smaller than 385,462 given by the crimean statistics office quoted by pravda.ua . 
  you 'd have to ask / u/reilly616, 
  carts use a different license system than cars . 
  they are something [ like this ] ( http://cdn.clubafaceri.ro/clients/1/60500/58/placute-de-inregistrare-pentru-utilaje-mopede-si-carute-38034_big.jpg ) ( yellow , with settlement name , 2-letter county code and a number ) . 
  it 's not uncommon to have unlicensed carts , afaik . 
  the reason the plates are unlike the one i mentioned is because carts often stick used license plates ( from imported cars or whatnot ) so they have a reflective surface and are visible at night by cars . 
  many accidents have happened because of badly visible carts . 
   kosovo and south sudan - legal in the later case , [ north ] sudan accepted the secession , unlike serbia, 
   many opponents boycotted the vote plus  there was no option for those who wanted the constitutional situation to remain unchanged . 
  make the results not that surprising . 
  otoh  unconfirmed reports put the turnout in sunday 's vote at 80 % with ~ 60 % russians makes it odd . 
  i doubt ukrainians and tatars voted in enough numbers to add the remaining 20 % . 
  it 's a well known phenomenon . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nouveau_riche  [ ... ] sociologically , nouveau riche describes the man or woman who previously had belonged to a lower social class and economic stratum ( rank ) within that class ; and that the new money -- which constitutes his or her wealth -- allowed upward social mobility and provided the means for [ conspicuous consumption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspicuous_consumption ) , the buying of goods and services that [ signal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sign_value ) membership in an upper class they just take it to a whole new level . 
  not unlike [ post-soviet oligarchs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjwybcbpiwa ) , 
  it 's spreading !,
