  story has it that they convicted him of something , and as a sort of revenge , he told the judges he will build a house to live in that looks just like the courthouse , but he 'll write his name on the frontispiece . 
  the dude died in a car crash in 2012 . 
  his wealth was said to have been ~ 4 mil .

   it 's not like russia did anything to prevent iraq or libya , outside of strong worded letters . 
  they had no strong interests there . 
  as opposed to syria for example ... 
  ** romania ** * this week 's top story was \u201e hungarians '' * on march 10 there was a pro-autonomy rally in t\u00e2rgu-mure\u0219 , that degenerated into [ pushing and shoving ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlu03rqfrpy ) between the gendarms and a far-right organisation from hungary ( [ hvim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-four_counties_youth_movement ) ) . 
  as a reaction , hungarian extremists from four different organizations ( including [ jobbik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ) leaders ) [ were declared ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20fvia/romania_bars_hungarian_extremists_on_eve_of/ ) \u201e persona non-grata '' and [ barred from entering the country ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/14/us-romania-hungarians-idusbrea2d1qj20140314 ) ( the initial proposal was banning all members , but that was impossible , so they banned proeminent members ) . 
  the [ hungarian party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmr ) , member of the ruling coalition , supported the move . 
  among things declared this week , [ l\u00e1szl\u00f3 t\u0151k\u00e9s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laszlo_tokes ) , mep for romania , said that without autonomy , hungarians will end up like the crimean tatars . 
  this caused a bit of agitation . 
  on march 15 , the day of hungarians [ was celebrated , without incidents ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/stiri/ziua+maghiarilor+sarbatorita+fara+incidente+autonomie ) . 
  once again , the hungarian politicians ' main request was `` autonomy '' . 
  given that both ep elections and hungarian parliamentary elections are close , and people with hungarian citizenship from romania can vote , everything is/was used to score political points .

  make a new post , and i 'll sticky it . 
  sure , as long as they loose their jobs as meps when they become ministers . 
  you 're either a full-time minister , or a full-time mep . 
  also , i do n't think being voted by 50 % +1 of the citizens of upstich-sur-v\u00eelk gives more you `` democratic legitimacy '' to be pm , which is a national position . 
  i live in a 4 room apt . 
  owned by my parents ( my parents live someplace else ) . 
  we ( my gf and i ) only use one of the rooms , the rest being virtually without furniture . 
   do you expect that you will own a house sometime soon ? 
  not really . 
  there might be the possibility of the apartment being signed over to my name , making me de jure owner , but given that i intend to emmigrate , i do n't think i 'll be an owner any time soon . 
   how 's the situation in your country in general . 
  most people are homeowners , or intend to be as soon as possible . 
  renting is seen as throwing money out the window , and is good for temporary situations ( 5 years of college out of town , and so on ) . 
   so he 's technically right . 
  no , he 's technically wrong , because he said `` london and its minority whites '' . 
  london has a white majority . 
  as shown above . 
   sub-saharan africans are genetically very distant from modern humans goodbye, 
  i agree , based on voting patterns and comments . 
   now you look at london and its minority whites this is a blatant lie . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london#ethnic_groups  according to the office for national statistics , ** based on the 2011 census estimates , 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of london were white ** , with 44.9 per cent white british , 2.2 per cent white irish , 0.1 per cent gypsy/irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as other white .

  * later edit * : a somewhat relevant discussion on / r/askhistorians regarding [ jews and `` blending in '' to escape nazis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1zxwka/what_kept_jews_from_blending_in_during_wwii/ ), 
   something udmr never has when it supports the government . 
  all their ambitions are political capital for elections . 
  how does udmr not have \u201e ambitions and plans of their own '' ? 
  sure , they will always be a junior partner , due to their nature as an ethnic party , so their strategy is derived from that fact . 
   all their ambitions are political capital for elections . 
  other parties care about \u201e political capital for elections as well '' . 
  i do n't see any exceptionalism here . 
  it 's not as if udmr has n't obtained concessions for the hungarian minority ( its electorate ) via the coalitions it entered , btw . 
   considering the political arena is insulated and has large `` fences '' to keep plebs out of the process . 
  one of the things keeping udmr 's monopoly on the hungarian electorate is the 5 % hurdle . 
  hungarians fear migrating to another hungarian party because they might loose their 5-6 % and end up with just 1 mp . 
  lowering it to 3 % might enable a bit more democracy within the hungarian voting block . 
  try / r/askeurope as well . 
   there would be no natively english speaking countries left of any consequence . 
  except ireland . 
  i agree that the head-count would drop to make it less significant though . 
   if this was true , they would have got this chance . 
  i 'm not sure i follow . 
   they just have weak egos and ca n't share . 
  again , what do you mean ? 
   udmr only wants to keep power i feel this is true for all political parties in general . 
   udmr is worried about these extremists now too ( afaik they usually are not against them ) they always have been . 
  i have never heard them saying anything remotely positive about jobbik . 
   but now they are worried they might vote for magyar parties between 2008 and 2012 the share of those voting for non-udmr hungarian parties has actually dropped on the local level afaik . 
  i think it 's apathy that is more dangerous to them ( hungarians are getting sick of them , but the alternatives are even less palatable )  the szekler council that 's and ngo . 
  you might be thinking of pcm ( hungarian civic party ) , which is the political party associated with the szekler national council . 
  kinda nothing tbh .

   what would happen if their next [ us ] president can only speak spanish ? 
  subtitles would happen . 
  dubbing would happen . 
  translators would happen . 
   just wondering , how would you feel if you could only understand your leaders , talking to you , through an interpreter ? 
  i would n't care tbh . 
   why not make it a job requirement to be proficient in english ? 
  i see no point . 
  out of curiosity , what 's your native languages , and how many other languages that are official in the eu do you speak ? 
   i 'm curious as to what 's the situation with hungarians ( or other minorities ) in romania in dealing with regional/local authorities . 
  the same 20 % applies . 
  excerpt from the [ law 215/2001 of local public administration ] ( http://lege5.ro/gratuit/gmzdqnzugy/law-no-215-2001-on-local-public-administration/ ) :  ** art . 
  ** - in the territorial-administrative units in which the citizens belonging to the national minorities by a share of over 20 % of the number of the inhabitants , the local public administration authorities shall ensure , in the relations with them , also the use of the mother tongue , in keeping with the provisions of the [ constitution ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?id=371 ) , of the present law and of the international conventions to which romania is a party . 
  and  ** art . 
  **  ( 1 ) the local council shall meet , monthly , on ordinary sittings , upon the convening by the mayor . 
   ( 2 ) the local council may also meet in extraordinary sittings at the request of the mayor or of at least one third of the number of the council 's members .
