   not words in the wind banning jobbik members : words in the wind . 
  ( this was the initial proposition ) banning the jobbik leader : not words in the wind . 
  * for all euroredditors in general : * our pm said the following : `` european citizens who belong to a party can not be denied entry into romania for the simple reason that we can not ask them for their party membership card when entering the country , but we can prohibit the presence of an individual in romania and i sent to the president of romania the material prepared by the interior ministry regarding the activity of jobbik president gabor vona '' apparently the hungarian party ( udmr ) also supports the move [ source ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-16800900-guvernul-sesizat-presedintia-privind-activitatea-liderului-jobbik-vona-gabor-ponta-nu-putem-interzice-intrarea-romania-unor-cetateni-europeni-care-apartin-unui-partid-insa-putem-interzice-prezenta-une.htm ), 
   known as the szeklers , the ethnic minority predominately live in the region of transylvania , especially an eastern part they call szekler land ( tinutul secuiesc ) correction . 
  they are not a distinct ethnic minority . 
  they overwhelmingly identify as hungarian , but they do have a strong regional identity ( think something like the bavarians - ethnic germans with a strong regional identity ) . 
  only about half of transylvanian hungarians are szekler though . 
   in 2002 the estimated ethnic composition of szekler land consisted of hungarians ( 61 percent ) , romanians ( 33 percent ) , germans ( 3 percent ) and roma ( 3 percent ) . 
  why on earth are they using the 2002 census figures ? 
  the 2011 numbers have been available for over a year . 
  i assume they took the combined numbers of mure\u015f , harghita and covasna counties and came up with the above ethnic figures ( [ see map 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/szekely04.png ) ) . 
  thing is that only the central and eastern parts of mure\u015f were part of szeklerland ( [ map 2 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/t%c3%b6rt_sz%c3%a9kelyf%c3%b6ld.png/1024px-t%c3%b6rt_sz%c3%a9kelyf%c3%b6ld.png ) ) , and afaik the szeklers do n't really want the other parts of mure\u015f county to be part of the autonomy ( [ map 3 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/szekely_land_issues.svg/1100px-szekely_land_issues.svg.png ) ) . 
   romanian president traian basescu has asked the romanian government and parliament to ban hungarian `` extremist '' party jobbik ** and its members from the country . 
  ** i 'm no fan of these idiots , but i 'm curious if this violates freedom of movement across the eu ? 
  anybody more knowledgeable than me have any idea ? 
  [ all hail !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/iceland_stockfish_coa.svg/500px-iceland_stockfish_coa.svg.png ), 
  then it must be something else . 
  maybe phonetics . 
  idk . 
  how about [ transnistria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) ? 
  theyeven had [ many referendums ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_in_transnistria ) . 
   \u0ca0_\u0ca0 i think slovaks have the stress on the first syllable - due to hungarian influence - , so that 's why it sounds `` hungarian-ish '' . 
  but i think i could guess most of them both by reading and by listening . 
  slovak is the easiest to tell apart ( has a hungarian accent ) . 
  then east slavic from rest . 
  and so on . 
  i can get the general feeling of which group they belong to , and work my way from there by exclusion . 
  telling norwegian apart from danish ( written forms ) is impossible imo . 
  spoken , much more easy ( between no , sv - has a distinct rhythm - and dk - `` potato-in-mouth '' ) . 
  i have n't heard enough icelandic or faroese to be able to tell them apart . 
  rest of germanic ( non-scandinavian ) are fairly easy . 
  someone should design a test for this . 
   when i hear greek , i immediately think spanish . 
  i do n't know why [ you 're not the only one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1gsbuf/quantifying_the_similarity_of_the_sound_of_a/ ) ( i also had the same impression on first hearing greek ) . 
  i think it 's because their sound inventory is pretty close . 
  i have n't been following the issue in detail tbh . 
  i know they reached a consensus as to who would go to which foreign meetings , but i could n't tell you exactly . 
   i think i 'm right in saying that cohabitation is likely to end with the upcoming presidential election most likely . 
  the center-right is split , so they will probably lose . 
  what that effect that will have on this issue i can not tell . 
   you mean the classic ` feels , not facts ' ? 
  i prefer the `` feels , not realls '' version of the saying . 
  ok . fair enough . 
   but again romania is the exception there since the president officially handles foreign affairs . 
  this used to be the case with finland too , so they changed it . 
  romania is likely to follow suit actually ) . 
  there actually was some debate about this very issue when the current [ cohabitation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohabitation_\\ ( government \\ ) ) began . 
  * edit * . 
  fixed link, 
  correction on schulz 's statement that only france elects its president : so does romania ( and wiki tells me that portugal too ) . 
  do n't message one . 
  message all via modmail , for quicker response . 
  stickied the thread , 
   i did n't say that dictionaries define meaning , did i ? 
  i said that they serve as recognized guides to ensure mutual intelligibility . 
  i check dictionaries to make sure i 'm getting a spelling or meaning correct . 
  in practice this differs little from the function of an authoritative manual . 
  so , they do define the meaning of a word for you . 
  ( dictionaries are by and large explanatory , i would say , rather than authoritative , recording the prevalent meanings of a word at a given time , not trying to impose or restrict future developments )  because you seem to hold a de facto approach to linguistic syntax i thought you would appreciate this concept . 
  sorry for the technicality , but : we 're not debating syntax ( sentence structure ) , but semantics ( meaning of words ) and orthography ( proper spelling ) , the second being a slight deviation from the original topic into the the area of spelling competitions . 
   morally outraged ? 
  morally ? 
  why ? 
   the discussions in this post have led me to believe that people will say anything to justify sounding like an idiot . 
  now people who use idioms in a novel or unfamiliar way \u201e sound like idiots '' ? 
  why did you delete the rest of your comments ? 
  by comparison , parliamentary election turnouts : * 39.2 % in 2008 * 41.7 % in 2012, 
  they seem more displeased with individual members states , than the eu as a whole , imo . 
   there exist dictionaries and grammatical rulebooks that serve as our recognized guides and ensure mutual intelligibility for english speakers and writers . 
  dictionaries record usage , not define meaning . 
  out of curiosity , hoe do you feel about the second definition [ of this word ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally ) ? 
   out of curiosity , which version of `` i could ( n't ) care less '' would you use in a job interview ? 
  i would use the context-appropriate one . 
  being a setting where [ high prestige dialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prestige_%28sociolinguistics%29 ) is favored , i would use the more widespread/more prestigious form of `` could n't care less '' . 
  just like i would n't show up in flip-flops ( are flip-flops wrong ? ) . 
  but we 're on reddit , and not on a job-interview , so less prestigious forms are equally valid . 
  just because something is frowned upon in one context does n't mean it 's `` wrong '' . 
  sex in public is wrong , but that does n't mean sex is wrong in all contexts . 
    between british english spelling or american english spelling , which one is right ? 
   both are recognized as correct where spoken do n't worry . 
  `` could care less '' will be recognized as well . 
  also , a languages is more than just the `` standard version '' which you like to equate with `` right version '' . 
  the point is that there is not linguistic criteria that differentiates right usage from wrong . 
  unconventional does not equal wrong . 
  restricted usage does not equal wrong . 
  just as a curiosity : between british english spelling or american english spelling , which one is right ?
