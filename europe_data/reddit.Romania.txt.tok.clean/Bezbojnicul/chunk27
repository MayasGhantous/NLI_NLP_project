  objectively ? 
   if people can no longer understand what you mean , then you may as well be speaking gobbledygook as english . 
  speaking about brits and their native language : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugugzh3ne5w, 
  except by you , 2 comments above . 
  your point being ? 
  not all english words are used the same way by all anglophones , ya know . 
  just because you use a word differently does n't make it wrong . 
  it 's just that the respective use is restricted , i assume , to 1 person ( yourself ) . 
  `` could care less '' is widely used otoh . 
   i am a native english speaker . 
   because he said it wrong there is no `` wrong '' . 
   as a native english speaker who has a pretty decent educational level ** in the subject ** , i 'm trying to tell you that it is incorrect would `` this subject '' be linguistics ? 
  being a native speaker of english does n't make you an expert in linguistics any more than having a pulse makes you a cardiologist . 
   this list of reasons for grammatical disputes gives a good summary even better summary : `` correctness '' is entirely subjective . 
   i did have to stop for a moment to think what he meant because it was n't entirely clear from context that still does n't make his expression incorrect . 
  it makes you confused by an expression that many other natives and non-natives find perfectly clear . 
  ~ ~ such is life when it comes to foreign languages , one sometimes gets confused . ~ ~, 
  low turnout is less about corruption and more about feeling that eu elections are unimportant/the ep is far away . 
   incorrect application who decides what is correct and what is `` incorrect applications '' ( in the english language ) ? 
  on what basis ? 
  try / r/askeurope as well . 
  might get more answers . 
  ** romania ** * social-democrats team up with hungarian party for a new majority , after liberals leave coalition . 
  there 's been a lot of talk about the constitutionality of the move given that they changed partners but submitted virtually the same `` program to govern '' . 
  they later [ ammended the program to be more up to date ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-s-president-endorses-new-government ) . 
  * following above split , liberal leader [ resigns from post as senate president ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zjdmu/romania_senate_president_crin_antonescu_resigns/ ) * on monday the appeals court [ handed down harsh prison sentences ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zmdj3/romania_jails_corrupt_football_officials/ ) to eight senior executives and management figures found guilty of irregularities in the transfer of football players abroad . 
  beside the years of prison [ detailed here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zixzk/romanian_football_heads_given_final_sentence_to/ ) they also had to pay back big sums of money to the state . 
  a lot of people , including politicians have called for the pardoning of gheorghe popescu , because , you know , if you are a legendary football player , you should n't be so harshly judged / you 're a victim of circumstance . 
  this was the biggest news of the week . 
  * president says [ romania wants to be part of negotiation format over ukraine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zrr34/romania_wants_to_be_part_of_negotiation_format/ ) , and is sending observers to the former soviet republic as part of an osce mission . 
  * [ vidin-calafat bridge increases bulgaria-romania trade volume ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zu1dg/danube_bridge_2_increased_bulgaria_romania_trade/ ) ** ps ** a fresh one : * some polish dude threatened the driver ( s ) of a shuttle bus traveling the route amsterdam-bucharest , wounding them . 
  actually , it 's an azerbaijani invasion that the armenians fear ... 
  afaik \u201e new europe '' is the official name , but your link says both are . 
  i share your pain . 
  yeah . 
  we 're more or less in the same situation as slovakia ( see above/below ) . 
  tbh everybody calls it the \u201e vidin-calafat bridge '' . 
   while no russian official had ever bothered to visit crimean tatars before , moscow was now sending one delegation after another . 
  `` this sudden brotherly love is overwhelming , '' he joked . 
  ouch !, 
  or a [ tamga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamga#turkic_peoples ), 
  that 's fuckin ' determination ... 
   in romania is the head of the civil service a political position ? 
  there is no unified civil service in romania , for it to have a `` head '' afaik . 
   the head of the european commission has a role more akin to the head of the uk civil service than the the uk prime minister . 
  it 's more akin to the civil service since it started to become political and democratically accountable . 
  when it functioned like a civil service people were bitching it 's more akin to the prime-minister , yet it has no democratic accountability . 
  give me a fuckin ' break . 
   but british officials are uneasy with the notion that the selection of the next head of the european commission should be linked to the results of the european parliament elections . 
  downing street is n't alone in thinking that `` the whole procedure is an idiotic idea , '' as one senior british official said last week . 
  are they for real ? 
  have n't they been bitching about `` democratic deficits '' ? 
  now they want `` consensus '' ? 
  how would you like this statement then :  but welsh officials are uneasy with the notion that the selection of the next head of the british government should be linked to the results of the uk parliament elections . 
   a ) crimea is 58 % ethnic russian . 
  that 's 2001 census data . 
  it 's 60.2 % if one ads sevastopol as well . 
  * ( i was curios and i did the math using the 2001 data ) *, 
   in one of them , it looks like russia is taking control of a chunk of country , in the other it looks like they 're taking control of an island . 
  and an island is not \u201e a chunk of country '' ? 
   i 've been following the bbc 's version of events maybe he would have noticed that bbc has [ various maps of crimea ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73340000/gif/_73340561_ukraine_gas_pipelines_624_v3.gif ) , including [ some that show the sivash ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73363000/gif/_73363841_ukraine_crimea_russia_map3_624.gif ) ( the shallow [ body of water that separates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sivash ) mainland ukraine from the peninsula ) . 
  map sources : [ article from march 4 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26418664 ) and one [ from march 6 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26461426 ) . 
   do n't forget that khrushchev gifted crimea to ukraine less than 30 years ago . 
  til 1954 was less than 30 years ago . 
  this could just be \u201e hypothetical russia '' map . 
  you know ... \u201e this is what russia will look like if the ~ ~ annexation ~ ~ union goes trough '' . 
   where did you come up with this numbers ? 
  memory . 
  but i googled it now , and [ found i was n't off ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-16104519-sondaj-ires-trei-sferturi-dintre-romani-declara-acord-unirea-romaniei-republica-moldova.htm ) :  three quarters ( 76 % ) of romanians agrees with the unification of moldova with romania  64 % of respondents had heard about basescu 's statements according to which `` romania 's next political project after nato and the eu , should be the union with the republic of moldova ''  63 % of survey participants had good and very good opinions about this statement , while 20 % had bad and very bad opinions . 
  typical american news channel !, 
  very improbable . 
  according to latest polls only 15 % of moldovans want unification . 
  also , although 75 % of romanians want unification , i think it 's mostly `` in principle '' . 
  many people say they want to unite eventually , but are n't too keen on footing the bill at the moment . 
  roman khudiakov is as relevant to state policy as sarah palin is to us foreign policy . 
  generalizing from one clown just makes you loose credibility in the end . 
   but take into account that their president is a weirdo too . 
  and so is the mayor of reykjavik . 
  would you put him in the same category too ? 
   deputy from the liberal democratic party not to mention that the [ liberal democratic party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ldpr_%28political_party%29 ) is vladimir zhirinovsky 's ultranationalist party . 
   ** russia 's state duma wants independence for transnistria **  russian state duma deputy from the liberal democratic party , authorized representative for international relations roman khudiakov , sent a letter to the russian foreign ministry to recognize transnistria as an independent state is equivallent to saying  ** greek parliament wants expulsion of all foreigners from greece **  greek mp from the golden dawn party , authorized representative for international relations roman khudiakopoulos , sent a letter to the greek interior ministry to [ asking ] for all foreigners to be kicked out of greece . 
  one letter from a weirdo does not state policy make . 
  also this is an editorialized submission of an article which already has a highly sensationalistic and misleading title . 
  i highly discourage such submissions . 
   by having the russian parliament ( probably ) recognise transnistria . 
  if you are referring to the current # 1 post on / r/europe , than it 's noot the `` state duma '' but only one deputy from the state duma that is n't even in the ruling party ( he 's from the ultranationalists ) . 
  oh , you 're right . 
  my brain ignored the second part of the title . 
  ~ ~ actually , it was ukrinform.ua who editorialized the title , not op . ~ ~, 
  actually , this particular becali ( gigi ) is already in jail , and the becalis convicted just now ( ioan & victor ) are his cousins . 
   or 6th of janury if you 're orthodox . 
  depends on the orthodox church . 
  your orthodox are probably rusyn/ukrainian , but romanians , bulgarians , greeks and albanians celebrate western style ( 24th/25th ) . 
  his italian and french are really good !, 
  best comeback yet . 
   ofcourse they will accept it they wont accept a referendum taken under military occupation , especially since it 's unconstitutional to secede , unless the whole of ukraine approves by referendum . 
  i think the aim is to tie a big anvil to ukraine 's ankle via a `` separatist region '' , same as with moldova and georgia . 
   so , they have accepted putin taking crimea . 
  they have n't accepted formally , but they know it ai n't coming back under kiev 's control any time soon ( if ever ) . 
  it 's like asking `` do you accept that your stollen phone is now the rightfull property of the thief ? '' .
