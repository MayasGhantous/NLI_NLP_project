  of course you do n't accept , but you also know that the phone is gone , and it ai n't coming back . 
   will they feel betrayed by the us and eu ? 
  no , they wo n't . 
  unless the us and the eu accept formally that putin is right . 
  which they wo n't do . 
   i do n't see how putin is n't winning in that scenario . 
  who said he is n't ? 
  the endgame now is to prevent him invading the rest of ukraine . 
  crimea is lost , and the west knows it , but they ca n't come out and just say it . 
   if us and the eu let putin keep crimea they wo n't accept putin taking crimea , but they wont go and kick him out either . 
  we 'll just end up with another frozen conflict a la transnistria .

  gulag jokes aside : 1 . 
  [ green ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_ukraine ) - a historical ukrainian name of the land in the russian far east area between the amur river and the pacific ocean . 
  [ ... ] it was named by the ukrainian settlers . 
  the territory consists of over 1,000,000 square kilometres and has a population of 3.1 million ( 1958 ) . 
  the ukrainian population in 1897 made up 15 % of the primorskaya oblast 's population .

   a better question is , why does the hungarian alphabet contain q , w , x and y ? 
  those denote no phoneme at all , and are merely included for historical reasons . 
  they are probably also useful for foreign words up until they get hungarianized . 
  at least that 's mostly why romanian has q , w and y. 
   i doubt there are many people considering `` ng '' to be a different letter too  they do in welsh and korean , for example . 
   that 's a great question , and i think / u/bezbojnicul might be more fit to answer , if i recall correctly he 's a linguist thanks for the credit , but i 'm just an amateur in this field . 
  for a professional answer i really suggest asking the fine folks from / r/linguistics . 
  they are actual linguists , with actual degrees ( other than wikipedia uni , like myself )  now , speculating a bit , i think they are listed as `` separate letters '' because they show separate [ phonemes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonemes ) . 
  also looking at the wikiarticle for [ digraphs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digraph_\\ ( orthography \\ ) )  a digraph or digram is a pair of characters used to write one phoneme ( distinct sound ) or a sequence of phonemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined . 
  the sound is often , but not necessarily , one which can not be expressed using a single character in the orthography used by the language . 
   so tge solution to european integration is russian aggression !, 
  who knew ? 
  eastern europe . 
   i remember being in holiday like 1 year before they introduced the euro . 
  fyi bulgaria has n't switched to the euro yet . 
  yes : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_sisters_%28moscow%29, 
   will do . 
  now i have to learn how to make that thin line like / u/meidei does between topics . 
  three dashes - \\ -- gets you -- ta-da !, 
   if you can read hungarian , read this , it 's golden . 
  going by the image , clicking on that video was one risky click . 
  good thing copyright law saved me ( video not available in my country ) . 
  anyway , just reading your description made me tear up from laughter . 
   our qualification will mostly depend on the games against romania , a long-standing rival of ours . 
  i can already see the nationalist incidents overhyped by our medias . 
  ** romania ** * [ the liberals quit the ruling coalition ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-s-ruling-coalition-breaks-up ) .

  this and the situation in ukraine dominated the news this week .

  no , i 'm saying that stalin 's deportations are n't the primary reason crimean tatars are a minority in crimea , as suggested in the comment above . 
  about 20k , composed of russian old-believers ( [ lipovans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) ) . 
  we have us military presence , as well as nato membership ( unlike ukraine ) 2 . 
  our russian minority ( about 20k ) is composed of russian old-believers ( [ lipovans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) ) . 
  useless to putin . 
  that being said , he can fuck up moldova , which we care deeply about . 
  so he can screw us indirectly , sort of . 
  also he 's sending a message . 
  no they wo n't . 
  ukraine is not in nato , baltics are . 
  whole different ballgame . 
   if i were a baltic state , i would also feel uneasy about russia invading a former soviet republic in eastern europe . 
  trust me , the whole of eastern europe is feeling uneasy , not just former soviet republics . 
  he 's got so many columns in crimea he could build a replica of the parthenon . 
   hungarian slovaks do n't want to join hungary and south tyrol mostly does n't want to join austria any data to back this up ? 
   i don \u00b4 t think it is in putins interest to see crimea secede . 
  agreed . 
  a transnistria type scenario ( unrecognized secessionist state ) is much more useful to russia . 
  crimean tatars have n't been a majority since the late 19th century https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea#ethnic_groups, 
  to be fair , they were n't a majority before the deportations either . 
   it 's seems to be the same situation . 
  how so ? 
  i do n't think the crimean russians are repressed in the way kosovar albanians were in the 90s so as to justify secession . 
  nobody tried to undo the crimean autonomy , nobody barred russians from any post , and the repealing of the language law is hardly comparable to the discrimination of albanians in kosovo . 
  so you guys made a [ m\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or ] ( http://mpnewyork.mae.ro/en/romania-news/375 ) out of it ... 
   if turkish troops stay in northern cyprus it should all be ok . 
  yeah , just like the russian troops in transnistria make it ok for the rest of moldova . 
  it was a stupid move symbolically to begin with . 
  the law might be badly written , but the symbolic weight of repealing a law regarding minority languages as one of the first things in office was huge ( and is especially bothersome in the current context ) . 
  waiting a bit until a new law was written should have been the way to go . 
  good thing the new president has some brains . 
   but do n't romania and moldova both have a pretty strong unification movement according to latest polls , the number of moldovans wanting unification with romania is around 15 % . 
  not de jure . 
   palacsinta is slavic latin , via [ romanian ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pl%c4%83cint%c4%83 ) actually . 
  yep . 
  it was n't given . 
  after the communist revolution of 1917 , bessarabia said `` fuck it '' declared independence and then chose to unite with romania in 1918 . 
  by the time of this treaty , union with romania was already a done deal . 
  see [ wikiarticle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_bessarabia_with_romania#moldavian_democratic_republic ) .

  fl\u00f3dni is the only one i have n't heard of until now . 
  the others are seen ( here in western romania ) as either \u201e hungarian from hungary '' , \u201e local hungarian '' , \u201e just local ( non-ethnic ) '' or \u201e just generally food '' ( especially [ t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt k\u00e1poszta ] ( http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/romanianmaincourses/r/stuffed-cabbage-sarmale.htm ) ) . 
   which is pretty much the same , is n't it ?
