  so every historian that explained the rise of nazism in post-wwi germany is basically a far-right apologist ? 
   just went with the cheap joke call it '' [ ancien r\u00e9gime royal standard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_flag#ancien_r.c3.a9gime_in_france ) '' . 
  cheap joke upgraded to sophisticated vexilollogy joke . 
  apparently , russian boxing champion nikolai valuev came to sevastopol , and he claims to `` support crimean citizens '' . 
  -- kgb bigshot : `` what ? 
  the ukrainians ousted our man in kiev ? 
  kgb lower rank : `` well sir , they do have that boxer fellow . '', 
  kgb bigshot : `` well we have a boxer too . 
  deploy valuev in crimea !, 
  muhahhahahaaaa !!! '', 
  let 's name this shot `` protasiewicz '', 
  get this to / r/vexillology and / r/estonianflags asap !, 
  also keep in mind that some russian-speakers are ethnic russians , but others self-identify as ethnic ukrainians . 
   creating similar situation for eastern ukraine would n't be stable i think not all of eastern ukraine . 
  i was thinking only about crimea . 
   breaking up ukraine in two probably seems the best one to him at the moment . 
  i do n't think he wants to break up ukraine , as much as he wants to create a `` transnistria-type scenario '' in crimea , to blackmail kiev with for a couple of decades , and ensure it stays out of the eu . 
  here in romania , the authorities usually take the millitary hardware out for ~ ~ a spin ~ ~ [ a parade ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=parada+1+decembrie&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=epc&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=sb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=uu8ou5wyjc_bsgatzoggca&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=885 ) each december 1 ^ st ( our national day ) . 
  other than that , you do n't see much of it anywhere . 
  i 'm guessing this is because of the military importance of the naval base there . 
  how come sevastopol is a separate region ? 
   a monument to people who gave their lives for liberation of europe . 
  eastern europe did n't feel very liberated for another 4 and a half decades tbh . 
   they made a statue of ronald reagan walking towards the soviet monument that 's a very interesting way to re-contextualize the soviet monument . 
  live now : [ ep transmission on ukraine ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/europe-26346761 ), 
   the other big problem is how many councils europe has indeed . 
  half of european institutions can be abreviated `` ec '' . 
   germany ( which gets 99 ) is n't it 96 ? 
  agreed . 
  all these presidents just confuse the fuck out of everything . 
  and speaking of confusing , some punctuation in your comments would do wonders for you , 
  in romania , the central bank 's big kahuna is called the `` governor of the central bank '' . 
  chairman could also work . 
  does this apply for the federal elections as well , or just the european ones ? 
  if just the european ones , why are the two scenarios treated differently ? 
  what about a 5 % hurdle , like in the federal elections ? 
  * head-comissioner / chief-comissioner * speaker of parliament * council president / president of the european council ( as is today ) * ?? 
  yes , and van rompuy is for all intents and purposes `` the president '' here . 
   i 'm assuming it will be in english maybe the actual debate part will be in english and the opening + closing statement parts will be in the native language . 
  or vice-versa . 
  who know . 
  yay , debate !, 
   my understanding is that most moldovans can obtain romanian citizenship by right . 
  yes , everybody who is descended from former romanian citizens . 
  soviet people who migrated to moldova post-ww2 can not obtain it though . 
   a large part of the ossetians thought of themselves as russian i doubt it they tought/think of themselves as russians . 
  they thought/think of themselves as ossetians , and wanted unification with the ossetians living in north ossetia ( part of russia ) . 
   where 's our snoo ? 
  i 'm still in the process of compiling a list of national days of european countries , and it 's proving a bit more difficult that i first thought . 
  but i 'll make a snoo tonight , if that 's ok . 
  all of them have some form of proportional , some countries just chose to break up the national territory into smaller constituencies . 
  not sure why though . 
   like zis [ res friendly ( png ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/ep-constituencies.svg/1000px-ep-constituencies.svg.png ), 
   i do n't think we have registration to vote in romania . 
  we do n't . 
  where resident registration ( government database containing information on the current residence of persons ) is in effect ( like romania ) , voter registration is generally not required . 
   edit : i just have read wikipedia . 
  croatia has 12 mps for 2014 , the argument is non-existing . 
  which wikiarticle ? 
  [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014#constitutional_issues ) indicates that croatia , ireland and lithuania will all have 11 meps . 
  i think it was some jaded austrian artist who used it ... 
   if they were constitutional you get the same constitution as before ... no , not really . 
   the law was unfair towards ukrainian language how so ? 
   it is democratic : people want it , power does it . 
  democracy is more than just mob rule . 
   when they want to live in ukraine . 
  and if they do n't , can the romanian areas secede ? 
  you do realize that the fact that romanians live in ukraine was decided by ribbentrop and molotov , and enforced via tanks ? 
  it 's not like the romanians in chernovitsi oblast had a referendum and decided they want ukraine over romania . 
  ** romania ** * feuding among the social democrats and liberals [ in romania 's ruling coalition intensifies ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ruling-coalition-in-romania-on-verge-of-breaking-up ) , predictions grow that the coalition may collapse at any moment . 
  it was to be expected ... * romania 's version of cevapcici , called `` mici '' , [ is exempted from certain eu directives ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-hails-salvation-of-cherished-sausages ) . 
  sodium carbonate is our `` special ingredient '' and its use in mici was under threat . 
  now the national dish/snack is safe once more . 
  * romania 's constitutional court has [ struck down a draft proposal for adopting a new constitution ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romanian-court-rejects-draft-of-revised-constitution ) , saying it 's got a lot of unconstitutional articles . 
  back to the drawing board ... * euthanasia of stray dogs that did n't get adopted [ has started ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/romania-authorities-kill-over-180-street-dogs/2014/02/20/90e88fc2-9a4b-11e3-9900-dd917233cf9c_story.html ) . 
  it might not sound important , but the debate around this subject has been crazy . 
  * remember the teacher i told you about who [ was filmed aggressively demanding gifts from parents ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1v0yln/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cenvm35 ) and was subsequently fired ? 
  she is now suing the school for firing her . 
  * the new york times made a short documentary about the woman who dubbed all the bootleged moves in 80 's romania . 
  [ `` vhs vs. 
  communism '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000002708995/vhs-vs-communism.html ), 
  there is also the issue that europositive people of europe would be more interested in a sub named / r/europe than euronegative people , who might just stick to their own national subs . 
   so , the political opinions of r/europe are not the opinions of europe . 
  that 's not what he said . 
  he said thaat  this sub-reddit reflects the democratic opinion of the ** european reddit community on reddit ** * ( i.e. 
  majority of young european redditors ) * not  this sub-reddit reflects the democratic opinion of the european population irl * ( majority of europeans ) *, 
  while i dissagree that `` almost any opinion that has any negative remarks regarding the eu will be down-voted to hell '' , i do agree that sometimes votes on comments seem to be influenced by their content , not by their quality . 
  so i 'm going to take the opportunity to remind users of this sub about the rules of [ rediquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) regarding voting :  ** please do **  vote . 
  if you think something contributes to conversation , upvote it . 
  if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . 
   ** please do n't **  downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you do n't personally like it . 
  think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you 're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion . 
  if you simply take a moment to stop , think and examine your reasons for downvoting , rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction , you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons . 
   think of it as a `` one-time offer because you guys are special '' thing . 
  well , the catalans are sort of special as well . 
    ... and i promised to myself i would n't comment on this thread ... tbh , i find this conversation very informative . 
   checks history  ah op only submits anti immigration stuff and stuff that paints muslims in a bad light . 
  removed . 
  should have checked his comment history . 
   if you open that door for catalonia some other regions might want to have their slice of pie too does n't that risk already exist since euskadi and navarra already have `` special fiscal status '' ?
