   a place that has no identity , globalization slowly destroys all the traditions i never really understood this point . 
  could you expand upon what \u201e place with no identity '' means , what , in your opinion , should \u201e the west '' do to regain an identity ?

   wake up , wake up , father , ( x2 )  the drum is beating , ( x2 )  they 're coming for my sister , ( x2 ) -  the most beautiful one ,  the most beautiful one , father ,  the smallest one . 
  -  wake up , wake up , father ,  the dowry is being taken out , ( x2 )  the smallest one .

  the video was more dramatic than i expected ,

  \u201e northern hungary '' ? 
  * braces for impact *, 
   in romanian the [ ... ] official plural of euro is also euro , and this official form was readily adopted by speakers . 
  the `` eu '' construct is not a diphthong , thus the pronunciation is [ \u02c8e.uro ] . 
   when speaking in a familiar -- vernacular setting , some speakers would make the informal plural `` euroi '' ( not seen as academic , and not used officially ; i 've also heard the form `` oiro '' which mimics the german pronounciation , and is a very colloquial-joke form . 
  [ indeed ] ( https://38.media.tumblr.com/98bcdedb4cb789ff526ccb81a23f633f/tumblr_n6zbgfrchd1tsxieqo1_500.gif ), 
   this is a common stupidity that you 'll hear many romanians repeat . 
  i 'm with you on this one ... 
  if you 're interested , an architecture magazine took a more scientific approach to the phenomenon , and published a study on roma palaces from romania . 
  link : [ igloo ] ( http://www.igloo.ro/en/books/kastello/ ) or [ amazon ] ( http://www.amazon.com/kastello-rromilor-romania-romanian-edition/dp/9738840449/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1413711204&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kastello+igloo ), 
  we also used to refer to yugoslavia as `` the serbs '' and the ussr as `` the russians '' . 
  maybe ebola is what we need to fix the eu 's democratic deficit ... / s, 
   technically i never understood why are the kosovo albanians offended by calling them \u0160iptari , since it 's their own word for their own people . 
  any word can aquire negativ connotations if used by an out-group while still being acceptable within the in-group ( think about blacks using \u201e nigga '' between each other and a white dude using it on a black man , in the us ) . 
  if \u201e deutch '' is used by english speakers in a negative context against germans , they might start insisting that english speakers call them \u201e german '' and nothing else , while deutsch still being used between themselves in german . 
   good thing our politicians are more scared of the eu than of the church , though . 
  yeah . 
  being gray keeps the status quo , and everybody is happy . 
  eu is happy because we do n't ban , church is happy ( well , not pissed ) that it 's still banned by normal law . 
  politicians are happy because they can save face . 
   i 'm pretty sure doctors are statistically more likely to be smokers as well . 
  http://www.zi-de-zi.ro/universitatea-de-medicina-si-farmacie-e-libera-de-fumat/  * `` statistics show that the prevalence of smoking in the medical corps and staff in this part of europe , perhaps starting from italy up to central and eastern europe , is higher than that of the general population . 
  for example , the prevalence of smoking in our country [ romania ] is 36 % in the general population and 43 % in the medical corp , some areas having an even higher prevalence . [ ... 
  ] '' * said prof. dr. kikeli istvan pal also , i heard heavy drinking is pretty standard with surgeons . 
   is by taking literally some pretty arbitrary and lazy definitions of what constitutes `` europe '' . 
  well , the eastern boundary of europe is the most arbitrary of them all tbh . 
   interesting that hungarians are pretty much southern finns . 
  that is as accurate as saying poles are `` eastern celts '' or `` northern iranians '' . 
   the traditional way is that the ural mountains is the border which means a small part of kazakhstan is in europe . 
  actually , i learned it as * `` ural mountains - [ ural river ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural_river ) - etc. 
  '' * given that there is a gap between the ural mts . 
  and the caspian . 
  yeah , i like it too , 
  there is ( was ) and entire cathegory of roma whose occupation was \u201e bear trainer '' such as the ones above . 
  there is a quite well written wikipedia article avout them : * [ ursari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ursari ) today , the practice of bear-handling wanderers has been stamped out , but captive bears around tourist spots were still a problem until recently . 
  fortunately there is bear sanctuary at z\u0103rne\u0219ti which does an awesome job taking care of captive bears . 
  some of the stories there are heartbreaking though ( had a friend visit recently ) . 
  * [ natgeo link ] ( http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/19/a-visit-to-the-bear-sanctuary/ ) about the sanctuary . 
   indeed , if you feel that decisions should be taken locally well , independence would keep eu decisions at eu level , but would move `` national '' decisions from madrid to barcelona , so in a sense , there would be more decisions taken locally than atm . 
  i think of it as eliminating a middleman . 
  a catholic german population colonized in various parts of the former habsburg empire in the 17th-18th centuries . 
  they are a different population from the transylvania saxons who were colonized in the 13th-14th centuries in southern transylvania by the kingdom of hungary , and who subsequently became lutheran during the reformation . 
  iohannis is a saxon . 
  and the western fringe has a blooming neo-protestant population like baptists , pentecostals and other evangelicals ( although it 's spreading to other areas as well ) . 
  they might be small as a percentage , but they have many members from among the political class . 
  just sayin ', 
   guly\u00e1s is cow herder til, 
  do n't make it personal . 
  i doubt / u/vernazza was at the game . 
  i agree with everything you said except :  iohannis is a local catholic schwab he 's lutheran saxon . 
  ( the schwabs live in banat and satu mare area ), 
  ** romania ** * election campaign * - ruling party senator and pm 's election campaign spokesperson attacks presidential candidate iohannis for not having children , and when it came to light that the couple could n't , she said they should have adopted .

  that 's what i meant . 
  i wonder if romanian names that end in \u201e - ean '' ( quite common , pronounced virtually the same as \u201e - ian '' ) would get problems at the border ... 
  i 've read that they block your entry even if you have an armenian name . 
  [ see here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_romanian_citizens ) ( ctrl + f \u201e azer '' ), 
   so , we may not agree with policies of russia but have to work with them many people in eastern europe feel the same about the us . 
  some segments of the population dislike various aspects of america ( foreign policy , liberalism , whatever ) but are very pro-us and nato because they need them geopolitically ( protection from russia ) . 
  so few people here will judge your alliance with russia . 
  a friend of mine who wanted to visit the 3 countries in the southern caucasus next summer was really bummed out when i told him that visiting armenia means he ca n't visit azerbaidjan . 
  screwed up his plans a bit ... 
   leaving them to trade with iran , which borders the country in the south east and georgia . 
   but russia has taken care of them by providing security , this is the crux of the issue . 
  russia can provide security . 
  eu can not ( unfortunately ) . 
  actually , the eu needs a azerbadjan as a gateway to central asia to bypass russia . 
   maybe the european uniom should have given them an offer they could not have refused , though . 
  sadly , the eu can not guaranty security to armenia . 
  geopolitically speaking , russia is the best bet , and everybody ( eu , russia , armenia ) knows it . 
  yes , but the title is a direct quote from the article . 
  i did n't change yerevan to erevan , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  x-post to / r/vexillology as well , 
  if things get too stable , we start feeling uneasy round these parts ... 
  thank you , 
  reminds me of this [ thing i made ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7hwpwlh.png ) some time ago ... 
  it is de jure secular . 
  it has separation of church and state ( dat amendment ) , even if a lot of people and a lot of politicians hold strong religious views . 
  the us has no state religion , ergo , it is secular . 
  * edit : * according to the definitions found [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secularism ) , the us is secular by definition 1 , and not secular by definition 2 .
