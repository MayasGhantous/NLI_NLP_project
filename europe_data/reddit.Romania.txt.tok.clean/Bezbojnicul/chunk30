  it 's already a `` discriminatory '' situation , so to speak . 
  i linked the wiki above , which gives the figures from the 2011 census : 82.1 % gagauz 4.8 % moldovans/romanians 13.1 % other minorities so while ~ 1/5 are n't gagauz , minorities tend to be pro-russia , just like the gagauz majority . 
   actually catalonia got offered the same fiscal pact euskadi and navarra have back in the 70s and they turned it down would they turn it down now ? 
  i do n't see any reason not to offer it again . 
  i mean , opinions can change a lot in 40 years . 
   they did not vote against him , though , and they could have . 
  care to expand ? 
  i 'm curious about this . 
  i do n't understand your sentence tbh . 
  specifically :  from another where 30 % of your population represent a majority . 
   i reckon if spain had given us the rights that navarra and euskadi have , this probably would n't be happening . 
  i pretty sure that would have taken a lot of energy out of the independist movement . 
  i really really do n't understand why they did n't give those same rights to catalonia as well . 
  the news was covered in last [ sunday 's news thread as well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1y1w4w/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cfgnna8 ) :  a morrocan immigrant received a lot of death-threats from the muslim community after opening a wine-bar . 
  they think that a muslim should n't serve alcohol . 
  everybody got involved to support her , even the major of rotterdam came to drink wine . 
  and now people inside the morrocan communities have started initiatives to support her by coming to drink ( alcohol-free halal ) wine in her wine-bar . 
  your comment is a `` three paragraph carnival of lacrimsteinism '' ^ i ^ agree ^ btw, 
   it 's like romania but without gypsies .

   the actual `` dish '' as it is known today originated in bucharest in the early 20th century as a modified patrician afaik that is a ( very popular ) urban myth .

   checking what the swiss people want before beginning negotiations strikes me as exactly the right way to do things . 
  to be fair , this was n't a government-initiated consultation , preceding an announced negotiation , but a public initiative that forces the government to go negotiate with the eu . 
  you make it sound as if the swiss gov ' t had already booked negotiation before the referendum . 
  those 2 discussions should be intimately connected , as further integration should be accompanied by reform . 
  it 's not about monopoly . 
  there are 3 heavyweights in the eu , but only 2 are are meeting to plan \u201e the eu 's revival '' . 
  i do n't like the uk being absent is a good thing . 
  it means more separation between the uk and the \u201e continent '' on eu matters . 
  sure , in an ideal world , all 28 eu members would be on equal footing , and policy would be promoted based on merit , but it 's not an ideal world , and some countries have more weight in this game . 
  the uk should be there too . 
  frence-germany-uk should be the core of europe imo . 
   it should say < 10 , and  30 it should say '' < 10 '' , but `` 30 < '' is correct imo .
