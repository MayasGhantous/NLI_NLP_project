  a british woman , painted by a jewish painter , symbolizing romania . 
   also a favourite of mine : [ jew with goose ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/nicolae_grigorescu_026.jpg ) by n. grigorescu . 
  but all of grigorescu 's portraits are awesome !, 
  i 've never seen this painting before , but it 's very cool !, 
   lots of ethnic romanians were themselves slaves in some parts of the country at that time source ? 
   they had ** hundreds ** of years to do that speaking for parts of romania , it 's pretty hard to integrate when you 're a slave ( which they were up until the ~ 1860 's ), 
  you 're generally right but  where you have a chance to integrate given there are many integrated and assimilated roma in romania , i 'd say they have a chance to integrate here as well . 
  while there is hate and discrimination in romania , there is also state-sponsored affirmative action ( extra places reserved for the roma minority in schools and colleges , for example ) . 
  i wonder how much impact eu funds have on agricultural development . 
  there 's a lot of talk about agriculture and eu funds and so on . 
  relevant : http://vimeo.com/20395928 ( i heard the documentary is really good , but i have n't seen it yet ), 
  roma and romany are both endonyms . 
  gypsy and tsigan are exonyms . 
   yet , i have to cross the street when a group of gypsies come my way . 
  you know , i 've seen plenty of gypsies in tg.-mure \u015f and s\u00e2ngeorgiu de mure\u015f ( where my grandparents live , and where i used to spend all my vacations ) and a bit less so in oradea ( where i live ) , but the only place i really felt threatened by gypsies was in sighi\u015foara , coming down from a camping that was on a hill . 
  between the camping and the town there was a gypsy ghetto , where the youths seemed like they were looking for trouble . 
   the football team actually has one natural blond i noticed  just as a curiosity , where is your family from ? 
  the general area . 
  i wonder how many of them have dyed hair ? 
   for comparison , i googled [ the men 's footbal team ] ( http://cdncms.todayszaman.com/todayszaman/2013/10/17/turkey1.jpg ) . 
  way fewer blondes there . 
  another thing that came to mind : i 've noticed there are plenty of fair-skinned and green/blue-eyed people in the levant as well ( syria ) , and also in areas of afghanistan . 
  but these `` who is white '' things also factor in facial features for example . 
  i have seen blonde roma in my home city , but because their facial features are very south asian , they would never be classified as `` white '' . 
  anyway , as i 've said , shit 's subjective as fuck . 
  do the opposite mental exercise : as you move north in africa , where does `` black '' end ? 
  as you move west , where does `` asian '' end ? 
  there is no objective place on the spectrum where people stop being white . 
  as such , the limit between `` white '' and `` middle-eastern '' ( or `` brown '' or whatever ) is entirely arbitrary , and taken based on other factors than actual whiteness . 
  for example cultural and/or geographical border regions . 
  turks are mostly outside europe geographically , and muslim ( unlike most of europe , which is of christian heritage ) , so the turkish border is a convenient place to draw an arbitrary line between `` white '' and `` non-white '' . 
  also , compared to central-europeans , a lot of turks ( or so to say the `` stereotypical turk '' ) do look `` brownish '' . 
   funny how the perception of my racial colour changed according to the colour of the friend lol . 
  here 's [ a pic of 3 turks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cb615ce.jpg ) from my home city in western romania ( recent immigrants ) . 
  the guy on the left could not pass as a local romanian , but the guy in the middle could . 
  but this is my perspective as a romanian . 
  maybe people up north see both as `` non-white '' . 
  the point is that it 's subjective and pretty arbitrary . 
  i have seen a blond turk once who i could have sworn was from benelux or something until he opened his mouth . 
   many turks , possibly even most , are as white-looking as europeans depends which europeans . 
  turks probably blend in better in the balkans than in the baltics . 
  colleges usually have both tuition-free and with-tuition spots in university , the free ones being about 50 % or less of the total number of spots available . 
  as to the `` how '' , idk man . 
   it 's boring do n't worry . 
  i see a `` swiss obsession '' right around the corner ... 
   but if you watch that bbc documentary it shows how the nomadic roma are by and large involved in crime . 
  your first comment was n't about `` nomadic roma '' . 
  it was about all of them . 
  fyi , the overwhelming majority of roma are sedentary . 
  when you say '' [ gypsies ] are actually organised into a huge crime scheme '' , you are saying that every roma , with a couple of exceptions , is part of said of a criminal conspiracy . 
  it 's as silly as saying that every italian is involved in the mafia . 
   this is fact . 
  this is a documentary focusing on one criminal phenomenon , not a sociological study . 
   society albeit a small minority . 
  there are plenty of roma who contribute to society , as well as plenty who do n't . 
  guess which ones are more visible ? 
  site of the full archives : http://colectiacosticaacsinte.eu/, 
   the difference between comparing gypsies to other nationalities is that they are actually organised into a huge crime scheme . 
  the same way that italians are all part of the mafia . 
  i would n't either , but with a lack of immigrants , the ethnic minorities are the next closest thing to `` not dominant ethnicity '' one can find . 
  the [ romanian national team ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_national_football_team#current_squad ) is made up overwhelmingly of ethnic romanians from romania afaik . 
  the only people with minority roots seem to be : paul papp ( ethnic hungarian ) , claudiu keser\u00fc ( grandpa is hungarian ) , iasmin latovlevici and srdjan luchin ( ethnic serbs , i think ) and [ b\u0103nel nicoli\u021b\u0103 ] ( http://img.uefa.com/imgml/tp/players/14/2011/324x324/74186.jpg ) ( ethnic roma ) , and that 's as exotic as you 'll get . 
  fun fact : we did have high numbers of minorities in the national team [ in the 1920 's ] ( http://www.romaniansoccer.ro/national_team/games/1923.shtml ) ( hungarians , germans and jews from transylvania ) , even matches when there was no ethnic romanian playing . 
  `` santa has come '' is one from romania . 
  his statement according to the article :  `` i must say one crucial thing - many leading politicians are confused about the roma . 
  we can not talk about all the roma [ this way ] . 
  the ones we see walking around europe are the nomadic roma from romania and other eu countries . 
  their cultural objective is to move from place to place . 
  romania has over a million integrated roma that are part of romanian society . 
  where we failed is related to the integration of the nomadic roma . 
  here we have to ask ourselves , not only philosophically , but also the practical question of whether we are talking about integration or assimilation ? 
  banning their movement means to destroy one of the cultural pillars of the nomad roma ''  `` how could we do the for the children of nomadic roma ? 
  you will need to do it !, 
  we have a problem that needs to be told and which makes it difficult to integrate roma nomads - very few of them want to work . 
  many of them traditionally live from stealing . 
  unless we do not honestly acknowledge both the problems the ethnicity itself has , and the problems that we have in knowing the ethnicity , we can not find the solution to the problem . '', 
   he said that he used to be mayor and offered jobs to the roma that had settled on the outskirts of bucharest . 
   `` they did not like it and they went elsewhere . 
  of course , it was work in accordance with their training - at sanitation . 
  so the problem must be viewed in its entirety and if we limit ourselves only to talk about what we have to do but not what they must do , we will not solve the problem '' said basescu . 
  transylvanian romanians used to be split between orthodox and greek-catholic ( uniate ) up until ~ 1948 , but the rest of romanians were always orthodox . 
  there are also hungarians in transylvania which are split equally between roman-catholic and protestant ( calvinist ) , but they make up just one fifth of transylvania and 6 % of romania . 
  the way he phrased the 1 ^ st sentence makes it ambiguous . 
  the way i read it :  orthodox use cyrillic  catholic use latin  catholic slavic use latin with special marks, 
   orthodox ones used cyrillic . 
  except romania , moldova ( mostly ) , greece , cyprus and georgia . 
  well , can you expand , in your own words , what you mean by  all languages today tend to evolve towards a simpler , more lean and fast approach to transmitting information , so context becomes much more important in relaying information . 
  this is very apparent in english, 
   all languages today tend to evolve towards a simpler , more lean and fast approach to transmitting information , so context becomes much more important in relaying information . 
  do you happen to have a link to any academic paper that details this evolution ? 
  or could you give an example of what you mean ?
