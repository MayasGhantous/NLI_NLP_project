   they are mostly criminals living in `` camps '' of dirt and trash while they most likely have a higher than average crime rate , i doubt that * most * ( more than 50 % ) are criminals . 
  also , there are many integrated roma , that fly under the radar so to speak . 
  i 'm not aware of any interdiction . 
  it might be something that is not allowed for state institutions to some extent , but i know the soros foundation published research on [ unemployment and level of schooling among the roma ] ( http://www.soros.ro/?q=situa%c8%9bia-romilor-%c3%aen-2011-%c3%aentre-incluziune-social%c4%83-%c5%9fi-migra%c8%9bie ) . 
  so i think it 's allowed , at least for private institutions . 
  i ca n't say for crime rate , but i 'm pretty sure the level of incarceration is higher among the roma than the general public ( which is unsurprising given that poverty and lack of education correlate with higher crime-rate , especially in urban setting ) . 
  i 'll see what i can find on google . 
  i 'm not excusing anyone . 
  but there is a larger picture than just crime statistics . 
   edit : gypsies are gravely overrepresented in crime statistics here in sweden . 
  they are overrepresented in crime statistics in many central and south-eastern european countries as well . 
  they are also overrepresented in the poverty statistics , in the unemployment statistics , in the illiteracy and low-education statistics , and so on . 
   i wonder also whether you also consider germany , with its policy of granting citizenship to `` russlanddeutsche [ 3 ] '' , whose german ancestry is nearly as remote , and many of whom hardly speak any german , to also be a `` banana republic '' ( unlike spain , it is a republic , at least ) . 
  forget the russlanddeutsche . 
  how about the [ transylvania saxons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania_saxons ) ? 
  they 've been in what is now romania since the 13 ^ th century . 
  not many left though . 
   i 'm guessing it 's because during communism religion was forbidden and often times people were tortured or killed for practicing it it 's a bit more complex than that , and it varied from country to country ( eastern europe is more than just the soviet union ) and from period to period . 
  also , some denominations had it harder than others . 
   especially after the state has invested in them and their education . 
  the state should keep investing in them if it wants to keep them . 
  and the healthcare system in general . 
  just as a general curiosity , in what line of work are you active ? 
  it 's both the financial aspect ( low wages ) and the rottenness of the system ( corruption , lack of fucks given by elder medical staff ) .

  there is common history after the hungarian sttlement in the carpathian basin as well ( afaik there were some inside the early hungarian kingdom who wanted to go with the patriarch of constantinopole rather than the patriarch of rome ) . 
  for example the [ holy crown of hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szent_korona ) is clearly made in a byzantine style .

  maybe they do not want absolute sovereignty . 
  maybe they want to remove one administrative layer between themselves and bruxelles . 
   well as far as i 'm concerned on / r/europe [ 1 ] there has been general hostility towards scottish and catalan independence . 
  more so catalan independence . 
  the opinion here is hardly hostile towards scotland , and even for catalonia it 's still somewhat positive . 
  sure , it gets more comments and debate because it 's a one sided move ( unlike scotland ) , but the atmosphere is hardly hostile . 
   even the banner of / r/europe is basically the banner of the protest movement . 
  and that of the state itself . 
  just because the opposition uses the flag does not mean that flag is an exclusive symbol of the opposition ( as was/is the case in lybia or syria ),

  just found out from the subreddit-that-shan ` t-be-named that today is the [ sami national day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_national_day ) , and i used the opportunity to change the snoo .

  how is it relevant ? 
  just changed it . 
  it had the ukrainian flag and it said * `` hot topic du jour : ukraine '' *, 
  agreed . 
  \u201e [ i do n't get no respect ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ff67z3iiju ) '', 
  some factors at play : * nationalism is seen as anathema to `` european values '' * nationalism is associated with communism here , and we learned during the 80s ' ( and [ early 90s ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_quadrilateral ) ) that nationalism does n't protect you from hunger , and makes you [ look more like a clown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheorghe_funar ) . 
  * speaking of the 90 's , we got a taste of what happens when nationalism goes wild [ in 1990 , in t\u00e2rgu mure\u015f ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t%c3%a2rgu_mure%c8%99 ) . 
  as such , both the majority and the minority agreed that dialogue is the proffered way to go . 
  * as such , all `` conflict '' between majority and minority was dealt with through dialogue and political negotiations . 
  the [ hungarian minority party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmr ) has been a junior member of government , de facto or de jure , from 1996 to 2012 . 
  also each minority has one mp by default , so this ads another 18 ( iirc ) mps to parliament to voice concern if needed . 
  also , the greater romania party was effectively [ cordon sanitaire 'd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordon_sanitaire ) by the other parties . 
  * we have had a positive relationship with hungary , so that eased a lot of pressure off the issue . 
  * we have an [ anti-discrimination agency ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_council_for_combating_discrimination ) that shoots down any instance of discrimination * the sting of austerity was seen as an internal fuck-up , more than a foreign ( eu ) diktat . 
  but do n't go around thinking there is no nationalism or populism . 
  there is to some extent , but the virulent kind is quite marginal , compared to some other countries . 
  i encountered it in greece , where the pipes are too narrow . 
  my thought exactly . 
  greece ( or at least athens ) is the same . 
  spain is not a federal republic ( like germany ) . 
  it is a unitary state ( like poland ) , and as such , the privileges of autonomy are granted by the central government , unlike in the federal state , where the federal government is given power by the states . 
  the catalans want to switch to a federal model , whereby catalonia becomes a sovereign state , federalized with the rest of spain . 
  they do n't like the centralized model because they fear madrid could revoke their autonomy , and there is the added symbolic aspect where in a unitary state is subservient to madrid . 
  in a federal model , it is madrid who is given powers by catalonia , so in a sense , the roles are switched . 
  disclaimer : i 'm not catalan . 
   and i 'm tired of being labeled a thing that does n't actually exist . 
  no ethnicity `` exists '' as something objective . 
  `` american '' is just as subjective as `` romanian '' or `` hungarian '' . 
   it 's not until we leave america that we find out it 's a lie . 
  it 's not a lie , but the context changes . 
  `` italian '' makes sense within the us . 
  but your context is different now that you 're in finland . 
  for example , pakistani identifies as `` asian '' in the uk , but that label applies differently in the us , where `` asian '' means east asian . 
   so depending on person who asks i ' l tell different things .
