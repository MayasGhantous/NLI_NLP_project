  i think this is the problem . 
  she wants to cling to the `` italian '' label when in finland she has to contextualize it differently . 
  also , there 's the thing that she 's mixed ethnicity , which makes her look more `` american '' than `` italian '' . 
   but we do n't have our own language neither do austrians . 
  or the sanmarinese . 
   especially if they 're a majority , or a strong minority , in one specific region and especially since that region actually has a constitutional status . 
   as an example , christianity has played a significant role in maintaining our identity during the ottoman period . 
  you are shifting the subject . 
  we were talking about the creation of our national identity , which is a 19 ^ th century phenomenon . 
  i 'd argue that the enlightenment and the realisation that our language is latin-derived played an enormously larger part in the definition of our national identity . 
  we are more defined by our latin-ness than our religion . 
   as an example , christianity has played a significant role in maintaining our identity during the ottoman period . 
  but the albanians were christian once and converted to islam almost entirely . 
  yet still they did not lose their identity . 
  then they became extremely secular . 
  still they did not lose their identity . 
   around romania there peoples that have converted en masse to islam exactly . 
  it was the internal autonomy that the romanian principalities enjoyed , an autonomy which forbade muslim settlement , which kept us un-muslim to the degree that it did , not our religion . 
   for starters we would probably not get french fries in our shawarma . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by this . 
   anyway , my argument is that our christianity defines a lot of how we are as a people , like it or not . 
  it does , because we have built a narrative around this idea ( a borderline mantra i 'd say ) . 
  a narrative with a lot of holes in it . 
  and even if christianity ( actually , the story says `` orthodox christianity '' , not any kind ) was important once , it does n't mean that losing it is tantamount to losing a `` meaningful cultural features of a society '' . 
  a lot of nations have secularized their society without losing anything meaningful . 
  au contraire . 
  interesting tidbit : the dude [ to the left in this picture ] ( http://zoom.mediafax.ro/people/obiceiuri-religioase-12010280/imaginea-4#foto ) is the mufti of the muslims in romania . 
   the comunists made them this way , religiousness is just a side effect of hopelessness and ignorance . 
  communists have actually done a lot increase literacy and decrease religiousness . 
  compare illiteracy in the 1989 to that of 1930 for example . 
   in a society such as the romanian one where religion has played an enormous role in the creation of a national identity ok , i 'll bite . 
  how so ? 
  romanian version of that kind of site : http://www.porcisme.ro/, 
  [ `` be clean '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vergonha#late_19th_century_-_policies_and_legacy_of_jules_ferry ), 
   how much will this help ? 
  [ ... ] will this promotion of endangered languages actually help ? 
  it will help slow down the decline . 
  whether the decline will stop , or whether it will reverse depends many factors afaik . 
  i think / r/linguistics could give you a much more in-depth answer to this . 
   i 'm not well informed , but was n't french just a minority language in the early middle ages ? 
  yeah . 
  sort of . 
  but we should take `` french '' to mean the [ oil dialects ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_french#langue_d.27o.c3.afl ) , and even then i remember reading that only about half ( or slightly less then half ) of france spoke those dialects ( the northern half ) . 
   i read somewhere in another thread that romania is named after the romani people romania ( older spelling roumania , rumania ) is named after the romanians , the dominant ethnic group in the country , who speak a language descended from latin . 
  romanian comes from the latin `` romanus '' meaning `` roman ( i.e. 
  an inhabitant of rome , of the roman empire ) ''  the romani people , which is a name derived from the term `` citizen of rome '' . 
  the romani people ( also know as gypsies ) get their name from the word `` roma '' meaning `` man , husband '' in their language ( which is an indo-iranian language , related to hindi , bengali and other languages from northern india ) . 
  the word probably comes from the sanskrit * \u1e0doma * `` a man of low caste , living by singing and music '' , which also gave us the ethnonyms dom ( middle-eastern gypsies ) and lom ( armenian gypsies ) . 
  there is a widespread myth that roma ( ni ) comes from `` romania '' or `` romanoi '' ( name the byzantines used for themselves ) because the roma spent a lot of time within both the eastern roman empire ( aka . 
  byzantine empire ) and the romanian principalities ( 5 centuries of slavery ) .

  there was an 18 ^ th century dutch coin that circulated around these parts called [ the lion-taler ] ( http://www.numispedia.de/l%f6wentaler ) , because it had a lion rampant [ on one side ] ( http://www.numispedia.de/upload/f/f5/l%f6wentaler_rv.jpg ) . 
  people just called them `` lions '' for short .

   italian politics might be corrupt and everything , but it sure is fun as hell .
