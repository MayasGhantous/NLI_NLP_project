  nope , we were always here ? 
  we both know people were not talking about geography . 
  found [ this article ] ( http://cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=251620 ) on / r/romania after posting :  [ ... ] when contacted by a cineuropa reporter , film critic and fipresci member cristina corciovescu , now the rating commission 's president , justified the decision with a simple `` it tells kids it 's ok to be gay , so it has to be forbidden '' . 
   the interdiction of nymphomaniac part 2 is even more surprising when one takes into account the members of the commission , a topic of great debate among romanian film journalists : according to film website filmreporter , the commission is formed , among a few others , by cristina dochianu , a former model for the local edition of playboy magazine , narcisa tcaciuc , a former entertainment show host , alexandru chifu , an accountant , and tudorel butoi , a trained criminal psychologist . 
  also , regarding the last dude :  some two years ago , tudorel burtoi found himself under review by the national council for combating discrimination for misogynistic and sexist statements ( `` on october 20 , 2010 , nccd has made a ruling that sanctioned the discriminatory statements of forensic expert tudorel barrels made on realitatea tv news channel in february 2010 . 
  the forensic expert said that unlike men , women victims of violence by men are guilty of provocation [ provoking the men ] `` says the website of the nccd ) ** le ** they reversed the ban . 
   after prodding ukrainian president viktor yanukovych to reject a trade and political agreement with the european union in november , putin risks looking like the loser , said michael emerson , formerly the bloc 's envoy in moscow . 
  `` a few weeks ago it looked like putin was winning . 
  now putin is losing . 
  this should be a setting for a thorough re-think by both parties , particularly russia , '' emerson said . 
  this is straight up bs . 
  eu came out worse than putin from this summit . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/1weejh/strategic_no_more_at_the_summit_eu_loses_ground/  putin , in his turn , did not refrain from expressing his irritation at eu 's insistent involvement in ukraine : `` how would our eu partners react if , let 's say , in a full crisis in greece or cyprus , our foreign minister would go to encourage the anti-eu demonstrations ? 
   asked if the huge loan of 15 billion euros promised to kiev in order not to sign the association agreement with the eu would stand in case the opposition came to power in kiev , putin said : `` of course it would stand . 
  it is a commercial loan . 
  we do business with ukraine regardless of who is in power . 
  we even did business with ukraine when tymoshenko was in power '' , referring to the jailed former premier and opposition figure yulia tymoshenko , a personal rival of ukraine 's president viktor yanukovych . 
   except for a common `` statement on combating terrorism '' , the only concrete achievement of this summit was a surprising one , announced by van rompuy : `` we both agreed to pursue bilateral consultations at experts level on the eastern partnership association agreement '' . 
   regardless of how it is presented , this is a serious setback for the commission , and the eu at large , in front of russia . 
  putin 's discontent with eu had started during the autumn of 2013 , when the eu asked russia to end using trade agreements to block east european nations from seeking closer relations , or signing special trade and association agreements with the bloc . 
  in october , the eu foreign ministers even discussed possible trade measures to be considered against russia in response to political and economic pressure exerted by moscow on east european nations . 
   european commissioner for enlargement and neighborhood policy \u0160tefan f\u00fcle even said then that `` russia 's pressure on ukraine in the issue of signing the association agreement with the european union is unacceptable '' , an unusually harsh statement by commission 's standards . 
  in the end , the eu announced meekly today that it is ready to offer russia `` bilateral consultations at experts level on the eastern partnership association agreement '' . 
  from the extreme of cavorting with the opposition on the maidan , kiev 's main square , where the protests have been going for two months , the eu high officials went now to the opposite extreme of offering russian experts to discuss with the eu the association agreements offered to neighbouring countries . 
   the europeans have also dropped demands for the liberation of yulia tymoshenko , and the fact that the only one who pronounced her name -- in an ironic way -- was putin was another point he scored .

  another stereotype is that they want to steal transylvania . 
  also the romanian stereotype about transylvanians is very simmilar to that of the hungarian stereotype about szekler ( i.e. 
  `` calm , slow in thinking and acting '' , except the szeklers also have a stereotype of rural bumpkins , hence all the jokes about `` old szekler goes to budapest for the first time ... '' ) also an interesting fact is that the same `` calm , slow in thinking and acting '' is widespread towards other finno-ugric peoples , the stereotype of the finn among scandinavians and the estonians among the balts being similar .

  via / r/europeans : * [ dienekes ' comment  ( http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2014/01/brown-skinned-blue-eyed-y-haplogroup-c.html ) *  there is nothing like a little ancient dna weirdness to start off 2014 , which promises to be as exciting as 2013 was . 
   the new study la brana 1 identifies it as ancestral in the slc24a5 locus in which virtually all europeans are derived . 
  this comes in the heels of the loschbour preprint which identified that sample from luxembourg as also being ancestral . 
  taken together , it 's now clear that hunter-gatherers from mesolithic western europe were brown . 
   curiously , it now seems that both europe and india were ( in part ) inhabited by brown people and became lighter by a process of admixture + selection . 
  the process went `` all the way '' in europe , but a cline of pigmentation was sustained in india . 
   the other finding ( not mentioned in the abstract ) is that la brana 1 belonged to y-haplogroup c6 !, 
  this is a low-frequency european clade of haplogroup c . so now , we have evidence that haplogroup c is not eastern eurasian ( as the presence of its subclades in australia , india , east asia , and the americas might suggest ) , but a pan-eurasian entity . 
  it remains to be seen whether this c-in-europe can be pushed further back in time , but finding it in mesolithic iberia reduces the chance that it 's some random eastern eurasian who made it to the outskirts of europe recently . 
   finally , la brana 1 has derived alleles at loci associated with pathogen resistance . 
  this might be important , because a common hypothesis is that europeans developed this type of resistance during the neolithic as they started interacting with the pathogens of domesticated species and started living in less-hygienic higher-density settlements . 
  fuck it .

  no it was n't , and stop pretending you know for certain otherwise , when all you have are speculations . 
  the ukrainian flag also represents , last i checked , the state that is currently besieged by the protesters . 
  so it 's hardly an exclusively opposition symbol . 
   implying there is a hivemind here that longs for the eu to take over ukraine , and not the opposite . 
  it 's not implying anything . 
  you are making a lot of baseless assumptions . 
  the flag is there so that it highlights the most important news at the moment ( hence the mouseover text : * `` hot topic du jour : euromaidan '' * ) . 
  we plan to change the snoo for other events as well . 
  also the ukrainian flag is not politically charged as is the syrian flag for example . 
  given that it represents both the state , and the people , it can be interpreted any which way . 
  exactly this .
