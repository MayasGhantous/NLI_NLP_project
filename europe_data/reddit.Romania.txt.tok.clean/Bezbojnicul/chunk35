  please repost this to the [ euromaidan megathread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vyaa6/euromaidan_thread_1_discussionslinks_regarding/ ) . 
  i 'm not sure if this qualifies as an important development ( [ as per this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vyc42/mod_please_post_minor_news_photos_videos_in_our/ ) ) but the fact that it 's google translated makes it a more suitable candidate for the megathread , rather than the front page . 
  at least until a human-english version is available from a good source . 
  it falls under `` etc. 
  '' , as the purpose of that thread was [ stated here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vyc42/mod_please_post_minor_news_photos_videos_in_our/ ) ( to reduce clutter on the frontpage of the subreddit ) . 
  that thread was sticky for some hours . 
  i 've updated the [ megathread ] to make it extra clear . 
  they can see our support in the [ megathread ] , or if you want to send a personal message , you can do it in / r/ukraine . 
  this kind of thread is exactly the reason why the [ megathread ] was created . 
   do n't make us write a strong-worded letter !, 
   before you do , look in the flair section , rightmost column , fifth flair from the bottom ( between hamburg and slavonia ) . 
  it 's been there for quite some time . 
   tonight ( 23-24 .01 ) in many regions protesters stormed the governor 's offices . 
  a lot of governors ' offices being stormed . 
  this might escalate shit in the wrong direction . 
  now available in map format : http://imgur.com/a/l5jdt * edit * small update, 
  yeah . 
  when i was in andalusia this summer , i visited some students that had just moved to an awesome apartment in the center of granada because the rents had dropped like hell , and now they could afford it . 
   to be honest , this does n't really seem like anything new . 
  got the same feeling when reading this . 
   1st link - the current top comment ( from khrystyna ) is very spot on , nothing to add for the lazy :  * that is not really the whole the truth . 
  let me , as a ukrainian , speak up . 
  you are right , when you 're saying , that svododa is a neofascists party . 
  and you 're right with all of these pics . 
  but you 're wrong with the term ` neo-nazis and far-right protesters ' . 
  *  * people , who are now fighting and giving their health or even lives away on the streets of kyiv are simple people , not enganged in neither ` far-left ' , nor ` far-right ' movements . 
  the right sector ( fas\u0441ists organisation ) started the uprising on 19th of january , thus it does not mean that only they are now continuing it . 
  people from all over ukraine ( mainly west part of it ) are supporting this uprising , only because they are fed up with all of dictators rules and laws and because the president 's family live in prosperities , while simple ukrainian is labouring day and night . 
  the uprising is spontaneous , that is people 's fit of anger . 
  *  * svoboda and other opposition leaders are losing their authorities among people , but the other thing is that people do not know what to do and how to live without the statutory authority . 
  so they will , probably , vote for one of opposition 's leader , not for oleh tyahnybok , but for vitalii klytschko or the third one . 
  *  * that 'll happen if the opposition wins . 
  what will happen when yanykovych wins , i am afraid even to think . 
  ukraine will become the second belarus or even worse . 
  both ` far-right ' an ` far-left ' activist will be sentenced or killed . 
  man , i totally forgot about this thread , 
  advocating murder is a good way to getting yourself banned from this subreddit . 
  consider yourself warned . 
  this needs to be made into a bar graph ... 
   eu citizens have seen very few ordinary romanians so far ; many have , without knowing they were romanians . 
  we 're everywhere , trust me . 
   romania has always been very tolerant about gypsies , that 's why , so many of them live in our country . 
  except ... you know ... more than 4 centuries of [ slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) in some parts of romania . 
  plus , `` better than medieval western europe '' ( where they were hunted like animals ) is still a long way from `` very tolerant '' . 
  also , how old are you ? 
  whatever . 
  if both populations want it , sure . 
  but i do n't think serbia will recognize kosovo any time soon . 
  but do the albanians really want to get bogged down by kosovo ? 
   wait until you hear why eastern europeans are called `` slavs '' actually , it 's the slaves that get their name after the slavs , not the other way around . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave&amp;allowed_in_frame=0  late 13c. , `` person who is the chattel or property of another , '' from old french esclave ( 13c . 
  ) , from medieval latin sclavus `` slave '' ( source also of italian schiavo , french esclave , spanish esclavo ) , originally `` slav '' ( see slav ) ; so used in this secondary sense because of the many slavs sold into slavery by conquering peoples . 
  this sense development arose in the consequence of the wars waged by otto the great and his successors against the slavs , a great number of whom they took captive and sold into slavery . 
  [ klein ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slav#ethnonym  the slavic autonym slov\u011bnin\u044a is usually considered a derivation from slovo `` word '' , originally denoting `` people who speak ( the same language ) , '' i.e. 
  people who understand each other , in contrast to the slavic word denoting `` foreign people '' -- n\u011bmci , meaning `` mumbling , murmuring people '' ( from slavic n\u011bm\u044a -- `` mumbling , mute '' ) . 
  the latter word may be the derivation of words to denote german/germanic people in many later slavic languages, 
  [ ahab ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vjmvodj2ipo/tzg5d0fjhgi/aaaaaaaad20/s5vzc1kyzui/s1600/ben%2bheppner.jpg ), 
   and most important , will russia let us intervene ( if they 're not interfering by force before ) ? 
  i can see russia sending in troops as well , to protect its bases in crimea . 
  and that could escalate into a west germany / east germany ( cyprus/vietnam/korea ) kind of divided country . 
  question : if the situation in ukraine escalates close to civil war , should the eu sent in peacekeepers , like [ in car ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140117/defreg01/301170031/eu-set-agree-military-mission-central-african-republic ) ? 
  man , i 'm all for acknowledging racism directed towards the roma , but this article is pretty amateurish ( the text part , i ca n't watch the vid right now ) . 
   the roma first settled in these areas a full thousand years ago more like the 14 ^ th century . 
   either enslaved that happened in moldavia and wallachia , not the kingdom of hungary afaik . 
   hungary was with the fascists too . 
  how old is the person who wrote this sentence ? 
   the roma did n't have anything to do with the banking crisis , but they 're being blamed for europe 's new poverty now . 
  they are blamed for high criminality and being a drain on welfare , not the financial crisis . 
  the former mayor of cluj-napoca , [ sorin apostu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorin_apostu ) , was known as \u201e fifty-fifty '' . 
  greedy fucker . 
  got 3 +1 / 2 years in jail . 
  latin had no word for \u201e yes '' . 
  most western romance languages used \u201e sic '' - \u201e thus , this way '' . 
  so it does n't surprise me that it gets translated as : europe such fucked, 
  ** romania ** * best news : [ romania 's constitutional court has struck down , unanimously , a proposed law that would have limited corruption probes into politicians ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romanian-court-rejects-bill-aimed-to-curb-corruption-probes ) . 
  mps still twatss for proposing the law in the first place . 
  * our president met with european council president herman van rompuy on january 16 in brussels . 
  he said `` [ romania intends to become a member of the schengen area by the end of the year ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/president-ive-informed-ecs-rompuy-that-romania-intends-to-join-schengen-by-end-2014/113082/ ) '' . 
  given the news above , i do n't think we won a lot of confidence with western european nations . 
  * since we 're at the \u201e presidential declarations '' department , [ he said that ] ( http://actmedia.eu/daily/president-basescu-romania-should-start-internal-debate-on-whether-to-agree-uniting-with-rep.-moldova/49931 ) \u201e romania should start an internal debate , which has nothing to do with the chisinau politicians , on whether it would agree to unite with the republic of moldova '' and that moldova is a country that has a frozen conflict in transdnestr on its territory and a problem with ` the autonomist temptations of gagauzia ' ( they have autonomy since ' 94 ) . 
  * corruption investigations looming over constan\u021ba county . 
  [ the chairman of the county council , nicusor constantinescu , was taken by the anti-corruption prosecutors for hearings as there was a peremptory writ on his name ] ( http://actmedia.eu/daily/nicusor-constantinescu-taken-by-the-prosecutors-and-sent-to-dna/50116 ) . 
  sources say radu maz\u0103re , the flamboyant mayor of constan\u021ba will soon join him . 
  i wish them both long years inside . 
  * a romanian tourist who vanished after he got separated from his son on the london metro over three days ago [ has been found ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/18/romanian-tourist-lost-on-london-underground-found-safe-and-well-4267771/ ) * also in the \u201e positive news from the uk '' , [ we still have n't invaded yet ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/wealthy-romanian-heads-to-the-uk-not-economic-migrants ) , and neither have the bulgarian . 
  but since we 're lazy , maybe we 'll invade at a later date ... 
  so is the * turkish rep. o ' northern cyprus *, 
  [ article in romanian ] ( http://limbacailor.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/autonomiile-europei-catalunya-si-catalanii/ ) + [ wiki ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia ), 
  ** [ source ] ( http://www.quora.com/latin-language/how-do-you-say-fuck-yeah-in-latin ) . 
  chose this option because it 's close to the romanian `` europa , da futu-i ! '', 
   what 's strange is that the plural is used . 
  we last longer than a christ . 
  we won !, 
  yeah . 
  greece . 
  and now she knows what it feels like to be eastern european ... 
  technically correct is the best kind of correct !, 
   if i put my hand through a letter box , i am not ` in the house ' .
