  what if you put your head through the window ? 
  are you in the house then ? 
  you know , in case russia comes up next ... 
   if this is illegal activity then its un-likely officials will admit to it or allow local journalists to report on it . 
  it is not illegal , but well within the [ bulgarian citizenship act ] ( http://www.bulgarianembassy-london.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;itemid=175 ) :  ** article 12 ** any person who is not a bulgarian citizen may acquire bulgarian citizenship if as of the date of filing an application for naturalization :  1 . is a major ; 2 . was granted permission for permanent residence in the republic of bulgaria not less than five years ago ; 3 . has not been sentenced by a bulgarian court for a premeditated crime of a general nature and has not been the subject of criminal proceedings for such a crime unless the person concerned has been rehabilitated ; 4 . has an income and occupation enabling him/her to support himself/herself in the republic of bulgaria ; 5 . has a command of the bulgarian language subject to verification in accordance with a procedure established by an order of the minister of education and culture , and 6 . 
  ( new sg no . 
  41/2000 ) was released from his/her previous citizenship or will be released from his/her citizenship as of the moment of acquiring the bulgarian citizenship . 
  [ ... ]  ** article 15 ** ( amended sg no . 
  41/2001 )  any person who is not a bulgarian citizen may acquire bulgarian citizenship through naturalization not subject to the provisions of article 12 , sub-paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 if he/she meets one of the following requirements :  * 1 . is of a bulgarian origin ; * 2 . has been adopted by a bulgarian citizen on terms of full adoption ; 3 . one of his/her parents is a bulgarian citizen or has passed away as a bulgarian citizen . 
  so if somebody is `` of bulgarian origin '' he can `` acquire bulgarian citizenship if as of the date of filing an application for naturalization ** 1 ** . 
  is a major ; and ** 3 . 
  ** has not been sentenced by a bulgarian court for a premeditated crime of a general nature [ ... ] . 
  other countries have similar `` get citizenship quick '' , including romania and hungary . 
  there is a pragmatic vibe to iurie leanca , it seams to me . 
  i do n't know what the perception is inside moldova , but from the outside it feels like the moldovans are taking a very constructive approach to things . 
  they feel more focused . 
  that being said , i doubt the transdniestrians will take the offer . 
  an intern ( * romanian `` medic rezident '' * ) , fresh out of college . 
  i think that 's the basic salary , and he gets some bonuses ( not that familiar with the details of the salary system , tbh ) . 
  according to [ this news-site ] ( http://www.zf.ro/zf-24/rezidentii-castiga-800-de-lei-iar-medicii-renumiti-ajung-la-mii-de-euro-pe-luna-11615215 ) :  if an intern has a net salary of 180 $ ( which can become double twith bonuses ) , the base salary of a primary doctor has a base salaray of 400 $ , and a renowned doctor , with a management position in a big bucharest hospital can earn , officially , up to 15.000-16 .000 $ a month . 
  but the accent was on the `` fresh out of college '' category . 
  top comment over at / r/romania . 
   an intern cardiologist earned ~ 800 lei/mo . 
  all the interns ' salaries , in all fields , would be around 10 million $ / year . 
  it would have been very easy to simply double all the salaries 10 years ago , given how public money is being wasted ( the [ contract with bechtel ] ( http://www.bizlawyer.ro/stiri/english/contract-with-bechtel-terminated-cnadnr-to-take-over-transilvania-motorway-working-site ) had cost 1.4 billion $ + damages of 37 million $ ... for scale ), 
   did n't think anyone outside sweden knew about that . 
  of course we do .

  this map was made sometime between jan. 2004 - june 2006 , because eu25 and no montenegro . 
   aybe some british doctors come to romania to go full circle :d closest thing i know of is french students coming to romania to study medicine . 
  [ article in english ] ( http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-7072339-debate-the-french-press-medicine-students-who-fail-exams-france-masquerade-studies-romania.htm ) and [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_inbu1mkdm ), 
  i personally know at least 4 people in their late 20s/early 30s who work as doctors abroad ( 3 in the uk , 1 in germany ) and another one will be leaving for germany the day after tomorrow . 
  ca n't watch the video right now , but i suspect it 's [ geam\u0103na ] ( http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/the-shared-fate-of-treece-kan-and-geamana-romania/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 ), 
   it was indicated that foreigners from outside the eu can obtain a passport for $ 1000 as long as they agreed to vacate the country immediately . 
  basically selling the passports to refugees and what not . 
  i 'm really gon na need a source on this one ... 
  the ruling coalition is made up of social-democrats ( psd ) and liberals ( pnl ) . 
  it is their bill that got rejected by the constitutional court . 
  some of the members of said constitutional court are : * [ toni grebl\u0103 ] ( http://www.ccr.ro/judector-toni-grebl ) - psd mp [ between 2008-2013 ] ( http://www.senat.ro/fisasenator.aspx?parlamentarid=ed76058c-825e-4e89-a434-19b708fe537f ) * [ mona pivniceru ] ( http://www.ccr.ro/judector-mona-maria-pivniceru ) - former justice minister ( 2012-2013 ) under the current pm * [ valer dorneanu ] ( http://www.ccr.ro/judector-valer-dorneanu ) - psd mp [ between 2000-2008 ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=198&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2004&amp;pag=0&amp;idl=1 ) the last 2 were nominated to the constitutional court by the current coalition in 2013 , the first guy a year before . 
   although , i 'm sure someone 's going to reply to this explaining how it 's not as good as it sounds . 
  the standard story for spinning this around is that the president/presidential party ( `` the opposition '' ) has control the constitutional court , and therefore this is a political decision . 
  ( ** edit : ** well color me surprised ! ), 
   in politics , your worst enemies are rarely in other parties . 
  there 's a romanian saying that goes something like : * `` god , defend me from friends , because from enemies , i 'll do it myself '' *, 
   two arabic languages fyi , one is arabic , the other is persian , totally unrelated to arabic . 
  but they wo n't be bothering us any more . 
  friendly reminder that / r/europics also exists , 
  the macedonian ethnic identity is newer than most european ethnic identities . 
  while most were established in the middle of the 19th century , macedonian ethnic identity crystalized in the early 20th century afaik . 
  also see [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_question#macedonian_question ), 
   now if we could only get the same process going in hungary ... 
  surely you mean `` america '' , 
  i think your average romanian would go with michael the brave , vlad the impaler or stephen the great before thinking of cuza . 
   created literary finnish from almost nothing talk about exaggerations . 
  you make it sound as if literary finnish is a con-lang , like esperanto . 
  plus the fact that it 's not about political parties any more . 
  all the parties will come with a candidate for pres. 
  of commission , so this whole election will be more `` personal '' . 
  they also [ complained ] ( http://www.b365.ro/biserica-interzice-capacele-de-canalizare-cu-stema-bucurestiului-pe-ele_177973.html ) that manhole covers in bucharest need to change because [ they feature the coa of bucharest , which contains the cross twice ] ( http://www.b365.ro/media/image/201206/w620/capac-canalizare.jpg ) , so stepping on said covers is blasphemous . 
  ** romania ** - the week started on a positive note . 
  romania ex-pm adrian nastase [ jailed in bribery case ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25630091 ) . 
  this is the second time he is sent to jail . 
  - the biggest thing this week however was the scandal involving [ a teacher who was filmed aggressively demanding gifts ] ( http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/01/10/3521179/romanian-teacher-who-demanded.html ) from pupil 's parents . 
  she said that the gifts given to school staff was too measly , and called parents `` sheep , '' `` potatoes '' and `` poor . '', 
  she was fired , but the case has caused a lot of debate about gift-giving by parents to teachers , corruption , and the poor financing of education in general . 
  - assistant us secretary of state , victoria nuland , [ visited romania ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/us-official-romania-should-be-clean-ally-for-us/2014/01/11/1a42f6f8-7aa9-11e3-a647-a19deaf575b3_story.html ) . 
  she met with senior romanian government officials and members of civil society , and criticized recent legislation which would make it more difficult to prosecute lawmakers and would make libel a criminal offense . 
  - in the [ trial ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romanian-deputy-pm-faces-election-fraud-charges ) regarding last year 's presidential impeachment referendum , where the vice-pm is indicted along with 74 other people for election rigging , two people being indicted admitted to forging 8 signatures and ballot-stuffing . 
  - first section of the [ controversial buze\u0219ti-berzei-uranus boulevard ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/bucharest-welcomes-new-enlarged-boulevard-but-bemoans-loss-of-old-buildings-along-the-way/111772/ ) opened . 
  in order to enlarge the existing boulevard , several buildings along the road were demolished , including the historic matache hall , a former historic peasant market . 
  - two gynecologists and an anesthesiology arrested for demanding bribe ( 1900 lei , which is ~ 420 euro ) to perform a c-section . 
  only the 1 and 2 euro . 
  but , yeah , i dislike it too . 
  to be fair , latvia did a good job with the design , imo . 
   how some british newspapers use manipulation ... to paraphrase a recently popular thread here on / r/europe . 
  serbia being to blame ? 
  my reaction a well . 
  afaik their voice will be severely diminished due to a lot of unmet promisses . 
  so : even more scary !, 
  so t0 is a kitchen + bathroom ? 
  romanian - native hungarian - native but a bit rusty english - learned in school , fluent french - learned in school and in private , intermediate ( was better , but got rusty due to lack of use ) italian - learned from tv , can speak at a very basic level , understand a bit more dutch - just started learning, 
  we 're workin on it !, 
   but politicians from both sides see the concept as a way to reach a `` new '' electorate , so they milk the subject . 
  actually , the moldovan politicians are n't pushing reunification , they are pushing european integration . 
  reunification is not really that popular . 
   how is the idea of reunification viewed in the 2 countries ? 
  romania : ~ 70 % for it . 
  moldova : ~ 15 % for it . 
   also , does moldova differ culturally in any significant way from romania ? 
  some . 
  200 years of russian influence have had a bit of influence . 
   did anyone calculate what the actual cost for romania would be in case of a reunification ? 
  there was a 2006 article in cotidianul . 
  while the original is n't on the cotidianul website anymore , [ you can read it here ] ( http://stiri.acasa.ro/social-125/cati-bani-ne-ar-costa-unirea-cu-basarabia-75878.html ) , albeit the formating is shit . 
  also found another , [ more recent article ] ( http://ro.stiri.yahoo.com/costurile-%c5%9fi-beneficiile-unirii-republicii-moldova-cu-rom%c3%a2nia-115500282.html ) with some relevant info . 
  la vita e bela , life of others and pan 's labyrinth . 
  do it !, 
   if moldova gets in , transylvania gets out , and i 'd be ready to fight for that . 
  szeklerland is the only part of transylvania that might `` leave '' , and even that is highly unlikely . 
  the transylvanian romanians are n't leaving romania .
