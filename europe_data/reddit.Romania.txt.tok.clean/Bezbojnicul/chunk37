   dude , 76 % of romanians are for the union according to this poll from last november . 
  i wonder if priming respondents with a few economic questions would result in a lower number ? 
  romanians usually support unification * in principle * but some get a little hesitant when they think of the costs . 
  / u/txaption ? 
   but either way , this winter is over ; hell , i 'm still waiting for it to begin , tbh . 
   they have one last trump card - transnistria . 
  has n't gagauzia been restless as well lately ? 
   unemployment rates eu-28 , ea-17 , us and japan , seasonally adjusted , january 2000 - november 2013 what happened in 2011 that made unemployment rise again in the eu and fall in the us ? 
  [ english article 1 ] ( http://actmedia.eu/daily/works-on-iasi-ungheni-gas-pipe-completed/49959 ) and [ 2 ] ( http://trm.md/en/economic/lucrari-finalizate-la-gazoductul-iasi-ungheni-pe-teritoriul-romaniei/ )  the main works ** in romania ** for the gas pipe between romania and moldova on the iasi-ungheni route were completed , a press release of the national agency for mineral resources shows . 
  this seems to imply that the article is only about work on the romanian side . 
  what about the moldovan side ? 
  ** edit ** found [ this article ] ( https://www.rfi.ro/stiri-politica-46609-leanca-rfi-gazoductul-iasi-ungheni-rep-moldova-sunt-aplicate-standarde ) ( [ g!translated ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.rfi.ro%2fstiri-politica-46609-leanca-rfi-gazoductul-iasi-ungheni-rep-moldova-sunt-aplicate-standarde ) ) which says the moldovan side still has work to do . 
  they are not out of harm 's way yet , but maybe the winter will be unusually mild this year   mp leanca explains to rfi that there are problems in the construction pipeline iasi ungheni because soviet standards apply which affect the design . 
  `` we must apply european standards , as we proposed , since we are joining the european union . 
  colleagues assure me that we could complete [ the work ] by march . 
  simultaneously , there are talk about issues related to management of the pipeline , the terms of gas supply . 
  residents of villages of nisporeni and ungheni raions will be supplied from the new gas pipeline. , we talked again about the feasibility study and the other components that will allow us in two to three years to have the potential to import gas in larger quantities of the west and from the east respectively , to have the infrastructure , the logistics . 
  to have two vendors and better negotiating skills , `` said prime minister leanc\u0103 . 
  generally . 
  relevant thread from about a year ago : [ in romania , a party can only participate in the national parliamentary elections only if it pays a fee of 2355 minimum monthly wages ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13t0xo/in_romania_a_party_can_only_participate_in_the/ ), 
  i , on the other hand , quite like it . 
  [ `` the atheist / godless '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bezbozhnik_%28magazine%29 ), 
   its just somewhat recently egypt became a `` islamic majority state '' . 
  well according to [ this ] ( http://www.answering-islam.org/history/islamization_egypt.html ) , muslims became a majority in the 9 ^ th century , and according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_copts#the_arab-muslim_invasion_of_egypt ) it did so in the 12 ^ th century . 
  i would n't call either date `` somewhat recently '' tbh . 
  i mean , brits were expecting us to be on time , first thing january 1 ^ st ? 
  we 're lazy , of course we 're gon na be late a bit . 
   why do you care so much ? 
  i always get a little bit puzzled as to why someone not living in sweden would care about this topic . 
   some facts about sweden :  * [ awesome things ] * this is precisely why people `` care '' . 
  if someone can sell the idea that immigration is destroying an awesome country like sweden , then it follows that immigrations will be even more destructive on countries that are not doing as fine as sweden . 
  i mean `` if sweden ca n't handle this shit , we sure ca n't '' kind of thing . 
  it does n't . 
  you clicked below , on `` nation-by-will '' . 
   but come from `` princeps '' ( `` first one '' ) and used to refer to any sort of sovereign or semi-sovereign head of state or statelet ( a `` principalty '' ) : hence the princes of monaco and liechtenstein , or the co-princes of andorra . 
  if we go deeper :  [ princeps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princeps ) ( plural : principes ) is a latin word meaning `` first in time or order ; the first , chief , the most eminent , distinguished , or noble ; the first man , first person . '', 
   princeps ( in this sense usually translated as `` first citizen '' ) was an official title of a roman emperor as the title determining the leader in ancient rome at the beginning of the roman empire . 
  it created the principate roman imperial system . 
  this usage of `` princeps '' derived from the position of princeps senatus , the `` first among equals '' of the senate . 
  the princeps senatus ( plural principes senatus ) was the first member by precedence of the roman senate . 
   i 'm aware of that sherlock , what is your point ? 
  times change , and new times need new sacrifices . 
  this time , not one of blood . 
  unless you want to see france shrink more and more , while the rest of the world overtake her . 
   they were n't fighting against france , but for the vision they had for it . 
  same difference . 
  some people 's vision of france is one where it is part of the eu . 
  it 's not against france , it 's against your vision of france . 
   why would n't it be ? 
  why is the eu important ? 
  i do n't like to spit in the soup ( not sure if this one exists in burgerspeak ) . 
  i 'll let le g\u00e9neral speak for me i 'd rather * you * speak for yourself . 
  with answers , rather than questions . 
  i see being polite is difficult ( i expected otherwise from a frenchman ) , but surely you can at least try to make a case for `` independence '' . 
   this meant that the states were not entirely sovereign , since they did not have the authority to leave the union . 
  afaik the issue of whether or not a state can secede was kinda settled by the civil war . 
  brb , imma go dig around / r/askhistorians a bit . 
  ** le : ** so it seems it [ was n't clear , and people argued about it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/zm172/the_american_civil_war_what_is_the_prevailing/ ), 
   it breaks my heart that people want to destroy something patiently built for more than a thousand year . 
  [ ... ] i find it disgusting and incredibly ungrateful that people who reap the benefits of all these years of patient sowing just want to tear it down now . 
  have you considered that maybe they are not trying to tear something down , but to build something better upon that which has already been built ? 
   people died so france can preserve its might yet france is not as mighty as it used to be , and by itself probably wo n't be again . 
   people died so france can preserve its [ ... ] independance what about people who died to preserve france 's monarchical system ? 
  what about people who died fighting against centralisation , for an independent corsica for example ? 
  what about corsica 's independence ? 
  people died for a lot of reasons . 
  why is `` france 's independence '' important ? 
   there are people in france who have not only lost any pride in their nationality , but who even want the end of france as a nation-state , they want it to be an european region . 
   position as `` humans are shit , this is the best we can do '' . 
  fyi , i do not hold this position . 
  but i do believe that tribalism is not something we can outgrow , unless we venture into the realms of sci-fi , with gataca-type genetic engineering . 
   that 's true , but to what extent will they integrate ? 
  indeed !, 
  i do n't know tbh . 
  who knows what events will push those entities in what direction . 
  they might not become superpowers , but an eu-like african union or arab league would ^ ( / will ? ), 
  be an interesting world player . 
  i 'd say the idea of social progress is way more prevalent than my cynical view of human nature . 
  maybe not as prevalent as 20 years ago , but still the norm imo . 
  not necessarily . 
  this is neither . 
  it 's a new thing imo , a weird combination of the two . 
   the closer we get to abolishing the idea of `` us vs the others '' . 
  call me a cynic , but i believe we 'll abolish `` us vs them '' the day the last human dies . 
   it 's an economic union , nothing else . 
  it 's much more to some . 
  romanians talk about `` european values '' all the time , and how we should aspire towards them . 
  it 's about our rightful place `` in europe '' , a place robbed by the ussr post-ww2 . 
  there is a lot of symbolism attached to being an eu member . 
  we 're not just here for the ka-ching . 
   because otherwise , if other regions or continents follow our lead , we will only end up with a whole series of regional superpowers - europe , a reborn caliphate , sub-saharan africa , etc. 
  these superpowers , if they arose , would n't be a progression towards a circle of trust , they would grate and shake against each other like tectonic plates , or like any other great nations . 
  that is exactly what 's happening . 
  integration is already taking place in [ several places ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supranational_union#other_international_organisations_with_some_degree_of_integration ) , or at least it 's being discussed , while other states are [ bound to be competition for the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potential_superpowers ) . 
  there 's already geopolitical friction on the eu/cis boundary . 
  yes and no . 
  humans always had group identities of one form of another . 
  tribal identities in the barbarian times , city-state identities , religious identities in medieval times ( christendom vs. islam ) . 
  with ( among other things ) the invention of the printing press and the rise of vernacular mass culture , religious identities gave way to national identities centered more often than not on a common language . ^ [ 1 ] now the world is becoming increasingly smaller and interconected , `` nationalism '' has lost a lot of its prestige in the first half of the 20 ^ th century , so `` nations '' in europe have realized that together is better than against each other ( partly because war traumatized us , partly because we former european world powers can not compete by themselves with emerging giants ) . 
  so in comes the eu and `` euro-nationalism '' ( currently still in embryonic form ) .
