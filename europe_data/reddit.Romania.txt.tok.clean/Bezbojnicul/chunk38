  it 's not your romantic type linguistic nationalism , but rather a `` cultural nationalism '' , kind of like [ the chinese ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imhumltlzpw ) . 
  because we are too diverse linguistically , just like the swiss , `` our '' nationalism is closer to the swiss model , a '' [ nation-by-will ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_people ) '' , where we band together because we are alike culturally , not linguistically or religiously . 
  hence the emphasys on '' [ european culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism ) '' ( something i find to be more of an ideological fiction , than something true ) . 
   they view it as a necessity for the eu to continue expanding ( to a degree , of course ) . 
  yes , and it 's a form of [ manifest destiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifest_destiny ) a la europeene . 
  there is a utopian/messianic undercurrent in the eu idea that one can not ignore . 
   is this a good thing or a bad thing ? 
  it 's both . 
  collective identities are dangerous beasts , but also a necessary evil . 
  humans are tribal by nature , so they seek group identies . 
  when one defines a collective identity , `` what * we * are '' one inherently defines the `` other '' as well . 
  if we are `` those who subscribe to european culture '' , the enemy is the one who does n't . 
  hence the the great emphasis by some on cultural otherness .

   i actually think that ukraine and espescially moldova and perhaps even georgia are probably going to join eu soon ( at least some of them ) . 
  soon being maybe 10-20 years . 
  ukraine seems unlikely given the pull-out at vilnius . 
  moldova and georgia are indeed getting more and more pro-eu , but the question is whether the eu wants 3 more northern cyprus-type scenarios ? 
  i know , but you ca n't ignore the copenhagen criteria . 
  politics matter , sure , but dismissing moldova just because the western balkans `` got a promise '' is silly . 
  what if kosovo or bosnia stagnate , but moldova moves ahead with the european criteria ? 
  seems to me that positive attitudes towards moldova have been rising in bruxelles lately . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gotland#culture apparently there are 94 churches in gotland . 
  with a population of 57.221 people , that ads up to ~ 608 people/church . 
  there are counties of romania with even higher church densities ( [ righmost column in this chart ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rwgorero0n8/s_-5dwoelxi/aaaaaaaaary/zbceubaisma/s1600/biserici.png ) ) , such as s\u0103laj county , with 457 people/church ( romanian average seems to be 1000 people/church ) . 
  so i would n't say it 's that high a number . 
  we 're already halfway there . 
  [ flag of romania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/flag_of_romania.svg/500px-flag_of_romania.svg.png ) and [ flag of moldova ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/flag_of_moldova.svg/500px-flag_of_moldova.svg.png ) . 
   i think the results will be negative in what way ? 
  just the usual turks , arabs , chinese . 
  still few of them but more then before . 
  a funny thing is that there were a few chinese that came from hungary when their economy went down , and we had chinese who spoke no romanian but did speak hungarian ( about 1/4 of oradea is ethnic hungarian , and some of the romanians understand the language as well to some degree ) . 
   i think we do n't want to make russia any more angry/concerned . 
  the eu 's foreign policy does n't revolve around russia 's feelings . 
   they never made that promise towards moldova and ukraine . 
  that does n't automatically exclude moldova , or diminish its chances , because in the end its the copenhagen criteria that matter . 
  i 'd say moldova has as good a chance as kosovo or bosnia, 
  y u no moldova ?

  there has been an uptick in `` foreign faces '' ( beside the usual foreign students ) in the last 5-10 years , especially in oradea , where i live . 
  was he an ethnic gagauz , or romanian-moldovan ? 
  i would think that after 1 + million romanians emigrated to spain , the spaniards would know a bit more / have a better reputation about romanians . 
   walloons dirty skirt-wearing roman immigrants !, 
  went to andalucia this summer . 
  listening to conversations ( met some local youths , friends of a friend ) was more challenging than expected , as my brain had to fill in the blanks , and i 'm not that good at spanish . 
  i speak a variety of hungarian spoken in central romania , and slang is very much local ( romanian and romany influenced , not to mention mine is probably a bit outdated ) . 
  hungarian hungarian ( especially slang ) is very very alien to me at times . 
   and a strange o ( which i think is found in hungarian but i do n't know which one is it because hungarian has too many o 's ) it 's actually written as `` a ''  some of the features of the dialect are exemplified : [ main transylvanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_varieties_of_romanian ) , [ maramure\u015f subdialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maramure%c8%99_subdialect_of_romanian ) and [ cri\u015fana subdialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cri%c8%99ana_subdialect_of_romanian ) . 
  and yes , a lot of dialectal features as well as regional vocabulary are due to hungarian ( and to a way lesser extent german ) influence . 
  `` ni '' for example is the imperative `` n\u00e9 '' from the hungarian verb `` n\u00e9zni '' ( to look ) . 
   we say `` no '' which is an interjection that basically means everything . 
  ( it 's not a negation ) exemplified : http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/na#hungarian ps . 
  speaker of cri\u015fan-light myself ( as well as [ working class mure\u015f szekler-hungarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx08agqhsmg ) ) . 
  it is generally taken that albanian comes from illyrian which was related to dacian , both being paleo-balkan . 
  still , slavic languages have had way more lexical influence than the paleo-balkan substrate . 
  a similar thread from about a year ago : * [ european redditors , how many of you speak a local dialect as your native language ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ynd8p/european_redditors_how_many_of_you_speak_a_local/ ) *, 
  i assume it 's as you say , but my problem is that this visualization is misleading . 
  not everybody has the time to debug the logic behind it , so a quick impression is that hungarian is closer to latvian than german and albanian is halfway between romanian and slovene . 
  therefore it 's basically a useless visualization . 
   hungarian is far away from everything else . 
  but it 's closer to german ( having borrowed from it due to proximity ) than it is to latvian , which was my point .

  please make a comment on their round-up rather than making a new top level post . 
  to reduce clutter . 
  now explain why latvian is halfway between hungarian and german . 
  finnish , estonian and hungarian are non-indo-european and yet they are featured . 
  maltese could have just as well been featured . 
   someone might correct me on this , but there 's a heavy ukrainian cultural influence in northeastern romania and moldova especially . 
  i always made ukrainian decorated eggs [ 1 ] for easter when i was a kid ; when i moved to romania i found out that they do the same thing yes we do share a lot of similar cultural elements with our neighbors , especially with our slavic neighbors . 
   but i 've been told that there 's the balkan influence on romanian is understated because that region tends to have negative connotations . 
  it 's not the balkan influence as much as the slavic influence which is minimized , due to our national identity focusing on the latin aspect of our language ( `` an island of latinity in a sea of slavs '' ) . 
  we do n't have problems with paleo-balkan influences , such as the [ schprachbund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sprachbund ) ( since we consider the dacians our ancestors , and they were paleo-balkans , we tend to exagerate it , especially when it comes to vocabulary ) , nor do we have problems with greek or turkic/ottoman influences . 
  we do n't like the `` balkan '' label though , but more on the political front , not on the linguistic front . 
   s/he he, 
   laws have a context exactly why the entire history of slavery need not to be included in the law . 
  this is a french law , no ? 
  what part did france play in the maghrebian slave trade ? 
   i posted it last week but the mods did n't turn it into a sticky that was because of the survey . 
  one can only have one sticky at a time . 
  as someone pointed out over at / r/linguistics , this is probably because of the immense latin influence on albanian , not vice-versa . 
  also , i too think a lot is off with this diagram, 
  that argument works if we are talking about national elections , just as it does when you talk about local elections ( you ca n't vote for the manchester list if you live in liverpool ) . 
  these are pan-european ones . 
   this is what it mean . 
  i disagree . 
  i do n't think the entire history of slavery needs to be included in the law . 
  i find nothing controversial in the way art . 
  1 is worded , and assuming it means `` only europeans are bad '' is just silly . 
  taubira being an idiot does not make the law inherently bad . 
  my french is rusty . 
  where exactly does the law say that * `` slavery was only done by white people and not by blacks and arabs '' * ?
