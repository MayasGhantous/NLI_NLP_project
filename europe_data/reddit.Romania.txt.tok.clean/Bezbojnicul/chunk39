  from the article you cite , it seems that that is inferred from article 1 of the law . 
  it seems like that 's a pretty big jump , but i 'll let others judge :  ** art . 
  1 ** the french republic recognizes that the transatlantic slave trade and the slave trade in the indian ocean on one side , and slavery on the other hand , starting from the 15 ^ th century , in the americas and the caribbean , in the indian ocean and europe against the african , amerindian , malagasy and indian populations constitute a crime against humanity . 
  it seems that this `` european slave trade was bad '' is interpreted by some as `` only europeans traded slaves , and therefore only europeans did bad '' . 
  otoh taubira does seem a bit of a douche  christiane taubira bluntly states should not too mention the arab-muslim slave trade that `` young arabs '' `` do not carry on their backs the weight of the legacy harm arabs . '', 
  * facepalm *, 
  they do n't claim the entirety of france , so your comparison is ridiculous . 
   admit it as a member state , and will be polite about it spain - will remain part of the eu and will probably veto catalonia 's accession . 
   where socialists made a law that said slavery was only done by white people and not by blacks and arabs ( i wish i was kidding ) care to link to said law ? 
  i was thinking of voting for pnl ( i think renate weber has done a good job , and they actually tend to vote ideologically ) but i heard they are considering running on a common list with the social-democrats , and * really * makes me reconsider the issue . 
  the other parties do n't appeal either ... 
  enjoy your new flair !, 
  d'ya like dags ? 
   also , anti-semitism is n't racist , because it 's criticizing a religion , not a homogenous ethnic group . 
  i think you forgot the \u201e / s '' ... ^ ^ ^ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisemitism, 
  it really depends . 
  a lot of times people just think that roma that do n't fit the \u201e gypsy stereotype '' are just \u201e darker skinned romanians '' . 
  while [ damian dr\u0103ghici ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=damian+draghici&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c2avsx_enro398ro473&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=uyvfuuukbirisga9syggaw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=684 ) does really stand out , others , such as [ m\u0103d\u0103lin voicu ] ( http://media.realitatea.ro/multimedia/image/201110/w728/madalin_voicu_17705700.jpg ) , or the [ kids from this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t253fh_mju ) could easily pass as gadje . 
  post the question ( s ) over at / r/askeurope as well . 
  the first thing after reading the question was to check if the one asking is romanian . 
  ( so yeah , it 's common here ), 
   to use one example , a lot of britons find the manner of speech used in many areas of the continent abrupt to the point of rudeness a lot of transylvanian romanians find the manner of speech used in southern romania ( especially bucharest ) abrupt to the point of rudeness differences such as these exist within countries as well . 
   however , i doubt there 's enough common ground in attitudes and linguistics in particular [ ... ] for a single state to be a workable option . 
  the swiss have little linguistic common ground , but what they do have is a shared sense of \u201e commonness '' . 
  a shared sense of identity . 
  a linguistically and culturally heterogeneous population can still share a sense of common identity . 
  we just need a shared \u201e narrative '' . 
  not a swede/in sweden , but i like how it sounds too . 
  interesting . 
  can confirm . 
  even a lot of people who are skeptical of the eu see it as the lesser evil , when compared to riding solo . 
   slightly misleading title ; all german taxpayers are paying . 
  it has nothing to do with berlin , except that the politicians work there . 
  it 's a typical example of [ ** metonymy ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metonymy ) .

  my pleasure, 
   could this be a result of the war and destruction in chechnya ? 
  yes . 
  first chechen war was overwhelmingly nationalist ( chechen nationalism vs russian nationalism ) . 
  it 's only during the second chechen war that the conflict took a strong religious character . 
  see [ this / r/askhistorians comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1dxxob/wednesday_ama_chechnya/c9ux204?context=1 ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1coy23/in_wake_of_boston_attacks_what_past_relations/c9jofgo?context=1 ) . 
  we can work something out . 
  come by my office later , we 'll iron out the details . 
  goodbye . 
   because you 're shitty little russophobe cia fanboys ( you all look similar to me ! ), 
   go ahead , morons please refrain from using this kind of language . 
  you can argue over numbers and politics all you want , but do so in a civilized manner . 
  otherwise you 'll be leaving us soon . 
  can confirm . 
  do n't go around in public with big smile on your face in eastern europe . 
  i can get you a flair if you want . 
   however , people who are pro euro do not seem to want to admit how badly constructed the euro is . 
  or , how to act . 
  actually , both pro- and anti-euro people agree on the problem ( you ca n't have monetary union and political disunion ) . 
  what they do n't agree on is the solution . 
  pro-euro people see the problem and say that the euro should stay , and the politics should change ( towards more political unity ) . 
  anti-euro people see the same problem , but they do n't want more political unity because , for example , they value national sovereignty . 
  so their solution is is to break up the euro . 
  we 're stuck in limbo not because pro-euro people are ignoring things , as euro-skeptics like to argue , but because people really are conflicted about the issue . 
  europeans value both national sovereignty and the euro , and choosing between the two , irregardless of the outcome , is gon na hit a lot of people hard . 
   with no prior information about the issue , he would form a very biased opinion . 
  while i agree with the general sentiment of your point , i have to point out that the historical context is mostly irrelevant when judging acts such as these . 
  willful destruction of a minority 's heritage is wrong , irregardless whether the majority holds a grudge from a century ago , or from a decade ago . 
  why i also hate is that drawing up a `` comparison '' such as this , is that `` better than milosevic 's serbia '' is really a low standard of comparison , and i think kosovo ( or kosovars ) should holds itself to a higher standard than that , especially because it was on the receiving end not so long ago, 
   the issue of kosovo has nothing to do with islam really turning this whole serbia/kosovo thing into a west/christianity vs. islam thing is so freakin ' ignorant . 
  it 's nationalism pure and simple , with religion being totally secondary in this whole issue . 
  why ? 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  here ya go : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odcp5yin1m0, 
   e : is it just my welsh flag that 's not showing up , or is my internet being a pain again ... 
  it 's not showing , although the `` grant flair '' menu shows you as having flair . 
  weird . 
  a lot of their things are just the same , but they like to pretend it 's not . 
  and san marino ... 
  i do n't think so . 
  they are n't like transylvanian hungarians . 
  although they speak hungarian as a mother tongue ( most of them at least ) , they usually identify as ethnic romanians , and their main identity is that of roman catholics . 
  they kinda missed the age of nationalism , and they still identify mainly by their religion . 
  there is a great hungarian language documentary about them on youtube , but unfortunately it has no english or romanian subtitles . 
  udmr does n't relly appeal to them , as they do n't feel `` ethnic hungarians '' . 
  there might be `` cultural organisations '' though ( found [ this ] ( http://www.keresztszulok.hu/english.html ) with a quick googling ), 
  regarding szeklerland : there are 3 ethnic hungarian parties , and all 3 support autonomy for szeklerland , it 's just the tone differs . 
  udmr being the largest by far , and the most moderate , i 'm gon na talk about them . 
  they have : representation in the [ national parliament ( ~ 5 % ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_legislative_election,_2012 ) , representation on local level , dominating both town/comune councils and the county councils of [ harghita ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/alegeri_locale_%c3%aen_rom%c3%a2nia,_2012#jude.c8.9bul_harghita ) and [ covasna ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/alegeri_locale_%c3%aen_rom%c3%a2nia,_2012#jude.c8.9bul_covasna ) counties . 
  they also have meps . 
  otoh , unlike the hungarian civic party and the hungarian people 's party of transylvania , which both strongly focus on the issue of autonomy , the democratic union of hungarians from romania has a much bigger platform , and local autonomy is just one of many issues they campaign around . 
  [ gra\u017ei\u0161kiai , lithuania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/graziskiai_coa.gif ) from [ what i found ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/heraldry/comments/10w5wh/coa_of_the_town_of_gra%c5%bei%c5%a1kiai_lithuania/c6h6cwd ) :  basically it 's the only town that still has a kind of role-playing mardi gras festival and they put the main character of the play on the town coa . 
  belgium , liege specifically . 
  it felt unnervingly eastern european , like they just existed communism at the same time as us . 
  it had a grey , post-industrial vibe to it that i never expected to find in western europe .

  [ something very similar about endangered languages in new york ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/nyregion/29lost.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ), 
   armenia is in a similar situation to ukraine as far as russia is concerned . 
  armenia said , a couple of weeks before vilnius , that they will join the customs union . 
  they need russia to look out for them in case things heat up with azerbaijan .
