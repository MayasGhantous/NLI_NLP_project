  i 'm ambivalent when it comes to the population issue . 
  but that 's secondary to the fulfillment of the aquis communitaire and the disengagement from cyprus . 
  that being said , next time search through past threads , to see if your question has n't come up already . 
  turkey is secular . 
  but secular does not mean that religion wo n't show up in politics ( a evident from the us ) .

  also , this turkey-in-the_eu discussion comes up almost every time some ( negative ) news concerning turkey pops up on / r/europe frontpage . 
  maybe this question should be directed towards / r/askeurope in the future . 
  idk ... 
  very interesting !, 
   there are n't any dialects in daco-romanian ( aka romanian ) . 
  but even if we accept that view , \u201e romanian '' is composed of 4 dialects , daco-romanian being just one of them , the one with the most speakers and prestige . 
  we kinda do , but since it 's very subjective * and * kinda political , i wo n't push it . 
   we seem to be discussing degrees of influence . 
  yes . 
  what you said initially falls in the \u201e high degree of influence '' . 
   i was n't implying a southern european was like an alien from out of space to another northern european , although i understand your `` rhetorical '' need for such polarization . 
  i did n't say you were . 
   simple mannerisms in speech are enough to make minor cultural changes in any given region in terms of emotional predisposition . 
  [ citation needed ]  in certain cultures or tribes , they can perceive colors we ca n't because we have not named them . 
  they perceive the same spectrum of colors , they just group the hues diferently . 
  \u201e colors '' are just arbitrary divisions of the \u201e visible spectrum '' , not objective categories . 
  you make it sound as if the moment one has a name for \u201e ultra-violet '' one starts to see into the ultra-violet spectrum . 
   using more collective nouns instead of individual ones has political weight and is used politically , such as in the ussr who downplayed individuality in nearly all written forms . 
  i 'm not sure what point you 're trying to make . 
  that eastern europe became less individualistic because for 45 years everybody called everybody else \u201e comrade '' ? 
  it shapes it to a quite small extent ( weak whorfianism ) . 
  it does not make you more prone to risk taking , more logical or more emotional . 
   you see , language is closely tied to emotional traits and even logic . 
  english speakers are more prone to risk taking than portuguese speakers . 
  this is flat out false . 
  [ strong whorfianism ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/histlingfaq#wiki_linguistic_relativity ) has been discredited by research . 
   but obviously she does not claim santa claus to be real . 
  and obviously i took the possibility of it not being entirely serious into consideration . 
  i said :  not sure if serious bad linguistics , * or joke . 
  that ( research on how people group words ) is still light years away from \u201e finnish makes you punctual and egalitarian '' . 
  my link states language having some influence on perception is not totally false , but the extent is extremely exaggerated . 
  those articles fall within the * weak whorfianism * category , while the claims above regarding finnish are of the * hard whorfianism * kind . 
  think about it this way : if non-gendered pronouns make you egalitarian , than finland should be noticeably more egalitarian than sweden , and hungarian more egalitarian than slovakia . 
  are they ? 
  i speak a finno-ugric language as well , so i know what you mean , especially since i 'm trying to teach it to my so . 
   anyways , the point i believe sofi was making is that languages have value in their self and loosing living languages is every time a loss . 
  i agree with the point . 
  my big issue is with the second phrase , tbh . 
   other finno-ugric languages have fared poorly over a broad geographic area , most especially in russia , and many of these languages , not to mention their literatures , have already died or are threatened thanks to colonization , which has been the fate of so many other indigenous peoples . 
  [ map of finno-ugric languages ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/lenguas_finougrias.png ), 
  had the same reaction when i saw [ this chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#classification ) some time ago . 
  also , when i found out the fact that turkish makes up [ almost half of the speakers of turkic languages ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/turkiclanguages.png ), 
  that 's better , but the part about language \u201e influencing reality '' making you egalitarian and punctual is still [ pretty much false ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/histlingfaq#wiki_linguistic_relativity ) . 
   and if there were no books in this language , no one would ever have wondered , for instance , whether personal pronouns need not specify gender . 
  this is [ by no means unique to finnish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#overview ) , and people could still have wondered about that even in the absence of finnish . 
   innish and estonian have got along very well without gender-specific pronouns , and that may have had something to do with our egalitarianism , ** since language creates reality . 
  ** and perhaps the finns are known for their punctuality because their present and future take the same verb form . 
  this is known as the [ sapir-whorf hypothesis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_relativity ) , and , while popular irl , it does n't stand up to scientific scrutiny , except for some very-very weak correlations . 
  the language you speak does not make you more punctual , or more egalitarian , or anything , or give you a better work ethic .

  not sure if serious bad linguistics , or joke . 
  yeah , but your comment made it seem as if it 's * objectively * one of the hardest languages to learn . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's something entirely subjective . 
   and epp are never ( in my view ) going to expel them . 
  interesting . 
  what makes you say that ? 
   i 'm from carei which is even closer to the border than oradea so it was worth it to some people to make the commute . 
  it 's the same here with the houses and the commute , as the difference from carei is n't that big ( looked on google maps : carei ~ 9km from border vs. oradea ~ 15km ), 
   sometimes i go shopping as well . 
  this used to be so big a decade ago . 
  i live in oradea , and shopping in berettyoujfalu or debrecen was extremely common ( still is but to a lesser extent ) . 
  also , a lot of people go to hospital to debrecen , because it 's better . 
  otoh , another aspect is that `` former border guard '' is a category of people who have larger houses than you 'd expect from their salary . 
  wonder why ... 
   so they agree on 3-6 of the 10 founding principles . 
  i do n't think they would be a good fit . 
  question is whether it 's a better or worse fit than with the [ epp principles ] ( http://www.epp.eu/policy-areas ) ? 
  cause they do n't feel like they fit there either , and given their stance towards the eu , they feel more ecr than epp tbh . 
  this is n't about freedom of speech . 
  it 's about '' [ guilty until proven innocent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presumption_of_innocence ) '' . 
  really now ... 
  it 's the third link in the / r/europe queue at the moment . 
  i really wonder why fidesz has n't joined ecr in the ep . 
  they seem closer to them ideologically . 
   another counter-activity against the `` macedonian '' action is the possible renaming of blagoevgrad to samuilgrad or city of tsar samuil i got curious about the city name , given that cities tend to not want to change names , but i see why this one would maybe welcome it ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blagoevgrad  the town was renamed blagoevgrad in 1950 after the founder of the bulgarian communist party , dimitar blagoev , a refugee from aegean macedonia . 
  [ for your viewing pleasure ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5sprouu.jpg ), 
  ... for a speaker of an indo-european language . 
  born in romania , half the family is ethnic romanian , half szekler hungarian , with some other ethnicities ( italian , armenian , greek ... who knows what else ) up and down the family tree , but those had little direct effect . 
  spent the first years of my life , as well as all my holidays at my szekler grandparents , but went to romanian school . 
  as such , the romanian high culture is more prevalent ( little hungarian high culture , more of a regional identity in that respect ) , and for brevity 's sake i identify as romanian , but i feel inbetween . 
  people like me are called `` fele-fele '' here ( `` half-half '' in hungarian ) and i think it 's the closest label to how i actually feel .
