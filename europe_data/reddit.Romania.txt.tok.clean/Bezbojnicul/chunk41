  view from this side of the fence is a bit different than from the western front . 
  for romanians it was the war that gave them their greatest achievement : the unification of all romanian speaking provinces into `` greater romania '' , their greatest national project . 
  even now , when some of those provinces are no longer romania 's , the national day is `` unification day '' , commemorating the great national gathering at alba-iulia , when the representatives of the romanians in hungary voted for [ union with the kingdom of romania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/romania_territory_during_20th_century.gif ) . 
  otoh , for hungary it 's one of their national tragedies ( the peace talks that followed wwi ) , on par with the destruction brought on by the ottoman conquest . 
  they lost , and they lost a lot , including a buttload of ethnic hungarians and [ 70-something % of their territory ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/trianon_consequences.png ) . 
  man this title sucks . 
  maybe a map of `` stop posting maps '' in different european languages ? 
  damn , til . 
  afaik , it 's `` angyalka '' ( little angel ) that brings gifts to hungarians , not `` j\u00e9zuska '' ( little jesus ) . 
  man , things sure are pagan up north , with them goats and gnomes ... 
  old church slavonic ... sort of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic_in_romania  the language , while based on old church slavonic , was influenced by the slavic languages used by surrounding peoples . 
  the most important influences were from middle and modern bulgarian , with some smaller influences from serbian ( in wallachia ) and russian ( in moldavia ) . 
  starting with the 15th century , the language was also influenced by romanian . 
  but the [ russian church slavonic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_church_slavonic ) article mentiones romania as well , so now i 'm not so sure . 
  well , we did have significant cultural interactions in the 18th-19th centuries , including an [ ethnic greek minority ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeks_in_romania ) , ethnic [ greek rulers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanariotes ) , as well as well as greek being the second language of high culture after slavonic . 
  all this happened in more strongly in the south of romania , which is the culturally dominant area since the capital is there . 
  on a side-note : one side of my family is from [ a city with a strong greek historical minority ] ( http://www.hfc.gr/wmt/webpages/index.php?lid=2&amp;pid=34&amp;apprec=170 ) , so there are a lot of greek things up and down my family tree   all other languages use ancient greek roots to make their vocabulary . 
  we do too . 
  actually , i found out that there are crazy strands of calvinism when i found out that the wbc is `` calvinist fundamentalist '' and started reading about it . 
  the hungarian calvinists are pretty light . 
  no different from the roman catholics . 
  fun fact : in romanian , the word `` hellas '' ( also spelled `` helas '' ) has come to mean [ a sort of artificial lemon concentrate/juice ] ( http://www.multivit.ro/what_new_lemon_hellas.html ) ^ [ [ img ] ( http://www.lemondressing.gr/greek/media/products/16.jpg ) ] otoh we do have `` elada '' as a fancy alternative to `` grecia '' . 
  i was quoting the wiktionary link provided above ( which you can probably edit if you wsh ) . 
  wikipedia says that oporto is a valid english version of porto , albeit used less frequently than porto . 
  i have taken note of the info you provided , and will use the `` porto '' version , but for the love of god , do n't be so dramatic about it . 
   on a side-note : there are other examples of situations where the name of a city in a language incorporates the definite article of the name in the source language . 
   the modern name '' \u0130zmir '' derives from the former greek name \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7 `` smyrna '' , through the first two syllables of the phrase '' \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd '' ( pronounced `` is smirnin '' ) , which means `` to smyrna '' in greek . 
  a similar etymology also applies for other turkish cities with former greek names , such as \u0130znik ( from the phrase `` is nikaean '' , meaning `` to nicaea '' ) , istanbul ( from the phrase `` is tan polin '' or `` to the city '' ) or even for the greek island of kos , called '' \u0130stank\u00f6y '' in turkish .

  apparently , it 's ** ureno ** in swahili ( which apparently comes from portuguese '' * o reino * '' - `` the kingdom '' ) and ** lus\u00edit\u00e1an ** in yucatec maya . 
  other than that , they all seem to derive more or less from the latin `` portus cale '' , former name of what is now the city of oporto . 
  see [ here ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/portugal ) click [ show ] on the right side of the ** translations ** subsection . 
  my pleasure , 
   we always pronounce ' \u03b2 ' as ` v ' . 
  in any dialect . 
  except when you did n't  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beta  * in ancient greek , beta represented the voiced bilabial plosive / b / .

  and afaik ferries go every 15 minutes ? 
  how long does it take for the ferry to make the ride ? 
  this is interesting ... 
   also , can we pleeeeaaaase stop responding to daily mail bullshit ? 
  keep in mind that the issue has gotten to the point where the romanian ambassador has to respond to this bullshit . 
  but core vocabulary is germanic , and that 's the most used part when it comes to simple things .

  then who will do my accounting ? 
  i had a highschool classmate from republic of moldova .

  to ad to the lega nord comments : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_tyrol  south tyrol is granted a considerable level of self-government , consisting of a large range of exclusive legislative powers and a fiscal regime that allows the province to retain 90 % of most levied taxes . 
   i respect that you call like a hundred very distinct dialects the same language ( even if linguists are a bit sceptical about it ) . 
  linguists are not `` skeptical '' . 
  the know full well that the distinction between dialect and separate language can be fuzzy at times , and often dependent on politics / people 's self-identifications . 
  if catalans tomorrow insisted that catalan is just a dialect of spanish , linguists would treat castilian and catalan as 2 very distinct dialects of `` spanish '' ( just as they do with chinese and arabic ) . 
  if valencians would insist that valencians speak a different language than catalan ( i know some do insist ) , than linguists would treat them as 2 very simmilar languages ( as is the case with serbian and croatian ... and bosnian ... and montenegrin ) . 
  i see . 
  so what would they be risking here ? 
  jail , or just fines ? 
  there are other factors at play , no doubt . 
  a `` sustainability clause '' would probably be recommended . 
  for example an `` inside-schengen vs. outside-schengen '' distinction should be made . 
  a spanish enclave in barcelona would not be a big administrative problem . 
  a morroccan enclave would mean erecting a border , so it 's a bigger hastle from the get go . 
  so you do have to strike a balance between the greater good and the individual wishes of the secessionists . 
  obviously catalonia is in a different ballpark than your examples . 
   the rights granted to us citizens at least are pretty clear and have been hashed out in fine detail . 
  they have been hashed out in fine detail because of 200 years of court cases regarding the limits and applicability of said rights . 
  and people still have long fuckin debates over them . 
  the us bill of rights has its fair share of vagueness . 
  way to miss the point . 
   the constitution clearly states as i have said in another post that while it recognizes the right of self-goverment , spain is indissoluble.that 's why the referendum is illegal right now .
