  if the referendum is non-binding ( consultative ) than it would n't be illegal , just unimplementable ( until a constitutional change is made ) . 
  so my question is : is the referendum binding ? 
  existing human rights are just as vague ( intentionally so , i 'd say ) . 
  `` right to life '' ? 
  when does life begin ? 
  `` freedom of speech '' ? 
  where that ends is subject to debate : `` freedom to cry fire in a theatre '' ? , usa free-speech vs european free-speech . 
  `` freedom of religion '' ? 
  some western countries ban dangerous cults , while the us does not . 
   imagine every little county in your country seeking independence i do n't think europe is that scared of slippery slope arguments . 
   where do you draw the line ? 
  just because there is no clear boundary does n't mean one can not set one depending on numerous factors , on a case-by-case basis . 
   ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ county of cluj . 
  cluj is central-western . 
  they are autonomist , not secessionist . 
  there are [ greek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griko ) and [ albanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arb%c3%abresh_language ) speakers in italy 's south . 
   but wikpedia says that they 're 83.7 % belarusians being ethnic belarussian does n't mean automatically that belarussian is your main language . 
  see ireland for a simmilar situation . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarusian_language  according to a study done by the belarusian government in 2009 , 72 % of belarusians speak russian at home , while belarusian is used by only 11.9 % of belarusians . 
  29.4 % of belarusians can write , speak , and read belarusian , while 52.5 % can only read and speak it . 
  according to the research , one out of ten belarusians does not understand belarusian . 
   fun fact , you killed 25.3 % of the population of belarus in ww2 wat ? 
  a very good design imo . 
  common in the former austro-hungarian empire as well ( hungarian , transylvanian dialects of romanian , etc. ), 
  i call this cheating . 
  i clearly hear [ \u0268 ] in there . 
  as in [ v ** \u0268 ** rt ], 
  please establish in an urgent manner an exceptional mechanism of reevaluation of romania 's compliance with the copenhagen criteria , as well as with the other commitments it undertook as an eu member state , and apply credible penalties in the event of failure to comply . 
  possible pealties could be the suspension of voting rights in the council and/or access to european funds . 
  we ask you to establish a new mechanism , adittional to the verification and cooperation mechanism that ensures the preservation of the rule of law for each of its members , as the foundation of the european construction . 
  romania proved in these months that compliance with the copenhagen criteria is not irreversible after accession . 
   http://lobbyplag.eu/map/countries/ro damn , i am dissapoint !, 
   most are extremely religious judging by the constant `` allahu akbar '' in response to everything in these videos afaik `` allahu akbar '' is just a catch all phrase in arab societies which can be used in a lot of contexts , and it does n't really meany that everybody saying it does so with religion in mind . 
  it does have religious origins , but then again , so does `` oh my god ! '', 
  and `` jesus christ ! '', 
  and variations thereof . 
  [ szeklerland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kely_autonomy_initiatives ) does have some support when it comes to autonomy ( [ they did have a large human-chain-type protest recently ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ethnic-hungarians-in-romania-seek-greater-autonomy ) ) . 
  but independence not so much right now , although things could change in the next couple of decades . 
  / u/ribsduff has a couple more albums in his comments/submissions . 
   and people are stupid and think roma/gypsy come from there or something . 
  well , some do come from here . 
  some do n't . 
  but yeah . 
  people who think all romanians are roma are indeed stupid . 
   do n't know the difference between roma/gypsies and ~ ~ real ~ ~ * ethnic * romanians fixed . 
   and if these are the opinions of young , twenty-something people that are somewhat educated and forward thinking problem is that the vocal minority tends to stand out more than the average joe , and it gives out a skewed image . 
  kinda like the comment section of online news . 
  it 's not about caring for us , as it is for their own electorate . 
  and it 's in the interest of their own electorate to help improve romania judicially , since we 're all in this eu boat together . 
  actually that is the most surprising thing in this . 
  ignoring the fact that all the numbers seem high to me , the german thing is simply weird . 
  most , if not all , have an extremely good opinion of germans . 
  as i pointed out in [ a previous discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1s2auf/roma_in_sweden_a_nation_questions_itself_bbc_news/cdt9zlb ) , urban poverty and rural poverty are demonstrably two different beasts . 
  http://udini.proquest.com/view/rurality-and-crime-identifying-and-pqid:1981309941/ relevant bit  * while there is a large body of research examining crime in urban areas , far less attention has been given to rural crime . 
  there is reason to expect rural crime to be different from that in urban areas ; rural and urban places differ on a variety of characteristics -- demographic , economic , structural , and social -- that are known to be correlated with crime . 
  unfortunately , there have been relatively few systematic examinations of rural-urban differences in crime rates . 
  although they are few , existing studies show a fairly consistent pattern ; urban areas generally have higher crime rates than do rural areas , supporting the assertion that there are important differences between rural and urban places . 
  findings of lower rural crime rates date back to the beginning of the 20 ^ th century * [ sic ! ], 
  * ( see krohn , lanza-kaduce , and akers 1984 ) , when researchers were concerned with the effects of urbanization and suggested that urban areas fostered crime . 
  research consistently found that urban places have higher crime rates than rural places , as shown in quinney ` s ( 1966 ) study using national data from the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) on offenses known to police ( from 1960 - 1961 ) . 
   i always think : thank god i do n't have to learn romanian instead . 
  yep . 
  [ take the plurals for example ] ( http://mylanguages.org/romanian_grammar.php ) . 
  according to the [ official press release ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qx0krwx.jpg ) , they were : * antoine le quinio , 22 y.o.

  the far-right in 1930s-1940s romania was a mix of mystical orthodox christianity and nationalism . 
  and they were involved in terrorist acts , no less . 
   the notion that islam is somehow unique or ushering some kind of foreign influence is nonsensical here . 
  a [ fresh study on romania ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mediafax.ro%2fsocial%2fstudiu-majoritatea-romanilor-n-ar-vota-o-femeie-presedinte-si-nu-ar-vrea-un-homosexual-in-familie-11754398 ) :  romanians would not accept into the family ...  60 % - a person with a different sexual orientation  58 % - a roma  54 % - a black person  52 % - a hungarian or an immigrants  50 % - a person infected with hiv/aids or a jew  46 % - a german  44 % - a person with disabilities  42 % - a person of another religion or a chronic disease  36 % - a person with no income,

  wow . 
  the difference is strong . 
   ** that ** 's been disproven over the past few years . 
  what ? 
  the fact that kids brains are wired a certain way up to a certain age ? 
  your answer is a bit vague , and it might seem that you 're only lowering the age limit from 10 to 18 . 
  ** l.e. 
  ** found [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/18bnvm/why_is_it_impossible_to_achieve_native_speaking/c8dn56o ) which i suspect is what you were refering to , innit ? 
  it 's not only about free time .

  otoh , about half the states do , sometimes more than one . 
  just saying . 
  this is the first time i actually read news from kabardino-balkaria . 
  more interesting than was expecting , tbh . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_dream  czech dream ( czech : \u010cesk\u00fd sen ) is a documentary film directed by two young czech directors : v\u00edt klus\u00e1k and filip remunda . 
  the film was released in february 2004 . 
  it recorded a large-scale hoax perpetrated by klus\u00e1k and remunda on the czech public , culminating in the `` opening event '' of a fake hypermarket . 
  when the hoax was revealed at the `` opening day '' and eager shoppers found out , some started blaming the eu . 
  it 's worth watching , btw . 
   the french from , say , normandy , and those from the southern coast are ridiculously different , but they all agree they 're similar enough to be both french . 
  it 's not that much of a bad thing to have regional differences . 
  you do n't need to be near identical culturally , ethnically , historically , to form a nation . 
  true . 
  it 's more about self-perception than objective cultural similarity . 
   ) good one, 
  to be fair , oa\u015f country , and certeze specifically , are in a league of their own , even by romanian standards . 
  the hydra version would be a fitting permanent replacement . 
  there are 2 eids actually : eid al-adha , aka kurban bayram in turkish , which wiki says is in october this year and eid al-fitr , aka ramazan bayram ( end of ramadan ) , which wiki says was in august this year .
