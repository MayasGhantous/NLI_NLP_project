  i bet the turkish names are more familiar ( they make the news each year since we have a small turkish + tatar muslim comunity ) . 
   i read in a newspaper once that there is a new anti-corruption force in romania that uncovers a lot of dirt , but that some politicians remain almost untouched and continue their careers despite convictions of corruption . 
  [ probably this ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qga99/romanias_anticorruption_agency_keeps_taking_down/ )  it is because the agency is seen as political herself partially ( but that still does n't mean people think the convicted are innocent ) . 
  but most people just have short memories / do n't actually give that much of a fuck . 
   or the prolonged arm of the eu meddling in local affairs . 
  actually , most people [ trust ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/adevarul-despre-romania-sondaj-doar-348-romani-mai-incredere-guvernul-ponta-1_52558850c7b855ff561b1947/index.html ) the eu more than national institutions . 
  well , they will probably appeal , then appeal again and hopefully , get a final conviction from the supreme court . 
  then they will do time , and after that , idk . 
  maybe return to politics ... or not , who knows . 
  they were out of the game for a while now anyway .

  not sure if this is the case , but i do n't think we should respond in a putinesque manner , tbh . 
   i guess there is some truth in the stories i see europeans telling about gypsies . 
  any good stereotype has some truth at its heart ( roma and criminality , jews and banking , you name it ) . 
  it 's just a formulation of a complex issue in a simplistic generalizing way that 's the problem here . 
  thanks for the answer . 
   i believe the title is in hungarian and is about norway it 's `` gypsies in norway '', 
   so romas will forever be referred to as romanians but they wo n't be the only ones being referred to as `` romanians '' , so you equating the two will still be wrong . 
  because , you know , ethnic romanians are capable of crime too , and will get lumped together within those statistics . 
  afaik , urban poverty correlates with higher levels of criminality than rural poverty in other , more homogenous countries as well . 
  that might be a factor . 
  found this study om a quick google search : http://udini.proquest.com/view/rurality-and-crime-identifying-and-pqid:1981309941/ relevant bit  * while there is a large body of research examining crime in urban areas , far less attention has been given to rural crime . 
  there is reason to expect rural crime to be different from that in urban areas ; rural and urban places differ on a variety of characteristics -- demographic , economic , structural , and social -- that are known to be correlated with crime . 
  unfortunately , there have been relatively few systematic examinations of rural-urban differences in crime rates . 
  although they are few , existing studies show a fairly consistent pattern ; urban areas generally have higher crime rates than do rural areas , supporting the assertion that there are important differences between rural and urban places . 
  findings of lower rural crime rates date back to the beginning of the 20 ^ th century * [ sic ! ], 
  * ( see krohn , lanza-kaduce , and akers 1984 ) , when researchers were concerned with the effects of urbanization and suggested that urban areas fostered crime . 
  research consistently found that urban places have higher crime rates than rural places , as shown in quinney ` s ( 1966 ) study using national data from the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) on offenses known to police ( from 1960 - 1961 ) . 
   poverty in france [ 1 ] found [ a nice little blogpost with maps about crime in france ] ( http://meridianes.org/2012/12/09/cartographie-de-la-criminalite-en-france/ ) . 
  i 'll let others judge how well it correlates with your map . 
  now you have to prove that virtually all of those romanian nationals were of roma ethnicity . 
  roma - an ethnicity romanian - an ethnicity , but also a citizenship ( aka nationality ) so a roma from romania will be referred to as `` romanian '' because they are citizens of romania , and newspapers usually refer to citizenship , rather then ethnicity . 
  that 's why `` morrocan '' is often used , but `` berber '' quite seldom . 
  that still does n't mean that all `` romanian crime '' is exclusively roma , or that ethnic roma all come from romania , or that the two ethnicities are the same , or whatever point / u/neredev is trying to make .

  for people who 's national identity is intimately tied to a language , the non-linguistic national identities can be a bit confusing . 
  some context :  the census system in hungary between 1880 and 1910 was based on native language . 
  as such , hungarian speaking jews and gypsies got counted as \u201e hungarians '' . 
  this bumped the numbers up a bit .
