   romanians belived that they were going to be incorporated into europe for their living standards to be increased at least to those of greece . 
  in fact , they were incorporated into europe to decrease living standards of greece to equal romania 's . 
  both have happened . 
  romania 's living standard went up , greece 's went down . 
  romania 's economy is not static after all . 
  thank you  ever need website language icons ( or anything flag related ) , you have your people call my people , and we work something out . 
  done  anybody else want a flair , just ask away . 
  just remembered i promised to update a flair some time ago , and forgot . 
   where did you get the other flag icons from ( i.e. , the ones not in my link , like roma and sami ) ? 
  did you make them yourself ? 
  they were added by me . 
  made them myself . 
  also . 
  god-mode : 4 . 
  pacific island states, 
  fair enough . 
  but i bet most europeans would suck when confronted with a map of the middle east and central asia . 
  for example . 
  plus there were way fewer countries back then in the east . 
   the british establishment put her in that job on the assumption that , because she was n't ** one of them ** , that she would n't be up to it . 
  * them * who ? 
  it 's a bit ambiguous . 
   the `` languages '' of yugoslavia are n't really all that separate . 
  they 're all the same thing with a bit of variation . 
  linguistically it 's usually considered one language , and a part of a larger dialect continuum . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-croatian keep in mind that macedonian and slovenian were never considered part of serbo-croatian also there is albanian ( because kosovo ) , which is quite different from the slavic ones mentioned above . 
  heads up : this thread covered last week . 
  18-24 november . 
  the thread covering this week will be posted on sunday , around noon...-ish . 
  i should unsticky this post . 
   nobody sat down and decided to coin a new meaning for the word , they just used it ~ ~ wrongly ~ ~ * differently * . 
  fiks 'd, 
  so is `` literally '' . 
  and many others , including `` awful '' iirc . 
  just like `` literally '' . 
  which means both `` literally '' and `` figuratively '' , depending on context . 
  but it 's not * misuse * . 
  it 's a normal process in languages . 
  use dictates meaning . 
   + i think russia cares more about having an avantgarde outpost for it 's army . 
  so a stable outpost would be prefarable to an unstable one it 's unstable from the moldovan/western pov . 
  i do n't think russia views it as `` unstable '' . 
  for russia it 's firmly stable and they are in control there . 
  and as such they can poke at chisinau . 
   i 'm not advocating the border should be the river . 
  but most people who advocate a separation do so on the de jure border , which is the river . 
  de facto separation being somewhat different , it creates some complications for the process . 
   if the population is convinced that independence is the best course of action , then self-governance should always be an available option . 
  while i agree , i was aiming to present the possible arguments of both sides , not my own . 
   it seems a less complicated case than kosovo assuming the majority will run with it , there are still some problems : 1 . 
  certain areas of transnistria are under chisinau 's control - dubasari area - , and some `` moldova proper '' areas are under transnistrian control - namely bender/tighina . 
  i doubt transnitria wants to let go of bender/tighina . 
  a third of transnistrians are romanian-speakers . 
  chisinau is probably hesitant to let them go . 
  russia 's interest is not to create a new state , but to maintain the situation a grey area . 
  separating transnistria from moldova proper means russia lost a foothold over moldova 4 . 
  it might give the gagauz ideas 5 . 
  transnistrian elites probably profit from the grey legal area they are in . 
  smuggling is probably quite lucrative . 
  at least that 's how i see it . 
  i might be wrong . 
  although i do agree getting rid of transnistria will get rid of quite of bit of a headache . 
   but we have no russian minority to speak of . 
  well , we have the lipovan minority ( russian old-believers ) , but they are minuscule and a totally different cup of tea from the `` post-soviet russians '', 
   how would something like that be objectively `` proved useful '' . 
  having another discussion thread or an opinion poll is as objective as we can get . 
  enough time for non-previous-score-influenced-voting . 
  what about / r/trueatheism 's hover caption ? 
   but 1 hour max . 
  i 'd make it less . 
  30 min max ( would prefer 15-20 ) . 
  it 's enough time imo . 
   but to call it a `` downvote culture '' is a bit much . 
  i do think the downvote button is used a bit quickly a lot of times . 
  i 've seen downvoted comments who had nothing offensive in them , besides just being the minority viewpoint . 
  it 's one of the reasons a lot of great users left some time ago . 
   this reddit changed so much in the last year , back then you had so many discussions and nowadays the comments are so void of actual content . 
  a lot of quality posters left because of the influx of racists , a point you keep conveniently ignoring . 
   the eu is flawless said no-one on / r/europe ever . 
   hide the comment score for at least an hour before people are allowed to see what a comment 's score is , for a trial period of a week/month . 
  agreed . 
  two-three weeks seems like a reasonable test interval imho . 
  i think the vote-captions are a great idea and should be implemented . 
  the other two things ( no downvote and score-hiding ) could be implemented temporarily as a test , and kept if they prove useful . 
  there 's a shortage of french people in eastern europe , so we make due with what we can ...

  they sound like they found a lot of inspiration in hungary 's jobbik . 
  whom they probably hate . 
   i 'd say russia 's too culturally distinctive i 'd say they are as culturally distinctive as romania and bulgaria . 
  so basically a lot of today 's old russians got little need for romanian until they were 40-ish ? 
  to be honest it 's hard to learn a new language so late in life ( not impossible though ) . 
  have there been any statistics on romanian language proficienty by age and ethnicity ? 
  i would assume the younger russians/ukrainians are way better at romanian than their older counterparts . 
  just got back from irl  sorry . 
   they live for their entire lives in moldova and do n't know a word in romanian . 
  how much romanian did one need when moldova was still part of the ussr ?
