  could one get by purely by russian ? 
  i know that russia does give de jure protection to minority languages while de facto encouraging linguistic assimilation and russification . 
  was the soviet union the same ? 
   thats just pure pig behavior . 
  the part about * \u201e talk in a human language . '' * abso-fuckin ' - lutely . 
  not knowing the language otoh , it depends . 
  i know people who speak no romanian after a lifetime of living in romania , and have no ill feeling towards the romanian language . 
  they just had little schooling and lived their entire life not really needing the language ( old people , in hungarian majority area ) . 
   does anyone have polls , surveys or analyses of the public opinions ? 
  [ freshest article i could find ] ( http://adevarul.ro/moldova/politica/republica-moldova-uniunea-europeana-uniunea-vamala-preferintele-moldovenilor-1_528dfe9bc7b855ff561f8a69/index.html ) : ** european union **  if next sunday there would be a referendum on joining the european union , 48 % would vote in favor , 34 % - against and 11 % would be undecided  47.1 % of moldovans consider that moldova could gain several benefits after joining the eu , and 38 % have an opposite opinion . 
  14.9 % do not know anything about the advantages or disadvantages  the european union is associated with freedom of movement for work ( 33 % ) , ability to travel ( 28.2 % ) and education ( 26.9 % ) . 
  for 26.9 % the eu is associated with economic prosperity . 
  moldovans are optimistic about the likelihood of visa liberalization with the european union , 46.5 % showed sure that soon we will be able to travel freely . 
   meanwhile , 47.1 % of moldovans consider that moldova could gain several benefits after joining the eu , and 38 % have an opposite opinion . 
  14.9 % do not know anything about the advantages or disadvantages . 
  ** russia-belarus-kazakhstan customs union **  46 % of respondents opted for the republic of moldova to join the customs union ( russia-belarus-kazakhstan ) . 
  they argue that the combination of the customs union will lead to cheaper gas prices and oil ( 38.6 % ) , will allow moldovans to work freely in this space ( 36.5 % ) and the republic of moldova will bring economic prosperity ( 35.9 % )  52 % of respondents believe that moldova could benefit from joining the customs union , while 34 % said the opposite . 
  14 % did not answer . 
   faced with a choice between joining the european union or the customs , 45 % of respondents said they would in the eu and 43 chose the second option . 
   public opinion barometer was conducted during november 6 to 15 , 2013 , on a sample of 1,144 people from 85 towns and villages . 
  the margin of error is plus or minus 3 % . 
  articles about polls seen in the past were equally split when it comes to opinions . 
  otoh i do n't know if there is an trend for increased pro-eu opinions ( i suspect there is , but that 's just a hunch ) . 
  also , i have no idea what 's the political affiliation the maker of this current poll . 
   other than anti-russian jingoism , why is europe so eager to get ukraine ? 
  well , others covered some points , so i 'm going to tell you why romania wants ukraine on the eu-side . 
  ukraine is romania 's northern and eastern ( partially ) neighbour . 
  as such , it wants a friendly and democratic as possible ukraine on its border . 
  having a russian ally on our back is something we do not want . 
  moldova is between ukraine and romania . 
  moldova was once part of romania , and the only way any unification can happen is inside the eu . 
  even if unification does not happen , we still want moldova as close to us as possible . 
  we think it 's both best for us and best for them . 
  having pro-european states on both borders will make a moldova less likely to slip back into the pro-russia camp , as it would be in an `` exclave '' - type situation . 
  same as the above , but for the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria . 
  ukraine in the eu-side would isolate transnistria from russia , and as such will weaken the russian position there ( economically ) . 
  this might hasten a solution to the conflict in a moldova-favorable way ( reintegration ) rather than the opposite ( status-quo or secession ), 
  well fuck !, 
  you should post to / r/europe directly, 
  afaik the greek state has long held that there are no ethnic minorities in greece , only religious minorities ( muslims in thrace basically ) . 
  nope , vlachophone greeks . 
  nope , arvanitik-speaking greeks . 
  slavs ( macedonians slavs , bulgarians , etc ) ? 
  nope , slavophone greeks . 
  i do n't know if this is still official policy , but afaik it 's still a view held by many greeks . 
   a new approach is needed . 
  such as ? 
   i just assumed it was because electricity is too expensive to waste on something frivolous like ice . 
  nope . 
  we like ice as in maximum 1 or 2 cubes . 
  the way mcdonalds fills your cup with 70 % ice and 30 % coke can really grind one 's gears , given how it 's not exactly cheap . 
  if i paid for 500ml coke , i want 500ml coke , not 500ml coke-flavoured ice . 
  also cold drinks are associated with risk of catching cold , so people , especially parents , stay away from ice in drinks . 
  the suspense is killing me !, 
  i 'm surprised no-one mentioned greece . 
  there is `` everything comes from the greeks '' sentiment there that will make you swear that country is the center of the universe . 
  it 's partially justified , and somewhat benign , but not to the extent they think it is . 
  also i find the `` there are no ethnic minorities , we are all greek '' thing to be a bit creepy tbh . 
   in romania the state is actively trying to ingrain nationalism through the use of schooling but the results have been mixed . 
  partially true , but some of the history lessons in school - which is the way the state `` is actively trying to ingrain nationalism '' - are the way they are because of inertia , rather than a deliberate state state policy . 
   one minute you 'll see someone waving a flag and beating their chest , the next that same person will drop the flag , spit on it the most widespread attitude towards the romanian flag is indifference . 
  now compare wages , 
  half of poland is full of `` german cities for over x centuries '' . 
  should they anschluss as well ? 
  and i 'm not even gon na bring up `` the carpathian basin '' . 
   there 's a fairly harmless variant where you are proud of your traditions and your heritage , and you believe in the cultural values that are dominant in that society . 
  i think the harmless thing is when you do n't feel neither ashamed nor proud , but can relate critically to your culture . 
   i was kind of shocked to find out it was the first state visit . 
  me too tbh . 
  5 star treatment i see ... 
  visa restrictions or lack thereof should not be based on ethnic kinship with existing current member states . 
  if the moldovans got visa-free travel , it 's because they did the necessary reforms . 
  not because they are related to a member state . 
  if you like this : / r/borderporn, 
   that said , as far as i know they were not enslaved as they were in romania . 
  parts of today 's romania and what is now rep. of moldova .

   humans are not cheap and take years to grow this sounds so weird , 
  found these on a quick googling : * [ time article from 2010 ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2019316,00.html ) * [ dw - 2013 ] ( http://www.dw.de/facing-long-road-spains-roma-make-strides/a-17095045 ) i remember seing something better not long ago , maybe on / r/europe , but i ca n't find that now . 
  with a mustache like that , no wonder the roma listen to the mayor . 
  jokes aside , i am glad to see news like this . 
  it tastes like heaven when you 're hung over . 
  in romanian as well . 
  after a `` ceau '' / `` servus '' / `` salut '' you can pop in a `` ce faci ? '', 
  if you know the person a bit . 
  saying it to complete strangers is weird though . 
  standard answer is `` bine . '', 
   while in most ( if not all ) of the other latin language its masculine . 
  feminine in romanian too . 
  you have options to merge , cut out and so on using objects . 
  like creating a square , a circle inside it and then using a command you can make the circle cut a circle-shape out of the square . 
  select `` path '' on the upper side , and you have `` union '' , `` difference '' and so on . 
  explained under `` boolean operations '' in [ this link ] ( http://inkscape.org/doc/advanced/tutorial-advanced.html ) . 
  that 's what you 'd need to use , but it 's tricky as the paths on the map are made to overlap in a specific sequence to get the borders right . 
   it would probably also be a good idea for the templates to use masking of only one coloured object per country , instead of doing islands/exclaves/etc separately . 
  this would avoid forgotten parts and make it easier to write scripts to generate maps . 
  but i do n't often use svg/inkscape , so i do n't know how easily that can be done . 
  it would be easier ( i thought about it as well ) but i do n't have the patience to do it as the layers are done to overlap in different ways to get the end result . 
   you could also put it in the wiki [ 1 ] over in our new subreddit , if you do n't mind other people using it as well .
