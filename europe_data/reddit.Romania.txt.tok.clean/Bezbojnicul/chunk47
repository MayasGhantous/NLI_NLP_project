  good idea . 
  will do . 
  oh , and if you want , i can send you one of my templates ( i added kurdish and various caucasian languages ), 
  i do n't know about negotiations so far , but here is the current status : [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/schengen_visa_requirements.png )  dark blue - no visa required , schengen area ;  light blue - no visa required , special territories of schengen member states ;  dark green - no visa required ( annex ii ) ,  red - visa required ( annex i ) ;  brown - visa required ( annex i ) , transit visa required ;  pink - passport not recognized ;  gray - no information, 
   etymology resources are scarce . 
  russian wiktionary can be of help . 
  i use omniglot for transliterations as they have both cyrillic and latin scripts for caucasian languages . 
   i think i have to agree . 
  although it was worth the experiment , i wanted to have the map look less flat , but in the end it 's just confusing unless the colours are correlated with something i sometimes use close shades when there are 2 simmilar etymologies via different routes . 
  for example , i used bright yellow for `` pine '' and dark yellow for `` pine-apple '' in my * ananas * map . 
  you could use something similar with the finno-ugric vs. `` medh '' . 
  they might be related so you could use two close colors for this ( say yellowish-green vs. blue-ish green ) . 
  just a suggestion . 
  anyway , this is actually a very good and interesting map . 
  sorry if i cam out * too * critical , 
  i think using multiple shades of the same color makes this map difficult to read . 
  also : * you make it look as if the languages of the north caucasus and kalmykia are related to turkish . 
  grey would probably be preferable * estonia 's islands . 
  * the little yellow patch at the north romania/ukraine border is not hungarian but ukrainian speaking . 
  * abkhaz is not related to georgian , but are the same color . 
  * i suggest only abreviating pie . 
  the rest might be too obscure for non-linguists, 
   if you have a reproductive focus , then suddenly the whole thing makes sense [ ... ]  try to learn and find truth . 
  for conservatives this is usually in history , anthropology and biology . 
  people can have a very good understanding of human instincts and how they shape society and gender roles and whatnot without being conservative . 
  actually historians and anthropologists are more often then not left-leaning . 
  also you must know that even if nature is a certain way , it does n't mean that society has to be shaped a certain way . 
  the old `` is '' / `` ought '' chestnut . 
   but again patriarchy is simply normality . 
  so is spousal abuse . 
  rape . 
  and a lot of other fun things . 
   just the older , more natural worldview , that is all . 
  this feels like appeal to tradition and appeal to nature , both being logical fallacies ( since you insist so much on logic ) . 
  so the problem with gays is that they are submissive and therefore not good soldiers , but that they are also non-submissive about gay rights ? 
  should i take it that you surbscribe to the ancient roman idea that there is no gay or straight , only submissive and dominant ? 
  should i take it that you view `` gay '' as the sub in the relationship , while the dominant is not actually `` gay '' ? 
  do you view dominant heterosexual females and submissive hetero males as equivalent to gays ? 
   for me the gay couple symbolizes decadence and weakness - the kind of people i could not rely on in a war . 
  israel disagrees with you ( they have no problem with gays in the military afaik ) , and i think they are quite knowledgeable when it comes to war methinks . 
  there are plenty of europeans who think like this , some inside the eu . 
  russia = good - eu = gay nazis !, 
   which was a dick move by the slovaks imo . 
  good thing the constitution protects romanian citizens of being stripped of citizenship if it was acquired by birth . 
  i wonder if the `` new citizens '' will vote fidesz . 
  are there any statistics about this i wonder . 
  if i 'll be a citizen by then , i know i wo n't . 
   the issue is that you say the place you were born is your home , but you still identify with another land , another country and by national pride you specifically mean citizenship . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  a lot of them get the citizenship for pragmatic reasons , because it gets you visa free travel ( to us and canada i think ) and because someone saying they are a `` hungarian citizen '' might have better chances of employment than someone saying they are a `` romanian citizen '' ( unfortunately ) . 
  not for national pride . 
  hungary tried to introduce something similar - `` hungarian certificate '' or something like that , something without practical benefits - and the hungarians in the neighboring countries got offended . 
  do you really think moldovans queuing for romanian citizenship do it for `` national pride '' ? 
  they do it for easy acces into the eu . 
  the same reason moldovan bulgarians are more likely to apply for romanian citizenship than bulgarian . 
   how is this helping anyone ? 
  it creates more problems and has more disadvantages than advantages , so why do it ? 
  to what end ? 
  everything you ask can be asked about moldova as well . 
  semester got watered down in some context to sort of `` half-year '' . 
  so half a school-year is still a semester despite it not being strictly `` six months '', 
  the `` mester '' part means `` months '' . 
  so tri-mester = three-months , and `` se-mester '' is `` six-months '' http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/semester#english http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trimester#english, 
  semester means `` six-months '' . 
  or a romanian speaker . 
  it literally means `` three months '', 
  [ also ] ( http://www.dw.de/moldova-trebuie-s%c4%83-reziste-%c3%aenc%c4%83-14-zile/a-17223252 ) ^ ^ [ ro ]  on the other hand , in his speech in brussels , russian deputy prime minister tried to panic the eu as well , talking about the economic consequences of initiating the association agreement with moldova : `` more than 700,000 people from moldova work in russia . 
  their money sent to moldova represents a substantial part of their national budget . 
  you want them all to come to europe ? '', 
  the russian official asked rhetorically . 
  yep . 
  14 ^ th soviet army . 
   this wo n't solve the issue since it 's already not democratic : that example is bullshit . 
  unless you want to claim france is undemocratic because brittany 's wishes can be overriden by the rest of france through majority in the french parliament . 
  the ep has popular mandate . 
  that makes it democratic . 
   against a valid point except it 's not . 
  it 's a bullshit analogy , on par with godwin . 
  it is an appeal to emotions . 
   having dictators in italy and greece did those `` dictators '' have parliamentary mandate ? 
  were those parliaments popularly elected ? 
   people did not agree with his policies at all , and they still were under his rule without choosing him . 
  happens in democracies all the time . 
  that 's why he got punished in the elections . 
  like it happens to unpopular pms in every other democracy . 
   i 've said before lisbon is not legitimate it might not be ( i dissagree ) , but still it went in the direction of increasing democratic legitimacy of the eu . 
  which was my point . 
   does n't need to be changed , it needs to be redesigned from the ground up . 
  the current structure was build shortly after the eu was founded . 
  everyone got some seats in the parliament , you can only vote for your own parliamentarians ( nice eu spirit ) , every country gets a commissioner , etc. . that 's because it evolved from an intergovernmental thing . 
  sure , we could redesign it to make it into a supranational government , but the euroskeptiks ( and not only them ) would go even more crazy . 
  yeah , i 'd like to see pan-european candidates and a reasonable number of comissioners as well . 
  ( pan-european referendums as well , instead of this per-country fiasco ) . 
   yes we are europeans but we are all dutch , french or romanian first ... that 's no shame , but we just should n't pretend that getting rid of physicall borders will make cultural borders fade . 
  i agree that national identity still trumps the european one ( and will do so for some time ) , but i dissagree that cultural borders will remain as strong as they are . 
  they wo n't dissapear entirely , but they will fade to an extent . 
  also , it 's somewhat irrelevant . 
  what matters is how close europeans feel culturally to each other , not how close they actually are . 
  the dm headline is superb : '' [ dozens of eu human rights are smuggled into the uk ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2504832/dozens-eu-human-rights-smuggled-uk-grayling-attacks-brussels-claims-judge.html ) '', 
   people who say that the eu ( as an institution ) is n't working properly are framed as nationalists and eurosceptics .
