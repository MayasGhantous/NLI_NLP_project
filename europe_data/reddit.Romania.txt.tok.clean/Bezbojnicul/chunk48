  that is not true . 
  people who think that the eu is n't working properly ** and therefore we should ditch the whole thing ** are called euroskeptics . 
  a lot of europhiles agree that shit ai n't working properly and we still need to tweek it this way or that way . 
   there is no point in having a 750 people big eu parliament if do n't have legislative initiative . 
  i agree that the ep needs legislative initiative asap . 
   and with less than 43 % of the people turning up to vote for the eu parliament ( 20 % in slovakia and under 50 % in 18 out of the 27 members ) i think this is tied somewhat to the amount of power the ep has . 
  people wo n't be bothered to vote , if they feel the ep is mostly impotent . 
  give the ep power to affect the voter , and the voter will start getting interested in the ep . 
   there is also no `` eu media '' that can check the government . 
  there are 27 different national media outlets that sometimes report on the eu , but it is nowhere near the amount of time they put into checking their own government . 
  i think expanding the ep 's role might draw some attention from the media . 
  but i 'm curious . 
  would you want an eu-level bbc , or it 's just that you are frustrated that the rivate sector is n't interested ? 
  fixed . 
   a guy in favor of the eu construction does n't care about the people 's voice . 
  than the problem is `` the guy '' , not the eu . 
   his declaration was quite early after the referendum , i 'll find it for you tomorrow . 
  i do n't doubt it . 
   stop using a strawman . 
  '' - type bullshit * stops as well . 
   this does n't mean that the eu does n't show a very disturbing democratic deficit as shown above . 
  while i agree that there is some democratic deficit , the trend has been positive so far , with the expantion of the ep 's role via lisbon , and the subsequent [ push by the ep to assert iself more and more ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10gjll/the_story_of_a_forthcoming_parliamentary_coup/ ) . 
  well , the arguments are ridiculous regardless of who makes them , and i 'm sure there are enough eastern european dissidents who think the same . 
   neither are democratic . 
  highly debatable with regards to the eu . 
  especially since lisbon , which expanded the role of the ep . 
   the french and dutch refuse the european constitution and still have it imposed through the lisbon treaty . 
  the french and dutch should take it up with their elected representatives who signed the lisbon treaty , if they disagreed with the points so much . 
   the swedes refuse the euro and their prime minister says he will ask them again later anyway . 
  how much time does it have to pass until a population can be asked again regarding an issue ? 
   this shows that when talking about the european question , it 's not fascism when they do it . 
  wat  both want to impose a single model on a continent , one is much more subtle and efficient since it does n't kill people in the eu . 
  the difference between today 's cambodgia and the khmer rouge 's cambodgia is that `` one does n't kill people inside cambodgia '' , but both are political systems in cambodgia with a ruler at the top , therefore norodom sihamoni is literally pol pot . 
  fyi , the ussr wanted to impose a single model on the whole world , not just a continent . 
  so did the usa , so i guess they are literally ussr also . 
   serious debate about eu membership is suppressed if this is the level of debate , there is hardly anything `` serious '' about it . 
  comparing the eu or the eurozone to the ussr is not a valid point in this universe . 
  there is so much latin kinship in this thread ... 
  eurogodwin . 
  problem is , the more educated ones tend to not vote , so the decision at the ballot ends up in the hands of the least educated , so the politicians just cater to that electorate . 
  i 've come to have comparable dislike for the educated class as i have for the poor fuckers who sell their vote for 1 kilo of flour . 
  `` they are all the same '' is a convenient excuse for a lot of people to just continue being lazy on their high freakin ' horse . 
   banks , oil companies , etc. 
  strive for ~ ~ efficiency ~ ~ * profit *, 
   it 's always 20 years away . 
  we 're 50 years away . 
  he 's gon na live like a goat-king on the remittance money !, 
   just because you think you 're ready to have sex , does n't mean you can have it without the consent of your partner . 
  just because you promised sex and now you do n't want to give it , does n't mean you can claim your partner does n't have a penis , especially when said partner has a note from a doctor clearly stating that penis exists . 
   so far unanimous support has not happened and the reasons for that have been concerns over shortcomings in anti-corruption measures , in the fight against organised crime , and potential influx of illegal immigrants [ from outside the eu ] . 
  those are legitimate concerns . 
  but those are not the only reasons unanimity has n't happened . 
  let 's not kid ourselves . 
   meanwhile just recently in romania it reportedly takes only two cows , three sheep and two lambs to bribe a senior prosecutor . 
  how much would it take to bribe a border controller or a senior officer ? 
  also , reportedly , trying to do so will land you in jail , nevermind the news . 
  that news , and all the others like it are signs that justice is working , and corruption is being delt with . 
  an unintended side-effect of anti-corruption picking up strenght . 
   less helpful strategies would be for example publicly insinuating that those concerns are only a political ploy it might be less helpful , but it does n't mean other countries ' politicians are n't exploiting the schengen issue for their own political gain . 
  and i do n't think schengen membership should be dependent on the french ( or dutch , or whatever ) voter 's sympathies or stereotypical image of romania . 
  in case you are wondering , i do consider the corruption issue relevant an legit , and had they schengen countries been upfront about it , many people would not have had an issue . 
  but you ca n't change goalposts mid-game . 
  you ca n't say it depends on the technical criteria , and when they are met go `` we 'll block you for as long as we can find excuses , be they legitimate or not '' . 
   pointing out the problems of others ( e.g. 
  italy ) as evasion , you do realise that with italy and greece , you are teaching us that we only have to make it seem like we are n't corrupt untill we get in . 
  then we can get away with anything . 
  edit : missread something, 
  i do n't think these are unfair . 
  i was just detailing how our referendums function . 
   ( they need work permit still for some , but that have nothing with schengen ) just untill january 1 ^ st 2014 , 
  i think it 's because the two regions usually vote in different ways , and any issue would just turn into a wallonia vs flanders argument . 
   it 's who 's inside those two countries already , i.e. 
  roma people and the assorted array of criminals . 
  those people can already travel pretty freely to western europe , as evident by the scandals popping up in the press . 
  also , hungary , slovakia and czechia also have their fair share of roma , and they are schengen members .

   it 's a choice . 
  more or less ... 
  it 's only unconstitutional if the hungarians ask for something . 
  i always wonder where \u201e brave defenders of article 1 '' ^ ^ ^ tm are when the monarchists are out protesting ... ps . 
  actually article 1 could be changed . 
  you just need to change article 152 first . 
  after a quick google search i found [ an article from february 2012 ] ( http://www.romaniatv.net/ursii-au-coborat-in-brasov-in-cautare-de-hrana_14381.html ) . 
  so probably yes . 
  should have been in plural .
