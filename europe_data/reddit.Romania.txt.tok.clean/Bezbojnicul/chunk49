   * mistre\u021b * - singular * mistre\u021bi * - plural, 
   also i 'm guessing the mistret left cluj-napoca ? 
  no idea tbh . 
  probably . 
  ** romania ** * [ thousands of doctors and nurses demonstrated in bucharest ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/health-proffesionals-in-romania-demand-better-pay ) , asking for higher salaries , better working conditions and more investment in the country 's cash-starved healthcare system * [ new budget approved ] ( http://www.balkaninrsight.com/en/article/romania-agrees-2014-budget-with-imf-eu ) .

  i know , but he asked if it makes sense . 
   if possible , does it make sense ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genericized_trademark ) . 
  does it make sense that you can have a * hamburger * in new york ? 
   what do we call someone who hates arabs and assyrians for example ? 
  [ arabophobia or antiarabism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabophobia ) apparently . 
  i do n't know if hatered of assyrians is widespread enough to have resulted in a word being coined for it in english . 
   is it realistic to call a semite antisemite if an arab does n't like jews ? 
  yes . 
  words can have different meanings then their etymologies . 
  for example if i ask you `` understand ? '', 
  i am not actually asking if you are standing under something  claiming that a word is exactly its etymology ( like many who say `` israel is antisemitic because palestinians are semites '' ) are using what is known as an [ etymological fallacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymological_fallacy ) also , you should take note that while the use of `` semitic languages '' is still used , the idea of `` semitic peoples '' is a bit outdated , being from the same period as the idea of `` aryan poples '' and other pseudo scientific racial theories . 
  back when the jews were defined as semitic , probably none of them actually spoke a semitic language ( hebrew was brought back from the dead in the early 20th century ) . 
   i just noticed i did n't mention how i recognized him as being jewish : he had the whole black robes , goofy hat and long sideburns thing goin ' on . 
  i once saw a couple of those types . 
  was with a friend , who thought they were [ gabor gypsies ] ( http://romafacts.uni-graz.at/index.php/culture/culture-3/the-gabor-in-transylvania--romania ) ( jews round here are the `` looks like everyone else '' secular type ) . 
  the only other time i saw religious jews ( sideburns and all ) was when i was in paris about 6 years ago . 
  such is life ... 
   and finnish and hungarian , which are uralic . 
  and estonian and saami . 
  my mistake . 
  memory seemed to be playing tricks on me . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i seemed to remember that ukrainians in crimea and tatars were way fewer than they actually are , and i assumed that the tatars were , like other minorities in post-soviet states quite pro-russia . 
  just one step away from bdsm, 
  the dialects of croatia are more apart from each other than standard croatian vs standard serbian vs standard bosnian, 
  typical imperialist serb !!, 
   is there a chance any regions would try breaking away from the rest of ukraine ? 
  maybe . 
  crimeea is an autonomous republic , it 's virtually 100 % russian and it ussed to belong to russia untill the 50s ( i think ) . 
  so that might be a good spot for a transnistrian scenario ... 
  there are lots of slavic , german and latin words in hungarian . 
  also some transylvanian romanians might understand some words of hungarian because there are a lot of dialectal words of hungarian origin here . 
  i 'd imagine the same is true with slovak and serbian . 
  there are also many turkic words in the balkan languages . 
  they kind of are , but groeningen uni did n't get the memo , 
   as soon as the `` everyone is equal '' spirit is lost equal in some respects , but not in other . 
  germany is the strongest economy , everybody understands this and recognizes this . 
  like a gentleman 's club . 
  we all are equal members * , but when it comes to getting the job done , some have a stronger voice , because they have a bigger bank account , 
  that is a very real possibility . 
  there was an interesting article in the romanian press that i will post a bit latter ( need to g!translate and check for coherence ) about how the eu and ukraine might fuck this up . 
  ctrl + f `` fluently '' 0 results edit : to whoever downvoted nowhere in the link above does it say that 60 % of romanians speak english fluently . 
  what it says is :  `` romanians are best foreign language speakers in europe '' , according to the eastern european translators association . 
  according to a study made by this organization 60 % of the romanians speak a foreign language , usually english . 
  some 25 % of them speak 2 foreign languages ( usually english and french ) , while 4 % of them speak more than 2 foreign languages . 
  i very much doubt it that 60 % speak english * fluently * . 
  hungarian not in the list . 
  weird ... ( but moldavian is ), 
  did n't the spanish expel the converts as well after a while ? 
  `` cultural critique '' , please . 
   the byzantine empire was roman . 
  it was many things , including roman , and greek , and christian and so on . 
  `` greek '' and `` roman '' are not mutually exclusive labels . 
  sicily , sardinia , corsica and the baleares can not into italy , france and spain, 
  let me see if i understand :  the number of irish residents who were born outside ireland continues to increase and stood at 766,770 but  the total number of non-irish nationals has increased by 124,624 persons or 29.7 % from 419,733 to 544,357 . means that 766,770 are people living in ireland born outside ireland , out of which 544,357 are irish citizens , the rest being resident non-citizens . 
  too complicated . 
  there is too much dialectal variation . 
  ro : cartof , croamp\u0103 , picioic\u0103 , barabul\u0103 , etc, 
  that might have to do with economic insecurity . 
  hungary 's far right has nothing to do with immigrants , but it found other `` others '' to exploit virtually the same way as western far-right party exploits the image of the immigrant . 
  we have always been killing each other . 
  they were both , imho . 
   well are we describing 1940 's america as multicultural ? 
  yes , given the high number of immigrants , and the way they were viewed . 
  there were [ ethnic neighborhoods ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/mulberry_street_nyc_c1900_loc_3g04637u_edit.jpg ) in major cities . 
  you might view them as all as `` european culture '' but you 'd be projecting a contemporary view on things . 
  they did not view each other as such . 
   different cultures were all but not equal you are thinking of `` races '' . 
   our foreign born population stands at 17 % . 
  wiki says 12 % according to 2011 census . 
  why do you think it 's bigger ? 
   not that i have heard of if you are referring to measuring for example 1st generation vs. 2nd second generation vs. 3td generations vs. natives . 
  was thinking 2nd generation vs. native . 
   the point in here was that us gathered such large amounts of immigrants in its existence that if us in deed was a melting pot it would have changed from the uk and other english speaking countries . 
  i understood your point . 
  i was thinking this measurement could be used to asses how well 2nd generation immigrants in various countries adopted the host-culture . 
  to actually see how much cultural divide there is . 
  we all know the media is a distorted mirror . 
   and many mixed marriage children are fully natives . 
  [ this dude ] ( http://www.cinemagia.ro/actori/cabral-ibacka-23348/ ) - of half-congolese origin - is closer culturally to mainstream romania than i am , 
   hofstede dimensions intersesting . 
  are there any immigrant vs. native comparisons ? 
  ( us , uk , elsewhere eu ) ? 
   honestly i think its the way the us handles it , they 're so proud and happy about their country i do n't think it 's necessarily the nationalism , but it is one part of a larger picture . 
  i think a big part of it is the `` national narrative '' . 
  european identities are most often than not defined by blood ties to the land . 
  the idea that any schmuck from wherever can become `` european '' is kind of foreign ( maybe france is a bit of an exception ) . 
  otoh , american identity is that of the `` immigrant melting pot '' , it 's much more open to assimilate outsiders . 
  that 's why a persian waving the american flag is seen as normal , but a persian waving a [ euro-country ] flag is seen as out of place . 
  because the euro-country flag is seen as way more tied to a particular `` native '' population and its history .
