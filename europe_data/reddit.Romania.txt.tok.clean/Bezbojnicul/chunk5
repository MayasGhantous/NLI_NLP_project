   have some sort of relation to the aggressor like a common nationality ... ( just saying . 
  some people take nationality very seriously ), 
   important : upon a decision of the central electoral commission , all online media are forbidden to publish any polling results , so i ca n't give you links . 
  the media are using their social networks to share results as the prohibition does not apply there . 
  the law is similar in romania . 
  so five years ago , in the second round , we had two candidates whose party colors were red and orange respectively . 
  now the word in romanian for tomato basically means `` red '' , just like orange can mean both the fruit and the color . 
  so to get around the ban on reporting partial results , tvs would report on the `` estimated price of oranges and tomatoes at 15 o'clock '' and similar news . 
   no , he 's just from a nation of murderers . 
  watch it !, 
  also , if someone uses an ethnic slur , you should report it , not use one yourself . 
  i see another generalization or an ethnic slur on your part , you get a time out .

  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/ulster_banner.svg/800px-ulster_banner.svg.png ) is counted as northern ireland , and can safely be put under uk ( given how it 's used by loyalists ) . 
  they do n't use it any more officially , given how it 's associated with one of the sides of the conflict , so yeah , ni does not have an official flag . 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/flag_of_ulster.svg/1024px-flag_of_ulster.svg.png ) is the ulster one mentioned at the end , separately . 
   something something unelected bureaucrat, 
  it 's usually taken together with georgia and armenia , which are both christian countries , ( orthodox and armenian church , respectively ) . 
  georgia , in light of its christian orthodox nature , can be viewed as relatively similar to balkan and russian christians , ( byzantine heritage ) , and therefore european . 
  azerbaijan is also turkic and secular ( due to soviet influencce ) , so i think it is just easier to lump the 3 together , especially if one is inclined to view turkey as borderline european as well . 
  it 's also [ a bit european geographically as well ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg/1000px-europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg.png ) . 
   and the smell of rotting meat what meat ? 
  there was no meat . 
  only sadness ... 
  i 'm staying the fuck away from the geographic aspect , given how [ complicated it is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ) ... 
  thank you . 
  central european - culturally eastern european - geopolitically / recent history-wise ( i.e. 
  `` post-communist '' , `` former-warsaw pact '' or `` new europe '' ) the two are not mutually exclusive . 
  i 'm gon na need a source for that quote . 
  man , this really makes me wan na visit a coruna ( and galicia in general ) . 
  also i nostalgia 'd for andalusia . 
  i spent 2 weeks last year there , it was one of the most wonderful vacations i ever took . 
   but istanbul was an ugly city . 
  i quite enjoyed it ( just returned from an istambul + edirne & bursa summer vacation ) . 
  happened to me too ( some 6 years ago ) . 
  it was around closing time then . 
   you ca n't pitch a tent outside a camping ground anywhere in europe . 
  you can in romania afaik . 
  i think there might be a recent law against it , but nobody really gives a hoot . 
   and should be regarded as an attempt to put pressure on the independent policy of our state that 's exactly what it is . 
  and it 's a good thing . 
   `` the fifth colon '' is deprived of its opportunities to fulfill its mission and it ultimately weakens the pressure weapons against azerbaijan . 
  you should try reposting the question to / r/askeurope, 
   the highest numbers do n't have green , but turquoise turquoise ? 
  where ? 
  partially . 
  the green ^ good - yellow ^ neutral - red ^ bad scale is pretty common and generally the colors are perceived as such . 
  in this case , the color scale is only partially implemented , so the implication is not that strong , but it still could easily be read as such . 
  see [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vz6wr/share_of_young_people_in_the_eu_aged_2534_who_are/cexa4lt ) for example . 
  you are right . 
  it should probably be correlated with [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehef99r.png ) ^ ^ [ [ sauce ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vz6wr/share_of_young_people_in_the_eu_aged_2534_who_are/ ) ] regarding young people living with their parents , a thing that is partially cultural , partially economic . 
  romania : there is a list [ here ] ( http://www.dcnews.ro/cele-mai-ciudate-nume-de-localita-i-din-romania-curva-madulari_445377.html ) , but someone else will have to do the translations . 
  well , with some googling i found [ this document ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/cel_mai_vechi_document_din_%c5%a2ara_rom%c3%a2neasc%c4%83.jpg ) on wiki , named `` oldest document from wallachia , by which vladislav-vlaicu grants some villages to vodi\u0163a monastery '' , and it 's from 1374 . 
  but there are older inscriptions , such as the [ tombstone of nicolae alexandru ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/8/89/nicolaealexandrutomb.jpg ) ( vladislav-vlaicu 's predecessor ) , from 1364 . 
  i do n't have anything against re-posting . 
  i just thought the previous discussions would interest people who missed it . 
   but again the oldest writing in romanian is only from 1512 . 
  which by the way means that we do n't even know about bucharest from a romanian source ... just because the oldest writing * in romanian * is from 1512 does not mean there are n't earlier local sources . 
  only that they used slavonic as a chancellery language , not the local vernacular . 
  last two discussion threads on / r/europe : * [ first ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jq0h3/map_population_of_foreign_citizens_in_europe_in/ ) * [ second ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24zmrs/foreign_citizens_in_europe_2012/ ), 
   and of course the ever popular ` i 'm older than slovakia ' tee . 
  wow , that 's douchey ... 
  well , csilla , t\u00fcnde and enik\u0151 were n't real hungarian names until some writers invented them , now they are as normal as m\u00e1ria and zs\u00f3fia . 
   in lithuanian language ugn\u0117 name sounds rather beautiful , it means `` fire '' . 
  etymology time : ugn\u0117 is [ cognate ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:proto-indo-european/h%e2%82%81n%cc%a5g%ca%b7nis ) with the latin * ignis * which gave us fancy english words like `` to ignite '' and `` ignition '' as well as the name '' [ ignatius ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/ignatius ) '' . 
  the hindu fire god 's name is agni , also a cognate . 
   khaleesi is a title , not a name . 
  so were [ augustus ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/augustus ) ( sort of ) , [ basil ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/basil-1 ) and [ amir ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/amir-1 ) to name a few . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9chenyi_thermal_bath ), 
  met one red-haired albanian girl in athens . 
   istanbul is a hell of a city and a very european one , at that . 
  man , fuck that neighbourhood . 
  but i agree , it 's one hell of a city . 
  ( just returned from there ), 
   because on the third county ( mure\u0219 ) they lost the majority i doubt it had a hungarian majority in its current boundaries . 
  targu mures ( the county see ) did until recently , but the county as a whole i seriously doubt it ( and keep in mind that [ interwar mures had a somewhat different territory than today 's mures county ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/romania_counties_1930-2008.svg/1024px-romania_counties_1930-2008.svg.png ) ), 
  afaik both favor the north-pontic one , but i do n't hang around / r/archeology enough to know for sure . 
  there was some buzz recently around the anatolian hypothesis , with a [ computer model ] ( http://languagesoftheworld.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3300bce.jpg ) , but afaik , [ it was kinda bad science ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1fz22j/anatolian_vs_kurgan_pie_hypotheses/ ) . 
  and maltese . 
   most linguists favor an anatolian origin for the indo-european languages i 'd really like a source for this . 
  from my time around / r/linguistics it looks as if the north-of-the-black-sea hypothesis is clearly the dominant one . 
   or the balkan countries . 
  i do n't know if you consider romania balkan ( i say we are ) , but our relationship with turkey is good , and there is nothing to suggest ( afaik ) that we would be opposed to turkish accession , once the criteria are fulfilled . 
   it 's believed the slavs were the majority , hence why bulgarian is a slavic language . 
  this does n't necessarily have to be the rule though . 
  the hungarians were a minority most likely at first , but still they managed to assimilate the avar-slavic inhabitants of what is now hungary . 
  yeah , but for about 1000 years , romania was just `` invasion highway '' .
