  the us is ful of ethnic neighbourhoods , there are a lot of hispanics who `` no hablan ingles '' and so on . 
  you make the us and europe seem like polar opposites , which is far from the truth . 
  sure , there are differences , but i do n't think immigrants melt away as fast as you think . 
   this is exactly why the roman empire fell this is straight up simplistic bs . 
  you might want to read [ this / r/askhistorian discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/td5dw/examples_of_successful_multiculturalism/c4lqa7q ) . 
   the japanese empire succeeded : japan was homogeneous . 
  the japanese empire failed at the hands of a much more multiculti empire ( the american one ) . 
  and wales . 
  [ about ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arpad_stripes#historical_use ), 
   something to do with the new party in hungary , but i might be wrong . 
  it 's not the new party . 
  it 's the `` old '' jobbik 's paramilitary wing ( disbanded by the law ) . 
  * artificial blood created in cluj, 
  how about everyone stops acting like an idiot ? 
  i enjoyed [ 12:08 east of bucharest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12:08_east_of_bucharest ) . 
  also , you 'll probably like [ beyond the hills ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beyond_the_hills ) . 
  when available , i included sicilian as well . 
  there is no area with occitan separately colored . 
  only the name . 
  unlike in ireland where you have both the name , and some areas . 
  since this is top comment , i 'll take the opportunity to post the uptadet version of the maps : http://imgur.com/a/zrznb ( updated ), 
  will correct, 
  yeah , i did not put that big an emphasis on north africa ( berber and maghrebi dialectal words ) . 
  lack of information , plus the fact that i chose to concentrate on europe mostly . 
  i also put less emphasis on kurdish dialectal differences . 
   they speak spanish in catalonia as well though . 
  as a second language , except the urban areas of barcelona metropolitan area , while the countryside is catalan . 
  otoh english is the first language of most of the irish , including the countryside , baring the west . 
  this map is based on a simplified map , where focus is placed on the dominant language in an area , not the `` historic language '' or the `` national language '' . 
  coloring the whole of ireland with irish makes it seem like irish is dominant all over ireland , which we both know is false . 
  that 's because most of ireland speaks english . 
  irish is featured on the western fringe of ireland . 
  ** romanian ** : opt / noapte otoh , night rhymes with seven : noapte / \u0219apte,

  there was a great one about [ cheese ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1999h3/i_made_a_map_of_words_for_cheese_in_some_european/c8m5aqf ) some time ago . 
  there are also a few [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1d87sx/tool_to_create_word_maps_europe_template/ ) . 
  maybe try searching around / r/mapporn for some more . 
  demeterius of the bear, 
  i beg to differ . 
   nouns are capitalized in german !, 
  i know , but i decided not to capitalize in order for them to be as the other languages . 
  `` dud '' in romanian . 
  good idea . 
  will try ( but it might take a while ) . 
  [ they do ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1pqtzn/europe_etymology_maps_some_new_some_old/ ) , 
  but afaik `` ale '' is used for a specific kind of bier in anglophone countries . 
  i included the word from [ sicilian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_language ) whenever wiktionary mentioned it . 
  i need a second opinion [ on this , btw ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1pqtzn/europe_etymology_maps_some_new_some_old/cd52fni ), 
  would writing it `` baar '' on the map be easier to read though ? 
   low and high german capitalise nouns , by the way i know , but i chose to ignore that for the sake of aesthetic consistency . 
  i will soon . 
  made some corrections to some of the maps based on comments . 
  will fix . 
   the northpole is called antarctis the north pole is called arctic , but you are right that it comes from `` arktos ''  antarctica ( anti arctos = no bears ) i think anti arctos means something more like `` opposite the arctic '' or `` opposite to the place with bears '', 
  my pleasure , 
  it was `` b\u00e5r '' [ on witionary ( `` large mammal of family ursidae '' menu ) ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bear ) . 
  but i 'll change it if it 's wrong . 
  i went 1 word per language , so you 're covered by german , usually placed in southern germany . 
  in which context would one or another be used ? 
  peaches ( called `` persian apples '' in latin ) , cherries ( named after the ancient sity of cerasus , now [ gerasun , turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giresun ) ) are n't native either . 
  [ low german ] ( https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/kark_\\ ( huus \\ ) ), 
  interesting . 
  i still have a few more i would like to make , but these do take quite some time . 
   people used to call everything we call orange today red . 
  old english used `` yellow-red '', 
  building . 
   or do only west slavic languages make the distinction ? 
  hungarian does too . 
  oh , i misread your conversation a bit . 
  in my defence , i did that one in a hurry . 
  look at the * bear * one . 
  still , basque is even more lonely ,, 
  it 's interesting that spanish actually does have `` ananas '' but it 's used in various countries of latin america, 
   scandinavian \u00f8l and \u00f6l come from a completely different root and meaning to irish \u00f3l . 
  interesting . 
  source ? 
  as someone already mentioned [ over on / r/mapporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1ppgob/how_to_say_i_in_various_european_languages/cd4siok ) , the romanian \u201e eu '' [ jew ] is sometimes turned into \u201e io '' [ jo ] in informal speach, 
   also < 3 / u/bezbojnicul [ 1 ] for including frisian . 
  i try to make my maps as inclusive as the internet will let me . 
  no reason to exclude frisian . 
  only `` water '' `` orange '' and `` cucumber '' are mine , the rest are made by others , using my blueprint , including one with [ the names for germany from wiki ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/germany_name_european_languages.svg/2000px-germany_name_european_languages.svg.png ), 
  there is little evidence to give this theory any credibility . 
  it does n't help that it was done in the `` capital of transylvania '' . 
  illegal ( consumption , cultivation and especially comercialisation ) . 
  afaik , consumers get fined , dealers get in much more serious trouble ( probably depends on whether they are big fish or small fish ) . 
  yes , i support legalisation . 
  except i do n't like it as much as the old one . 
  you do understand the difference between an opinion and a fact , do n't you ? 
   they fucking bought her . 
  is there any proof of this ( besides the whole contradictory statements ) or are we still just going we the `` guilty until proven innocent '' angle ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  there is an element of classism there as well . 
   the czech republic and slovakia have the same problems as romania and bulgaria . 
  not to mention hungary . 
  jobbik 's rise was on a wave of very strong antitziganism . 
  now why did n't the bulgarian gypsies think of that ? 
  the munteanu family [ would like to say hi ] ( http://cdn1.independent.ie/irish-news/article29696144.ece/alternates/h342/nws_20131024_new_002_29383597_i1.jpg ) . 
  why not ? 
  romania has the most ( bigger country ) , slovakia has the biggest percentage iirc . 
   because they prefer their primitive nomadic lifestyle .
