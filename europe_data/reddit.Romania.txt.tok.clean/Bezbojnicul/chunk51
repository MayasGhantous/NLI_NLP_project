  the overwhelming majority of roma are sedentary . 
   udmr are not extremists i must have mistaken you for another redditor then . 
   it 's an ethnic party . 
  that is not a bad thing necessarily , although i agree that ideally , there would not be a need for such a party . 
  i thought the title meant `` pro-settlement '' as in `` pro-settlers-from-anatolia '', 
  i think remeber you defining udmr as `` extremist '' . 
  is my memory playing tricks on me ? 
  my point was that the the two situations are different . 
  so was u/criticalstories 's . 
   this kind of irrational fear of extremism ~ ~ you should be the last person to talk about `` irrational fear of extremism '' ~ ~ otoh , you are right in that i might have read to much into the comment . 
  i 'm just sick and tired of this bullshit comparison . 
   does that mean they should n't learn the language ? 
  where did i say this ? 
  u/capycapy 's argument was that citizenship should be based on knowledge of the official language and that romania should do * this * to its hungarian minority [ i.e. 
  give citizenship based on knowledge of the local language ] as you might very well know , romania 's hungarian minority is awarded birthright citizenship ( just like everybody else who is born of parents that are romanian citizens , as opposed to recent immigrants ) . 
  ~ ~ so someone 's either advocating stripping the hungarian minority of citizenship ( which is barred by the constitution anyway ) , or they are quite ignorant , comparing apples with oranges . ~ ~, 
  but 1st generation immigrants do choose the country they emigrate to . 
  so that makes / u/capycapy 's parallel a situation of apples and oranges . 
   it 's worthless from what i 've seen , it 's mostly the dutch who feel insecure about their language and call it `` a small language ''  and ugly de gustibus , i guess . 
   perhaps if you 'd need to learn a simple language ( like english ) okay , but dutch is n't all that simple . 
  english is n't that simple either , tbh . 
  it may be simple on some fronts ( no gender , little declension ) , but it 's complex on others ( verb tenses , all the exceptions to the rules , and the exceptions to the exceptions , and so on ) . 
   seems fair to me me too . 
  if you moved somewhere , basic level of the official language as a prerequisite for citizenship is not that much to ask , tbh . 
   dutch language really is awful when you start learning it . 
  i just started , and i find it quite beautiful . 
  otoh , i think the germans thought they 'd go back to turkey once they were n't needed anymore . 
   after three years residence , they will be entitlrd to irish citizenship . 
  what are the requirements for irish citizenship besides the 3 year period ? 
  there are few among the hungarians in romania who do not speak the language , mostly elderly . 
  what the romanian state needs to do is improve its teaching of romanian . 
   nimetz previously suggested `` the republic of upper macedonia , '' but skopje rejected that proposal as `` utterly unacceptable . '', 
  i 'm curious as to why this was found to be unacceptable . 
  ( `` slavic-albanian macedonia '' is a terrible suggestion imo ), 
   they would just provoke a hungarian-romanian ethnic dispute ( as bloody as needed ) in transylvania , then occupy romania as a peacekeeping / `` democratization '' mission . 
  the fuck did this come from ? 
  first they came for the memes , and i did not speak out -- because i was not an image macro . 
  do n't worry . 
  if it was n't for wikipedia , i 'd never known either . 
   yeah , it is indeed a tiny family . 
  but it 's in [ a very diverse company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_caucasus ) . 
   i heard their language is unique among the globe , actually gerorgian has 3 more sibling languages ( 2 spoken in georgia , which i think , not sure , might be viewed as dialects - svan and mingrelian - and 1 spoken in turkey - laz ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kartvelian_languages, 
  shvili, 
  well , you 're an odd combination of family name and flair , 
   i already think mods can be heavy handed on these subjects , having it written down as a hard and fast rule is just going to make the environment even more oppressive these are the general principles we 've been moderating on so far , so it 's not like we just made them stricter . 
   saying `` i do n't think gay people should be able to marry . '', 
  may appear homophobic , `` i do n't want romanians and bulgarians to come to our shores . '', 
  could be xenophobic and `` roma are much more likely to commit crime . '', 
  might be racist , all depending on which eyes read it . 
  none of the sentences above are written in a hateful tone . 
  compare with `` gays should fuck off '' or `` gypsies are thievin scum '' . 
  on a side-note , a lot of politically very incorrect language is left undeleted in the roma threads . 
  only the worst of the worst is actually deleted . 
  yes . 
  ( we ca n't help with the downvotes though ), 
  there 's an element of style as well , so to say . 
  if the opinion is xenophobic at heart but the way it 's framed is open to discussion , we 're much more likely to leave it be . 
  off the top of my head :  `` i think non-european immigration should be heavily discouraged because they are more likely to be culturally incompatible and thus prone to creating social friction . 
  there are problems with multiculturalism such as ... '' versus  `` keep those shit-cultures out of europe !, 
  multiculturalism is literally raping our beautiful western civilization '' the first example is setting up a conversation , albeit from an unpopular position . 
  the second example is just hateful ranting . 
   it 's changed since & now it 'd be grouped with brasov county . 
  i do n't think that 's necessarily bad , given how interconnnected covasna and brasov counties are economically . 
  you could have a szeklerland + burzenland region , for example , in a trento-alto-adige style set-up . 
  but the devil would be in the details . 
   at the very least , basic recognition would be nice , and not be referred to as the `` so-called '' `` szeklers '' of `` szekler land '' . 
  yeah , i agree , that 's douchey . 
   an alphabet that looks kinda like the armenian one , but possibly no relation other than the same style of calligraphy ? 
  they are related . 
  some say they were invented by the same guy ( saint somebody ) and both ultimately derive from the phoenecian alphabet , probably via greek . 
  tbilisi is capital . 
  sakartvelo is endonym . 
  land of golden fleece from jason and the argonauts . 
  iberia and colchis . 
  used to be called gruzia as well ( which i favour because it eliminates confusion with another georgia ) kartvelian language ( s ) ( only found in caucasus ) everybody 's named - shvili or - dze . 
  had 3 autonomous regions . 
  adjaria is a region for `` muslim georgians '' ( sort of , most are christian there as well ) . 
  abkhazia and south ossetia had important non-georgian minorities ( first are north-west caucasians , second are iranic , related to the alans , some of which gave us some toponyms in hunggary and romania ) saakashvili was very pro-west and stupid enough to go to war with russia . 
  made some radical pro-market reforms . 
  wine country . 
  orthodox country . 
  anti-gay country . 
  got fucked over by the mongol invasion at their peak . 
  recently changed flag . 
  liked the old one better . 
  new one just screams `` crusader state '' . 
   have a poll conducted to asses the percentage of hungarians who want autonomy . 
  no such initiative has been put forth by either romanian or hungarian politicians . 
  at the same time , no plan has been put forth regarding what this autonomous region would entail . 
  both these things need to happen . 
  but it 's to every politicians ' advantage these not happening , so both sides can claim their position as true in the absence of any evidence to the contrary . 
   that map was proposed by a single nationalistic usl mp two years ago and has received no attention since then . 
  not to mention the fact that it mixes historical romanian regions , so it does n't have support even from the ethnic romanians . 
  he 's referring to this : [ royal hungary ( part of habsburg empire ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_hungary_%281538%e2%80%931867%29 ), 
   i actually wish the sz\u00e9kelys politicians would understand and address the concerns of the other romanians . 
  [ ... ] that 's why i 'm frustrated by their common , greedy politicians , incapable to see this great opportunity that they could intelligently champion for all romanians with the sz\u00e9kelys getting some bonus benefits . 
  if only they would be capable to talk with the rest of the country , if only they would not be so blind in their greed and if only they would be intelligent enough to strike acceptable compromises . 
  amen to this . 
  they really need to address the concerns of the majority if they wish to get popular support for the move . 
  so far they 've done it to a less than satisfactory level .
