   this coupled with their comical inability to speak romanian most hungarian politicians here have a good romanian ability as far as i 've seen , baring the specific accent . 
  i really do n't know . 
  in most of the proposals i 've seen they are indeed just part of a larger region . 
  i know , 
  nope . 
  this was for an autonomous region ( not independent country ) to be created from a small area in eastern transylvania . 
  a running joke over here is `` romania is a beautiful coutry , it 's a shame it 's inhabited '' . 
   but bratislava was a city inside the country of hungary a fact i did not question . 
  that alone does not make it \u201e hungarian '' in the ethnic sense , which is what i was referring to . 
  also : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24672090  there might be 23 candidates in sunday 's presidential election in georgia but in recent months two men already in power have been dominating the country 's politics . 
  and both are about to step down . 
  my long-ass reply just got accidentally deleted , and i 'm too tired to re-write it . 
  i 'll just leave [ this map here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:romaniaborderhistoryannimation_1859-2010.gif ) and say that since ww2 we are really anxious about separatism and iredentism from our neighbours . 
  nope . 
  romanians are very anti-federalisation ( due to historical reasons ) . 
  any kind of autonomy would be at best a unitary state type ( think italy - south tyrol - or spain - basque country ), 
   i would have guessed that the percentage was higher than just 6 % ( although that number was for the entire country , not transylvania ) for transylvania ( meaning transylvania proper + partium + banat ) it 's about 20 % . 
   after trianon , the romanian government moved ethnic romanian families into transylvania so as to dilute the region , and that has certainly come to fruition . 
  i do n't think that was very extensive . 
  also a lot of hungarians moved out after ww1 and more did after ww2 fearing reprisals , especially in more mixed areas . 
  the strongest change was in the cities , where rapid urbanisation during the communist times brought a lot of romanians from the surrounding countryside , which i mentioned [ in another comment ( but that 's not such a strange phenomenon actually ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1p4dtj/the_ethnic_groups_of_austriahungary_in_1910/ccz8brs?context=3 )  bratislava ( pozsony ) is another example of a city which was purely hungarian for 900 years prior to the world wars , and it was just taken away . 
  i doubt it was \u201e pure hungarian '' . 
  i 'd bet the germans had a sizeable presence , as they did in many cities back in the day . 
  i 'm also glad that the messages were more intelligently thought out , so as to address some of the anxieties of the romanian majority . 
  the way the campaign was run up until now was a bit too us-vs-them for my liking . 
  \u201e autonomy is not independence , it 's efficiency '' and \u201e we want autonomy , not independence '' - many romanians think the 2 are synonimous \u201e szeklerland , the other face of romania '' and \u201e romania is our country too '' which were pro-romania , and comes against the majority view that these protests are anti-romania somehow on the other hand , i really disliked the banner [ shown in this picture ] ( http://galeria.cdn.index.hu/belfold/2013/10/27/szekelyek_nagy_menetelese/5042884_7a9e56f5f5d54854ad99022a21299ab8_g.jpg ) as it is modelled on a famous [ anti-trianon poster ] ( http://image.hotdog.hu/user/gorbelabu/trianon_mapa.jpg ) . 
   give moscow a graceful exit and give moldova an express route for eu membership . 
  now why would moscow endorse transnistrian independece and give up moldova by doing this ? 
  it very much wants to not give moldova an express route to the eu , given how it sees it as part of its sphere of influence .

  kazakh haiku is best haiku, 
  [ here 's your first one ] ( http://media0.webgarden.ro/images/media0:4aacc45304641.jpg/img_3390.jpg ), 
   there 's a lot of downvotes in your sub . 
  if it 's from people coming from here , i 'd ask you to lay off . 
  yeah . 
  it 's really douchey . 
  we knew that from the get-go . 
  ( and i 'm not saying ad-hoc adoptions are ok ) . 
  but i love how a lot of the racist assumption at the beginning got turned on their head . 
  oh man , i love the outcome of this !, 
  first the 2 irish cases now this . 
  it 's mostly a new world thing anyway http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_solis#jus_soli_around_the_world, 
   change your laws to only include resident 's children . 
  generous immigration laws ? 
  some eu countries have lower requirements than you . 
  the pro-controlled-immigration folks always give canada as an example of what europe should do when it comes to immigration . 
  how they only import the skilled lot and not the poor unskilled ones like europe . 
   the only catch here is that by using its veto powers romania may potentially make other eu countries angry . 
  [ ... ] but in the end , others have used their eu veto powers against romania , so i have no qualms of conscience . 
  exactly . 
  western european states are using the schengen veto to score points on the home front . 
  why should we not use this power ? 
  france uses it all the time . 
  natural gas . 
  beautiful country . 
  the film monggol was filmed there . 
  biggest of the 5 post-soviet - stans language is turkic . 
  a lot of interesting minorities due to stalin shipping them of there . 
  such as germans , romanians , koreans and so on . 
  baikonur cosmodrome is there . 
  nuclear test site there ( semipalatinsk , iirc ) moved the capital recently . 
  apples come from there . 
  muslims , but very secularized . 
   they are not ethnic bulgarians . 
  it 's not 100 % clear that they are the parents even . 
  i was just saying that in case the parents are n't the current roma suspects . 
  sorry if it came out in an offensive way . 
   they have other blond/red haired kids as well . 
  it 's weird . 
  yeah , seeing the euronews video , it looks like some sort of mild albinism . 
  stronk party, 
   by her bulgarian roma parents . 
  she 's blond because she 's probably an albino . 
  or maybe the mother worked as a prostitute and got pregnant by a blond tourist in greece . 
  or maybe her parents are some poor semi-literate blonde ethnic bulgarians . 
  i know it would be plausible if it was romania instead of bulgaria . 
   thousands of roma children are abandoned every year in bulgaria . 
  they are overrepresented in orphanages here as well , afaik . 
   the orphanages in our country are truly the saddest , most wretched places you could find in europe . 
  each day i realize more and more how eerily similar our 2 countries are . 
   we need some new posting rules about infographics , imo , to require people to post their own sources , so we do n't have to do this research every time . 
  agreed . 
  and i 'm ok with removing it .

  the map smells a bit bullshitty tbh . 
  that optimism about the future made people take out bigger loans than they could afford to pay back in case anything happened . 
   in africa , you have often the situation that there is english or french as the countries official language , then there is an inofficial lingua france ( like swahili ) that is spoken with people from other parts of the country , and there is the village or regions traditional language . 
  problem is the official language is taught in school , whereas you said they * are fluent in * 3 languages before even going to school . 
  i really would like to see something that proves they are fluent in 3 languages by age 7 . 
  you make it sound as if they are `` confortable using all 3 languages '' by a very early age , but i 'm sure the level tends to fluctuate for national language and the lingua franca , based on various factors . 
  you also make it sound as if europeans are some sort of monolingual hicks , which is far from true . 
   we need english to become a second `` native language '' . 
  because only then we will be able to have a european democracy , with european news , european public discussions about european topics , european public figures , european politicians , etc. 
  so what is switzerland 's unifying language ? 
   do you see israel [ ... ] telling themselves they 're just too small to survive and that they need to merge with the 27 neighbour states ? 
  you mean the israel that is sometimes called `` the 51st state of the usa '' ? 
  israel might seem alone when looking at a map of the middle-east , but it 's got the full support of the us behind it . 
  i see your point , but israel is a terrible example . 
   you ca n't have an eu without nato , baltic and eastern states want the americans ' protection .
