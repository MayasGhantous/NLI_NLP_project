  at least until france and the uk ( through bruxelles ) guaranty a similar level of protection . 
   the only way to apply the rules you want within your country is to be sovereign and outside of the eu but what if i do n't want to apply the rules of my country in my region ? 
   for example that by european law , all public services and projects have to be subject to a process where the community has to put up an offer and the cheapest/best solution has to be taken from a selection of free competitors . 
  i do n't know how it is in other domains , but in public investments in new buildings/infrastructure as such , the rule here is that everything above 100.000 $ iirc needs a contest for `` cheapest solution '' . 
  everything below can be entrusted to whoever the mayor ( the local authorities ) wants to . 
  so this leads to either projects getting undervalued so that the mayor can entrust the project to whoever he wants , or competitions being rigged ( the desired company either underbidding unrealistically , or the other being eliminated on technicalities ) . 
   so the common practice of choosing the cheapest offer leads to tons of problems where cost estimates turn out to be wrong by a lot , sometimes an order of magnitude . 
  not only that , but sometimes the cheapest offer is not the best offer for the community . 
  as an architect , trust me , i know . 
  on the other hand i think this `` lowest offer '' approach can work in certain areas , and especially with big contracts ( which was probably the main target ) , where it makes corruption a bit more difficult . 
   the `` europe '' channels and fake tries in pr and advertisement is wasting a lot of money . 
  yeah , some of the attempts are quite cringeworthy , and some are just [ bureaucrats trying too hard ] ( http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-reaction-gif-steve-buscemi.gif ) , but on the other hand brussels gets chastised a lot for not `` communicating more efficiently '' and not being transparent . 
  two words : `` housing bubble '', 
  my impression is that most people agree that the euro has flaws and that those flaws stem from the way the euro was set up ( monetary union , but not much of a political/fiscal union ) . 
  the main divide seems to be what to do about it . 
  the spectrum seems to go from `` ditch the euro and keep the eu as loose as it is , or even more so '' all the way to `` keep the euro , but transfer more power to brussels to have that political and fiscal union that the euro needs to function '' . 
  also , a subject of debate , as you pointed out , is the size of the euro 's problems , and methinks , the size of the eu 's problems , and whether they are fixable or not . 
   honestly , i am well known to be a eurosceptic , but i get more and more tired of explaining to people on a side-note , i 'd like thank you for actually engaging in debates about the eu and putting effort into it . 
  such as ? 
  i admitted i 'm pro-eu , but what makes you say i 'm `` extremely pro-eu '' ? 
   you 're extremely pro-eu out of curiosity , on what do you base that `` extremely '' part ? 
   why in europe it is so hard to get people become fluent in two languages ? 
  according to eurostat , [ two-thirds of working age adults in the eu28 in 2011 state they know a foreign language ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-26092013-ap/en/3-26092013-ap-en.pdf ) . 
  now you show me the stats about how in `` african villages , kids grow up speaking three languages fluently without any school education '' . 
  fair enough . 
  thanks for the input . 
  not likely , but [ it can happen ] ( http://theochirac.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_3390.jpg ) . 
   the new it 's old son . 
   then dismiss all eurosceptic comments as `` hysterical europhobia '' i did not dismiss ** all ** eurosceptic comments . 
  `` more often '' means `` more then 50 % of the time '' not `` 100 % of the time '' . 
  i 've seen good ( meaning well argumented ) euroskeptic comments round here . 
  unfortunately , those are in the minority . 
  true for me as well . 
  there is soft-euro-skepticism in romania , but nothing of the more virulent type one sometimes sees here . 
   also , anti-eu people are likely to be downvoted ( they often come across as slightly aggressive about it , too ) so they often keep it to themselves . 
  i 'd love to see more well argumented euro-skeptical opinions in here , and i 'd love to see them not being downvoted . 
  i 'm pro eu and all that jazz , but i also read a couple of good columns on the eu in a romanian paper , and they often make very good arguments about how this and that part of the eu is disfunctional , and why . 
  i 'd love too see some good criticism like that . 
  what i see more often is hysterical europhobia unfortunatelly , and it 's a pitty . 
  ( and some of the europhiles can be shallow as well , not denying it ), 
  i noticed and i 'm pleasantly surprised ( especially given the vitriol on the original news ) . 
  feels good to be wrong on this one . 
   note that contemporary moldova is not politically connected to the historical principality of moldova it 's a bit more complicated , i 'd say . 
  do n't forget romania, 
  and that 's still lightyears away from `` gypsies steal children and sell them to belgian pedophiles '', 
   yes , they 're an indic ethnicity . 
  but they 've also been mingling with european for 900 years . 
  true . 
  sometimes you can have indian looking roma with fair skin and light hair , sometimes non-indian looking with dark skin . 
  sometimes not-roma looking at all . 
  knew a couple of kids who had a hungarian mother and a roma father and they were quite blond , but were still viewed as `` gypsies '' , cause people knew they were , but could easily pass as non-roma in a fresh environment . 
  yes !, 
  but we both know it wo n't . 
  anything that confirms a stereotype gets voted sky-high on / r/europe . 
  something that dismisses it gets about 20-30 points . 
   it 's a valid point then make it in a civilized manner . 
   the uk will most likely apply for a 5 year extension . 
  they are not allowed to . 
   i 'd be interested to find out what living in romania is like for foreigners , if there 's so much burocratic bullshit to go through as well i 'd imagine there is , but i 'd be curious as well about the details . 
  if you can read romanian , here 's [ a book that might interest you ] ( http://www.polirom.ro/catalog/carte/mai-romani-decit-romanii-de-ce-se-indragostesc-strainii-de-romania-4996/ ), 
  [ indeed ] ( http://www.minorlooneytunes.com/pictures/finster003.jpg ), 
  crosspost to / r/unitedkingdom as well , 
  every country sends its share of clowns to the ep . 
  we do it , the dutch do it , the brits will do it in record numbers next year . 
  such is life . 
  is this douchey tone really necessary ? 
  where did i say they were replaced by people with phds ? 
  old nationalists voted prm , the younger nationalist demographic does not vote with prm , but with ppdd ( but ppdd is populist , not fascist ) . 
  this fucker is a member of prm , not of ppdd . 
  ergo , he will not become mep again . 
  i think they just sell them to the jews . 
  the greater romania party that he 's a member of is polling at about 3 % ( quite low compared to the 10 % -15 % they used to get ) , and its electorate either died ( many old nationalists voted for them ) or moved on to other populists . 
  how so ? 
   it has an exclave , possibly the above mentioned nagorno-karabakh ? 
  [ nakhchivan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nakhchivan_autonomous_republic ), 
   they do n't have any problems mixing with the `` locals '' really depends which roma we are talking about . 
  most roma do n't have a problem , but the gabor gypsies of transylvania wo n't even mix with other kinds of roma , let alone non-roma . 
   we do n't do grades in the uk not my problem you 're ignorant regarding the rest of the world . 
  i could have sworn you knew romania inside-out by your earlier comment . 
   checking wikipedia said grade 4 is aged 9-10 so that still makes you wrong . 
  but let 's count together : if little fitz starts grade i at age 7 ( like most romanian children ) , he starts gr.ii at age 8 , gr.iii at age 9 and gr.iv at 10 , then he finishes it at age 11 . 
  comprende ? 
  but if little fitz has problems in math and english , he might not get to graduate 8 ^ th grade . 
  so the mean people people at the statistics bureau will include fitz in the `` graduated 4t ^ th grade '' category . 
  many ignorant people will laugh at poor fitzy , thinking he left school at 10 years . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  the end . 
    27 % graduated 4th grade ,  = 50 percent are pulled from school by aged 8 or never attended school . 
  1st grade starts at age 7 . 
  so `` 27 % graduated 4th grade '' means they are still in school at age 11 . 
  so , once again kids :  23 % no school , 27 % graduated 4th grade , 33 % graduated 8th grade means  23 % no school , 27 % in school at age 11 , 33 % in school at age 15 anyway . 
  27 % graduating 4th grade does not automatically mean they are pulled from school they can very well be pulled from school at the beginning of 8th grade , and still fall into this category . 
  so saying 50 % are pulled by age 11 would still be stupid on your part . 
  you really are keen on embarrassing yourself today , are n't ya ? 
   saying 95 percent of gypsies do n't graduate school they do n't graduate ** high - ** school . 
  but graduating high-school is not mandatory , as evident by the 60 % non-roma who do n't either . 
   with 50 percent either unschooled or pulled from school by age 8 i said no such thing . 
  you really do seem to have problems with english . 
  re-read untill you understand . 
   coupled with the fact their speaking a bastardised creole of romani they do n't .
