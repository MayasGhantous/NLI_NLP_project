  they speak ( about 40 % of them anyway ) various dialects of romani , the same way people in your country speak various dialects of english . 
  there is no para-romani here . 
  also multilingualism seems to give you problems . 
  no wonder you have trouble grasping more complex issues . 
  a [ brown triangle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_concentration_camp_badges#table_of_camp_inmate_markings ) maybe ? 
   not overly educated on your own countries culture are you ? 
  let me help on that . 
  what you linked does not contradict what i said ( and it does n't specifically adress romania btw ) . 
  but you seem to have problems comprehending you own mother tongue . 
  let me repeat it again : more than half of gypsies in romania do not speak any form of romani . 
  their mother tongue is romanian or hungarian . 
  of those who do speak romani as a mother tongue , most if not all learn the host population 's language as well , early on and to a good degree . 
  they are multilingual ( most likely a confusing concept for one such as yourself ) . 
  so next time you try to mimic knowledge , make sure your link is relevant . 
  i met an american roma in paris once ( family was from czechia originally ) . 
  nice kid . 
   imagine american gang culture except you 're born into it many blacks are actually born in the ghetto , surrounded by gangs . 
   the people who raised you speak a different language to the country you 're in and it 's the only language you know and you 're not allowed to mix or go to school so you have zero chance of learning the countries language you 're in and the only way you 've been taught to survive is to beg or commit crime . 
  this is so full off bullshit i do n't know where to begin . 
  i 'll take western romania , because it 's where i live . 
  first of all , in romania , only about 40 % of roma actually speak romany . 
  of those who speak who speak romany many , if not all , speak good romanian ( minus the accent ) , and in transylvania , they are fluent in both romanian and hungarian . 
  in keeping with the stereotype , if the roma want to live a life of crime , they need to know the host population 's language . 
  you ca n't con somebody if you ca n't sweetalk them . 
  regarding school , the demographics is as follows :  23 % no school , 27 % graduated 4th grade , iar 33 % graduated 8th grade , and 95 % did not graduate high-school . 
  ( for the rest of the population the numbers are 2 % -11 % -24 % with 60 % not graduating highschool ) . 
  ^ \\ ( [ source ] ( http://www.soros.ro/ro/comunicate_detaliu.php?comunicat=22 ) ) while they are under-educated they in no way suffer from linguistic isolation . 
  you 're story is bullshit . 
  do n't worry . 
  after next year 's euro-elections , this dude will never be an mep ever again . 
   you guys [ ... ] up north . 
  thanks for making me feel nordic !, 
   if people don '' t pay attention to who they vote in people do n't vote for the greater romania party by accident . 
  there is a segment of the populations here that actually likes and votes people like [ corneliu vadim tudor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_vadim_tudor ) and [ gigi becali ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gigi_becali ) ( at the time running on the grp list ) same as in other countries . 
  looking at the [ 2009 eu election in romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2009_%28romania%29 ) the party percentages were roughly equal to what you 'd see in national elections , even if the turnout was low . 
  since then , the populist vote rose to 15 % , if we judge by the [ 2012 legislative elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_legislative_election,_2012 ) . 
  the one election that was anomalous was 2008 when the nationalist vote was split , and the grp was in decline , but there was no serious contender ( although gigi becali 's party did take enough votes away so they could miss the 5 % threshold ) . 
  the only ones who actually benefited from voter apathy were the hungarian minority who have a much more disciplined voting population , and rose from the usual 6 % to 8.6 % . 
  them and the preside n't daughter , who got elected [ as an `` independent '' somehow ] ( http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-5791833-how-daughter-romanian-president-basescu-will-elected-mep-independent-with-help-from-basescus-supporting-party.htm ) . 
  on a side note , this clown did not get elected in the 2009 election . 
  he replaced gigi becali as mep in january-february 2013 , after becali got sent to jail . 
  what do you mean ? 
   romans ( and ancient greeks ) lived a long long long time ago . 
  back then things were different . 
  more different than people realize . 
  a stroll through / r/askhistorians can be very mindblowing,

  should the people of basarabia have a say in this ? 
  what if they do n't want to `` be back '' ? 
   some unofficial polls put over 90 % of moldovan citizens in favour for union your link :  over 93 % of * internet users * say yes bessarabian moldovan union with romania !, 
  ...  according to an online survey conducted among readers publika.md portal this is like making a poll on reddit and then saying that ron paul has a real chance in winning the us elections . 
  more realistic figures , taken through [ an opinion poll in september last year ] ( http://social.moldova.org/news/sondaj-15-dintre-moldoveni-doresc-unirea-cu-romnia-233374-rom.html ) put the desire to unite at about 15 % . 
  while these opinion polls might be skewed in the other direction , i think they are closer to the truth then `` online polls '' which are notoriously unreliable . 
  ** found june 2011 gallup polls , which would be more reliable ( [ pdf , page 36 ] ( http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2011%20june%206%20survey%20of%20moldova%20public%20opinion,%20january%2024-february%207,%202011.pdf ) ) :  * excluding the impact of potential moldovan membership in the european union , do you support unification of moldova with romania ?

  google translated :  despite the unknowns on the participation and achievement of a quorum [ san marino ] seems split down the middle between those for and against . 
  on the one hand there are those who see in the isolation of san marino [ a ] situation is no longer out of the story : `` we are geographically in europe , it is absurd to stand out - says a student - i 've already had problems , for example with calls and with competitions by which we , not europeans , we are kept out . '', 
  in terms of opposites - also supported by the league 's deputy of forl\u00ec , gianluca pini , who came in person in the last hours of the campaign - the fear is that the republic of the titan squashed by larger states and possible `` invasion '' of foreigners : `` we can not stand , '' said one of the supporters . 
  `` we said no to napoleon bonaparte and his flattery and history has proved us right , we will say no even to merkel , '' says another . 
  all seem to agree on one thing , that sums gianluca pini : `` the issue of transparency of the banks in this case has nothing to do [ with it ] . 
  since 2007 , san marino has begun to be more transparent in the [ case of banks ] '', 
  found this : http://www.elezioni.sm/on-line/home/referendum/normativa-in-vigore.html although quickly looking through the laws i have n't found anything on the 32 % quorum, 
  i think you are right . 
  [ this site ] ( http://www.smtvsanmarino.sm/san-marino/elezioni/referendum-2013/risultati ) says above the results that :  3924 si mancanti al quorum ( 10657 )  20,22 % di si su un quorum del 32 % which i thinks means :  3924 yes lacking from quorum ( 10657 )  20,22 % yes of a quorum of 32 %, 
  wonder if there were any opinion polls ? 
  even neighbours like hungary . 
  many people in romania will admit hungary is way ahead in things like infrastructure , overal economic development , and that in general hungarians are more \u201e ordered '' when it comes to laws .
