  it 's [ these guys ] ( http://romafacts.uni-graz.at/index.php/culture/culture-3/the-gabor-in-transylvania--romania ) . 
  there are many in my hometown as well and they do n't cause trouble , but are very insular . 
  this is one of my biggest problems with the situation . 
  many succesfull roma blend in the majority , so this means there is no `` elite class '' that can serve as an example for the other roma . 
  i read somewhere that a roma `` inteligentsia '' of sorts started forming in interwar romania , but that went to shit with ww2 . 
  so i 'm hoping the stability of post-cold-war europe will see the rise of such a class of people from amongst the roma . 
  i 've already seen some signs of this happening in romania . 
  ngos and even nascent political movements have started showing up . 
  i read of some dude who started a political party and was trying to gain some strenght in the last local elections ( unfortunately mainstream political forces were violently against this as the roma , being poorly educated are an easily buyable voter demographic ) . 
  still i hope this proliferates . 
  i was in spain this summer , and caught a newsstory where [ a navarrese roma group ( gaz kalo ) ] ( http://gazkalo.org/educacion/ ) heald some meeting and then went on air and held a conference where they were urging the romas to focus on education as that is the key to succes . 
  we really need these positive roma groups . 
  re-read my comment . 
  i was talking about a subset of roma who are not `` criminals and vagabonds '' but who have different issues that the majority consider unacceptable . 
  traditional roma are just like the amish `` craftsmen who try to minimize aspects of modern society influencing their own communities '' and `` do n't bother other people '' but they do have problems that are seen as `` backwards '' . 
   on the bad side , it kind of perpetuates stereotypes ( sort of ) problem is this that this reinforces the idea that being roma is bad , so it 's a big negative for the people who are visibly roma and poor , but are trying to be decent citizens . 
  it creates anymosity within the majority population , because they do not see positive examples of roma , so they think their xenophobia is justified . 
  in short , it hurts those `` left behind '' . 
  i do n't think i can give you a definite answer to that , tbh . 
  even the romanian roma are of many sorts , with varying types of problems . 
  not many itinerant roma out there . 
  not in eastern europe at least . 
  virtually all roma in romania are sedentary . 
  the commies took care of that . 
  same in the rest of eastern europe . 
   i think if they are being pulled from school before they are 16 without good reason and they are not getting a good education at home , then the parents should be deemed unfit . 
  i think it 's more a question of the states coming and taking the kids to school . 
  after all , schooling up to certain level is * mandatory * . 
   failing to give your children a proper education is evidence that you should n't be a parent . 
  there are so many discussions that start from this sentence . 
  i agree in principle , and i am of the opinion that many human beings should not have ( had ) children . 
  but just like with abandoning the amish community , abandoning the traditional roma community means being cast into the world to fend for yourself with virtually zero friends and family . 
  hence the reason why most amish choose to stay . 
  it 's not a fair choice at all if you ask me . 
  [ already been tried ] ( http://romani.uni-graz.at/rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml ) and it has n't really worked . 
  because if the good ones assimilate , you 're always left with the bad ones representing the ethnicity . 
  imagine if all the black that got out of `` the ghetto '' suddenly turned white . 
  you 'd think blacks can never assimilate . 
  also even if a culture is riddled with regressive customs , it does n't mean you have to abandon all of it . 
  you only have to abandon the bad shit . 
  this is also true with other cultures . 
  romanians have to abandon the regressive shit in order become proper `` europeans '' but nobody tells romanians to change their entire culture . 
  this is not just the `` nation 's collective opinion '' . 
  it 's estimates made by roma rights groups and other ngos . 
   though i do accept there might be problems with the census . 
  it would be nice to hear what those problems are and why it might be underestimating the ` true ' number . 
  given the negative stereotypes associated with the roma , many of them are reluctant to declare their ethnicity . 
  especially if they are educated , assimilated and and are romanian ( or hungarian ) speaking . 
  they can easily pass as non-roma . 
  found this quickly : http://www.edrc.ro/resurse/rapoarte/roma_of_romania.pdf  other estimates ; up to 1.8 million ( 7.9 per cent ) . 
  some organisations have put the figure as high as 2,5 million ( minority rights group , 1997 : 240 ) . 
  the research institute for quality of life estimates a number between 1,452,700 and 1,588,552 ( hetero-identified ) in 1998 , among them there are 922,465 to 1,002,381 ( self identified ) ( the research institute for quality of life , 2000 ) . 
   it 's weird for me but i think that the evangelical church helped more than the government in integrating them . 
  and i am an atheist from a catholic country . 
  i agree , and i 'm as intrigued as you . 
   plus whether or not there is a cycle of criminality . 
  there might not be a cycle of criminality involved ( i 'm taking some of the traditional roma as an example ) , but chances of integrating are slim due to : conservative values , superstition , lack of education ( girls pulled from school after 5-6th grade ) . 
  there is lot of criticizeable stuff there without aspects of criminality being involved . 
   so long as they know they can leave and that there is a world outside of their community then i guess i 'm ok with it . 
  what if they are raised to fear the outside world ? 
   there 's not that many roma people in romania ( ~ 600,000 according to the 2011 romania census ) unnoficial estimates place the number at around 2.000.000 , and most romanians agree that number is closer to the truth . 
   it 's people who subscribe to the romani culture who are a problem . 
  depends on what parts of romani culture they subscribe to . 
  there are a lot of gabor roma who are quite conservative ( patriarchal , isolated from wider comunity , arrage marriages for their children at an early ages , little education , especially for the girls ) but are functional members of sociaty more or less . 
  they are skilled craftsmen , ( tinkers and such ) , and rarely cause trouble if ever . 
  ( some of them are embracing evangelical christianity and are abandoning arranged marriages and keep their kids in school longer ) . 
  from what i 've read , the finnish gypsies are somewhat like that ( keep a lot of customs , but do n't cause a lot of trouble and work ) . 
  now there are other gypsies who are half-assimilated and live in the periphery of big cities . 
  the traditional roma look down on these roma as lesser beings . 
  these are roma who have more in common with `` ghetto culture '' than `` roma culture '' . 
  or better yet , it 's a mixture of the bad in both ( thuggishness combined with disconnect from wider society ) . 
  the idea if you get rid of a `` bad roma culture '' things can be fixed is really an oversimplification ( though it does have a grain of truth ) . 
  but the roma are a very heterogenious ethnicity , and there are different problems with different subgroups . 
   the support system for kids without parents is , admittedly , pretty awful in most places , but would you rather be in a care system like that with some kind of a future a head of you or trapped in a life of squaller and crime with your genetic family . 
  i do n't think kids raised in orphanages in romania have a better chance at life then those raised with their roma parents , tbh . 
  honest question : do you think amish children should be taken away from their parents ? 
  i ask because a lot of traditional roma are similar the amish ( patriarchal , isolationist ) . 
   she threatened to `` punish '' us because we were we were tired paying for romas holidays with our tax money and not actively cheerleading for mass immigration this is bullshit and you know it . 
  what she said is that you ca n't kick out a group of people from france because of their ethnicity . 
  if you want to kick out the gypsies , you have to do it on a case per case basis provided they have broken the law . 
  if they have n't , you ca n't kick them out just because they are gypsies , as that would breach eu law . 
  and breaching eu law is why you would get `` punished '' .

  used to be bigger ( see [ belgian province of luxemburg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg_%28province%29 ) ) . 
  they are trilingual ( french , german and letzeburgish ) . 
  letzeburgish is the ( quite recently ) standardized form of the local german dialect . 
  large portuguese population . 
  some per capita statistics are fucked up because lots of germans and french buy stuff that is cheaper there . 
  well , since we 're on the subject of alphabets , i 've got 2 tidbits : 1 . 
  romanian used to be [ written with cyrillic ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/romanian_cyrillic_-_lord%27s_prayer_text.svg/1000px-romanian_cyrillic_-_lord%27s_prayer_text.svg.png ) up until the 19th century . 
  then we decided that because we are latin , we must write with a latin script . 
  but we made transition slowly . 
  so we had a period in the 1850s when we had [ a mongrel latin-cyrillic alphabet ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/alfbtranzitie.jpeg ) .
