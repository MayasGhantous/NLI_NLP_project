  there were also cases of [ different scripts being used for titles ( latin ) and content ( mixed ) ] ( http://tiparituriromanesti.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/dacia-literara-iasi-1840/ ) . 
  the hungarians used to have a [ runic script of turkic origin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_hungarian_alphabet ) before they settled down and westernized , adopting the latin alphabet . 
  in what is now central romania ( [ szeklerland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeklerland ) , eastern transylvania ) , the writing was used well into the middle ages . 
  now it 's used mainly , but not exclusively , by nationalist , because [ motherfuckin ' runes ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/csikszereda_city_limit_sign_rovas_script.jpg ) .

  answered [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o3m5a/has_anyone_travelled_extensively_across_europe/ ) not so long ago , 
   ethnic identities are a product of the dynamics of a society , including its economics , demographics , politics , and exposure to ideas like women 's rights , religion , etc. 
  some other dynamics that strengthen in-group/out-group identities are immigration , economic competition over resources between 2 populations and so on . 
   one could n't freeze one 's culture for all time even if one wanted to . 
  i 'm with you on this one . 
  i was n't arguing otherwise . 
   on mobility in 1800 : millions of people moved from europe to the americas in search of new opportunities and freedom from oppressive regimes . 
  point taken . 
  i was thinking more about pre-industrial revolution mobility vs post-industrial revolution mobility . 
  otoh , you mentioned how `` people moved relatively freely around europe '' . 
  most large scale migrations inside europe in the 2nd milenium ad were state sponsored migrations ( colonisation/ethnic cleansing ) , or rural-to-urban migrations . 
  romania did the same in 1866 , when we got rid of our local [ prince cuza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuza ) . 
  worked out quite ok for a while ( until the 30s ) . 
  oh , get a room you two !, 
   in a relatively homogenous environment ( eg relatively wealthy europeans ) i thinks it 's a lot more about perception than actual homogeneity . 
  switzerland is heterogenous ethno-linguistically and religiously , but there is a sense of shared identity which keeps them together . 
  yugoslavia was also ethnically and religiously heterogenous , but the narative of the shared `` yugoslav identity '' blew up as soon as tito was cold in the grave . 
  now we have the a sort of european proto-identity materializing which gives us the sense that we are all `` europeans '' . 
   cultural homogeneity would be lost ( is this right only reserved for third worlders ? ), 
  third world countries are hardly homogenous ... 
   this is getting silly . 
  italy and germany are younger than the usa . 
  that 's like saying europe is only 50 years old because the eu is a recent political entity . 
  germany as a state might be new , but there were `` german states '' ( hre anyone ? ), 
  before that . 
  sure , ( ethnic ) identities are ideological constructs , but i do n't see the relevance of this . 
  would you mind expanding on this ? 
   before that , people moved relatively freely around europe . 
  yeah , but you have to take into account the degree of mobility in 1800 as compared to today . 
  people were glued to their land so very few people traveled long distances . 
   the post simply points to the absence of a moral argument for excluding others . 
  you do n't need a moral argument for it . 
  it 's simple pragmatic thought . 
  too many foreigners arriving too quickly creates tension . 
   perhaps a world with 3 billion people who would deserve refugee status by our own standards is the problem perhaps , but opening borders will not fix the root cause of those 3 billion people 's poverty . 
  and in schengen , no less . 
  so does romania , which has no relevant far-right party in parliament or outside of it . 
   however , a report scheduled for adoption by the parliament \u00b4 s constitutional affairs committee seeks to establish the institution \u00b4 s right to determine where it holds its meetings . 
  if , as expected , the report is approved , it would commit the parliament to initiate a treaty-revision procedure . 
  love the way parliament is asserting itself . 
  speaking of which , i [ translated an article on the subject a while ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10gjll/the_story_of_a_forthcoming_parliamentary_coup/ ) , for the curious . 
  also took a stroll in the \u201e european parliament 's constitutional affairs commity 's [ draft reports page ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/afco/draft-reports.html#menuzone ) and found [ this interesting paper called * \u201e draft report on relations between the european parliament and the institutions representing the national governments '' * ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bcomparl%2bpe-519.484%2b01%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen ) . 
  some excerpts :  d. whereas , in agreement with parliament 's authorities , and in particular through exchanges of letters , president van rompuy has sought to take account of information and transparency requirements as far as possible : he has personally met parliament 's committee chairs , rapporteurs and sherpas to discuss a number of important topics ; he has replied to written questions ; he has provided regular reports on european council meetings and had numerous contacts with group chairs ;  e. whereas this practice is worth formalising so that it can serve as a precedent for the future ; whereas it should also be improved , given that : [ ... ] on an eu banking supervisory authority , the european council adopted two contradictory positions one year apart , which it could have avoided by taking greater account of parliament 's position ; whereas negotiations on the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework saw the legislative process held to ransom : the legally required unanimity in the council could only be achieved by pre-empting certain major policy choices in the regulations on the policies to be financed , which , in some areas , reduces parliament 's role to one of merely amending secondary provisions ; [ ... ]  [ the european parliament ... ]  2 \\ . 
  is of the opinion that , other than in cases of exceptional urgency , any meeting of the european council should be preceded by a debate in parliament , with the president of the european council coming to present the subjects on the agenda in person ; believes that parliament should organise its work so as to make known its opinion on these subjects in good time ;  5 \\ . 
  proposes that the president of the european council and the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy be invited to take part once a year in the debate on the state of the union , together with the president of the commission ;, 
  afaik , the lithuanian alphabet lacks w , which is very present in the polish alphabet . 
  a reasonable compromise would seem to use the lithuanian alphabet + other letters of the basic latin alphabet ( i think only q and w are missing ) . 
  that way they get their w but lithuanian does n't adopt all the funky polish letters , which can be written as their closest basic equivalent . 
  \u0104 becomes a , \u0141 becomes l , \u0179 and \u017b become z. ma\u0142gorzata runiewicz-wardyn becomes malgorzata runiewicz-wardyn which is close enough to the polish original as one can get in any foreign country . 
  i believe this is what we do in romania where we have a lot of hungarians , which in turn have a lot of letters the romanian alphabet does n't have . 
  y is virtually useless in romanian ( only used in [ some words of foreign origin ] ( http://dexonline.ro/lista-cuvinte/y ) ) but hungarian ca n't do without it . 
  so t\u0151k\u00e9s l\u00e1szl\u00f3 becomes [ tokes laszlo ] ( http://www.realitatea.net/cum-a-ajuns-tokes-laszlo-sa-vorbeasca-obscen-in-conferinte-de-presa_1291640.html ) in official documents . 
  otoh , i think the lithuanian ( and latvian ) policies on transliteration of names are a bit more restrictive than what we do . 
   that 's how english ended up with its atrocious spelling rules , by picking up loanwords without modifying either spelling or pronunciation . 
  not really . 
  most of it is spelling that remained unchanged while the pronunciation shifted . 
  otoh , my aunt who has greek origins and a greek family name , got the final s put back at the end of her name when she emigrated to greece ( at one time greek names were roumanianized by dropping the final s ) . 
  so avgerinos became avgherino and then back to avgerinos ( no greek keyboard , but you get the picture ), 
   the `` dogs are n't jews to be sent to auschwitz '' comment by an ong was probably the most outrageous , but hardly a surprise . 
  i 've heard a jewish animal lover say something like this ( someone whose grandma was an auschwitz survivor ) . 
  i felt my brain is gon na explode . 
   tommy robinson , creator and frontman of the english defence league , quits organisation and joins up with quilliam , the muslim-run , anti-islamic extremism organisation . 
  this is interesting , and a somewhat strange alliance . 
  any more details ? 
  yeah . 
  sometimes it 's not even immigrants . 
  there is a lot of xenophobia against internal migrants from the north caucasus , and that area is inside russia .

   sometimes net contributers ( which i suppose kaliningrad might be ) in a federation tend to want more autonomy . 
  again , i was just asking the question because of this tendency . 
  i think what kaliningrad lacks here is a sense of being different in some way from the rest of russia . 
  there is no historic \u201e kaliningradian '' identity , no \u201e narrative '' of an identity different from that of other russians . 
  sure , it 's an exclave , but there is no local sense of self to develop an us-versus-them narrative . 
  they do n't see themselves as paying for \u201e others '' .

  tbh , i had no idea we were that close to the 2004 states regarding gdp/capita at point of entry . 
   well , then you agree that perhaps bulgaria and romania were not ready ? 
  every sensible romanian agreed in 2007 that we were n't ready for eu . 
  i 'm sure bulgarians did the same . 
   with regards to economical development , corruption , gdp/capita , etc. 
  while i agree that the conditions of entry need to be a bit higher , i 'm curious how one could set an objective ( numerical ) measurement for corruption ? 
  % of shadow economy ? 
   in ten years they will be like finland said no one ever ... 
   but you ca n't judge a group from a fraction of it . . that 's prejudice and not considered a nice thing .

  also , you seem pretty prejudiced yourself , against human rights organizations .
