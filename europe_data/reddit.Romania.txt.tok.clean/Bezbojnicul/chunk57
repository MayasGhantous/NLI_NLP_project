   if somebody is begging for money i will give them what spare change i have . 
  i think this will do nothing but encourage this phenomenon . 
   whatever they use the money for , at least when i give money to them i know they get the money they mostly get jack . 
  it 's passed up the organizational structure . 
  if what i saw this summer in venice is anything to go by - quite different from the begging in romania i must say - , the begging in western europe is a very-very organized scam . 
  you are not helping the lady you are giving the money to . 
  scrap iron . 
   roma do n't want to live in houses funny , given how many of them live in houses . 
   like the name implies a federation of two states , bosnia and herzegovina actually the two states are `` the federation of bosnia-hertegovina '' and `` republica srpska '' afaik . 
  bosnia and hertegovina are just the two historic regions that make up the state , and fo not overlap with the political entities . 
   or french is the 1st most common studied foreign language ? 
  most likely this . 
   eventhough it 's mostly fun and tease now . 
  not in the east it ai n't ... 
  tomorrow in the news : `` more austerity for latvia , says merkel '', 
   dog shit , really ? 
  that 's a major point in paris ' disfavor ? 
  come on . 
  sounds like [ paris syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ), 
   reportedly , it 's hard to get started as an independent architect . 
  it might be prudent to look into employment at an architect 's office first . 
  oh , i 'm not even contemplating doing it solo until i have some more years under my belt and a firmer grasp of the technical vocabulary in the local language ( and a firmer grasp of the local language generally ) . 
  i 've looked online for job ads , and found a couple ( one near kotrijk ) , baring the fact i ca n't speak dutch ( yet ) . 
   in addition , expect a gradual shift towards adapting existing buildings rather building new ones . 
  yeah , it 's a trend all over europe . 
  fortunately i do have some experience with such work . 
  thanks for the tip though . 
  [ comment on r/science ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nz5hb/peter_higgs_and_francois_englert_win_nobel/ccne7vd ) :  can say that lots of my colleagues at cern are smiling this afternoon :-), 
   both flanders and the netherlands are doing fine too . 
  i 'm not too sure about the netherlands but the it sector in flanders has been steadily growing . 
  the services sector is quite big here as well as the petrochemical one in areas around antwerp . 
  any idea about the building sector . 
  i 'm an architect and i 'm interested to move round them parts ( antwerp ) in about a year . 
  i personallz prefer ` yurp ', 
  probably the liberals . 
  while i would n't be caught dead voting for them on the national level , their euro mps , especially [ renate weber ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/39713/renate_weber_home.html;jsessionid=6b5861c2aeaef17fdbfdbfb1cfd2ea31.node1 ) , are quite to my liking , and have done a good job in brussels . 
   like in denmark you can not have \u063a\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u064a\u062f on your driver 's license so i do n't know why turkey has to accept another set of script . 
  arabic and danish are two different scripts . 
  kurmanci and turkish are two variations on the same script ( latin ) . 
  the situations are not analogous . 
   i do n't know why turkey has to accept another set of script . 
  it 's not about accepting another script . 
  it 's about not banning 3 letters of the latin alphabet . 
   by the way , does romania allow the use of hungarian letters like \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00d3 , \u00d6 , \u0150 to accommodate its largest minority ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i actually tried googling to see if it does , but did n't find anything . 
  also , do n't asume that if romania does not allow these leters , i agree with it . 
  plus the fact that \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00d3 , \u00d6 , \u0150 , \u00da , \u00dc , \u0170 and \u00cd can be replaced with a , e , o , u and i in a way in which x , w , q can not . 
  there are orthodox churches which belong to various eastern european churches , but there is no `` belgian orthodox church '' in the same way there is a `` czech and slovak o.c. '' . 
  that was my point . 
   who made this map ? 
  source given over at r/linguistics : http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?alphabets  i am detecting a bias tbh . 
  yeah , seems quite `` cyrillocentric '', 
   i could understand it , if it was a completely unrelated alphabet like amharic or the arabic abjad , but cyrillic is pretty related . 
  so is the arabic script actually . 
  well , as far as languages go , georgian is unrelated to indo-european languages ( it 's part of the kartvelian language family ) , but armenian is very much an indo-european language . 
  but the current topic is writing systems , and afaik , both the armenian and the georgian alphabets are derived from the phoenician alphabet , just like the greek , latin and cyrillic alphabets . 
  i said it was active now , and was refering to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_and_slovak_orthodox_church ) . 
  you said `` there was no orthodox church active in the czech lands until 19-20th century '' which does n't negate my point , that there is one now , in the 21st century , small as it may be . 
  i did n't bring up 9th c. moravia . 
  i know . 
  plus hungary has no comparable orthodox church , so why it 's painted that way is beyond me . 
  but my feeling is that it 's related to current churches , not historic ones . 
  yeah , it lacks many letters , plus the armenian and georgian alphabets , which many would consider `` european alphabets '' as well . 
  does n't say it has to be significant . 
  i agree that it gives undo weight to the orthodox minority , but the truth is that there is [ an orthodox church covering the czechoslovak lands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_and_slovak_orthodox_church ) which uses cyrillic in liturgy . 
   there was no orthodox church active in the czech lands until 19-20th century . 
  that is irrelevant . 
  re-read the map and the comments in this thread . 
  most probably has to do with the orthodox churches active in those regions , not with 9th c. great moravia . 
  might be something related to the [ polish orthodox church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_orthodox_church ), 
   you ca n't be a black native american because that two label generally has a racial requirement . 
  [ you kinda can ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_indians_in_the_united_states ) . 
  a lot of countries address this issue by having `` letters x , w , q only used in loan-words / words of foreign origin '' , so this way all the letters of the latin alphabet are there . 
  hell , even turkish uses the letters , unofficially . 
  says so in the article . 
  so the question is why should n't the letters be included in the turkish alphabet , when they are already used as it is, 
   ... and we had a magnitude 5.5 earthquake last night which woke up the southern and eastern parts of the country at 4:40 in the morning . 
  * there were also a number of smaller earthquakes one after another around gala\u021bi and people have been speculating as to their origin ( man-made ? ),

   i do n't know about the separate teaching , but it might have to do with an existing language barrier . 
  this happened to children pf romanian-speaking roma as well , where there is no language barrier .
