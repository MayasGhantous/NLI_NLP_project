   as per the australian example , i said similar . 
  i did n't say exactly like what the aussies did . 
  i said similar . 
  but i also said it 's a shit idea because of the massive potential for abuse ( like in australia ) . 
  the [ habsburgs tried this in the times of maria theresa ] ( http://romani.uni-graz.at/rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml ) . 
  not very successful . 
   it has to come from within . 
  i 'd say it has to come from both sides . 
  the saddest thing is that a lot of integrated roma try to hide their identity . 
  the only ones left are the visible bad examples , which only reinforce the stereotype . 
  this lack of exposure also deprives the roma community of positive role models , which , i think , are essential for pushing a minority such as this to better itself . 
   do you deny there is a problem of course not . 
   did you simply want to address the stupid generalisation ? 
  indeed . 
   but always one step behind the west because of pickpoketing gypsies . 
  there are many reasons we are behind the west . 
  pickpocketing gypsies is very low on that list . 
  i think my philosophy professor in college was roma too . 
  also , [ france 's `` best apprentice in her field '' for 2012 was a roma ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20120403-illegal-roma-teenager-wins-french-best-apprentice-award-immigration-senate-france ) . 
  and many more examples can spring to mind . 
  actually , the overwhelming majority of gypsies are not nomadic anymore . 
   i always thought there 's a lot of hate and misunderstanding in bulgaria towards the romani and thought it 's happening because we are somehow a backwards country but now i see we 're not really that different from all other europeans who are supposed to be somehow be ahead of us as a society . 
  same here with romania . 
   but it seems like allowing these countries to join the eu is only benefical to them . . and not to the eu . 
  well , we already joined in 2007 . 
   let alone opening their borders . 
  as your story illustrates , the current border is not really stopping the pickpockets . 
  otoh , it does affect the free flow of goods . 
  italy does n't look that bad tbh . 
  some languages are co-oficial in some autonomous areas . 
  given the lack of comments , here are two threads on the subject : * / r/france : [ so , what do you think about the ongoing row over romani people in france ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1na81i/so_what_do_you_think_about_the_ongoing_row_over/ ) * / r/romania : [ why do other european countries dislike the idea of romania joining the schengen area ? ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/1ndkgc/why_do_other_european_countries_dislike_the_idea/ ) . 
  are the other european countries basing the fact that romania has a large roma population in their decision in whether to allow romania join the schengen and work area ? 
  kick french guyana out of the eu !, 
   if you try hard enough , there are plenty of things to do . 
  guess the 2 + million romanians working abroad just did n't try enough ... 
   well all five have authoritarian long serving presidents except kyrgyzstan who went through not 1 , but 2 arab-spring-esque events ( [ 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tulip_revolution ) and [ 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_kyrgyzstan_revolution ) ) . 
   that article says 61 % actually the percentage is higher . 
  the 61 % is for harghita , covasna and mure\u015f counties , but only the eastern third of mure\u015f was historically part of szeklerland . 
  the other 2/3 are not historically szekler , and is mostly inhabited by romanians . 
  fear of setting a precedent for possible hungarian secessionist in [ transylvania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ) / [ szeklerland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeklerland ) . 
   spain does n't recognize kosovo neither does romania , slovakia and cyprus ( iirc ), 
  i 'm not sure how your answer adreses my question ... 
  ignoring the fact that ethnic profiling would be out of the question , who decides who is a roma ? 
  done !, 
  i do n't know tbh . 
  and what would be the equivalent of detox here ? 
   they are more concerned about cheap romanian workers going aboard work restrictions [ are going to be lifted on 1 jan 2014 ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/abroad/work-permits/ ) anyway . 
   and of course , gypsies . 
  the current border between romania and hungary ( schengen ) does not keep the roma out of schengen , as evident from all the scandals . 
  so this reason smells a bit like bs . 
  the impact is way bigger on trucks that have to stop at the border . 
  individuals traveling , it 's a 1 minute stop , max . 
  well , you can complete the list with things i forgot , or expand the points i mentioned . 
  that 's what i do , in case there already is a * romania * list . 
  what people need to realize is that the solution to roma problem will take time . 
  it 's not going to be solved in 5-10 years . 
  it will take many decades , and sustained effort from both parties . 
  also the whole roma issue is a convenient excuse . 
  schengen membership or not , the roma can reach france just as easily . 
  ** romania ** * schengen membership for romania and bulgaria opposed . 
  this time by france , citing the lack of roma integration . 
  [ our politicians disagree ] ( http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=154022 ) . 
  * [ romanian media mogul and politician voiculescu gets five-year jail sentence in fraudulent privatization case ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-media-mogul-and-politician-voiculescu-gets-five-year-jail-sentence-in-fraudulent-privatization-case/107127/ ) ( said he will appeal . 
  also his media is trying to make a mockery of the verdict by calling it \u201e the telepathy trial '' , due to some crafty quote-mining ) * [ google changes logo to celebrate famous romanian singer maria tanase 's centennial ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/google-changes-logo-to-celebrate-famous-romanian-singer-maria-tanases-centennial/107002/ ) ( listen to some [ audio samples ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-song-remembering-maria-tanase/107176/ ) ) * still a lot of talk on the subject of the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 gold mine and the euthanisation of stray dogs . 
  given how `` mersi '' is colloqial in romanian , interacting in france feels like i 'm super friends with everybody . 
  `` b\u0103 '' is way more common in romanian as well . 
  also `` m\u0103 '' . 
  is frequent where i live ( western romania ) . 
  both foreign , we have n't even romanianized the spelling for the first one yet . 
  also variations on `` servus '' are common . 
  somewhat foreign as well . 
  til , 
  i ask because it 's used in some regional variants of romanian as `` yo ! '' . 
  [ apparently ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/bre/423188 ) it 's found in other balkan languages as well ( aromanian , meglenoromanian , bulgarian , greek , turkish ) . 
   bre is this a form of `` yo !, 
  now you should . 
  enjoy . 
  now i want a langos . 
  i should grab one when i finish work . 
  `` danish '' can mean both `` ethnic dane '' or `` citizen of denmark '' . 
  it 's obvious in this context it was used with the second meaning . 
   santorini , greece is cheating capital of the world according to new survey . 
  i first thought this was going to be about taxes ... 
   i 've never known , or even seen a gypsy in america . 
  met a dude in paris , his parents were czech roma who emigrated to the us when he was little , but his grandma still lived in the czech republic . 
  had a nice conversation with the dude . 
  he was a normal everyday guy . 
  actually , i 'd say the west 's hesitation has actually strengthened the wrong kind of rebels . 
  recent news : [ eleven islamist rebel groups in syria have announced they do not recognise the authority of the main opposition alliance , the national coalition ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24239779 ), 
  in a lot of countries they were over-represented in certain professions and were a source of envy . 
  they did this even back in the middle ages , 
   viviane reding , european commissioner for justice and fundamental rights , meanwhile , accused the french government of using the issue as a smokescreen on the day it is unveiling its austerity budget . 
  `` every time people want to talk about important things like the budget or debts , we find the roma , '' she told france info radio . 
  she said france has signed up to eu rules and is not making use of `` 50 billion euros '' on the table to deal with the roma question . 
  i really like mrs. reding , 
  i can recommend a good urologist from my home town who 's a gypsy . 
  romania is big as far as population is concerned and has a sizeable roma population . 
  it 's also poorer then other countries in the vicinity , so the roma are poorer as well . 
  so there is a high chance that that a roma somewhere in western europe is from romania rather than some other neighbouring country .
