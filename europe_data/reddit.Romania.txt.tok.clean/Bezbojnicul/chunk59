   if i was romanian , i would probably be furious that my nation is the dumping ground of unwanted gypsies . 
  nobody 's dumping roma here . 
  they 're just sending the ones with romanian citizenship back to their country . 
  nobody 's dumping bulgarian or kosovar or slovak roma in romania . 
  everything is about `` culture '' these days . 
  people do n't hate muslims and gypsies , they `` hate culture x '' and `` defend culture y '' . 
  `` not all cultures are equal '' is being repeated ad nauseam now . 
  xenophobia is unifying as well . 
  oh , poor you ... 
   elbrus is in europe it 's on the border , to be exact . 
  hence , some of the reactions .

  they all have [ the same etymology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gypsy_ ( term \\ ) #list _ of_names ) . 
  how loaded a word is can vary from language to language , and on context . 
   afaik romani is the correct english term . 
  it still varies , as it 's a recent term . 
   because it 's derogatory term . 
  at least in romanian it depends on context tbh . 
   i lived for 23 years near them , never heard them call one another something else other than a gypsy . 
  they called themselves '' \u0163igani '' , because i suspect you did n't live near anglophone gypsies . 
   but they still prefer gypsies . 
  no they do n't . 
   [ first romani congress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_romani_congress#first_world_romani_congress ) :  * usage of the word `` roma '' ( rather than variants of `` gypsy '' ) was also accepted by a majority of attendees ; as a result , the international gypsy committee ( founded in 1965 ) was renamed the komiteto lumniako romano ( international rom committee ) . 
  * +  plus , the article used `` romanis '' which is false . 
  the plural is `` romani '' . 
  then he used `` romanies '' ... 
  i mean , just decided already which one . 
  the english language has both `` roma '' and `` romany '' and `` romani '' , as well as the plurals `` romanis '' and `` romanies '' see [ oxford ] ( http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/romany?q=romani ) and [ merriam-webster ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/romani ) . 
   rroma is both singular and plural . 
  you can say `` he is a rroma '' or you can say `` that group of rroma is already there . '', 
  `` rroma '' is [ nowhere ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rroma ) to [ be found ] ( http://oxforddictionaries.com/spellcheck/english/?q=rroma ) in the english language . 
  ( it 's prefered in the romanian language though ) . 
  `` roma '' is the english version .

  are you a prophet ? 
   maybe it will come back . 
  probably will . 
   until the people of the us stop referring to europe as if it was one country with one culture tbh , i could n't care less if they refer to europe as if it were one country or not .

  i 've heard his accent is typical of philadelphia . 
  i find it interesting . 
  it feels a bit out of place , as it 's not exactly the kind of accent one would associate with a foreign pm . 
  you could start by looking around [ here ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:old_maps_of_europe ), 
  slavic influence starts in about the 7th century , when the slavic migration happened . 
  but \u201e ion '' , \u201e maria '' , \u201e mihai '' , \u201e gabriel '' etc. 
  are , and they are the most widespread . 
  the romans pulled out of dacia in the 3rd century ad . 
  from then on until the 13th century there was a sort of dark age , where waves upon waves of migrating barbarians passed through what is now romania and nobody knows exactly what went down . 
  what is known is that the [ first bulgarian tsardom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_bulgarian_empire ) extended its influence north of the danube somewhere around the 10th c. , and that is probably when the cyrilic alphabet got adopted round these parts . 
  slavonic also became the literary language around here ( like church latin in the west ) , so when the br\u0103ila boyars told the moldovan prince stephen the great to fuck himself via a letter , they did it in slavonic , even if both parties were probably romanian-speakers . 
   they have interesting names . 
  what do you mean . 
  i do n't think most are slavic tbh ( amd some slavic ones have gone out of style ) . 
  the usual biblical names dominate , i 'd say . 
  after roma , germans are the biggest minority in hungary iirc , and there are many hungarians with german family names ( like pal schmitt ) , most likely assimilated schwabians . 
  so you 're not far off . 
   it is a latin language so it means it switched to cyrillic at some point that point would be somewhere roughly between the 3rd and 13th centuries ad  then back to latin at some point ? 
  during the 1850s-60s . 
  we even had a cool transitional alphabet for a whhile , a mix of latin and cyrillic . 
   i think that 's the part where the hungarian and romanian histories differ . 
  there are many parts , not just this . 
   in hungarian history it 's not complicated at all , the whole area was part of hungary . 
  all histories learned in school are oversimplifications . 
  medieval states - with all the vassalages and so on - are complicated entities and judging them by the way today 's states are made up might be a bit misleading . 
  that was my point . 
  while i agree that mihai viteazu 's symbolic status is a modern creation , your whole rant , while informative , is kinda irrelevant to the discussion . 
  my point was that finishing highschool in romania means you know romanian . 
  you can not pass the bacalaureate exam if you do n't . 
   her brother learned romanian when he was 27 so i 'm guessing he never finished highschool . 
   romania as a state existed , it was called wallachia , and its sister state moldova that interpretation would be seen as a bit of a strech . 
  it might work if wallachia had annexed moldova , but stricto sensu , romania was formed by the union of two states . 
   transylvania was part of hungary , but never an integral part you can consider it an integral part between 1867 and 1918 , when it stopped having any kind of de jure status and just became part of the hungarian half of austri-hungary . 
  in medieval times , it was a bit more complicated . 
   there are hungarians in transylvania who do n't even speak romanian . 
  very few . 
  usually elderly rural people . 
   does anyone know if roma political parties have been formed in other countries besides the czech republic ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partida_romilor ) ( romania )  would you view it as a good or a bad thing to have organized roma political parties in your country ? 
  basically , is this an encouraging step in the right direction ? 
  in the long run yes . 
  although i would n't get my hopes up . 
   a cuman ( who are some kind of ~ ~ tatars ~ ~ ) they were turkic , like the tatars , but saying they are `` some kind of tatars '' is like saying portuguese are `` some kind of spaniards '' , 
   you need constant interaction to continue to communicate efficiently . 
  well yes , but the constant interaction they are lacking is the interaction in romanian with their parents . 
   ymmv que ? 
   many refuse to speak romanian at home in order to fit in at school . 
  this saddens me a lot :( not only can one grow up bilingual and integrate just fine , but knowing another language is useful in life , even if it 's `` just '' romanian . 
  there is a text in [ this pdf ] ( http://mek.niif.hu/06000/06046/06046.pdf ) called * `` the california of the romanians '' : the integration of northern dobrogea into romania , 1878-1913 * which seems quite interesting ( i have n't finished it yet , tbh ),
