   they rely on the state budget , and if they 'd have autonomy the state wo n't give them shit anymore . 
  not necessarily . 
  they could still get money , the thing they want is to have a higher degree of decision on how they manage that money . 
  i am insulted by the fact that eastern europe is left out . 
  i mean my children will probably be a minority as well . 
  why are we left out of this map ? 
  because we 're not `` western '' ? 
  because we 're not being overtaken by muslims ? 
  in 40 years the majority of eastern europe will have a [ roma gypsy majority ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45881000/jpg/_45881135_007456212-1.jpg ) , but you do n't care do you ? 
  to hell with the easterners , right ? 
  typical western arrogance !, 
  to keep in mind :  the document is clearly not a final version and subject to change . 
  the articles i linked to in [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/2ezxo2/eu_summit_to_choose_van_rompuys_and_ashtons/ ) might be of help . 
  it 's not about hate . 
  explanation [ here ] ( http://wheresmysammich.com/picture/63700/7-wonders-from-caracal/ ) . 
  romans and dacians . 
  romans because we speak a romance language , and [ dacians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacians ) because they lived round here , and were probably \u201e our ancestors '' genetically speaking . 
  it 's all fun and games until someone looses a province ... 
  vaslui * county * is the butt of jokes , but as a city , caracal is king . 
  found [ another map ] ( http://lohvitsa.org.ua/_fr/3/5218938.jpg ) via google . 
  serpent 's wall sections are numbers 5 to 11 . 
  oh , that is very true . 
  part of [ this photoessay ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/08/nato-russian-soldiers-are-now-in-ukraine/100800/ ) . 
  i have a feeling the pro-russia-ness of orban is exagerated a bit . 
   they are massively over-represented in the parliament . 
  `` massively '' ? 
  the are a bit over-represented because of voter-redistribution and higher discipline of the electorate , but that just means that instead of 6 % they have maybe 7-8 % of mps . 
  remembered another : not a noun , but an adjective : '' [ \u0163ais ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/%c8%9bais/541719 ) '' from [ zeiss ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_zeiss_ag ) , meaning of great quality/precision . 
   `` general purpose vehicle '' yep . 
  a `` g.p. 
  vehicle '' , 
   palatschinken is also a german word it 's [ romanian ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palatschinke ) . 
  it entered german from hungarian actually . 
   are you sure it was borrowed from romanian ? 
  i 'm not sure , but in romania it 's used a lot , and i think it survived because romanian also uses `` frigider '' for fridge . 
  even if it did n't enter via romanian ( it 's very possible it entered via german ) , it survived in transilvania because of it . 
  here it 's [ finetti ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wlzdptxf34w/tfa3umv-y8i/aaaaaaaaalw/t0zqyzf67a0/s1600/img_4925+%2528large%2529.jpg ) , which is a local brand . 
  every chocolate/nougat cream that is not nutella is called finetti . 
   ** flex ** for angle grinders  ** plexiglas ** for poly ( methyl 2-methylpropenoate ) ,  ** rigips ** for drywall  ** tetrapak ** for plastic coated paper carton food containers . 
  yes , 
  \u201e palacsinta '' is the most obvious ( borrowed by many others as well ) . 
  in general we lent words that have to do with shepherding to our neighbours . 
  on the other hand , regional varieties of hungarian are full of romanian loan-words ( especially in szeklerland ) . 
  for example , in some areas , the local name for that most hungarian of vegetables , the pepper , is called \u201e argyej '' , because it came via wallachia . 
  a lot of standard hungarian names for vegetables are alien to me , as i use the romanianized version . 
  the most interesting etymological journey imo is \u201e vin\u00e9tta '' , which means eggplant in transylvanian hungarian , but has come to mean \u201e eggplant salad '' in standard hungarian ( where eggplant salad was brought recently by transylvanian hungarians who called it \u201e vin\u00e9tta sal\u00e1ta '' ) . 
  the standard hungarian word for eggplant is \u201e padlizs\u00e1n '' , which comes from turkish and is cognate with the romanian \u201e p\u0103tl\u0103gea '' ( \u201e v\u00een\u0103t\u0103 '' itself is a contraction from \u201e p\u0103tl\u0103gea v\u00e2n\u0103t\u0103 '' ) . 
  \u201e fridzsider '' also entered coloquial hungarian in transilvania , via romanian , or maybe it entered from french but survived because of romanian . 
  used in romanian too . 
  pronounced either \u201e f\u00f6n '' or \u201e fion '' ( there is no \u00d6 in romanian ) . 
  [ dero ] ( http://www.i-comert.ro/files/product/original/dero-surf-automat-detergent-221.jpg ) - for detergent ( which is an abbreviation for `` detergent rom\u00e2nesc '' - romanian detergent ) ^ ^ til [ helas ] ( http://www.elcasio.ro/helas.jpg ) - [ lemon juice substitute ] ( http://www.lemondressing.gr/english/html/home.htm ) ps in hungarian * [ eternit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternit ) * - [ asbestos fibre cement ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/wellasbestdach-233-3354_img.jpg/800px-wellasbestdach-233-3354_img.jpg ) hard disk drive is \u201e winchester '' afaik , after a the [ ibm3340 hard disk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_ibm_magnetic_disk_drives#ibm_3340 ) . 
  yeah . 
  it means \u201e friendship '' , 
  because communists created forced cooperative farms , the people really wanted their land back , so it got fragmented into a lot of little plots . 
  add to that the fact that the rural areas are aging , the land is underworked , as most agriculture is subsitence . 
  but that is slowly changing , due to eu subsidies . 
  do n't worry , we 're working on upgrading our agricultural capabilities . 
  ^ ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ ^ eu, 
   i think if you have a dinner and reach a consensus at that dinner what if they go to the office afterwards and have a show of hands afterwards , so it 's clear to everyone that they have a consensus . 
  there has to be a moment when they establish that the consensus exists . 
  a moment when they count the \u201e aye '' s and \u201e nay '' s to establish that they do , in fact , have a consensus . 
  can that moment count as a vote ? 
  well then , what constitutes a vote . 
  does a \u201e who 's in favor ? '' followed by a raising of hands constitute a vote ? 
  i think you 're really wasting too much energy debating the exact word used here . 
  but if in an election all the electors vote the same way , it 's still an election , is it not ? 
  i guess so . 
  all the members agreed on him . 
  i 'm not sure on the exact protocol , but if they could n't reach a consensus it could have been decided by qualified majority vote , like juncker was . 
  see discussion here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2f0ppr/donald_tusk_has_just_been_elected_as_the_next/, 
  because mogherini is a comissioner , and still has to go through the whole ep grilling process , just like all the other comissioners , and only after that does she get the job . 
  tusk on the other hand just got the job . 
  he only needed the council to elect him . 
  ( i think ) . 
  her french is tip top as well , i see . 
  bbc : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28989875 conference : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/ebs/live.cfm?page=1&amp;sitelang=en, 
  do n't forget to crosspost to / r/europics, 
  yeah , me 3 . 
  or at the very least not mogherini . 
  no , and tusk 's nomination ( center-right , eastern european , man ) would mean that mogherini 's chances got extremely good ( center-left , western european , female ) , unfortunately . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ez9ce/a_fivepoint_guide_to_the_eu_top_jobs_puzzle/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ez9av/european_council_preview_who_will_get_the_eus/ ) to get a feeling of how this whole negotiation algorithm works . 
  i 'm still hoping for a thorning-schmit + georgieva combo ( best in my opinion ) , given that sikorski is probably too hawkish to be acceptable . 
  great post , but yer venn diagrams are n't working ... 
  the cia ? 
  find one that is willing to learn hungarian , 
  interesting . 
  how is this phenomenon viewed ? 
   how common is interracial dating in your country ? 
  if we exclude roma-white dating , which is very common , but which might not be viewed as `` interracial in the traditional sense '' , it 's rare . 
  the most common one after that , which has a long history , is between foreign male students , arab mostly , and some african , and romanian women . 
  the most famous such mixed child is [ cabral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabral_ibacka ) , tv host and blogger . 
  another one is [ nadine ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i26vcbbrrhu/t704qbzibxi/aaaaaaaaapa/mgiiqzlo-eu/s1600/biografie+nadine+vedete+blog.jpg ) , also in showbiz . 
  there are some mixed race kids in my hometown ( hungarian/black and romanian/asian ) and i know of a some friends-of-friends who are centrafrican/romanian , syrianarab/romanian and korean/romanian mix . 
  also , i had a friend whose sister was maried to a syrian dude . 
  while arab/romanian marriages are the most widespread , and not really that shocking , i do n't think `` interracial marriages '' are that widespread in the grand scheme of things . 
  note : jews are not considered a different race , as in the us , they are seen as white . 
   do any of you have a partner of a different race ? 
  not me personally . 
   just like in georgia ? 
  georgia was n't in nato , we are .
