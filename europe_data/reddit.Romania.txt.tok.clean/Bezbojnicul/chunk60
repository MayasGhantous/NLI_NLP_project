  it does n't have one on a federal level . 
  but about half of the states that make up the us do have one or more official languages . 
  in the case of california , the only official language is english . 
  interesting . 
  weird it was ignored . 
  i would n't vote for fidesz . 
  i feel no gratitude for the opportunity to quickly get hungarian citizenship , as it is far outweighed by the fact that since fidesz is in power , hungary 's international prestige has gone down the drain , and its relationship with romania is way more chilly then it used to be . 
  in the mszp days you really felt more warmth in the bilateral relations . 
  so yeah , if i will have citizenship by the time of the elections , i will definitely not vote fidesz . 
  i also think , just for the record , that emigrants should have more voting right than ethnic hungarians from the neighbouring countries ( who might have little contact with hungarian politics ) . 
  also , a lot of people get hungarian citizenship for more pragmatic reasons than `` back in the hungarian family '' yaddy-yadda . 
  many tatars and turks in dobrogea do not appear on the map because : 1 . 
  after dobrogea was awarded to romania ( 1878 ) a significant number of tatars emigrated to turkey 2 . 
  romania pursued a policy of settlement of romanians and aromanians in the region . 
  when we got the region , it was only 1/5 romanian . 
  you can see - in [ the demographic stats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobrogea#northern_dobruja ) - a sharp drop in the number of turks and tatars in the 1878-1880 period ( right after it was given to romania ) and a significant rise in romanians in the 1880-1899 period . 
  sure . 
  will do in a day or two . 
  it must be crazy season . 
  '' [ dacomaniacs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ) '' [ just had their congress ] ( http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/dacologii-sustin-la-buzau-ca-romanii-sunt-cel-mai-vechi-popor-1052918.html ) 2 weeks ago . 
  guess who the oldest people in europe are ? 
  dacians , of course !, 
   most our immigrants there are not even economical , they are there for ideological differences . 
  you think your average racist cares about these differences ? 
  you 're a brown muslim from the middle east , ergo , you 're bad . 
   i mean , i understand turks -- and we hate afghans , pakis and arabs ourselves . 
  but ffs , us ? 
  lol !, 
  ... that does n't involve going to war with germany . 
  you need an educated elite to start a country an keep it roling . 
  think of the generally high level of education of the european jewish population . 
  now think of the generally low level of education and lack of an educated elite . 
  you ca n't have a country like that without some sense of nationhood , and you ca n't have a sense of nationhood without a minimum level of education . 
  roma are highly dispersed , highly fragmented linguistically ( romany is highly dialectified and many roma speak the language of the host nation ) , highly fragmented into `` cast '' or `` clan '' levels ( traditional kalderash roma do not mary `` lower '' kinds of roma , for example ) and have a weak sense of nationhood ( there is a sense of roma vs non-roma , but far from what we call a `` national consciousness '' ) . 
  creating a country with this population is basically creating a kind of zair or haiti . 
  come on . 
  it 's the most original comment in this whole fuckin thread  ), 
   they may come from romania they come from a lot of eastern european countries . 
  we just have the biggest slice of the pie . 
   try to be constructive about thing that manages to enrage so many people to be fair , there is little constructive criticism in this thread , and a lot of finger-pointing and self-congratulatory prancing around . 
  so are the overwhelming majority of roma in romania . 
  gypsy started out , and it 's still used predominantly as an ethnic name . 
  the fact that it spread to non-roma nomads is true , but it does not negate it 's use as an ethnic exonym . 
   here 's a clip from george carlin about pride oh spare me . 
  this was not about ethnic pride int the `` white pride world wide '' sense . 
  it was about not being ashamed . 
   if i was a roma and wanted to integrate myself with the romanian culture i would n't want to associate myself with the roma culture either . 
  it is widely believed , and for good reasons , that most roma break the law and beg on the streets . 
  now , would n't it be wise to disassociate yourself to this kind of culture in general ? 
  the same way it 's wise to disassociate yourself from being romanian while abroad . 
  you would n't want to be associated with one of the most backward countries in europe , now would you ? 
  do you think shame of `` your randomness '' is logical , btw ? 
   i am fairly certain that the more educated of them do not care about such triviality . 
  i really do n't care how certain you are of things with absolutely zero evidence . 
  not all of them have to be intelectuals , just your average working-class person . 
  the fact remains that there are , according to estimates , somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5 milion romanian citizens are roma . 
  fact remains that only 0.6 milion declare their ethnicity as roma , others choosing to declare something else . 
   i still would n't consider this of them trying to `` pass off as romanian '' but rather to disassociate themselves of being from a mostly toxic culture . 
  the two are not mutually exclusive . 
   it 's due to the vast majority of ` visible ' romanians in western europe being gypsies . 
  same as how the most visible gypsies are the stereotypical ones . 
   til not begging on the street , breaking the law and being an asshole to the general public is trying very hard to pass off as romanian . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  how many of the integrated roma stand proudly by their ethnicity , and how many shy away from mentioning it to the point of saying they are `` romanian '' ? 
  there is a reason twice as many roma ( according to estimates ) declare themselves romanian at the census as there are those who declare themselves roma . 
   there are two ( geographically separated ) groups of roma , one is well integrated and while they keep their identity they do n't cause any problems and the other one lives in tents or villages that look like third world slums could you expand on this a bit please ? 
   probably because most non-gypsy romanians are virtually indistinguishable from italians kinda like non-stereotypical gypsies are virtually indistinguishable from romanians . 
   most romanians have nothing against integrated roma people . 
  to some degree , that 's because integrated roma try very hard to pass off as romanian or , in some cases , hungarian . 
  i think you missreading this . 
  yes . 
  about half of them speak romany ( gypsy ) as their mother tongue , and the other half speak romanian , or to a very small degree , hungarian , as their mother tongue . 
  but either way , the overwhelming majority , if not all of them , understand romanian . 
  * ps * for those interested , [ here ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ ) are the census results : ** mother tongue ** : romany - 247.058 out of those with romany as a mother tongue , 244.503 identify as roma , 897 as romanian , 207 as hungarian , and the rest as some other ethnicity . 
  ** ethnicity ** : roma - 621.573 out of those who self-identify as roma , 342.674 consider romanian their mother tongue , 244.503 consider romany their mother tongue , 32.777 hungarian and the rest some other language . 
  i have linked the article featuring the 19 % number in a different comment . 
   but if in those 19 % are most of the thieves , beggars and all around bad people than i think the point stands . 
  this might very well be , but it 's a bit difficult to tell , given that the other type of roma also emigrated to some degree . 
  results : * rate of emigration : 19 % for both roma and non-roma ( households with members in another country ) rate of internal migration : 5 % for roma , 7.7 % for non-roma ( households with members in a different place , but inside romania ) reasons for emigration : ** roma ** * 40.1 % - poverty * 38.3 % - `` for a better life '' * 19.8 % - lack of a job ** non-roma ** * 42.5 % - lack of a job * 39.2 % - `` for a better life '' * 12.4 % - poverty immigrants mostly come from a lower income bracket ( under 700lei/mo . 
  - roughly 157 euro ) , mostly from the cities , neighbourhoods inside the city ( as opposed to the periphery ) and from households with a larger than average number of people . 
  also , 80 % of roma emmigrants come from ethnically mixed neighbourhoods , and only 16.4 % from compact monoethnic roma communities . 
   i 'm partly glad that many of them are not our problem anymore they ( roma from romania ) are still mostly `` our problem '' because : 1 . 
  they are still citizens of our country 2 . 
  most of them are still in romania ( emigration rates are at 19 % for both roma and non-roma ) . 
   we were accused countless times that we were racists and refuse to integrate them in our society , but now the same countries are looking confused at this problem and have no solution for it this issue is a bit more complex than `` if they are to blame it means we are innocent '' . 
  that is indeed , a fair point . 
  i do n't think they are . 
  they are n't saying `` dressing up as women is bad '' . 
  they 're saying `` we 'll dress you up as a woman because it annoys you ( you idiot ) '' . 
   never understood why people try to shame sexist/homophobes ... by dressing them as women . 
  an unfortunate implication there guys . 
  because it annoys the homophobes , by attacking their masculinity ( well , their image of it at least ) . 
  problem is , that would complicate things for russia in a negative way ( from an international pov they would be annexing another states - georgia 's - territory ) . 
  their interest is a nominally independent south ossetia . 
   but it surprises me that there is actually tourism in abchazia . 
  sukhumi ( abkhazia ) , batumi ( georgia ) and sochi ( russia ) were popular tourist destinations in soviet times . 
  i 'm guessing somewhat open borders and the reputation of soviet times brought some of the russians back for a visit . 
  are you gon na do this with every existing country ? 
  you can easily extrapolate my position on kurdish in turkey solely from the information i provided in this thread . 
  i think macedonia 's law is quite ok , but i do n't see how your comment relates to my comment .
