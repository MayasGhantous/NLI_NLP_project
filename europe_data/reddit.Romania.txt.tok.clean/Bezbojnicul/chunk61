  also , you 'll notice i already stated in a different comment that i * do n't * think minority languages need to be co-official on a national level . 
  this is not about outbidding russia , but becoming a support for moldova when russia decides to stop shipment to moldova to force its hand . 
  someone raised the same issue in the discution over at / r/linguistics which i linked below . 
  i kinda regret not linking directly to that thread tbh . 
  germany was n't formed in 1990 . 
  germany , in its full name federal republic of germany exists in its curent constitutional form since 1949 . 
  contrary to talks about `` unification '' , 1990 was not a moment when 2 states merged to form a new one , but when the federal republic of germany extended it 's control over territories held by ddr , as per [ article 23 of its constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grundgesetz#extensions_of_the_field_of_application_by_article_23 ) . 
  unless the official language is something spoken natively by no-one , there is no equality . 
  how big was the turkish minority of germany from the 1870s ? 
  yes , given the fact that unlike immigrants , they did not choose to move to the new country , but the new country formed around them . 
  ( i do n't think that any minority language should be a '' * nationwide * official language '' , as with the case of swedish in finland , only locally , where it is used ), 
  ask yourself this : did turks exist in what is now now germany when the country was created ? 
  germany 's turks are immigrants , not a historical minority , like swedish-speaking finns . 
  ( i do n't dissagree with your second line though . ), 
  some valuable nuance : http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1l6l0t/finnish_nationalists_want_to_end_compulsory/, 
  do n't hold your breath , 
  upper-right white dot . 
  also : [ after a six-year gap , romania 's public television is to resume broadcasts to moldova ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-s-tvr-to-restart-broadcasts-to-moldova ), 
  we just put it down to `` victims of soviet propaganda '' , so we can continue to feel better, 
   [ kosovo 's ] industry-sized diaspora machine working for them . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_kosovo  remittances from the kosovo diaspora accounted for an estimated 14 percent of gdp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_moldova  remittances from moldovans abroad account for almost 38 % of moldova 's gdp , the second-highest percentage in the world . 
  or , you know , maybe the words are related . 
   he romanian far right , through the decade or two of its success , was about distrust of hungarians and jews ; etc. 
  more about gypsies than jews . 
  not many jews still around ( although antisemitism is still present latently ), 
   note : the chart shows changes in percentage vote shares for far-right parties from the last national election held before 2008 to the most recent national election ( as of august 2013 ) . 
  problem is that in the case of romania , it makes it seem like the crisis led to a decline in far-right support . 
  actually , the far-right greater romania party was kicked out of parliament in the 2008 elections , before the crisis , and never returned . 
  so the crisis simply did not affect far-right membership of paliament , instead of affecting it in a good way , as the chart seems to indicate . 
  how so ? 
  how do the general public in poland feel about the german minority voting in the german elections ? 
   massive amounts of them were gathered round from all over the local and distant europe and dumped in the country source for this please ? 
  coincidentally , batman is the name of a city in turkey , a muslim country . 
  not implying anything , just making an observation . 
  his one rich bastard !, 
  can you not read ? 
  my pleasure !, 
  it was intended to read :  * [ moldova 's ] * capital * [ is ] * chisinau , * [ and it ( moldova ) ] * has t * w * o `` autonomous regions '' . 
  edited the post for clarity . 
   us 's modus operandi of creating a terrorist organization huh ? 
   if we were really against chemical weapons , we would n't have used them in iraq . 
  what do you mean ? 
  looked around [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauz_people#language ) :  the modern gagauz language has two dialects : central ( or `` bulgar '' ) and southern ( or maritime ) i think it just means `` bulgar-influenced dialect '' not `` spoken by bulgarians '' , as the [ bulgarian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bessarabia_bulgarians ) and gagauz areas of bessarabia are quite close and intermingled . 
  they had a strong unionist vibe in moldova in the early 90s . 
  our ruling elites ... not so much . 
   they have a bulgarian minority that actually struggled for autonomy there recently . 
  they speak a gagauz language and they have bulgarian schools there . 
  the bulgarians speak gagauz ? 
   but if you ask any romanian they 'll say yes , let 's unite , they 'll say `` let 's unite !, 
  ... but not right now . '', 
  in case the link do n't work : [ try here ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=dacia+leads+charge+of+emerging+market+cars+in+europe&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=rcs#channel=rcs&amp;fp=d5f90a007cdb12fd&amp;q=dacia+leads+charge+of+emerging+market+cars+in+europe&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;tbm=nws ), 
   moldova split off from romania under communist rule during the soviet era and remained independent since . 
  it split off with some help from the red army  so here we go : * eastern half of the historical region of moldavia * we call them bessarabians , because the name `` moldovan can refer to both our moldovans ( eastern romanians ) or to citizens of moldova . 
  * romanian ( moldovan ) majority , ukrainian + russian minority * young romanians are pro-union , elders and minorities are pro-russia * politics is split between the communist party ( not very communist , but quite anti-romanian ) and the `` pro-european '' parties , which are from neutral to very pro-romanian . 
  * they can easily get romanian citizenship . 
  * its capital is chisinau , and it has two `` autonomous regions '' . 
  one is peaceful , g\u0103g\u0103uzia , home to a cristian turkic minority ( they have the right to secede in case moldovans decide to reunite with romania ) . 
  the other is a `` breakaway republic '' , transnistria , the land that time forgot , dominated by the russians there . 
  the 14th russian army has a `` peacekeeping mission '' there , and the place looks like it 's still in the ussr ( lenin statues , hammer and sickle on flag , parliament is called `` supreme soviet '' ) * poor * the regional dialect has a lot of russian words and a lot of words that have fallen out of use in romania , so it has an archaic feel sometimes . 
  * calling the language `` moldovan '' is very political . 
  you will find a lot of romanians insisting it 's romanian and should be called that . 
  ( there were soviet attempts to create a `` moldovan ethnic identity '' and it reached ridiculous levels when they started insisting that `` moldovan '' is an entirely different language , to the point of having a romanian-moldovan dictionary ) * flag and coa modeled on the romanian ones * nicknamed `` our brothers from across the prut '' * the orthodox are split between the `` moldovan orthodox church '' - subordonate tot he moscow patriarchy and the `` bessarabian orthodox church '' subordonate to the romanian patriarchy, 
   spain could be carnations .

   ro : centru gr : anatoliki makedonia , thraki these are two regions , 
   the treatment of armenian minorities . 
  i think you mean `` albanian minorities '' . 
  as / u/grishnakur notes , lithuanian has retained many features of proto-indo-european that have been lost in other indo-european languages see [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_language#history ) or ask around / r/linguistics for more details ( i 'm not a linguist , so my knowledge is somewhat limited on the details ), 
   are we still doing those topics ? 
  these topics have traditionally taken place on sunday here on / r/europe, 
  my pleasure , 
  imagine your grandpa has a lot of grandchildren , and there is one that looks very close to how he looked in his youth , while others look somewhat like grandpa , but not extremely , and others look totally different because they are black or asian or whatever on the other side of their family . 
  now all these grandchildren are equally distantly related to gramps , but not all of them look like gramps . 
   their language is considered to ** be the closest living relative of the original indo-european language ** as it has retained many features of it that have been lost in other indo-european languages . 
  it 's considered * the most conservative * of the indo-european languages . 
  all languages ar equally close to in time to proto-indo-european .

   this article is typical ivory tower morality talk pretty much . 
  it 's tiresome how one-sided some people tend to be . 
   they honestly fight against sending their children to good schools . 
  who does that ? 
  evangelical americans for example ... 
   and this does n't at least give you a hint that maybe fucking tens of millions of people around europe might be in on something ? 
  there 's another expression in romanian `` being a kike '' ( `` a fi jidan '' ) meaning ` to be an extreme cheapskate ' . 
  there is also the english verb '' [ to jew ( down ) ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jew ) '' meaning :  1 . 
  to bargain shrewdly or unfairly with . 
  to haggle so as to reduce ( a price ) . 
  i 'm sure other nations have expressions regarding stereotypical behavior of jews as well . 
   ataturk was born in greece . 
  and there are a lot of theories ( conspiratorial afaik ) about how ataturk was not turkish but actually some other balkan ethnicity, 
   to be fair , is there anyone who actually lives near gypsies who does n't dislike them ? 
  [ ... ] unless you actually meet gypsies on a daily basis , it 's just empty talk . 
  my grandparents live in a mixed community ( gypsies arent immediate neighbours , but they are not far of ) . 
  they do n't dislike gypsies .
