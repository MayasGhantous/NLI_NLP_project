  they do n't shy away from throwing stereotypes around , but there is no blanket dislike for gypsies . 
  hell , they even lived in a room rented from gypsies when they first moved to the city , and my grandpa has hired gypsies as day labourers when he needed the extra pair of hand without giving it a second thought . 
  as an architect , he also regularly designed houses for gypsies ( no , not the flabuoyant kind , but regular houses ) and contrary to what you might expect , he did n't get screwed over . 
  also i have a coworker who lives in what is essentially the gypsy neighbourhood of my hometown . 
  when asked , he said he lived there all his life never had any trouble with them . 
  when asked , 50 % of romanians said they would n't mind having a gypsy neighbour . 
  and romanians see gypsies on a daily basis . 
   not going to be convinced otherwise either . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
   not everyone who serves in the army is a knight in shining armor . 
  but that does n't mean that everyone in the soviet army was a monster just because of the actions of those that were . 
  while i might agree with you to an extent , you can not expect others to understand your outrage at this `` defacement '' , when you do n't seem to understand other people 's outrage at the soviet army . 
   we should have just left you guys with the nazis if you didnt want cases of rape and pillage from battle worn soldiers . 
  now you 're just being douchey . 
  also , from the point of view of many in eastern europe , you , as a state , lost the moral high-ground early in the war , when you signed a deal with the devil to carve up europe . 
  be that as it may , it still negates his point that all responsibility lies in moscow . 
  my parents would n't return to communism period . 
  sure , they agree , the 60s and 70s were n't as bad as the 80s , but they still would n't want it . 
   we as in romanians ? 
  yes . 
   it considered romanian democracy a subject of `` scientific interest '' last year which article ( s ) are you referring to ? 
   do some research-see the gdp and debt of bulgaria before 1989 and after . 
  you should look into this : http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+of+bulgaria+1980-2011 also , some data on [ gdp ( ppp ) in the 1999-2011 period ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=bu&amp;v=67 ) . 
  i wonder wath the maximum was during the commie days . 
   before 1989 , apart from some freedoms missing , the country was doing better and the people were living better . 
  my parents would rather die 10 times over instead of returning to the romania of the '80s . 
  to a lot of people those `` some freedoms '' are well worth the hardships of post-communism . 
   second we did what moscow told us to do . 
  we did n't . 
  we do . 
   b ) those moderates who fight assad in syria need help , not extremists . 
  and our reluctance in the matter has only strengthened the likes of al-nusra at the expense of the more secular fsa . 
  sorry to dissapoint , but i 'll be vacationing soon . 
  you probably wo n't be seing any more maps till later in september . 
  but i 'll have some cool stuff then . 
  beautiful freakin article !, 
  what a pleasure to read !, 
  something like this regarding all the eu members would be very-very interesting . 
  true that . 
  maybe a us vs. eu would have been a better comparison . 
  in what way ? 
  otoh , another one of rosenthal 's personifications of romania , '' [ revolutionary romania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/revolutionary_romania_by_c_d_rosenthal.jpg ) '' , features maria rosetti ( born mary grant , of british origin ), 
  nope . 
  [ hungarian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bela_lugosi ) . 
  ah , cool . 
  i 'll look into it . 
  thanks, 
  ( un ) favorable views towards homosexuality , importance of religion ( in poland and romania ) , morality and belief in god , maybe more emphasis on freedom versus statism ( last one is speculation ) . 
   how can someone see these stats and claim that europe were too different to be united ? 
  i 'd like to see these stats for all eu countries tbh . 
  i 'd wager some things might be a bit different in eastern europe . 
  there is a very interesting documentary about it called `` into eternity '', 
   or is it bad only when ussr is doing it ? 
  nope . 
  it 's bad no matter who does it . 
   they 're probably less religous considering the soviet clampdown on religous institues yes , they are quite secular , afaik . 
  also , the ones in azerbaidjan use latin script , those in iran , the arabic script . 
  also the ex-ussr azeris all have russianised names ( ilham ali ** ev ** ) . 
  bonus fact : the current supreme leader of iran , ali khamenei , is half azerbaijani . 
  could you elaborate in the last point ? 
  what did they say exactly ? 
  sounds interesting ...

   any non-brown gypsy is definatly a mix with some person . 
  actually , the lighter skinned gypsies i was talking about are mostly found among the transylvanian gabor gypsies . 
  they are definitely not mixed with non-roma . 
  they are very traditional and almost never mix with even with other kinds of roma , let alone gadje .

  your wish ist mein command . 
  enjoy !, 
   yes all of them are brown . 
  lol . 
  i 've even seen fair-skinned gypsies . 
  hell , i 've seen ginger gypsies a couple of times . 
  not all are brown . 
   i have a hard time imagining any european getting married to a gypsy . 
  there are tons of half-roma in europe . 
  just one example of mixed marriage [ here ] ( http://assets.sport.ro/assets/protv/2013/05/31/image_galleries/32991/banel-nicolita-se-insoara-astazi-cum-arata-aleasa-inimii-luni-cristina.png ) . 
  i think you a word . 
   crazy number when roma are about 2-3 % of total population . 
  not that crazy when you take into consideration they are mostly at the bottom of the social pyramid . 
  from the same wikiarticle you cite below ( google-translated ) :  roma in the czech republic are among the groups that are most affected by social exclusion , with all the negative consequences of this phenomenon , namely , low educational attainment , 30 % of roma children end estimates activists in practical schools , [ 21 ] and subsequent high unemployment and frequent crime . 
  [ 22 ] and yes , roma are overrepresented in romanian prisons as well . 
  and probably in the neighbouring countries as well . 
  you are now subscribed to * sanmarinofacts * !,

   `` transylvania was taken away from hungary and given to romania , and 100 years later people in hungary have not giving that back , '' what the grammer ? 
   and who did it belong to before hungary invading it ? 
  that 's right . 
  romania . 
  there was no `` romania '' before 1859 . 
   if the hungarians can make a legitimate claim how transylvania is theirs because attila the hun invaded 1000 years ago , then by that logic romania can also make a legitimate claim on half of present-day hungary , as it was part of the dacian kingdom before the huns invaded . 
  both claims are equally stupid . 
   and that majority is , * and always was * , romanian . 
  there is insufficient evidence to say for sure that `` it always was '' . 
  regardless , it does n't really matter what the ethnic composition of transylvania was in the 12th century . 
   clay [ ... ] clay [ ... ] clay you need to take a break from r/polandball,

  slightly different .
