  i see you do n't recognize kosovo ... 
  [ way back in the day ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/lion_distribution.png ), 
   i remember hearing anecdotes saying that slovak and slovene embassies sometimes receive mail packages that were meant for the other . 
  i 've heard of mail destined for moldova which took a detour through the maldives   trivia : very interesting ... and complicated . 
  prekmurje region has some hungarians . 
  most western/developed region of former yugoslavia . 
  basically the most austrian/least balkan region of ex-yugo . 
  small , mountainous , economically developed . 
  they have a small diaspora in austria and italy . 
  check out hungarian : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_language#lexicon romanian has a boatload as well : [ graph ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/cuvintelelimbiiromane.svg/474px-cuvintelelimbiiromane.svg.png ) ^ ro, 
  communists !, 
  actually , it 's the western countries that do n't know how to handle them and just deport them . 
  romania is used to gypsies , and i can say there is a somewhat functional modus vivendi between majority and minority . 
  but the west . 
  they freak the fuck out when they see them . 
  not all are poor . 
  just most of them . 
  probably true . 
   does romania have the highest concentration of gypsies in europe ? 
  no , i think bulgaria has a higher percentage when taking official figures . 
  ( ro : 3.3 % , bg : 4.6 % , but estimates place percentages higher , and slovakia might have a higher percentage than romania iirc ) , but romania is the largest country in the area , so in terms of actual numbers , we have the biggest number of them . 
  at least you 're not greenland ... 
   that 's ludicrous , people wanting to leave because the mods are n't censoring the reddit . 
  `` either delete the posts i do n't like or i 'll be offended and leave on my own '' , what an absolute joke . 
  the only ludicrous thing is how you ignore evidence . 
  i 've linked to the `` why this subreddit is needed '' thread above , where it 's exactly what users are saying . 
  look , i 'll quote it for you :  why this subreddit is needed . 
   ** if for no other reason , then it 's to escape situations like in this thread where a known racist brings friends in to downvote anything not fitting the agenda : ** [ link to a / r/europe thread ] then the top comment in that thread :  ** yes , that 's a problem . 
  ** if you 're bored , you could significantly affect the tone of a subreddit on your own , with a couple of buddies it becomes a piece of cake . 
  you do n't need many accounts to upvote a headline , and manipulating the comment section is just as easy . 
  you can actually observe how the karma of those posts comes and goes in waves . 
  apart from ballot-stuffing , the two key concepts behind how this works and how it 's effective are astro-turfing and agenda-setting . 
  comprende ? 
   there was always a guy or two saying racist stuff , people always downvoted and moved on this was n't `` a guy or two '' . 
  well , you want a hamburg flair then ? 
  you 've missed the point of my comment entirely . 
   by contrast , r/portugal is completely unmoderated , [ ... ] , and it works perfectly / r/romania is unmoderated as well . 
  guess what ? 
  the quality is worse than / r/europe  it 's what kept this subreddit healthy back in the day it 's also what led to the exodus of the people willing to engage in awesome debates . 
  a point you choose to ignore . 
   the ones deluding themselves are those that think this subreddit is better now nobody thinks it 's better now than before the racist invasion ( an episode which you seem to be ignoring ) . 
   if you think this is good , you should have seen how awesome it was back in the day , back when the mods were n't fascists banning people for having controversial views . 
  --  the discussions we used to have were killed by their `` moderating '' . 
  you know what happened to all those awesome people from 2011 ? 
  they left and they started a new subreddit . 
  they did n't leave because of `` fascist moderation '' . 
  they left because of rampant racism and because they felt their well thought out comments were drowned out by stupid xenophobes and trolls . 
  so they went out and set up / r/europeans , which is an even more heavily moderated subreddit . 
  you 'll recognise a lot of names in their \u201e [ why this subreddit is needed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/1b1x6f/why_this_subreddit_is_needed/ ) '' - thread . 
  also , you might wan na check out the names in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/1at2qr/brainstorming_about_the_guidelines/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/1bdq4m/draft_guidelines_next_steps/ ) thread . 
  i 'd love to see all those people back on / r/europe . 
  but if you think less moderation will do the trick , you 're clearly deluding yourself . 
  you can ask them there yourself . 
  they will stay optional , do n't worry . 
  there is no point in forcing users to take up flairs if they do n't want to . 
  i 'm no estonian but [ wikipedia tells me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) that things were n't so clear cut . 
  it 's probably more then 0 % but less then 0.5 % so it got rounded to 0 . 
  yeah , i 'm not a fan of multiple flairs either ... 
   http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kenk0/map_recycling_rates_across_europe_oc/, 
  bigger version : http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/what/public-events/competitions/waste-smart-competition/recycling-rates-in-europe, 
  granted . 
  you might want to change the text of the flair now , 
  [ psa ] 1 . 
  flairs are ** not ** mandatory , but i 'm with / u/taenk in that i 'd like to see as many as possible . 
  remember , you can edit the text that accompanies your flair !, 
  some people have asked about multiple flairs . 
  we are currently discussing it between mods . 
  super-duper catalan independists now have the estelada available . 
  anarchy available as well , for all ye , with no masters . 
  this has been a psa , brought to you by the commissariat for flairs, 
  as you are not the first one to ask , the issue is currently under discussion between mods . 
   red was certainly the color of moldavia . 
   wallachian flag had big changes from a ruler to the other . 
  still , the most used color was a pale yellow . 
   transylvania was part of hungarian kingdom and later , of austrian and austro-hungarian empires . 
  there was no place for a romanian flag there . 
  but romanian noblemen living in transylvania had all , with no exception , the light blue color on their heralds . 
  sounds a bit like an explanation invented way after the adoption of the flag . 
  the part about `` romanian noblemen in transylvania '' ( what noblemen ? ), 
  sounds like bullshit tbh , plus the fact that the colors were adopted way before transylvania united with the regat . 
  there was a similar myth that it 's the merger of the wallachian and moldavian colors : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_flags_of_romania#merger_legend, 
  also capitalism is caused by the jews too . 
  for those interested , wikipedia has quite good articles : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_romania http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_flags_of_romania, 
   western governments , ** jewish media ** and human rights acitivists & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  the only thing is that muslims have less variation when it comes to naming their sons ( or at least mohamed is disproportionately popular ) . 
  that might give daily mail readers a jolt of paranoia when packaged as above , but in the end it 's not very meaningful . 
   no turks live in the republic of cyprus . 
  irrelevant . 
  roc claims the whole island . 
  i really hope you do n't actually think that the border between asia and europe runs through ledra street . 
   armenia was isolated from the rest if christian world . 
  yeah , no . 
   they have culturally more in common with turks , kurds and iranians than with europeans . 
  so do the balkans . 
  cyprus is just another asian country because turks live there . 
   with its own church just because they are myaphisites instead of regular orthodox does not magically transform them into asians . 
   a separate culture . 
  this is so fucking abitrary . 
  georaphically speaking . 
  and by the same measure , neither is cyprus .
