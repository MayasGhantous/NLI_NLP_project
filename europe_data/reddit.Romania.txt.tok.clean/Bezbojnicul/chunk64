  people generalize \u201e the west '' and \u201e western europe '' as well . 
  such is life . 
  relevant : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/center_of_europe, 
   ~ ~ one ~ ~ ** three ** of your national languages is a butchered version of latin fixed . 
   czech republic & hungary are parts of central europe . 
  culturally yes . 
  but they are also part of eastern europe in the `` post-communist europe '' sense . 
   mount ararat is to the armenian culture and folklore , what mount olympus is to greece and their history and mythology . 
  difference between the two are , that olympus is deep inside greece , while ararat is just barely in turkey . 
  otoh constantinople is in turkey, 
  * you should ask in / r/linguistics for best/pro answer . 
  * ianalinguist , but afaik agglutination just sticks things to a word to give it a whole lot of context ( gramatical stuff ) but you still have one word basically ( but with add-ons ) . 
  hungarian example : h\u00e1z - house h\u00e1zunk - our house h\u00e1zunkban - in our house and so on . 
  you can get to extreme lenghts with numerous affixes that convey a lot of things . 
  in english one must use prepositions . 
  the german thing you are thinking of is when multiple ( 2 ... 3 ... ) words combine to to form a new , [ compound , word ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compound_words ) . 
   only ie language to be agglutinative , afaik . 
  i went and looked it up , out of curiosity . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_language#morphology  armenian is agglutinative , one of only two indo-european languages with this characteristic , the other one being persian . 
  til, 
  first country to adopt christianity ( ~ 300 ad ) , but it 's not your usual orthodox or catholic christianity . 
  used to stretch from the mediteranean ( cilicia ) to the caucasus way back in the day . 
  closed borders with both turkey and azerbaidjan ( because of the nagorno-karabakh conflict ) . 
  friends with iran and russia . 
  armenian language has 2 versions - eastern and western ( the latter spoken mostly in the diaspora ) . 
  it is part of the indo-european languages , but in a sub-group of its own . 
  it had a significant influence on the language of the roma . 
  also , weird alphabet , related to greek and latin . 
  99 % of names end in * - ian * . 
  most important mountain is ararat , visible from yerevan . 
  but it 's in turkey , so they ca n't go there . 
  only 3 million inhabitants . 
  had a diaspora even before the genocide ( for example in transylvania , where some adopted catholicism , and the rest of romania too ) . 
  * yerevan radio, 
  the first chechen war had no religious component . 
  it was entirely secular nationalist secessionism . 
  is everybody trying to piss off everybody else this summer ? 
   the english and scottish arrived en masse in the 1600 's . 
  ridiculous to suggest that they are `` newcomers '' . 
  romanian nationalist still consider hungarians - who arrived in the 10th century - `` newcomers '' . 
  i 'm sure the albanians consider the south slavs `` newcomers '' as well ( slavs arived in the balkans in the 7th century ) . 
  ridiculous , i know . 
  also in ** romania ** * [ romania to cut vat on bread ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-adresses-irregularities-in-bread-industry ) to expand on the hungarian extremist part : gabor vona said that `` if defending the rights of the hungarians in romania means a conclict with romania , he 's willing to assume that '' . 
  our foreign office asked the hungarian government to distance themselves from vona 's declarations . 
  also some mps have asked the foreign office to declare vona * persona non grata * but they said that this can only be done with diplomats ( which vona is not ) . 
   50 years out of date communist propaganda . 
  even 25 actually  and yeah , it feels like the propaganda of the olden days . 
  it feels like caricature . 
  i sometimes find it hard to believe some people believe this .

  oktoberfest ? 
  should have added the first line as well  mudromu i plemenitomu , i cistitomu i bogom darovanomu jupan han\u0103\u015f bengner ot bra\u015fov mnogo zdravie ot n\u00e9c\u015fu ot dl\u0103gopole . 
  this , the `` i pak '' and the last line are not actually in romanian , but are part of the text . 
  [ viva colonia !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37rpcwyhxle ), 
   too low brow to fit bolintineanu 's pretense . 
  that too . 
  besides bog and dziewica ( which kinda sounds like russian dievushka ) , the others have corespondence in romanian - * rod * - fruit - * slav\u0103 * - grace - * gospodin\u0103 * - means `` lady of the house '' , but i knew `` gospodar '' used to mean any kind of lord - * rai * - heaven, 
  my child, 
  tomorrow , * [ something ] * , at the hour where the fields whiten i will leave . 
  you see , i know you are waiting for me, 
  i rememeber reading aout how poland 's national poet begins a poem with these word  . 
   bogurodzica god-birth-er ? 
   dziewica virgin / young girl  bogiem s\u0142awiena maryja god 's grace mary ? 
   gospodzina lady  matko mother ? 
   kirielejson kirie eleison ( of greek origin , `` lord bless ( ? ) '' ), 
   rajski something about heaven ? 
  * leah * was used in romanian too . 
  it probably entered romanian via italian in the 19th century ( but yeah , it seems to come from ancient greek ) . 
  * ceas * / * ceasornic * would have been the older word used round here ( of slav origin ) . 
  always thought `` ukraina '' means `` at the border '' so i inferred from there  dalej - further i thought it might be related to the * daloy * in '' [ daloy politsey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ft9iuzu0ai ) '' ( down with the police ), 
  i took a stab at * general * because that 's what it means in hungarian ( or * colonel * , now i 'm not sure . 
  some big rank anyway ) . 
   i imagine the poem is quite difficult to digest for foreigners because it uses simple words . 
  yep . 
  maybe i can make out a couple more , but that 's it . 
  1 internet . 
  * orologiu * comes from greek ? 
   tabornjiki is this about a * general * ? 
   tancovat something about * dancing * ? 
  i know , 
  idea : post a stanza or two of poetry , let others guess what it 's about . 
  fuck no ! . 
  i 'll be in southern spain in about a month and want to visit gibraltar too . 
  i 'm in no mood for closed fences and shit . 
  `` slip '' is `` bathing suit ( lower part ) '' in romanian, 
  hungarian as well ( although the meaning of `` light '' is now archaic ) . 
  probably romanian and hungarian were influenced by the slavic use of the word . 
  i confirm he 's an ultranationalist monkey . 
   my business and industry which one ? 
  in case anyone is wondering ( as i did ) `` woc '' = `` woman of color '', 
   one of my friends favorite is fashion , used as an adjective and not a noun , as in `` this outfit is very fashion '' happened in romanian as well . 
  especially when reffering to people . 
  `` she is very fashion '', 
  also : * lume * ( world ) - from latin * lumen * ( light ) * cuv\u00e2nt * ( word ) - from latin * conventum * ( `` assembly '' , related to the english `` convent '' ), 
  could you give a definition of `` pseudo-anglicism '' . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you mean by that . 
   probably the design was not approved by the european commission as it showing a person who looks like jesus christ . 
  is this against design guidlines for the euro ? 
   doesnt the first point imply a ban ?
