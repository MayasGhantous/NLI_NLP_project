  sorta . 
  but as we soon found out , he did have another account to post from . 
  and [ not a new creation at all ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/cock-n-tails ) . 
   both post with similar speech patterns interesting . 
  some examples would be more then welcomed . 
  i agree with you , had it been one comment ( i know i might have phrased it harshly ) . 
  by the time i got involved it was n't the only comment , and he was already up in arms . 
  so a mind your language '' seemed useless when he was already accusing british moderators of censoring opinions . 
  edit . 
  as seen in the screenshot i actually told him to to chill the fuck out and come back . 
  u/theevilscotsman lready mentioned it though, 
   ohhh someone called me a bitch , better remove all of his comments in this thread , ban him salvaxe is not a mod here . 
   but if the reason why he got banned is that he called / u/salvaxe that 's not the reason he got banned . 
  that 's the reason his comment got deleted . 
   `` i 'm going to keep posting '' ? 
  is n't that what we 're supposed to do here ? 
  no , we 're not supposed to spam the same comment over and over . 
  we 're supposed to have civil discussions . 
   and has a different opinion this is not about opinion . 
  plenty of people have voiced pro-spanish opinions on the issue and no mod gave a fuck . 
  first comment that got banned ( and rightly so ) :  no offense , but you seem like a condescending bitch . 
  btw , are you going to delete this comment too ? 
  because you seem to do that everytime you get downvoted ... second comment that got banned ( i do n't agree with it being censored for its content , but the username is questionable , and by the time one got around to reviewing it , he was already kicking and screaming ) :  so let me get this straight ... just because i see both sides of the story , and i do n't necessarily side with you , i 'm now a troll ? 
  unlike you , my opinions are n't colored from living in gibraltar or the uk -- or spain , for that matter . 
  i 've lived in sweden my entire life . 
   speaking of trollish behavior , it seems that all you do here is shit on other countries , post comments in a generally condescending tone , and post racist comments . 
  ( not that i care much about racism , but i 'm still going to call you out on it , because you 're one of the biggest assholes i 've encountered on reddit . ), 
  unfortunately , i ca n't link to any of your worst comments , because you regularly delete all of them -- just like a troll would . 
  after this , basically started comming back with alternative usernames and ending perfectly valid opinions with shit like this :  btw , i 'm replying from a diffrent account , since i was banned and censored by / u/theskynet [ +2 ] -- a british mod -- that apparently * is on a personal vendetta against anyone who does n't unconditionally support gibraltar . 
  * he 's obviously not a huge supporter of free speech . 
  what a sad pathetic little man ... see [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kh5fjw5.png ) . 
  now making threats , both on / r/europe and on modmail is not the way to go , not to mention gratuitous accusations of mod `` vendetta '' . 
  acting like a selfentitled prick gets you nowhere . 
  roma are generally superstitious rather then religious . 
  they usualy adopt the religion of the majority population , while also holding on to some of their own superstitions that they retain irrespective of adopted religion . 
   romania 's church lacks the entrepreneurial spirit , unlike our church . 
  oh , no it do n't . 
  not since the new patriarch . 
  but we 've had a late start cus we 've been held back by the commie years . 
  [ dublin mosque ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/dublin_mosque.jpg/576px-dublin_mosque.jpg ), 
  an article on the subject : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6692881.stm, 
  while i 'm pretty anti-religious , i agree that the neo-protestant churches are the quickest way to integrate roma into society . 
  not to mention a lot of other non-indo-european languages on the fringes , like : * maltese * turkish , as well as other turkic languages such as tatar , balkar , etc. 
  * members of the north-west caucasian family ( adyge , cherkez ) * members of the north-east caucasian family ( cheche , ingush , a lot of others in dagestan ) * kalmyk ( related to mongol ) * other languages related to finnish and hungarian in what is now russia, 
  the rest of eastern europe as well ... 
   frankly , i do n't think the inhabitants of these regions really want complete secession though quite a few have little interest even in autonomy . 
  actually , nobody has any real idea how big support for autonomy actually is ( everybody seems to shy away from making a proper goddam polling ) . 
   all the churches i 've seen built ( about 5 in my old neighborhood ) have been built from private funds ... or mostly private funds how do you know ? 
   when you 're saying huge amounts of money ( please provide source as well ) , you 're talking about priests having a gov n't salary and other stuff like that . 
  no , i 'm not talking about priest salaries ( those are included in the state budget ) . 
  i 'm talking grants ( both money and free land ) by local and national authorities . 
  you can find some links for the 2009-2011 period [ here ] ( http://forum.atei.ro/index.php?topic=2495.0 ) . 
  there were some aditional articles in the press i ca n't seem to find right now . 
   what i meant was how many were destroyed in those 44 years of communism and how many were build afterwards . 
  how many ? 
  afaik about 20-25 were destroyed in bucharest . 
  i have no ideea about the countryside , but i would imagine not that many . 
   does it mean that every 2.33 days the construction of a church starts ? 
  or does it end ? 
  and how did they measure that ? 
  over a month , a year ? 
  is it a constant rate , meaning in 10 years romania will have 1560 new churches ? 
  iirc the number of churches that started being built in the last 24 years divided by the number of days in that period . 
   how many of these churches are being rebuilt because the communist regime destroyed them ? 
  virtually none . 
   i hate it when stuff like this comes out making romania look like some church controlled state ... you can hate it all you want . 
  truth is the church still has significant political clout , and politicians give huge sums of money to the church . 
   i 'll just keep reposing my comments 24/7 , if that 's what it takes ... that 'll show us !, 
   seriously , what the hell is wrong with you brits on / r/europe ? 
  it 's like you completely loose your heads whenever gibraltar is discussed around here . 
  the only only loosing its head is you . 
  take a couple of hours to chill out and com back when you can handle a discussion without resorting to ridiculous drama and `` the mods have a personal vendetta against me '' type stuff . 
   and statism . 
  let me guess ... libertarian ? 
   in greece and other parts of southern europe , it still is , amongst the elderly . ), 
  [ ... and eastern europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gk8ml0g.jpg ), 
  inkscape and i manually transcribed the values ( including angles for the pie-chart ) from an excel sheet ( basically the jpg posted earlier ), 
  what 's wrong with moldova ? 
   last remain of the soviet era ( the look and feel there seems barely untouched . 
  for instance , there are no big advertisements on the buildings nor on the roads ) . 
  not counting transnistria, 
  lukashenko last dictator . 
  killer ` stash , killer regime . 
  secret police still called kgb . 
  most of the chernobyl fallout landed there . 
  a lot of people speak russian instead of the local belarusian . 
  the part of `` greater russia '' that was under lithuanian control . 
  ergo , they share the coat of arms ( at least they did until lukashenko went for a more '80s look ) . 
  share a very old forest with poland . 
  i thank both of you for this . 
  ethnic russians who arrived during soviet times did not get automatic citizenship when the baltics gained independence . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_latvia#current_situation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#current_situation, 
  yes . 
  anybody without citizenship living in cyprus . 
   foreign citizens refer to persons who are not citizens of the country in which they reside . 
  they also include stateless persons . 
  inkscape and love . 
  thank you !,

  i rounded the numbers to fit in the 2-3 cases when % non-eu and eu foreign citizens did n't add up to the total number ( because of rounding ),
