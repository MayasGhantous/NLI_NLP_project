  per la diversita . 
  in context , it feels perfectly ok to me . 
  it 's called agglutination . 
  many languages do it . 
  it 's fucked up if you 're not used to it . 
   try this word : szereteteteket use it in a phrase please . 
   despite your flag you seem to be the go-to person on hungarian history i have only very weak knowledge of hungarian history tbh . 
   cooking i like both food and history   and a huge nazi when it comes to defining the hungarian language as a branch in the family of finno-ugric uralic non indo-european languages . 
  i 'm a fan of linguistics as well . 
  i hang around / r/linguistics quite often ...  i also got ta wonder : have you been waiting for this hungarian episode of the `` what do you know about ... '' series since the beginning ? 
  :-) not really ( i wait for all of them the same , as they are awesome ) . 
  you 'll notice i did n't actually answer the `` what do you know about ... '' question , 
   out of curiosity , my comment seems to really bother you - why ? 
  it does n't bother me * that * much . 
  it 's just that wandering around / r/linguistics taught me saying it 's difficult to say objectively that language x is `` globally classified as difficult '' . 
  as i said , it depends on the learner . 
  i do speak hungarian , so i do realize how different it is from other languages . 
   no i 'm pretty sure is globally classified as such because of the really complex grammar and alphabet . 
  well , how complex a language is to learn really depends on who is learning it . 
  i 'm sure a turk has less trouble with it than a greek , because a greek speaker has many more differences he has to wrap his head around . 
  otoh , lack of gender , vowel harmony and agglutination are not as alien to a turk . 
  cool . 
  thanks !, 
  / u/kingqajar is vary talented when alternative histories are concerned . 
  maybe he can whip up a story , if he sees this . 
   finnish , estonian , hungarian and turkish are related . 
  turkish shares a lot of features with the first 3 , but is not related to them . 
  at least linguists consider they have insufficient evidence to link the 2 language groups , and as such consider them unrelated . 
   finnish/ivorian group . 
  ugrian . 
  ivorian means [ something different ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ivorian )  . 
   dvorak that dude 's czech . 
   omega - the girl with pearl hair link : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tgrhxa2ke0, 
   in the same branch as finnish and estonian , same * family * , different branch . 
  hungarians speakers make up [ more than half of all uralic speakers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#classification_of_languages ) ( see box on the right ) . 
  are flow mai bun , 
   palatschinken which the hungarians borrowed from the romanian `` pl\u0103cint\u0103 '' which in turn comes from the latin `` placenta '', 
   type hungarian food may be an ottoman influence because pre-15th century cookbooks are different . 
  any link to said pre-15th c. cookbooks ? 
  you 've made me curious ... 
   one of the most difficult languages to learn , alongisde the likes of finnish and turkish , * for someone speaking an indo-european language, 
   the relation is more like theoretical , as so many words were taken from turkic , slavic , and german . 
  it 's still an uralic language , even if the uralic vocabulary is in the minority . 
  the most important is the basic vocabulary , and that is very uralic . 
  there are also other aspects taken into account , beside vocabulary , when establishing kinship . 
   their language is one of the few languages related to finnish . 
  there are [ quite a number actually ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/fenno-ugrian_languages.png ) . 
  mostly they are inside russia , so are less well known . 
  41 % consider the state an enemy , 43 % consider it a friend but iirc this poll was taken after the whole szekler flag incident , so the `` enemy '' part might be higher than usual . 
  for context , some other figures in the poll :  russia ( 27 % enemy vs. 50 % friend ) , france ( 13 % enemy vs. 78 % friend ) , marea britanie ( 11 % enemy vs. 75 % friend )  56 % percent consider relations between ro and hu to be good  51 % never visited hungary , but they have a good opinion of the country ( 28 % very good , 63 % good ), 
   friendly western neighbors . 
  but ... but ... they wants to steal * [ our precious ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ) * !, 
  obviously instigated by our southern occupiers !, 
   i always thought roma and romanians had little in common culturally depends . 
  obviously , because our superior transylvanian tolerance ^ ^ tm , we get a larger percentage of roma who are n't afraid to self-declare as such such . 
   we do not talk about the weather for a few minutes just to casually mention we need a task to be done/need a favor . 
  in the states or britain that would be considered to be somewhat rude . 
  reminds me of [ this bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13545386 ), 
  obviously . 
  just the southern romanians are all gypsies * runs away *, 
  i 'm not trying to diminish the suffering . 
  my point was that being fucked indirectly by the turks , rather then directly , as the bulgarians , gave us no significant advantage on the long run . 
  our two countries are basically at the same level as development goes . 
  almost all continental stats place us right next to each other . 
  frederick the great of prussia spoke french and considered german a peasant language . 
  the fact that we had internal autonomy ( we were still under turkish control though ) and they were under direct rule seems to have made little difference on the long run . 
  not to mention the fact that u/beefat99 used present tense . 
  i noticed that after posting this comment . 
   macedonia was a greek society in every possible way you could be one , language , religion , culture , military style , fashion , etc yeah , [ it was n't as clear cut as some people would like to think ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/xayto/how_did_the_ancient_greeks_see_prehellenistic/ ), 
   he 's the reason why romanian is n't part of turkey . 
  like bulgaria is part of turkey ? 
  georgians ... 
  romania as well . 
   so they told me it is because romanians are dirty and they would ruin paper money . 
  * facepalm *, 
   the `` romanian '' nobility lived in the countryside where they could exploit the land and the people better . 
  still it 's interesting that the nobility of braila told stephen the great to go fuck himself in slavonic ( the literary language of the day ) . 
   between the eleven century and the seventeen century romanian was used only by comoners between familly , we progresively used bulgarian , greek and turkish for comerce and administration . 
  we where n't latin at this point , all culture was in a foreign language , because that was oficial at the time . 
  to add context : well , this is true of virtually all european countries . 
  the prestige languages were rarely the vernacular spoken by the plebs ( in the middle ages ) . 
   also , how come they are n't made of polymer yet ? 
  god i 'm gon na miss polymer money when we join the eurozone ... 
   is this russia using religion in an obvious way to centralize its status as a regional authority ? 
  there does n't seem to be any other explanation . 
  well , the russian orthodox church has under it 's authority the belarus orthodox church and the ukrainian orthodox church ( moscow ) . 
  the [ situation in ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine#religion ) is a bit complicated . 
  i got ta run so maybe someone else can expand upon the role of the roc . 
   i thought all of the orthodox churches were seperate entities , and did n't really want anything to do with each other . 
  most orthodox churches recognize each other as equal partners of the same faith . 
  orthodoxy is not centralized like catholicism , but it 's not a free-for-all either , like protestantism ( shall we say ) . 
  also , some places hold great symbolic value in all orthodoxy , like mount athos , in greece . 
  sure , sometimes the churches get worked up into politics , and 2 churches might compete over the same teritory ( like the romanian and russian churches in the republic of moldova ), 
  i think `` group-rape '' would be a good aproximation ...
