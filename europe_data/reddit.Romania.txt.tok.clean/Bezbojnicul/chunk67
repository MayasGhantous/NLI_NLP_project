   the armenian genocide could have happened to us . 
  ( ignoring the modern context of the genocide in question ) did the equivalent of the armenian genocide happen to bulgaria ? 
  they were under direct turkish control . 
  actually , it was more profitable to the turks to just keep us as we were , then to turn us into an elayet ( pasalac ) . 
  sure , we had a few decent statesmen during the centuries , either in moldova or wallachia , but even the great ones realized that there is no real chance for independence . 
  plus , if you went rogue , after the turks came to set you straight , you had to pay tribute retroactively for the years of `` missbehaviour '' . 
  [ art of freedom ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vapt0pruvdg ), 
   and what on earth do you mean by   the preservation of the language , both for them and for us , happened on its own up until the 19th century that there was no conscious effort to preserve the language . 
  it just got preserved . 
  sure , mothers teach their children their language , but there was no pan-romanian movement to not speak something else . 
  it was simply what mother so . 
  they do it anywhere else . 
   so , what 's i 'm talking about is an achievement by the romanian people , done over centuries , passively or at least without a leader taking a decision to do this . 
  exactly . 
  there is no `` achievement '' when there is no intent . 
  it 's like being proud that you managed to grow tall . 
   now , french went far away from latin while romanian stayed close to it . 
  it stayed close in some aspects , and `` went away '' in others . 
   i 'm no expert in finno-ugric languages , but it 's not like hungarians can just walk into a bakery in tallinn and ask for a loaf of bread in hungarian and expect to get it . 
  those cultural influences actually count ... 
  this is totally irrelevant to the point . 
  also , fyi , hungarian and estonian are from separate branches of the finno-ugric family . 
  talking hungarian in estonia is like talking romanian in iran . 
  also , do you think the lithuanians should be proud of the fact that the lithuanian language stayed close to its proto-indo-european roots ? 
  do you think germans should be ashamed their language diverged ?

  basically a history of romanian history .

  thank you . 
  will read the whole link later , when not at work  . 
   also , regarding tuscany in particular , we were the first country in history to abolish death penalty in 1786 . 
  we still celebrate the 30th of november , the day that law was issued , as a holiday here in tuscany . 
  how very cool !, 
   actually we did n't stay latin , we were culturally close to the bulgarian empire , the greek orthodox church and the ottoman empire . 
  we stayed latin linguistically , but not culturally . 
  problem is , romanian thought pretty much equates culture with language , because our linguistic exceptionalism is what we built our national narrative around . 
   but i recently enjoyed reading why is romania different , and i highly recommend it . 
  i actually found the book weaker than his earlier writings . 
   the basques rule in this area i meant it in their area  the hungarians did run ( co-run ) an empire , so they were rarely under the threat of having another culture being imposed on them , quite the opposite . 
  this is a very selective reading of hungarian history ( which is understandable , as romanian historiography tends to emphasize the moments of hungarian strength ) . 
  from the early 16th to the late 18th they did not run or co-run anything and were dominated culturally by turks ( quite directly in what is now hungary ) and austrians . 
  anyway , my point was that the fact that hungarians are just as far from their linguistic kin . 
  also , the preservation of the language , both for them and for us , happened on its own up until the 19th century , so i would n't actually call it an achievement . 
   to weaken hungary first of all . 
  i 'd really like a source on this . 
  i do n't think this is the whole picture tbh . 
  well , it 's true for the hungarians and basques as well then . 
  yeah , but the distribution differs . 
  while slovakia 's hungarians are in a narrow , compact strip right on the border , at least half of romania 's hungarians are inside an enclave in the middle of the country . 
  there are also smaller inland areas in transylvania where hungarians are mixed with romanians ( like cluj county ) . 
  your area could easily have been included in hungary but were not . 
  it does n't seem to have been included in slovakia because of the ethnicity of the inhabitants on ethnic grounds . 
  so i wonder what the rationale was behind it was . 
  agreed . 
  the fact that we made it into the eu as early as we did . 
  i 'd say our ethnic relations are good , and , even with all the flag waving and whatnot , we 're still one of the countries with most significant rights afforded to minorities . 
  also , i 'd say the whole 1850s-to-1920s was a good period ( on the whole , not especially good for the poor peasants ) . 
  we united the romanian speaking regions , starting with alexandru ioan cuza 's sneaky [ union of wallachia and moldavia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_principalities ) to the post wwi union . 
  also , we freed the gypsies from slavery , which is always a plus . 
  also us staying out of 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia is something nice imo . 
  not to mention that with all the internal bad , ceasescu did manage to keep a nice balanced foreign policy . 
  also , our internet rocks !, 
   and forced romania to give up territory it won in the hungarian-romanian war . 
  basically , from the tisa river to the current ro-hu border [ more details on said war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian%e2%80%93romanian_war_of_1919 ), 
   but this was probably less than 10 % of the territory . 
  sure . 
  i 'm not questioning the overall idea of the treaty . 
  i think a lot of people feel that it was unfair even in the context of loosing territory . 
  some regions you really could n't work around . 
  like szekler land .

  * [ more than a month ago ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romanian-passangers-die-in-montenegro-s-canyon-bus-accident ), 
   and the second is that we are still ashamed of having part in soviet invasion of czechoslovakia during prague spring in 1968 good thing we stayed out of that one ... 
  but the dutch speak 4 languages and smoke marijuana !, 
  also the [ deportation of roma to transnistria ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7844797.stm ), 
  true , but some details of it are questionable . 
  i mean the romanian-hungarian border did not only follow ethnic lines but at times economic rationals as well ( oradea - satu mare section ) . 
  also , i wonder why they included so many hungarians inside slovakia . 
   the spanish/portuguese massacred the natives both passively and actively which lead to the majority in most south american nations being european . 
  you 're generalising a bit .

  except for the fact that the round table is about eu-israel relations in general , not `` eu and the israelo-palestinian conflict '', 
  imagine the mayhem when the round table will be about turkey ... 
  a pole in space is still a pole in space . 
   what they 're saying is basically ` all or nothing ' . 
  pretty much . 
  [ poland can into space ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ), 
  i asked [ here ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/horea,_satu_mare ), 
   one of these regions would contain szekeler land in its entirety . 
  local autonomy would be gained , not lost . 
  iirc the most favoured version of the reform would be using the current development regions . 
  under that scheme , szeklerland would be swallowed up in region center , and hungarians would make up only 30 % of said region , so they could still be outvoted in the regional assembly by the romanian parties ( which they obviously do not want ) . 
  they are making a fuss because they want szeklerland to be its own region . 
   it 's not higher than 15-20 % went to the countryside this weekend . 
  asked how big is church attendance .
