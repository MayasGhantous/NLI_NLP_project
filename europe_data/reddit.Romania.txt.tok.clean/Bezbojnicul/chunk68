   source : romanian is the closest language to old latin there exists today . 
  apparently . 
  claiming one language is `` closest '' to old latin ( by which you probably mean classical latin ) is a bit of a strech . 
  while languages can be innovative or conservative , i think it 's wrong to say romanian is the most conservative . 
  it is conservative when it comes to preserving a part of the latin declension system or the neuter gender , it 's innovative in other aspects . 
  i 've heard simmilar claims being made about romansch ( rheto-romance language of switzerland ) and about sardinian ( which is the most conservative of the romance languages in terms of phonology ) . 
   i would pick the flag of my province ( or even municipality ) over my national flag if it were available as the unofficial guardian of the flairs , i can accommodate requests . 
  i\u021bd personally prefer you chose province over municipality , but if you insist on municipality , it can be done , 
   europeans think of `` traditions '' like baby showers and bachelor ( ette ) 's night with strip-teasers as typically american ( which they are ) . 
  i think getting drunk before marriage is probably not an american import , although i 've only heard of bachlorette parties involving strippers , not bachlor parties ( small sample size though ) . 
  also , judging from things popping up on my facebook feed , baby showers are starting to happen too , among young upper-middle class parents . 
  ( i actually had to google it when i first saw it on fb ) also , why the fuck ca n't i select and copy from this damn article ? 
   britain 's leaders must decide once again how best to use their influence in europe . 
  the eu is an english - speaking power . 
  the single market was a british idea . 
  a british commissioner runs our diplomatic service . 
  you could , if only you wished , lead europe 's defence policy . 
   but please do n't expect us to help you to wreck or paralyse the eu . 
  do n't underestimate our determination not to return to the politics of the 20th century . 
  you were not occupied . 
  most of us on the continent were . 
  we 'll do almost anything to prevent it happening again . 
  europe 's leaders will step up integration to make the euro work . 
  we believe the euro will survive , because it is in members ' interests for it to survive . 
  i think this is the essence of his message . 
  britain can find allies inside the eu to push for a more right-wing free-market politics , but only inside the eu . 
  the uk could wield a lot of influence if it tried . 
  but the right-leaning countries of eastern europe would never follow the uk out of the eu . 
   do n't underestimate our determination not to return to the politics of the 20th century . 
  you were not occupied . 
  most of us on the continent were . 
  we 'll do almost anything to prevent it happening again . 
  this really hit close to home , and it represents the feelings of a lot of eastern europeans . 
  even the ones that are not too thrilled about brussels still consider the eu the lesser of 2 evils , when judged against russia . 
  and we know that going solo is not an option . 
   if not , why not ? 
  because the best flair to explain where i come from ( what the context of my position is ) is the national flag . 
  it already signals that i am an eu citizen , but it 's more specific than an eu flag ( which i feel would be too vague ) . 
  also , it 's the least political choice imo . 
  his tweezed eyebrows make it difficult to concentrate  also , he has an interesting accent . 
  is it american-influenced accent or what ? 
  roman\u0219\u0103 ? 
  yes . 
  interesting . 
  is it in a local galo-italic dialect ?

  [ aaa ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kamel%c3%a5s%c3%a5 ), 
   i do n't like this poll . 
  they asked how many people consider themselves `` convinced atheists '' . 
  well then that explains romania to an extent . 
  the word `` atheist '' is seen by many to be virtually synonymous with `` antireligious communist that would gulag the believers '' . 
   responded that he is agnostic , but guess what , there was n't a box with that option there were no boxes with options at all . 
  there was a dotted line where you could have them write anything and a box to include a 2 digit number ( the code ) . 
  there was a list of religions ( the state recognized denominations ) each with its own code , as well as both `` atheist '' and `` no religion '' as options , both with individual codes , plus the `` other '' option ( for buddist , bahai , jedi , shinto and so on ) and the census-taker should have known that . 
  your cousin should have informed himself and should n't have let the census-taker push him around . 
   it 's not higher than 15-20 % and much less in the cities . 
  i do n't know what villages you 've been visiting , but church attendance is much higher than 15-20 % in the rural areas ( maybe that number is closer to what city church attendance is ) . 
   most religious countries [ ... ]  romania goddamit !, 
  of course . 
  it 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  i mean helping american corporations abroad is beneficial for the american state , economically speaking . 
  would you consider bulgarian ambassadors lobbying for bulgarian companies abroad a bad thing ? 
  still , the current pm is independent , so the political aspect is a bit more diluted than what we had . 
  also , after some quick googling , it seems her statements were n't against the protests per se ( or maybe i have to look a bit more ) but against the way the transition of power took place . 
  basescu is epp , just like reding . 
  it 's actually the non-szeklers who are more prone to assimilation and who have to `` fight for their culture '' . 
  the szeklers are safer as their area is much more homogenous , and can easily assimilate members of other ethnicities . 
  for example , someone from a mixed family is much more likely to assimilate as a hungarian in szeklerland , while someone from a mixed amily outside szeklerland will most likely assimilate into the romanian majority . 
  the szeklers are more `` nationally conscious '' because they are more `` rural '' .
