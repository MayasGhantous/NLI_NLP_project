  tunisia in 2000 , as a tourist with me folks . 
  very fun , but very hot and chaotic . 
   what 's your country 's current relationship like with particular countries in africa ? 
  we 've always had good relations with : 1 . 
  arab countries there 2 . 
  francophone countries there 3 . 
  left-leaning countries there now i could n't tell you how much we 're still engaged with these countries . 
  i know there was some talk during the liyan civil war about how we let relations with ghaddafi whither post-1989 , when we started concentrating on eu and nato and how we had some good deals back in the 80s with them ( we have petrochemical engineers for example ) . 
   what do you think of the continent 's future as it relates to europe ? 
  i think northern africa should be viewed as strategically important , and the eu should put every effort in to help those countries remain stable and help develop democratic institutions . 
  but my point is that it 's the constitutional court that decides if article 1 conflicts with a szekler authonomous region if it ever comes to that . 
  and the cc will have a much more legalistic approach than the average joe . 
  sure , the average romanian is as you say . 
  why ? 
  they are rural mountainfolk , and thus a bit thickheaded ( think hill-billyes ) . 
  they also have a strong regional identity ( they had a tradition of local autonomy up untill the 19th century ) , and are a bit more nationalist than your average hungarian . 
  might be a combination of inferiority complex ( being looked down by regular hungarians ) and superiority complex ( they think they are descended from attila 's huns , which is most likely a myth ) . 
  source : half-szekely myself . 
   that phrase really depends on each country 's interpretation . 
  i do n't think that it 's that interpretable tbh ( i do think the general populace misunderstands the concept though ) . 
  `` unitary state '' is basically the opposite of federal state . 
  in a federal state , a number of states band together and give some power to the central authority ( think germany ) . 
  in a unitary state , it 's the central authority that devolves power to it 's constituent parts . 
  agreed with the rest of your comment . 
  afaik , the most popular option now is to use the current [ development regions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/development_regions_of_romania ) . 
  under that setup , szeklerland would fall inside the [ central region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centru_%28development_region%29 ) and the hungarian population would be 30 % of that region 's population . 
  i 'm not sure what plan you 're referring to ? 
  ( i know there have been various propositions ), 
  http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0a1  article 1  ( 1 ) romania is a sovereign , independent , unitary and indivisible national state . 
   ( 2 ) the form of government of the romanian state is a republic . 
   ( 3 ) romania is a democratic and social state , governed by the rule of law , in which human dignity , the citizens ' rights and freedoms , the free development of human personality , justice and political pluralism represent supreme values , in the spirit of the democratic traditions of the romanian people and the ideals of the revolution of december 1989 , and shall be guaranteed . 
   ( 4 ) the state shall be organized based on the principle of the separation and balance of powers - legislative , executive , and judicial - within the framework of constitutional democracy . 
   ( 5 ) in romania , the observance of the constitution , its supremacy and the laws shall be mandatory . 
  there is literally nothing here to prevent the creation of a szekler autonomous region . 
  people usually invoke paragraf 1 ( `` romania is a sovereign , independent , unitary and indivisible national state . '' ), 
  with emphasis on `` unitary '' , `` indivisible '' or `` nation-state '' . 
  a lot of people think a `` unitary stat '' bars the existence of autonomous regions . 
  italy and spain are both `` unitary states '' and have autonomous regions . 
  the two concepts are not mutually exclusive . 
  others focus on `` indivisible '' and argue that a szekler autonomous region would `` divide '' the country . 
  this is a false interpretation , as that element safeguards against secession , not devolution , or things like administrative * divisions * . 
  a lot of people conflate autonomy with secession out of either ignorance , or malice . 
  now the `` nation-state '' imo concerns the more modern idea that all citizens are part of `` the nation '' , not that it 's an `` ethnic romanian state '' . 
  while hungary 's fidesz is conservative and softly nationalistic ( on the international stage mostly ) and does have xenophobic members , i would n't call the party xenophobic . 
  the hungarian minority in romania are not a big fan of the transylvanian hungarian people 's party ( emnp ) . 
  udmr/rmdsz are the dominant hungarian party by far ( see last election results ) , althouth udmr supports autonomy as well . 
  tbh , nobody really knows how big support for autonomous regions is among the hungarian minority ( it might be big , it might not be ) . 
  in oradea , there were about [ 300 ] ( http://www.ebihoreanul.ro/stiri/ultima-or-31-1-20/ppmt-istii-au-protestat-impotriva-regionalizarii-usl-pentru-un-partium-unit-autonom-si-bilingv-dar-si-impotriva-udmr-foto--109471.html ) to [ 700 ] ( http://erdely.ma/autonomia.php?id=145836&amp;cim=nagyvaradon_is_kialltak_a_tortenelmi_regiokert ) protesters ( depending on source ) , mainly elders , and i 'm sure part of them were there because of the renaming of a park from its historical name to a more romanian name than because of autonomy ( in this case , for a bilingual partium region ) . 
   question from people actually living in romania : how big were these protests ? 
  small . 
  even the romanian press , always eager to report on this , paid little attention to it . 
   nr 1 article in the constituion does not allow this this is one interpretation of article 1 i do not agree with . 
  their identity crisis is their identity :p, 
  was about to post this myself . 
  probably because westerners are not as misinformed as romanians imagine them to be . 
  yep . 
  a lot of people are very annoyed by that fact , and by the fact that they feel that westerners confuse roma with romanian , and thus think `` all romanians are gypsies '' . 
  it gets attention mostly when there is an article about it in the foreign press , or when foreign authorities take some measure against them ( like sending them home ) . 
  might have something to do with the [ galatians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galatia ), 
   is it right for someone to be in support of the european union and european unity but then also be in support of independence movements that actively try to break apart from european countries ? 
  actually , i think one stems from the other . 
  as europe becomes more and more united and more and more power is handed over to brussels , the unity of the constituent countries becomes less and less relevant . 
  if borders become less like actual border fences and more like [ lines separating provinces ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/baarle-nassau_fronti%c3%a8re_caf%c3%a9.jpg/640px-baarle-nassau_fronti%c3%a8re_caf%c3%a9.jpg ) , while a lot of decisions happen at eu level , you can have way more flexible interstate borders because there is less reason to keep the state together . 
  if catalonia becomes independent , with schengen and all you wo n't feel the border any more than you do today . 
  so secession means less separation than it did in the past .

  i think may 1 ^ st is the next big holiday after these 2 , which consists of going out picnicking and barbecuing . 
   and we celebrate it by eathing a really really really big meal :-d so just like easter and christmas ? 
  many christians as well . 
  it was n't a muslim who came up with the classic : \u201e they eat da poo-poo ! '', 
   and do not wish to politically and religiously change our social structure . 
  you had similar paranoia as well about the germans and the catholics way back in the day . 
  this one is awesome :  from 60 % , nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions ( including non-conforming muslims ) , sporadic ethnic cleansing ( genocide ) , use of sharia law as a weapon , and jizya , the tax placed on infidels , such as in : ** albania ** -- muslim 70 % what a simplistic and/or factually incorrect piece of rubbish . 
   the answer to this question is quite simple no it 's not . 
   humans are a tribal species . 
  it goes down to the basic level . 
  so does the tendency to generalize , to stereotype , and to dehumanize the perceived enemy . 
   i 'm not good with words , hope this paragraph makes sense . 
  it does . 
   and the rest of the users dont have a problem with it , saying well its not a lie so its ok . let 's not generalize . 
   islam has absolutely nothing to do with race . 
  in western european context it does . 
  most muslims in those countries are not white . 
  they are either middle-eastern , south-asian or ( to a lesser extent ) black . 
  so attacking their religion can be a convenient proxy for racism . 
  i know i celebrate christmas once a year and easter twice a year ( both western and eastern style ) . 
  forgot to ad i 'm an atheist .

   because ** he thought islam was an intruder in europe ** . 
  can you find me a source where he says this ? 
   its called being moderate and is nothing exclusive to bosnia . 
  no , but the [ balkan muslims do tend to be more moderate ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/balkans-muslims-more-secular-than-their-peers ) than muslims in the elsewhere . 
  i think former ussr muslims ( all the '' - stan `` s ) are moderate as well ( baring chechnya ) . 
  i agree . 
  yeah , i remember a piss-drunk saudi guy telling me how islam is the one true religion , because it 's the word of god .
