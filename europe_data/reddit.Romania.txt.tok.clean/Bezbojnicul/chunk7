   i find it highly unlikely for the us to get involved in a war to protect romania . 
  if it does n't , any security guaranty the us ever made means nothing . 
  the implications of not defending a `` nato ally '' are huge , be it romania or anybody else . 
  georgia and ukraine had nothing close to the level of a security treaty . 
   we will see how the recognition will look like translation : \u201e we 're gon na interpret `` recognition '' very broadly . '' . 
  do n't get your hopes up . 
  united kingdom of britains and northern ireland, 
   i think the explanation is quite simple : hungary does not border russia and is surrounded by friendly ( or at least non-agressive ) countries . 
  well , romania does n't border russia either , but we 're as afraid of russia as poland . 
   painted monasteries those are in the romanian half .

  i 've heard , both from a romanian and a russian that [ old orhei ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/moldova_orheiul_vechi.jpg ) is worth a visit . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_orhei ) :  the ancient city old orhei - a unique natural and historical complex in the open air . 
  it organically combines the natural landscape and vestiges of ancient civilizations . 
  as a result of enormous archeological excavations here there were discovered the cultural layers of different epochs such as - the paleolithic , eneolithic , and iron age . 
   old orhei contains traces of different civilizations , including the rests of earthen and wooden fortresses of geto-dacian fortress ( 6th-1st centuries . 
  ) , golden horde fort shehr al-jedid ( or yangi-shehr ) ( 14th century . 
  ) , moldavian fort ( 14th-16th centuries ) , orthodox monasteries ( c 14th century . 
  ) , and the moldavian town orheiul vechi ( old orhei ) ( 14th-16th centuries ) . 
  why ? 
  your username really ties the comment together ... 
  so i found [ this map ] ( http://www.scholtoi.de/pdf/deutschebessarabien.pdf ) ^ ^ [ pdf ] of bessarabia german settlements . 
  the one that seem the most likely is kurudschika ( or to mimic your spelling kurujika ) . 
  it 's in ukraine , close to the border with moldova , in [ tarutyne raion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarutyne_raion ) and according to [ this ethnic map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/b/b9/bb_harta_bugeac_basarabia_de_sud_1930.png ) of southern bessarabia , it was an ethnic german village in 1930 ( it appears on the map as * curugica * ) . 
  today it is named sukhuvate ( \u0421\u0443\u0445\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435 ) , and the [ german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/suchuwate ) gives an alternative ( old ? ), 
  russian spelling of \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0430 which is could be easily transliterated as kurijika ( very close to your spelling ) .

  depends . 
  are n't the yazidi ethnic kurds , therefor in favor of a secular independent kurdistan ? 
  isis is sunni * arab * after all , and the kurds are way more secular than the arabs afaik . 
  please do n't editorialze the title . 
  resubmit it please with the original title . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
   r alevi ( dersim , alevi vilages in anatolia ) areas in turkey he would be killed violently i get why the western turks hate him , but why the alevis ? 
  there was a croatia-less version some time ago . 
  actually , they get nothing . 
  the `` rock '' is , it seems , the meteora monasteries , which are in greece . 
   i say were because we 're almost gypsy free now . 
  this is very far from the truth , actually .

  * regarding their strictness , i 'm not sure how strict they are applied , as i do n't remember them ever being used . 
  also , i do n't know if romania considers itself to be officially at war with isis tbh .

  the romanian state was more reluctant to give properties back ( it did in the end , so it 's a mix of both ) . 
  it 's actually because of the transition from one regime to another . 
  there was a figaro article about a year ago that explains in part why romania is the way it is . 
  [ g!translated ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.challenges.fr%2feconomie%2f20130814.cha3051%2fimmobilier-la-roumanie-compte-bien-plus-de-proprietaires-que-la-france.html&amp;edit-text= ) :  * the case of romania is exemplary . 
  `` after the fall of communism and ceausescu in 1989 , the successive governments restored private ownership of property that had been nationalized during the communist period , '' said laurent henrio-lacombe , director of 37 capital , real estate specialist abroad . 
  this causes a massive influx of goods on the market . 
  `` the laws of 1990 and 1992 and helped more than 3 million romanian ` tenants ' to own their homes . 
  and they were able to buy at bargain prices the apartments they lived between 100,000 and 250,000 lei lei ( 22,000 to 55,000 euros ) , `` says laurent henrio-lacombe . 
  the inflation rampant in post-communist then reduce again the absolute value of real estate in the country . 
  *  * in most countries of the former soviet bloc , this pattern is repeated . 
  which is why there are many more owners in europe east than west . 
  however , it is difficult to give a common explanation for each country is a special case and the reasons can vary widely between neighboring territories yet . 
  * the article than goes on to talk about some other countries ( spain , germany , switzerland , france ) . 
  also , [ a map of percent of homeowners ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2013-08-16-15390913-41-harta-proprietarilor-chiriasilor-europa.jpg ) i found in [ a romanian article ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-15390657-romania-are-cei-mai-multi-proprietari-din-europa-99-6-din-populatie-date-eurostat-2011.htm ) . 
  i agree . 
   mu\u011flaite / mu\u011flaer / mu\u011flaian what 's this ? 
   the only good things in romania are a result of german influence . 
  if you mean the hohenzollern dinasty , only 2 out of 4 kings were outstanding , and a big chunk of romania 's modernisation was done by cuza and kog\u0103lniceanu . 
  i love his candidacy because it 's so confusing for the simple-minded . 
  do we love him because `` german efficiency '' or do we hate him because `` he foreign '' ?
