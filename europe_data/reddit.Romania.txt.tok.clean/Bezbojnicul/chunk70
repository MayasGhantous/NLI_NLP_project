   is communist-bashing different from muslim-bashing ? 
  in the context of the current discussion , it is different . 
  unlike muslims , communists are not disproportionately found in an immigrant population of different race . 
  muslim-bashing has been used as a proxy for different-race-bashing . 
  that notwithstanding , religious identities and political options are most of the time treated differently by individuals who hold them . 
  political identities are something that people only start thinking about in their teens , while religious identities are usually formed in the family from an early age . 
  it 's more central to the core identity of an individual . 
  that 's why we view them as not quite the same . 
  i do n't know of many people who were `` raised communist '' or `` raised liberal '' , but do know of lots of `` raised [ religion x ] '' . 
  also a thing i should note , if we 're making parallels , is that muslim bashing is simmilar to leftis-bashing or rightist-bashing . 
  calling all muslims `` fundametalist '' , which a lot of people seem to equate , is like calling all leftists `` communists '' or all rightists `` fascists '' . 
   so if i 'm allowed to go out and insult communists publicly , i do n't see why i should n't be able to do so with muslims . 
  in theory , i agree . 
   it might be distasteful , but it 's still not racist . 
  it is when it 's used as a proxy for racism . 
  all those things give frustrated young males a channel to vent their anger . 
  i always liked the way [ maajid nawas gives his inside perspective as to why he became an extremist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1cu8zzipkc ) . 
  still , in europe , one can say that muslims is more conservative than christians ( for example ) . 
  but those are just problematic statements . 
  balkan muslims are not on the same level as western european immigrant muslims , and catholicism in europe is not on the same level of conservativism as evangelical european or orthodox europeans . 
  i do agree that most believers are regular people . 
   are you talking about america and the effect european settlers had on the native population ? 
  it 's not even about immigration really , it 's about vast culture differences . 
  what is perceived as `` vast cultural differences '' . 
  one hundred years ago the anglo-saxon protestants were scared of catholic immigration ( irish , german , italian ) , seing it as incompatible with local democratic culture . 
   what about the roman empire ? 
  multiculturalism and vast expansion was the death of it . 
  vast expansion , yes . 
  `` multiculturalism '' i highly doubt it . 
  this is a really simplistic way of looking at things . 
   people self segregate for a reason . 
  they like being with ** people like them ** . 
  \u201e like them '' does not necessarily mean \u201e the same culture as them '' or \u201e the same race as them '' . 
  culture varies a lot vertically as well in a society . 
  how one defines the \u201e us '' and the \u201e them '' can be on numerous arbitrary things . 
  to an outsider , there are little differences between a serb and a croat . 
  to a croat , it 's not unlikely to not view serbs as \u201e people like them '' . 
  or \u201e muslim indians '' vs \u201e pakistanis '' . 
  i 'm sure a lot of brits consider black londoners closer to themselves culturally than a white romanian villager . 
   the reasons their country is a third world toilet are brought with them , and you 're making a huge mistake if you think they wo n't do that to the host country . 
  i 'm always surprised how those that defend the awesomeness of european culture ( i agree it 's quite awesome ) have so little faith in the prestige and assimilating power of the culture they so love and cherish . 
   that said , yes , muslims from the arab world in general are really problematic as a group and even then , it probably depends which arab country one comes from , and which social cathegory . 
  problem is that a lot of people think muslim-bashing is `` criticism of islam '' . 
  saudi arabia . 
  they have high prestige ( as guardians of mecca and medina ) and lots of money to spend on spreading their hardcore version of islam . 
  somewhat simmilar to how evangelicals spread in a lot of countries . 
  they have the prestige of america plus a whole lot of money . 
  that goes a long way in helping you convert others . 
  add to that the fact that the ideological zeitgeist is changing ( and has been for some time ) from secular nationalist to post-national cultural-religious identities . 
  they need to build more of a reputation . 
  * looks at flair * typical austria ... 
  probably votes mainly by eastern europe . 
  could you arrange it in descending order as well ? 
  pretty please ? 
  [ these 3 beauties ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ultd5vf.png ) are also worth mentioning . 
  all in the same article . 
  please note the usernames as well . 
  more like eastern european . 
  right-o , wolfie dear !, 
  cup ` o'tea !, 
   and your answer must have been : `` i support independence '' i think many people read it as `` i support independence * if they want it * '', 
   i thought reddit was about 50/50 gender-wise nowadays , i wonder why we have such an imbalance ? 
  even if reddit is balanced , users of different genders might gravitate towards different tipes of sub-reddits . 
   had its own fascist rule during wwii . 
  wow , til . 
  [ this is very interesting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sammarinese_fascist_party ), 
  they exist because the state provided refuge to garibaldi when he was being hunted . 
  in return , he did n't anschluss them . 
  oldest existent republic iirc . 
  `` most serene '' one , as well . 
  coa features 3 towers . 
  it 's basically [ the 3 towers that exist there ] ( http://www.eurotrips.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/san-marino12.jpg ) you can see the coast from there . 
   with alsace as the trilingual capital region ( french , german , alsatian ) , strasbourg as the capital city , and the rest of france and germany as the two states ( each with their administrative divisions ) . 
  sounds like a belgium . 
  we 'll it ai n't running smoothly either , now is it ? 
  as promissed : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ikjhs/the_shadow_economy_in_europe_map_for_2012/, 
  source for info : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ijqy6/the_shadow_economy_in_europe/ i chose the data for 2012 because it 's the latest , without being ` estimates ' . 
   i mean , we would need one euro sceptic , one opposed to increased contributions , one advocating more funds going to the eu , and unapologetic advocate of the eu which were all well known enough to be recognisable and for the election to actually be legitimate . 
  i can say for sure all these cathegories of people will pop up if europresidentials take place . 
  i do n't think i should propose the candidates as well . 
  that 's why we have election campaigns . 
  so the candidates can make themselves known . 
   we would also have to vote for a leader most probably from a different country in order our votes do n't get lost . 
  i do n't think we should care if the candidate is from another country . 
   i still could not name a good potential president candidate . 
  well is n't that why we have election campaigns ? 
  i asked preciselly because i remember that thread , and i remember western european history being biased like the eastern european . 
  emphasize the great , minimize the bad . 
  i know it has drawbacks , especially if the president has considerable powers ( i had in mind a weak president , but one that can act as a unnifying figure ), 
   eastern europeans still exercise revisionist nationalist history mind giving examples as to what you mean ? 
  and how it compares to western europe . 
   many nations already do not meet their * national defence requirements as set out in nato * what do you mean by this ? 
   and others will follow . 
  like who ? 
  how about a popularly elected president . 
  i think that would be a great step forward . 
   it is very fun to check the different way they teach history in the different balkan countries - fun time for everyone . 
  reading `` the hungarians '' by pal lendvai was a real eye-opener . 
  i 'm half hungarian , but i only studied romanian history in school . 
  reading the hungarian perspective explained a lot of things that seemed weird .
