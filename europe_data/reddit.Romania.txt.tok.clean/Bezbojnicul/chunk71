   and people calling themselves a bunch of things at the same time . 
  national identity was not a thing at that time i know . 
  case in point : both we and the hungarians claim john hunyadi and his son , matthias corvinus ( greatest hungarian king ) as `` our own '' . 
   people lived along each other without caring a lot . 
  people still had plenty of religious and class reasons to hate each other . 
   thus a wallachian would be just a guy that lives in wallachia , no matter if he is from bulgarian , romanian or chinese origin . 
  however this was not very convenient for the forming of national identity that took part in the 18-19th century . 
  there is [ a very nice letter ] ( http://tiparituriromanesti.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/corespondenta-intre-stefan-cel-mare-si-boierii-braileni-1481/ ) that the boyars of braila ( in wallachia ) sent to stephen the great , ruler of moldavia , in which they basically tell him to go fuck himself ( in response to one of his letters demanding something ) . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/repin_cossacks.jpg ) . 
  also , there are a lot of battles in which the 2 principalities fought against each other , one on the side of the ottomans ( blasphemy !, 
  ) , the other on the side of the hungarians ( double blasphemy !! ) . 
  but the official narrative stresses the moments of `` brotherhood '' and whatnot , as if they felt their shared `` nationhood '' , which of course is bs . 
   he myth of the noble and mighty [ insert balkan nation here ] used to rule all over the place and was never defeated in an honest fight , until betrayed by our neighbours / defeated by the ottoman horde was born . . my favorite is the `` if it was n't for us , europe would be muslim now '' where `` us '' is used by every nation from vienna to tbilisi . 
   this is a cross-border police co-operation effort and would exist regardless of our status in the eu or participation in various eu directives . 
  it has nothing to do with government and is n't being forced in the first place . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  thanks . 
  if nobody does it i 'll put the number on maps later today . 
  a lot of what you said is ommited in romanian history class . 
   well in the time between 681 - 1018 it was part of the first bulgarian tsardom . 
  ommited  then it became the byzantine thema paristrion mentioned  and then it became a part of the second bulgarian tsardom sbt is mentioned as the bulgaro-vlach tsardom and the lesson focuses on the `` vlach '' origins of the assan dinasty . 
   with knyazes and voivods being appointed by and loyal to the bulgarian tsar . 
  ommited  around 1330 after the battle of possada it became autonomous knyazdom and later - somewhere in the early xv-th century - independent the battle of posada , against the hungarian king is the moment wallachia became independent . 
  what are you thinking of when mentioning the `` xv-th century '' ? 
  but this is not like a requirement by the eu , that one would need to opt-out of . 
  it 's just cross border cooperation , no ? 
  one can do it or not , it 's not a eu directive or anything . 
  i remember [ news ] ( http://www.bihon.ro/patruleaza-cu-politisti-ungari-in-padis-si-hajduszoboszlo/1153251 ) about cross border cooperation within my own [ biharia euroregion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biharia_euroregion ) . 
  hungarian cops joining romanian ones in the apuseni mountains in romania and romanian cops joining hungarian ones at the spas in hungary . 
  because tourists . 
  no , seriously . 
  i do n't understand the above comment . 
  why ? 
  i smoke when i drink . 
  first sip of beer , first cigarette . 
  the only time i crave it is when i drink alcohol , and that 's usually friday night . 
  i know a lot of people crave it when under stress , but i think i substituted that with 10 minutes of reddit . 
  i 've been smoking 13 years now , and have smoked on a daily basis in the past . 
  i consider myself a smoker , although now many times i just smoke 1 night a week ( usually 1/2 -1 pack ) . 
  i think if smoking was forbiden in pubs , i 'd be down to 3-4 cigarettes a week . 
   that might me true for his fidesz party well , he was talking about fidesz . 
   but his junior partner in the parliament , jobbik , is defenitely more than just `` conservative-nationalist '' . 
  yeah , i agree that jobbik are full blown nazis , but i do n't think that they should be qualified as fidesz 's `` junior partners '' . 
  they are effectively in opposition . 
   into what is properly a nazi party . 
  let 's not exagerate . 
  it 's right-wing conservative-nationalist , but it 's no way a `` nazi party '' . 
  and imo putin is way worse then him . 
   if there are any real stories , the ones in charge of these campaigns are doing a piss-poor job at revealing them . 
  there was a series of articles in evenimentul zilei about succesful roma . 
  and i mean `` engineering phd '' succesfull . 
  but i agree . 
  they should do a better job to point out the succesful roma . 
  i know there are enough normal , average and above type gypsies all over this country . 
   the boy failed because he could n't be bothered to work on his research paper , he offended everyone when he asked us to give him our research papers which we 've worked on for an antire year , just one week before they were supposed to be finished . 
  there are plenty of non-roma like this . 
  i have found this :  there is no information to tell us exactly where romani people find work in today 's labour market . 
  but indications are that those who are in formal employment are working in the secondary labour market where employment is in low skilled , low paid menial jobs . [ ... ], 
   the informal sector is a provider of work for many roma . ^ 3 indications are that there is still a demand , although significantly diminished , for romani men to continue to do the same jobs that they have always done , but these jobs are now in the informal sector and lower paid than before . 
  this kind of work tends to be irregular , low paid and usually obtained through informal word of mouth networks . 
  source : [ the situation of roma in the employment sector ] ( http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/mediaarchive/pdfevents/a.%20hyde%20roma%20in%20employment%20sector.pdf ) . 
  which lead me to :  unemployment issues also relate to di\ufb00erent types of income generation activities ( pertaining , for example , to monetary and non-monetary incomes ) . 
  roma who stay out of the formal labour market are often involved in income generation in the shadow economy or subsistence agriculture . ^ 57 graph 13 demonstrates this phenomenon across countries , reporting the percents of employed roma working in the formal or informal sectors . 
  consistent with the data cited above , involvement in informal sector activities in romania is particularly high . 
  although there are relatively low unemployment rates for roma in romania , they are mirrored by relatively high involvement in informal sector activities . 
  although `` only '' one in four romanian roma is unemployed , of those involved in income generation activities , less than one in three obtains employment in the formal sector . 
  [ avoiding the dependency trap the roma human development report ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/regional/europethecis/avoiding_the_dependency_trap_en.pdf ) 2003 report of the the united nations development programme also found in romanian something :  ocupare larg ne\u00eenregistrat\u00e3 ( 63 % - fleck & rughinis , 2008 ) si majoritar \u00eenocupatii necalificate ; [ incluziunea romilor din rom\u00e2nia : politici , institutii , experiente ] ( http://www.academia.edu/1925472/migratia_si_mobilitatea_romilor_pe_piata_muncii_europene-_intre_realitati_si_mituri ) , page 75 . 
   is being intelligent and hardworking called `` acting white '' the traditional roma ( which are a specific subset ) are quite against assimilating i think , and i guess there is something like `` acting gadje '' in their worldview . 
  but you have to think of them as more like the amish , then ghetto thugs . 
  isolated communities , patriarchal , with traditional crafts ( metalurgy mostly ) . 
  they wo n't even marry other types of roma , so it 's not necessarily a race thing . 
  more like a caste thing . 
  the roma you would think of as the equivalent of `` ghetto thugs '' do n't have a problem with marrying gadje . 
  many of them are half-assimilated ethnically and do n't even speak romani anymore . 
   they 'd rather beg or live on state aid ( mostly from the money the government provides for each child - and they have many ) instead of doing manual/low skilled labor . 
  a lot of unskilled work , on construction sites and whatnot is done by roma . 
   the problem with their `` integration '' is on their part yes , this is a two-way street . 
   when asked about the discrimination she faced throughout her life in romania she said `` in all honesty i have never felt discriminated in these 40 + years '' but continued and said that unlike most roma parents , her father sent her to school one story is hardly statistically significant . 
  i 'm not saying it 's not true , but others have different stories , although i 've noticed that strong , ambitious parents do seem to be a common feature of most `` successful roma '' stories . 
  it does actually , to some extent . 
  once they integrate , a lot refuse to acknowledge their roma heritage , so the gypsies that do well are eager to not be associated with the `` gypsy '' label . 
  it 's not a coincidence that there are around 2 million roma in romania , but only 600.000 self-identified as such at last year 's census . 
  add to this the fact that , due to the prevailing stereotypes and the social nuances of the word gypsy , the less stereotypical ( poor , dubious behaviour ) a gypsy is , the less he 's likely to be perceived as a gypsy . 
  [ these 3 mps ] ( http://www.ziuanews.ro/static/i/imagini-articole/572/in-cursa-pentru-mandate-romii-le-au-luat-fata-taranistilor-87311-1.jpg ) are roma , but they could pass as non-roma . 
  dress them up in ragged clothes , and only the middle one might still have a chance of passing off as a gadje . 
   i do n't really know what you 're asking ; your initial post makes it sound like you 're talking about a federalised eu but in another reply you say it 's imperative that individual states maintain their sovereignty and unique cultural identity ? 
  the two are mutually exclusive . [ ... ], 
   at this point , further integration of the eu is impossible without eroding those two things sovereignty , yes , it will erode . 
  cultural identity , not necessarily .

  * ** [ into eternity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/into_eternity_%28film%29 ) ** - a finnish documentary about a deep geological repository for nuclear waste . 
  this film explores the question of preparing the site so that it is not disturbed for 100,000 years , even though no structure in human history has stayed standing for such a long period . 
  ( have seen it half way through , but it 's very interesting ) and while we 're on topic , there is a very good documentary film festival called [ astra film festival ] ( http://www.astrafilm.ro/about-aff.aspx ) in sibiu , romania . 
  romania is even worse .
