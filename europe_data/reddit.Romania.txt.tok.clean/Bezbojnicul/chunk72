  about the same length of completed highways as bulgaria , but twice the size . 
   and how wallachia became autonomous . 
  what are you referring to exactly ? 
  the czech also have a europafm , only it 's called frekvence1 , but you can recognize it by the intro tune . 
  it is part of the [ british isles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) . 
  what you are reffering to are the [ british islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_islands ), 
  yeah . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  i was thinking of `` united ireland '', 
  this is still very approximate . 
   one parent born in france , other foreign-born : 13.3 % could still include non-cross-religious marriages . 
  native born muslim marrying foreign-born mulsim , and native christian marrying immigrant christian . 
   however , attempts have recently been made to downplay the political aspects of the marches and present the twelfth as a cultural , family-friendly event at which tourists are welcome . 
  in belfast , for example , it has been re-branded as orangefest . 
  this is a good thing . 
  i also wonder what the ~ ~ unionist ~ ~ nationalist equivalent is . 
  like `` greenfest '' or something . 
  part of the british isles . 
  all from the land are british . 
   irish is technically one if 3 correct terms . 
  it 's not that correct , given how irish more often then not means either `` ethnic irish '' or `` irish citizen '' ( which they do n't identify with/are not ) . 
  regarding the meaning of words , `` technically correct '' is often not the best kind of correct . 
  it 's like arguing that you 're ` british ' because ireland is part of the british isles . 
  did a bit of research . 
  [ this 2010 article says ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/romania-xxl-locul-trei-la-obezitate-in-europa-193494.html ) that we have 50 % overwheight and 25 % obese ( 30 % women , 20 % men , 40 % child obesity ) . 
  [ this 2006 article ] ( http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/obezi-din-copilarie-417711.html ) places the numbers at around 20 % . 
  my folks always complain about how oily the food is in hungary .

  news from luxembourg ? 
  i fuckin love / r/europe !, 
  not in romania ( afaik ) . 
  iirc there were byelections when somebody re-elected mayor somewhere got a spot in parliament , although it very rarely happens , as local and parliamentary elections take place in the same year , so candidate x has time to decide which post they want to run for . 
  i also remember byelections happening when the mayor of cluj got appointed prime-minister in 2008 ( a few month after being re-elected mayor ) . 
  they 're something akin to the international brigades back in the spanish civil war . 
   humans as a species will surely survive for a long time , will western culture ? 
  of course it will . 
  but somebody from the present might not recognize it . 
  i mean , imagine somebody from 200 years ago , from amsterdam , travelling to amsterdam of the year 2013 . 
  or paris . 
   a world changing genius is born pretty rarely and in 95 % of the cases he is born in western civilization . 
  now you 're just pulling statistics out of your ass . 
  well , this was a confusing title ... 
  maybe . 
  maybe not . 
  you really have no way of knowing how history would have unfolded without western civilization , now do you ? 
   without western civilization the world would suck . 
  civilisation is genetic ? 
   do you realize how little achievements there would be without europeans ? 
  without us planet earth would be at least 2000 years back from where we are now . 
  we are the ones responsible for the success of mankind . 
  [ ... ] might sound arrogant but we are awesome . 
  [ ... ] as history has shown western civilization is the engine of humanity . 
  we already know that sooner or later earth will be destroyed . 
  we are the only hope for our entire species and all the species on earth . 
  we are the only ones who can save the planet , or find humanity a new place to continue . 
  [ ... ] we deserve to live and we are needed by everyone even if they ca n't realize it yet . 
  wow ... just wow !, 
  you make it sound as if without us , the earths core would stop spinning . 
  western civilization is cool and all , but come on . 
  we are not the warm little center of the universe . 
   look at what 's happening in africa , the middle east . 
  east asia ...  they are still incapable of doing what we did thousands of years ago . 
  we 're their only hope . 
  well this reminds me of [ a poem ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/the_white_man%27s_burden ), 
   and cross-religion marriages are quite frequent in france , at least more frequent than in the uk . 
  any source for the statistics . 
  ( not doubting , just interested on the topic ), 
  there was [ this paper ] ( http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol19/16/19-16.pdf ) over at / r/natalism but i have n't gotten around to reading it . 
  maybe you 'll find something relevant in there . 
   `` french '' of extra-european background , or immigrants , have more children on average than the euro-french women . 
  yet still the white french have more than other native europeans and the difference between immigrants and natives is relatively low . 
  which is very interesting . 
   why does it say french women , why not `` women living in france '' ? 
  because maybe the article talks about `` french citizens '' , not `` residents of france '' . 
  and female citizens of france are `` french women '' . 
  relevant : [ photovoltaic solar electricity potential in european countries ] ( http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/cmaps/eu_opt/pvgis_europe-solar_opt_publication.png ) [ photovoltaic solar resourse comparison between the us , spain and germany ] ( http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/us_germany_spain/pvmap_usgermanyspain%20poster-01.jpg ), 
  in germany , nazi symbolism is not banned when used for educational purposes . 
   the latvian part and the russian part watch different tv channels , have different newspapers , follow different news , go to different schools , etc. 
  [ ... ] it 's not like there was any hostility between them , they worked together when required and all , but they would not hang out together . 
  i 'd say the same is true * to some degree * with the hungarians and romanians in western romania . 
  i 'd say it partially has to do with language , more than ethnicity per se . 
  i prefer [ the other one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ydrtner_5m ), 
  lithuania ? 
  * ( i 'd like to point out we have a fine selection of flairs , in case you fancy such accessories ) *, 
   at the vatican , zhu took in the full scale of st. peter 's square . 
  `` pretty impressive ! '' he said . 
  `` their pope can just stick his head out anytime he wants and watch all of us down here ? 
  i bet he does n't get any happier than that . '' the scale reminded him of beijing . 
  `` it 's just like the old days , when chinese people used to go to beijing just to catch a glimpse of the communist party . '' he laughed . 
  beautiful !, 
   czech republic or ` czechia ', 
   in the past 20 years , however , the number of provinces has increased , with a duplication of structures ( electoral bodies , presidents , staffs , etc. ), 
  that many perceive as impossible to afford with today 's budget constrains . 
  why not just move up and centralize some of the attributes of the lower administrative division ? 
  keep the provinces , but strip them of some powers . 
  than you can have all the localism you want without necessarily the bureaucracy . 
   mark twain , whose 1867 trip to europe and the eastern mediterranean produced `` the innocents abroad , '' described american tourists `` who talked very loudly and coarsely , and laughed boisterously when all others were so quiet and well behaved . '' i guess some things never change , 
  their flag is basically ` romania + their coa ' microstate .
