  sandwitched between spain and france up in the pyrenees . 
  head of state from spain and france ( some bishop of urquel ? 
  and le president de la republique ) . 
   the government then announced a constitutional reform to reduce the number of provinces . 
  interesting . 
  how do people feel about this ? 
   a priest near venice has hired some bouncers to keep some articularly insistent rom beggars from harassing churchgoers did i understand the article correctly . 
  is the `` bouncer '' romanian-speaking as well ? 
  beggars outside churches during/after service is pretty much standard in romania btw , although they seem to be more insistent at weddings and such , less so at average sunday services . 
  interesting . 
  thanks . 
  going to take a look . 
  do they work ? 
  how are family names in gibraltar ? 
  mostly of anglo-saxon origin , mostly of romance ( iberian ) origin , some other way ? 
   the reality is that `` officially '' , spain does n't recognise gibraltar 's territorial waters why is * officially * between quotation marks . 
  it confuses me a bit . 
   with the rape cases alone he would n't serve a long time how much are we looking at ? 
   but if it turns out to be plans of terrorism , he 'll serve a lot longer same question as above , 
  ** romania ** * exams for those finishing 12th grade ( baccalaureate ) . 
  [ fraud scandal at a bucharest highschool ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romania-starts-baccalaureate-exams-with-fraud-suspicions-at-bucharest-high-school-teachers-fired-taken-into-custody/102994/ ) . 
  even bigger scandal erupted when the police came to the school to pick kids up for questioning while parents were waiting outside ( kids were taking the exam ) . 
  parents got angry , and it all evolved - beside the fraud scandal itself - into a national scandal about how the police handled the situation . 
  * [ census final results ] ( http://actmedia.eu/daily/final-results-of-the-population-and-housing-census-romania-had-over-20-121-million-inhabitants-in-october-2011/46970 ) . 
  we 're more ( 20 mil . ), 
  then the preliminary results had shown ( 19 mil . 
  ) , but still 1.5 mil . 
  less then a decade ago ( stable population ) . 
  also , the new results show that the [ the 2012 referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_presidential_impeachment_referendum,_2012 ) to impeach romania 's president traian b\u0103sescu [ had de facto reached its needed threshold of 50 percent ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-pm-latest-census-data-show-needed-turnout-for-presidential-impeachment-referendum-was-reached-in-2012/103274/ ) . 
  * [ romanian ex-pm radu vasile dies ] ( http://www.edmontonjournal.com/health/romanian+expm+radu+vasile+paved+romanias+entry+invited+pope/8610419/story.html ) . 
  he paved our entry into eu and invited pope john paul ii to romania * 33 syrians ( +2 turkish `` mules '' ) [ caught by the coast guard ] ( http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/middle-east/2013/jul-07/222811-33-syrians-fleeing-to-europe-held-in-romania.ashx ) . 
  biggest such catch on the seas . 
  up-voted because it 's a discussion worth having . 
  how would one go about encouraging native birthrates ? 
  [ they studied declining birthrates ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/97facts/edu2birt.htm ) in the us :  a women 's educational level is the best predictor of how many children she will have , according to a new study [ ... ] . 
  the study , based on an analysis of 1994 birth certificates , found a direct relationship between years of education and birth rates , with the highest birth rates among women with the lowest educational attainment . 
  iirc other factors do n't correlate nearly as well . 
  so either we educate our immigrants , or de-educate our native population . 
  or both . 
  oh no you did n't !, 
   i 'd accept if you had experienced both cultures . 
  that 's why i phrased it as a question . 
  problem is the two things that always get mentioned is language and bullfighting . 
  i 'm really curious about : 1 . 
  what other ( important or less important ) cultural differences do you have ? 
  how much of this is shared with valencia 3 . 
  why you think valencians do n't perceive this cultural rift ? 
  i 'm genuinely curios and looking to get educated . 
  thank you . 
  i ask because catalans always invoke the \u201e our culture is very different from the rest of spain and that 's why we want to separate '' . 
  now if valencians are very much like catalonians ( which i suspected is true ) they should also be up in arms against the foreign culture of castilia . 
  i tend to get very suspecious when people invoke big cultural differences like this . 
  i live on one of europe 's big cultural faultlines ( hell , it runs through my family ) so i get a little skeptical about this argument about how much catalan and castilians are * soooo * different . 
  ( not that i 'm against catalan independence ), 
  not me . 
  see link nr . 
  is valencia closer culturally to castilian spain than to catalonia ? 
  if more power is given to brussels ( more united europe ) it does n't matter as much if countries inside the union merge or fragment . 
   everything i say is factual no it 's not . 
  you define british as \u201e inhabitant of the british isles '' , which is contrary to how the overwhelming majority of english speakers use the word , which is : http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/british  plural in construction : the people of great britain or the commonwealth of nations i would ad that it is often used for all the inhabitants of the uk , but extremely rarely , if ever , for the rep. of ireland . 
  what your argument makes use of is fallacy called [ etymological fallacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymological_fallacy ) . 
  meaning of words is determined by usage , not by etymology . 
  i also remember a story about macedonia considering changing from cet to eet . 
  ca n't find it in english and no speaky macedonian . 
  i live 10 km from the cet-eet limit . 
  i travel forwards and backwards in time quite often . 
  wikilink : [ voronoi diagram ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voronoi ) source : [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1hjh3t/voronoi_diagram_of_every_world_capital/caux41o ) inb4 : luxemburg missing :(, 
  i think the gist of the question was \u201e how much do you feel european compared to feeling swedish/romanian/spanish / whatever '', 
   we were taught very little history of our neighboring nations at school . 
  romanians as well . 
  and this really annoys me . 
  except us :(, 
  wow . 
  12 abstentions ? 
  well , i guess it 's still better than poland . 
  at least we did n't vote against ( except that one guy ) ... 
    trough the history serbia ( territory ) is `` climbing '' up to the north . 
   source ? 
  i think he refers to this : [ great serb migrations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_serb_migrations ), 
   i guess the nationalist movement did n't reach the timok valley , so the people there continued to call themsevles vlachs . 
  that 's my theory as well . 
  identifying with the serb state is similar to how some hungarian-speaking csagos in eastern romania identify as romanians , because they were outside greater hungary and the influence of the nationalist movement . 
  ** romania ** : romanian/english/french bonus : [ a page with old romanian passports ] ( http://gmic.co.uk/index.php/topic/29170-old-romanian-passport/ ) ( interbellum had romanian and french ), 
   i am not aware that anyone methodically asked them how they feel about it . 
  well , if they do n't answer `` romanian '' they 've obviously been brainwashed ( de-nationalised ) by the serb state . 
  * ( this is the line of reasoning romanian nationalists would probably use ) *, 
  orthodox version of the yugoslavs had a big and stronk state in medieval times . 
  got fucked over at kosovo field . 
  had a fetish with the place ever since . 
  got fucked over in ww2 . 
  milosevic had popular support . 
  fucked other states over in the 90s . 
  they seem to be getting their shit together . 
  they have one good autonomous region ( vojvodina , with hungarians and other minorities ) . 
  they * had * one bad autonomous region ( kosovo , with albanians ) . 
  they have 2 kinds of romanians . 
  `` romanians '' in vojvodina and '' [ vlachs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timok_vlachs ) '' in timok valley , serbia proper . 
  there is some friction between romania and serbia regarding the later group . 
  such is reddit ... 
  that 's why new europe is now even more pro-us .
