  it 's via [ romanian ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/pl%c4%83cint%c4%83/505029 ) . 
  even the [ hungarians admit it ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=&amp;qsearch=palacsinta&amp;qdetail=8294 ) , 
  very interesting . 
  civility is one of the things required for a `` minimum standard of education '' . 
   but your statements are off at many points and he has a right to point it out . 
  the thing is that these threads are about outsider 's perspective on different countries . 
  i gave my outsider perspective , and when prompted to expand i did so in good faith . 
  i had no ill intentions . 
  also , some points he pointed out were things * he * misunderstood . 
  but that did n't stop him from going `` your comment is ignorant '' . 
  i 'm less likely to consider someone 's feelings when he comes at me like this . 
   that 's why we do n't like people on the outside making comments about it that are not that founded on extensive knowledge . 
  there are other , more effective strategies to cope with outsider 's perspectives than insult and drama . 
  i assume this is a forum for dialog and exchange of points of view . 
   its the reason i do n't run ahead of myself and talk about romania and hungary and your history . 
  when the `` what do you know about romania ? '', 
  thread comes up i expect you to talk about it . 
  rest assure i will be neither offended nor will i start calling people 's comments ignorant . 
   but it 's lazy in the same way as calling the scots english actually , i 'd say the analogy is calling scots british , after the uk got dismembered through a civil war . 
  scots , english , welsh are like croat , serb and bosniaks . 
  british and yugoslav are a sort of superidentity . 
  so is scandinavian . 
  or maybe irish , since they do n't like being lumped together with the brits , although being quite british in a sense . 
  i really meant no offence , but it is a way of seeing croatia for people here . 
  a lot of people still talk about `` yugoslavs '' when refering to `` western balkan slavs '' . 
  also keep in mind that unlike croat , serb and bosnian nationalisms , a lot of other national identities focus around a language , so many people assume that if 3 groups speak the same language they are 3 flavors of the same people ( i know it 's not the case ) . 
  i know . 
  i 'm quite fascinated about how western south slavic dialects have totally different boundaries than western south slavic peoples . 
  awesome !, 
  glad to hear it !, 
   ah , so you wo n't mind if i call you a vlacho-moldavian then ? 
  not really . 
  it would be quite childish of me . 
   this kind of scornful dismissal of national , cultural and language identities the only thing i 'm dismissing your oversensitivity . 
  fun fact : `` plachenka '' comes from romanian '' [ placint\u0103 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/placinta ) '' which in turn comes from the latin `` placenta '', 
   it does n't `` seem '' offensive , it is offensive . 
  offensiveness is subjective . 
   denying people the common courtesy to call them and their language what they want to be called ? 
  i never denied anyone anything . 
  get over yourself . 
   why do n't you call czhecs and slovaks `` czecho-slovaks '' ? 
  some people actually still use the word . 
  i 'm sure czekoslovaks are raging in anger . 
   how about them swedo-dano-norwegio-icelanders huh ? 
  yeah . 
  they go batshit insane when we call them `` scandinavians '' !, 
   or them brito-americo-austalians ? 
  `` anglo-saxon countries '' or `` anglophone countries '' make even the most peaceful new zealander break out into a war hakka . 
  i was stating something that is an outside perception , not a scientific fact regarding the existence of a `` yugoslav ethnicity '' . 
  `` yugoslav '' was a convenient way to name the shtokavian speakers , instead of `` serb-croat-bosniac-and-co '' . 
  i know few people identified with the ethnicity of `` yugoslav '' , and even fewer identify today . 
  i also know that nationalists get all offended about being lumped together with serbs and bosniaks , but i care little for nationalist sensibilities . 
  they find many trivial things to be offensive . 
  just like religious fanatics . 
   i ca n't shake the feeling that those that continue to insist on this meaningless conflation of languages are really outright collectivists with dangerous totalitarian tendencies . 
   ) i like you . 
  as reward for making me laugh , i 'll send you to the gulag later rather than sooner . 
  a bit of it is to the west ( technically , the urals stop north-west of kazakhstan ), 
   in 50 years of divergent development croatian and serbian will be as far apart as norwegian and swedish , possibly more . 
  i doubt it . 
  norwegian and swedish have centuries of divergent evolution . 
  serbian and croatian way less . 
   croatia has both and therefore can claim croatian as a distinct language they can claim it , but i 'm sure linguists will say serbian and croatian are a different standardised registers of the same language ( shtokavian ) than two different languages . 
  like hindi and urdu are for [ hindustani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hindustani_language ) . 
  by `` yugoslavs '' i mean the serbo-croatian speakers . 
  serbs are the ortodox version of the bunch , bosniaks are the muslims and the croats are the catholic version . 
  i know the `` yugoslavs '' include slovenians and macedonians , but the serbo-croatians were the `` core '' . 
  catholic version of the yugoslavs beaches and islands . 
  [ plitvice lakes look awesome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plitvice_lakes ) they have city whose name means [ penis in romanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pula ) . 
  hence , romanian tourists traditionally take pictures with the sign at the city entrance . 
  istria has remnants of [ an interesting branch of romanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istro-romanians ) . 
  sadly , they are facing assimilation and language death . 
  the adriatic coast has some fucked up winds . 
  i forgot the name but they are so strong , that for the few days they blow people just stay indoor . 
  some kind of union with medieval hungary . 
  the dialect near the capital is very different from standard croatian . 
   the southern part of our nation introduced a new logo got curious so i googled it .

  thank you . 
  [ source ] ( http://insideurope.eu/node/403 ), 
   borrowed french words constitute about 40 % of the romanian language . 
  actually , the 40 % is not just french but a mix of french ( 22 % ) , borrowed latin ( 15 % ) and italian ( 4 % ) , as per [ this chart ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/cuvintelelimbiiromane.svg/474px-cuvintelelimbiiromane.svg.png ) . 
   first , you made an error in misleading people with your `` old maps '' link . 
   that 1st image that pops as the `` old map '' on wikipedia is not the old map . 
   this is the real `` old map '' of the ancient kingdom of macedonia [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:expansionofmacedon.jpg you misunderstood what i said . 
  i did n't mean `` maps of old macedonia '' . 
  i meant `` old maps '' as in maps made in the lat 19th - early 20th century about that region of the balkans ( `` ottoman rule '' section and below ) . 
  you 'll notice that cartographers refer to the slavic populations of the current ( fyro ) macedonia as either `` serbs '' , `` bulgarians '' or `` macedonian slavs ''  the area now known as `` macedonia '' was never ever part of the ancient macedonian kingdom . 
  it was a `` dependent territory '' but never in the kingdom itself . 
  never said it was , and for the purpose of the current discussion , it 's irrelevant . 
  you 'll notice that i did not bring up ancient macedonia . 
   the people who call themselves `` macedonian '' today ( mostly bulgarian refugees ) appeared in that area sometime between 500-1000 years after alexander the great had died and the macedonian empire had vanished .
