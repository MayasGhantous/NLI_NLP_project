  partially . 
  not all of the inhabitants are descended from slav migrants . 
  some are assimilated locals . 
  but again , this is sort of irrelevant for the present discussion . 
  same in romania . 
   to what extent is/was romanian culture influenced by balkan culture ? 
  to a huge extent . 
  linguistically we are latin ( with a healthy dose of slavic and some turkic elements ) , but everything else ( culture is way more than language ) is influenced by neighboring slavic-greek-turkic-balkan-orthodox-whatever elements . 
  we like to exagerate our latin-ness and downplay balkan and slavic elements , because latin-ness and by extention , western-ness , are more prestigious , than eastern-european-ness . 
   does contemporary balkan pop music bleed into romanian pop at all ? 
  regarding linguistic similarities : gaelic irish and english belong to two different branches of the indo-european ( celtic and italic ) , while the dialects spoken by moldovans and romanians belong to the same branch ( italic ) and even the same sub-branch ( eastern romance ) . 
  so comparing manchaster vs london english is more close to reality . 
  maybe using hiberno-english ( maybe dublin ) vs london english would have been even more accurate , but irish-gaelic is in no way a good comparison regarding cultural simmilarities , i 'd rather not say , but i do n't think that dublin vs london is very of in this regard either to be honest . 
  now identities are highly personal , so how close someone * feels * they are to somebody else is at times very subjective and ideology-dependent . 
  i wonder why the rotor blades are at that angle . 
  looks a bit unusual . 
  is the angle adjustable ? 
  [ here you go ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/controversy_over_linguistic_and_ethnic_identity_in_moldova ), 
   but can we really say that macedonian is just a `` dialect '' of bulgarian or serbian ? 
  are the languages truly mutually intelligible ? 
  macedonian belongs to the eastern group of south slavic languages and is very close to dialects of western bulgaria ( standard bulgarian is based on eastern dialects ) . 
  now , whether macedonian is a dialect of bulgarian or a separate language is more of a political than linguistic question ( '' [ a language is a dialect with an army and a navy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy ) '' as the saying goes ) . 
  now the whole south-slavic linguistic continuum is weird in a sense . 
  there are more differences between '' [ croatian dialects ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/croatian_dialects.png ) '' than between `` standard serbian '' and `` standard croatian '' ( both based on the shtokavian dialect , and virtually the same language ) . 
  so if macedonians would have self identified as serbians , it would n't be very different from croatians ( the area around zagreb speaks the kajkavian dialect , which is quite different to `` standard croatian '' , for example ) . 
   was `` macedonia '' as an idea created by the yugoslav republic from what i 've read , intelectuals from the area had 3 tendencies : to identify as serbs , to identify as bulgarians , or to identify with the regional , `` macedonian '' identity ( see how varied the old maps on [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_macedonia ) are ) . 
  afaik , tito encouraged the 3rd intelectual faction , and helped create a `` macedonian '' identity , although its seeds existed before tito ( late 19th c. ) . 
  so the ideological consolidation of the `` macedonian nation '' happened later than other `` nationalisms '' that 's why many people feel it 's a new thing . 
  see also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_nationalism  similar to how the `` moldovan '' language/identity is about as different from romanian as manchester english is from london ? 
  i would refrain from using the moldovan paralel , as it might bias you to react emotionally to the whole issue . 
  also , language and identity are not always so linked as is the case with romanians . 
  czechs and slovaks , danes , swedes and norwegians speak very simmilar languages , but feel part of different `` nations '' . 
  hell , most serbs , bosniaks and croats speak what one might call `` serbo-croatian '' , but they feel they belong to 3 different nations , regardless of linguistics . 
  a book i highly recommend , regarding nations and nationalism , is benedict anderson 's '' [ imagined communities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imagined_communities ) ''  i also read flame-fanning claims that its not a `` real '' country . 
  well , i 'd say it 's as real as any country recognized by the un . 
  consider submitting the question to / r/askhistorians as well . 
  they are awesome over there .

  i think [ this economist cover ] ( http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/print-cover-full/print-covers/20130223_cna400.jpg ) sums it up pretty well . 
  the images from syria look absolutely apocalyptic http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2012/11/syria.html http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/04/syria-in-ruins/100488/, 
  some people confuse europe with old world christendom, 
  i strongly support turning survey results into maps !, 
  may the gods give you a bountiful harvest this year !, 
  do n't try humor . 
  it only confuses and angers them . 
  once again , this is not a map ... & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; ( might turn it into one - or more - tonight ), 
  what happens in q1 and q3 , when things seem to go better , as opposed to q2 and q4 , when things seem to contract ? 
  fair to a considerable extent . 
  which is not the same as `` unfair '' as you seem to sugest . 
  you 're trying to turn a continuum into a black and white dichotomy .

   albania does n't have these , making an exception and calling them a democracy [ two exceptions ] ( http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2009/06/29/feature-01 ) . 
  but yeah , elections pre-2009 seem to [ fall short on international standards ] ( http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/02/20/nb-01 ) . 
  let 's hope the trend of improvement continues . 
   i do n't believe that there is the will in albania from any quarter to change is this from first-hand experience inside albania ? 
  ( i ask because it sound as such ) . 
   it is n't even a democracy one could argue it is , albeit an imperfect one . 
  they 've had free and `` quite fair '' elections , [ according to the osce ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/osce-says-albania-polls-free-and-quite-fair )  albania is going to enter the eu any time soon define `` anytime soon '' . 
  it 's not like anybody thinks they 'll join this decade . 
  why not ? 
  this is not about a lost province . 
  more like a lost `` brand '' . 
  see flair . 
  yes , those seem to be ethnic roma . 
  yes , those bulgarian citizens are most likely of roma ethnicity . 
   people are really making the effort to teach it to their kids and keep the language going !, 
  they have a load of cultural events etc to maintain it . 
  it really warms my heart to hear this . 
  thank you , 
  i 'm sorry but my first thought was : `` thank god it ai n't us this time ! '', 
  what did you have in mind ? 
  actually , modern greek is \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7 ( pronounced * evr\u00f3pi * ) both the continent and [ the mythical character ] ( http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%95%cf%85%cf%81%cf%8e%cf%80%ce%b7_%28%ce%bc%cf%85%ce%b8%ce%bf%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%b3%ce%af%ce%b1%29 ), 
  not * that * much variation in the name of the continent tbh . 
  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/europe click ** [ show ] ** on the ** continent ** section, 
  i do n't remember where i read it . 
  it might be a bunk etymology . 
  i 'll look tomorrow to see if i find anything . 
   unique language not related to it 's neighbors it 's actually related to the neighbors , only distantly . 
  it 's indo-european after all , but from its own branch . 
   2 ) they still follow old greek orthodox religion apparently , [ it 's a `` byzantine rite catholic '' church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italo-albanian_catholic_church ) , simmilar to greek-catholic churches in romania and ukraine and other places . 
  til . 
   before televsion was introduced , very few people from piana degli albanesi ( or santa cristina gela or the other surrounding arbereshe villages ) could speak italian - hence why the language has been maintained for so long what about now . 
  has television eroded the language ? 
  what 's its status like now ? 
  / u/dngrs is one level above , 
   post a small writeup directing users , who wish to plan a trip to wherever , to that countries specific subreddit or / r/travel in the sidebar or post a previous thread in the sidebar these are not bad suggestions . 
  there is something similar over at / r/romania :  if you 're planning a holiday to ~ ~ romania ~ ~ europe , here are a few threads with some advice : * [ 1 ] ( link1 ) , [ 2 ] ( link2 ) , etc * ... or something similar is a good idea ( i 've been meaning to add some more links to previous threads ) . 
  now judging from experience , you will still have people missing the links on the sidebar and posting questions anyway , so do n't expect these to go away . 
  plus as others have said , they do n't take up that much of a segment of submissions . 
  did n't know about that thread .
