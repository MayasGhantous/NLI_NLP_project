  thanks , 
  basically , [ conspicuous/invidious consumption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspicuous_consumption ), 
  in a similar fashion , i 've heard [ boto\u015fani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/botosani ) being referred to as both * botswana * and * boston * ( the latter by natives ) . 
   national hero is [ 3 ] skanderbeg and for some reason , romanians call arm-wrestling `` skandenberg '' , which i suspect , might be related to the name of the albanian hero . 
   mother theresa born there actually , she was born in what is today ( fyro ) macedonia . 
  but she was , indeed , an ethnic albanian . 
  there are also [ albanians in italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanians_in_italy ) , called arb\u00ebresh\u00eb . 
   after ww2 it had a very strict communist regime oficcially declared the state `` ateistic '' and closed all places of worship . 
  also [ they built a shitload of bunkers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunkers_in_albania ) . 
  like 1 for 4 people . 
  communist paranoia . 
  also , they were allied with china for a while , against the ussr . 
  also tirana is named after teheran . 
  also , albania is the ones romanians can feel superior to . 
  hence albanian jokes such as :  q ) how can you stop a albanian tank ? 
  a ) you shoot the soldier that is pushing it . 
   q ) why is there a rubber-band shortage in albania ? 
  a ) they 're saving it for their satellite launch . 
  the idea has been put out there , but it seems most people like the current semi-presidential system , but do n't like some of the powers the president has . 
  also they distrust the mps and the parliament in general so they are n't that eager to turn the system into a fully parliamentary one . 
  they like the idea of a directly elected president . 
   antonescu , the guy who the `` social-liberals '' want to be the candidate for president , so he 's writing what are going to be his attributions . 
  afaik they want to remove some of the existing powers of the presidency given the bad experience they had with the current president ( basescu ) , not because antonescu `` is lazy '' . 
  regarding the constitutional changes , more info [ in the thread from last week ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ggxig/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/cak6aex?context=3 ) and [ the week before ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fz4ar/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/caf7anx ) . 
  also , a singer ( alexandra stan ) [ was beaten up by her boyfriend/manager ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/beaten-music-star-case-higlights-romania-s-domestic-violence-problems ) and the issue of domestic abuse was a topic of discussion on tv . 
  `` eastern european '' is often used not as a strict geographic name but a historic one , meaning `` former communist europe '' . 
  it was [ an old ottoman currency that circulated in the region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/para_ ( currency \\ ) ) . 
  but `` parai '' is usually used for `` dollars '' , not local currency . 
   lev , on the other hand , comes from the old word for ` lion ' . 
  so does the word for the romanian currency , the `` leu '' . 
  it comes from the name of the dutch [ taler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thaler ) which featured [ a lion on one side ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/loewentaler.jpg ) and circulated in the are in the 17th cenury . 
  it was called loewentaler , meaning `` lion-taler '' and eventually got shortened to `` lion '' . 
  like switzerland ... 
   care to share some examples of regions where ethnic romanians were given independence anywhere ? 
  i do n't understand your question . 
  do you mean  examples of regions where ethnic romanians were given * autonomy * ? 
  meanwhile , in eastern-orthodox europe ... 
   i 'm saying that every person that feels closer to another population or culture is free to go there and live among them . 
  exactly . 
  romanians should have left transylvania if they preferred romania to austria-hungary . 
   i do n't think other cities [ ? ], 
  have a greater say in their `` local '' affairs . 
  nobody says * only * transylvanians should have more say . 
  everybody should have more say . 
   equality . 
  be carefull . 
  there are many ways to define `` equality '' . 
   you 're taking me too seriously . 
  no i 'm not . 
  but maybe you missed the point . 
   and nobody is stopping you at the border . 
  feel free to move there . 
  so what you 're saying is that romanians should have left transylvania 100 years ago instead of asking for a greater say in local affairs ? 
   because romania is a ~ ~ republic ~ ~ * unitary state * not a federation . 
  you 're confusing concepts . 
  the opposite or a * federal state * is a * unitary state * , and the opposite of a * republic * is a * monarchy * . 
   and you 're just perpetuating this kind behavior they have when you give them preferential treatment . 
  no i 'm not perpetuating anything , and i 'm not giving anybody preferential treatment . 
  you think superiority complexes would dissappear just because they would n't have a flair ? 
  i bet other people 's inferiority complex are n't going anywhere , no mater what flag i give them . 
  maybe we should remove national flairs as well . 
   i gladly await my rahova or district 5 flair when you 'll provide an official or historic flag for rahova i 'll gladly make a flair for you . 
   or is transylvania the only historical region worthy of a flair ? 
  flags of regions are given on a request basis . 
  there 's a guy who requested a wallachian flag and received it . 
  next time check your facts . 
   many romanians from transylvania , like myself , feel we have more in common with our western neighbors than with our south-eastern fellow citizens . 
  while i agree that there are some cultural differences between transylvanians and the regat , i 'd say the differences are still bigger between transylvanians and hungarians from hungary . 
   i 've just finished these 13 ( in my case , 14 ) years , and my level of irish is horrible . 
  so why do you think that is ? 
   a flair especially for people with juvenile separatist views oh please . 
  not everyone who supports a regional flair is a separatist . 
  ** romania ** more debates around changing the constitution . 
  [ here is last weeks stuff ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fz4ar/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/caf7anx ) . 
  * so remember the amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman alone , effectively banning gay marriage ? 
  they decided not to include it after all ( apparently last week 's vote was on `` on principle '' . 
  this week 's was the real deal ) . 
  so theoretically , a legalisation of gay marriage wo n't need a constitutional amendment in the future . 
  * otoh , the proposed amendment to forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation got scraped as well . 
  * because we had [ a referendum in 2009 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_parliamentary_reform_referendum,_2009 ) calling for unicameralism and a maximum of 300 mps , which the current coalition is ignoring , the president said he will call a referendum on these issues once more . 
  ( the referendum was non-binding , passed with a wide margin - over 75 % for - but was seen as a populist move made by the president , as he called it at the same time as the presidential elections , to take advantage of anti-parliament sentiment ) * together with bulgaria we opened [ a new bridge across the danube ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gc3am/thank_you_eu_new_bridge_opening_on_river_danube/ ), 
  not that [ big of a detour ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ncle2to.png ) . 
  sure , serbia has better highways , but once bulgaria and romania join schengen , you 'll have a smooth ride from the turkish border all the way to westernmost europe . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolin  wolin ( german : wollin , pomeranian w\u00f2lin ) is the name both of an island in the baltic sea , just off the polish coast , and a town on that island . 
  ( for the non-polish ), 
  maybe rate of city to rural population might correlate somewhat . 
  also i see a north to south drop . 
  more visible on the map : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g9y8s/number_of_police_officers_per_100_000_inhabitants/caiab7b, 
  inkscape and [ this map ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:nuts_1_regions_eu-27.svg ) from wikimedia commons . 
  thank you , 
  here 's a [ map for europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlcbzxx.png ) . 
  i used the data above , plus some [ data found on wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_police_officers ) ( the ones in * italic ** ) . 
  the cyprus data does not include the north , and i assumed the serbian data excludes kosovo . 
  if anybody finds anything about albania , bosnia , moldova , ukraine , belarus , as well as georgia , armenia and azerbaidjan , i will update/expand the map . 
  exactly what i thought ... 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_language#standard_albanian  standard albanian is based on the tosk dialect . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheg_albanian  gheg ( or geg ) is one of the two major varieties of albanian language . 
  the other one is tosk , on which standard albanian is based . 
  [ ... ] gheg is spoken in northern albania , kosovo , northwestern republic of macedonia , southern montenegro and serbia . 
  [ ... ] gheg does not have any official status as a written language in any country .
