  publications in kosovo and macedonia are in standard albanian , which is based on tosk . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_geg  southern gheg is one of the two dialects of gheg albanian , along with northern gheg . 
  southern gheg is the gheg dialect with the least differences from tosk . 
  it can be divided further into central gheg , which is the dialect spoken by the majority of the albanians in macedonia , and middle gheg , which is spoken in the central regions of albania including the country 's capital , tiran\u00eb . 
  ** [ relevant map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/albanian_dialects.svg/500px-albanian_dialects.svg.png ) ** also , try asking over at / r/albania and/or / r/linguistics, 
  you were talking about how `` such [ universal human ] rights should be granted to anyone [ and ] they should n't be questioned but supported '' or did i read that incorrectly ? 
  i 'd say the ** \u2661 ** at the end kinda served as that . 
  so as soon as a girl gets her first period , we should consider her an adult ( adolescent is a rather modern concept ) , like in the old days . 
  40 year old men marrying 12 year olds would not be paedophilia , and entirely ok . 
  because serbia stronk !, 
   it seems some people have different ideas of human rights and dignity then . 
  i 'd say that is rather obvious . 
   they should n't be questioned everything should be questioned . 
  skepticism is healthy . 
  ups . 
  thank you . 
  fixed it . 
  interwar ( landlocked ) hungary was lead by * admiral * horthy [ relevant joke ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1efnng/19_arabicspeaking_redditors_decided_to_record_the/ca0jjl0 ) *, 
  no idea what the name was, 
  belarus, 
  yeah , the asian ones . 
  ( although i do n't remember them `` swimming '' in sauce ) we bought them at the tram stop between the natural history museum and the parliament . 
  i think we bought in another place as well , but they were the same kind of shop . 
  done, 
   the italian provinces of bolzano , trento , trieste and gorizia still use the austrian land register system , that differs from the one used in the rest of italy . 
  same with romania . 
  transylvanians like to pride themselves with the things the austrians brought and look at [ regat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regat ) romanians as more balkan and more backwards ( i 'm guessing something simmilar as italians do with sicilians and other southerners ) . 
  you know , the usual `` they are implementing the land registry now while * we * had it since maria theresa '' . 
   my ancestors were subjects of the austrian empire , my great-grandfather ( an ethnic italian from istria ) fought for austria 's kuk kriegsmarine during wwi , he was a sailor on the `` herzherzog franz ferdinand '' i have an ancestor who was from udine , then lobardy-venetia . 
  worked as a stone-mason in eastern transylvania . 
  former empire , current neutral state . 
  non-german germans . 
  vienna is a very nice city . 
  did a crazy new years celebration there . 
  visited cool museums . 
  awesome noodles found on street-shops ( i miss those ) . 
  thank you for this . 
  interesting . 
  i know there are solid reasons not to fear floods in our area . 
  but still , we both know that perfectly predictable weather ( such as snow ... in winter ) catches out politicians \u201e off guard '' . 
   also i did n't know romania wants to join the visegrad group . 
  that 's news to me too . 
   two amendments in the constitution following the ec 's recommendations . 
  details ? 
  i think he was referring to copying poland regarding its model of regionalisation . 
  we have the lowest rate of eu fund absorption and poland has a very good rate ( afaik ) and the way it did its regionalisation is seen as an important factor . 
  also he said he wants to copy the way poland is dtrong on the international level . 
  not much mention of social issues . 
  so silesians and kashubians are n't considered ethnic minorities ? 
   a man forgot his 2-year old son in his car and went to work . 
  the child died because of the heat . 
  reminds me of a pulizer-prize winning article : * ** [ fatal distraction ] ( http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2010-feature-writing ) ** - forgetting a child in the back seat of a hot , parked car is a horrifying , inexcusable mistake . 
  but is it a crime ? 
  let the reader beware !, 
  this is extremely strong stuff emotionally !, 
   copying hungary i see ? 
  that 's what it reminded me as well . 
  did n't they put something about god and christianity in the preamble as well ? 
   anything about the szekely autonomy ? 
  nope . 
  the exact number/shape of the regions will probably be defined by normal law . 
  but i do n't think the szeklers will get an autonomous region . 
  they will most likely used the current [ development regions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/development_regions_of_romania ) . 
   it 's surprising for me cause i thought the liberals were in charge in romania ? 
  well our liberals are conservative-liberals , closer to fidesz than to lib-dems . 
  also , the social-democrats have a lot of rural and elderly voters , so they ca n't really be pro-gays , although ponta said that he does n't think the definition of marriage should be changed via the constitution . 
   right now it 's 18 national minorities , who 's going to lose it ? 
  i might be wrong . 
  ca n't find the number 17 in the press , but i remember hearing it on the radio . 
   also that 's pretty impressive , there 's only one , or two guaranteed seats in polish sejm for german minority and you guys have 18 plus udmr as well . 
  thank you . 
  so why does only the german minority get guaranteed seat ? 
  i felt that using the future tense was enough for people to realize that it 's not adopted yet , but now that you mention it , maybe i should have made it more explicit . 
  what i wanted to do but forgot was link to [ last week 's thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fij5q/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/caalomp ), 
   state agencies are about to be surprised by danube flooding . 
  i know the feel . 
  we 've been joking about this as well . 
  ** romania ** a lot of debate on constitutional reforms * [ an amendment to romania 's new constitution , defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman alone , effectively banning gay marriage ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-takes-a-negative-stand-to-same-sex-marriage ) ( civil unions might still be possible . ), 
  * otoh [ discrimination based on sexual orientation will be forbidden in the new constitution ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/sexual-orientation-discrimination-forbidden-in-romania-by-the-new-constitution/101026/ ) * [ we 're also gon na change the flag by putting the coa on it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1fnjpg/comity_in_charge_of_amending_the_romanian/ ) * the proposition to make \u201e [ nihil sine deo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nihil_sine_deo ) '' the state motto was rejected . 
  * although the comission rejected a very pro-church midification to the article regarding religious denominations , the text will probably be included in the new preamble of the constitution . 
  the text will probably be something like :  * the romanian state respects the beliefs of the eminently religious romanian people and recognizes the important role of the romanian orthodox church and other recognized churches and denominations in the national history of romania and of the romanian society . 
  * [ other changes ] ( http://www.gandul.info/politica/revizuirea-constitutiei-camera-deputatilor-va-avea-300-de-membri-10933389 ) ( less talked about ) : * the chamber of deputies will have 300 members plus the 17 ( * or 18 * ) for national minorities ( 1 for each ) . 
  * the term of the president will be shortened to 4 years from 5 ( it was lengthened in 2003 and it 's viewed as a bad decision ) . 
  * new parliamentary groups can not be formed after elections , but migration of individual mps from one party to another is still possible . 
  * the concept of \u201e regions '' has been introduced , besides the existing counties and communes . 
  yeah , austria , since the turks were stopped at vienna ( large parts of hungary were conquered as well ) , but everybody in the balkans think that they had the most important role . 
  there is no logic ... 
  the semitic language , the population is greater than iceland 's , 3 islands , christians . 
  also i heard the marble-work in their main ( co - ) cathedral is crazy-awesome . 
  also , a nazi bomb fell through the dome during mass , but did n't explode . 
  there was a youtube vid ( got taken down ) of a maltese and a tunisian speaking to each other in their respective languages ( maltese and tunisian vernacular arabic ) . 
  i was mostly referring to the title with my comment . 
  there is distinction between `` last * ever * '' and `` last * native ''  latin is dead , sanskrit is dead not really . 
  we just do n't call them by that name any more ( [ except these guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ladin_language ) ) . 
  there was no `` last native speaker of latin '' or `` last native speaker of sanskrit '' . 
  last * native * speaker . 
  there are still people who speak it as a second language , so the language is not entirely dead yet . 
  just moribund . 
  see [ this / r/linguistics thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1fpyqa/last_ever_speaker_of_livonian_passes_away_aged_103/cacp5fx ) for more . 
  also , this reminds me of [ tevfik esen\u00e7 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tevfik_esen%c3%a7 ) .
