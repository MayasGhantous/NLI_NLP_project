  his gravestone reads :  * this is the grave of tevfik esen\u00e7 . 
  he was the last person able to speak the language they called ubykh . 
  man wait many years for be free from politburo .

  we really need new names for these ... 
  my first thought : \u201e 66 is not that bad ... '' 2nd thought : \u201e above italy ? 
  as somebody pointed out , it was the chp who was in power when northern cyprus was invaded , so i would n't call it totally unrelated . 
  anyway , threads derail from the main subject on / r/europe all the time . 
   and the guy was immune ** because he was a friend of the mods . 
  ** you got told no such thing . 
  please stop putting words in other people 's mouths . 
   why does it matter ? 
  because if you want to get a message across , it matters how you phrase it . 
   the turks * a * turk  most people are n't aware of turkey 's imperial pursuits on cyprus i think most people on / r/europe are aware of the north cyprus issue , as it is raised fairly often . 
   i felt it was helpful to point out the irony . 
  i think doing so in a less arrogant manner would have been more productive . 
  the chp 's democratic credentials are a good point to discuss , but your tone left little room for goodwill . 
   a vocal and aggressive minority that want to see latvia becoming a province of russia . 
  just a curiosity . 
  have there been any opinion polls about how many of the russians in latvia would want it to be annexed by russia ? 
  or anything about the pro-russian-ness of the russian minority . 
   is still has n't become obvious that it has been hijacked by islamists . 
  this is a mongolian twist on the overused `` if it was n't for us , europe would have been turkish/muslim now '' used by pretty much everybody in the balkans, 
   the trolls who come into totally unrelated threads and bring up cyprus are n't interested in being educated or earnest debate . 
  and calling them names is constructive how ? 
  as with anything \u201e hungarian '' it 's found in all the lands that made up greater hungary . 
  that one moldavian prince wrote a history of the ottoman empire and a history of ottoman court music with notations that survived until today . 
   in french , there 's an expression to describe someone who is physically strong , `` fort comme un turc '' , which means `` strong like a turk '' . 
  there are some expressions in romanian : \u201e a fuma ca un turc '' - to smoke like a turkc , i.e. 
  a lot \u201e a fi turc '' - to be turkish i.e. 
  to not understand what somebody says , mainy in the phrase \u201e nu \u00een\u021belegi , e\u0219ti turc ? '' \u201e do n't you understand ? 
  what are you , a turk ? '' \u201e cum e turcul , \u0219i pistolul '' - \u201e as is the turk , so is the pistol '' i.e. 
  as is the man , so are his actions/his friends ( something akin to \u201e as is one , so is the other '' ), 
  true . 
  for example less then half of hungarian vocabulary is fino-ugric . 
  it was n't me who started the cyprus debate . 
  if you want to engage in it - which you seem to do , since you could n't let it go - try doing it in a civil manner . 
  that was the point of my comment . 
   i do have an actual informative post in that pile of posts though . 
  true , and i 'm actually sorry that it got downvoted . 
   who said we wanted to debate about cyprus on a post concerning a dramatic event in istanbul ? 
  then do n't . 
   do you bring up nazism everytime someone posts about germany ? 
  did you see me bring up cyprus ? 
  congratulation to users / u/salvaxe , / u/sosolidclaws and / u/thorzaim who instead of taking their opportunity to actually engage in a civil discussion regarding turkish politics and the cyprus question resorted to childish name-calling and arrogance . 
   i 'm guessing that autonomy from ottoman rule is what kept the romanian language a romance one . 
  not necessarily . 
  also , about a third of romanians were not under ottoman rule , but hungarian rule ( even when transylvania was under indirect ottoman rule , the local elites were still largely hungarian ), 
  thank you , but i 'm not really sure how this works and what to do ? 
  sure , no problem   + / u/bitcointip 0,10 $ verify what is this ? 
  well , this week seems to have been a bit gruesome for italy ... 
  well , [ the law ] ( http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/3_2000.php ) ( did n't find it in english ) states that you can have national referendums concerning : 1 . 
  * changing the constitution * 2 . 
  * impeaching the president * 3 . 
  * things of national interest * such as : * reform measures and the country 's economic strategy * particular policy decisions on : * a ) general scheme of public and private property ; * b ) the organization of local government , territory , and the general scheme of local autonomy ; * c ) general organization of education ; * d ) the structure of the national defense system , military organization , armed forces participation in some international operations ; * e ) completion , signing and ratification of international documents for an indefinite period or for a period exceeding 10 years ; * f ) integration of romania into the eu and nato ; * g ) general regime of religious denominations . 
  or/and on local level for * * unusual/special matters * you can not put on a referendum things that the [ constitution forbids ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=7 ) through article 152 :  ( 1 ) the provisions of this constitution with regard to the national , independent , unitary and indivisible character of the romanian state , the republican form of government , territorial integrity , independence of justice , political pluralism and official language shall not be subject to revision . 
   ( 2 ) likewise , no revision shall be made if it results in the suppression of the citizens ' fundamental rights and freedoms , or of the safeguards thereof . 
   ( 3 ) the constitution shall not be revised during a state of siege or emergency , or in wartime . 
  i wonder if that which he refers to take into account donations made on the local level , or just the ones made on the national level . 
  for other readers , the section he refers to is ( rough g!translate ) :  state secretary for religious denominations :  [ ... ] * if you access our site , the romanian orthodox church is the main beneficiary financially support the romanian state . 
  but we do not encounter here a form of discrimination , and i 'll tell you why . 
  the explanation is encountered in the same piece of legislation , which invokes the principle of proportionality . 
  in other words , the romanian orthodox church receives more funding from the state just because it has the largest number of believers , as the census shows . 
  virtually all religions receive state funds based on the number of followers . 
  *  * the law also adds an important nuance . 
  besides the criterion of the number of believers , it also adds the \u201e real needs of the denominations '' criterion . 
  so it take into account not only the number of believers , but also those related to the specific needs of each denomination , who understands how to manage its relationship with their faithful . 
  therefore the proportion of funding does not to reproduce exactly the census . 
  sorry , ich sprache no deutsch . 
  oh , ok . just wanted to make sure . 
   but germany has not is sad . 
  so how do you organize referendums . 
  or do n't you ? 
  well , what are the consequences of him being russian ? 
  how does it affect you that the mayor of the capital is russian , while the majority of latvia is latvian . 
  does he get votes from ethnic latvians . 
  how many more cities have russian mayors . 
  things like this . 
  could you expand a bit on the politics . 
  i see the mayor of riga has been a russian since 2009 . 
   i sincerely hope the referendum law remains at 50 % + 1 votes the thing is up until now , for a referendum to be valid , it had to have a minimum 50 % turnout of registered voters for it to be binding . 
  case in point : last summer , there was a vote to impeach the president . 
  the pro-impeachment vote got something like 80 % of votes , but less then 50 % of registered voters showed up ( the anti-impeachment side boycotted it ) , therefore the referendum was not binding . 
  now only 30 % of registered voters need to show up for it too be binding . 
  to add to / u/onerichbastard 's comment regarding the secular nature of the state . 
  the constitution does not define the relationship between church and state but law no . 
  486/2006 regarding religious freedom states that :  ** art . 
  9 ** -- ( 1 ) there is no state religion in romania ; the state is neutral towards any religious persuasion or atheistic ideology . 
   ( 2 ) the denominations are equal before the law and public authorities . 
  the state , though its authorities , shall neither promote nor support the granting of privileges or the instatement of discrimination towards any denomination . 
   ( 3 ) public authorities shall cooperate with the denominations in matters of common interest and shall support their activity . 
   ( 4 ) the romanian state , though its jurisdictional public authorities , shall support spiritual-cultural and social activities carried out in other countries by denominations recognized in romania . 
   ( 5 ) the central public authorities may sign partnerships with recognized denominations , in domains of common interests , as well as agreements for regulating certain aspects specific to the tradition of denominations , which agreements shall be submitted to approval by law . 
   ** art . 
  10 ** -- ( 1 ) expenditures for maintaining denominations and for their activities shall be financed primarily form their own income , as created and managed under their bylaws .
