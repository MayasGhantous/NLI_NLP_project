   ( 2 ) the denominations may set contributions from their worshipers in order to support their activities . 
   ( 3 ) the state shall promote citizen support for denominations through tax exemptions , and shall encourage sponsorship of denominations , under the law . 
   ( 4 ) on request , the state shall support the pay funds for the clergy and non-clergy staff of recognized denominations through contributions , based on the number of their worshipers who are romanian citizens and based on their genuine needs of subsistence and activity . 
  the state shall grant higher contributions for the pay fund of denomination employees to denomination units that have a low income , under the law . 
   ( 5 ) no one can be coerced , through administrative measures or other methods , to contribute to the funds of a religious denomination . 
   ( 6 ) recognized denominations may receive material support from the state , on request , for expenditures related to the operation of denomination units , for repairs and new buildings , based on the number of worshipers as resulting from the latest census and based on their genuine needs . 
  so you see , although the state is considered neutral , it may give money to the different legally recognized denominations , and has been increasingly doing just that . 
  on both government and local levels . 
  and the romanian orthodox church , as the representative of about 90 % of the population , got the most of that money .

  a bit of context : antena tv group is the main anti-presidential media group . 
  i never heard of anything of the likes . 
  the more secular/western turks are also more nationalist and believe in the unity of the turkish nation as it was created by m. k. atat\u00fcrk, 
  yeah , but it 's mainly based in the anatolian hinterland . 
  the western coastal regions ( istambul , izmir ) tend to be more secular and west-oriented . 
  i did n't say it was the eu 's fault . 
  i said the euroskeptics , the ones that always love to paint the eu as a socialist distopya - ussr 2.0 - will have a field day . 
  reminds me of the '80s , [ when there was food shortage in commie romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_austerity_policy_in_romania ) . 
  when ceau\u0219escu used to visit stores and farmer 's markets , they would just take the same produce from shop to shop , and make it seem as if there was abundance . 
  everybody knows crazy stories of what local official would do to make it seem like the country was abundant .

  this is equally retarded . 
  and i hate it when people compare the eu with the ussr , but shit like this just fuels that side of the argument .

   and have this as your national anthem . 
  i 'd go with [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6s-fnlv2jq ), 
  i approve of this bunga-bunga !, 
   there is obviously a strong correlation between being an arab and being a muslim more like there is a strong correlation of being both muslim and a brown immigrant ( there are few arabs in the uk and germany , compared to south asians and turks ) . 
   i 'd also argue that hatred of all muslims , though idiotic and potentially dangerous , is not the same as anti-semitism because the jewish people are an ethnoreligious group ( one can be a jewish atheist , for example ) , while muslims are purely a religious group . 
  thing is , i would n't say that in the context of western europe , muslims are purely a religious group . 
  there is racial ( * for lack of a better word * ) dimension to the whole affair . 
  \u201e imagined communities '', 
  no stress . 
  thank you for the answer . 
  i kinda had a hunch , given how much emphasis you put on the bible . 
   saying `` you see ? 
  not only muslims are terrorists , the far right is too ! '', 
  cause one guy went postal . 
  i bet a lot of everyday muslim can empathize with that feeling , 
   i am a christian myself and relative to the place i live in i 'm a freaking fundie . 
  may i ask what denomination and where you live ? 
  i wan na try and get a feeling as to what theological point of view you 're coming from . 
  til galicia also has terorist-separatists . 
   people who lead their life based almost solely off that thing you may be overestimating the importance/influence of religion for some people 's daily lives . 
   some people are so heavily brainwashed careful making such strong allegations . 
  you might be misinterpreting the situation . 
  maybe it 's not about \u201e brainwashing '' . 
  maybe some people feel they cane achieve a sense of purpose . 
  fighting against dictatorship , against tyranny . 
  some people take their idealism very seriously . 
   the youths that went to syria to fight for muslim `` brothers '' that happened in other wars as well . 
  the spanish civil war , much like today in syria , saw [ foreign volunteers on both sides ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_spanish_civil_war )  wanting to have the islam a fully subsidized religion all religions want to be subsidized . 
  i was n't arguing for it to be public policy . 
  i was just correcting a factual statement .

  iirc smokers cost less on the system because they die sooner . 
  found it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_finance_balance_of_smoking_in_the_czech_republic  the public finance balance of smoking in the czech republic was a 2001 report commissioned by philip morris 's czech division following concerns raised by the czech health ministry that smoking 's costs outweighed its fiscal benefits . 
  the study was conducted by arthur d. little and found that ** smokers ' early mortality and cigarette-tax revenue , outweighed the costs of health-care and lost tax revenue from early death ** . 
  the study concluded through cost-benefit analysis `` based on up-to-date reliable data and consideration of all relevant contributing factors , the effect of smoking on the public finance balance in the czech republic in 1999 was positive , estimated at +5,815 mil .

  / u/martelfirst has expressed his opinion about how there should be less immigration into europe , about how immigrants of similar cultural background should be favored over those of more different culture and about how native ( white ) europeans should have more children . 
  he has always expressed his opinion in an articulate matter , and has not given us a reason to remove any of his comments . 
  from what i 've seen , i disagree with most of what he says , but that is not why i remove posts .
