  we have \u201e pricin\u0103 '' as well , albeit it 's a bit outdated . 
  i do n't think it 's weird , but then again , we do n't smile much in public either . 
   the sunshower = ploua cu soare \u201e \u00ce\u0219i bate dracu nevasta '' ( \u201e the devil is beating his wife '' ) is also used . 
  cool . 
  to answer your question , * spoiler * has n't made it into the dictionaries with the meaning used here , but it is in there with a meaning [ related to cars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_ ( automotive \\ ) ) . 
   \u0543 [ reminds me of ] ( http://www.cnadnr.ro/img/logo.jpg ), 
   \u0445\u0456\u0431\u0430 [ hib\u0103 ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/hib%c4%83 ) ? 
   also , is there any solid info about what will be added there as a permanent display ? 
  no idea tbh . 
  [ romania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/city_gate_towers.jpg ), 
  and the reichstag renovation , and the gerkin , and london city hall , to name a few . 
  the place where lenin used to be is now used as a platform for art instalations , and the statue is changed at certain intervals . 
  it 's called project 1990 , and my favourite exhibit was the [ lenin/hydra combo ] ( http://nn.by/image-cache/dbbda41e071082e1065725d8343a34cb_w499_h408_q75.jpg ) link with more pics : http://ioanaciocan.com/hidra/ another good one was the melting lenin : http://ioanaciocan.com/melting/, 
  fun fact : \u201e pl\u0103cint\u0103 '' comes from the latin \u201e placenta '' , itself from the ancient greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ( plak\u00f3eis , `` flat '' ) . 
  the medical term is named after the latin word for pie , because it looks like a pie ( not gon na link a pic of that in this thread ) . 
  it 's one of the few words that our neighbors adopted from us . 
  actually , \u201e dobos '' means \u201e drummer '' ( \u201e dob '' - \u201e drum '' , the musical instrument , + \u201e - os '' occupation suffix ) . 
  it was the name of the pastry-chef who invented it . 
  \u201e chocolate mouth orgasm '' would be something like \u201e csokisz\u00e1jorgazmus '' . 
  made it myself , with maps found on wikimedia commons . 
  this map would be perfect for some daily mail scaremongering ... 
  i did a map not too long ago , so i 'll post that one : http://i.imgur.com/zeyrrny.png, 
   allow me to disagree , alexandru ioan cuza from ia\u0219i is the oldest modern university on the territory of romania . 
  you 're not really disagreeing , as the title and my post did not specify ** modern ** university . 
  otoh , i now see that the title does specify `` in continuous operation '' , so ubb might not actually qualify , given its bumpy road . 
  i 'm guessing the name is of italian origin . 
  while the ia\u015fi university is the oldest established by the romanian state , the oldest one on the territory of modern romania is [ babe\u015f-bolyai univ. 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babe%c8%99-bolyai_university ) , established in [ 1581 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/babe%c5%9f-bolyai_university_logo.png ) , by transylvanian prince [ stephen b\u00e1thory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_b%c3%a1thory ) . 
   plural , not only one country did that so stealing history should be done in packs ...  people could see classicism everywhere in europe i 'm sure lithuania had a lot of classical architecture ...  and did n't mix styles . 
  you need to update your knowledge of architecture history . 
  ever hear of [ ecclectism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eclecticism_in_architecture ) ? 
  an example : [ neoclassic mixed with neo-baroque and neo-renaissance ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/f/fb/teatru_oradea_001.jpg ), 
   they are simply stealing history . 
  what 's your opinion of neo-classic architecture ( and triumphal arches for example ) in countries that were never part of the graeco-roman world ( like the roman empire ) ? 
  what about neo-gothic ( gothic revival ) architecture outside western europe ? 
   shutka 's mayor , elvis bairami well , of course his name is elvis ... 
   the country with the biggest % of the population in europe for foreigners is greece . 
  [ democracy index 2012 ] ( https://portoncv.gov.cv/dhub/porton.por_global.open_file?p_doc_id=1034 ) . 
  just a small comparison : country | rank | overall score | i electoral process and pluralism | ii functioning of government | iii political participation | iv political culture | v civil liberties | regime type -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- bulgaria | 54 | 6.72 | 9.17 | 5.71 | 6.11 | 4.38 | 8.24 | flawed democracy romania | 59 | 6.54 | 9.58 | 6.07 | 4.44 | 4.38 | 8.24 | flawed democracy turkey | 88 | 5.76 | 7.92 | 6.79 | 5.00 | 5.00 | 4.12 | hybrid regime, 
  is this [ oc ] ? 
  also , would have been interesting to see closed down facilities , such as chernobyl . 
  did n't lithuania also have a nuclear plant ? 
  that 's true , but these maps rarely feature regionalism . 
  it 's usually one word ( the standard one ) per language , as it does n't focus on countries as much as languages . 
  that being said , if you still think it should be changed , you should probably contact the creator of the map [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/22sjbp/police_in_various_european_languages_oc_1850950/ ) . 
  it 's light blue , but only on the western fringes , as most of ireland is majority anglophone . 
  it 's from [ 4 months ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/22sjbp/police_in_various_european_languages_oc_1850950/ ) and not made by me . 
  `` militia '' was the name of the police in bulgaria and romania until 1989 . 
  now it 's called `` police '' . 
   fun fact : bulgaria also had militsiya but we changed it to police and now use militsioner as a pejorative term for policemen fun fact : romania too . 
  * old joke : * q : what is the unit of measuring inteligence ? 
  a : the `` tsian '' . 
  its subdivisions are the `` decitsian '' , the `` centitsian '' and the `` militsian '' . 
  bourgeoisie , bourgeoisie everywhere !, 
  i was replying to his more general point , which was n't strictly about turks . 
  because everybody wants to be a victim , and nobody wants to be the bad guy .

  also , / r/europecirclejerk, 
   it 's not like we were celebrating the 0.1 % . 
  a lot of people seemed way too enthusiastic about that 0.1 % tbh . 
  imo , the 2019 elections will be important one for us to see if people started caring about euroelections . 
   or just shut the fuck up , one or the other . 
  stay calm , please . 
  no need to get in each other 's face .

  obligatory mention : / r/100yearsago, 
   they came in for a `` peacekeeping '' actually , i think they never left ... 
   i would also appreciate any feedback on the user interface , and how i may make it more functional/aesthetically pleasing . 
  well , sorry for the bluntness , but i find the interface terrible , both from a purely aesthetic pov and a. . . how shal i put it ... ideological ( may not be the best word ) point of view . 
  aesthetically it 's just too crowded , too many things going on on a very amateurishly made collage . 
  beyond that , the fact that you have 4 elements that scream `` serbian ultranationalism '' ( mladic , karadzhich , arkan and the 3-finger salute ) is not really helping you . 
  now it all depends on what you want to do with the subreddit . 
  if you want it to be a `` serb nationalist '' club than it 's ok , i guess . 
  but if you want to make it a sub where outsiders coe to get information about rep. srpska , you need to do the following imo : * get rid of the controversial stuff . 
  no portraits of people most of the world considers criminals against humanity . 
  * simplify the upper banner . 
  my opinion is you keep the flag , and just the flag . 
  * get a more matter-of fact map . 
  show rep. srpska as it is , not as you wish it to be .

  ** romania ** : generally , the interbellum ( mainly the 1920 's , the reign of [ king ferdinand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_i_of_romania ) ) , although it sometimes extends back to the late 19th century ( reign of king [ carol i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carol_i_of_romania ) ) .

  oh , this is freakin ridiculous ... 
  i actually liked the city itself ( the little i saw of it ) but i still hate it , generally speaking , as we got our car broken into and things stolen when i was there with my dad and so .
