  here 's a more serious video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r5dxqts3l0 more info on the dude : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luca_parmitano  in february 2011 , he was assigned as a flight engineer to expedition 36/37 ( a long-duration mission to the international space station ) which is scheduled for launch aboard soyuz tma-09m on 28 may 2013 . 
  his mission will be called volare , which means `` to fly '' in italian and is reminiscent of a very famous song by the italian singer domenico modugno . 
  some more : * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwjwvkp8xx0 * [ esa on fb ] ( https://www.facebook.com/europeanspaceagency ), 
  i have heard similar stories about shepherds in romania . 
   notice how the ping to sofia is nearly double than that of amsterdam , that 's because the data goes romania -  germany/netherlands -  bulgaria . 
  european routing is funny like that . 
  why does this happen ? 
  do you know of any statistics/projection etc detailing this and which can be linked ? 
  ** romania ** ** case a ** fresh out of college . 
  you get 50 % of the value of the reference social index ( rsi ) for 6 months . 
  the rsi is 500 lei ( $ 115 ) atm so you get $ 57 each month for half a year . 
  ** case b ( everybody else ) ** 75 % rsi ( so about $ 86 ) - if you had worked for at least 12 months + * x * % of your average monthly gross base salary for the last 12 months . 
  the * minimum * monthly gross base salary is 750 lei ( $ 172 ) atm and will be 800 lei ( $ 184 ) from july 1 ^ st depending on how much you worked , * x * % is as follows : - 3 % if you worked for minimum 3 years - 5 % if min . 
  5 years - 7 % if min . 
  10 years - 10 % if min . 
  20 years . 
  the benefits last for - 6 months if you worked at least 1 year - 9 months if you worked at least 5 - 12 months if you worked at least 10 years . 
  i found [ a paper comparing systems in europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/economic_paper/2012/pdf/ecb454_en.pdf ), 
  just a friendly reminder : there is a zero-tolerance policy on racism and personal attacks . 
  by all means , immigration and/or islam are topics that should be discussed . 
  however , they can also be discussed in a civil manner and with some tact . 
  actually , imagine the comment section here if this was a muslim country . 
  if this had happened in baku , instead of tbilisi , with imams instead of priests . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22665859 ), 
  he is no longer among us . 
  christian arabs are not necessarily the same thing as assyrians . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_arab  the syriac christian groups , composed largely of chaldo-assyrians , form the majority of christians in iraq , north east syria , south-east turkey and north-west iran . 
  they are generally defined as non-arab ethnic groups , including by the governments of iraq , iran and turkey . 
  assyro-chaldeans are practicing their own native dialects of syriac-aramaic language , in addition to also speaking local arabic dialects . 
  despite their ancient pre-arabic roots and distinct linguo-cultural identities , assyro-chaldeans are sometimes related by western sources as `` christians of the arab world '' or `` arabic christians '' , creating confusion about their identity . 
  syriac christians were also related as `` arab christians '' by pan-arab movements and arab-islamic regimes against their will . 
  [ comment thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f0jyx/dutch_anxiety_over_muslim_sharia_triangle_police/ca5os59 ) on / r/worldnews with other locals confirming this is bullshit . 
  in the press : * [ police , locals deny claim that part of the hague is a ` sharia triangle ' ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/05/police_locals_deny_claim_part.php ) * [ lodewijk asscher minister of social affairs sees no sharia in schilderswijk ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=www.google.nl%2fsearch%3fq%3dschilderswijk%2bsharia&amp;act=url ) ( g!translated ), 
  the video of the attack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4lmuahoru, 
   what 's the bright pink area on the border between azerbaijan and dagestan ? 
  [ tat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tat_language_ ( caucasus \\ ) )  what is the grey area in southern georgia ? 
  a mistake  why is the area just to the right of it , where most people speak azeri , marked with armenian ? 
  i guess they were trying to show the [ armenian population of samtskhe-javakheti region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenians_in_georgia ) , but failing . 
   why are all the caucasian languages lumped together ? 
  because the [ area is a clusterfuck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_caucasus ) , and given how little attention to detail the makers put into it , they took the easy way out . 
  this map is bullshit . 
  there are no bulgarians in dobrogea . 
  we had a populatian exchange in the early 20th c. also notice the non-existent russians in north moldavia . 
   and they all say calling the language `` moldavian '' is bullshit . 
  calling it by a different name is not ( necessarily ) the problem . 
  claiming its different is the problem . 
  catalan in valencia is called valencian , but afaik nobody claims it 's a different language than catalan . 
  also flemish and dutch are essentially the same . 
   how can people claim it 's a different language when it 's the same just different accent beats me . 
  well , the yugoslavs now claim serbian , croatian , bosnian and montenegrin as different languages , yet they are as different as romanian and moldovan . 
  bulgarians claim macedonian is nothing more than a bulgarian dialect . 
  there is a bit of arbitrariness as to where a dialect becomes a separate language . 
  romania too . 
  there are virtually no bulgarians in southern romania , and i have no idea where the russians in the north came from . 
  the germans are shown in their historical area , but they have been greatly reduced . 
  romanians in hungary are exagerated and the hungarians in romania are drawn badly . 
  this map is bad . 
  kosovo holds a lot of symbolic value to serbians and serbian orthodoxy . 
  it 's like their \u201e mount olympus '' . 
  because of [ an important battle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kosovo#aftermath_and_legacy ), 
   attila is written a double t and single l of course , you are right . 
   that would be like if mount olympus was a part of albania or italy , instead of greece . 
  or kosovo not part of serbia ... 
   edit : this map [ 1 ] and this link [ 2 ] seem to say that turkic peoples are one related group . 
  [ better map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/map-turkiclanguages.png ) . 
  and i do n't see how that seems to suggest that . 
  thank you for this . 
   i was shouted at because i kissed my girlfriend on the forehead . 
  oh god ... 
  i think it 's more of a title . 
  like how karolus magnus became charlesmagne and people think it 's a name . 
   i experienced a striking cultural difference crossing the border between turkey and georgia near posof in the lesser caucasus . 
  could you expand upon what these differences were ? 
  agreed . 
  even talking about one country as it 's one homogenous pot is an oversimplification . 
  also atilla . 
   kaloyan but i 'm not sure it 's unique , i have doubts that it has some greek influences in it . 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaloyan_of_bulgaria )  the name kaloyan ( latin : caloiohannes ) , translates as `` john the good '' or the `` john the handsome '' , and is derived from greek kaloi\u014dann\u0113s, 
   bogoljub this is serbian for gottlieb right ? 
  amadeus . 
  those are albanian garments , not armenian . 
   the turkic nations identify more with each other . 
  who they identify with and who they are more close culturally can differ a lot . 
  the whole balkans are culturally closer to turkey than to denmark , tbh . 
  also , bosnia and albania are more often than not considered european , even though they are majority muslim . 
  also relevant : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenopolis, 
   i 'm curious to see if europeans consider armenia part of europe ( culturally , ethnically , geographically ) geographically , not very . 
  culturally , yes . 
   what do europeans think of armenians in general ( good or bad impression ) i have n't had the pleasure of meating any , but we do have 2 politicians of armenian ethnicity who are quite known . 
  also , i know i have some armenians up the family tree . 
   i mean the survey would be pointless anyway since reddit 's demographics are completely unrepresentative of their constituent countries . 
  it 's totally irrelevant whether they are `` representative of their constituent countries '' . 
  the survey is intended to see what / r/europe 's opinion is ( to the extent we can measure it ) , not europe 's opinion . 
  the words `` pet peeves '' always makes me thick of something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qc6yq4t.jpg ) . 
  yes . 
   `` m\u00e9l '' looks weird . 
  give it time . 
  there was a time when \u201e parter '' , \u201e mar\u0219arier '' , \u201e vizavi '' and \u201e portofel '' looked weird in romanian , 
  subscriptions tripled yesterday compared to the usual number . 
  all of these are good suggestions .
