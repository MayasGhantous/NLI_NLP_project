  romanian male : decebal , r\u0103zvan, 
  yes . 
  3 times the usual number of subscribers today . 
   so the issue is that / r/europe [ 1 ] is not their primary subreddit ? 
  the issue is that there seems to be an influx of users from outside this subreddit , maybe from some racist subreddit , maybe from some chan board that is offsetting the voting in here . 
  this is not about \u201e primary '' or \u201e secondary '' subreddits . 
  i hate the ideology . 
  a lot of people hate the muslims themselves , not just the ideology . 
  a lot of people use \u201e racism '' instead of \u201e xenophobia '' . 
  racists from outside . 
  the number of subscribers are fast approaching 30.000 users . 
  given that we had surveys at 10k and [ 20k ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12sw8g/reurope_poll_results/ ) i bet we 'll have one at 30k as well . 
  it would be ideal , and we would be interested in suggestions . 
  now , people should use this thread to suggest questions , and they will be taken into consideration when making the survey . 
  ( no , i wo n't be the one to make it ) . 
  you know how electoral tourism is not democratic , in the sense that it does not reflect the true opinion of a constituency . 
  now imagine if a few busloads of racists appear and start `` voting '' opinions round here . 
   there never was any uniform `` american culture '' that is false . 
   also there are lots of tensions between various groups in the u.s. , is that good ? 
  but there are a lot of factors that play into that . 
   please tell me why multiculturalism is needed . 
  i never said it 's needed , as in something that needs to be imposed . 
  but i do not support forced monoculturalization . 
  the only thing that needs to be dealt with are the aspects of a culture that are incompatible with the host culture . 
  i really do n't give a fuck if another group in society does something differently and has other customs or whatnot , a long as they align with certain key aspects of the host culture . 
  your non-generalizing arguments are not welcome round here !, 
   have you even experienced multiculturalism ? 
  depends on your definition of multiculturalism . 
  not the multi-rasial kind in any significant degree . 
   obviously does n't work . 
  just because you say so ? 
  i 'm sure you 're very convinced of this , but immigrant countries of the new world - especially the us - show that immigrants can integrate without abandoning all their culture . 
   i do n't think you realize that `` half '' is n't a good number . 
  it 's quite relative . 
  if everywhere else is way less then that , it 's a good number , meaning the spaniards are gating something right . 
  it everywhere else is higher , that it 's very bad . 
   `` half of immigrants ' children do n't feel at home in spain '' . 
  first thing that popped into my head . 
  no , i want them to integrate . 
  i want them to keep the benign aspects of their culture and loose the backwards parts . 
  i have no reason to demand they totally abandon their culture . 
  also , i do n't think everything about the host european culture is super-duper awesome . 
  some parts of political-correctness are retarded and do n't even get me started on the `` culture '' of some of the xenophobes . 
  yet those are parts of \u201e western culture ^ tm '' talking about culture as a monolithic thing is simplistic . 
  not to mention the fact that `` cultural critique '' sometimes is not much more than `` foreigner critique '' . 
  but muh culture ... 
  ethnonyms are quite common family names among hungarians . 
  for example , common hungarian surnames include n\u00e9meth `` german , '' horv\u00e1t `` croat , '' t\u00f3th an outdated term for `` slovak '' , ol\u00e1h an outdated term for `` wallachian '' , and lengyel `` polish . 
  '' ^ [ [ 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_names#hungarian_surnames ) ], 
  those are not fake . 
  the design changed . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_coins#current_design  in 2007 , a new design was introduced to reflect the enlargement of the eu in 2004 . 
  the design still retains all elements of the original designs , including the twelve stars , however the map of the fifteen states is replaced by one showing the whole of europe as a continent , without borders . 
  the vertical ridges only appear over the sea . 
   who would say that ? 
  [ one recent example ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1eqp0d/muslim_immigration_in_sweden_short_documentary/ca315gm )  thank god i only occasionally visit here and do n't open up most threads anymore unfortunately i 've noticed there 's been a lot less activity from quality users and it really saddens me . 
  and sadly , mods alone ca n't do all the work needed to turn this sub around . 
  and some people say we do n't have a problem with racism here ... 
  israel is pretty multiculti too given how there are jews from all over the world , plus druze , plus arabs , plus samaritans , and so on . 
   i think the mods are doing a good job at combating xenophobia . 
  thank you  i just also think that it 'd be nice if the community got to put in more of a word . 
  you and me both . 
   with gross generalizations and then ...  / r/europe is the second sub most similar to srs . 
  a thuggish and irrational brigade of shariah loving vigilantes bent on flaming everyone that dares to have a different and often constructive opinion . 
   corrupt mods corrupt how ? 
  you refer to the paid spammer allegations ? 
   the mods are the only ones with a real * incite * into its full scale . 
  do n't you mean * insight * ? 
  or are you saying we incite racism ? 
  british english in school , american english on the tv . 
   aaah the old trick of mixing the concepts of culture and race to silence opinions that you do n't like under vague statement goes well with the old trick of mixing the concepts of culture and race to get racist opinions that mods do n't like through to others via vague statements, 
  my impartiality in moderating has nothing to do with the decision to keep davidreiss . 
  you might be thinking about `` credibility '' , but you 're conflating two issues that are independent of each other . 
   now it 's censorship and heavy moderation 24/7 yeah . 
  we really need more comments like :  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/izl3kek.jpg ) - is the root problem or  [ you almost reached category 3 !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1i48gwu.jpg ) keep it going sweden , nobody takes you seriously anymore or  muslims and niggers . 
  just admit it . 
  i see . 
   oh yeah and latin , that does not count , but belgian schools love their latin !, 
  i know what you mean . 
  we have that in romania as well . 
  only one foreign language in wallonia ? 
  learning both flemish and english does not seem that much to me tbh . 
   basically if you do n't agree or align with the mods , you 're gone . 
  this is blatantly false . 
  you can disagree with the mods all you want on whatever subject you wish . 
  there are people on this sub who are against immigration and islam and who cam make their case and they suffer no consequences . 
  what the mods are against is : 1 . 
  `` you are a idiot '' etc. ), 
  racism and other forms of xenophobia ( eg . 
  `` all irish are wankers '' `` all muslims are animals '' ) we are trying to censor as little as possible but at the same time be intolerant towards racism , so that this subreddit does n't turn to shit . 
  is n't flemish taught in walonia ? 
  context matters . 
  it 's still richer than 2 eu members ... 
  the blue banana really stands out in this one ... 
  also spot the western christianity/orthodox christianity divide, 
  there are many types of gypsies , some of which do no adhere to that ` culture ' people think of . 
  putting some unemployed ` favela-dweller romas ' with little gypsy culture in the same bascket with some ` traditional ' gypsies that largely keep to themselves and are skilled craftsmen is a bit of an oversimplification . 
  so far , the thing that seems to work best in getting them out of both poverty and a traditionalist insular mindset is neoprotestantism , oddly enough . 
  there is still a lot of dormant anti-semitism .
