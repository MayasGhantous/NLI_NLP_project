  not many jews to shout slurs at , but there still is quite enough . 
  nowhere near the level of hungary though ... 
  you should write a book about it . 
  you could name it `` my struggle '' . 
  seems like a catchy title . 
  this is not a pipe, 
  i confirm this . 
  those are awesome series . 
  [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1642o8/dear_reurope_id_like_to_watch_some_of_your_tv/ ), 
   this particular course of action has already been put into effect in the city of utrecht , where similar problems have been dealt with by demolishing critical areas that acted as enclaves of hate . 
  interesting . 
  do you have anything more detailed about the action in utrecht ? 
  like an article or something ? 
  romania checking in . 
  this is us : video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m9iix4ehdy interpretation : [ tumblr ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/6c42f908eb8c3467d052614bb3559a6e/tumblr_mmwthmjqzk1qasnlzo1_500.jpg ) ~ ~ the shame ... ~ ~ * fuck it , i changed my mind . 
  we were fabulous and i regret nothing !, 
  how interesting . 
  does this stem from something like the fact that the political power was in low german area but the prestige dialect was some form of high german ? 
  ok , i can work with car analogies . 
  * you have have a peugeot . 
  your neighbour has a renault . 
  your other neighbour has a bmw , or a fiat , each inherited from their father . 
  now suddenly , the state says that for the sake of national unity we are all renault-owners , and only renault owners can benefit from state subsidies , and only renault can open spare part shops , and all mechanics are only trained to fix renaults . 
  * * so you either learn to fix it yourself and pay extra to ship in parts from abroad and so on , or you sell the peugeot to the scrap yard and go through the trouble of saving up money for a new car , a renault . 
  the people who inherited renaults do not have this financial handicap , and you ca n't help but wonder if the state is treating everyone equally or favoring renault-owners . 
  * the thing is i understand where you are coming from , but france had the unique advantage of implementing this policy early . 
  hungary tried as well a bit later and it lead to the alienation of its non-hungarian speakers ( including transylvania romanians ) . 
  turkey tried this and they 've been having trouble with the kurds since forever . 
  greece is the only other country that managed to pull off this french style system . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the french system has some inherent flaws that make it seem anything but fair when you 're in the minority . 
  i say we call it a day . 
   and therefore do not exist legally . 
  but they do exist , even if the state does n't recognize them . 
  if turkey only recognizes turkish as a language , is the turkish language not given preferential status over kurdish ? 
   do you have any examples of dialects that appeared recently ? 
  that evolved over the past one or two centuries ? 
  i ca n't think of one . 
  dialect , no . 
  but the [ northern cities vowel shift ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_cities_vowel_shift ) is a phonetic divergence that is fairly recent ( 19th century ) . 
  also keep in mind that languages can also appear via language contact . 
  [ singlish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singlish ) is an english-based creole which similarly has its origins in the 19th century . 
  [ a video about it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg5gr-rjewy ) [ tok pisin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tok_pisin ) is another example of language on the rise which has its roots in english ( although it might be a bit older ) . 
  i 'm sure there are better examples of recent appearances i 'm not aware of . 
   oh i get where you 're at . 
  i 'm not an advocate of the french system , i was simply trying to explain why the french constitution is the way it is . 
  i see . 
  i misread your intentions then . 
   unitary europe : not doable . 
  i agree . 
  languages can still diverge even with increased communication . 
  think of how english differs in different regions of the world . 
  also relying on a written language does not mean the languages will converge . 
  arabic has a written standard - msa - but the spoken versions are very different from one another . 
  dialects will continue to form even in today 's interconnected world . 
  sure , smaller languages might die out , but the big ones are n't going anywhere . 
  my original point was to take the model you advocate , and bring it up a level so that french is not the dominant language anymore , but one of those regional languages that you think is easily expendable for the sake of national unity . 
  i used the example of federal europe because it was the most likely candidate , and because by your logic , that would need a unifying language as well . 
  a better , but way more unlikely , example would be \u201e the centralized and unitary nation of europe '' . 
  the problem is now we are talking about how the federal system is not the same as the french system . 
  but i would have assumed you are an advocate of the french system , since you seemed to co me to its defense . 
  now i 'll ask one more time : * do you support the implementation of the french system on a european level , given its advantages , with french being replaced by english ? 
  by the very fact that it recognizes only one language there is a dominant linguistic group . 
   that 's the equality part in our motto yeah . 
  everybody is equal , but the dominant linguistic group is more equal than the others . 
   how would state language be irrelevant in a federation ? 
  i was making the analogy with france 's constitution and its one language policy , but moving it up from the state level to the federal level . 
  \u201e the only official language of the eu is english '' and that would make state languages something extra-curricular , thus hardly relevant ( or at least , as relevant to the federation as breton or occitan ) . 
   you get the federal language ( official , everyone knows it ) , and then the state language . 
  then you could very well add regional languages as well . 
  how are they different ? 
  that 's why i gave it only as an example of what i would like to see . 
  a nice detailed census , or survey at least , would answer a lot of questions . 
   it 's not like there will be any problem afterwards , right catalonia ? 
  the policies of language supression during franco have more to do with catalonia 's dislike of madrid than the charter you speak of . 
  on the other hand , valencia and the balearics do n't seem to be going anywhere . 
  neither is galicia . 
  even the basques seem to have calmed down . 
  selection bias much ? 
  it would be much better if there would be some large surveys , or if the census inquired about mother tongue . 
  it avoids problems inherent to anecdotal evidence and other biases . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_in_france#statistics ) . 
   it 's inevitable that we all speak one language someday . 
  no we wo n't . 
  languages tend to die out , yes , but they also tend to diverge . 
   imagine you 're only ever taught in gaelic because you live in a region where most people speak it , and you travel , you look for a job , and you end up in endinburgh and everyone else speaks english . 
  you 're not going to feel like you belong , even though it 's your country . 
  imagine you are born into a minority , and you go to 1st grade and are expected to learn everything in the official language , which you almost never heard in your familial environment . 
  you feel like the system is set up for the dominant linguistic group . 
  they get the privilege of having their mother tongue made official , for you it 's an extra obstacle you have to overcome . 
  you have to take extra steps to protect and cultivate your language , while for the others , the state does it by default . 
  there are more ways than one to feel like you do n't belong , even though it 's your country . 
   as long as there is an equal amount of opportunities to learn both english and whatever the language in our state is . 
  well , state language would be irrelevant now . 
  we would have the common english language , which would make \u201e national languages '' obsolete , and then everybody else could learn whatever they would want . 
  you are avoiding the question . 
  i did n't ask whether we are there yet . 
  i asked whether you support it when the eu becomes a federation . 
  so do you support making english the only official language of the eu if it becomes a full blown federation ? 
  that 's because it does n't yet have an army and a navy . 
  wallachia is now available .
