  seconded . 
  well , except for the greater romania party , which is an old-people 's party , so not very relevant , i would agree that young romanians might have a tendency to be more conservative then their dutch peers . 
  anyway , my point was that if there is a tendency for young muslims in europe to be more religious then their parents , it should be viewed in the context of the entirety of islam ( and not just islam if you look into it ) , not just as a local , european , phenomenon . 
  i wa n't trying to suggest that muslims are stuck in the 80s . 
   it 's easy to take small things , bend them a little bit out of proportion , add a small bit of prejudice and out comes something that has the sound of being reasonable . 
  this is a great quote . 
  i 'm stealing this !, 
   with a name like callum , only half . 
  what 's the other half ? 
  how about nobody leaves and we sort this shit out together ? 
  well , i think it has to do with the fact that both india and pakistan have a huge number of muslims . 
  ` issue ' would have been a more appropriate term . 
  i think i understand . 
  but i find the logic a bit weird . 
  even if race does not exist , people can be racist . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  sure , i agree that there are many variables . 
  i actually think that in a decade or so the identification of youngsters with religion ( islam ) will have declined significantly in europe as well . 
  so now they removed the word * race * from there ? 
  does n't that actually decriminalize racism ? 
  what am i missing here ? 
   they see their identity as so closely tied to their religion thanks to the media and so on , and bam - they 're more religious . 
  while i agree that the media and our discourse in general puts too much emphasis on `` muslims '' , that is not the only factor . 
  young muslims live in a different zeitgeist than their parents . 
  think how in the 50s and 60s the dominant ideology in the arab world was arab nationalism ( secular and leftist ) but since the 80s it shifted to a more islamist mood . 
  i think that this shift in ideology influences the difference in immigrant identity ( old secular vs. young religious ) that a lot of people talk about . 
   killing apostles apostates . 
  what are some of the laws that featured the word `` race '' in them ? 
  the same way you can be religious even though god does not exist ... 
   note that 15 % of people born in greece have foreign-born parents ( not necessarily illegal ) . 
  how many of those foreign born parents are diaspora greeks who returned to greece ? 
   you 've got a real american shit sandwich in your hands . 
  i 'd say america handles multiculturalism way better than europe . 
  here we go again ... 
  geographically . 
  it does , but i 'm surprised that they did n't give at least a `` georgia is not in europe '' as they would have done with turkey . 
  i 'd say georgia is as european as cyprus . 
  downvoted because ? 
   do n't be an idiot . 
  please try to keep it civil . 
   wallachia per chance ? 
  if you will , sure . 
   also can you order the list alphabetically for easier lookup ? 
  i was actually thinking about ordering them alphabetically into 3 groups : state flags , regional flags and other . 
  i have to investigate how that 's done . 
  there are people who actually like him . 
  i can not for the life of me understand why ... 
  you will if you subscribe to / r/vexillology , 
  done !, 
  you can change the text if you do n't like it as it is now . 
  also , romania was probably involved somehow and the thus the * de facto * suspect . 
  enjoy , 
  and voila !, 
  it 's only 16x11 pixels . 
  adding a black frame would make it look weird and take up too much of the width . 
  ** le : ** i darkened the lower white band . 
  tried adding a black border but it looks really bad . 
  so what are the likely scenarios ? 
  lombardy is now available if you wish to use it . 
  fix 'd, 
   now , if i could use a regional flag instead , i would !, 
  what region would you like to use ? 
  i have set some up , and will add others if requested . 
  done !, 
  i could not find any relevant flag . 
  ca n't galicia do for now ? 
  now available . 
  you want it ? 
  now available . 
  you want it ? 
  do the reptilians have a flag ? 
  now available . 
  now available . 
  you want it ? 
  now available . 
  you want it ? 
  why is your dalmatian flag different from [ wikipedia 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_dalmatia ) ? 
   i 'd like to , but i do n't consider this is suitable for this subreddit . 
  after all , that lovely flag does n't have any legitimacy right now . 
  why do you say that ? 
   most of the spanish redditors would wear a republican flair over the current one . 
  will be available later today , 
  still , we celebrate the declaration , not its ratification , which is more of an administrative measure . 
  same way we celebrate the declaration of december 1 , 1918 as the day of union between transylvania and the rest of romania , even thought the union went official through the treaty of trianon , which was signed in june ( i think ) 1920 . 
  anyway , doing some googling , i noticed there does seem to be a mild disagreement on the date . 
  there is a bill submited to make [ may 9th official and free day ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/cultura/aldine/9-mai-ziua-independentei-de-stat-301429.html ), 
  nope . 
  the declaration of independence was read by kog\u0103lniceanu ( then pm ) in parliament on [ may 9th 1877 ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_mai ) , thus the 9th became independence day . 
  may 10th used to be [ king 's day ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/ziua_na%c8%9bional%c4%83_a_rom%c3%a2niei ) , the national day during the monarchy . 
   the eu version of the vatican . 
  more like the eu version of dc, 
  yurp !, 
  i 'm really surprised people complain about not knowing about this . 
  it appears to be fairly well covered in the news in romania . 
  even better than the fact that it 's independence day today . 
  i do n't think the title suggests that \u201e we should despise ourselves '' or that it 's \u201e demonizing our civilization '' . 
  sure , the title is an exaggeration , the tone could have been less sensationalist ( * the press these days * ) and putting pulverized mummies down as cannibalism is a bit of a stretch , but you 're verdict feels just as exaggerated . 
  the way i read the title is this : \u201e while we tend to think of cannibalism as something foreign , there have been instances of it in europe as well , but historiography has tended to ignore it , because we like to think happy thoughts about ourselves '' .
