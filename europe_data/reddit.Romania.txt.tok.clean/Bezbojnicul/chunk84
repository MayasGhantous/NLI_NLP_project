  romanians refer to irish travellers as '' \u021aigani irlandezi '' for example . 
  depends on your definition of gypsies . 
  some people use the word in a more broad way to mean all nomadic minorities similar to the roma . 
  but i agree , irish travellers are not roma . 
  thank you !, 
  i do n't think the narrative where cannibalism was used to demonize the other made that distinction . 
   good thing the media is always here to tell us how much * we should despise ourselves * . 
  i think you 're reading too much into it . 
  i 'd really like to see a breakdown of these `` foreign origin '' brusselers . 
  fun fact : former chinese president jiang zemin spoke romanian . 
  france has been loosing prestige internationally for some time . 
  it 's not just within romania because of the roma issues . 
  it 's a bigger trend . 
   since there is a flemish flag why is there no flag for what is basically the other half of the country ? 
  it 's usually the flemish who have a strong regional flemish identity , rather than a national `` belgian '' one . 
   and if you only allow regions with separatist groups but we allow other regions as well . 
  they 're not necessarily separatist . 
  vojvodina is not separatist . 
  neither is gagauzia ( although it was a little in the early 90s ), 
  did n't think there would be demand , tbh . 
  u/davidreiss666 is not a flair , and therefore not the subject of this discussion . 
  afaik there is no official ni flag as all the factions ca n't seem to agree on one . 
  there is one right above uk, 
  i try not to mix my feelings into things like this . 
  i 'm not ok with northern cyprus either , and i personally think that turkey should fuck off from there , but the reality still stands that the turkish republic of northern cyprus exists , and as such , i included it as an option . 
  also , no need to choose a hypothetical transylvanian option . 
  transnistria is to romanians pretty much analogous to northern cyprus ( illegal occupation-state ) . 
  which is included as well . 
  as putea scrie `` virgin mary 's garden '', 
  you want it ? 
  done . 
  it was already included in the flair collection since last night . 
  the list includes more then just sovereign states . 
  one recognition is still a recognition . 
  that makes sense . 
  thank you !, 
   you guys realise that 's an illegally occupied territory , right ? 
  it 's also a partially recognised state ( unlike hezbollah ) . 
  that is a coat of arms . 
   trentino alto adige i 've added sud-tyrol  friuli-venezi giulia i 've added the historical flag of [ friuli ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/bandiere_dal_fri%c3%bbl.svg/500px-bandiere_dal_fri%c3%bbl.svg.png ) plus the other 3 . 
  you 're the second person with this problem . 
  i 'm trying to fix it . 
   edit : this one [ 1 ] would be accepted , too . 
   if i were you i 'd only add the special ones like valle d'aosta , friuli-venezia giluia . 
  i 'll probably go with this , as it 's easier just to remove veneto than add all . 
   you guys are all welcome to / r/turkey if such issues interest or perhaps worry you . 
  thanks for the invitation . 
  i 'd personally like to see more turkish redditors contributing here . 
  i know it 's quite hostile at times , unfortunately . 
  thing is , i do n't have [ this part ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/1dsi4r/adding_multiple_instances_of_flair_on_both_sides/c9tg138 ) in the code for it to be needing removal . 
  what are you trying to type ? 
  thank you for taking the time to give an insider perspective . 
  oh , thank you !, 
  done, 
  done !, 
  oh , sorry , my bad . 
  i 'll see what i can do . 
  ~ ~ edit : until then , feel free to request edits to the flair text . ~ ~ now editable !, 
  ( maybe ), 
  what other regions of italy have strong regional identities ? 
  is there a unified one ? 
  i can only find [ upper ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/flagge_preu%c3%9fen_-_provinz_oberschlesien.svg/200px-flagge_preu%c3%9fen_-_provinz_oberschlesien.svg.png ) , [ lower ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/flagge_preu%c3%9fen_-_provinz_schlesien.svg/200px-flagge_preu%c3%9fen_-_provinz_schlesien.svg.png ) and [ czech ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/flag_of_czech_silesia.svg/200px-flag_of_czech_silesia.svg.png ) silesian , but no silesian in general . 
  ~ ~ actually , you can already do this . 
  when you select your flair , you can write anything you want in the box below the flags . ~ ~ ~ ~ see this image : http://i.imgur.com/w1guddo.png~~, 
  you are looking for / r/europecirclejerk, 
  do n't forget romanian ... 
  i ignored that rule so the words apear stylistically the same . 
   also , the `` kitri '' used in georgia is probably the same root as `` cetriolo '' in italy . 
  again , you might be right , and somebody else noticed this too , but without some confirmation , i 'm hesitant to change it . 
   and `` hjara '' in malta is the same as the arabic `` hiyar '' but i think your colo-coding makes it look like it is the same as in italy . 
  maltese is the same color as arabic , but the outline fucks the color perception up, 
  you might be right , but i would like some source to confirm it before i change it . 
   lubenita = watermelon depending on region . 
  in the south they use ` pepene ' for both cantaloupe and watermelon, 
  here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm , 
   and why is german apfel in the same group as slavic jabolka ? 
  it sounds completely different . 
  same etymology , from from proto-indo-european * h \u2082 \u00e9bl , * h \u2082 eb\u014dl, 
  the only problem is that that map needs to be fixed . 
  greek/albanian and romanian/italian actually share the same etymology, 
  did n't greece drop the reconstructed katharevousa in the 60s or 70s and go with the more popular demotiki ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1csmt5/the_word_for_the_cucumber_in_various_european/c9k6ujl ), 
  oh , ok .  fixed . 
  any idea about the etymology ? 
  it 's closer to portuguese, 
  i 'll add `` trangull '' as a variant asap , but i 'm not going to erase ` kastravac ' as per [ this discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1csmt5/the_word_for_the_cucumber_in_various_european/c9jt13i ), 
  the same could be said of polish , to be honest . 
  it depends . 
  there is a sizeable slavic influence in the language . 
  but some of it was outphased in the 19th-20th century , and some words got replaced with french and italian borrowings . 
  a more recent version , higher resolution , with some errors corrected : http://i.imgur.com/mzyzdkz.png ( v. 3 ) ** legend : ** * ** purple ** ( central , northern and eastern europe + greece ) - ultimately from medieval greek '' [ angourion ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gherkin&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) '' . 
  greek is from a word for `` immature '' and the vegetable originated in northern india and came to eastern europe via the byzantine empire . - [ etymonline ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gherkin&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) ) . 
  * ** orange ** `` cucumber '' ( western europe ) - from latin '' [ cucumerem ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cucumber&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) '' ( nominative `` cucumis '' ) , perhaps from a pre-italic mediterranean language . 
  * ** light green ** `` krastavica '' ( balkans ) - from slavonic `` krastav\u016d '' - '' [ scaby ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/castravete/429085 ) '' via bulgarian `` kr\u00e1stavica '' probably refering to the aspect of its skin . 
  * ** dark green ** `` hiyar '' ( muslim countries ) - from the persian '' [ xiy\u00e2r ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d8%ae%db%8c%d8%a7%d8%b1#persian ) '' from middle persian `` xy\u0101r '' . 
  * ** orangered ** `` pepino '' ( portuguese & spanish ) a diminutive of latin '' [ pepo ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pepo ) '' ( melon , pumpkin ) , in turn from the ancient greek \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd ( pep\u014dn ) * ** light blue ** `` cetriolo '' ( italian ) - from the latin word '' [ citrium ] ( http://www.myetymology.com/italian/cetriolo.html ) '' ( kind of gourd ) via the latin '' [ citriolum ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cetriolo#italian ) '' * ** magenta ** `` cularan '' ( scottish gaelic ) - [ earth nut ] ( http://www.ceantar.org/dicts/mb2/mb12.html ) * ** red ** `` kornischong '' ( luxemburg ) - from the french `` cornichon '' ( mening `` gherkin '' ) , a diminutive of '' [ corne ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corne#french ) '' meaning `` horn '' , which in turn comes from latin . 
  * ** pink ** `` varung '' ( armenia ) - an [ iranian borrowing ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d5%be%d5%a1%d6%80%d5%b8%d6%82%d5%b6%d5%a3 ) from middle persian ( v\u0101trang ) , ( v\u0101tr\u0113ng ) , persian ( b\u0101drang , `` a species of cucumber ; an orange '' ) , ( v\u0101rang , `` a long crooked cucumber ; a large lemon or orange-tree '' ) . 
  small text means a regional language ( friulian , sorbian , occitan , megleno-romanian , etc ) . 
   the use of that word is ignorant is many ways regardless of `` etymological fallacy '' . 
  that may or may not be true .
