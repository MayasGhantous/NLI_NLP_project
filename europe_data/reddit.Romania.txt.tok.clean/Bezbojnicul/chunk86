  who would you want to `` give a shit '' ? 
  would you like brussels to force romania to give the szeklers autonomy ? 
   the attrocities are not mentioned in the schoolbooks , while those that happened against the jews and serbs are . 
  well , they should be . 
   my point is , most peoples have gotten over it ... 
  depends . 
  romania has n't completely gotten over the separation of moldavia , for example . 
   but you 'll hear orban talking about slovakia , romania ... 
  this is a dangerous thing especially since in the case of hungary we 're talking about breaking up countries with frontiers as old as 100 years for what ? 
  could you expand on this ? 
  what has orban said regarding slovakia and romania that is a danger to the territorial status-quo ? 
   because , if you revisit it , you 'll have hungary 's neighbors feeling screwed even more ... and rightfully so . 
  it 's not a contest . 
  i 'd say it 's more antisemitic than romania . 
  is this their site ? 
  http://magyarnarancs.hu/archivum please try to remember additional details . 
   the trianon pact is still seen as that point in history where hungary was screwed well , to be fair , they kinda got screwed . 
  i agree with the rest . 
   statistical analysis i have read . 
  might we read it too ? 
  this was actually an american retalian for the boston bombings ^ ^ * / jk *, 
  msp took me a bit as well . 
  i 'm all with you on the fact that less acronyms are better . 
   snp scottish national party  msp member of the scottish parliament  uav not really sure , but given how it 's in the same sentence as drones , i bet it 's something like \u201e unmanned aircraft/army vehicle ''  atm at the moment, 
   predictions for next sunday 's news : cypriots rushing to hospitals due to overeating . 
  this is not a joke . 
  it happens like clockwork every christmas and easter . 
  i know the feel brother . 
  usually a few weeks before christmas and easter , the number of gall bladder medicine ads increase ten-fold . 
   if you wanted to name one single person as `` the man who beat hitler '' , i think your only options are either churchill or hitler himself . 
  or stalin . 
  fair enough . 
   are those adjectives sufficiently elevated/pompous for your exquisite taste ? 
  this is not about `` my taste '' . 
  this is about mod policy , and the policy is that cursing is not allowed . 
  on the other hand you can be as smug as you want . 
   they 've tried to `` rehabilitate '' some of them i italy individually by disconnecting them from their families . 
  [ this is n't a new idea ] ( http://ling.uni-graz.at/~rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml ) . 
  or a particularly good one tbh . 
  there are some big differences even between different roma groups inside each country . 
  do n't get into the habit of using offensive language . 
  calling people you disagree with `` hippie assholes '' ( emphasis on `` assholes '' ) is asking for your comment to be removed by the other mods . 
  ( and no , it wo n't be me , as i have a conflict of interests here ), 
  way to overreact . 
  there are many subreddits where you can air your views unchallenged ( you could even create some yourself ) . 
  this is not one of them . 
  get used to it . 
  what i was saying - in case it 's too difficult - is that you 're stating the obvious . 
  there is a significant portion of gypsies that do not have bulibasas . 
  your description applies to traditional gypsies . 
   so no evidence to say that they are built without a permit they were probably built with permit in the same degree as any house in romania . 
  also , the rules governing distance between neighbours ( civil code , article 600-ish ) can be bypassed if the neighbors reach an agreement . 
  i mention this because the area looks crammed as shit . 
  also , there is no control that might govern the aesthetics of a house in the rural parts , except the local chief-architect , who 's under the mayor 's . 
  my grandpa was an architect , and he had a lot of gypsy clients ( albeit in a different area , where they built normal houses ) , so i do n't think they necessarily built it illegally . 
  it 's easier to change the local laws in your favor , than to do things illegally ( especially given how permissive rural areas are anyway ) . 
  i would be curios to see the local general urban plan tbh . 
   respect for the law and its unprejudiced application is paramount . 
  true that . 
  but harsher punishment should befall on all those who disregard the law , not just the gypsies . 
  today , when something is built without permission , the state fines you and forces you to get a project for what 's already there . 
  you 'll never be forced to demolish it . 
  and trust me , a lot of non-gypsy houses would be demolished if they started demolishing .

   * cigonu g. * is that `` gypsy street '' ? 
  we have that too . 
  bucketloads of it . 
  poor black americans are the most notorious , but far from the only ones http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bling-bling, 
  this is not a one-sided issue . 
  indeed . 
  this is a worldwide phenomenon . 
  the gypsies have their own ( flamboyant ) style , but it 's by no means a local thing . 
  the romanian architecture magazine igloo had an album on the subject called \u201e [ kastello - palaces of the roma in romania ] ( http://www.igloo.ro/colectii/22/ ) '' . 
  i think some of the text inside the album is the one found here : http://www.rozylowicz.com/retirement/kastellos/kastellos.html ( although i 'm not entirely sure ) also : here are the [ roma houses of huedin , cluj county ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/mpvau ) . 
  and a [ poorer `` colony '' ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/thdpv ) between osorhei and alparea in bihor county . 
  ** bonus video from buzescu : http://www.trilulilu.ro/video-divertisment/palatele-tiganesti-din-buzescu, 
   well i was in my second year at electrical engineering when i started studying architecture . 
  why ? 
  ( i ask because the job market is kind of shitty for architects , but seems to be quite better for engineers ), 
  from a serbian redditor ( / u/kafkaonthetrial ) , over at / r/balkanpolitics :  this is n't really a historic apology , the former president of serbia boris tadi\u0107 visited srebrenica in 2010 , apologised and serbian parliament at the time issued the declaration condemning the 1995 srebrenica crime . 
   what 's historic about this is that this guy who 's now so eloquently apologising was actually an ultra-nationalist of the worst kind for most of his political career . 
  in the last few years he revised his stances a bit ( concerning mostly eu ) in order to get elected . 
  what 's happening right now is , i guess , beyond anyone 's wildest dreams and most of the people who voted for him now consider him to be a traitor , foreign spy etc ; while the people who rightfully hated him now view him as a pleasant surprise . 
  personally i do n't know what to make of it . 
   i do n't mean any offense neither do i. 
  it was a small fuck-up by a tv channel , and i 'd thought it 's funny enough to share . 
  i just framed the title as to remind people that not only \u201e murica '' fuckes up . 
  this time is was something from the uk . 
  next time , some other place . 
   the clearest invitation to a circle-jerk i 've seen in a while . 
  no it 's not , and i trust the users of this subreddit to handle a title such as this . 
  nobody said anything bad about the brits in this whole thread , and i was n't expecting them to . 
   balcanic but romania isn '' t in the peninsula except dobrudzha . 
  but we 're of the balkans without really being in the balkans, 
   i 'm familiar with the subreddit and the name also annoys me you must be fun at parties ...  a tv channel are getting ** thing 's ** wrong * things * , 
   primaria = hall ( ? ) . . 
  the thing for mayors town hall / mayor 's office, 
  [ godless ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bezbozhnik_ ( magazine \\ ) ), 
  my what ? 
  that still does n't explain the gap in employment , which is much smaller in the east , not because more non-roma are unemployed but because more roma * are * employed .
