  ( slide 3 ), 
   chechnya ( yes i knwo it 's not europe ) actually , [ it is ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/map_of_europe_%28political%29.png ) . 
  i do n't much dissagree with you actually . 
  i just think that this statistic is meant to show the willingness in post-89 romania more than anything . 
  sure , we can compare a century 's worth off data ( if we have it ) , but then all the data has to be put in it 's proper context . 
  not saying pre-89 is not important . 
   know how to read and a bit more about austria than : `` they 've got some really tasty ~ ~ kangaroos ~ ~ * swans * '' ftfy  it 's not voter turnout ... 
  it 's not but comparing pre-89 with post-89 means nothing , as pre-89 the state actively forced many roma to go to school . 
  the study is significant as it shows growth of highschool graduation post-89 . 
  it 's a bit `` apples and oranges '' to compare the rates in 2 different systems . 
  maybe to you . 
  but a lot of people still think that a significant proportion of roma are nomadic , as opposed to the general population . 
  given how they cite western european countries as the main source , i 'd tend to agree . 
  but i would n't be surprised if there some balkan muslims as well . 
  maybe even some from russia too ( caucasus ) . 
  i do n't really get offended by these things either , but a lot of my countrymen do , that 's why i mentioned it . 
  i remember that . 
  had a good laugh !, 
  interesting how eastern europe seems to have a smaller gap than western europe . 
   because ~ ~ we do n't give a fuck ~ ~ of ~ ~ all that famous tolerance ~ ~ marijuana . 
  * something , something * dracula !, 
  but that would be like comparing voter turnout when voting is mandatory to voter turnout 10 years later when voting is optional . 
   if that 's childish to you , oh well . 
  i meant the attitude that \u201e some decades of communism seem insignificant '' and that the division made sense only while the iron curtain was up . 
  divisions like the iron curtain leave [ long ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_a_and_b ) [ shadows ] ( http://www.dw.de/breaking-down-the-wall-in-the-head/a-1344803 ) . 
   i do n't feel western but central european as i said in a different comment , the two terms are not necessarily mutually exclusive . 
  `` eastern europe '' is just shorthand for post-commie europe . 
  i 'll leave [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/center_of_europe ) here, 
  romania as well . 
  central , eastern and south-eastern, 
  \u201e good evening budapest ! '', 
  well , it is close to russia . 
   torn down more than 20 years ago . 
  sure , the division made sense during the east-west split after wwii , but that 's the past . 
  and not a very long one , for that matter . 
  that 's not how it looks east of said curtain . 
  communism left a strong mark here . 
  it may not feel relevant to you , but it still is to a whole lot of people . 
  brushing it off like that seems a bit childish tbh . 
   it 's strange though to say austria is western european , whereas e.g. 
  czech republic or slovenia are eastern european , even more so considering both prague and ljubiljana are to the west of vienna . 
  not that strange when you take into account the iron curtain, 
  that 's because \u201e central europe '' is a cultural-geographic label ( mitteleuropa and all that ) while \u201e eastern europe '' has a geopolitical-historic dimention to it ( basically \u201e former communist europe '' ) rather than a strict geographic label . 
  a relic of the cold war when everything was about east vs. west . 
  they are not mutually exclusive . 
  dammit !, 
  [ from the frontpage thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1cxjw9/animalrights_activists_wreak_havoc_in_milan/ ) :  one of the comments on this article comes from one of the phd students working in that lab . 
  i have paraphrased what she says . 
   * `` what i really want to become clear is that we do think that animals have rights . 
  we do respect them , and treat them with as much precaution and attention as we can , often much more than what is legally required , in order to minimize their suffering and improve the quality of their lives . 
  we do try to use as less animals as is compatible with research aims and we work hard not to waste their lives . 
  finally , making this kind of attack does not help animals . 
  many of the stolen mice will die soon outside our facilities because they have a weaker immune system ( the ones that did n't die during the transport , since tens and tens of mice of both sexes were mixed up in boxes , and moreover as much animals will be needed to compensate their loss to make the reasearch go on . 
  * comment removed *, 
  one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  thank you for taking the time to write this . 
   th long term effects of this agreement , if ever put into action ( very questionable ) will most likely be a lot more negative than positive for the region . 
  could you expand on what the possible effects might be , both positive and negative ? 
  depends on the village . 
  berettyoszentmarton ( near ro/hu border ) does n't look depressing at all . 
  this reminds of how the bosnian serbs killed the vance-owen accord in bosnia , although everybody was for it , including milosevic . 
  well , it was n't erased by the mods , i can tell you that . 
  potato . 
  same in romanian . 
  used to be gruzia , now it 's georgia . 
  [ flags now available , inshallah ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1cqvw7/ocflag_for_the_islamic_republic_of_czechia/ ), 
  not an islamic republic, 
   f i go to a store in that `` yellow '' area over there in romania , and i ask in romanian to buy something , i 'll be turned down for not being hungarian . 
  no you wo n't  demanding that residents of a country should speak that country 's language is not nationalist bullshit !, 
  you were n't demanding anything . 
  you were being a nationalist asshole . 
  your first word in your first comment was an ethnic slur . 
   irelevant . 
   should i go ahead and assume that they speak serbian ? 
  or maybe armenian ? 
  you should go ahead and investigate . 
  i put every language down once , even if a language is n't a continuum . 
  that 's why i did ' t write the english word over ireland . 
  this is not a map about politics . 
   that particular yellow spot would have a reason to exist if it contained an actual word that is being used in that particular region . 
  it has a reason to exist because the area speaks another language . 
  the same reason other linguistic areas are shown in different countries . 
  sami areas , turkish areas in bulgaria , ossetian , karelian , kalmyk in russia , catalan , basque and galician in spain , welsh , and so on . 
   you just made that yellow spot there for not apparent reason i did n't `` make it '' , it was on the [ base map ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:simplified_languages_of_europe_map.svg ) and it was there for a reason . 
  this is not a map of official languages , but one of mother tongue . 
  the fact that some people get paranoid at the mere hint that there are hungarian speakers in romania is not my problem . 
  deal !, 
  [ details of the proposal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1cog11/kosovo_and_serbia_reach_eu_deal/c9iieox ), 
  fuckin ' finally !, 
  also , nice scarf on the baroness . 
  thank you for the translation . 
   i did a similar map for animal names once , perhaps i can find it somewhere . 
  uuuu . 
  please find it . 
  that would be interesting !, 
   there 's nothing equivalent ( yet ) for the eu ; [ there is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism ) , but in its early stages i 'd say . 
  but you 're right . 
  what we need is a common narrative . 
  that 's why there is a white border between the irish ( gaelic ) areas and the english areas . 
  but each language gets mentioned only once .
