  for the sake of aesthetic coherence , i sacrificed your silly little rule , 
  * narant * in north-east italy is friulian, 
  in estonian as well . 
  i fucked that up . 
  [ kalmyk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmyk_language ) . 
  nowhere near bulgaria actually . 
  actually , i was thinking about just that . 
  maybe in a few days or so , 
  where exactly does your extended family live in the east ? 
  alde , probably . 
  i would n't vote for them on the home front , given their current leadership , but if they keep [ renate weber ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/39713/renate_weber_home.html ) as a top candidate for mep , they 've got my vote . 
  how widespread is that ? 
  [ this ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:simplified_languages_of_europe_map.svg ), 
  the idea is that the * route * influences the word . 
  so the same word taking 2 different routes might end up looking simmilar , but not identical , as all the stops along the route change it a little bit . 
  think about the fact that \u201e shah '' ( of iran ) , \u201e check '' ( as in checkbook ) and \u201e chess '' ( the game ) come from the same persian \u201e root '' but have taken different \u201e routes '' to reach english . 
   i think the etymological root is actually the same , since the fruit is named after the country , not necessarily . 
  the fruit name might have come via turkish and greek , while the country name might have entered the same language via some other language , like church slavonic , or latin , or german . 
  scots does , [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/oranger ), 
  via the ottoman empire i would assume, 
  posts that portray islam as a cultural risk are not moderated . 
  posts that use blanket statements to portray all muslims as savages and so on are . 
  there is no islamofilia , but there is anti-xenophobia ( for lack of a better word ) . 
  variation most likely with all . 
  the etymologicla route is probably different for the two words . 
  romanian : * portugalia * ( country ) , * portocal\u0103 * ( fruit ), 
  ladin , piedmontese and neapulitan have different words for orange than standard italian ( maybe other refgional dialects/languages as well ), 
  * apelsin *, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_ ( fruit ) #etymology colors : 1a . 
  ** light orange ** - derived from the sanskrit word for `` orange tree '' ( * n\u0101ra\u1e45ga * ) , probably of dravidian origin 1b . 
  ** darker orange ** - variation on the above , via old french * pomme d'orenge * 2 \\ . 
  ** purple ** - `` apple from china '' , it alludes to the eastern origin of the fruit 3 \\ . 
  ** green ** - named after portugal , as portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange in europe 4 \\ . 
  ** various ** - other etymologies small text means a regional language ( friulian , silezian , occitan , scots , etc ) . 
  any comments are welcome . 
  ** edit ** errors so far : - estonian - serbian, 
  yes 2 . 
  i ca n't say about other mods , but i have looked into how/what other mods are doing . 
  i do n't remember anything objectionable to be honest . 
  somebody should nuke 1913 's vienna, 
   though maybe they 're censoring stuff spam , ad hominems and racism .

  as long as the noise is at an acceptable level , i see no problem with this . 
  this i no different than church bells on sunday morning . 
  although i bet a lot less people will be hung over when the muslims start making the call to prayer . 
  i love how they turned a discussion which should have been about acceptable level of noise vs. unacceptable level of noise into islam vs. europe .

  as a romanian , where party ideology means nothing , i 'm not surprised by this . 
  the minister of culture , and [ liberal party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_liberal_party_%28romania%29 ) senate leader just said this about the gays :  `` i have nothing to reproach them [ the homosexuals ] , they 're just ill people . 
  homosexuality is not a natural state , it 's not a natural relationship , which is why , in my opinion , this initiative [ i.e. 
  the legalization of civil partnerships ] has absolutely no chance '' also , a social-democrat party leader had this to say about the initiator of a bill for a law ending the public financing of churches : `` he 's an idiot '' and `` i 'm going to break his legs if i catch him in constanta '',

  there are also the so called irish travellers , which are a local irish gypsy-like minority, 
  more like gypsies imo . 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  * facepalm * as a wise man put it : `` it 's not a proper balkan party if you do n't manage to piss off at least two of your neighbours ! '', 
  my 2 eurocents : i think the us , playing safe in macedonia might be blocking a golden opportunity to put an end to this kosovo business . 
  i hate nationalism as much as possible , but i feel we have to be pragmatic about this . 
  kosovo is an ethnic issues , and as such , it should be dealt with as an ethnic issue . 
  we can put 10 or 20 stars on the kosovo flag , truth is , kosovo is an albanian state , and it was created when a bunch of albanians wanted independence from the serbians . 
  it 's the same data , but broken down on different [ eu territorial-statistical subdivisions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics ) .

  the redder the more deaths compared to births . 
  red is not `` bad '' and green is not `` good '' - though i would prefer living somewhere births being more frequent than deaths . 
   enjoy , raffael ( www.joyofdata.de ), 
  i 'm sure the only reason we 're no . 
  1 is because albania or moldova are not on the list . 
  interesting . 
   i just wish the gypsy community would get its shit together , send the kids to school , go to work and if the only work you can do is manual labour then do that instead of living completely on benefits and the money the kids beg together . 
  well a lot of them work on shitty jobs ( low-level manual labor ) . 
  but yeah , i too wish this whole circle of causes and so on changes . 
  there 's enough child poverty among the non-gypsies too , in rural areas for example . 
  slovakia has a higher percentage of gypsies but a lower percentage of child poverty . 
  latvia has a negligeable gypsy population , and is quite close to us as percentages of child poverty go . 
  true , there does seem to be a shift in north-west europe towards the pro-israel camp , and it 's quite interesting , tbh . 
  keep it civil . 
  * edited, 
   did you know that the majority of jews are not even semites ? 
  yes they are  do you even know what the word `` anti-semitic '' means ? 
  yes , it means something else than it 's exact etymology . 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisemitism  hostility toward or discrimination against jews as a religious , ethnic , or racial group also , see : [ etymological fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymological_fallacy ), 
  not necessarily . 
  the far-right in europe seems to be partially morphing into something that 's pro-israel and anti-muslims . 
  literally a majority !, 
  to add to this . 
  the turkish population is generally taken together with the tatar , as these are the ones that are the traditional muslim minorities of romania .
