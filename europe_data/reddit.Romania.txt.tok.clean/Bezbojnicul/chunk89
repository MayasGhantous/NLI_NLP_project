  i remember , about 10 years ago , the official spokesman for the romanian army was an ethnic turk . 
  despite half our history being about us vs the evil ottomans/turks , there is virtually no resentment over medieval times . 
  there has been some recent immigration , but nothing big . 
  peanuts compared to western europe . 
  also , our mufti is on the liberal side , but he has been complaining recently about the influx of saudi ideas . 
  ( all of the balkans have this clash between moderate `` turkish '' islam and extremist `` arab '' islam ) . 
  interesting . 
   they did n't publish all a disclaimer : `` from now on we 'll call them young males , but you should know they 're gypsy '' . 
  well obviously . 
  i meant i did n't notice it being used . 
  mainstream . 
  well , besides the [ manele ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manele ) singers , there is : [ connect-r ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gllcmb1fje ) ( this was last summers hit ) , [ \u0218tefan b\u0103nic\u0103 jr. ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9z_hntcjwg ) ( of roma descent , sort of a romanian elvis-light , but do not confuse with [ elvis rromano ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjsxcy9b82u ) ) and the late [ johnny r\u0103ducanu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwbqthw74h0 ) there are also : [ marcel pavel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqa-h57aeik ) ( just found out , but he 's sort of a one-hit wonder ) and [ pepe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knbr1s-og4w ) , but i 'd say their succes is limited . 
   some 7-8 years ago , the romanian media started calling the roma delinquents as `` young males '' , due to outside pressure . 
  it got so bad that when they got to the pictures of these young males , they were 40 something , looking like they were 60 ... :-) . 
  ok , this news to me . 
  ( but then again i watch little tv ), 
  `` negru '' ( black ) is used coloquially , and is not offensive , but the press uses `` de culoare '' ( of colour ) [ ** edit ** calling somebody * coloured * \u201e colorat '' is offensive though . 
  at least it 's not neutral , but mocking in tone , and it most of the time refers to roma , not blacks * / edit * ] `` romi '' ( roma ) is used instead of `` tigani '' ( gypsies ) and are usually the only ones whose ethnicity tends to be mentioned . 
  when a romanian citizen of hungarian ethnicity does something illegal abroad , they are usually reffered to only as `` the romanian citizen '' or simply `` the romanian '' ( cetateanul roman , romanul ) , even though you know by name he 's a hungarian . 
  also , there is the standard assumption that `` clanuri de interlopi '' ( gangster clans ) reffers to `` roma clans '' . 
  also `` minoritari '' ( of the minority ) is used sometimes , refering to roma , and in colloquial speach ( not tv ) , `` etnici minoritari '' ( minority ethnics ) . 
  we have little immigrants , so we just call them immigrants , or illegal imigrants ( if they are caught at the border for example ) .

  people generally say that the '80s were the north korea period , but the '60s and '70s were quite ok ( for the average joe , not for intelectuals and so on ) . 
  an internal poll done in 2010 :  * 61 % of romanian consider communism a good idea , compared to 53 % four years ago . 
   * 49 % of romanians state that life before december 1989 was better in romania , while only 23 % think it was worst , and 14 % think it was the same . 
   * ceausescu romania did good to romania ( 25 % ) is significantly higher than of those who claim he hurt the country ( 15 % )  * 25 % said communism was a bad idea , 12 % preferred not to answer , 47 % said it was a good idea , but poorly implemented  * negative aspects of communism were lack of freedom ( 9 % ) , dictatorship ( 7 % ) , the wrongness of the system ( 5 % ) , terror and murder ( 2 % ) and poverty ( 2 % ) . 
   * positive aspects : all men had a job ( 62 % ) , a decent standard of living ( 26 % ) , housing ( 19 % ) , safety of tomorrow ( 12 % ) , good wages ( 7 % ) , free and quality education , plus equality ( 4 % ) .

  two years ago , the polling firm found that 44 percent of romanians favored a restoration of the communist regime . 
  i hope this is n't read as a comment supporting communism . 
  rather , it is a critique on what followed after '89 in bulgaria . 
  it 's exactly the same case with the polls cited in the article . 
   would it then be okay for hungary to strip every romanian ethnic from their hungarian citizenship ? 
  even better question : would it then be okay for moldova to strip the moldovan citizenship from the moldavians who went and got a romanian citizenship ? 
   romania should apply the same restrictions as slovakia . 
  we ca n't . 
  article 5 , subsection 2 of the romanian constitution : http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0a5  ( 2 ) romanian citizenship can not be withdrawn if acquired by birth . 
  hungary had an opinion about what happens in romania since ' 90 , given how there is a significant hungarian minority round here . 
  also do n't equate autonomy with separatism . 
  and no , it 's not bad , and the slovak state was a douchebag . 
  imagine people from moldova losing moldovan citizenship the second they aquire the romanian one . 
  or should we stop meddling in \u201e moldova 's internal affairs '' as well ? 
  ahhh , greek !, 
  or as i like to call it , deja vu language !, 
  seriously . 
  half the words you already know from more complex words in your language . 
  the word for sky ? 
  ouranos [ uranus , the ancient sky god ] the word for \u201e exit '' on the roads ? 
  exodos [ exodus ] the word for marriage ? 
  gamou [ think poli * gamy * ] and on and on it goes ... 
   but they do n't have a bermudian flag ya want one ? 
  i can hook you up !, 
  ^ ^ ^ [ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ price ! ], 
  you half-magyar 'd him , 
   you ca n't get it without at least being able to speak some little level of hungarian with the citizenship officer . 
  in some villages in eastern hungary you can submit the papers without knowing hungarian ( like , if a friend comes and translates ) . 
  you just have to know which villages . 
   source : i live in oradea/nagyv \u00e1rad and know of people who did this . 
   macedonian is a close cousin of serbian and shares many similarities with bulgarian . 
  afaik macedonian is closer to bulgarian than serbian . 
   although i do n't really speak the language . 
  that might not be a big problem . 
  i heard you can get citizenship even if you do n't speak the language . 
   however , applicants from serbia or the ukraine have economic gains as well romania as well . 
  a lot of young people have applied because romania still has a lot of restrictions on work and so on . 
  not to mention the pain of getting a usa visa . 
  all your flairs are lies !!, 
  \u201e am creioane \u00een buzunar '' or if i want to go full western dialect ( strongly influenced by hungarian ) : \u201e am \u021beruze-n jeb '' ( but no-one i met uses \u201e \u021beruze '' anymore ), 
  that 's exactly why i said that the list goes on and on ... 
  `` we '' are morally evolved europeans `` they '' are culturally backward muslims , evil gypsies who only want to steal and the list goes on and on and on ... 
   almost everyone hates the turks except romanians ( if one considers them balkan ) , even though 50 % of romanian history is `` us vs the turks '', 
  afaik it 's actually the size of the river that 's a better indicator of etymology . 
  big rivers tend to have old ( dacian and so on ) etymologies , medium size rivers tend to have slavic etymologies . 
   in other words : crossing the border from romania to hungary does n't seem like crossing the border . 
  the houses look the same , the people look the same , everything looks the same and this can be confirmed by anyone who did this . 
  if you cross the border towards bulgaria though , you do notice differences . 
  for one , the language . 
  then the houses seem to have a slightly different architecture . 
  the differences are n't big but they are there . 
  there are differences when you cross fro hungary to romania , from transylvania to wallachia , and from romania to bulgaria . 
  i notice the least amount of difference at the last crossing , tbh . 
   as most of the balkan peninsula is [ slavic ] equating balkan with slavic is really simplistic . 
  half the balkans are not slavic . 
   nothing personal , but i take it from this response that you have n't done a lot of travelling , i would say that romania is more latin with some slavic mixed in . 
  it has a significant slavic cultural influence . 
  i 'd say bulgaria is closer culturally than catalunya or northern italy . 
   current population figured do n't mean anything . 
  you should rather check how many muslims were living in romania in 1600 . 
  there was never a significant muslim population in what is now romania , except in dobrudzha . 
   hungary also has significant balkanic influences . 
  much weaker than romania . 
   romania borders the balkan region , geographically , culturally and politically . 
  it may border it geographically , but it is culturally a balkan country . 
   culturally , romania is of latin heritage and not slavic i really hate how we tend to equate language with culture . 
  that 's only a fragment of culture . 
  romanian culture has more in comon with bulgarians and greeks than with catalans . 
   it can even be observed today , for example , 10 % of bulgaria is muslim of turkish origin . 
  romania has no muslim influences and has the lowest number of muslims in the whole of europe .
