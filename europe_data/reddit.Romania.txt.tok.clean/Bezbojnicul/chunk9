   ( i know it is n't the right chart type but excel seems picky about having names as an axis-label ) . 
  if you send me the excel file , i can make a more suitable chart . 
  well , i stopped when / u/dngrs took over . 
  i could resume , if you guys want . 
  infantry regiment became prisoner of war 1915 september 3 was here october 16 second image is too damaged to read ( and i have a feeling it might be in another language , maybe one which uses cyrillic ) . 
  did [ some digging ] ( http://www.austro-hungarian-army.co.uk/infdev.htm ) , and it seems that 1 ^ st infantry regiment was silesian german , so it might be the 101 ^ th infantry regiment , which was made up of hungarians .

  ** turkey ** - nice country . 
  been to alanya back in the early 2000 's , and plan on spending my honeymoon in istanbul in september . 
  ** turks ** - nice and welcoming people in general , found them similar to the greeks in their attitude , although that is something that neither people will probably admit . 
  some in western europe might be a bit rough around the edges , from what i heard . 
  the ones in romania are a-ok , both the historical minority , and the more recent immigrants . 
  ** eu membershit ** - as long as turkey fulfills all the criteria . 
  ** erdogan ** - seems like an asshole , with autocratic reflexes tbh , and i especially dislike his political religiosity . 
  otoh , i think improving kurdish rights , opening up towards armenia , and removing the ban on headscarves in public buildings were the right thing to do . 
  ** ataturk ** - as a historical figure , he seems badass ( read [ a biography ] ( http://books.google.ro/books/about/atat%c3%bcrk_f%c4%83uritorul_turciei_moderne.html?id=y3qgpgaacaaj&amp;redir_esc=y ) on the guy and was impresed with him ) , but i think turkey has an ataturk-fetish . 
  the personality cult around him is disturbing and unhealthy , tbh , because i feel that it hinders re-evaluation of some of his ideas ( i think some parts kemalism need to be seriously re-evaluated ) . 
   most of them wanted to leave . 
  so did most of everybody else . 
   and we do n't like ideas of separatism or even giving autonomy but we do largely like serbs . 
  so maybe people would be somewhat in favor , if they knew about the issue ( but they do n't ) . 
   it 's the busy body mod that 's been here all of 11 days talking like he knows anything . 
  i would have done the same ( and have so in the past ) . 
   representing 750 million people . 
  more like 500 million, 
  i doubt it will happen tbh . 
  [ burebista ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burebista ) happened . 
  [ statue ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/burebista_statue_in_calarasi.jpg ) he united the dacians and the getae , kicked some celtic ass in the west ( [ transylvania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celts_in_transylvania ) and beyond ) , some roman and greek ass in the south . 
  apparently caesar was planing to come kick his ass because he sided with pompei in the civil war ( but the plans got canceled because of a hostile senate ) . 
  he also burned the grape-vines allegedly ( i 've heard a theory that it was because there was a competition between the local religion which used cannabis to get intoxicated , and a competing religion , a dyonisiac cult from further south , that used alcohol - i.e. 
  wine ) . 
  burebista 's image was used a lot by the ceau\u0219escu 's nationalist-communist regime , and there is still a lot of bad history surrounding that period . 
  other than that , we had some greek colonies on the black sea coast ( histria , tomis , callatis ) , last two of which still stand as cities today ( constan\u021ba and mangalia ) . 
   renzi sent a letter to the commission president-elect to confirm his choice of mogherini to become the next italian eu commissioner . 
  he specified that mogherini is their `` candidate for the high representative '' job . 
  oh , this is gon na be interesting . 
  a bit of drama on the high representative post . 
  i do n't know who votes , but : [ g!tranlated from here ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-17686616-cum-isi-romania-stangul-dreptul-nominalizarea-comisarului-european-surse-procedurile-interne-neindeplinite-guvernul-ponta-eterna-cearta-presedinte-premier-subrezesc-pozitia-negociere.htm )  regarding the high representative - which is basically european foreign minister - romania rallied to the position of the eastern europeans who want to get to a representative therea . 
  [ ... ] `` we would like the high representative for foreign policy to be a representative of the eastern countries '' - said president traian basescu , at departure to brussels . 
   the european press has indicated that variants for this position on the bulgarian kristlina georgieva and polish radoslaw sikorski , of the eastern bloc and the italian federica mogherini in the western part of the eu . 
   and here comes a divergence between pm ponta and president basescu , regarding romania 's position , something that could weaken the bargaining position of the country . 
  if basescu already expressed his option for a representative of the eastern countries , ponta shoots for italian mogherini , social democratic sources said for hotnews.ro . 
   georgieva is supported by the bulgarian opposition - gerb party of former prime minister boyko borisov , who is part of the european people 's party , that is a colleague of traian baescu in europe . 
  so is the polish radoslaw sikorski , who is a member of civic platform , of poland 's prime minister donald tusk , a member of the epp . 
   ponta , however , supports colleague and friend matteo renzi , premier of rome and the italian democratic party , which wants the post of eu foreign minister for mogherini . 
   also , things are tangled sofia to the bulgarian socialist party leader sergey stanishev says he does not support kristalina georgieva , given that he himself targets a commissioner post . 
  stanishev is president of the party of european socialists and a friend victor ponta - hence another reason for social democratic prime minister not to agree with basescu 's pledge of support for georgieva in the european council . 
   mogherini , which was in bucharest in late may , encounters the opposition of poland and the baltic states , which reproach the italian diplomat 's proximity to russia . 
  however from this point of view , bulgaria is also suspected of ties too close to moscow . 
  yeah , one of the economic portfolios would probably be best given to the uk . 
  we [ ee ] do n't really care about gender balance in general , tbh , and with russia in `` imperial mode '' , we care even less . 
   sikorski is very uksceptic `` ukskeptic '' in the sense that he sees the brexit as inveitable , not necessarily something desirable , afaict . 
   not much . 
  although my favorite candidate , i tend to agree that he probably wo n't get the job , being seen as too hawkish in the west ( i hope i 'm proven wrong ) . 
  an interesting alternative to both sikorski and mogherini seems to be [ dimitris avramopoulos , according to auractiv ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/greek-defence-minister-nominated-commissioner-303747 ) . 
   juncker plans to visit athens next week ( 4 august ) to hold talks on the forming of the new cabinet of the eu executive . 
  according to sources , athens would be interested in the internal affairs or immigration portfolios . 
  ** taking into account avramopoulos ' profile and experience , the post of eu foreign affairs chief as a compromise solution among western and eastern european countries is also a possibility . 
  eastern europe wo n't accept mogherini . 
  not with ukraine . 
  interesting . 
  always made me think of the phrase \u201e tax exemption '' ... 
  awesome idea !, 
  how about * \u201e what happened in your country in the * ** [ ... ] *** ^ th century ? '' * ... maybe have the first thread for bc , and than individual/groups of 2-3 centuries ( like \u201e i ^ st to iii ^ rd c. ad period '' ), 
   kinda related but does anyone here have the old pics from the rather funny trolls from about 1-2 years ago ? 
  `` pay denbts or else '' for example . 
  i miss the days when / u/txampion ( mr. \u201e greece , pay your debts ! '' ) was the only troll round here ... 
  i 'm all for it . 
  make it a wednesday thread , that was traditionally the day they were posted . 
  obligatory : * [ `` what do you know about ... 
  index ] ( / 1g16kp ) * [ `` which places should you visit in ... 
  index ] ( / 1rxjpx ) * [ `` what happened in your country this week ? '', 
  index ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week ) also linked in the sidebar . 
  it initially referred to the roma , but in some places , the meaning expanded to unrelated groups with similar lifestyles ( irish travelers for example ), 
  a picture i took recently in the [ mo\u015fna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mo%c8%99na,_sibiu ) church 's small museum section : [ an old newspaper article ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4mxcvnu.jpg ), 
   ) you sir , just made my day !, 
   france should make schools for them in their native language like romania did separate roma schools were closed by pressure from the eu in the middle 00 's , in a push to de-segregate the education system . 
  see for example : [ this article ] ( http://stirile.rol.ro/print/-scolile-tiganesti-din-tara-desfiintate-prin-desegregare-509732.html ), 
   [ awaken , romanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de%c8%99teapt%c4%83-te,_rom%c3%a2ne ! ), 
  it 's ok , i guess . 
  but i think the last stanza should not be a default ( a bit too christian with the whole * `` priests , lead with your crucifixes , for our army is christian , '' * bit ) . 
  stanzas 1 , 2 and 4 are enough imo , as the 4th stanza ends with * '' < life in freedom or death !  shout all '' * which is a nice sentiment/statement . 
  beware the cabal !, 
   ahhhhhhhh how do i get a flag next to my name ? 
  on the right side : * show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like : * click on * edit * next to your name . 
  greece . 
   surprisingly , it 's not even mentioned in romanian history classes they mentioned it in my school . 
  for some reason it wo n't open for me ( neither at work or at home ) . 
  mirror ? 
  ** edit ** nevermind :  sometimes it 's the little things . 
  in 1989 , after failing to win a majority in the irish general election , charles j. haughey was forced to formally resign as taoiseach . 
  people forget this now , because haughey remained as acting taoiseach until fianna fail and the progressive democrats did the business and assembled a dail majority to re-elect him as taoiseach proper . 
    but it set an interesting precedent , because it means that in 2016 enda kenny could return to the dail with a mere 40-50 tds , and remain indefinitely as head of a fine gael minority government if there is not an agreed majority to replace him . 
  it 's not enough to lose the election : the dail has to agree on who actually won , and looking at the recent red c poll , that could be anybody 's guess . 
    all because of the haughey precedent of 27 years previously . 
    the little things matter , and the nomination of jean-claude juncker as president of the european commission is going to be another one of those things that will snowball into something much bigger in the future . 
    juncker was nominated in dublin last march by the european people 's party , the largest centre-right grouping in the european parliament , and the party of both angela merkel and enda kenny . 
  the socialists , liberals , greens and the left in the european parliament also nominated candidates . 
  all with the same understanding : that whichever party won the most seats would supply the next president of the commission .
