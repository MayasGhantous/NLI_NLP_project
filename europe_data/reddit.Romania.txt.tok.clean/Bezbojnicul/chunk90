  you can have turkish and turkic cultural influences even without a turkish-muslim population . 
   politically it was never involved in the so-called `` balkan wars '' nor did it have any conflicts with any of the neighbors . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_balkan_war ( see beligerents )  so , as it stands now , romania is no more a balkan country , just because it borders the balkans , than say , hungary . 
  this is extremely laughable . 
  hungary is in almost every way central european , culturally speaking . 
  romania is a mix of eastern , central and balkan , but because the capital is in the south , the area with the most balkan influences , i 'd say the balkan influence is the strongest . 
  you 're really stretching the definition of colony . 
  i think dobrogea is the only thing remotely resembling a romanian colony , but it never went independent . 
  maybe rep. of moldova too . 
  sort of . 
   romanians from the carpathians assimilated the local slavs living in the plains afaik , slavic toponyms are distributed rather equally regardless of altitude/geography . 
  that makes the picture you paint rather inaccurate . 
  that 's like calling anyone from the british isles english , because most are english , even if some are from the rep. o ' ireland, 
   ravni kotari ( croatia , near zadar ) has always been croatia and never been serbian and was also the cradle of the medieval croatian kingdom ( knin was also a capital at one point , but that 's a really 50-50 / iffy area ) . 
  i just think that some ethnic populations would have to remain outside of their own states for practical and historical reasons . 
  i see . 
  but these historical reasons exist in other areas too . 
  western romania ( transylvania ) and areas that are now slovakia were until the 20th century extremely important areas for hungary . 
  bratislava was even a capital once if i 'm not mistaken . 
  then there is kosovo . 
  and so on . 
  sometimes i think ethnic realities must trump history for pragmatic reasons . 
   i think you 'd endear yourself to quite a few dalmatians . 
  how so ? 
   it completely disregards historical administrative divisions in mixed ethnicity areas care to elaborate ? 
  i 'm not really sure what you mean . 
   but deporting those who were illegally brought in by a foreign invasion and their children . 
   turkey 's act of colonizing was more like ethnic cleansing . 
  i really do n't care which is * more like ethnic cleansing * . 
  i 'd rather there be nothing of the likes . 
   and there should be a population transfer : all the mainland turkish families who were brought to cyprus to colonize it should be expelled from cyprus ( though this may shock some of you , this kind of population exchange has already been done between greece and turkey , and of course with other ethnicites like germans after ww2 , israeli colonists leaving gaza etc. . ) . 
  ethnic turkish cypriots who were on the island before turkish invasion should be allowed to stay . 
  how about we apply the baltic solution . 
  let them ( turkish colonists ) stay and make them reapply for citizenship . 
  i 'm really not so fond of ethnic cleansing . 
   a degree of autonomy for the constituent ethnic groups was crucial and the best way to ensure that was a federation . 
  how about this : http://i.imgur.com/lk2u9jf.jpg it is molded on ethnic teritories . 
  italic regions are autonomous areas ( dalmatia for example is an autonomous exclave of croatia , bihac and sandzak for bosnia , krajna for serbia , besides kosovo and vojvodina . ), 
  im not claiming its the best solution ( maybe there are geographic objections ) , but its still better than having a mini-yugoslavia ( bih ) in the middle as a constituent state . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  hell , give them independence if that 's what they want . 
  he either should have abolished the states altogether and made one single yugoslav state , or he should have made ethnic states . 
  his setup was a disaster waiting to happen . 
   i would be for dividing it back up between ethnic lines , it would solve a lot of problems . 
  true . 
  tito should have carved up yugoslavia into ethnic constituent republics . 
  that way when it broke up , it would n't have done so with all the bloodshed . 
  they are not involved in kosovo , but under the same principle of self-determination , they should be allowed to have an independence referendum . 
  afaik , they are not to fond of the bosnian state . 
   how come republika srpska ( 2m ppl , 98 % serbs ) never got the chance of referendum from eu ?!, 
  they should . 
   kosovo should be recognized as a legitimate state seperate from serbia . 
  agreed , but north kosovo should get a referendum , whether they want to remain part of kosovo or serbia . 
  keeping them in kosovo by force is a recipe for disaster . 
  we also have transnistria . 
  also abkhazia and south ossetia and nagorno-karabakh if you consider the south caucasus to be in europe . 
  :( apparently information is scarce . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.vipmagazin.md/top/numele_la_moldoveni._ion_forever/ ) says the most common surname is ` rusu ' , and the [ statistcs office says ] ( http://www.stare-civila.gov.md/pages/statistica-2008#14 ) that the most common surname for kids born in 2008 is the same , so it sort of confirms the first link . 
  ok , piggybacking on your comment some more info on romanian surnames : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_name also , interesting as regional trait :  the ending - ei , usually preceded by a - in front of a female name , is a latin inherited female genitive , like in amariei `` of maria '' , aelenei `` of elena '' . 
  these matrilineal-rooted surnames are common in the historical region of moldavia . 
  and of ourse , transylvania has a lot of surnames of hungarian origin . 
  here 's a list : http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:romanian_names_of_hungarian_origin, 
  russian word for godless , romanianized . 
  an alternative soviet word for ` atheist ' that never really gained any ground in the romanian language . 
  the first atheist literature i came in contact with ( in the late 90 's , before the new atheist wave ) was [ yemelian iaroslavski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yemelyan_yaroslavsky ) 's books ( translated into romanian in the '60s ) . 
  he also had a magazine in the ussr , called [ bezbozhnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bezbozhnik_ ( magazine \\ ) ) . 
  when i decided to create an atheist blog , i though the name fitting . 
  [ he was obviously romanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk%3anikola_tesla/nationality_and_ethnicity ) / jk, 
   were the assumptions to hold something tells me they wo n't  foreign workers will `` change national identity '' would n't be the first time in the british isles ( ignoring the anachronicity of talking about ` national identity ' pre 19th c. ) . 
  1066/nevar forgeth !, 
  also by 2066 some of the white others will be assimilated in to `` white british '' . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_sxzooexyq ) is golden as well !, 
  half my coworkers have monday off for catholic easter . 
  the other half have it off whenever orthodox easter is . 
  as long as it 's the same number of days for each community , there should be no problems . 
  the romanian orthodox church has new style christmas and old style easter . 
  so christmas falls on the same day as the western one . 
  but i do know of mixed serbian-romanian families who have 2 christmases , 
   it 's monacans or monegasque, 
  awesome . 
  reading articles like like this makes me wish i had pursued a career related to history !, 
  hungarians in romania get days of for easter on different dates than romanians , because western christian easter falls on a different date from orthodox easter . 
  we even have a euroredditor from there, 
  they need to have something reflective on the back so they are visible at night and speeding cars do n't suddenly hit a cart in the dark from behind . 
  used plates are nailed to the end of the cart because they are reflective . 
  we 're working on it . 
  these bans are just silly . 
  a lot of foodstuffs are regional . 
   we greeks have a lot of turkish words as well , especially food related romanians as well . 
  a good chunk of food names come from the balkans . 
  yeah , but you can understand the meaning from context . 
  even writing with an english keyboard . 
  then they will be changed , then vandalized again ... after a while , people will get used to the bilingual signs and the ` vandals ' will give up . 
  same thing happened in romania a decade ago with romanian + hungarian signs . 
   you should all adopt the greek alphabet ; after all , cyrillic and latin are its child systems . 
  let 's go directly to phoenician . 
  [ werther effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/werther_effect ), 
  yep , shit 's crazy ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_turanism#turanism_and_hungarian_fascism  the leader of the hungarian fascist arrow cross party , ferenc sz\u00e1lasi , believed in the existence of a `` turanian-hungarian '' race ( which included jesus christ ) . 
  the idea was a key part of his ideology of `` hungarism '' . 
  in hungary some fascists ( and non-fascists ) tried to link the ancestors of the hungarians to timur , the ottomans and japan , which some hungarians of the 1930s described as the ` other sword of turan ' ( the first sword being hungary ) .
