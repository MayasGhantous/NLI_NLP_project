  [ ... ]  many christian hungarian turanists held the view that jesus christ was not a jew but a proto-hungarian or a `` noble of parthia '' . 
  the theory of `` jesus , the parthian prince '' are such , or the revivification of real or supposed elements of priest-magicians of ancient `` magic '' middle-eastern world , shamanism , and pagan ancient hungarian religion . 
  also some muslim turkish turanists held the view that muhammad was not an arab but a sumerian , and sumerians are turanid according to turanist theses . 
  it is an opportunity for the christian turanists to link jesus christ to the ancient middle-eastern mystery and the ancient pagan hungarian beliefs . 
  both catholic and protestant religious leaders of hungary acted against this theory and beliefs . 
  i know , but starting each sentence with * `` hypothetically speaking ... '' * might be a bit annoying . 
  [ nope , it does n't ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1aecu0/traces_of_pork_in_halal_sausages_at_london_schools/c8wo1ql ), 
   pork is forbidden in christianity christianity is not synonymous with biblical literalism . 
  that is a very neo-protestant/evangelical point of view . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_views_on_the_old_covenant  although christianity affirms that the pentateuch is part of scripture that is inspired of god , christian tradition , in this case similar to jewish tradition , denies that all of the old covenant still applies directly to christians , but different arguments are used to reach that conclusion and there are differences of opinion within christianity as to which parts , if any , still apply . 
  the predominant christian view is that jesus mediates a new covenant relationship between god and his followers , according to the new testament , which ended or set aside some or all of the old covenant . 
  this includes mosaic dietary restrictions . 
   christianity opriginated in the same place as judaism and islam and it quickly migrated from the palestinian countryside to the graeco-roman cities of the east , while at the same time abandoning judaic dietary restrictions . 
  that being said , i agree that it might be more than just geography . 
  the canaanites surrounding the ancient israelites used to raise pigs . 
  actually , the presence of pig bones is a method used by archaeologists to distinguish israelite sites from non-israelite ones , iirc . 
   so you 've been eating pork and nobody noticed , shame on you !, 
  now what ? 
  nothing , actually . 
  because :  chapter ( sura ) 2 - verse ( ayat ) 173 al-baqara ( the cow )  `` he has forbidden you only the maitah ( dead animals ) , and blood , and the flesh of swine , and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah . 
  but if one is forced by necessity , ** without wilful disobedience , ** nor transgressing due limits , ** then there is no sin on him . 
  ** truly , allah is oft-forgiving most merciful . '', 
   to deny it 's an issue is disingenuous i do n't think anybody is denying it . 
  people are arguing over the root causes and about each side 's share of the responsibility . 
   my point was that many of them arrived at that time actually , they had arrived earlier , in the 13th-14th century . 
  that 's when the first wave of roma arrived in europe . 
   is it possible that this coin also has two sides never said it did n't . 
  but just saying that they do not want to integrate and leaving it at that is useless . 
   the majority of gypsies just do n't want to integrate any hard data to back this statement up ? 
  i feel so uneuropean when you say this . 
   at the same time , for that century , it was quite progressive what she did . 
  for that century . 
  do you consider it progressive for this century ? 
   how come that there were never any issues with the german minority ( `` sv\u00e1bok '' who were respected before , during and after the world wars ) ? 
  the swabians were never viewed and treated as an underclass . 
   and a lot of them became great artists so did a lot of roma  you should see typical gypsy 's home do you mean [ gypsy palaces ] ( http://www.rozylowicz.com/retirement/kastellos/kastellos.html ) ? 
  [ adobe houses ] ( http://www.cultureandconflict.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/valea_rece.jpg ) ? 
  blocks of flats ? 
  normal looking houses ? 
  romania has gypsies living in all of the above , and them palaces are the only things unique to the roma , as an architectural style , but the act of building flashy villas is hardly unique to them . 
  yeah , that worked so well in the past ... 
   it ca n't be the fault of the bigots that reject them at every turn . 
  there are many sides to this issue . 
  some roma populations are quite insular . 
  not saying there is n't a shitton of xenophobia . 
  i think the closest they 've been to integration was in communist eastern europe . 
  that 's generally speaking . 
  on the other hand there are various types of roma assimilated or integrated to various degrees . 
  mary theresa guaranteed their rights . 
  http://ling.uni-graz.at/~rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml  the fourth decree issued in 1773 prohibited marriages between roma . 
  mixed marriages were encouraged by subsidies . 
  the permission to get married , however , was bound to an attestation of `` a proper way of life and knowledge of the catholic religious doctrine '' . 
  since the empress and her counselors were of the opinion that the `` civilization '' of the `` gypsies `` was the basis for a successful `` domiciliation '' , she ordered that all children over the age of five should be taken away from their parents and be handed over to a hungarian farmer 's family who were supposed to take charge of their christian upbringing against payment . 
  the children should grow up isolated from their own parents in different comitats , go to school and later learn a trade or become farmers . [ ... ], 
   for the use of the `` gypsy language '' , for example , the law provided a flogging with 24 blows . 
  despite the sanctions ordered in case of offences , the coercive measures imposed by maria theresia and joseph ii were effective only to a certain degree . [ ... ],

   sa\u0219i ( sash < sachs ) from german `` saschen '' - saxons  the ( slavic ) term nem\u021bi for germans has mostly given way to germani . 
  i 'd say * neamt * is still dominant , at least in colloquial speach . 
   hungarians are called alternatively unguri and maghiari . 
  nuance : * ungur * can mean both ethnic hungarians , and , more specifically , hungarians from hungary . 
  * maghiari * is usually just the former .

   wait , does my constant hurling of invectives and threats of physical violence ( with a large poleaxe ) towards you have anything to do with these comments ? 
  i would bet it was the other parts of your comments - the argument parts - that had an influence ( if it 's the case ) .

  [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) is dead . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  in case of an administrative reorganisation , parts of mures county ( not all of it , just some hungarian areas ) might be included in a szekler autonomous region . 
  the szekler project does not include the romanian speaking areas of mures in it . 
  given how counties will be merged and redrawn into `` regions '' , there is noting to prevent the split of mures into 2 parts , one merged into szekler region , the other into `` transylvania/cluj/whatever region '' .
