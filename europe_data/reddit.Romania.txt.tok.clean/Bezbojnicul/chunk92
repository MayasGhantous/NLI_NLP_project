  who gets to answer ? 
  if you make it nationwide , the romanian majority will crush the autonomy . 
  a recent poll , iirc , stated that about 75 % of romanians think the hungarian minority already has too many rights . 
  on the other hand , i 'd be curios to see how many szeklers are in favour of autonomy . 
  i know there is a chunck who really do n't care about the issue . 
  a referendum in the 3 szekler counties would probably pass , but would generate a lot of resentment on the parts of the romanian majority . 
  yeah , the presence of the [ hvim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-four_counties_youth_movement ) and [ jobbik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ) members , as well as the [ denouncing of trianon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dm8ash0.jpg ) ^ [ image ^ from ^ last ^ fall ] are really not helping their cause . 
  yeah , the [ act of union of 1918 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alba_iulia_national_assembly#alba_iulia_national_assembly ) , voted on by the representatives of romanians living in austria-hungary said that :  full national freedom for all the co-inhabiting peoples . 
  each of the peoples will educate itslef , administer itself and judge itself in its own language through individuals of its own kind and each people will get the right to be represented in the legislative bodies and in the government of the country in accordance with the number of its people . 
  but after the union the government in bucharest said `` fuck the transylvanians ' wishes '' and instead of a more decentralised system , it went with full centralisation . 
  not until after ww2 did the hungarians get an autonomous region : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_autonomous_region the romanians are borderline paranoid , given how important `` unity '' is to the national narrative , and how the ghosts of [ irredentism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award ) still haunt some people ( not to mention the nationalist tone comming from budapest , as well as the nationalist elements among the hungarian minority ) . 
  a lot of romanians still think that `` autonomy '' is just one step away from independence . 
  and the hungarian politicians have done a shitty job explaining the details of what this desired autonomy would mean exactly , and why romanians need ( or not ) to chill the fuck out . 
  i 'm not really sure the szeklers will get their autonomous region with the upcoming administrative reorganisation , to be honest . 
  ** romania : ** - german veto over ** schengen ** . 
  who 's to blame , and what should we do about it ? 
  http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-bulgaria-rebuffed-from-schengen-space - autonomy in ** szekler land ** . 
  szeklers want it , romanians not !, 
  szeklers are pushing hard as we are getting ready to change the constitution , so they are trying to get their own autonomous region . 
  a lot of romanians think that autonomy is a gateway to secession . 
  tensions are rising . 
  http://www.romania-insider.com/romanias-hungarian-minority-hold-worldwide-day-of-protest-calling-for-autonomy/77089/ - some scandal involving ** contaminated milk ** . 
  various contaminated foodstufs have made the news recently . 
  http://www.financiarul.ro/2013/03/08/romanian-authorities-recall-aflatoxin-tainted-milk-from-market/ i do n't watch the local news that much , so my fellow countrymen might want to add some more topics and/or details . 
   but not for fyrom / macedonia . 
  oh , great !, 
  no , seriously , why the fuck not ? 
   really , we should have allowed the incorporation of the term `` macedonia '' in the name , but with the use of a disambiguating name specification back in the early 90s . 
  i always felt that agreeing on `` slavic-macedonia '' or `` northern macedonia '' would be the best way to go , and acceptable to both parties . 
  why did n't this happen ? 
  also take note that the map has the [ red vergina flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_republic_of_macedonia#.22vergina_flag.22_.281992.e2.80.931995.29 ) superimposed , another detail that is designed to piss off the greeks . 
  yep . 
  [ this is ] ( http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/eu27_populationcartogram.jpg ) what an areal remapping looks like . 
  [ thread a few days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19kriq/gridded_population_cartogram_of_the_eu/ ), 
  inb4 - `` what eu27 would look like ... '', 
  depending on context , '' \u021buic\u0103 '' and `` p\u0103linc\u0103 '' might not be the same thing . 
  yeah , but those are not representative samples for the whole population . 
  not saying it does n't . 
  there was a false dichotomy in the argument he mentioned of `` instead of focusing on war , the us should focus on research , like the eu '' ( paraphrasing from memory ) one can focus on both , via military research . 
  i suspect a lot of that research is military research . 
  wonder how those compare when it comes to the eu and the us . 
  just above the country where 42 % of the population thinks the sun revolves around the earth ... 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_battle_group  the balkan battlegroup is a european union battlegroup led by greece .

  til . 
  man , this is so badass !, 
   those are not in anyway related to my concerns about censorship . 
  straw man much ? 
  do you even understand the issue discussed ? 
  those are very much relevant to the discussion . 
   not all want to come to spread hate , lie and troll . 
  but some do . 
  those who come to `` engage each other , debate and learn , sometimes vent , sometimes laugh , sometimes looking for oc and kill time '' are not the issue . 
   you propose to control the discussion of certain issues that you might feel sensitive to . 
  i propose no such thing . 
  there is no discussion in / r/whiterights style posts , only primitive monologues . 
  if somebody wants a dialogue on racial superiority and frames it as a dialogue , in a civilized manner , you wo n't see me censoring it . 
   i have seen xenophobia in disguise by many here . 
  many considering themselves superior to southern europeans , invoking economic and cultural reasons . 
  making gross generalizations . 
  you 're right . 
  that 's a point that should be discussed . 
   you should read your country 's constitution . 
  i have , you should have too :  [ article 30 ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=2#t2c2s0a30 )  ( 7 ) any defamation of the country and the nation , ** any instigation ** to a war of aggression , ** to national , racial , class or religious hatred , any incitement to discrimination ** , territorial separatism , or public violence , ** as well as any obscene conduct contrary to morality shall be prohibited by law . 
  **  again , the fine line you keep blurring between hate speech and uncomfortable speech . 
  i have made that line more than clear . 
  you 're the one who keeps blurring it to make some point about how mods should let blatant racism bring down the level of discourse . 
   that still does n't mean that you can act with impunity . 
  [ yes i can ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists ) !, 
   please , with sugar on top since you ask nicely : http://i.imgur.com/inpwwuz.png,

  backstory : `` the united world college in mostar is home to more than 40 different nationalities . 
  located in a city still deeply divided by the war in people 's mind , it often is a symbol for a new generation of all balkan ethnicities . 
  this year uwcim was holding a cultural parade to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uwc movement . 
  we all proudly carried our flags through the streets on the bosnian and the croatian side of the city . 
  my serbian friend was walking hand in hand with his croatian girlfriend . 
  when an old lady asked her how she could dare to walk next to a serb , she kissed him . 
  this is when i took the picture . 
  it 's nothing special just a couple expressing their love but for us , here in mostar , it shows that the new generations are not willing to continue a war of minds . '',

  that 's like hungary 's kosovo . 
  sort of . 
  dont ' t forget the importance of transylvania and ~ ~ upper hungary ~ ~ slovakia in hungarian history .

   bagour admitted in court that the move had been `` tactless , '' but added that she had not meant it as provocation , i agree . 
  sounds like a case of * stupid * more than one of * jihadism * . 
   if you put on a controversial t-shirt yourself , you probably have to face some dispute/mocking/pressing charges ... children being socially embarrassed by clothes mom picks for him ?
