  i gave morrocans as an example of `` white '' to some people , `` brown '' to others . 
  you could switch morrocans to any random middle easterners . 
  you 're right . 
  i thought you meant that i should have mentioned `` in romania '' as in `` the denial happened in romania '' ( as opposed to it happening in germany ) . 
  romanians in general tend to be less violent the other europeans ( we have a very low crime rate , and it 's mostly non-violent crime ) . 
  i used the original title adding the most important bit of extra info i thought relevant ( that he 's a professor in germany ) . 
  the fact that he denied it in romania , germany or kazakhstan did not matter enough imo to warrant extra info in the title . 
   deal with it . 
  we are . 
   gatekeepers are a thing of the past . 
  gatekeepers are here to stay . 
  not every corner of the net is or should be a free-for-all-fiesta like 4chan . 
   the genuine concerns or as you say `` retarded shit '' those are not synonymous . 
  concerns framed as concerns will not be deleted . 
  random `` all x are scum/animals/etc '' otoh bring nothing to the discussion . 
   wo n't go away because you censor them . 
  they 'll grow and grow and eventually voice themselves by whatever means . 
  best thing we can do about it is talk it through and not bury it under votes or censorship . 
  that 's psychology 101 . 
  this is not society at large . 
  this is a subreddit . 
  yes , they might `` grow and grow '' , but they 'll do so somewhere else . 
   and if anyone wants to unsubscribe , let them . 
  why ? 
  i 'd rather keep the non-racist ones , then by inaction , keep the xenophobes . 
   it 's so obviously mirroring european society and we 're mirroring european society as well . 
  europe is not 1st-amendment-protected-america . 
  there are limits on hate-speech in europe . 
   yes you can , by voting for the guy who will reduce your taxes . 
  politicians have been known to lie about not raising taxes . 
   all the jews who were deported to ** transylvania ** by marshal antonescu returned home and lived [ transnistria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_governorate ), 
  what exactly do you mean by ethnic group ? 
  given [ the amount of genetic overlap in european populations ] ( http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/figure1a_600.jpg ) , i find it hard to believe you can tell czech and slovak , or slovak and hungarian apart by dna . 
  it 's more complicated than that : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_genetic_clustering, 
   you really need to look at communist propaganda and see that it 's actually 100 % lie . 
  you ca n't have efficient propaganda without some truth thrown in . 
  otherwise it 's not credible . 
   in a democratic society , you can choose what you want to give and what you want to receive . 
  i do n't think you get to choose how much taxes you pay . 
  also , i think you view westerners as more naive then they really are . 
  it 's all fine and dandy but : 1 . 
  saying retarded shit is way easier that combating it . 
  and that tends to bring the level of discussion down . 
  some xenophobes here are pushing an agenda , they are not here to engage in intellectual discussions . 
  they are here to rustle liberal jimmies . 
  i remember some quality contributors saying that they were thinking of unsubscribing from / r/europe because the influx of hateful comments . 
  if moderating comments like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgcskmz.png ) can prevent this , i 'm all for it . 
  i do n't think we should wait until there is a need to create / r/trueeurope, 
  mind giving examples ? 
  but the sudden increase in social mobility is directly connected to communism being instated in romania . 
  social mobility was terrible before 1945 . 
  as was literacy and other things . 
   they were silent wile you were raping the rest of the plant with bombs full of democracy the communists were silent about american imperialism in the third world ? 
   ** we ** 'll let you use the boat you previously owned ...  ** the party ** will take care of your children as it does with everyone oh look , an upper class . 
    you 'll say : but hey , the guy had 3 houses and you took 2 , how 's that not discrimination ? 
  well , it 's not . 
  it 's called communism ... 
  i have 10 houses , another guy has 2 , another guy has 1 . 
  here comes the party , and then we all have just one house . 
  now there are 2 points of view : 1 . 
  we are all treated fairly because we all got exactly 1 house 2 . 
  we were not treated fairly because i lost 90 % of my houses , the other 50 % and the third guy lost nothing . 
  hence , class discrimination , because the rich class gets fucked harder . 
   please define what racism is . 
   what happens with reported comments and posts ? 
  explain the decision process until the mods take action and how these actions look like . 
  until i 've had a discussion with the other mods , i 'll refrain from answering these questions . 
  this is not just about my view on the issues , but a matter of collective mod policy . 
   what is more important : freedom of speech or human dignity ? 
  both , as well as other things . 
  i care about freedom of speech , including the freedom to have a clean forum to speak in . 
  messages such as :  * that kike disgusts me . 
  he openly called for all french people to race mix to mongrelize the nation . 
  * add very little to the conversation , but brings the level of discourse down . 
   that will not be tolerated see the one above . 
   examples of posts that will be tolerated  * that guy disgusts me . 
  he openly called for all french people to racially mix . 
  i think that is wrong/stupid/whatever * i 'm all for a minimal approach , but i would rather this place remains a place for civilized discussions . 
   you 're using the implementation of communism to fight the theory . 
  \u266b this i tell ya , brother , \u266a \u266b you ca n't have one without the other . 
  \u266a  imagine implementing communism by not allowing inheritance of any kind . 
  you get to a level field society in a few decades . 
  something tells me that even if that would somehow be enforced , it would have a lot of unforeseen consequences . 
  maybe if you tried having an upper limit on what an inheritance can be , but banning it all together would be a tough sell . 
  plus the fact that people - crafty devils as they are - will find loopholes and informal ways of having inheritances . 
  plus i 'm curios what would happen to somebody 's belongings after he died ? 
   i 'm just saying you can get there without much discrimination ( or none at all ) . 
  sure , you can * try to * get there , but human nature goes against not having classes . 
  sure , you can have some light form of egalitarianism within small human groups , but in large groups ( cities , etc ) , no chance . 
  humans are naturally prone to forming hierarchies . 
   i 'm pretty sure that romania under soviet occupation is n't the best example for affirmative anything . 
  but u/anarchisto is right . 
  a lot of peasants benefited from communism , including my own grandparents . 
  in two generations , my family went from `` poorest in the village '' to `` urban intelectuals '' . 
  what i 'm saying is that the uppward motion had a downward counterpart for others ( the doctors and intellectuals you talk about ) . 
  and both are connected . 
   you 're a bit extreme and i could use your comparison to compare taxation to the holocaust ... 
  there 's a huge difference between : `` you do n't need 2 houses when there are people freezing to death '' and `` i 'm gon na gas you because you 're different '' i 'm using an extreme example to make a point , the point being that communism , or at least the road to communism can have a lot of class discrimination in it . 
  i see your point , but the truth still remains that communism is more than just `` you do n't need 2 houses when there are people freezing to death '' . 
  here you 're talking more about leftism in general , than communism .
