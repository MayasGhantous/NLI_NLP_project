  you can have redistribution and social safety-nets and so on ( which i very much favor ) without resorting to narratives about `` classless societies '' ( which i find impossible ) , which is what communism is about . 
  i know we 're opening a huge discussion here , about what is communism , and what is `` the dictatorship of the poletariat '' and other such marxist concepts . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19u5ne/why_are_we_western_europeans_conditioned_to_hate/c8rd2di ), 
  to a lot of people morrocans would not be classified in the same category as european whites . 
  race is subjective , given how there 's a continuum from dublin to kolkata , where one draws the line is pretty arbitrary . 
  to some , middle easterners are white , to some , they are `` brown '' . 
   how can there be class discrimination , if by marx 's definition , social classes are part of the capitalist mode of production ? 
  not necessarily . 
  marx identifies class discrimination in pre-capitalist ( slaveholder , feudal ) periods as well . 
  the transition from capitalism to communism can still contain class discrimination , even if the end-stage contains none . 
  think of it this way : a white supremacist society with 100 % whites contains no racial discrimination because there are n't any `` lesser races '' left . 
  but the road to a white supremacist utopia contains a lot of racism . 
   there was some `` affirmative action '' ( in education , for instance ) for people from peasant/worker families there was also the opposite , whereby people of bourgeois origin were handled less favorably ( starting from light discrimination do outright gulag-ing ) . 
  people of `` unhealthy social origin '' . 
  a discource centered on `` exploiting classes '' vs `` exploited classes '' certainly fosters a lot of class resentment and classism . 
   you 're not ( too much of ) an idiot you have been banned from ~ ~ r/pyongyang ~ ~ r/europe, 
  petition denied !, 
  * next !, 
   does n't contain any racial or ethnic discrimination embedded into it . 
  but some would argue that it does contain class discrimination embedded into it . 
  thank you . 
  i 'll do my best to make / r/europe stronk , or die trying !, 
  is joke !, 
  i think this is the [ nomination and voting thread ( 2-in-1 ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/196bah/reurope_new_mods_nominations/ ), 
  i 'd like to thank those who voted for me , the mod academy , my family , who supported me , and above all god !, 
  any suggestions are welcomed . 
   romania and bulgaria could organise a uk/irish-style common travel area between them in the meantime , though . 
  we really should . 
  i know . 
  but i meant `` monitor like germany '' , not `` do everything like germany '' . 
   and i understand you lived in a `` communist '' dictatorship and i bet it was awful . 
  but it was n't communism ok here 's the deal . 
  people may have different , sometimes related , definitions of what \u201e communism '' is and what the implications of said \u201e communism '' are . 
  just like an anarcho-capitalist and a communist have , imho , different definitions of \u201e capitalism '' ( ask an an-cap and he 'll say \u201e [ true ] capitalism '' has never been tried ) . 
  sometimes , before dismissing something as \u201e not the real deal '' one should ask himself if he 's not threading close to \u201e no real scotsmen '' . 
   people are allowed opinions on reddit just as long as they are not left wing oh , come on . 
  reddit , generally speaking , is on the left side of the political center . 
  i was thinking about [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) . 
  people who are nostalgic for the commie days would not necessarily vote for a far-left party . 
  i would n't call giurgea neoliberal . 
  libertarian is closer to his brand of idiot . 
  anyway , even if there are no antidemocratic leftists , there might be in the future . 
  i really do n't care what flavor they are , tbh . 
  as long as they are anti-democratic , the state should keep an eye on them . 
  how about we do n't ban symbols , and just get an agency to monitor anti-democratic organisations , like they moniotor in germany . 
  not the point he was making . 
  half of them are n't even translations , just fonetic adaptations , as people used to call them . 
  even satu mare used to be s\u0103tmar . 
  verne gyula is still in use afaik . 
  romanian rarely does this , except with some foreign monarchs , transylvanian princes and gheorghe doja . 
  elections are coming . 
  there is no green in transylvania . 
  i 'd put even cluj and timi\u0219oara in the yellow category , even though they are are student towns , and thus , theoretically more open minded . 
  in 6 years of college in cluj i have never seen gay guys hold hands in public , which would be my first criterion for putting a city in the `` green list '' . 
  azores , now with 200 % more freedom !, 
  i was n't sure if he 's ignorant or trolling , so i assumed the first , and responded accordingly , to benefit other readers . 
  \u201e what romanians look like '' is a way more complex discussion , and gets more complicated when the reader is a foreigner . 
  the picture got changed in the meantime . 
  romanians are a varied folk . 
  those in the north-west resemble central europeans , with high proportions of bue-eyed blondes in the apuseni mountains . 
  in the north-east , a significant share are what one would call slavic ( blond , green eyed , etc ) . 
  what you describe is relevant maybe to urban southern romania , and even so , it 's a huge generalization . 
  there are 10 romanians living in san marino . 
  vasile gets arrested 5 times , and convicted 0 times , while the others are never arrested . 
  the police say they made 100 arrests in 2012 , 5 of them romanian . 
  by your logic , 5/10 , that is half of all romanians in san marino got arrested . 
  truth is only one did , and the arrest rate is not 50 % , but 10 % . 
  that 's how . 
  so romanians might just get arrested ( and released ) more often then others ? 
  romania too . 
  our national day is [ great union day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_union_day ), 
  and the us mottos are \u201e in god we trust '' and \u201e e pluribus unum '' . 
  \u201e united we stand '' is the motto of kentucky , and appears on the flag of missoury , but it is also used by ulster loyalists . 
  anyway , i looked for a version without the flag and motto , but could n't find one .

  source : http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=1610 also : http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=2668, 
   yet in romania , belief in magic is not regarded as hocus pocus . 
  this is one hell of a generalization, 
  but the problem is n't the kitsch per se , but the things featured . 
  the previous poster made it seem that the problem is the fact that `` skopje [ is transforming ] into the kitsch capital of the balkans '' . 
   the crazy plan to transform skopje into the kitsch capital of the balkans , where alexander the great meets czar samuel ? 
  since when is this relevant to the accession process ? 
  there is another tradition . 
  the first 9 days of march are called `` babe '' ( old women ) . 
  people pick a day out of these 9 beforehand ( and that is their `` bab\u0103 '' ) , and if the day turns out to be fair , they 'll have a good year , and if the day turns out to be ugly/cold , they 'll have a bad year . 
  apparently it 's connected to the legend of [ baba dochia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baba_dochia ), 
  yeah ? 
  well happy [ m\u0103r\u0163i\u015for ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martisor ) !, 
  yes . 
  i 'm not belgian . 
  not just turkey . 
  urban areas by default tend to be less religious ( less conservative overall ) than the countryside . 
  you must be putting smiles on belgian faces, 
  might be something related to cultural muslims vs practicing muslims, 
   neither the meaning the way the meaning shifted is in no way unique to this case . 
   nor the phonetics fit expand on this . 
  what should * brandeum 's descendant sound like today ? 
  maybe [ jaszik influence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1sz_people ) , maybe [ turkic influence ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1999h3/i_made_a_map_of_words_for_cheese_in_some_european/c8m3we3 ), 
   the word br\u00e2nz\u0103 seems to be of pre-proto-albanian ( whether it 's ancient dacian , thracian or illyrian has still not been clearly established ) , being derived from old romanian r\u00e2ndz\u0103 ( stomach ) . 
  there is [ a latin etymology proposed as well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1999h3/i_made_a_map_of_words_for_cheese_in_some_european/c8lz7ww ) .
