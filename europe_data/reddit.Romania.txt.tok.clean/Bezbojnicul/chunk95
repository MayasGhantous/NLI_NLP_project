  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/flag_of_the_cossack_hetmanat.svg/1000px-flag_of_the_cossack_hetmanat.svg.png ) needs to be their flag !, 
  yeah , sorry about that . 
   question : qd2 .1 . 
  for each of the following statements , please state to what degree it coresponds or not with your own opinion . 
   choice : do you feel an eu citizen ? 
   answers : total ` yes ' ( just realized it 's not about europeanness , but eu citizenship . 
  i ca n't find the source or anything in english except for a very brief dutch article . 
   horse meat ... 
  this one was n't our fault, 
  3.2 % officially ( census ) , around 10 % unofficially ( estimates ), 
  they also exported pizza and pasta , so it balances out . 
  remove meatballs from premises !, 
  obergramatikfuhrer ( disclaimer : i dont sprache german ), 
  even if you do n't want to be a mod , i hope you keep contributing to this sub . 
  / r/europe needs people with quality comments such as yours !, 
  also , he fucked up answer nr . 
  it should be  right * / s *, 
  he will remove ~ ~ kebab ~ ~ * spam * from premises in a level-headed fashion, 
  i 'm quite honored by the nomination ( no experience with css , though ) . 
  if need be , [ i shall do my duty to my fellow euroredditors with pride ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i9yc5.jpg ) . 
  italy , do n't fuck this up . 
  or ` pateu ', 
  i know . 
  but letting english be the sole official one is a minefield as well . 
  how about we make all 3 official languages of the eu . 
  all official documents should be translated into these 3 . 
  then all coutries could translate the documents relevant for itself into its national language . 
  maybe it would be better then the 20-odd language fiesta we have now . 
  you 'll have less then that by the time we 're finished with you . 
   i 'll be at your door step . 
  underachiever !, 
  i 'll be settled in his house by the time he comes home from wherever he spent his new year 's eve . 
  some say that that might be the reason . 
  also , some say that dubbing is the reason english in hungary is so bad . 
  now i have no idea how much is truth in these two statements , but it might account for it at least partially . 
  same here with the titles . 
   should only watch movies in the original language ( good look with movies from asia ) most people i 've met complain more about all the asian actors looking the same , tbh . 
  i do n't understand why some people think that just because it 's hard for them , it 's just as hard for everyone else . 
  housewives in romania are handling turkish and korean telenovelas pretty well , without any dubbing . 
  yeah , older people might have a problem if their eyesight is bad , but dubbing everything for a few grannies is overkill . 
   but for many people who do n't understand the language it would be uncomfortable to read subtitles all the time . 
  romanian here . 
  no it 's not . 
  you get used very quickly . 
   do you watch a lot of movies in a language you do n't understand ? 
  i do ( watch danish shows , korean movies , persian , whatever ) . 
  it 's way better than dubbing ( which i used to experience a lot when i was a kid , as hungarian movies were all dubbed ) . 
   more than twenty years after the change of system , democracy , it seems , has not brought more understanding between budapest and bucharest this is pure ignorance . 
  sure , there has been some friction about the szekler flag , but saying that things have not improved in 20 years is false . 
  now i just wish both our politicians acted a little bit more calmly . 
   when all enforcement indicators are taken into account ( see details in the internal market enforcement table below ) , romania , estonia , cyprus , the czech republic and lithuania are the best overall performers . 
  you brits and your imperial units ... 
   this is the anthem of the szeklers in transylvania the lyrics , for the curious : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szekely_himnusz also , better/longer version : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16obr_q29ee, 
   hora unirii / dance of union [ 4 ] , alecsandri / flechtenmacher yeah , wanted to mention that too . 
  damn  also , your # 4 is jokingly known as ` the ballad of kassai '  i know  ps . 
  the israeli anthem has romanian origins as well . 
  [ kinda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatikvah ), 
   m8 i have tagged you as far-ultra-skopjanophille , but despite the fact that my ancient greek upbringing forbids me , i will still reply and expand on your assumption this is golden !, 
   ) anyway , my assumption is based on what my aunt and uncle have told me ( both living in piraeus since the early 90s ) . 
  sure , i realize that this is not a general feeling , but it sorta is in the air . 
  but do n't worry , you can find these idiots in romania and hungary as well , not to mention , as it 's evident , in macedonia ( the other one ) . 
  the romanian ones are called [ protochronists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ) , and the hungarian wackos seem to have a preferance for [ sumer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_turanism#christian_turanists ) . 
   trying to explain to her why the british are n't illiterate gay barbarians ( meanwhile she is 1/16th british , go figure ) . 
  that 's nothing . 
  i 've met half-hungarians who were kind of anti-hungarian . 
  ok , piggy-backing on your comment : patriotic nr .1 : the anthem .

  also , the whole `` we invented european/western civilization '' thing . 
  they had it pretty good from the 10-th century to the 16th , and then in the late 19th . 
  we tend to have a skewed perspective because we mainly focus on transylvania , which retained internal autonomy under a hungarian nobility even after the [ battle of mohacs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_moh%c3%a1cs ) , but we ignore central hungary , which was incorporated as ottoman provinces . 
  [ true ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahypaqalfzy ) . 
  [ 12:08 east of bucharest ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0809407/ ) is funny and i recommend it . 
  ( [ trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az7mffb14xo ) ), 
  it 's worth it !,

  while not related , they are both [ agglutinative ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agglutinative_language ) . 
  well , either he 'll teleport from bulgaria to slovakia , or he 'll go via romania-hungary or serbia-hungary, 
  ninja , maybe . 
  depends . 
   washington d.c. for being an oreo cookie . 
  ( black people on the outside , white politicians in the middle ) obama sort of ruins this joke now . 
  thanks obama !, 
  states 's rights would probably have a more positive image if it would n't be pushed by southern racists against the whole civil rights thing . 
  fuck bullfights . 
  those are for sissies . 
  bring back real gladiatorial fight . 
  i too support the revival of gladiatorial fight !, 
  it 's part of our graeco-roman heritage !, 
  ah , the joys of centralism ... 
  there are a lot of people in belgium who identify as [ luxemburghers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxemburg_%28province%29 ) too . 
   these western turkey greeks are direct descendants of the ancient greeks who lived on those lands for thousands of years . 
  that 's a tad simplistic . 
  you really do n't think greeks assimilated non-greeks ( all kinds of pre-greek anatolians for example ) into their midst , especially considering how greek was the prestige language of the eastern roman empire ? 
  your argument seems to revolve around the idea that the greeks did not mix with other peoples through all these centuries . 
  the last time uk 's borders changed was in the early 20th century ( * cough * ireland * cough * ) .
