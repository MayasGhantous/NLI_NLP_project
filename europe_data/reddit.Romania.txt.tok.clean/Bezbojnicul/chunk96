  and people in the balkans are sensitive to the point of paranoia . 
   when one country copies another countries founding myths it also lays claim to that countries territory . 
  no it does n't . 
  but russia being on georgia 's mind is not the same as russia having influence on georgia . 
  actually i would say that georgia 's fear of russia and general pro-western attitude makes it less influenced by russia . 
  on the other hand , armenia has a very good relationship with russia , and needs russia in case the nagorno-karabakh conflict heats up again . 
  that makes russia far more \u201e welcome '' in yerevan . 
  also , moldova has the transnistrian conflict to take care of . 
  obviously they are both misguided . 
  i mean everybody knows that the great heroes of antiquity and all the white race come from the dacian . 
  reminds me when i was in budapest , and in the basement of the grand basilica some curator/caretaker started telling me how hungarians were god 's chosen people , for whom he has a great plan . 
  god , this is retarded ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_prayer_ ( video )  one of subsequent effects of this video is the usage of the term `` makedonoidi '' as a pejorative slang-term of choice for zealous supporters of the theory that today 's ethnic macedonians have ethnically , linguistically , historically preserved the culture of ancient macedonians , which were , according to them , not greeks  ), 
   the austrians had a fit about a sausage being declared by another country and asked for immediate eu talks and discussions . 
  about a sausage !, 
  that was retarded as well, 
  the president is still the very pro-american saakashvili, 
  well how does one measure influence when comparing georgia and armenia ? 
  that 's what i 'm asking . 
  nope . 
   georgia is influenced by russia slightly more than armenia why would you say that ? 
  georgia is way more anti-russia than armenia . 
  also , what about moldova ? 
  i like it ( watched 3/4 of an episode before falling asleep last night ) . 
  sure , i realise that half the jokes just pass me by , but all in all it 's a nice light comedy . 
  i was expecting a bit more comedically , but even so , it 's quite enjoyable . 
  also , the fact that it 's multilingual is a big bonus for me . 
  how does one pronounce `` bl\u00e1thnaid n\u00ed chofaigh '' ? 
   fyi , `` crisis eile '' means `` another crisis '' . 
  thought it was her name . 
  well it appears to work in romania , so it probably works for everyone . 
  he 's just like us then , right ? 
   in venice i was at a restaurant where the tip of the waiter was on the bill . 
  i was actually slightly offended by that because let me be the one to decide whether that waiter has earned it or not . 
  i had the exacts same reaction when i saw the * coperto * .

  just like the romanian verse often cited by nationalists :  de la nistru p\u00e2n ' la tisa  from the dniester to the tisa while the tisa does flow on the northern border a bit , it 's ussually meant as the hypothetical western border . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/romanianterritories.png/674px-romanianterritories.png ), 
  problem kinda got solved , both legally and diplomatically : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/18244k/unofficial_flag_issue_heats_up_romaniahungary/c8bj6wk, 
  you might find that data here : http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1756/20123065.full ( full text of the paper ), 
  http://phys.org/news/2013-02-cultural-slower-genetic-divergence.html  human history is filled with folktales , and oftentimes similar tales appear in the record of different cultures . 
  one of those is referred to as the `` kind and unkind girls '' tale . 
  it 's about two girls -- one who is nice to everyone she meets and is eventually rewarded for it with gifts of gold -- the other girl is mean and nasty and winds up being given a box of snakes . 
  historians have found many variations on this tale -- in some it 's two boys , in others its women of different classes . 
  what remains the same is the moral . 
  in this new study , the researchers sought to compare the way the story spread from one culture to another in europe , as compared to the way cultures mingle and procreate . 
   in analyzing historic documents , the researchers found 700 variants of the tale from cultures across europe as they existed over a hundred years ago -- in 31 languages . 
  they then compared genetic records of the people that currently live in those cultural areas with the different tale variants they 'd found . 
  in so doing , they found that people living in close proximity , but of different cultural backgrounds , were ten times as likely to produce children with one another as they were to take on the different version of the tale . 
  this , the team suggests , shows that assimilation of cultural aspects , particularly if there are language differences involved , is much slower than the spread of genes across geographic areas . 
   the team notes that in europe today , there are very few differences in the gene pools of different countries , indicating a very high degree of comingling . 
  at the same time , most of the countries in europe have managed to hold on to many of their cultural differences . 
  this suggests they say , that cultural traits are less likely to cross borders , than are genes . 
  but language differences are n't the only reason that culture does n't travel -- the researchers also found many instances of differing variants of the tale between people that lived close together and spoke the same language , indicating that there are other factors involved as well in some areas . 
  roughly : * on thursday , febr . 
  7 , [ romanian ] foreign minister , titus corl\u0103\u0163ean , , had a talk over the phone with his hungarian counterpart , janos martonyi , and both agreed that the interest of their two state 's cooperation warrants that they avoid escalating with public statements . 
  * which was what they should have done in the first place , instead of waving their dicks . 
  some cities also have flags ( oradea , tg . 
  mures , etc ) , and i think they would be considered territorial divisions as well . 
  fyi , the covasna tribunal just passed a ruling that the use of the szekler flag as the flag of the covasna county is legal . 
  usually , it the `` not listening to the desires of the minority '' part that pushes a region towards secession . 
  the basques get a more fair deal than catalunya , that 's why catalan secession is going strong , while basque secession is loosing steam . 
  sure , an autonomous szeklerland can be a stepping stone towards independence , but i think , if treated correctly , it can be a buffer against secession . 
  [ apparently , some do ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/182y7b/question_to_catalonians_how_would_you_feel_if_the/c8b8jfg ), 
   note also that the vojvodina flag is not the hungarian flag , just like how the szekely flag is not the hungarian flag . 
  the paralell with vojvodina breaks down when you consider the fact that vojvodina is multiethnic , while szeklerland is pretty much defined monoethnically ( aka `` the compact hungarian area in eastern transylvania '' )  this is not an issue of separatism , it 's an issue with an over-controlling central government micromanaging things agreed . 
   since it 's not an ethnic issue but it is . 
  the szekler flag is viewed primarily as an ethnic hungarian flag . 
  there is no `` romanian szekler land '' , it 's viewed as a region whose creation is wanted only by the local hungarians . 
  that 's why the discussion turned ethnic very quick . 
   btw . 
  if it 's illegal to have non-romanian flags on public buildings , then why is there an eu flag flying on the romanian parliament ? 
  iirc the eu flag is also mentioned in the law as being `` allowed '' . 
  on the other hand , i do n't know if local flags are mentioned in the law . 
  i wonder if [ the flag of oradea/nagyv \u00e1rad ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3svee.jpg ) is legal in front of the town hall . 
  also , neam\u021b citadel , part of a larger museum complex subordinate to the neam\u021b county council [ flies a moldavian flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2799nb.jpg ) . 
  i wonder how legal that is . 
  also , keep in mind that this whole shit was started by an idiot nationalist prefect with a hobby of picking on the local hungarian mayors . 
  then it escalated pretty quick . 
  note : this is about having the flag on public buildings , not flying it in general . 
  the flag is not illegal , as you seem to imply . 
  what 's illegal , some claim , is its use on public buildings . 
   but it does n't change the fact that the romanian side is simply wrong on this issue . 
  there are two levels here . 
  is it illegal to fly the szekler flag ? 
  romanian side says it is - and might be right - , others say it is n't . 
  my hunch ( as no one is actually mentioning the exact law ) is that it 's somewhat ambiguous and open to debate . 
  which leads to the second question : 2 . 
  is it wrong to forbid it ? 
  my opinion is that it 's wrong , and thus , if the law is such , it needs to be changed . 
   is this what romanians learn in history class ? 
  nope . 
  this is what drama-queens understand . 
  it is . 
  an earlier post on the issue , giving [ with some background can be found here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/170hpr/newsflag_controversy_in_romania_szekler_land/ ) . 
  and [ today 's post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/18244k/unofficial_flag_issue_heats_up_romaniahungary/ ), 
  cities always change in favor of the dominant ethnic group . 
  the commies just speeded the process up a bit . 
  think about the fact that area north of oradea is still pretty hungarian , yet there is nowhere near as much drive for autonomy/selfdetermination as there is in szeklerland . 
  and there was some resettlement of romanians in szeklerland cities , but it was minimal . 
  regarding the second part of your post http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slippery_slope  in logic and critical thinking , a slippery slope is an informal fallacy .
