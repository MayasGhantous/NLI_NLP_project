  a slippery slope argument states that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect , much like an object given a small push over the edge of a slope sliding all the way to the bottom . 
  look at italy . 
  the tyrol germans , the aosta french and the friulians all have autonomy , but the arbereshe ( of southern italy ) and the slovenes do n't seem to have any intention to get autonomy . 
  via [ mapporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/17zr0p/solar_power_potential_of_the_united_kingdom/c8ar927 ), 
   do n't the sun and moon symbolize islam ? 
  among other things . 
  star and moon actually , not sun and moon, 
   but ethnically distinct from hungarians nowadays , szeklers define themselves as ethnic hungarians with a different origin , more then a different ethnicity . 
  it 's something of a regional/cultural identity more then an ethnic one . 
   are the descendants of avars [ ... ] , so basically the descendants of attila 's huns you 're making a jump from huns to avars pretty quickly . 
  i 'm not saying it 's true or false , but being avar does not necessarily mean you are descended from huns . 
   the relationship between sz\u00e9kelys and the hungarians around for example oradea/nagyv \u00e1rad is not 100 % ideal . 
  sz\u00e9kelys often think transsylvanian hungarians compromise too easily with the romanian state , do n't have a firm enough backbone , especially in oradea/nagyv \u00e1rad . 
  so much so that in the commie times , szekelys tended to go to different university cities then the `` proper '' hungarians . 
  some szekelys prefered to go to college in bucharest , rather then cluj , the main hungarian city in transylvania . 
  a lot of non-szekely hungarians were urban dwellers and looked down on the szekelys as hillbilies , while szekelys considered hungarians as arigant assholes . 
  and yes , szekelys do tend to be more uncompromising , but whether it 's because of a backbone , or a thick skull , it depends on which side you ask . 
   `` the constitution says we have a unitary state '' -- the constitution can be changed . 
  also worth noting that a unitary state does not forbid local autonomy ( italy and spain are unitary states , as opposed to federal ) . 
  unitary is not the same as centralized . 
  they also use argument that `` the law which mandates the use of the national flag on institutions forbids other flags . '', 
  again , it can be changed ( athough i 'm not really familiar with the law itself . ), 
  to be fair , `` racism '' is increasingly used to mean any kind of `` xenophobia '' ( ethnic , national , religious , racial , whatever ) . 
  but technically , you are correct , so i do n't really get the downvotes . 
   so i imagine moldovan ( moldavian ? ), 
  annoys you . 
  it annoys me when some insist that it 's a different language from romanian , as it 's factually kind of incorrect . 
  the difference between moldovan and romanian is about the difference between american and british english . 
  the vernacular can be a bit difficult to understand at times , but the standard varieties are virtually the same . 
  but i do n't have a problem with the fact that they name it differently , i do n't care if they feel romanian or not , or if they want to reunite or not . 
  some minor corrections :  the ** secuiesc region ** , or sz\u00e9kely land * szekler region * would have been a more correct english translation . 
   which allows ** the hungarian minority -- called secui ** -- to feel at home . 
  only about half of the hungarians in romania are considered szekler ( ro : * secui * , hu : * sz\u00e9kely * ) , namely , the ones living in szekler land . 
  the rest are not . 
  also , an earlier post on the issue , giving [ some aditional background can be found here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/170hpr/newsflag_controversy_in_romania_szekler_land/ ), 
  well , some people do call american english just `` american '' . 
  but yeah , the 4 languages are basically 4 standardizations of the same language . 
  they could call it `` yugoslav '' , so it 's more neutral , but i do n't think this will catch on . 
  but then again , calling one language by different names is not that big of a problem . 
  it 's when people start insisting that they are totally different languages that i start to get annoyed .

  farange is like the eu version of / r/thanksobama, 
  not intervening also had repercussions for the next decade . 
  just saying . 
  utter bollocks . 
   but you have done this on behalf of the european union . 
  it is now an eu mission . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's still a french mission . 
  well french + ecowas . 
  the same way libya was a franco - british mission , not an eu mission ( especially considering germany 's opposition ) . 
   i do not want the united kingdom to be part of a militaristic warlike european union oh yeah , poor peaceful uk , being dragged by the eu into missions like iraq , afghanistan and libya . 
  google image search seems to point to a russian origin for the image : http://hardingush.livejournal.com/35609.html but [ these ones ] ( http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3914646792644&amp;set=o.152316564794359&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1 ) are roma . 
  which one more exactly ? 
  between the walls of the medieval saxon [ fortified church in ca\u021ba ( katzendorf ) ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/biserica_fortificat%c4%83_din_ca%c8%9ba ) , the authorities built a toilet illegally . 
  apparently , a school functions inside the old church-complex , and it needed a toilet , so they ignored the part where the complex is a historical monument , and built a toilet , most likely without the required paperwork .

  you can customize the flair by changing the text when you hover over . 
  put an austrian or eu flair and add the text `` hungarian in austria '' . 
  or do n't . 
  get yourself a flair, 
  i 'd say it 's acceptable but not popular in romania . 
  one is kind of expected to have children , but people ussualy stop at the first one . 
  it 's seen as the next logical step after marriage . 
  if people do n't have children , family members start nagging and asking why . 
  you wo n't get shunned or cast out , but `` grandma '' will whine passive-agressively a lot about wanting `` grandchildren '' . 
  age of first child has been generally increasing , and birthrates falling as everywhere . 
   do people think they need to keep having more children , or are people concerned about overpopulation ? 
  well , underpopulation is sometimes brought up . 
  the usual , we are less and less , and , halfjokingly that the chinese are more and more . 
  also , any talk about demographics includes the whining about how the roma ( gypsies ) have a higher birthrate and we 'll all be assimilated by them ( very simmilar to the `` muslims/mexicans will outbreed us '' narrative in western europe/usa ) . 
  the one place in western europe that really felt like it went through communism is southern belgium , namely liege and charleroi . 
   also , many people name czech as an eastern country , but i have always learned it was a central european one . 
  the two are not mutually exclusive , as they are not mere geographical names . 
  eastern european is a historical thing , meaning `` former communist bloc '' while central european is a cultural thing , and it means that it 's part of ( german influenced ) [ mitteleuropa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) . 
  in the context of the current thread , the historical east-west divide applies . 
  as czechia was east of the iron curtain , it 's eastern european . 
  they 'll probably introduce the bilingual sign , then some nocturnal vandal will spray over the cyrillic part . 
  then the authorities will replace the signs . 
  repeat a few times , after which people will just get used to it and they wo n't spray over any more . 
  that was the case in romania , when in 2002 any locality with at least 20 % minorities had to put up bilingual sign . 
  a lot of nationalists did n't like seeing [ hungarian names in transylvania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_minority_in_romania ) . 
  i wonder how many of the vukovar croats are actually against it ? 
   i have to say i agree with him on the tuaregs 's part . 
  we 're not talking enough about this issue . 
  yep . 
  that 's gon na be the hardest to solve part in the post-conflict phase . 
  and i frankly do n't like the [ news coming out of the area ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17r5mu/timbuktu_hails_french_president_hollande/ ) :  the un special adviser on the prevention of genocide said there had been serious allegations of human rights violations committed by the malian army , including summary executions and disappearances . 
  there had also been reports of incidents of mob lynching and looting of properties belonging to arab and tuareg communities , which had been accused of supporting armed islamist groups , adama dieng added . 
  the allegations came as heavily-armoured columns of french and malian troops continued their advance in northern mali . 
  also :  the taliban are doing better than ever . 
  except , you know , when they were in charge ... 
   as someone said before , this law protect children of names like `` hitler satan mcbuggerballs '' iceland goes well beyond that . 
   if the 1st ( or the 2nd ) chapter of `` colloquial icelandic '' is accurate , names in iceland must be subject to the declination rules of the language . 
  so do names in other languages . 
   icelandic speakers would find themselves in weird linguistics situations .
