  oh come on , the speakers can adapt a name . 
  trust me , as someone living in a mixed hungarian-romanian area , ( completely different languages , each with sounds absent in the other ) i 've heard a lot of names being adapted into the other language . 
  if you 're havin ' euro-problems i feel bad for you son i gots me 10 problems but the brits ai n't one, 
  more ... bulgarian ... :p, 
  i am fully ok with naming restrictions , as is the case in romania . 
  ( no obscene , ridiculous or other names harmful to the child ) . 
  i do not agree with lists of predefined names , as it implies that any deviation from the norm is harmful . 
  as someone with a quite unusual name , i can assure you that an unusual name is not necessarily bad . 
  but what if i want to name my kid something perfectly ok , but which is not on the list . 
  maybe something a bit exotic , but not entirely . 
  let 's say the way boris is an unusual name for a brit , but it 's not something that strange and not at all obscene , as to cause shame . 
  there is a huge difference between `` fuckcunt mcshithead '' and `` carolina '' or `` christina '' . 
   browse any of the major uk newspapers websites comments in almost any topic and i do n't agree or feel ashamed at what my countryfolk write . 
  comment sections are retarded everywhere, 
   but experts said that while up to 2,000 manuscripts may have been lost at the south african-funded ahmed baba institute ransacked by the rebels , the bulk of the around 300,000 texts existing in timbuktu and its surrounding region were believed to be safe . 
  that 's 2000 too many . 
  still good to hear the damage was somewhat smaller than thought . 
  also , i love this part :  the two sources said that soon after tuareg rebel fighters swept into timbuktu on april 1 in a rebellion later hijacked by sharia-observing islamist radicals , curators and collectors of the manuscripts had hidden the texts away for safety . 
   `` they had shipped them out and distributed them around , '' jeppie said . 
  the malian source , asking not to be named , said the manuscripts had been concealed `` a little bit everywhere '' . 
   edit : and apparently half of sardinia is spanish ? . . 
  i think it has something to do with this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algherese, 
   the mnla has also said it is prepared to work with the french `` to eradicate terrorist groups '' in the north but that it would not allow the return of the malian army , which it accused of `` crimes against the civilian population '' . 
  this might become a problem ... 
  while i agree with you that a slap when warranted is not child abuse , your constant appeal to tradition is not that great an argument . 
  a lot of retarded shit was and still is done because of tradition . 
  some things that \u201e have a really long history '' and \u201e have been done for centuries , millenia '' are obsolete . 
  you 're right . 
  i was thinking about the fact that * ( snow ) board * is translated as * plac\u0103 * and i thought there might be more general than these two . 
  nevermind . 
  time for me to go to bed . 
   ... and card , like in sound card ( plac\u0103 de sunet ) . 
  ~ ~ i meant at the beginning . ~ ~, 
  yeah . 
  this made me extremely sad and angry . 
  ontopic : [ an article ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/28/timbuktu-library-centuries-african-history ) , a [ documentary ] ( http://vimeo.com/23791585 ) and an [ / r/askhistorians thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/17fpf1/the_destruction_of_the_timbuktu_mali_library_what/ ) on the subject . 
   we do seem to have one original term , plac\u0103 ~ ~ seems like a translation of * board * , like in * motherboard * ( * plac\u0103 de baz\u0103 * ) ~ ~, 
   and it mostly succeeded . 
  there are still loads of words of slavic origin . 
  as well as words of turkic origin . 
  a lot of the turkic ones that were replaced had to do with ottoman institutions that became obsolete , and mostly used by the learned elites during the phanariote years . 
  this last change is just one of sufix . 
  like \u201e turkish '' changing to \u201e turkian '' . 
  one can also say \u201e unguresc '' or \u201e ungar '' , \u201e bulg\u0103resc '' or \u201e bulgar '' , and so on , with the \u201e - esc '' sounding a little old-school . 
  this change in style was not confined only to \u201e rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 / rom\u00e2n\u0103 '', 
   also , dischet\u0103 was used interchangeably with floppy , but the technology is obsolete so we shall never know who won . 
  my generation used * dischet\u0103 * more often then * floppy * , so a trend can be deduced . 
  also , * tastatur\u0103 * ( keyboard ) appears to come from german , which is interesting . 
   octet is slowly giving way to byte i 've never used octet and i 've had a computer since the mid 90 's . 
  i only heard it used by my informatics teacher in school , and by my mom occasionally . 
  i can safely say that it 's not used in my generation ( born in the 80 's ) . 
  me too . 
  ( tbh , i guessed at the one with the jury . 
  the others were easy ), 
  we kept \u201e mouse '' ( now sometimes spelled phonetically \u201e maus '' ) , both \u201e calculator '' and \u201e computer '' , and i think \u201e internaut '' is still obscure . 
  the press seems to prefer \u201e utilizator de internet '', 
   well the @ is called klammeraffe ( clip monkey ) in german , maybe borrowed the idea there ? 
  at first the name for @ in romanian was \u201e coad\u0103-de-maimu\u021b\u0103 '' ( \u201e monkey-tail '' ) but it fell out of favor for the shorter \u201e arond '' ( most likely a bastardization of the english \u201e around '' ) . 
   batterie and akku in german baterie vs acumulator / baterie re\u00eenc\u0103rcabil\u0103 ( \u201e rechargeable battery '' ), 
  yes and no . 
  depends on your native language first of all . 
  it 's easy for romance and germanic speakers , because it has a lot of elements of both , plus its grammar went through a lot of simplifications . 
  but verb tenses can be really bothersome for someone accustomed to a less of them . 
  also , learning all the irregular verbs can be annoying as fuck at first . 
  also , the spelling is all over the place . 
  the only ones i know , and the ones that pop up in movies the most are inches , feet , yards and miles . 
  for quick aproximations i use 1 inch = 2.5 cm , 1 foot = 1/3 meter , 1 yard = 0.9 meter , but sometimes i just go with 1 yard = 1 meter , and 1 mile = 1.6 km ( or if i have to multiply , i just go with 1.5 km and ad a few more km at the end ) . 
  romanian also has an academie , modeled on the french one , but it does n't bother itself with neologism in the sense that it does n't try to impose new ` romanian ' words instead of the english ones . 
  it just records the new english ones , and after a while , they morph , through use , into romanian words . 
  for example , the word `` derby '' enters the language . 
  after a while , the academy accepts it as a valid word , but with a foreign spelling . 
  then through ` misuse ' , both `` derby '' and the romanianized `` derbi '' become valid forms . 
  after a while , `` derbi '' just becomes more popular , as there is no more need to remember the weird foreign spelling , so the academy says that the ` romanianized ' version is ( native ) enough , and we do n't need the old one anymore . 
  there is not much linguistic purism , when compared to french . 
  sure , some people decry the invasion of english , but most people do n't bother with the fact that our language becomes `` impure '' . 
  we already know there are a lot of words from french , italian , various slavics , turkish , hungarian and whatnot , so a few english ones wo n't hurt . 
  at least afaik . 
  if i 'm wrong , please correct me . 
  trollusconi, 
  it kinda looks like a mosque , but not like the hagia sophia . 
  anyway , some people need a chill-pill . 
   for almost 500 years the principal mosque of istanbul , hagia sophia served as a model for many other ottoman mosques , such as the sultan ahmed mosque ( blue mosque of istanbul ) , the \u015eehzade mosque , the s\u00fcleymaniye mosque , the r\u00fcstem pasha mosque and the k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 ali pa\u015fa mosque . 
  also , there is the `` neither bad nor good '' camp , which differs from country to country .

  yep .

  yay , we made the news !, 
  * the 2013 budget and changes in taxes * the justice system ( appointing the head of the [ anti-corruption directorate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_anticorruption_directorate ) ) * mali/algeria ( 2 romanian hostages died ) * [ regionalization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administrative_divisions_of_romania#current_status ), 
   we are the same !, 
  do n't worry , i 'm not going to say this . 
   our languages are different , so are switzerland 's . 
  the serbs , croats and bosniaks spoke the same language , and that did n't stop them murdering each other . 
  hell , northern ireland is populated by two tribes practically indistinguishable from each other that very much hate each other despite language , significant ammount of culture , etc. 
   we 're not even very close to each other geographically alaska , hawaii , rest of the usa . 
   to top it all off , we know next to nothing about each others countries or cultures . 
  i know more about internet culture then the culture of some obscure ethnographic region of my country .
