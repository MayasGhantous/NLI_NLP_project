  but let 's not get carried away with the \u201e we know next to nothing about each other '' . 
  it sounds way more dramatic than it actually is . 
   if someone does not feel a kinsman-ship with someone else , you simply can not force them to have one . 
  nor do i want to . 
  but kinsmanship is dependent on many things . 
  not only the way things are , but they way people want things to be . 
  a common goal centered on the narrative of [ european values ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism ) . 
  nobody is forcing anything against your will , and afaik , you still have the option to leave the eu if you so wish . 
  but you have to realize something , this whole shebang is not about shared culture , language or any other nonsense like this . 
  this is about making a small calculation and coming to the conclusion that it 's more profitable to do things together then apart . 
  if this was about culture , the balkans would be members of the neo-ottoman union . 
  idiots !, 
   sounds quite imperialistic really . 
  the countries in europe who actually have been at the short end of an empire and actually know how it is to be a vassal do n't seem to think so . 
  i remember you getting uppity that others are making \u201e sneering comments '' . 
  would please offer me the cutesy of not being sarcastic ? 
   true democracy relies on the populace having knowledge . 
  so the problem is with the population , not necessarily with the eu government . 
  the romanian pm is going to hold a [ csat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_council_of_national_defense_%28romania%29 ) meeting to decide whether we join the operations in mali . 
  only problem is that the meeting will be on 5 february . 
   but that finally got scrapped @ the last elections . 
  why ? 
  [ see this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/16vkeq/so_this_is_whats_happening_to_a_bulgarian_party/c7zst60 ), 
   these people claim bulgarian ancestry afaik , one can vote in a nation 's elections if one has citizenship . 
  simply claiming ancestry does not give one the right to vote . 
  citizenship does ( irrespective of one 's knowledge of the official language ) . 
  does bulgarian law work differently ? 
  ( i 'm simply trying to figure out how turks from turkey can vote in bulgarian elections ), 
   this guy , dogan , in retaliation to the regime , blew up a fuckin ' train , full of women and children and everything . 
  could you cite some source ? 
  wikipedia seems to be very vague ( at best ) about this ( i checked multiple languages ) . 
   here 's what you need to know about his party - it is completely ethnically-based . 
  they win seats in parliament because 100 % of the turkish minority in bulgaria is behind them . 
  some more context : bulgaria bans ethnically based parties . 
  which , imo , is useless . 
  ( turkey also bans them , but , surprise surprise , the kurds also have a de facto ethnic party )  they gain even more seats through election fraud - bussing non-bulgarian turks into the country to vote for them every election . 
  how can non-citizens ( bulgarian turks in this case ) vote in bulgarian elections ? 
  xenophobia can be based on race , and then it 's racism , or on other things ( ethnicity , religion , social class , whatever ... ) and then it might have a different name, 
   checked my goole map link and it shows a 15 min walk it shows a 17 minute drive .

   generally muslims living in the west are more moderate . 
  also , [ the balkans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/yijjo/a_worldwide_pew_survey_finds_muslims_in_the/ ), 
  apparently , a lot of people have broken sarcasm detectors today . 
  australia for aborigines , new zealand for the maori , the americas for native americans ... oh wait . 
  for the curios , [ / r/architecture 's take on the zaha case ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/15up1b/architecture_pirates_in_china_may_finish_copycat/ ), 
  and : [ the turkish government and kurdish separatists have reportedly agreed on a plan to end a conflict that has killed over 40,000 people in over thirty years . 
  but there is controversy brewing over possible concessions . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.de/turkish-newspaper-reports-roadmap-for-peace-with-kurds/a-16507294 ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malian_ ( disambiguation ), 
  see [ this thread and first comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/16kmyt/chris_wayans_imaginary_europe_3000_ad_from/ ), 
  i wish debates would rise to this level in our parliament as well . 
   ultimately the war in mali is based on pre-existing ethnic tensions , and european powers getting involved in ethnic divisions has historically been a massive failure . 
  had the division remained ethnic , and not morphed into a jihad , i have the feeling france would have stayed out . 
   it must be remembered that afghanistan was in a state of civil war when nato rolled in plus the fact that the taliban regime [ was only recognized by pakistan , saudi arabia , and the united arab emirates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_emirate_of_afghanistan#international_relations ) . 
  yeah , and the residents of timbuktu [ do n't seem to mind the intervention ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21042561 ) . 
  see below . 
  mostly , other european countries have pledged transport aircrafts ( so far ) . 
  i think they are expecting ecowas troops to do the footwork . 
  i 'm not sure about other details . 
  also , other european countries are helping too . 
  * belgium - [ two transport aircrafts and two helicopters , one with medical equipment . 
  there are 75 soldiers involved ] ( http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=dmf20130114_085 ) * ( not sure if combat troops ) * * uk - [ two transport planes but no uk combat troops ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20999533 ) * germany - [ two military transport planes ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5glczvoiyof3xb-czrv3sf3nw_lya?docid=cng.686473089b00d35ee260e32043cd391d.1b1 ) * denmark - [ one transport aircraft ] ( http://politiken.dk/politik/ece1867670/danmark-sender-transportfly-ind-i-kampene-i-mali/ ) * spain - [ one transport aircraft ] ( http://www.abc.es/espana/20130114/rc-espana-ofrece-avion-transporte-201301141451.html ) + us and canada it 's not much , but it is something . 
  the war had to be sped up as islamists in northern mali started to push south . 
  france was already preparing for war , but i think [ together with an ecowas army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african-led_international_support_mission_to_mali ) . 
  the ecowas army was not ready when the islamists started their push ( the north mali situation had been static for some months ) . 
  so france started the war solo , and the ecowas guys are quickly scrambling to get on the ground as well ( they were supposed to be ready in autumn ) . 
  i do n't think that one can stop irredentism by forcing a name change . 
   perhaps a more apt analogy would be austria calling itself bavaria i think germany is mature enough not to panic and go into a hissy fit . 
  a beter analogy , i 'd say , is republic of moldova versus the romanian region of moldova . 
  or even better : [ luxembourg ( country ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg ) vs [ luxembourg ( region ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg_ ( belgium ) ) . 
  but since no analogy is perfect , i 'm sure somebody will find some reason why these do not apply . 
   on top of that pile on 100 years of wandering borders in the balkans current attitudes of \u201e omg they stealz our history '' an such really are among the things that made the balkans so violence prone . 
  i 'm quite sure that if greece would have behaved normally when fyrom declared independence , levels of macedonian nationalism would have been way lower then they are today . 
   can you even see in the big picture instead of playing the skopjan advocate ? 
  yes . 
  narrow minded people arguing about irrelevant fables . 
   are you now pretending to be english too ? 
  i 'm a albanian-macedonian-turkish-liechtensteiner . 
   if not , how do you think of the idea of calling skopja the south romania ? 
  sure . 
  whatever . 
  there is a region in italy called romagna , a language in switzerland called romansch , and there was a time when byzantine greeks called themselves romaioi . 
  i do n't care . 
  my identity is not threatened by trivial things like this . 
  did you know there is a region in romania called moldova , and right across from it there is a country called moldova ? 
   it 's only natural that when ( for example ) mexico starts calling itself `` texas '' , some people will get pissed right the fuck off funny you should mention mexico . 
  there is a new mexico right across the border in the us . 
  and there are californias accross both borders . 
   the `` we 're macedonians '' phenomenon is a recent attempt to establish a national identity . 
  yes . 
  i 'm not going to argue it 's not , when it 's a much more recent national identity , compared to its neighbors . 
  what a beautiful little narrative you 've constructed for yourself . 
  but you are using those ethnonyms anachronistically and talking as if national identities in the modern sense existed pre-mid-19th-century . 
  i 'm not going to go any further given your high degree of conspiratorial thinking . 
  * this message was paid for by the `` steal macedonia from the greeks '' foundation * . 
   they downright steal our identity . 
  i 'm sorry for you if your identity is so weak you can hold onto it only by claiming copyright . 
  yes , one could argue that , but then again , financing is not the same as endorsing the content ( over which they most probably would not have control anyway ) . 
   i personally do n't like this carnival because we live in era of political correctness and the irony is understood like mocking and it causes problems .
