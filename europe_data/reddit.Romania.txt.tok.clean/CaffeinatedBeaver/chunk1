   i like plane crashes i ca n't believe you said that . 
  you are a sick , sick man !, 
  because you do n't get the point , as evidenced by your replies above . 
  it does n't matter whether or not al jazeera is biased because , in this case , both the guy you initially replied to and al jazeera were quoting the metropolitan police . 
  so , unless they fudged the quote , which they did n't ( hence my link ) , your argument is - at best - irrelevant in this context . 
  do n't feed the troll , caralho !, 
  make policing great again !, 
  unbiased news source ? 
  they 're literally quoting the metropolitan police service !, 
  assistant commissioner mark rowley , to be exact . 
  probably because the [ firearms officers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/authorised_firearms_officer ) that arrived on the scene decided a taser is enough to subdue him and a proportionate response ?

  rest in peace . 
  i 'm not a fan of monarchy at all , but i always liked her and king michael . 
  ah , i can almost smell the bitumen . 
   looks well organised too , which makes me very happy . 
  hopefully the work lasts . 
   i am so sick of this pc bullshit switch to mac . 
  hard to tell where the trolling stops and where the bigotry starts . 
  i 'm sure this has nothing to do with you . 
   as a matter of fact they should deport cousins and their families as well . 
  i have plenty of relatives that i do n't keep in touch with at all ( cousins included ) . 
  i assume they 're all still alive , since i did n't hear otherwise , but apart from that i 'm clueless about them . 
  according to you , i 'm somehow liable for their beliefs and actions . 
  and btw , these extremists put their families at risk when they know they could be the target of drone strikes , but you somehow think that the threat of deportation will deter them . 
  it 's not citizenship . 
  gorgeous ships . 
  one day i 'll have to move my ass and travel to one of these events .

   and then the ** mass rape ** at 31st of december happend in germany and it was a ** perfect `` penalty '' for germany ** . 
  it had such a big meaning , a `` country '' that wants to control everything in europe , but ca n't even handle their own problems . 
  you really are twisted , mate . 
  it 's not often that a comment on the internet literally makes my skin crawl . 
  ok , i see your point then . 
  to an extent , yes . 
  most russian military aircraft transiting european airspace are transport aircraft , usually filing a flightplan and being handled by civilian atc . 
  in other words , business as usual . 
  in the case of military training flights or so-called `` spy '' missions , not so much , but they should do a bare minimum to communicate with the facility responsible for that section of airspace and have their transponders on , so that atc knows what 's going on and can vector traffic around them . 
  when that does n't happen , it 's normal to intercept them and then complain about their rule violations . 
  i see you 've now started spamming this one question and your standard reply to that other user trying to explain things to you is little more than `` no , lol '' , so i see no point in continuing the conversation . 
  sofia fir * is * bulgaria 's responsibility ( see my other reply ) . 
  national airspace is another kettle of fish and fortunately it 's not violated as often as some press articles would lead one to believe , but what happens in the ( rest of the ) fir matters too . 
  you ca n't have unidentified , unpredictable , non-communicating aircraft fly about in the airspace you manage , they pose risk to all users of that airspace . 
  that 's why fighters are scrambled to investigate and shadow them . 
  what nonsense are you peddling now ? 
  bulgaria did n't annex a part of international airspace any more than rostov , khabarovsk or other area control centres in russia did . 
  is [ shanwick oceanic control ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shanwick_oceanic_control ) an irish plot to annex international airspace over the atlantic ? 
  these airspace boundaries are established by icao and agreed by its members ( incl . 
  bulgaria and russia ) . 
  as for bulgaria 's area of responsibility , i 'm not gon na repeat myself , it 's been [ discussed in another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uds1c/bulgaria_calls_rise_in_airspace_violations_by/d5pmfh4 ) , but that 's nothing suspicious or abusive either . 
  good for them if they had their transponders on in this instance , it 's only normal , but when incidents like this happen , they fly with them off , file no flightplans with the relevant authorities and pose a risk to civilian air traffic . 
  i do n't know why anybody would defend such behaviour . 
  does the article really matter ? 
  it 's an ongoing nato mission since 2004 , not much to say as long as everything goes well . 
   english when we 've left the eu and stuck two fingers up to it ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  yes , english , of course . 
  i 'm sure you 've flown plenty of times and thus used a complex international system based primarily on english . 
  from the instruments aboard the aircraft , to the checklists the pilots use , to the standardised communication between pilots and the multitude of area control centres , as well as between the various air traffic facilities themselves , some multinational , like maastricht uac - it 's all based on english and often conducted exclusively in english ( though it 's not the only icao language ) . 
  as for the military , english is used a lot already . 
  how do you think all those nato [ air policing missions ] ( https://youtu.be/6j1jynzyr0s ) are coordinated ? 
  combined air operations centre in uedem , germany ? 
  nato e-3a component 's multinational crews ? 
  what about the major combat operations in bosnia , serbia , iraq , libya , syria etc. ? 
  eu 's operation atalanta ? 
  countless nato/pfp exercises ? 
  all this is not perfect , of course , but it 's been working for decades and , as more and more people learn english , it 's going to be less and less of a problem . 
  why does it even matter if britain leaves the eu or not ? 
   what does `` bulgaria 's area of responsibility in nato airspace '' mean ? 
  it means sofia [ fir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_information_region ) * , which is bordered by bucharest , simferopol ( kyiv uir ) and istanbul firs over the black sea . 
  it covers bulgaria 's national airspace ( territory + national waters up to 12 nm from shore ) and a lot more for the purposes of air traffic management and safety . 
  since most articles are all over the place regarding aviation topics , it 's unclear how many of these incidents occurred in national airspace and how many occurred in the international airspace part of sofia fir . 
  either way , them turning off their transponders shows disregard for civilian air traffic safety and is concerning enough on its own . 
  * you can see the airspace on [ skyvector ] ( https://skyvector.com/?ll=42.844959602622446,29.230773938888692&amp;chart=301&amp;zoom=5 ) . 
  i know . 
  however , i only had to wear one for the first few years , as they went away before i got to grade 5 . 
  i was talking about my experience . 
  nah , mate , what the world needs less are twats like you . 
   people have no idea how much children get bullied because of their appearance and what they wear .
