  either way , lynching soldiers who have surrendered is completely barbaric and bad enough from my point of view , beheading or not . 
  have we reached peak erdogan ? 
  well , hello to you too , sir . 
  have a marvellous evening !, 
  human wave attacks , if needed . 
  who cares , it 's easy to shitpost and play armchair general , is n't it ? 
  at worst you get some downvotes , no biggie . 
  you sound like you know a lot about wwii . 
  please , shit more on the french army of wwii , the resistance and their dead . 
  are n't natives the overwhelming majority in all european countries ? 
  i actually agree , these posts do n't make you racist ; we ca n't infer racism merely based on them or at least i ca n't , if i 'm being extra rigurous ( pedantic even , some might say ) . 
  however , some food for thought , maybe ... [ out-group homogeneity effect ] ( http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/outgroup-homogeneity-effect/ ) * outgroup homogeneity effect is a bias where people tend to see outgroup members as more alike than ingroup members . 
  this can make outgroup members more likely to be stereotyped . 
  * different issue , similar result , i 'm afraid . 
  well , that 's nice of you , but given that you apparently care about europe , why are you so happy for hungary to just push them across the border , into serbia ? 
  they 're not in the eu ( yet ) , but they 're still a european country , so what 's your solution in the end ? 
  you already made a blanket statement that they simply do n't belong to europe so , based on that , i assume some sort of sorting facilities abroad are out of the question . 
  correct ? 
  edit : your post has 91 points as of this moment . 
  so much for downvoting . 
  * metric martyrs * . 
  the mind boggles . 
  you sound like a pleasant chap . 
   and all the ` vote leave ' morons on twitter are claiming it 's lies , even tho the information is coming from the police fores around the country . 
  well , clearly the police are project fear . 
  they watched too many serial killer movies . 
  not everyone who despises nationalism `` had antinationalism beat into them '' . 
  it 's more of a rational conclusion that comes with examining its tenets and history . 
  horrible across the board imo , except for slovenia and luxembourg . 
  at least romania ranks a bit better than i was expecting , so there 's that ... 
  beautiful . 
  rip . 
  and apparently you 'll be fucked if reactionaries like this guy above hold any sort of real power . 
  single because you 're not in a relationship or because - you know , with the war and all - your girlfriend died ? 
  no living parents to come with you or they 're stubborn and want to stay whatever the cost ? 
  lost your id or living in a country where id is harder to get ? 
  haha , fuck right off !, 
  i also like how he ignores that in pretty much all wars ( including wwii ) , some people fled and some people did indeed stay behind , although some ( many ? ), 
  did so because they had little choice . 
  romania has `` page 5 girl '' . 
  ** erdogan and putin speak on the phone - reports ** turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has spoken on the phone with his russian counterpart vladimir putin after the shooting , reuters reports , quoting cnn turk . 
  ** russia : no weakening of ties with turkey ** `` there will be no fresh cooling in relations between moscow and ankara , no matter how strongly our strategic opponents in ankara and the west want this , '' said leonid slutsky , who heads the international affairs committee of the russian duma .

   everyone is walking on eggshells * rolleyes *, 
   the rules say `` everything is allowed . 
  fighting , alcohol , murder , rape , ** smoking ** , anything . '' good heavens , smoking !, 
  world 's gone mental !, 
  thanks . 
  this explains the black band in your flag . 
  fascinating . 
  also , apparently poland and estonia are mordor i and mordor ii . 
  * welcome . 
  welcome to city 17 . 
  * * you have chosen , or been chosen , to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers . 
  i thought so much of city 17 that i elected to establish my administration here , in the citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors . 
  i have been proud to call city 17 my home . 
  and so , whether you are here to stay , or passing through on your way to parts unknown , welcome to city 17 . 
  it 's safer here . 
  it means red , white and blue !, 
  pay attention !, 
  they also lack any significant aa capability , i do n't know what he 's on about . 
  the limited one they have is only useful against other helicopters , as well as transports and attack aircraft in limited situations . 
  you need fighters on [ quick reaction alert ( qra ) ] ( https://www.airn.nato.int/page5931922/-nato-air-policing ) 24/7 , since you need to be able to control and secure the airspace you 're responsible for . 
  attack helicopters are n't designed for that . 
  this reply summed it up well . 
  hilariously sad overreaction . 
   it was about some bill in the united states that granted women the right to vote yes , it was about the [ 19th amendment to the us constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nineteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) . 
  buzz aldrin was also hospitalised . 
  the mig-21 and the draken had slightly higher top speed , but aside from that , the f/a -18 is a good enough interceptor . 
  with the f-14 long gone , it 's been used in this role successfully by the us navy , let alone canada , australia , spain , switzerland etc. 
  good interceptor and an awesome strike platform proven in combat . 
  it should be noted that : ** 1 ) ** your previous post , which could very well have been the title of an article , uses the plural `` agents '' , even though you 've only referenced one . 
  also , the way it 's worded , easily induces the idea that it 's because their former stasi experience that these agents are used , which might or might not be true . 
  ** 2 ) ** you do n't know what `` source '' means , given you failed to provide one . 
  ** 3 ) ** when using your post as google query , first result i get is from wikipedia . 
  please note the sources on the subsequent ones - http://imgur.com/a/etaev, 
  make kartupelis great again !, 
  it 's like watching two edgy redditors . 
  he has a very good brain . 
  people tell him all the time . 
  except french people . 
  they 're dumb . 
  sad . 
   i know a thing or two about france 's military  france could n't fight its way out of a wet paper bag  they 're not good compared to the good armies hilarious . 
  well , for one thing , estonia wants those french troops . 
  i 'm sure that if they wanted russian troops , they 'd kindly invite them and maybe be in some sort of military alliance with them . 
  so ... there 's that ^ and ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ more . 
  being mean was n't my intention and i do n't see where i insulted you personally . 
  on the other hand , i 'm also not comfortable with waxing lyrically about russia 's `` securing '' of ( ukrainian ! ), 
  naval facilities when what they really did was simply to invade a country and `` take their shit '' . 
  the part where i mentioned whataboutism and precedents should 've been clearer ; my bad . 
  i was n't accusing you of doing it , which is why i said `` even if '' , i was only preempting a potential line of argumentation which is extremely popular .
