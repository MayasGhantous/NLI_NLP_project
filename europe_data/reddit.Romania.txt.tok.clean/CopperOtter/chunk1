well , depends on what you 're spending it and the private hospital of your choice , of course . 
  examples : hernia operation - 1700eur ( includes 4 days hospitalization ) , colonoscopy - 220eur ( 1 day ) , phototherapy for babies 45eur/day ( hospitalization and treatment ) , pneumonectomy - 5100eur ( 13 days included ) . 
  seems that a patient would pay about 133eur per day to stay in [ this hospital ] ( http://www.spitalpelican.ro/spitale/spital-clinic-oradea/servicii-tarife-spital-clinic/ ) - there you can find more prices , text is in romanian and the prices are in ron ( divide it by 4.5 to get the price in euro ) - also , look for the prices in the `` pre\u021b neasigura\u021bi '' column , those are the prices for uninsured people . 
  depending on what kind of hospital you go to , the prices per day for hospitalization does seem to vary , ranging from 25 eur to 250eur . 
  i imagine you 'd have to have some pretty serious health issues to get your health care costs at about 3-4k euros a year . 
  i 'm curious and rather ignorant , does polish law say that a company is not allowed to censor their product as they see fit ? 
  if that 'd be the case , i 'd love to find out if the same thing would go for other things : nudity , sexually explicit materials , gore or similarly disturbing things ( be them diseases , infections or what have you ) . 
  if that 'd be the case , it 'd be hilarious if facebook would be forced to allow such material . 
  nice try , china . 
  god , how i love la sagrada familia , such a stunning , gorgeous piece of art . 
  while i think that it would definitely be a step back for romania , i vehemently doubt that would the beginning of the end . 
  i find that slowly , yet surely , the society is growing more sick and tired of bribery and corruption , and people themselves do less of it and accept less of it . 
  society is changing . 
  it 's indeed a long process , but i doubt that would mark the end of it , if anything it might stoke the fire even more . 
  i was already thinking about hungary as it was mentioned in the top comment . 
  - me , except with countries/flags . 
   ridf is strong in this subreddit . 
  what is ridf ? 
   we are getting almost daily anti-corruption threads in romania news stories . 
  yes , because , romania is trying to form a habit out of jailing its corrupted officials , and so far its been pretty successful . 
  i do n't get what are you saying here ? 
  that we should n't post about how anti-corruption goes in romania ? 
  that we should n't jail as many corrupt officials as we do ? 
  what is it ? 
  jealousy or what ? 
  bring l\u00e1ngos and p\u00e1linka and you 're in . 
  i say we make a balkans anti-corruption unit ( bau ) and we put her in charge . 
  only 320 pages ? 
  that sounds too small . 
  i 've read it when i was young , so ca n't remember the number of pages , but what i do remember was that it was split in 3 volumes and they were pretty thick themselves . 
  perhaps you read only a certain part of it or it very well could be the case that you read a shortened versions of it , i 've seen that with other books . 
  thought and talked about that as well . 
  still kinda think that i 'm wrong . 
  explanation : canada has official bilingualism , meaning both english and french are the official languages of the country , therefor in that case any such official papers would be needed in both english & french . 
  it could very well be that the two books are written in canada 's two official languages . 
  was aiming more for a thickness comparison , but you 're absolutely right !, 
  after discussing it in the thread , i do think my initial assumption was wrong . 
  i 'm inclined to believe that due to canada 's particular case , that of being an official bilingual country ( both english & french being the official languages ) , makes sense that the ceta deal would be drafted in both of those languages , the one opened in french and the one next to it in english . 
  [ i do n't know how else i could 've said that !, 
  noticed that as well . 
  i figure since canada has official bilingualism , thus both french and english being the official languages , such documents need to be both in english and french ? 
  yeah , i just came across that info and edited the comment 13 minutes ago , 2 minutes before you posted yourself !, 
  that 's what i also thought at first , but no : https://twitter.com/isabruss/status/793147549909655552, 
  thanks !, 
  so my initial assumption was right , the lisbon treaty is in all 24 languages of the eu , makes sense that ceta would be the same . 
  someone mentioned below that this could be the trade deal in all 24 languages put together in chunks for the publicity shot , and i 'm inclined to believe that 'd be the case . 
  that or some sort of big file-holder meant to keep all versions in one place for whatever purposes ( archiving ? 
  that 's a valid point and i 'm inclined to believe that 'd be the case . 
  either made it for the publicity shot or a custom file-holder of some sort meant to hold the treaty in all its various languages in one place ( for archiving purposes ? 
  that 's an interesting point and i 'm not still completely sure if that 's the case , merely because of the following snippet found on [ europa.eu ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-13-825_en.htm ) ** is every eu-document translated into all official languages ? 
  documents are translated according to established priorities : these depend on the target audience and the purpose . 
  ** legislation and documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all 24 official languages . 
  ** other documents ( e.g. 
  correspondence with national authorities and decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities ) are translated only into the languages needed . 
  the european commission conducts its internal business in three ` procedural ' languages -- english , french and german . 
  ______ i would consider this to be a document of major public importance , then again i 'm still not completely sure as i lack plenty of info in that regard . 
  good grief , some of the comments on there are cancer . 
  i believe it includes all eu languages . 
  if you zoom in on the lower part of the book it contains chunks of paper that appear to be stuck together . 
  the treaty has ~ [ 1600 pages ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) , [ the executioner 's song ] ( https://athomewithlondon.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_6671.jpg ) by norman mailer has a little over 1000 pages , while victor hugo 's [ les miserables ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i0hgg8edtzw/t980upio1ti/aaaaaaaacii/khh2nuhkmlc/s1600/img_8659.jpg ) has almost 1500 pages and about the same for gone with the wind . 
  however , if anyone has a different take on it or extra info , i 'll be happy to stand corrected . 
  ** edit : i was wrong . 
  so very wrong . 
   before brexit while the referendum might as well validate some racist/bigoted views , it would be not only unfair to say that whatever spike in such attitudes happened only after the day of the vote when in truth , both media and politicians have been blindly pushing anti-immigrants views for years upon years , from messages ranging from immigrants steal our jobs , immigrants are lazy and only come to uk to be handed cash , and a myriad of other lies and deceitful , manipulative messages . 
  and in the following years , if uk 's departure from eu leads to an economic downturn , which unfortunately i heavily tend to believe it 'll happen so , i can only see this attitude towards `` others '' ( whoever others might be ) only worsen as it 's always easy to blame others . 
   so nothing has changed then ? 
  :d well , you guys better decide , before it was `` uk has no power in eu '' , the other day may insisted that uk is one of eu 's biggest powers and `` uk can vote and ban on eu regulation '' and now you 're back to `` no one listens to us '', 
  well , i find it fitting . 
  especially now that we got rid of u. 
  i think that what you linked actually confirms the study that i previously linked . 
  both the site and the study place the total at about 55 % when it comes to internet connectivity . 
  however that was not the topic , but actual broadband penetration in rural areas , of which the site you linked does not mention at all . 
  the overall internet penetration rate is not related to broadband penetration rate , in other words country x can have 100 % rural internet penetration rate but have 0 % rural broadband penetration rate ( they simply have lower speed internet ) , while country y can have 10 % rural penetration rate and have 10 % rural broadband ( all rural connection is broadband ) , thus when it comes to rural broadband country y has a greater penetration rate than country x. 
  i searched again and came across [ this study done by google ] ( http://www.delab.uw.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/delab-raport-b5-romania.pdf ) page 18 shows households that use fiber-optic cable connection , about 55 % of the total of households use advanced broadband technology , and a little bit above 20 % of the households in rural areas have broadband . 
  so , no , i believe you are incorrect , judging by broadband penetration in the rural area romania 's no . 
  4 , behind estonia , lithuania and latvia . 
  internet penetration is close to 60 % in the rural areas , there do n't seem to be figures concerning the coverage of high speed internet in rural areas ( or i did n't find them ) , but i think it 's safe to assume that a great portion of those 60 % have access to it , especially the villages that are close to cities . 
   romania is more problems than it worth . 
  i 've heard of plenty of brits say the very same thing about france . 
  i do wonder , what if uk wanted the power to make france shut up and do as they 're told . 
  you do really seem to hate equality , mate . 
  how very nice of you . 
  is that tradition in your country ? 
  you literally have n't got the slightest clue of what the eu is if that 's how you think about it . 
  literally , never , absolutely never will the eu reform in such a way that would permit a country to be subdued and have its voice shut down in such a way . 
  yup , literally how we/romanians spell it : `` europa '' ( the same for italians , spaniards , and many others ), 
   i do n't think so . 
  nope . 
  wrong , wrong , wrong . 
   sweden is lost . 
  again ? 
  bloody hell , mate , i keep telling you to mind where you 're putting it . 
  if you did so you would n't be losing it all the bloody time . 
  romania might be driving those numbers up big time . 
  sorry guys , we 're trying to fix that . 
   the conservative counselor who wants to officially brand calls for the uk to rejoin the eu treason was a new high in that respect . 
  he actually supports that , lol . 
  `` well tbf supporting a vile elitist corporatist supranational organisation over your own country , could constitute treason . '', 
   will spend a night with #two greek dude . 
  if only .
