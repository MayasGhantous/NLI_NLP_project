  britain is not a nation of rationalists and the british public says `` pigs can fly '' they 'd sooner redefine the words `` pig '' `` can '' and `` fly '' than acquiesce to an opposing opinion . 
  did n't you just say `` the mistake i see a lot of people making is that they treat the uk like a collective . '', 
  are you mental , mate ? 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  you go on how europeans treat you like a collective and how they should n't and then you finish up with `` do n't tell us what to do or we 'll do it just cuz '' ? 
  that 's just fucking brain-dead retarded . 
  seriously . 
  why are you painting brits as irrationals ? 
  as the type of people that 'll do something just out of pure spit without even thinking shit ?? 
  do you think that 's a quality or something ? 
   we need to keep this on topic and not start nationality bashing . 
  fucking great . 
  awesome that you say that and mere words later you say that brits do things out of spite . 
  christ . 
  ahhh , aye , aye , totally misinterpreted the post , dude . 
  my bad . 
  lots of triggered ones in the comments . 
  but guys , guys , guyes , listen , hey ** listen ** , listen . 
  could it . . could it be , that mods are fucking with you on the accounts of 1st of april ? 
  yeah , that 's a good way to go about it , i 'm usually a skeptic . 
  what helps improve credibility greatly in the case of that map is that most dots are accompanied by either pictures or videos and that the events that they report ( such as arrests , gas grenades , riot police , beatings , etc ) are or can be corroborated by others or police , etc. 
  well , i see that as a site that 's somewhat slanted towards eu and against russia , so it 's no wonder to me that they 'd do that to hype up the viewer . 
  but even when you ignore that obvious bias , shit seems to be going down in russia , especially once you consider putin 's draconian ways of handling protests , opposition and critics . 
  i 've seen many paint events as coincidences , however i do not believe in that . 
  the seem to be accurate , with all the video and picture evidence and all , y' know . 
  portugal , are you sure you want to go down the look-at-how-many-people-they-killed road ? 
  i 'd have no problem with japan invading . 
  * i mean obscene hentai and excessively polite people !, 
  what 's not to love ? 
  [ i wonder if it was as awesome as that woman calling a barnstable/usa instead of barnstable/uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi5idbwp8tg ), 
  of course , of course !, 
  they are indeed monsters !, 
  how else would poor , tiny putin have the time to manufacture myths and legends about him diving to the depths of the seas and miraculously surfacing with ancient artifacts !, 
  * so very inconsiderate !, 
   nope , are just info oh , of course , of course . 
  because anyone who visits a site takes time to notice what hosting services the site use , since that 's highly relevant information . 
  however , do tell please , the comment [ you posted below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/605prp/in_russua_school_pupil_has_been_taken_from/df3nffm/ ) :  bla bla bla what did you mean by that ? 
  lol , i think he 's arguing against the owner of the domain because she 's using an american service - cloudflare . 
  lol . 
  not serious , right ? 
  these days i can never tell, 
  that was really good !, 
  oh sorry , i was totally talking about romania !, 
  worded it wrongly , my bad !, 
  apparently so do aussies and finns . 
  what kind of nonsense is this !? 
  i 'm starting to think that the extreme temperatures are to blame . 
  i 'll have to agree with the yanks , it 's really weird . 
  i 'd be curious to learn just how pineapple pizza got so popular in finland , i read a while back that a canadian of greek descent was the one that created the pineapple pizza and despite being named `` hawaiian pizza '' , a german study determined that hawaiians do not enjoy pineapple on their pizzas at all , but hey ... it 's apparently really , really popular in australia . 
  do n't do that to me , i like the fins too much . 
  wow , so many recipes include pineapple . 
  do you know why ? 
  i mean , fins and pineapple , how does that make any sense ? 
  that does n't make any sense !, 
  what got you on this terrible path in life ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/zqkkkue.gif that just does n't make sense . 
  absolutely no sense at all . 
  how would he eat it ? 
  pick up the floating ketchup and fish soup in a spoon and slurp it up ? 
  [ that thought alone . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ixzotbk.gif ), 
  well , i 'm a bit biased against that since i hate ketchup no matter where you put it . 
  tomato sauce is the way to go . 
  * no , serbia , no !, 
   people use it in the privacy of their houses , not while being/having guests . 
  actually that 's not right , it 's custom here to have several sets of slippers ( usually the kinds made of cloth ) to give guests after they take off their shoes . 
   string-emil i had no idea who that was and i googled him . 
  i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for introducing me to this first world wonder . 
   pineapple on his pizza what kind of monster does that ? 
  at first you need to climb up the cliff before you get to jump off it . 
  i think the crescent 's due to the mountain range that 's smack-down right in the middle of our country , mate . 
  that was fantastic !, 
  pissed myself laughing . 
  god , i love the scottish . 
   why is talking about american politics one of the examples of whats against the rules when all this subreddit talks about , even in this post , is american politics ? 
  first of all , / u/cocacolacrusade2 this is / r/europe and these wagons are in germany , germany is in europe , soooo that 's why this post is here , ya feel me ? 
  second of all , really , is that *** all *** this post talks about ? 
  are you *** suuuure *** ? 
  you did n't miss the uk 's pm may , putin , kaczynksi , orban , the german afd party , kaczynski - poland , merkel - mammutti , did ya ? 
  we have plenty of corruption !, 
  but we 're getting rid of it , sure , takes time and effort and the road is n't always smooth or straight , but fuck it , one way or the other , we 'll get rid of it . 
  just one ? 
  christ , no . 
  we 'd fill the whole carnival space !, 
   no , not different . 
  jobs will not be happy to see anything dealing with liberty getting fucked . 
  let your boss see that picture at work and see what happens . 
  this needs to be nsfw not only for precaution , but also because you can get in a hell of a lot of trouble for having a picture of trump fucking liberty at your job . 
  well , no longer have any boss , but if i were at my lost job , not only he 'd see it and laugh , but i 'd deliberately share it to him and ask him to look . 
  but that 's not the point here , it really is n't an explicit drawing , it 's cartoonish as hell , it shows no genitalia , it implies rape but in such an absurdly minimal way . 
  for christ 's sake , i used to watch cartoons of pepe le pew which depicted a skunk insistently harassing the cat , this is n't that much of a deal , honestly . 
  maybe europeans are more permissive than americans . 
  again , you seem to insist and i 'll do the same : you 're wrong , it 's not that . 
  those are not pictures of a decapitated head or trump fucking liberty , they are pictures of cartoon-ish depictions of such acts , entirely different . 
  similarly to why in the movies the gory details are n't censored , because they are not recordings of real events , in other words they are faked out by actors , unlike pictures or movies that might be displayed on the news that show actual dead humans or gory details , which are real . 
  do you comprehend the difference ? 
  in case you did n't get it the first 5 times , this carnival has been about politics since forever . 
  you 're welcome . 
  ahhh !, 
  that makes sense now !, 
  oh my god .
