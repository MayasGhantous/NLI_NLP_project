  thank you , finnish is the best language in the whole fucking world . 
  dude , i clicked the post specifically to ask whether that image was photoshopped or if they messed with the color balance thinking that the sand looked too white . 
  and that 's exactly where i think eu fails , honestly . 
  eu needs to brag more , way way way more . 
  as if . 
  have no idea why , but that was the bit that cracked me up . 
   i am a german and i can give you thousands of sources saying that they are trying to do it now . 
  i 'll take you on that offer . 
  namely the one about thousands of sources , since its plural i expect at least 2000 sources . 
  thanks !,

  call them spanish and tell them that their language evolved from spanish !, 
  that 'll piss them off and keep them busy for a while !,

  romania with a little bit of hungary in it . 
  seems legit to me . 
  would n't that actually be a cause of concern , though ? 
  boe tried to lower the pound , admittedly not successfully , but let 's say that they would 've managed to do so - that very thing would have been ideal because british institutions would actually be in control of the pound 's value . 
  i get that a weaker pound is good for britain and that other countries ( switzerland did or used to , i 'm in no way up to speed with it ) control their currencies in order to aid local businesses and i 'm in no way opposed to the practice , but in this case how does it benefit britain in the long run ? 
  let 's say that you achieve a certain value for the pound that 's ideal for exports , how do you control it , stop it for dropping further ? 
  is boe capable of such ? 
  eh , i think it 's more of a `` guilty by association '' kind of deal that they 're trying to pull here . 
  anyway , it 's british media so it 's to expected . 
  i mentioned to the other commenter , my issue was not with the differences between the rail models/systems , but the arrogant portrayal of the other countries and i 'm absolutely sure that it 's meant to be interpreted in a way in which the europeans are mocking the brits . 
  was actually referring to the arrogant , `` holier-than-thou '' characters they used to depict the other countries . 
  * i 'm absolutely sure that the viewers will interpret those in a positive manner , just as i 'm sure that if it were the other way around there would n't be any single briton to call it out as ` racist/anti-uk ' . 
  oh look , more anti-european propaganda . 
  reminded me of this nice one here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiyq5xmw98i, 
  oh no , man , it 's alright , we 're a bit of a weird case from that point of view , cause if you look at the [ map of romance languages in europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/latin_europe.png/1024px-latin_europe.png ) we 're pretty isolated , in fact we 're the only romance language in eastern europe . 
  the christianity thing is also weird , 'cause you get plenty of evidence of it around the 3rd and 4th century , but then when you get to the 7th to the 10th centuries it all kinda goes radio silence , the evidence for christian communities goes scarce ; and then you get the great schism and christianity separates . 
   i do n't know about romania , but greeks are not so religious . 
  of course if you ask them if they are christian they will say yes , but it 's just cultural like rest of europe . 
  yeah , about the same thing goes here as well . 
  people are religious mostly on paper and do n't really attend church unless it 's a big event ( easter , weddings , christening ) . 
  but , but , very importantly - people do follow the orthodox calendar , especially if they bare the name of a saint ; for example my middle name comes from the `` florii '' = `` palm sunday '' in english , celebrated in the sunday before easter ; cause that 's a reason to party or getting gifts and we sure as hell wo n't miss out on that . 
  at least from what i 've seen , most of the people that go to church ( and we do have a fuckload of those churches , short explanation : corruption ) are the [ old ladies ] ( https://img.dollo.ro/2012/12/babe-biserica.jpg ) . 
  even though we share the same religion , you guys are so , so much ahead of us in many areas ( despite the temporary `` bad waters '' ) . 
  i was so happy to hear [ rotting christ 's rendition of `` cine iubeste si lasa '' with souzana vougioukli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmt4sdf-odm ) ( hopefully got her name right ) - it 's just so *** goddamn good . 
  *** * edit : `` cine iubeste si lasa '' roughly translates to '' ( he/she ) who loves and leaves '' and it 's commonly interpreted as a curse/spell . 
   however i still would like to see rt materials , and judge them by myself . 
  as i do with cnn and others . 
  oh , yeah , i get you , that 's why i browse different subs . 
  however i wish that such videos or articles shining a light on propagandist , manipulative or emotional manipulative articles would be more popular thus paving the way for better quality journalism . 
  edit : formatting . 
  from what i 've seen so far rt tends to intentionally lie or manipulate quite often and i 'm not sure i could say the same thing about cnn , even though i do n't like cnn - and they do manipulate as well , however i do n't think it 's nowhere near on the same level as rt. 
  last thing i watched in this regard was about a story where a rt reporter went in japan to get the japanese people 's opinions on putin . 
  it 's very interesting , i watched that video before , without the guy 's commentary , and i thought it was weird that the reporter asked `` when you see this , what do you think ? '', 
  while showing a picture of putin . 
  that 's not a normal question when you 're trying to get someone 's opinion on a world-wide-known political figure . 
  but that was it , that 's the only thing that stroke me as odd . 
  however the guy commenting on the rt video brought up another interesting matter of which i had no idea ( generally ignorant to many cultural details in japan ) , the reporter was deliberately showing pictures of putin wearing black glasses and that , apparently , is associated with yakuza/gangs/criminals by the japanese , thus explaining why japanese people responded with `` scary '' when asked `` what do you think about this ? '', 
  and `` what do you feel when you see this ? '', 
  that would mean that you 're okay with uk being criticized on the matter of human rights and the path the gov takes in that sense , correct ? 
   i just was n't buying into the self-hating brit stuff . 
   wait , what , lol ? 
  you mean to argue that saying that your government doing shit is bad equals `` self-hating brit '' ? 
  is that what you 're saying or i 'm reading it all wrong . 
  if not , what exactly does `` self-hating brit '' refer to ? 
  what does it mean ? 
   our minister of economy is actively trying to get himself fired . 
  can you elaborate more on that , please ? 
   and 100 % of people who moan about the uk have european flairs i feel triggered . 
  well then , i say , it 's time for a change .

  color me curious , do you surround yourself with individuals that talk to you and address you like that in real life ? 
  if so , i 'd love to hear more general details about it , who are these people to you ?
