  at least concerning horsemanship therapy for children/individuals on the autistic spectrum , i 've previously heard about it and it is legit , one study [ here ] ( http://envisiontherapy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/effect_therapeutic_horseback_riding_social_functioning_children_autism_paper.pdf ) . 
  `` we found that children exposed to equine assisted activities exhibited greater sensory seeking , sensory sensitivity , social motivation , and less inattention , distractibility and sedentary behaviors . 
  the results provide preliminary evidence that equine assisted activities may be a viable option in treating these children . '', 
  keep in mind that i did n't advocate for cheapest housing there is . 
  the price difference however would be more than worth it . 
  and since we 're on the topic of money , cheap & ugly buildings might good in the short-term ( aka cheapest initial investment ) , i believe that in the long term it greatly affects the community . 
  i do n't know how many would like to visit [ such places ] ( http://www.jeder-qm-du.de/uploads/tx_platte/xmy-belgrad-1-15-36-41.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dh0dogk.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gozlacx.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/928137/images/o-scampia-facebook.jpg ) or [ bloody this ] ( http://www.drogaonline.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/apartment-blocks-in-romania.jpg ) . 
  but i have a very strong feeling that not many people would like to visit those cities . 
  is n't he the guy who wanted money from tobacco companies in exchange for writing pro-smoking articles ? 
  no , no , no , absolutely bull . 
  cheap housing does n't have to be ugly . 
  pst . 
  it 's a pun , belgium abbreviated is `` be '' . 
  thank you !, 
  i googled it myself and found [ this translation ] ( http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.fi/newblog/archives/301 ) in which there seems to be a difference , after the mother finds that her son has murdered his brother she no longer calls him `` my happy/merry son '' but `` my wretched son '' , is that the original version of the poem ? 
  also do you know where i can get the actual lyrics of the song that you linked ? 
  what i found on google seem to be all over the place when it comes to the actual words . 
  thanks both to you and / u/iconopony for velisurmaaja , i 've been playing it on repeat for the last half an hour . 
  i love both . 
  no , my issue is not with his political views , but with how he attacks his opponents . 
  in fact , i 'd be completely up for watching him discuss political matters or events . 
  no matter how much i would like or dislike his `` opponents '' , he does have a shitty way to go about it and he regularly misrepresents their views , strawmans the fuck outta it and then attacks that flawed version of them . 
  for example , if i were to do something similar , i would : quote a chunk of your comment :  which is the same thing your supposed ideological opponents in sargons fanbase seem to want judging by the youtube comment section . 
  and then find and quote another chunk from sargon 's `` fanbase ''  i might disagree with thunderf00t but i do n't want him to stop making video responses on political matters . 
  ( that 's second quote is made up , ofc , i ai n't gon na search that shit ) and with that i 'd have `` refuted '' your argument , hur hur , i win . 
  there 's so many things wrong with thunderf00t , do n't even get me started , but recently he did renounce the `` skeptic community '' and withdrew himself from it , suffering quite some backlash from his user-base , which while it might still have a common share with sargon of akkunt , maybe in the future he 'll float away further - although at this point , ca n't say i care that much considering his indigenous way of portraying people . 
  his science stuff is good tho , he should stick to that . 
  shit yeah !, 
  i thought i made that obvious by painting that side as some retard who got his panties in a bunch and on top of that completely misinterpreted shit . 
  and it 's not just that , *** especially *** when it comes to media , to people who actually make money from the attention , no matter their political color , they are forced by the circumstances to write ape-shit crazy , attention-whorring fear-mongering emotionally-manipulating articles , otherwise they do n't get clicks , no clicks -  no money . 
  here it is : https://www.scribd.com/document/355792947/10-1016-j-worlddev-2017-07-017, 
  ugh , muricans and their political bullshit . 
  i saw it happen and it happens the same way every single fucking time : - someone says shit ; - some retard gets their panties in a bunch over it , completely misinterpreting the words ; - the kekistanis , alt-rights , conservatives , republicans and whatever the fuck kick up a big storm , because that 's their thing `` hurr durr my political corectness and freezz peachesss , the left iz ebil help help guns freedom moossslims murica we r oppressed ! '', 
  why does it have the exact same pattern , every single fucking time .

   last year two americans were surprised on the roof of salamanca cathedral sawing ball sized stones off . 
  what the fuck . 
  who the hell does that . 
  did they get a hefty fine at least ? 
  ca n't say i do , but not because of any animosity towards `` feeling european '' , but because i feel my country and subsequently my people needs to do much more work before i can equate them to what , in my mind , feels like what `` european '' is - a sort of mix of standards - living , cultural , nature-protecting and political quality standards . 
  we have improved , sure , i do n't deny that , and there are things that i take pride in , but it does n't feel like we 're there yet . 
  that being said , i do wish both eu countries as well as the eu itself would build an `` european '' identity or feel , something to blanket over our cultural identities , to empower our different cultures and further unite us . 
   the most likely answer is to have no tariffs on food and get it shipped from the commonwealth/eu . 
  that 'll fuck up british farmers like nobody 's business . 
  while i understand where you 're coming from , corruption will find a way no matter what , because that 's the nature of corruption itself . 
  however , i do n't think we should downplay just how important these kind of laws are , while no law will ever make corruption impossible , it sure as hell will make it harder to take place . 
  generally they 're a step in the right direction . 
  is n't that the guy who renounced the white-supremacy kkk bullshit ? 
  not like just a simple `` dun like em anymo '' rhetoric , but literally after renouncing his affiliation with the kkk in1947 , he committed himself to racial justice and civil rights , so much so that the naacp praised him left and right ? 
  is that how you 're going to try and brandish the opposition as extremist/racist ?

  while your attention is focused on a specific , small chunk of time , you completely fail to look at the big picture and notice that indeed racism , sexism , homophobia and other idiotic shit has been greatly diminished over the decades and it did n't happen just by ignoring it , no . 
  i did n't happen due to people like you , who praise inaction , it happened thanks to people who fought back .

   first , i do n't think the trees attacked by the beetle have particularly high commercial value . 
  ecologic activists seem to directly contradict you on that one , arguing that these actions are done precisely for money :  using the outbreak of the spruce bark beetle as an excuse , intensive logging has begun in pristine parts of the forest . 
  in the first four months of 2017 , over 10 thousand trees have been cut down in parts of the forest with the oldest being trees over a 100 years old . 
   they say state forests is cutting the dead trees because it needs the money . 
  the institution is required to be financially self-sufficient , and nearly 90 percent of its revenue -- 7 billion polish zloty ( close to $ 2 billion ) in 2015 -- comes from selling wood . 
   the forest district office said it did not keep records of dead trees removed , but mr. bielecki , one of the district managers , called the accusations `` deeply unfair . '' how convenient . 
  and furthermore , lookie here :  the recently imposed legal ban on entering major parts of the forest serves to prevent citizen control of the intensified logging . 
  the government is banning people from entering parts of the forest ? 
  that 's always something that an innocent party does . 
   second , poland already has plenty commercial forests , so there would be no need for logging this particular forest for money , even in its man-planted part ... of course there would n't no need for logging this forest , unless you count *** more *** money from logged wood . 
  but that ca n't be a thing because they have plenty of forests and it 's not like foresters have been demanding more wood , naaah . 
  that did n't happen either . 
   poland 's environment minister , jan szyszko , an avid hunter and former forester , recently told parliament that unesco had `` illegally '' listed the bialowieza forest as a world heritage site in 2014 and asked prosecutors to investigate the designation . 
  uhuh , sure , jan. . and since the matter of those beetles is propagated so much by the governing rightists here 's this snippet from unesco 's 2016 report http://i.imgur.com/oxn9npa.png - seems like the forest magically survived the previous beetle infestations . 
  it must 've been god 's will . 
  but not this time tho , this time szyszko managed to get a hold of yahweh and he totes told him that it 's `` for real , dog '' . 
   it is key to understand , that only the part under strict protection has seen very little human activity . 
  all other parts have been impacted by human activity which stretches from at least 18th century until 1990s . 
  seems that this exact narrative has been pushed by jan szyszko , the polish minister of environment and was contradicted by robert cyglicki , the polish greenpeace director . 
  bogdan jaroszewicz , the director of the bialowieza geobotanique station said `` i 'm not saying that the bialowieza forest is virgin or pristine or something like that , we do n't know if it 's natural 10 , 50 or 70 percent , but it 's the best that we have ''  wwf hosts an extensive archive dedicated to the issue . 
  indeed it does . 
  in fact , i took a look at wwf 's report on balowieza forest from one year ago and there 's a very interesting thing that jumped right at me :  the interpretation of various concepts such as `` sanitary cutting '' and `` safety reasons '' : there is a lack of definition of those concepts which is detrimental to the understanding of what forest management measures , compatible with the preservation of the ouv , can be taken in order to preserve the key features of the forest in the long-term and to ensure the safety of the visitors ; mhmm . 
  quelle surprise . 
   bark beetle outbreaks should be considered as a biological process , in the sense of the world heritage convention . 
  while most likely influenced by a range of external elements , such as climate change and recurrent droughts , such events represent a biological response of cyclical nature widely referenced in the literature this seems to be agreed upon by scientists and ecologists : as little intervention as possible , let nature and the forest take care of itself ; however that does not seem to be the case from your minister of environment 's point of view nor the foresters . 
   this type of tree has high commercial value in comparison with other types what a coincidence . 
  i 'm sure no polish politicians has any personal or monetary interest in this aspect .
