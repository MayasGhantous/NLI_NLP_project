  if merkel can see an election benefit in opening the gamescom event , she also implicitly recognizes the benefits of that particular event/market , and that 's a plus to her as a politician figure . 
  what she chooses to side with is important and speaks about her ( or her team 's ) beliefs , because if she had participated at a climate denial event , that could have been similarly construed as a `` election stunt '' as well , but it would 've said an entirely different thing about her . 
  the people and things she associates herself with is important and should not be overlooked . 
  we have lots of words of turkish origin , words like belea , fudul , \u0219ah , taraf , tutun , du\u0219man , caimac !, 
  that city is the area where most of our romanian of turkish origin are , at the eastern side of the country , close to the black sea . 
  years ago , my godmother used to go to turkey to buy gold and sell it back home , and she always came back with huge bags of sweets from you guys !, 
  i love it when fascist-lovers play the victim . 
  so that 's where we get our romanian `` sictir '' !, 
  thanks , til !, 
  yep , i think it is . 
  we might have some who deny it , like any other place , but overwhelmingly i think people know . 
  i mean , even if you visit the country side - in fact , especially if you go there , old people will tell you that shit 's not right . 
  so *** that 's *** what the title of [ emir kusturica/goran bregovi\u0107 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3mfufoulyi ) meant !, 
  * dang , i 've listened to that soundtrack countless times but never searched what it meant . 
   the uk is going to go through a long guilt trip in the next 4 years . 
  unfortunately , i am of he belief that it will last longer than that . 
  i should have heeded your warning . 
  how is he obsessed ? 
  unless literally hundreds of thousands of brits run to other countries , they will absolutely never equate it to an exodus . 
  ( which will never happen unless we 're talking a nuclear attack or a similar apocalyptic catastrophe ), 
  [ / r/europe for the next years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axtqesgjjgm ), 
  ah , yes , you 're absolutely right . 
  that 's far more likely !, 
  it was his wish . 
  also , you 're a bit of a cunt , are n't you ? 
  flight of the valkyries is a great song , but i feel that it is too animated and it lacks the gravity needed for a funeral . 
  it 's a meme , sort of . 
  `` beginner '' atheists go through an initial stage where they hate anything that has `` holy names '' in it . 
  that 's not how you split europa in syllables . 
  it 's e-u - *** ro *** - pa, 
  earlier i 've come across this interview https://streamable.com/bzfbe, 
  that was kinda my point , they needed to be specifically branded as `` class enemies '' , similar to how our former communist dictator branded anyone who disagreed with his views , dared critique him or protest against him as `` crazy '' , he even built psychiatric hospitals to send them to ( more akin to prisons ) . 
  maybe i 'm not able to explain my thoughts well enough , but what i 'm trying to get at : you can hold `` marxist '' views without the need of oppression of a societal group , while not so much for nazist views . 
  and furthermore , in the context of the article linked here , you can have nazis that go and terrorize society , which is not desirable . 
  is it made of petals/leaves or whole flowers ? 
  how big is it and how does it take ? 
  is it a valid comparison , though ? 
  from my point of view you 're deliberately omitting that in one case the genocide is embedded in the philosophy of said extremist group while in the other case there 's no such thing , and please correct me if i 'm wrong , i might as well be ignorant . 
  so , in the case of the mass murders caused by marxists it was n't due specifically due to the dogma , i mean you can be a marxist without wishing ill on any group , while in the case of nazis , you 're pretty much expected to have particular views that entail wishing/doing ill to particular societal groups ( jews , gays , non-aryan people , people with disabilities , etc. ), 
  that being said , i wholeheartedly agree that denial of such mass-murders should n't be permitted and should be reprimanded , but i do n't find the two comparable . 
  you 're *** free *** do to as you please . 
   i 'd rather not . 
  my comments are already at -4 -7 within one hour of posting . 
  and i did n't even offended anyone , i suppose . 
  this sub is very intolerant to different opinions . 
  users downvote usually because they disagree with your stance . 
  but , if you want to hide behind the `` i might get downvoted and internet points are really important to me '' rhetoric as a means to get yourself out of exposing your views and have them judged , then so be it . 
  but stop with the victimization , it really does n't suit you . 
  let 's see if that happens ? 
  tell us why !, 
  or alternatively message it to me and i 'll post it myself . 
   and 2000 years ago gay butt-fucking was pretty kosher in the civilised world . 
  not that fucking bullshit again . 
  no it fucking was n't . 
  what the hell are you even talking about ? 
  do you get your historical info from internet memes , mate ? 
  copying / u/baldutere 's comment because i agree with what he said and he explained it better than i ever could . 
  ______________________ even a confidence and supply agreement is too close . 
  a british government reliant on the support of the dup for their majority is in the same position as one in a formal coalition with the dup with regard to negotiations in northern ireland . 
  sinn fein and the sdlp already do n't believe that the british government under may acts as a neutral facilitator for negotiations , not without reason , and if the government is propped up by the dup then they simply ca n't claim to be an honest , neutral broker . 
  so the tories relying on the dup , even just with confidence and supply , vindicates everything that sinn fein have said about british rule in northern ireland for decades - that the british are n't honest brokers , that they ca n't be trusted , that they will always side with unionists , that there is nothing in the union for irish republicans and nationalists , that there 's nothing in the union even for soft unionists who reject the dup 's corruption and conservatism , that the only option to represent the interests of most people in ni is a united ireland . 
  this is very bad news for power sharing . 
  talks in the past have succeeded because nationalists have accepted that the british government has no interest in northern ireland beyond respecting the right of its people to self-determination . 
  this was certainly the case under blair , and i think under the coalition too . 
  this principle is the foundation of the good friday agreement . 
  if the government ends up in a partisan position where they owe their position in the commons to the dup then that will undermine the confidence of nationalists in the process and make it much less likely that negotiations will be successful . 
  and let 's not forget that the negotiations are scheduled to end at the end of june - just in time for loyalist marching season , traditionally the most tense time of year in northern ireland . 
  everyone involved needs to tread very carefully , but may 's government seems to lack any understanding of northern ireland and has in the past shown itself willing to be played by the dup so i do n't for a second believe that they will be at all careful . 
  so it 's a disaster for power sharing , but sinn fein will be loving it . 
  i imagine gerry adams is rubbing his hands with glee . 
  theresa may is handing them a huge win because she does n't understand northern ireland . 
   every action performed by our leaders get scrutinized and picked apart yeah , in some parts of the world that does n't happen - or at the very least it does n't happen the at the same level . 
  out of pure curiosity , which country are you from ? 
  well , at first it 's because of the peculiar way you wrote the reply and it 's also because i went in your history and came across [ this image here ] ( http://imgvr.ga/f2qq58 ) that you posted . 
   laughable and obviously untrue yeah , i get what you 're saying mate , i comprehend your point , but you would be surprised to see just how many people swallow that `` obviously true '' propaganda . 
  putin manufactured news where he went scuba-diving at a well-known locations and came back up with not one , but two greek artifacts , and plenty of russians bought it !, 
   how can anyone with a brain not see through that ? 
  yeah , i know , but poe 's law , my dude !, 
   well ... you are living in free country . 
  i did n't know , that to express your own opinion can be so hard . 
  mate , is this a joke ? 
  are you pulling my leg ? 
  is this a meme/prank or what-ever ? 
  the way you wrote that sentence sounds very russian-like . 
  are you actually a russian regularly posting on t_d ? 
  which country are you from ? 
   yes , and you are wrong , this post is anti - russian propaganda . 
  russia makes an ass of themselves and tries to use bullshit justification for invading ukraine and makes an idiotic show with kids that only backfires . 
  the show was intended to be russian propaganda but they are so retarded that it is easily turned around . 
  that 's a very peculiar way to put it , but ... well , yeah ... in that case any propaganda that is identified as propaganda is anti-propaganda , since it does the opposite of what its meant to do . 
  however , i am not wrong , you can twist and turn your words however you please that does not change the facts . 
  i thought you genuinely argued that this was n't propaganda that was initially manufactured by russians to further propagate the `` them bad , russia good '' narrative . 
  how is it anti-russia propaganda when ukraine is meant to be the `` bad guys '' ? 
   if you want to talk about politics . 
  nah , i 'd rather eat a bag of rusty nails and fuck myself with a 5 foot cactus , mate . 
   girl in the center represents `` revolution '' - when you kill your own . 
  girl on left represents nato and she wants to be ally with girl in center . 
  girl on the right thought , that girl in center is her best friend and thinks that she betrayed . 
  girls in background represents eu . 
  they promised to invite girl to live together ... but then ditch her .
