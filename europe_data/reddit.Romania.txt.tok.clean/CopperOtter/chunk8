  lol , no . 
  center is ukraine who [ moments before this shot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taxkgtoxdue ) was taken `` attacked '' usa and russia and then proceeded to kill herself . 
  from my point of view the `` purpose '' of this is to hammer down the idea that ukraine is unilaterally at fault here , that ukraine is the aggressor and they attacked russia . 
  here 's the original video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taxkgtoxdue, 
  ahahahahaha , wait wait , fuck , lol . 
  a regular t_d user posts russian fucking propaganda on / r/europe ?? 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  that 's interesting !, 
  do you know more info about that ? 
  what was the reason of the war ? 
  pardon , i was arguing against the reasons you got the downvotes and how you proceeded to edit the comment and come off as upset yourself . 
  that 's just ridiculous considering that you know that `` most people around here are clearly pro-eu which do not support brexit '' . 
  could be that people simply disagreed with your points ? 
  could it be that people downvoted on behalf of their dislike for peter hitchens ? 
  why are you so emotional about it ? 
   but it is naturally eurosceptic cut the crap , mate . 
  there 's nothing `` natural '' about uk 's eurosceptism , it is not only propped up but inflated by propagandist british `` media '' and their lies , if that 's natural then botox and penis pumps are natural as well . 
   look how upset you folks get when that point is even mentioned . 
  i didnt claim anything was good or bad i didnt call anyone out and yet you feel compelled to deny the claim like its poison , fuck you . 
  mmmmm , that 's a lot of projecting you have there . 
  why do you think that the people downvoting you were upset ? 
   i 'm truggered that triggered me . 
  where are the anglos !?!, 
   now that would be pretty hard to one up . 
  hmmm , how about no impeachment , but instead you get 4 years of a president with an obvious mental illness ? 
  his only widely praised actions so far ( domestically and internationally ) have been missiles launched at syria and bombs dropped in afghanistan . 
  it wo n't take long until he learns that his only route to praise without criticism is stirring up military action . 
  with 3 and 1/2 years to go , he could definitely come up with grounds to invade iran , north korea , etc. 
  we no longer live in a world where the apocalyptic could never happen , so it 's very possible a confrontation in the east china sea or something could spin out of his control because he 's so arrogant and incompetent . 
  oh yeah , you 're right on that part and it 's not what i actually meant , excuse my poor choice of word . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the states will not only continue their attacks in the middle east , but escalate it to a new level . 
  iran will most likely be destabilized and new military attacks will be made on whatever grounds they come up with , any aggressive action that comes from nk , no matter how small , will have a high chance to be met with another invasion/war . 
  when i said `` well if they do not do anything downright idiotic , like an act of war or something equally stupid '' i meant an act of war on a country that they ca n't justify just as easily as they would the ones in middle east or nk . 
  otherwise proper propaganda can explain away any attacks they do in iran or other such countries . 
  i mean , look , the number of drone strikes has *** quadrupled *** under trump , the same drone strikes that obama was barraged for , and no one really bats an eye . 
   i think the most likely case is that his spectacular failure will lead to a renewed push for a strong democratic system worldwide , but there is a very real chance that we are facing the twilight of the postwar system of wealthy powerful democracies integrating and liberalizing the world and into a system of european democracies squabbling internally while the rest of the world descends into illiberal states a la putin 's russia . 
  eh , while i get what you 're saying , that 's a too-pessimistic of a view for me . 
  i find it more likely that left-progressive ideas to be further propagated , if you look at the bigger picture the world as a whole continues to move towards that , sure it 's not a direct path , but a trend . 
  well if they do not do anything downright idiotic , like an act of war or something equally stupid , i do n't think their international image will suffer *** that *** much - sure , it gets papercut after papercut worth of damage and death by a thousand papercuts is a possibility , but that takes time . 
  to me it feels that there 's no more space for american politics to move to the `` right '' ( from an european point of view , this would be the `` extreme right '' ) without heavy damage to the republicans , but a shitload of space to move to the left . 
  however , you know , never say never and all that , shit can still happen . 
  eh , we will see , i guess !, 
  from my point of view , even though i know it hurts the us in the short term , in the long term someone like trump is good for them specifically because he 's so bad , the more he fucks shit up the bigger the blow back will be and the faster the states will recuperate . 
  sure , that 's pure speculation , but it might work . 
  i hope that everything trump wants gets approved - climate cuts , education cuts , healthcare `` reform '' , tax cuts on the rich , extra-inflated military attack budget ( not really a `` defense '' budget , let 's be honest , usa is not really defending itself from any attack ) , religious bullshit laws or whatever the fuck . 
  the fucking wall too , especially that bottomless money-eating pit of a `` project '' . 
  at least if you wan na fuck up , fuck up big time , learn your lesson and move the fuck on . 
  yup , i have zero hopes for labour to pull a coalition , just like i had zero hopes for labour to do any good in the election , i actually expected a landslide tory victory . 
  literally anything that happens is a pleasant surprise and drama-rich , as expected from the lovely brits . 
  [ mommie dearest really fucked shit up big time .

   smidir\u00edn\u00ed you guys need to bring gaeilge back , it 's such a wonderful language . 
   a bit like what the tories did with their majority . 
  i 've been laughing at last night memes ever since i woke up . 
  brits are so good at media-drama . 
  i 'll be laughing the rest of the year if labour manages to make a coalition with the rest of them . 
   smithereens is basically english non-formal for small pieces/ribbons/shreds . 
  that makes sense !, 
  thank you , til !, 
   but the questing * remains , how is america going to one up us on this ? 
  hmmm , would a constitutional crisis or a impeachment scandal work ? 
  or perhaps there 's gon na be another huge leak that blows everything to smithereens . 
  * ^ ( talking of which , what the fuck are `` smithereens '' ? 
  i know what the expression means , but i just realized i never knew what that particular word means or where it comes from ) *, 
  shhh , do n't anger the germans , you know how they get when they 're [ angry ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mzdghnm.png ) . 
  the polls have been all over the place in the past few days , it 's crazy , lol . 
  anyway , my default position is a tory win , basically same ol' same ol ( relatively ) , no disappointment involved , life goes on . 
   remember , it 's a series of electoral regions voting rather than a popular vote . 
  yep , i have to keep reminding myself of that from time to time . 
  however , i think the recent labour gains , however small , could be construed as a positive for britain - a stronger opposition does well to keep the ones in power in check ( something that we currently lack , for example ), 
  considering relatively recent political events , my default position on this is `` may will win '' , that way i ca n't get disappointed and any other result is a pleasant surprise !, 
  i 've seen brits taking a similar position as well . 
  * ^ ( after you 've been burned by hot soup you blow in your yogurt . 
  yes , that 's what i meant - for those crimes . 
  however , that right to trial , kinda goes out the window when you 're on the battlefield , and i think that it 's in france 's interest to kill its enemies , in this case french officials using iraqi soldiers to kill isis soldiers . 
  playing dumb , i see . 
  but you do it so well , that i 'm actually believing you . 
  were n't you guys spazzing out that you were leaving reddit ? 
  what happened ? 
  why did you came crying back ? 
  absolutely fucking not . 
  they have chosen themselves to be an active part of isis , to be part of that war and you want to let them go about , do their killings and catch them when they come back , if they come back ? 
  are you off your meds , mate ? 
  it 's not like they go into another country and steal , rape , or hell , even murder someone , and then you would , like anyone else , reasonably expect them to have a trial , these treasonous cunts are hunted down while they are part of isis . 
  and rightfully so . 
  a *** whole hour ? 
  *** * you poor , unfortunate , tormented soul . 
  you disgust me . 
  also itt : some brits defending their corrupt scum . 
  * hillarious . 
   you can point to them misleading the public `` misleading '' ? 
  mate , that shit ai n't `` misleading '' , it 's an outright conspiracy , staging an entire criminal operation . 
  they were lucky that they were brits , otherwise diicot would 've thrown them in jail . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that 's not the only time this criminal cunts have gone and outright lied about shit . 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'd rather read biased shit than outright manufactured fake shit . 
   but there are far stricter rules on televised news so it is difficult for them to be really biased . 
  except for the bit where they paid some of our romanians to act like gun smugglers , giving them a script and instructions how to dress and shit , staging an entire fake report . 
  but hey !, 
  beside that , i 'm sure it is difficult for them to be really biased given them far stricter rules you 've been talking about . 
  do n't forget sky news .
