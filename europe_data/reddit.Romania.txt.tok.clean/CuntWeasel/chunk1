this . 
  it 's funny how all of southern/eastern romania knows how bad the romanians from transylvania and banat had it , and how they were the liberators . 
  funny enough , i have yet to meet a banatian or transylvanian that can remember any of their grandparents/great grandparents complaining about how god darn awful it used to be , and how delightfully hunky-dory things became for them after ww1 . 
   i think that we should n't be represented by someone who does n't even have a romanian name . 
  not sure if you 're trolling or not , but if romanians pick their candidates based on how romanian their name sounds and not their political programme and/or level of corruption , then they deserve to be the shithole of europe . 
  i 've been living in canada for many years now , and tipping is expected here . 
  however even though it 's expected it does n't mean that the service will be up to par . 
  to answer your question - overall i 've gotten much better service from flat-wage waiters in europe than from tipped waiters in north america . 
  accepting reality and not making up excuses would be a good first step . 
  but in all honesty i 'm not sure if there is a solution for a country where psd still leads in the elections , where the likes of gigi becali have been role-models for years , where sub-culture trumps every other form of culture , where not doing any work and getting money is something that makes you cool , not an idiot that holds back the company/economy , etc. 
  there are many great people either living there or coming from there , but unfortunately they are the minority - the majority still has nothing better to do than listen blindly to the orthodox church , make sure gays have no rights , make sure no woman ever becomes president , shit in outhouses , and all that stuff that people in more civilized parts of the world were doing 50 years ago ( though shitting in outhouses was probably more like 200 years ago ) . 
  you can only blame politicians for so long until you realize it 's the average joe 's mentality that causes the gap . 
  once that changes maybe things will begin to change for the better as well . 
  you know what ? 
  they really are 200 years apart . 
  i grew up in transylvania and have spent the last 20 years living abroad . 
  a lot romanians do n't realize this humongous gap really exists . 
  it 's probably a pride thing which causes them to start comparing the historical centre of sibiu or cluj with some forgotten village located in bumfuck nowhere in france and go `` see , that village in france is shittier than romania '' . 
  which might be true , but that might be the shittiest place in france and you 're comparing it with the most touristy place in romania - it 's not a valid comparison . 
  i remember when i was on a bus travelling to romania with some belgians a few years back and when we entered the country i cracked the joke about them having to turn their watches 50 years back . 
  the bus driver , a proud romanian ( who up until then pretended to not understand any french ) threw a hissy fit about how the country is only shitty because of people like me who are putting it down . 
  sure mr. bus driver , that 's exactly why it 's shitty , not because of romanians not accepting reality and then fixing it . 
  read through some of the comments in this thread and you 'll see that the denial is strong with many . 
  france did n't deport anyone . 
  they ** paid ** a bunch of gypsies to go back . 
  for canada this would be a lot easier for obvious reasons . 
  overstayed the x amount of months you 're allowed to stay / made a bogus refugee claim ? 
  deported and banned from entering the country x amount of years . 
  and really they could just not accept any refugee applications from any european country and that would be that . 
  they are both part of the eu . 
  they are not part of schengen or the eurozone yet . 
  that being said , eu \u2260 schengen . 
  being part of the eu gives you certain rights though - like vetoing stuff like this . 
  they could definitely leverage this opportunity to their advantage . 
  however looking back at how they handled other things in the past , missing opportunity after opportunity just for their corrupt politicians ' personal gains , i doubt they will . 
  danovia  carpathia  rumelia like in the good old times when vienna was still our capital . 
  i 'm surprised they still have n't found a way to get rid of that [ superglue ] ( http://i.imgur.com/klfpmmo.jpg ) . 
  it 's not only the nationality that 's the problem - they compare a group of men to a group of children ( which usually implies families ) - and living next to a group of men from any country would be kinda weird . 
  another thing that i 've noticed is that the interviewer was using the term `` romanian '' while farage tried to turn it around and used `` roma '' for a while . 
  truth be told , i would n't like to live next to a group of roma no matter their citizenship either , but the fact that farage uses the terms romanian and roma interchangeably shows just how much of a hypocrite he actually is . 
  it 's funny because with small exceptions it actually looks a lot like a [ map of belligerents during wwi ] ( http://www.the-map-as-history.com/images/maps/tome6/ecran_1.gif ) ( sorry for the small image ) . 
   i 've been listening to them i assume you 're aware it 's a cover . 
  very good pick for a song that sounds good without understanding the lyrics , but i think [ the original by cargo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6zl0mzjhas ) is many many times better . 
  the voice of cargo 's old vocalist is so powerful it gives me goosebumps and radosav 's violin is fantastic . 
  while the song you linked to is a good cover , it hardly does the original any justice in my opinion . 
  according to [ one of the reviews in english on goodreads ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/778267.p_durea_sp_nzura_ilor ) the last time it was published in english was in 1967 so it might not be the easiest to find . 
  if you do however find it , please scan it and turn it into a pdf , i 'd love to read it in english as well . 
  for an international reader i think i 'd much rather recommend liviu rebreanu 's ** forest of the hanged ** , a fantastically written war novel about the psychological drama of a romanian officer in the austro-hungarian army that is sent to fight on the eastern front against romania . 
  it 's brilliant , and i 'd dare to say on par with remarque 's or hemingway 's works . 
  remarque has some fantastic books . 
  i read all his works and would also recommend arc de triomphe and die nacht von lissabon . 
  actually i think i 'd recommend all his novels except maybe der himmel kennt keine g\u00fcnstlinge . 
  * edit : spelling, 
   people are just living normal life so nothing to buy at the market but apples , having to wait in line to purchase food , a grand total of 3 car models , and a general state of disrepair of the streets and buildings is normal ? 
  i guess it was somewhat normal during those times since people kinda got used to it , but i still do n't get how so many people think of those times as good times . 
  not to mention the political system , the abuse , the lack of freedom , the [ securitate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/securitate ) ... 
  seeing these pictures i ca n't understand how so many [ romanians still think those times were good times ] ( http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/ ) . 
  it 's not just here , and i suppose it depends on your circle of friends but all my social media accounts are flooded with * fuck this shit , romania , its people and its politicians can go suck a dick * comments . 
  ca n't really say i blame them . 
   overblown comments about a non-event . 
  true , but it does put into perspective how much romania is actually valued by its citizens . 
  not judging as i do n't particularly care about it myself , just observing . 
   the only common thing romanians really have is their language . 
  you are so incredibly right . 
  it 's actually a bit sad to realize that i 'd rather fight for another nation than for romania , but it does n't change the fact that it 's true . 
  there are plenty of occasions to desert , especially in the beginning when everything is still disorganized - the reason why many people do n't do it is because they do n't have their minds made up yet , second thoughts , fear , etc. 
  i ca n't speak for everybody here but i 'd rather take a bullet while trying to escape , than dying ** for ** romania . 
  either way in case of war romania is fucked - they 're really poorly trained ( or the ones who did n't get conscripted not trained at all ) and russia is a force to be reckoned with . 
  the thought of a court-martial might have an effect if you 're just scared of fighting and dying on the front . 
  when the reason for deserting is n't fear but rather disgust for the country you 're supposed to be fighting for then things change a bit . 
  you 've probably read * forest of the hanged * in high school - the guy did n't want to fight against romanians and deserted . 
  i think romania changed quite a bit over the past 100 years , so i would n't want to fight for romania and would desert without any remorse . 
   he was thinking about how to bring them back in case of war good luck with that . 
  i think a lot of romanians , whether living abroad or not , realized that their country is n't worth fighting for . 
  everybody is blaming the politicians , and i do too , but i 'd also add that it 's not worth dying for the people who constantly elect the same type of politicians over and over again , for the people who regret the fall of communism , for the people with a constant schadenfreude complex , for the people who drill holes in their walls at 8am every saturday or the ones who blast low quality music at maximum volume all the time , for the people who would n't appreciate your death anyway . 
  think of rebreanu 's [ forest of the hanged ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_of_the_hanged_%28novel%29 ) - that would be me should i get drafted , but naturally going the opposite direction . 
  i 'm probably more french than those french americans and the first time i 've been to france was 2011 and as far as i know have zero french ancestry . 
  yet i grew up with asterix , pif , louis de funes , les visiteurs , antoine de saint-exupery , and studied french for six years in school . 
  i obviously do n't consider myself french just because asterix is my favourite comic , but i 'd probably have more stuff to relate to because of the exposure to french culture . 
  so i think we can agree that it 's not the ancestry that counts but the culture . 
  ** edit : ** also rahan , how could i forget rahan ? 
  i agree that if you speak the language and your parents lived a polish lifestyle ( traditions , cuisine , etc. ), 
  that could make you polish as well as american . 
  however , assuming that you have polish friends , do all of them speak polish fluently ? 
  because from my experience most immigrant or first generation kids either speak a very broken mother tongue or not at all . 
  and then they ca n't really claim heritage in my opinion . 
  funny enough it seems that the worse the parents speak english the less the kids speak the old language - it 's almost as if the parents feel that since they could n't properly learn english they will have to speak to the kids in broken english instead of whatever language they came from , so that the kids do n't become social outcasts for not speaking proper english . 
  i have yet to meet an immigrant kid that does n't speak fluent english though . 
   it 's impossible for americans to claim nationality and be nationalistic on the level that europeans take for granted nationalists are everywhere , but say what you will - the average european is by far not as nationalistic as the average american . 
  we already know what nationalism leads to and most of us realize it 's all propaganda so we tend to avoid it . 
  i * kinda * understand the pledge of allegiance and all that stuff - they 're trying to make kids that come from different backgrounds and different cultures identify with us culture and leave their families ' culture behind , because after all they are american and should feel american . 
  that stuff is n't needed in europe , where in most countries the ethnic majorities usually make up at least 80 % of the population and the culture is more or less homogeneous . 
  i believe that what makes a country be its own entity is its culture , history and maybe language . 
  therefore i 'm not even sure if people born in say poland but raised in canada should claim that they 're polish . 
  technically they are , they might even have a polish passport , and even culturally they might be a bit polish but definitely not as much as they are canadian . 
  the second generation in a new country though has very little to do with their grandparents ' culture and a lot of them wo n't even speak the language . 
  in my opinion it 's when you lose the language and do n't understand the culture that you ca n't claim the heritage anymore ( obviously it 's a bit trickier if the old and new country speak the same language ) . 
  where in the world does that little shit even find those commie outfits ? 
  i ca n't help but feel that i 've seen someone wearing [ very similar clothes ] ( http://old.qmagazine.ro/modules/articles/content/926/small/ceausescu-si-cainii.jpg ) before . 
  it 's always funny to see american expats ( and not only expats ) thinking they know what 's best for other countries just because what 's there does n't align with their view of the world .
