  the lady at 1:22 who did n't get anything ... ** reporter : ** what did you want to get ? 
  ** lady : ** at least something , i do n't know ... something !, 
   penis to penis rub \u0ca0_\u0ca0  in your childhood \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   i did touched a vagina though it does n't really count if it 's your own . 
  if it 's somebody else 's , chapeau . 
   currently in timisoara can confirm , grew up in timi\u0219oara , pretty much everyone i know in my age group ( let 's say 27-37 years old ) at least tried it , and about 1/3 of them smoke it on a regular basis . 
  judging by my cousin and her group of friends , usage seems to be even more prevalent with people in their early 20s . 
  i think it depends on where you smoke it - based on my personal experience the * often not enforced * scenario checks out . 
  also , in the entertainment districts of bigger cities it 's not uncommon to walk by groups of people and smell it . 
  that being said , i would not advise tourists to try and buy it themselves , as that 's definitely dangerous if you just buy it off the street ( the seller could be an undercover cop ) , but if you have a friend that can provide you with it i would n't worry about consumption . 
  never heard of it before either . 
  that 's why i was somewhat stunned to find out [ the word actually exists ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/neerlandez%c4%83 ) . 
  til * neerlandez * / * neerlandez\u0103 * is an actual word in my mother tongue . 
  * olandez * / * olandez\u0103 * is what people/tv/media usually call it . 
  it depends a lot on the people you meet and where you meet them too . 
  i generally have n't had many issues either , with some notable exceptions : 1 . 
  travelling in germany with some friends in 2005 . 
  3 guys and a girl in their early twenties in a small ( and new , i.e. 
  not run down ) car with romanian plates . 
  got stopped by cops three times for no other reason but the damn flag on the license plates . 
  they checked our papers and on our way we went . 
  it was a bit unnerving but hey , it is what it is . 
  oktoberfest 2007 . 
  in a small group of young people of both sexes , we sit down at a table with a couple . 
  we start chatting in german and they ask us about our accents . 
  as soon as we tell them where we 're from , their relaxed and happy look turns to a noticeably distressed one . 
  they did n't leave , nor did we , but there was no further communication between the two parties until we finished our beers and eventually went to another tent . 
  germany ( again ) , sorry germany - i moved there briefly for personal reasons in 2009 . 
  nearly impossible to get a phone plan with a romanian id - they were making up excuses left , right , and center and after a few days of frustration i tried my luck getting a phone plan with my canadian driver 's license . 
  since the name on the license and the rental agreement matched , they signed me up for the plan with a smile on their face in less than three minutes . 
  i really like germany and have a shitload of german friends , speak the language fluently since i was a kid , and have extensive knowledge of german culture , but in all honesty no other country has ever made me feel more like i do n't belong , not because of my own actions , but because of the actions of a select few that happen to have been born in the same geographical area as myself . 
  i personally have not had this issue in any other country . 
  and my axe !, 
   i 'm team #tea are you okay ? 
  are you sick ? 
  thanks for the explanation . 
   20 % is only the vat that 's true , but the vat ( if you 're a company and you charge it ) is not yours to begin with . 
  and if you pay it , then it 's not a percentage of your income , but rather a percentage of how much you spend . 
  however , i googled a bit and apparently the social contributions are 10.5 % + 5.5 % + 0.5 % , which with the 16 % income tax added , does indeed fall in the 30 % -40 % you mentioned . 
  i find the 10.5 % to be rather steep , not to mention that if you 're a sole proprietorship ( pfa ) , it can go up to 26.3 % . 
  if i misinterpreted any of the information please let me know . 
   programming  sadly about 30-40 % of what you make goes to paying taxes back in my day \u2122 , software developers were tax exempt in romania , is this not the case anymore ? 
  when i was working there ( about 12 years ago ) , all i had to pay were the contributions to unemployment , health , and pensions . 
  also , forgive my ignorance , but does n't romania have a flat tax rate of 16 % ? 
  do the contributions add up to more than the tax ? 
  both the town hall of sf\u00e2ntu gheorghe and the police car have the colours of the flags in the wrong order ( the police car technically has them in the right order , but not the same order as the writing , so i 'm not sure if that 's a mistake or not ) . 
  the sad part is that it was n't szeklers who did this , but romanians who do n't know the order of the colours on their flag ... 
  i 've seen this in many non-hungarian majority cities/counties too . 
  yes . 
  also , at least in the area where i 'm from , * groh * ( with a hard h ) is a lot more common . 
  goo it 's, 
  the voice is surprisingly similar . 
   yep , we also call them \u0219vabi that is not 100 % accurate . 
  the term * \u0219vab * is only used for a couple of subgroups of settlers of german ethnicity , namely the [ banat swabians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banat_swabians ) ( part of the danube swabians ) and the satu mare swabians , both of these groups arriving here much much later than the [ transylvanian saxons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons ) ( ro : * sa\u0219i * ) . 
  they look different than their transylvanian counterparts , dress differently , speak a different dialect of german , and are mainly catholic while the vast majority of transylvanian saxons are protestant . 
  additionally there are even more sub-groups of german speakers - albeit much smaller in numbers - such as the [ banater berglanddeutsche ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/banater_berglanddeutsche ) which in turn can be divided into multiple subgroups ( such as the * pemi * for instance ) . 
  these guys came to these lands even later , and are also never called * \u0219vabi * . 
  * that ship has sailed . 
  i know it 's a joke , but / r/canada is actually pretty good as a national subreddit . 
  / r/toronto on the other hand is complete utter cancer , it 's as if it was n't even part of canada . 
  me too . 
  10/10 good job op . 
  maybe he 'd like to stay in the same geographical location , in which case his life would change regardless of his citizenship . 
  it 's gon na be difficult to paint the 90s in romania in a good light . 
  people tend to forget how shitty it really was , because in comparison to the 80s it really was n't that bad . 
  on top of that , a lot of the posters here were kids so they naturally associate the 90s with the carelessness of childhood/teenagehood . 
  i tend to do it too , since on top of the carelessness i also had it relatively good living in a big city , but my parents were working multiple jobs just so that we could have it good . 
  however i also remember the generally rampant poverty , criminality , filth , cracked streets , run down buildings , homelessness , the stench of shit every time you crossed a bridge , etc. 
  i 'm not saying it 's impossible to paint it in a better light , but these are far from `` the most outrageous photos '' . 
  this was the reality back then . 
  i know people are generally selfish ( sometimes rightfully so ) , but if someone would care to inform them , they might understand this is the normal flow of things . 
  back in 2007 or 2008 a big nokia factory from germany closed down and moved production to romania . 
  naturally , there was drama . 
  i think the new factory functioned for three or four years , after which it closed down and nokia moved production again , this time to asia . 
  no matter what people think , companies are doing what they 're doing so that the shareholders can make a profit . 
  they will cut costs where they can and if moving every year maximizes profits , they will move every year . 
  if anything , it 's better for everyone if companies move from one eu country to another , instead of moving production outside the eu , for several reasons that are obvious if you 're at least a little bit informed . 
  politicians like le pen do nothing but take advantage of people 's ignorance . 
   borsec can be bought in romania and sometimes hungary you can find it in canada in pretty much every deli as well as some of the chain grocery stores . 
  romanian wine on the other hand not so much , if at all . 
   yet i confirmed the religion is still the same as i as born with ( which is what they asked me ) . 
  my guess is this scenario would fall into the first category i was describing - they skew the results by conveniently * assuming * everyone who 's baptized into a religion is a believer . 
  i 've only been asked about my religion by the authorities when i briefly resided in germany , and the reason for that is that people of certain religions get to pay a church tax over there . 
  since as far as i know that 's not the case in romania , i 'm really curious why you were asked that question . 
  that being said if i 'll have to re-apply for an identity card and they ask me this , i 'll tell them i 'm a member of the church of the flying spaghetti monster just for shits and giggles . 
   that 's ridiculous . 
  i think it 's a bit more ridiculous to blindly believe in something without any proof of its existence whatsoever . 
  i think the percentage is still a bit skewed , for the following reasons : 1 . 
  the church is pretty influential in romania and they do n't want to lose the grip on power , therefore they tend to * influence * the results of these polls by making sure the right demographic is being polled . 
  a shitload of people are n't actually religious , but since they 've lived their entire lives in a religious society they tend to be cautious when it comes to religion . 
  in a way their religion is like superstition - they do n't really believe there 's something or someone out there , but they 'd rather not take any chances and upset the potential deity , so they 'll say they 're religious . 
  some people also are n't religious , but pretend to be for the sake of their family or traditions . 
  i would say probably 3/4 of my friends who had kids had them baptized . 
  most of them never showed any religious inclinations , so when i asked a couple of them why they had their kids baptized , one answered `` because my parents wanted it '' and the other one said `` for the afterparty '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , there are still way too many religious people in romania in my opinion , i just do n't think it 's 9 out of 10 . 
   i never understood why this association makes any sense at all . 
  [ vagina dentata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vagina_dentata ), 
  i guess it 's about stability , and generally buying real estate provides some sort of stability . 
  i 'm in my mid thirties , childless , relatively successful in my career , and have pretty much been in long term relationships all my adult life , so you could say my life is relatively stable in that regard . 
  while i could technically even afford buying a flat or a house in the suburbs , i feel that because of the high real estate prices i would become a prisoner of my workplace and would always be stressed about losing my job .
