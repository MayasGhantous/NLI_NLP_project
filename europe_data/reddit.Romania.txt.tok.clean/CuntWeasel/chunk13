  since i 'm not ready to put up with that stress i continue renting , and since i 'm renting i do n't feel my life is stable enough to have a kid . 
  by the looks of it i 'm not the only one that 's in this situation . 
   yes and no , depending on how you define the balkans . 
  if you define it based on behaviour , corruption , short temper , then yes , it definitely is . 
  just like how portugal is secretly eastern european . 
  unless it 's a joke that flew by me like in that star trek android gif - in leu / in lieu , then you 're right - a lot ( if not most ) prices in romania are expressed in euros , mostly because of the stability of the european currency . 
  tl ; dr - the government wants to legalize governmental corruption to save their own asses . 
   people do n't abandon bags of cash , so why would they abandon walking bags of cash ? 
  * cash cows * , my good man ... you missed the opportunity . 
  sorry mate , but this really does n't belong in this sub . 
  also , before/after pics would 've helped a lot . 
  they 'll try one way or another . 
  as / u/mihnea100 pointed out , for them it 's all or nothing . 
  i can see two scenarios : 1 . 
  they clench their teeth and go all in without any lubricant ( i.e. 
  they pass the amnesty bill in its current form , completely ignoring the protests ) . 
  this would be ideal , as people would get royally pissed and would most likely overthrow these pieces of shit once again . 
  i doubt the current government is that stupid , but they 've done idiotic things in the past so everything is possible . 
  they wait for a while , then pass a much more restrictive amnesty bill which would n't save all of them ( making examples of a disposable few ) , but the more important lot would still get pardoned . 
  i personally think this was their plan all along - it 's like bargaining in a way - get the people worked up about something absolutely outrageous , then bring another suggestion to the table that 's more acceptable and the people will likely accept it . 
  maybe so it would be easier for them to trespass on your property ? 
   this subreddit bounces from serious content to absolute shitposting . 
      i love it . 
  i love it too !, 
  it 's great to have a laugh every now and again . 
  i can still remember the horrible months when somebody decided to make dclauzel a mod here . 
  that man hated everything and everyone , especially humour . 
  glad this past year has been a lot more relaxed , and lo and behold the sub survived without going to shit . 
   actually , 1st from left is the only somewhat hittable from the whole set . 
  i 'm pretty sure you meant to say * from the right * . 
  different sources probably . 
  germany is n't the only one that 's spelled in multiple ways . 
  no , i agree with you regarding miss england . 
  she 's really pretty , but looks a bit weird due to the haircut . 
  slap a modern hairdo on that face and preferences will change . 
  you 'll notice most people in this thread ( naturally ) prefer the ones that have somewhat more contemporary hair , their faces mattering less . 
  oh please ... if that is n't just a really unflattering picture of kristen shaal , then i suggest visiting an optometrist . 
  agree with belgium , but i 'd substitute denmark for germany . 
  germany looks oddly masculine to me . 
   german everything except german internet the general public also seems to dislike german rules and code of conduct , without which romania will never come even close to germany in all other fields . 
   she 's more canadian than bulgarian . 
  random fact , my so went to school with her for a few years and grew up on the same street . 
  she knew that nina was into acting but had no idea how big she had become until she saw her on tv a few years ago . 
  now dobrev is the most googled person in bulgaria and has an alleged new worth of $ 6 million . 
  i think he probably called you a traitor because of the fact that you are vehemently pro-russia , while france technically still is an ally of the us at the moment . 
  just as a side note , i 'm not justifying the actions of the us in any way . 
  anyway , what 's happening in may ? 
  i see you trolls are n't even trying anymore . 
  your arguments have absolutely nothing to do with the original discussion . 
  that is if somebody was masochistic enough to actually read through your garbage this many levels deep . 
   because big part of jewish side of my family was burnt alive by romanian army in odessa . 
  it was long time ago and it 's over . 
  i 'd say if the romanian army would or could still pose a threat to your family 's or your personal safety , then yes , getting shivers when thinking about it would n't be as ridiculous as you make it out to be . 
   the whole existential fear romania has about russia is so so so blown out of proportion by romanian war hawks , that it 's getting ridiculous that might be so , but i honestly do n't know anyone who does n't get shivers when they think about russia , especially people from older generations who got to experience the actions of the red army first hand when they were `` liberated '' by it . 
  the point is that regardless whether or not the reasons are legit , romanians tend to not put their hopes and trust in other countries in case of war and are generally scared shitless of anything russian . 
   he remained in detention for ** five months ** despite there being an injunction stopping his removal . 
  personally i do n't care about the deportation part , nor do i really understand why some people still stay in a country whose majority clearly does n't want them there and whose media has been downright waging a hate indoctrination war on them . 
  however being detained for ** five months ** for something that most people get a slap on the wrist for is a bit unsettling . 
  if this is true and drinking in the park is the only thing the guy did , then it 's really fucked up and there should be interesting times ahead for both the uk and the eu . 
   we need to trust each other more . 
  i think a few more generations would have to pass ( or a war that proves them wrong starts ) until romanians really start believing other countries will stick to their promises in case of war . 
  my great grandparents were hoping for churchill not to serve their country to stalin on a silver platter , then my grandparents lived half their lives waiting for the americans to come liberate them from the soviets , and yet neither happened . 
  add to that that romania itself has a nice track record of betraying its allies , and you 'll understand why a lot of people are alarmed when this type of stuff happens , especially when it 's coming from the russians . 
   100 ~ ~ ps ~ ~ hp ftfy . 
  you 're wasting your time . 
  took a look at his posting history , most of it is aggressively pro-israel , and if you dare criticize the state or the atrocities it been committing you 're automatically an antisemite in his eyes . 
  if you ask palestinians they might agree . 
  you 're absolutely right - this is xenophobia at best , although most likely chauvinism . 
  i 'm not sure it would even count as racism towards the turks , let alone the bulgarians who individually could potentially be indistinguishable from the poles . 
  but i bet there will be people who will point out that the word racism has evolved over time and now encompasses all the aforementioned terms . 
   a lion wielding a scimitar ... making them one of the coolest countries if only real life worked like that . 
   a lion wielding a scimitar is pretty badass though , i must admit . 
  it 's actually an oil derrick , to point out the industrialization and riches of the glorious communist state . 
  i hate to be that guy , but the map is n't accurate . 
  here 's the [ romanian coat of arms ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ezk5rs.png ) . 
  i think a lot of it has to do with the authorities not giving a shit . 
  i 'm now temporarily residing in romania and my building 's recycling bin that services 10 apartments gets picked up twice a week , yet there are always additional bags of recyclables next to it pretty much all the time . 
  one bin just is n't enough for the amount of people in the building . 
  i 'm pleasantly surprised my neighbours actually sort their garbage properly , but if the authorities / recycling company do n't follow through with their part of the deal it 's all in vain anyway . 
  well technically he 's still an idiot - viktor orban is n't the president of hungary , he 's the pm . 
  but you ca n't guarantee the same government will still be in place or that swedish society will be the same by 2030 . 
  obama was n't trump either , but that does n't mean that trump is n't president now . 
  the fact of the matter is that if you get rid of cash you open a pandora 's box and make society even more reliant on both technology and the government , both of which can lead to tons of abuse . 
   they would be screwed too because if the state is freezing your accounts they 're probably going to seize your physical assets too . 
  if it gets to that you 're screwed either way . 
  what i mean is if it happens by accident or because you forgot to file your taxes on time . 
  i do n't think there 's a revenue agency in the world that would seize your physical assets for that right away , but they might lock your accounts . 
   netherlands etc , normal people use 100 % electronic money already . 
  the only people still using cash is criminals . 
  til some of my dutch friends are criminals . 
   i would force you to build your own roads . 
  that would be slavery . 
  but to your point , i would much rather only pay for what i 'm using - be it healthcare , tuition , roads , than have my income taxed and the money redistributed to services i might never use . 
  privately owned highways are usually a lot better than government-owned ones . 
  same goes for trains and healthcare . 
  either way , are you telling me that you go and declare the income you made from selling your used stuff that you have that holier-than-thou attitude with me ? 
  i think even the cra would laugh in my face if i did that . 
   oh , you assumen there is no money at all ? 
  well that 's what cashless means . 
  look , i know there are solutions to everything - of course you could borrow food , or just even ask somebody to drive you around , hell maybe you could even barter with people .
