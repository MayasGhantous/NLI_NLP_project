  when you choose to move to another country it 'd be nice to leave your old habits behind and accept the new culture . 
  this is valid all the same if you come from the us , pakistan , or any other place with a different culture . 
  in the summertime i jog about two to three times a week and occasionally rock climb . 
  in the wintertime i rock climb at a gym about twice a week . 
  it is however fairly common for me to not exercise at all from november to march and usually very little during the months of august and september . 
  i do n't smoke but have at least a beer or a couple of glasses of wine or whiskey a day . 
   it 's awfully close to saying `` europeans are more civilized than others '' i see how what i said could be interpreted as that , but that 's not what i meant and i apologize if i offended anyone . 
  however based on my own experiences my point still stands - this is the only subreddit where even when i had a different opinion than the majority i was able to discuss it freely without being downvoted because of the `` inconvenience '' i was causing by being of a different opinion . 
  me too . 
  i feel that europeans tend to be better at defending their point of view through arguments rather than ignorance . 
  i love europeans . 
  edit : i was n't being sarcastic . 
  anyone care to explain what was so wrong about my comment that i 'm getting downvoted ? 
  also known as `` the bearly red rocket flag '' . 
  it 's cool though , i hate it when people are so prudish they pretend genitals do n't exist . 
  still made me giggle . 
  i ca n't speak for russia ( i think they 're in a league of their own in many aspects ) , but in many other eastern european countries sex is a pretty taboo subject for the lower classes - it does happen , but they do n't talk about it to kids . 
  if you 're not being taught about sex when you 're growing up you do n't understand the implications . 
  ignorance leads to pregnancy , pregnancy sans money leads to abortions . 
  if there would be proper sex ed in school and at home the unplanned pregnancies would plummet and so would abortion rates . 
  the us and canada . 
  first time i ordered gyros and got these stale leather belts i thought they mixed up my order . 
  you can sometimes find real gyros as well but you need to know where to look . 
  kleftiko on the other hand i 've only had in greece . 
   kleftiko +1 on this . 
  it 's probably in the top 5 dishes i 've ever had . 
  unfortunately really hard to come by where i live , in a country where [ this disgrace ] ( http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2012/08/11/ca/71/nosh0604-1_610093a.jpg ) is being marketed as gyros . 
  could be , but having lived in canada for over a decade i beg to differ . 
  it might seem so at a first glance but when you get to the bottom of it even eu countries that might seem very different are actually culturally closer to each other than to canada - due to the geographical proximity , cuisine , history , education system , you name it . 
  the only place in canada that could potentially be considered more european than north american would be quebec . 
  i probably could at least pinpoint the area where it is ( which to be fair a lot of americans did for ukraine too , though an alarming number thought it was in central asia , not europe ) . 
  that being said i bet most europeans would not say burundi or the drc for example are in asia or south america , and at least they could tell continents apart . 
  it depends on where you come from - to me every single pizza i 've had in italy was absolutely fantastic . 
  then again i live in north america where random pies topped with plastic cheese and salami mislabeled as bell pepper are considered pizza , so ... 
  why is the child on page 6 of this european brochure being measured in imperial ? 
  such attention to detail . 
  a commenter on liveleak said [ this is the guy ] ( https://www.facebook.com/geo.jiatat ) . 
  in my opinion he 's a bit more tanned than your average mediterranean southern romanian . 
  thank you , thank you . 
  those were the times when you were actually able to make really good friends on the internet , the times of 14400 modems , * borrowed * university internet accounts , and many sleepless nights due to the fact that outgoing phone calls were 10 times cheaper after 10 pm . 
  good times . 
  the times of coad\u0103 de maimu\u021b\u0103 . 
  until the early 2000 pretty much everybody was calling it a monkey tail . 
  i 've been on the internet since 1995 and back then nobody called it `` arond '' - they started using that once tv and radio stations began having email addresses they had to give out to the viewers/listeners , and i guess monkey tail would 've been too hilarious to use . 
  that being said , one of my elderly neighbours was absolutely baffled for a while as to why all radio show hosts were jewish and had aaron as a middle name . 
   a common criticism is that soldiers would n't speak the same language as you said , they do n't need to and history confirms it . 
  i 'd also add that austria-hungary had troops that spoke german , hungarian , romanian , czech , polish , etc. 
  afaik only officers had to all know german , while also being able to lead their troops in their own language . 
  did you specify you 're canadian ? 
  while european discrimination against americans is not unheard of ( in certain places - like serbia - more commonplace than in others , due to more or less recent history ) i have never heard of discrimination against canadians . 
  not to find excuses for ** any ** discrimination , but if you ever get weird vibes or looks in europe because of your american accent , just casually specify that you 're canadian - i do n't think anybody hates canadians and i 've seen attitudes change on more than one occasion when people realize you 're not from the us . 
  100 % agree . 
  romania is already not doing too good economically speaking , with a gdp ppp of $ 16518 in 2012 , about 2.5 times less than germany 's and quite a bit smaller than greece 's or portugal 's . 
  now compare moldova to that - moldova had a whopping $ 3424 gdp ppp , which is almost 5 times less than romania 's and the lowest in europe . 
  romania is n't really in need of more clay , they already ca n't properly handle what they have . 
  if moldova joins , romania will become the poorest eu country ( and there will be quite a gap between them and bulgaria ) and the living standards will plummet . 
  also keep in mind that the moldovans you might have met are the cream of the crop , students , artists , intellectuals . 
  i would assume the lower classes would be at the level romania was in the early nineties - not something to look forward to . 
  i do n't believe that any self-respecting frenchman would even touch poutine . 
  you 're right , it really is that simple - please go and tell that to the families of the jews that had their property confiscated and sent on their way to the railroad station some 80 years ago . 
  that also was well within the bounds of * the law * and decided by the majority back then . 
  as far as i know they can get fined by the eu for not complying with * the law * , so it 's likely a calculated risk . 
  also , just because it 's * the law * does n't mean that it 's right or makes sense for everybody - not so long ago it was against * the law * to be a homosexual , and weed is still against * the law * in many places , although both were/are victimless `` crimes '' and they make no sense to the ones who broke/break them . 
  similarly , for the slovak government accepting the migrant quotas is something that does n't make sense - maybe , just maybe , they know their own people and economic strength better than brussels , and decided that migrant quotas are unacceptable , therefore breaking * the law * . 
  my beef was really with / u/zmsz 's choice of words - there 's but a fine line between ** comply ** and ** obey ** . 
   serbia was simply the spark that lit the fuse ... as can any small country , which renders your initial argument invalid . 
   then comply are you for real ? 
  politically i was never right-wing , i was always * somewhat * leftist ( not enough to ever vote for a socialist party though ) , but some of the comments i see here , hand in hand with the censorship that 's been going on lately makes me wonder if socialism is n't more of a plague than anything else . 
  no mate , you 're confusing it with [ bulgaria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw8dnstf3te ) . 
  * * did you hear about the crisis of refugees/migrants from the middle east trying to enter * ** romania *** ? 
  * nobody 's trying to enter romania irl , not even migrants . 
  he 's already on board . 
  the schengen area has ** nothing ** to do with legal immigrants . 
  schengen \u2260 eu , please make a mental note already . 
   your an idiot you 're, 
   i 'd probably shit my pants before bursting out laughing to be honest i had a hard time not laughing myself while saying that so they did n't take it as a threat but rather as the joke that it was . 
  that 's a bit too complex for my level of hungarian , but there are keywords that would let me know it 's swearing . 
  * and this one i once used in amsterdam when a bunch of your countrymen were being rowdy in the hostel : * bocsi szarik , menjetek aludni . 
  * they laughed and actually did keep it down afterwards . 
  i know enough hungarian and serbian to get me into trouble but not to get me out of it , i.e. 
  i only know how to curse , because that 's what my friends decided would be useful to teach me . 
  other than that i know some important keywords for travelling such as rend\u00f6rseg , k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m , hvala , jo napot , dobar dan . 
   also , quit giving romanian passports to moldavians . 
  i 've personally stopped doing that last year . 
  i realized what a big mistake it was , and since then not a single moldovan has gotten a passport from me . 
  i am indeed pro-eu . 
  i 've grown up in a multiethnic city and feel just as close culturally to hungarians and germans as to romanians from transylvania , and quite a bit more closer than to romanians from the eastern parts of the country . 
  on top of that i had never met a russian until i moved to canada , so of course i 'd like to stick with what i 'm familiar and comfortable with . 
   take romania and poland with you no thank you . 
  this is the corruption ** perceptions ** index . 
  * the corruption perceptions index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be . 
  of course it 's his opinion - that 's why it was him who wrote it and not somebody else . 
  i do n't have access to all the information you have as a mod , nor the time to go through the archive to build statistics unfortunately . 
  i 'm also not stating that the mod team as a whole is doing a bad job , you can actually have a civil conversation about most topics/decisions with the majority of mods . 
  but sometimes all it takes is one bad apple to spoil everything as was the case here . 
  i 've been subscribed to this subreddit roughly since i signed up for reddit some 3 years ago , and over the years there have been ups and downs , touchy subjects , etc. , and the idiotic comments have always been weeded out by the community - that 's why i really really liked it here . 
  one might argue that that 's not possible anymore due to the sheer number of subscribers these days , but abuse from the mod team also triggers a lot of those comments ( as well as spam accounts created by the ones who got banned just for posting from sources that did n't have the seal of approval ) , otherwise the subject would n't come up every other day . 
  i 've also seen some commenters be advised by some mods to leave this sub and head over to european if they do n't like it , for comments that were far from being extremist but still did n't overlap with some mods ' views ... and that 's pretty screwed up , since just because you see things differently does n't mean that you 're right-wing by any shot . 
  i feel like the quality of the comments in this sub has gone down lately , but to be honest i believe one of the things that greatly accelerated this process was the whole censorship and agenda pushing by some mods . 
  while the agenda pushing seems to have slowed down after the community repeatedly asked for it to stop , i think it 's a bit too late .
