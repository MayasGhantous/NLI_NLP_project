  is there something like a temporary refugee visa , or do they have to apply for an immigrant / permanent resident visa ( which then would explain the long wait ) ? 
   migrants , nor immigrated people i do actually differentiate between the two , maybe i should 've been more clear . 
  i 'm mostly curious about experiences with people that come to europe via turkey or the mediterranean as refugees from war torn and/or poverty-stricken countries in africa and asia . 
  i 'm happy to hear that criminality stays low . 
  it 's very similar in canada actually , especially for first generation immigrants . 
  they tend to stick to their own kind and although exceptions certainly do exist it 's usually only their kids that eventually properly integrate . 
  however i was wondering more about refugees and migrants that illegally enter your country via the lorries from calais . 
  thanks for the answer . 
  i 'll post the question as a new thread and hopefully it wo n't get delisted by our resident cretin . 
  edit : thanks for the information , i did n't know the m ** \u00e9 ** gatread did n't exist anymore . 
  goes to show how one moronic moderator can almost ruin a sub . 
  same here , never heard the phrase * `` she 's a 7 . 
  '' * when i was growing up . 
  we used to group them in three : attractive , mildly attractive , and unattractive . 
  i 'm not sure if the 10 scale has found its way to eastern europe yet , but the fact that they consider themselves an average 9.4 does n't mean they 're cocky , it just means that a. ), 
  they 're content with their body and b. ), 
  they do n't really understand how the scale works . 
  ... and it 's not finland you 're thinking of . 
  i think it would help , and i 'm pretty sure the eu has wasted/is wasting a lot of money on projects that benefit people less than this . 
  the only issue with this is that people would have to admit that english has indeed become the lingua franca and that does n't fly well with nationalists . 
  why not ? 
  how would it hurt to have access to paperwork in english in addition to the national language ( s ) ? 
  city subsidies probably . 
  it 's also not a particularly big zoo - although the last time i visited about 10 years ago , they had over 10 tigers . 
  yes , his name is [ phil tippettescu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ayl4vus.png ) . 
  it 's not us who need them , they 're for a friend . 
   i would classify romania as much safer than canada . 
  from my late teens until my mid twenties i 've drunkenly walked home thousands of times in the middle of the night ( 3-4 am ) on the streets and through the parks of timisoara , and i 've never had a single incident . 
  in montreal my friend and i nearly got mugged by a small gang - they came straight towards us and were violent , but thankfully my friend knew kung fu and the entire thing was over before it started . 
  in toronto i personally have n't had any problems so far , but i 've had not one , not two , but three close friends get mugged on relatively busy streets walking home in the evening ( not even late at night ) . 
  i 'm well aware that toronto and montreal are bigger than timisoara , and therefore crime might be more commonplace , but based on my personal experience i too would classify romania safer than canada . 
  i guess they 'll just have to stay in germany for a while , before heading over to calais . 
  alright we 'll keep the money . 
  the only problem is that the gypsies are headed your way anyway . 
  good luck using espa\u00f1ol in europe over english . 
  some people live in their own little magical worlds , where everybody ** really ** hates english . 
  it 's funny just a couple of weeks ago that stupid theme song got stuck in my head . 
  * ja das ist ein hut und der gef\u00e4llt uns gut * - i 'm in my thirties now and cringe when i think that i used to sing this shit when the show came on . 
  personally germany , but it might have something to do with the fact that i studied in a german school , pretty much exclusively watched german tv as a kid , know the culture , etc. 
  hell , after more than a decade of living in canada the majority of the friends i made here are german expats , rather than locals . 
  i 'm not sure it would be the same for the rest of my countrymen , although we do have an ethnic german president . 
  after germany i 'd say probably serbia and hungary would come second and third , due to the geographic proximity and minorities of the city i grew up in . 
  i thought i 'd be fairly good at this . 
  proved me very very wrong . 
  maybe a word that 's not so similar in slavic languages would work better for this game . 
  it was a joke , due to my username being so offensive to some . 
  man , you can at least try to remember my username ... 
  mods ? 
  ... and some of us are expats , and it 's only 23:04 over here . 
   i 'm european and i have no idea where kaliningrad is you 're a disgrace , now go to your room !, 
  yep , same here . 
  numbers seemed to be especially confusing for them - everybody thought my 1s were 7s , they did n't really know what my 4s were , and the 9s looked like g 's to them . 
  in the mean time i 've learned to write the american way so there 's no confusion anymore . 
  til that i write in a mix of modern and old cursive , as per [ this example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kqmbnmn.jpg ) . 
  my grandparents used to write their z 's in kurrentschrift and i always confused them with lowecase g 's . 
  it 's because it would be in bad taste to joke about jews as a former axis country . 
  therefore scotsmen . 
  my guess is that people would notice if you took alaska and pasted it to california 's forehad so that it sticks out like a sore thumb . 
   it 's amazing to me that i 'm even having this argument . 
  i 'm sorry to have irritated you mr master race . 
  surveys are biased . 
  take the same damn survey in germany , italy or finland and you 'll get very different results . 
  that may or may not be true - statistics can be biased . 
  i 'm not pulling the anecdotes out of my ass - over the years i 've owned or co-owned the following brands : honda , renault , suzuki , hyundai , bmw , ford , mercedes . 
  mercedes takes the cake no contest , followed by suzuki and bmw , with renault and ford at the bottom of the barrel . 
  i have gotten nothing out of renault and ford but frustration . 
  honda , the leading brand in the survey , while not a horrible car per se , was a money hog , as i had to take it for maintenance every 5000km to keep my warranty . 
  i kinda see your point , but most people build fences so passersby do n't stare at them as they go about their stuff in the yard , not to hide their garden sheds from view ... right ? 
  it appears that the cars i owned did n't get the memo - my real-life experience is very different from this study . 
  when i read the original headline i was rather surprised . 
  now i 'm not surprised anymore and for some reason it all makes sense and adds up . 
   humor i see what you did there . 
  nice try , but it 's spelt * humour * . 
   camp of the saints  the story alternates between the french reaction to the mass immigration and the attitude of the immigrants . 
  they have no desire to assimilate into french culture but want the goods that are in short supply in their native india . 
  although the novel focuses on france , the rest of the west shares its fate . 
  ho-ly-shit . 
  and this book was published in 1973 ? 
  talk about foresight ... 
   i do n't need to go to russia to know its a shit hole unless you 've been there you do n't know , you just assume , therefore proving that you indeed are ignorant . 
  i 've never been to russia , but i 've heard that st. petersburg , kaliningrad , etc. 
  are beautiful . 
  am i gon na call it a fantastic country ? 
  hell no , but i also wo n't call it a shithole until i 've seen it with my own eyes . 
   the countries that smoke less are higher on the happiness index the happiness index is relative . 
  according to this index portugal is shit and canada is the 5th best place to live in the world . 
  having lived in canada for more than a decade , and having visited portugal repeatedly throughout my life , i can assure you that if the happiness index is directly correlated to how beautiful a country is or how good peoples ' lives are , the study is way , way off . 
  well , as jerry seinfeld stated , political correctness will destroy comedy . 
  i 'd argue that it already has . 
  people in america are so afraid of offending anyone that they 're willing to water down humour to the point where it 's not even funny anymore . 
  i really wonder how this will get solved eventually . 
  i mean sooner or later something 's gon na have to give . 
  it looks bleak and it does n't seem to be getting any better . 
  oh how i love it when north americans start judging places they 've never been to . 
  ignorance is bliss , eh ? 
  ask about another country , see how that miraculously does n't get delisted . 
  just do n't dare criticizing ( even as a question ) the motherland of a certain nationalist with way too much power for everyone 's good and a mindset stuck in the 19th century and you 'll be fine citizen . 
  that guy should really get the boot , he 's treating this sub like it 's his own backyard . 
   so are portugal , uk and ireland eastern europe too ? 
  as somebody nicely pointed at one point - eastern europe is a state of mind .
