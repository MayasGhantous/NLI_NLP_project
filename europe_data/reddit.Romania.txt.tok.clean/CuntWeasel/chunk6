  why do n't you tell us how much sweden loves gypsies ? 
  edit : i love it when critical comments get downvoted - no better proof of one 's hypocrisy . 
   an average u.s. citizen ... who also happens to be white , am i right ? 
  that 's true , but personally i would never trade my personal space/privacy/independence just to save money . 
  i 've moved out at 23 after i finished university , and i ca n't possibly imagine moving back in with my parents . 
  if i need to save money i just work more or spend less . 
   i generalize of course ... you do , but it is fairly true . 
  while i 've yet to meet somebody here who 's ashamed of their family , i have seen some weird behaviour in families , such as charging the kids rent as soon as they get a minimum wage summer job , or making them pay for their own education if they want to go to university . 
  although some parents might have more than enough money to cover these expenses , they still do it to make the kids be * financially responsible * . 
  unfortunately more often than not this does n't work as intended and backfires , leaving the kids in debt sometimes until they 're 40 . 
  different cultures , different ways of handling things . 
  it 's interesting that although one might think this is mainly related to income , there 's definitely also a cultural reason behind it . 
  i live in canada , and while anglo-canadians tend to move out ( or sometimes even get kicked out ) as soon as they get any crappy job , i know quite a few people that come from southern or eastern european families , that for some reason prefer to continue to live with their parents well into their thirties . 
  some of them work good jobs at corporations or banks , have girlfriends or boyfriends , yet still prefer to live with mommy and daddy . 
  it seems that the only way to get them out of their parents ' houses is for them to get married . 
  although our opinions regarding ttip differ quite a bit , i hope you 're okay mate . 
  get well soon . 
  ctrl-f savannajeff for shits and giggles . 
  what has this subreddit become ? 
  i 'm sorry to hear about your friend . 
  i guess men could be tied down and then stimulated to get an erection , just to feel guilty afterwards for feeling pleasure . 
  most of the comments here make good points and i stand corrected ( not that i was dismissing it , i just could n't imagine it ) . 
  no , i 'm a guy . 
  i live in canada where men tend to not be treated equally with regard to this . 
  i 've actually read on a canadian subreddit not so long ago , that if you call a rape helpline as a guy they just laugh at you and tell you you should enjoy it , so i 'm really happy to see that male rape victims can actually get help in sweden . 
  i also was n't criticising , i was just trying to understand how men could get raped by women . 
  some of these comments made very good points so i appreciate the replies . 
  if i were greek i 'd probably eat a lamb kleftiko , the tastiest food i 've ever had and also virtually impossible to find where i live . 
   standard way to summon savannajeff . 
  ... as pleasant of a presence as that other guy that can be summoned by mentioning specific words . 
  this is not to keep serbians out mate , they already have visa-free travel throughout europe . 
  it 's for the migrants that go through serbia to western europe , where they patiently wait around calais to jump on a lorry and get to the uk . 
   just look how many greek people go to the us , canada , ... for some categories it would n't change much - i.e. 
  engineers , economists , etc. 
  however it would be a lot more difficult for doctors and blue collar workers to either move there ( blue collar ) or work in their field ( medical workers ) , so my guess is a lot of them would n't leave in the first place . 
  well being proud of your language is one thing , and being proud to the point of becoming annoying is a whole different thing . 
  it 's basically a form of nationalism , and i personally dislike nationalism . 
  how dclauzel became a mod is beyond me , but then again crnaruka was a mod here for a while too if i 'm not mistaken . 
   even product variety is better in romania . 
  variety is what i miss most about europe . 
  the variety of dairy products in a toronto supermarket is comparable to a convenience store in romania - i do n't think people over here can even fathom being able to choose between 50 types of milk . 
  inb4 savannajeff begs to differ, 
  it 's not just cancers mate . 
  the food is mostly full of hormones , antibiotics and other crap , since the regulations are pretty lax . 
  while not everybody is dying of cancer , the people i met here generally do suffer from a lot more chronic conditions and allergies than their european counterparts . 
   american or canadian food stuff i ca n't enumerate because i have n't had any . 
  lucky . 
  living in canada i 'm paying roughly double the price of what the average canadian is paying for groceries to buy food imported from europe , and meat from nz ( have n't found european meat here ) - not only because most of the food grown in north america is full of hormones and pesticides , but also because it 's exceptionally bland . 
   how can people deny other people a happy life and equal rights ? 
  like a lot of other bad things , it mostly comes from ignorance and misinformation , which in turn leads to fear , since people tend to be afraid of change and the unknown . 
  add moderate religious fanaticism to the mix , and ta-da , you 've become a discriminatory prick . 
   well nothing wrong to showcase the success of a country that is developing rapidly and puts corrupt people in jail every week , right ? 
  i agree - however though i 'm originally from there and try to stay informed , i feel like there are way too many posts about stuff that happens in romania . 
  quite often there 's news about politicians i 've never heard of ( having been an expat for over a decade now ) , so i can only imagine how interesting those articles would be to a finn or belgian for example ( hint : not very ) . 
  we get it - many corrupt politicians end up in jail these days , which is good . 
  do we need to hear about every single small town mayor that gets arrested ? 
  probably not - that 's what the country 's subreddit is for . 
  i believe that the articles posted here should have at least a moderate impact on europe as a whole - i.e. 
  elections , trade deals , immigration , etc. 
  -- good enough ? 
  -- good enough . 
  -- time to call it a day . 
  pretty much how things get done over there . 
   and i am saying this is not always the case at all jesus h christ , with this amount of ignorance i 'm not even surprised the cops can do whatever they want . 
  you have the internet at your disposal , google some news articles and see how many cops get suspended ** with ** pay until the ** internal ** investigation comes to the conclusion that they should get away with just a warning . 
  no , it 's an ethnicity . 
  i know that for some cultures that have n't had too much contact with them so far being a gypsy is more of a lifestyle than anything else , but the eastern european gypsies are a distinct ethnic group , very much like pakistanis would be in the uk , thus pokymoonn 's comparison . 
  he 's just pointing out that citizenship and ethnicity are two different things and is giving you a taste of your own medicine . 
  they were stolen , but i 'm not sure who took them . 
  german president , story checks out . 
   it has to be a deep purple . 
  so what 's your stance on the bag ? 
   incredibly inefficient ,  canadians can confirm - i 'm a contractor so i 'm trying to get the job done and go home , but most full timers i see at the companies i 'm working with do exactly that - they come to work around 9 , dick around the office , go for coffee , have conversations , go for lunch , and then start working around 15 , being at work until 19 and then complain about how they work 10 hour days and getting paid shit . 
  of course there are also some people that really do work hard , but the majority of office workers hardly work . 
  france is the only place i 've asked for a lager and gotten strange looks from the waitress . 
  she then told me they do n't have that so i asked for a pilsner . 
  i shit you not she had to go ask the bar owner if they had that , and then the guy explained to her that lagers and pilsners are types of beer . 
  they do make a helluva wine though , so i guess it makes up for the lack of beer . 
   they are neither willing nor able to integrate into our superior culture of discussion . 
  while i did see your / s tag , there 's a lot of truth in your words - in no other subreddit have i had more civil and meaningful debates than in this one . 
  and even here , save for a few nationalistic douchebags , the vast majority of moronic comments come from * overseas * . 
  not really , i 've never heard anyone calling it `` pui '' . 
  you may be thinking about `` pasarica '' which means `` little bird '' and is less offensive , and mostly used to describe female genitalia . 
  it 's savannajeff mate , you 're wasting your breath . 
  this guy is so pro ttip that it seems that he 'd have some personal gain if this goes through . 
  well since we 're on the unpopular opinions thread , here 's mine : hungarians and romanians are a lot more similar than one might think , and the neighbourly hate is ridiculously stupid . 
  well they do have [ feral parakeets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scxlgxgpiqw&amp;feature=youtu.be ) already , so why not feral zebras ? 
  * `` some russians think that this is what toronto is like but most people know it 's ironic and that it 's russia . 
  it could all be tongue-in-cheek and the bbc just missed the / s tag . 
  then again it * is * russia , so you never know for sure . 
  can confirm , the roads in ontario have gotten progressively worse over the past few years . 
  i ca n't even tell the difference when i 'm going to quebec anymore , and i 'm assuming that in a few more years there wo n't even be any asphalt left on my street . 
  they 're definitely worse than belgian roads . 
   canada still receives more immigrants form europe than from china every year do you have a source for this ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious , since i 've been here 10 years and with only three exceptions that i can think of ( funny enough two of them were from france ) , all european immigrants that i met ( and meet ) have come here up until 2005-2006 . 
  there has been a spurt of irish nationals in 2011-2012 , but they were all here on work visas and have since returned to europe . 
  edit : downvoted for asking for a source . 
  what the fuck has this subreddit become ? 
  right , and at least in germany the 4-way stops are replaced with the [ priority to the right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/priority_to_the_right ) rule . 
  if you do n't have a stop sign on a side street it does n't mean you can just go fly through all intersections , unless you see [ one of these ] ( http://www.travel1000places.com/resv/img/info/strassenverkehrsordnung-german-vorfahrt--signs.gif ) .
