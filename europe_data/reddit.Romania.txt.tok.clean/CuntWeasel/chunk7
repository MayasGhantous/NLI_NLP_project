  if stick is preferred , then you 're probably also aware of the things i 'll point out below , but since i live in toronto and 90 % of people do n't know them and they can be a safety concern in europe , here goes : 1 . 
  never pass on the right . 
  use the passing lane for passing only . 
  nobody cares if you 're doing the speed limit , you 're not supposed to cruise in the passing lane . 
  familiarize yourself with the european road signs as they are quite different from north american ones . 
  make sure you know who has the right of way - this is also something that people completely and constantly disregard in toronto . 
  if you 're going up a hill and another car is coming down the same hill , but there 's only room for one , who has the right of way ? 
  did i mention never passing on the right ? 
  good luck and have fun in europe . 
  this . 
  not only are they exponentially more expensive in canada , but if you 're european and check prices online keep in mind that the sales tax is not included in the price , so add 12-15 % on top of that . 
  there are a few provinces/territories that have lower taxes ( 5 % ) , but the prices are usually a lot higher there due to their remote geographical locations . 
  it 's funny to see the reactions in this thread . 
  i 'm not judging , i 'm just saying it 's funny that what i see poles write here today , i saw romanians write about a month ago when there was talk about a possibility of mobilization . 
  my guess it 's because of how `` well '' the governments have treated the citizens , so that if shit hits the fan they 're like , yeah , take it , we 're outta here . 
  i 'm wondering if western europeans would also gtfo if attacked or if this is endemic to former soviet block countries . 
  i guess you have n't had `` hawaiian '' pineapple pizza ? 
  i 'll take ketchup over pineapple on a pizza any day . 
  that might be the case with newer banatians , but when i was growing up we had three serbian families , a hungarian family , and a czech family in my building . 
  the remaining five families were romanian . 
  i also ca n't think of anyone i know born in timisoara up until the '90s who has n't had friends from different ethnic groups . 
  here we go again ... du-te tu in pula mea , miticule !, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by that . 
  in my group of highschool friends i had all three aforementioned ethnic groups . 
  if anything i feel that a lot of wallachians resent hungarians , although they probably interact with one once every few years . 
  i 'm proud to be from the banat , and i have no problem with whatever insults you 're throwing at us - we 're used to it coming from you . 
  this is also part of the reason why i 'd much rather say i 'm banatian / transylvanian than romanian , and why people from this region get along far better with serbs , hungarians and germans than with romanians from wallachia . 
  the double taps in england . 
  at first i thought it was a peculiarity of the building i was staying in , but then i found out they are not at all uncommon . 
  i 'm not even kidding when i 'm saying i 'd probably go there just because of this video - it 's like taking a trip to the eighties . 
   there 's one for wallachia also , but i 'm not going to choose it over my country 's actual flag . 
  i do n't blame you , if i was from wallachia i 'd also prefer a different flag . 
  i 'm just sorry r/europe does n't have a banat flag ( well the devon one kinda looks like it , but i do n't want to cause confusion ) , so the transylvania one will have to do . 
  try harder , i have a hungarian girlfriend from romania in canada . 
  ( i 'm actually serious ) edit : i realise you probably had your girlfriend in canada too , so nevermind . 
  why stop at crimea ? 
  i 'd say it 's time to take alaska back too . 
  i 'm just glad it 's not [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fj0wsby.png ) . 
  yet . 
  it 's not that difficult really - you basically just write down nouns and adjectives , then eliminate all spaces and voil\u00e0 - you have a 50 letter long word . 
  or as i like to call it , a * fiftyletterlongword * . 
  i do n't think * everybody * hates serbia . 
  i personally quite like it and the people are pleasant so long you 're not kebap . 
  however canada is pretty much chinese operated thanks to harper . 
  not going to go into detail about the toronto housing market and chinese investments . 
   keep hatting on those romanians . 
  hey , at least they 'll get some free [ hats ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iu02q.jpg ) . 
  if we 're going by flags , i 'd much rather unite with andorra than moldova . 
  i do n't get how 36 % have a bath/shower in their house , but only 28 % have bathrooms ( i.e. 
  toilets ) . 
  why do n't they install a toilet as well ? 
  is it because of the pipe diameter ? 
  also , i bet you that 90 % of the people who have a shower but not a toilet use the shower for peeing , at least at night and in the wintertime . 
  in absolute numbers communism lead to a lot more deaths than nationalistic ideals . 
  add decades of misery caused by it on top of that and you will understand why people in europe consider communism worse . 
  you 're looking at the problem from your perspective , and it 's understandable since the nazis targeted your people - but although both ideologies led to much suffering , in the grand scheme of things communism was far worse , whether you like it or not . 
  * edit : downvote me all the hell you want , but numbers do n't lie and the downvote is the weapon of weak little shits who know they 're wrong but ca n't accept it . 
  * charles de gaulle 's german sounds a lot better than churchill 's french . 
  inb4 revise trianon . 
  i 'm not going to say that germans did n't rape anyone , but the stories i heard from my transylvanian grandparents and great grandparents is that the german soldiers were decent people , very disciplined , and did n't retaliate against the population even after romania 's government was overthrown and they became `` the enemy '' . 
  however when the russians came , they raped , pillaged and murdered their new `` allies '' like there was no tomorrow . 
  there simply was no way of negotiating with them , and therefore they were and still are considered by many romanians the scourge of the earth . 
  which might be why even today no political party in romania , be it left or right , expresses any sympathy or support for russia given the current events . 
  i personally have met decent russians , but as a whole in case of a conflict , i would probably consider them the most dangerous enemy to surrender to , immediately followed by americans . 
  only 10 % of germans speak german . 
  immigration is clearly getting out of hand . 
  * belgium : * they are stupid * * serbia : * they are stupid * * portugal : * they are stupid * * spain : * they are like the portuguese * nice twist . 
  also , iceland : * they are ponys * truth be told i 've never met anyone from iceland , so they might all be ponies for all i know . 
  shit man , sorry - i knew i must 've missed a couple . 
  * ireland - is specialized in animal husbandry * northern ireland - things to see in, 
  the uk was n/a . 
  that 's why i added gb , as it had a suggestion ( which incidentally overlapped with the one for england ) . 
  i 'm getting very different results from google.ro , through tor , via a romanian ip address ... my guess is these results are somewhat tailored to your user/ip . 
  just out of curiosity , can you please share how you searched for this ? 
  what language did you search in , how did you start your query , etc. 
  thanks ** edit ** - here are the results i 'm getting : * albania - why serbia-albania was interrupted * austria - worth visiting * belarus - n/a * belgium - a francophone country * bosnia - n/a * bulgaria - why pick bulgaria * croatia - worth visiting * czechia - n/a * czechoslovakia - was invaded * cyprus - what continent does it belong to * denmark - famous for * england - does n't adopt the euro * estonia - n/a * finland - n/a * france - the country of fashion and perfume * germany - the biggest importer of agricultural products * great britain - did n't adopt the euro * greece - is a tourist destination * hungary - n/a * iceland - what continent is it part of * italy - was the homeland of humanism * latvia - n/a * lithuania - n/a * luxembourg - has the biggest gdp * macedonia - n/a * malta - what country does it belong to * moldova - does n't unite with romania * netherlands - called the netherlands ( when looking for holland , the informal name in romanian - has two capitals ) * norway - not a eu member * poland - is n't a big grain producer * portugal - worth visiting * russia - left the war in 1917 * scotland - wants independence * serbia - was bombed by nato * slovakia - n/a * slovenia - n/a * spain - is a tourist destination * sweden - study here * switzerland - wants to stay neutral * turkey - is not part of the eu * ukraine - is at war * wales - called wales, 
  that 's roughly the price at metro . 
  pretty sure it does n't cater to tourists , but it 's the only grocery store in my area . 
  also , the prices in montreal are generally a lot more reasonable than in toronto . 
  having lived in canada for almost a decade and a half , i will have to agree with you , as harsh it may sound and unpopular it may be . 
   that 's around 6 dollars for 250 grams that 's roughly the same price you 'd pay at a grocery store in toronto . 
  possibly even less , depending on the brand . 
  while greece is indeed part of the schengen agreement , it still has borders since it does n't communicate geographically via land with any of the current schengen members , so i 'm not entirely sure what the point you 're trying to make is . 
  i would have to say [ heidi ] ( https://heidi-chocolate.com/ ) . 
  swiss owned , made in romania . 
  in my opinion it 's even better than lindt , it 's just that it 's sometimes it 's really hard to find where i live . 
  if it makes you feel any better , in my personal preferences , i 'd put hungary above russia , ukraine , turkey , israel , china , bulgaria , moldova , and the usa . 
  possibly also france , depending on whether the next frenchman i meet will be nice or a prick . 
  they 're big , relatively well trained , and not particularly smart or empathetic . 
  so yes , i 'd recommend avoiding clashes with the gendarmerie if possible . 
   ham & pineapple , stuffed crust , dominoes pizza i would much rather drink 20 liters of starbucks blonde roast than have one bite of the culinary abomination they call pineapple pizza . 
  i absolutely agree with you - the architecture , cuisine , culture altogether differs . 
  but physically i found the people to be very similar . 
   in portugal or spain you would notice oddly enough i find the portuguese to be the people that physically resemble romanians the most . 
   they are n't refugees , but they are economic migrants wait a second , i believe there was talk a few months ago that there was no significant number of economic migrants , only refugees from war torn countries . 
  are the people who caused the ruckus on new year 's eve all the economic migrants that entered europe or is the press contradicting itself ? 
   we never clink glasses of beer interesting , i did n't know that . 
  we never clink glasses with non-alcoholic beverages . 
  it 's okay for kids to do it , but once you grow up it 's considered bad luck to clink glasses with somebody who does n't have alcohol in their glass . 
  although i 'm not superstitious i still cringe every time i go out with canadians and they clink glasses of water .
