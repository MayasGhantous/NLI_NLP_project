  i do n't know what it 's like now , but when i was in school this was exactly how it was . 
  i was lucky enough to study in one of the best schools in my city and school was pretty serious . 
  high school was without a doubt the most demanding period of my life so far ( the most fun too ) . 
  then i went to university and it felt like a 5 year vacation with short bouts of studying during the exam sessions . 
  in university i also met a lot of people from other schools ( and from other cities ) , who had an extremely limited grasp of basic things such as writing correctly for instance . 
  it 's true it was a technical university so this may not be relevant , but a lot of my colleagues could n't carry a conversation about history , geography , or literature . 
  at all . 
  while some of these people were clearly intellectually impaired , a lot of them were actually really smart - just victims of a shitty education system . 
  [ you 're just skimming through the comments , are n't you ?

  incurable romantics obviously . 
  you wish .

  i agree with you that * asterix and the falling sky * was bad , so bad in fact that i decided to not add it to my collection ( i own every other volume ) . 
  but * asterix and the picts * was really not that bad , in my opinion it was the best one in 30 years . 
  obviously it does n't compare to the goscinny stories , but it 's not like we 're gon na see a new volume written by him anytime soon . 
  it 's human nature mate . 
  there were more passengers than terrorists on the 9/11 flights and they could 've easily overpowered them , yet nobody did anything . 
  there were more jews on the trains than guards at concentration camps , they could 've ( with some casualties ) disarmed the guards and taken over , yet nobody did anything . 
  if there 's even a slight chance of survival people will usually pick that over a slight chance of death . 
  even if there would 've been 500 migrants instead of 54 , they most likely would 've stopped in their tracks ( or ran away ) . 
   lightbulbs are not our biggest energy wasters this is very true , especially over here . 
  pretty much all houses are wooden with terrible insulation ( i 've seen windows with higher thermal efficiency in portugal than in canada ) , and pretty much all of them use electrical air heating which has pretty much zero thermal inertia and is highly inefficient . 
  in a country where -30 \u00b0 c is not uncommon during the winter months . 
  on top of that everybody cranks their a/c as soon as it 's 25 \u00b0 c outside and nobody buys a car with a sub 2500cc engine ... 
  but yet it appears that our greatest enemy is the incandescent light bulb although the statistics deny it - energy consumption : [ heating 63 % , lighting 4 % ] ( http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/products/categories/lighting/13730 ) . 
  mind you this is between 1990 and 2009 , before the incandescent light bulb ban came into effect . 
  i live in canada , where you can only buy incandescent light bulbs up to 60w ( until the current stock is depleted , since there 's a ban on 40w and up in effect ) . 
  i 've gone out of my way to find 100w and 150w bulbs in run down corner stores , and have stocked up on them . 
  i 'll buy into their save the planet bullshit when they come up with a decent alternative . 
   france was always the best at gastronomy hahahhaa . 
  hahaha . 
  no , really , france has a good cuisine , but it 's nowhere close to the italian one . 
  i do n't understand why so many romanians take the visa requirements personally . 
  i do n't know anyone who applied for a us visa and got turned down . 
  not a single person . 
  they all usually get 10 year visas , so it 's not like they have to go to the embassy every time they want to visit . 
  meanwhile the same visa requirements keep the scum out , which is why romania 's reputation is n't as tarnished across the pond . 
  if meme replies/reaction gifs would be allowed on / r/europe , you 'd get the star trek one with the android and the ball . 
   or putting clothes on when you answer the door to the milkman oh crap , that explains the weird looks ... what about the postman , is opening the door to the postman in the nude still acceptable ? 
  what if it 's a postwoman ? 
  that 's what happens when people get pushed around against their will . 
  it 's not brigading , it 's not people coming from other subreddits to manipulate , it 's just that the general opinion of europeans has shifted quite a bit over the past few months ... 
  personally i am ( still ) very pro-eu , i 'm neither for or against migrants , but although i have great respect for the german people , i am absolutely against the shit that germany has been pulling lately . 
   no effective control their are you sure you did n't mean to use * they 're * ? 
  i think it depends on where you are in canada and it ** greatly ** depends on the driver . 
  in toronto some drivers are so incredibly bad that i nearly got run over twice while crossing at a four way stop . 
  they were so stressed about driving , that they were looking right and looking left , and completely failed to look straight ahead and notice there 's somebody crossing the road right in front of their car . 
  i might be the only person from timisoara who got their license suspended for 60 days back in 2002 for failing to stop as somebody started crossing a four lane boulevard ( they were three lanes away from my lane ) . 
  but alas , i 've learned my lesson and ever since then i ** always ** yield to pedestrians . 
  bombs contain ferrous materials , they would be dismantled and sold as scrap before they hit the ground . 
   brain disorders leading to murder is most definitely a thing . 
  if it can be fixed through modern means then that should be an option . 
  would you be willing to take such a risk ? 
  the guy not only killed and beheaded his victim completely at random , but then also ate the guy 's eyes and part of his heart . 
  i 'm no psychiatrist , but that sounds beyond fixing . 
  while i would accept re-education as opposed to punishment as a solution for many convicts ( i.e. 
  people who snapped at somebody who provoked them , passion crimes , desperation , etc. 
  ) , i simply can not believe that somebody who kills people at random ( and in such a brutal way nonetheless ) and then cannibalizes them is ever going to be someone you can trust to walk the streets unsupervised ever again . 
  this is something i still ca n't understand , my mind refuses to accept that somebody would be idiotic enough to allow this obviously dangerous and deranged individual roam the streets , let alone unsupervised . 
  i remember when the story came on the news in 2008 i was thinking it 's something out of a horror movie , not reality . 
  fast forward a few years and they let the guy go on walks because ... he does n't pose a threat anymore apparently . 
  what the article you linked to does n't state but i consider to be of utmost importance , is that the guy not only stabbed his victim in the throat repeatedly and proceeded to behead him on a bus , but also ate his eyes and part of his heart . 
  how someone in their right mind would let that nutcase loose is beyond me . 
  it 's similar to letting hannibal lecter go on a walk , the only difference being that this guy is not a serial killer . 
  yet . 
  and a communist , do n't forget communism !, 
  dogshit maybe ? 
  not that difficult to find on big city sidewalks . 
  ... because the past 27 years have been lived in rampant capitalism without old communists running the place into the ground . 
  whatever you 're taking , i 'd like some . 
  i too need a break from reality . 
  i 'm currently in romania , planning a year-long trip . 
  wanted to keep my canadian 416 number , so i switched to prepay which turned out to be a bit of a clusterfuck to accomplish , and i ended up being on the phone with a fido rep for about two hours . 
  after about an hour she was like * `` you 're calling from abroad , this must be very expensive for you '' * . 
  i chuckled , and said * `` not really '' * because for 8 $ i got 20gb of 4g internet and 2000 international minutes on a prepaid card . 
   such a ~ ~ weirdly ~ ~ badly written article . 
  ftfy . 
  no real point , no conclusion , lots of pointless blabber . 
  1/10 would like my three minutes back . 
  `` fanny '' is strong ? 
  i know people who go by that name . 
  not only that , but over the years i 've heard considerably more jokes about albanians , gypsies , jews , and even somalis for a while , than about hungarians . 
  and as you pointed out , the hungarian jokes are all about local hungarians , not the ones from hungary . 
  a nato-russia meeting sounds pretty official to me . 
  now , maybe the map is about official state visits where he just visited those particular countries to talk to their leaders as opposed to going to an event that everybody attended . 
   endlessly removing news items for bizarre reasons all based on the mod 's whims i 'm not going to say they are n't , but what i can tell you is that i sometimes also see some varied/local content and i 'm happy with that , as that did n't use to be the case . 
  remember that a year ago we had that nut dclauzel as a mod , and he 'd remove literally everything he did n't understand/agree with , and in a very mature fashion he would respond to criticism with an idiotic * nop , nop * . 
  then there was this other guy whose name i ca n't remember , who was n't from europe and thus deleted every single submission ( including ones from reliable , verified sources ) that painted immigrants in a bad light . 
  those two almost ran this sub into the ground . 
  we got it pretty good now . 
  the map is wrong . 
  putin was in romania at the [ 2008 bucharest summit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_bucharest_summit ) . 
  inb4 mozart , strauss , franz joseph , sisi , franz ferdinand , niki lauda , schwarzenegger , conchita wurst , or literally anyone else . 
   we 'll send our `` dark '' legions first i 'm afraid the `` dark '' legions will come to canada regardless . 
  not sure if the agreement specifies whether or not canada can temporarily reinstate visas for romania , like they did for czechia after their `` dark '' legions launched an attack . 
  the average income in ontario is roughly 5x that of romania ( before tax ) . 
  to keep is simple , let 's not take additional factors such as poverty rates , general cost of living , or income tax into consideration . 
  9 $ x 5 = 45 $ , that 's about $ 65cad , which is pretty much what i 'm paying for a 20mbps down / 2mbps up connection , with the footnote that if i 'm uploading anything the download also goes down to 2mbps . 
  20mbps is roughly 50x slower than 1gbps .
