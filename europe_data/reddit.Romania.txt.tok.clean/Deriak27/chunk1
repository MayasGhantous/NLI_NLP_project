  david attenborough . 
  enough said . 
  i 'm sure they will put those ships to good use . 
  perhaps securing more oil sources ? 
  it would more appropriate for estonia or czech republic , but sweden is pretty close . 
  i think the map would serve its purpose better if it just kept the places where they are and then inflated/deflated them based on population . 
  i wish more media allowed for visible comments on their articles . 
  it really dumbs down their credibility to me when you ca n't see what other readers have to say at all . 
  i think he 's confusing freedom of speech with popular views . 
  you can go in sweden and say that being a housewife is preferable to having a job for women . 
  politically and in terms of relationships that view wo n't bring you much favour there . 
  shift to the east in russia and suddenly things are not so one-sided . 
  go to iran next and the debate will be pretty much nonexistent . 
  funnily enough japan is the most gender equal of all the countries in the graph . 
  it 's kinda sad too , considering their horrible demographic decline . 
  mainly because they have different sets of values for expression . 
  honyu for intimate situations and tatemae for formal and public situations . 
  they strongly believe in not disturbing the situation and keeping things calm and pleasant . 
  outwardly expressing views away from the norm is strongly frowned upon . 
  at least it 's better than other east asian countries that are way more authoritarian about it like china , thailand , vietnam , etc. 
  it 's okay , as long as everyone is equally poor !, 
  til i should claim gender dysphoria , have a sex-change surgery and move in the netherlands . 
  i see they added crimea to their repertoire too ( look at the shirt ) . 
  seems a little conflicting with the [ 2015 ef english proficiency index map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/2015-ef-epi-map.jpg ), 
  why ? 
  because they throw the keys in the river ? 
  what about sweden ? 
  not taking a stance to defend your beliefs ( human rights , specifically women here ) is disgraceful and shows no integrity . 
  but i guess that 's what diplomacy is in the end . 
  well , they ca n't all be right , but they can all be wrong . 
  personally i trust who with such statistics so i see jakob 's map as more reliable . 
  it 's just as bad as normal cigarettes if not worse . 
  it has the nicotine from tobacco plus all the coal smoke and the chemicals used in flavoring . 
  [ wikipedia has a good article about its health effects . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hookah#health_effects ) although you are right , it 's very difficult to smoke at a hookah like you smoke a daily pack but that does n't mean it 's not harmful or that it does n't create an addiction . 
  hope they make the return of the varangians an epic scene . 
  also no horns please . 
  but they have to compete with the arabs and iranians for the title of ultimate muslims !, 
  who will win ? 
  just an anecdote , but high school girls smoke quite a bit ; there 's actually quite a bit of a problem with that in our country . 
  not sure about college but i assume it 's not uncommon for youths to go the city center and puff away at a hookah in some turkish locale , or simply some classic cigarettes at a terrace . 
  what about alexei navalny and the progress party ? 
  i agree . 
  russia today is not pretty but i wish people did n't blow the situation out of proportion as if it 's some irremediable doom and gloom society . 
  the country has enormous potential and would really be an asset when it comes to important international cooperative matters , like global warning . 
  putin , despite being despised by many , is a pragmatic leader that actually [ improved the russian economy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/gdp_of_russia_since_1989.svg ) compared to his incompetent predecessor who failed to alleviate aftermath of the fall of the soviet union . 
  suicide you 're right about , [ as place 14 in 2012 is a pretty bad rate . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) life expectancy is [ around average globally according to who ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#list%20by%20the%20world%20health%20organization%20 ( 2015 ) , so not low , although the gender disparity is worrying . 
  [ alcoholism , you 're right again . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita ) [ violence not so much , although it 's up there . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) [ and as far inequality goes , if you apply it via gini index russia in 2012 is around where the us was in 2013 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ), 
  i am not so sure . 
  local leaders like ramzan kadyrov in chechnya are completely loyal to putin and are required to maintain a stable situation in touchy regions . 
  then again , maybe people like alexei navalny have a chance at it to modernize russia the next election . 
  they really ought to have another peter the great at this rate ... 
  by buying those reasonably priced burgers you support further research and the animal welfare you believe in . 
  i do n't think it 's too much too ask . 
  do n't get your hopes too high . 
  it 's 40 % for all people . 
  so that 's less than 20 % of the population being slim female , since obesity tends to be more prevalent among women than men so the 40 % is n't 20/20 . 
  and then from that ~ 20 % you have to extract the girls ( teenagers and women in their 20s , 30s ) who are probably less than a third . 
  so the math adds up and all i can say is ... good luck . 
  hopefully not america this time . 
  finns , poles , belarusians , bulgarians , serbs , turks , other baltics and us understand your pain . 
  seems more reasonable . 
  +50 % unemployment is absolutely absurd . 
  not even bosnia and herzegovina ( 35 % in 2014 ) nears that number , despite severe tensions and numerous conflicts in the area since the war . 
  [ cia world factbook ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html ) for example lists belarus as ** 0.7 % in 2014 ** , and it 's as independent as you can get with the addition of having a track record of accuracy and impartiality . 
  it actually makes much sense for an authoritarian left-leaning state . 
  whataboutism at work . 
  russia has a long history of conflict with the upper echelons of society , during any period really . 
  nothing new to me ; just pursuing their legacy, 
  is n't baltic basically nordic waiting list ? 
  appropriate perkele ? 
  denmark must be because of the bicycles . 
  same for netherlands . 
  norway skiing/hiking maybe ? 
  same for austria . 
  i am unsure of france and especially italy though . 
  i thought finland contained the testicles ? 
  well , i am not acquainted with the domain too well , but romania is only 1 country out of 23 on this map that is reported , as well as 1 out of the 50 + european countries on op 's map in his response to my suggestion . 
  hepatitis c is relatively widespread and dangerous , but not in modern countries that can provide treatment and prevention . 
  chronic infection can be treated easily with high success rates , plus the fact that chronic is the most common form of infection for the virus . 
  if anything , even if there is misrepresentation our rates probably do n't hit more than triple the represented rate , so 0.24 deaths per 100k . 
  adjusted to our population , that rate is 46 people every year . 
  * 46 people * out the 260k that died in 2015 . 
  i think a rate of deaths per capita would be useful to correlate with this data to help visualize the bigger picture . 
  by large of swaths you mean the nile , where the biggest and most important african civilization was built ? 
  currently it 's much more habitable due to our progress , but for much of our history conditions were not favorable . 
  unexplored parts of africa were not colonizable until the mid 19th century when technology and most importantly medicine gave our soldiers some resistance to local pathogens . 
  and yes , of course we exterminated or domesticated ( wolves -  dogs , boars -  pigs ) the dangerous wildlife , while in africa they did n't . 
  ever wondered why ? 
  no it 's not . 
  1/3 of the continent is covered by the sahara , its climate is mostly arid or tropical . 
  living in jungles or in the desert is not easy . 
  tropical diseases and parasites kept the population in check for thousands of years . 
  why do you think malaria is the deadliest pathogen in human history ? 
  billions died to it .
