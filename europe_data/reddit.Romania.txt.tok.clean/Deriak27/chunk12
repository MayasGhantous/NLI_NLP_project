  even russia allows street-view . 
  and yet at the same time germany still blocks access to large parts of its country via google earth . 
  so much for `` protecting citizen 's privacy '' . 
   `` why is siberia cold '' . 
  sigh that 's a good question i 've seen lots of adults fail to answer . 
  it 's a combination of : - closeness to the pole/northern latitude ( which means less sun , because the earth is tilted ) - wind patterns ( particularly the siberian anticyclone centered on baikal and arctic winds from the north which bring dry cold air ) - continental climate ( oceanic currents moderate the climate making summer cooler and winters warmer . 
  inland regions lack this feature , particularly if the geography facilitates this , see below ) - mountain ranges ( they block many currents that would otherwise moderate the climate ; in fact the coldest weather is experienced in the upper-right verkhoyansk range . 
  the deep valleys trap dense cold air that would otherwise rise up from heating during the day , a phenomenon known as thermal inversion . 
  as a turk you should probably know . 
  for many centuries , caucasian tribes like ossetians , circassians , abkhazians , etc fled to the ottoman domains to avoid russian hostilities like forced conversions , killings , etc. 
  asking the real questions . 
  i assume you 're speaking in jest , but i do agree with the second sentiment , however unrealistic it may be . 
  a democratic western-minded iran would be the second israel of the middle east . 
  what does the emblem on his right upper arm symbolize ? 
  he was clearly swamp german . 
  might be because of his age . 
  people forget this guy is 70 years old . 
  the only good thing is that i assume other orthodox nations are just as bad if not worse . 
  at least , i * assume * . 
  whoops , i did n't know that . 
  although i was referencing a comparison to a foreign presence in the region . 
  does n't memel count though ? 
  just curious , where was today 's geographical belarus in all of this ? 
  split between east slavic and baltic tribes ? 
  let 's take ops claim for granted then . 
  if the `` lithuanians today are made up of mostly dutch , german , polish and swedish settlers '' where is the evidence ? 
  where are the national records for such mass migrations ? 
  we know of the [ baltic germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) who formed the nobility of the baltic states for centuries , yet this is omitted ? 
  [ why are they speaking lithuanian instead of their local languages ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lithuania#languages ) where were the `` proto-lithuanians '' transported to ? 
  is there any genetic research into their lineage ? 
  was [ estonia ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=estonians&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjap8aw35duahvkbrqkhejqcg0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638 ) and [ latvia ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=latvians&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_wjvg35duahxjtbqkhdvdbz8q_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638 ) colonised as well ? 
  this just all seems like a retarded conspiracy theory . 
  even / r/the _ donald could do better . 
  to me it seems tszemix is trying to fulfill an agenda , claiming they are something that they are not . 
  this seems like a hoax . 
  [ `` since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside , so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanians#genetics ) based on \u010cesnys g. anthropological roots of the lithuanians . 
  science , arts and lithuania 1991 ; 1 : p. 4-10 . 
  i ca n't find the quotes in the video you posted . 
  at what time are they said ? 
  ordos-horde comes to mind . 
   genetically polish is closer to persian what ? 
  what would be some recent good news coming from russia ? 
  just being honest and curious , i do n't mean it in a confrontational or sarcastic way . 
  the true mark of orthodox christianity . 
  calling it something other than medicine makes it lose too much credibility though . 
   ah like china and the soviet union . 
  truly the pinnacle of humanist values . 
  or any other atheist state , like napoleonic france . 
  i do n't condone massacring clergy , demolishing places of worship or destroying history . 
  why do you think state atheism ca n't exist in comprise with humanism ? 
   and authoritarianism should stay in the 1930s as well . 
  why the strawman ? 
  see above . 
   by all means , speak out against superstition . 
  this is what state education is for . 
  i should n't have to convince people who have access to the internet and have finished high school that blasphemy is not an argument . 
   set up tables across the street from mosques were you point out the flaws of islam . 
  waste of time . 
  realistically you would n't have any progress . 
  also see above . 
  no educated person should live their life based on the ideology of a 7th century arab charlatan . 
   convince muslims that they are wrong . 
  what if they never were indoctrinated in the first place ? 
  again , this is something the state could fix . 
  promoting the religion is the opposite of fixing . 
   do n't prohibit their belief . 
  if i believe anyone who does n't follow my book deserves to die as well as suffer eternal damnation in an afterlife i do n't belong in anything remotely mimicking civilization . 
  yet if my belief has enough followers and time i suddenly get a free pass ? 
  no belief should be allowed to permit so many injustices and so much inhumanity . 
  i personally disagree . 
  implement heavy regulations on building places of worship , tax them more heavily , remove any state religion and so on . 
  all measures leaning towards state atheism would try to pull sweden out of the social mess they created in the last decades . 
  spiritual nonsense and superstition do n't belong in this century . 
  no humanist should tolerate religiousity over critical thinking and evidence . 
  in my opinion multiculturalism ( not just toleration , but promoting and mixing cultures ) fails the moment cultures actively contradict one another as well the two humanistic values mentioned above . 
  none . 
  stop building religious buildings ; they serve little purpose other than occupy the space they were built on . 
  an irreligious country like sweden should know better . 
  preferably do n't accept oil money from an intolerant slaver state like qatar to let them build it instead with their own personnel . 
  especially when you consider they have an ideological agenda behind those investments . 
  did the ottoman empire reform overnight ? 
  no , the language part is supposed to be triggering . 
  many romanians consider it a dialect of romanian . 
  the language-dialect barrier is often political ( eg . 
  arabic spoken from oman to egypt and morocco is considered one language ) and the moldavian identity is seen as a divide and conquer tactic implemented by soviets to integrate the republic , and after ussr for russia to maintain their influence ( transnistria ) . 
  i 've never heard of a moldavian telling romanians they speak the moldavian language . 
  although i did hear claims that their dialect is the purer , less corrupted form of our ancestral language ; paraphrasing ofc . 
  i guess debating which dialect lies closer with the development of a daco-roman language is a good way to start . 
   their language very similar to romanian this is how you trigger us . 
  japanese is not too bad either . 
  more information on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-european_migrations ) . 
  also a comment of the creator : `` the animated map gives an overall impression ; in the details , many things are not exactly right . 
  the first migration into the danube valley , for example , did not proceed from the yamna culture , which started almost a millennium later . 
  but altogether , the idea is to give an general impression of the migrations . '', 
  from what i read on the link , it appears he was simply a businessman involved in the war industry ( supplying weapons for the slavs ) until he found an opportunity to join a revolt and show off his military abilities . 
  in more modern terms he 'd probably be the equivalent of a miltary dictator . 
  his state also crumbled upon his death , which really shows how frail the authority was , even in comparison to other tribal states who had somewhat stable successions . 
  the name austria means eastern realm , probably because it was military borderlands during the [ frankish empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francia ) as well as [ east francia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_francia ) . 
  the dialect of german they speak is overwhelmingly bavarian , with some small allemanic dialects near the narrow border with switzerland in [ vorarlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vorarlberg ) .
