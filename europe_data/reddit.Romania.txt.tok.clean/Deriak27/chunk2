  not to mention all the dangerous and untameable wildlife . 
  there 's a reason why horses were domesticated in eurasia . 
  so flying a nazi flag is also legal ? 
  after all , it would be a double standard to inhibit people 's choice for extremism , would n't it ? 
  very true . 
  geography is destiny . 
  it just so happened to be . 
  africa was way too inhospitable for advanced civilizations to develop first , although cultures and interesting tribes did appear . 
  the nile , euphrates and tigris were a god-send for people tens of thousands of years ago when they reached the coastal area and crossed the sinai peninsula . 
  we are 70-75 % latin , 10-15 % slavic , some turkish , some greek , some hungarian , some germanic languages ( especially english neologisms for contemporary objects like pc , mouse , wireless , etc. ), 
  and so on . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_language#lexis ) i do n't know about hungarian [ other than what they say on wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_language#lexicon ) half of their vocabulary is non-european , although indo-european languages eventually shaped the other 50 % through areal influence . 
  slavic is the biggest it seems , more than us in fact . 
  why they ca n't just go to gdansk directly ? 
  it 's confirmation bias and by extension arbitrary . 
  your discourse leading up that paragraph seemed very much to suggest some sort of influence to the choice . 
  even if that is not the case , i do n't really find any value in it . 
  they are just common words meant to transmit basic ideas . 
  stop ascribing this sort of ad hoc significance to them . 
  the it by stephen king has come back with a vengeance , and is now after adult blood . 
  no , * you see * , they 're trying to justify that what they are doing is taking out the bad apples that might poison their supremacist ideology . 
  thus they ensure that no rationality penetrates their ivory tower . 
  interesting that you did n't respond to my second paragraph which offered a perfect analogy for your nitpicking . 
  because that 's what it is . 
  what you find fascinating is your own business , but i have a bone to pick with the fact that you consider the word choice as something relevant to a purely political choice , almost endorsing it as some sort of influence . 
  my point still stands . 
  it 's completely arbitrary and irrelevant ; nothing more than confirmation bias . 
  imagine tomorrow romania would have a vote to leave or remain in the eu , using the words `` par\u0103si '' and `` r\u0103m\u00e2ne '' respectively . 
  obviously the former is a representation of our orientation towards evil russia , and exploring our barbaric slavic roots . 
  the latter is the glorious latin heritage , the beautiful french language that modernized our country in the 19th-20th century . 
  reflect on those interesting parallels and contemplate how worthless they really are in the grand scheme of things . 
  [ their successors seemed pretty darn french though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angevin_empire ), 
   when the electoral commission approved the wording of the referendum question i was delighted . 
  `` leave '' is a good old anglo-saxon word , whereas `` remain '' is one of those new french words that the normans brought over . 
  one of those words would hit our hearts , the other one would n't . 
  so you 're to trying to justify brexit with arbitrary linguistic emotional claims ? 
  count me in too . 
  title seems misleading . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_recluse_spider ) : * despite co-occurrence with humans for millennia , there is only a single report of a human fatality linked to a bite from this species , a case report from 2016 in which no spider was captured for a confirmed identification , and in which the victim suffered from an autoimmune disorder ( myasthenia gravis ) . 
  [ 3 ] * the women in question was 65 years old , although the effects should not be ignored even in the case of a healthy person . 
  the bite is necrotic and can cause complications that are medically significant . 
  it 's okay . 
  i 'll take the downvote . 
  it 's not like satirical rhetoric is easy to spot on the internet . 
  says the swede who stays at ~ 2 meters apart from other people at the bus stop , frowns on small talk and is possibly [ among the loneliest people according to bbc ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56aiii/sweden_might_be_the_loneliest_country_for_expats/ ), 
   everyone !, 
  lets go back to antiquity !, 
  let 's go back to having 6 child families , less than half of today 's life expectancy and constant warfare ? 
  because rome ripped-off the greeks ? 
  they had much cultural exchange considering that hellenic culture was flourishing after alexander as the republic started to expand . 
  democracy , military tactics , philosophy and so on were very much influenced by the greeks . 
  it 's the very reason why the legacy is often called greeco-roman . 
  and yes , you 're right that the greeks were very successful despite the odds being stacked against them . 
  they probably never would . 
  there was , and still is , an arab minority in the last centuries , but the iranians have historically had much animosity towards the chosen people of allah . 
   the only other civilisation even comparable to them were the chinese , but even then most of that legacy came significantly after the greeks had essentially finished their absolutely remarkably run of achievements . 
  depends . 
  the egyptian civilization was also a great one , considering there is an entire branch dedicated to their study . 
  or the persians , who were arguably the greatest ancient civilization of the middle east and considered one of earliest , if not the first , [ empire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achaemenid_empire ) people like alexander the great owe much to them , since they laid the foundation for west-east contact . 
  the russian exclave has been awkward for decades now . 
  although there is a polish minority in belarus at the border ... hmm ... 
   eastern european  finnish flair were you under the iron curtain ? 
  be absorbed by poland and revive a glorious era from the past ? 
  i hate the two candidates dominance in politics in general . 
  makes it such a false dilemma . 
  3rd options are considered a waste of votes , especially when one of those two factions sometimes call you out on that . 
  wait , if this is so obvious then what possible argument do nay-sayers have ? 
  also , the 66 loss is after 15 years , so slightly editorialized title . 
  any commentary from russia 's dearest leader or did he stop caring about all the fun that 's been thrown at him through the years ? 
  man , i 'm so envious of your oceanic influence . 
  we typically get snowfall as early as middle november at times , typically late november . 
  it can get really darn cold at night , especially when you consider our communist buildings do n't have the most ideal of heating . 
  it 's around ~ 12 degrees in the capital atm , although we wo n't pass 16 this week according to the prognosis . 
  danish . 
  swedish . 
  generally the nordic group . 
  [ take a look for yourself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_phonology#sample ), 
   ireland signed away its sovereignty when it adopted the euro . 
  care to expand on that ? 
  if you think english is stupid with spelling , or phonology in general really , you should see other germanic languages . 
  you 'll want to thank the roman empire for latin influence . 
  there goes starting off smooth down the drain ... 
  how 's the weather there these days ? 
  i assume they emigrated to finland/norway or went to bigger cities in russia , like saint petersburg ? 
  would n't there be a public outcry if that occured ? 
  i never knew murmansk could be so populated . 
  you do n't see many lights in scandinavia to the west in comparison , at the same latitude obviously . 
  why is it so ? 
  is it just politics ? 
  economy ? 
  geography ? 
  culture ? 
  so then should you scrap it and adopt the eu customs ( they already have met some of the criteria you mentioned shared by many other countries ) or stay in the eea and mind your own business ? 
  the former seems silly to me considering you worked on it for half a century . 
  do n't you already have the nordic council ? 
  you could expand on that .
