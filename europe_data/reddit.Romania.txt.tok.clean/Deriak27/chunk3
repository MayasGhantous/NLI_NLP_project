  the uk did n't want them two centuries ago , but we 'll gladly welcome them back !, 
  kind of ironic considering the current british politics . 
  more like the uk , czech republic , etc. 
  [ after all sweden does n't mind having too many children of indian dalits !, 
  ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=59&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;button= ), 
  in the eu . 
  this century ? 
  mate ... did you drink a little too much ? 
  i hear danes really like their alcohol ... 
  this is from 2011 , so a lot of opinions , especially concerning immigration should 've changed . 
  also what 's the point of having maps with no data ? 
  you 're comparing britain then and now . 
  it had [ around 15 million people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_kingdom#history ) back then , so it was easier to feed all of them . 
  not to mention it was the first country to reap the benefits of the industrial revolution . 
  it was also an empire with lots of accumulated wealth from the places they ruled . 
  and most importantly , back then war was a viable solution to resolve any issue , not so much today . 
  so then what leverage * does * the uk have over eu ? 
  just honestly curious . 
  it ca n't be * that * one-sided , otherwise negotiations would n't be such a stalemate . 
  they might 've been drunk , jus ' sayin ' . 
  that 's the same mentality we had a century ago . 
  they are the barbarians and we must civilize them , continue the legacy that the romans left us , etc. 
  cue the white man 's burden by rudyard kipling , cue colonialism and so on . 
  all in the name of realpolitik , where pragmatism drives the actions of the country . 
  i agree with idea , but like i said i do not find it realistic , for reasons already stated . 
  it 's very hard to put it into reality and would most likely require more serious events to take place for people to consider it as a viable solution among the stuff that * works * , as in not ideologically or morally motivated but purely pragmatic , foremost in the interest of the state and then the rest . 
  even so , maybe realpolitik is n't what europe needs or wants . 
   what we * should * do is offer our services for government management . 
  neo-colonialism if you will . 
  take a country which sucks and where people are miserable . 
  and offer to the people , if they want , we 'll be willing to come in and take over their government , and actually set things right . 
  if they do n't want us to take over their country , that 's fine , that 's their decision , but they ca n't come here either . 
  the proposal sounds good in theory , but that 's a pretty big should . 
  it fails to take into account the conflict of interest that might arise when contemporaries rediscover what it 's like to have power over a poor , rather uneducated and populous country that is also quite rich in resources . 
  the cooperation required would be mind-blowing and if you ca n't convince citizens today to let a few european immigrants from poorer countries in the east then there 's no realistic way you could convince them to invest vast amounts of money and time in a 3rd world country the average citizen ca n't even find on the map . 
  then it 's op 's fault for ambiguity . 
  i assume most people think of * growth rate * when * growth * of something is mentioned . 
  absolute statistics need to be adjusted for context , or else they will be misinterpreted , intentionally or accidentally . 
  he also conveniently forgot to mention that the growth rate is decreasing , which is required for context and consequently makes it even more misleading . 
  fair enough . 
  i presume they would probably find some justification to propose such ideas anyway , but without religion and its popularity they would not threaten the average citizen who is just minding his own life . 
   compared to our moderate religions ... adapt to their standards or threaten the lives of the people [ umm ... 
  i mean it 's good news , but still ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55ziyo/polish_government_signals_uturn_on_total_abortion/ ) the us also has the bible belt and many downright atrocious fundamentalists that challenge the `` pagans '' , especially their muslim counterparts . . 
  the average person does n't care , and typically is caught in the middle . 
  the current pope is better but still not good . 
  you probably know about some of the controversial and downright ludicrous stuff he said since his investment . 
  the patriarchy in moscow in comparison is just sad . 
  do n't forget the romanians !, 
   he explicitly stressed that he thinks things could boil over long before muslims would become a majority in europe muslims , the problem is in the name itself . 
  i do n't care about their skin , or education , or anything else related to culture . 
  their religion however , is downright atrocious and belongs in the dark ages . 
  the catholic church grew a brain while the orthodox church was tamed by secularism and later communism , although there are still quite a few religious issues . 
  islam will most likely suffer a major reformation in the following decades , and there will be blood . 
  i feel that it 's our duty to , at the very least , make sure not too much european blood will be lost , including naturalized muslims who came here decades ago . 
  [ apparently some people ca n't even google simple statistics for well-known sites ] ( http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#growthrate ), 
  [ the russian federation is not doing too well either . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_russia ) almost 100 deaths in 2014-2015 alone . 
  the government banned 17 terrorist organizations , pretty much all of them related to islam . 
  granted , russia has a lot of enemies , but it 's still something to worry about . 
  and this is why it 's a good idea to invest in math and programming languages , whether you like them or not , especially if you 're young . 
  it can be something to fall back onto when times get rough . 
  that 's nice of them . 
  we are also a very religious country , more than poland in fact but orthodox instead . 
  different mentalities though , so i doubt we will have another abortion ban * cough * ceausescu * cough * , but we do have our fair share of religiously motivated issues . 
  at times i wish we had a theocracy and/or feudal system in the past so we could have had our own bohemian reformation and be a radical secular country like the czech republic . 
  we can play the no true german fallacy all you want . 
  there are different definitions of german based on ethnicity , migrant background , citizenship , nationality , etc. 
  [ wikipedia is a good start for understanding how they work out these matters . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#migrant_background ), 
  not the nazi/post-war germany reminder again ... 
  there 's plenty of stuff the average german can learn from their history . 
  the germanic tribes ? 
  the hre ? 
  the hanseatic league ? 
  the reformation ? 
  what do you think of donald trump ? ^ ^ smooth, 
  i wish iran was taken as an alternative . 
  at the very least they had some secular roots and show improvement despite the international pressure . 
  too bad it 's a shia country ; the religious conflict would get so ugly if the international community prioritized iran . 
  the dutch found their middle eastern soulmate . 
  nah , he 's right . 
  honest , dumb mistake . 
  this is common sense really , no need for economics . 
  just wikipedia can fill in the basics if you need to . 
  so what are your thoughts on the matter then ? 
  maximum utilitarianism ? 
  a mixture of pragmatism and culture , where the majority is appeased ? 
  people have many reasons to hate each other , and it 's unpredictable even what future ways they will concoct to justify bigotry . 
  true , but it 's just more efficient to have a single sovereign state , as i said in my first response . 
  it may not have many resources , but it can become a trading power like venice did , if it 's a city state for example . 
  we do n't break up countries into smaller states , mainly because we do n't need to ( that 's the whole point of administrative divisions ) . 
  politics , history , economy , nationalism , ethnolinguistics , etc are what keep a nation united . 
  depending on the situation , sovereign states may break up or unite , for a wide variety of reasons . 
  even if hypothetically we could break up every country in the world into millions of city states and small states , we would have to deal with the huge backtrack in human development set by this precedent . 
  eventually most places would start reuniting to be stronger together , and we would n't end up anywhere . 
  ah , my bad . 
  we do n't need too . 
  that 's why we have local administrators and systems of dividing them by counties . 
  countries can be a federation for example , where the states that make the country are mostly self-governing . 
  because it 's easier to manage a smaller country ?
