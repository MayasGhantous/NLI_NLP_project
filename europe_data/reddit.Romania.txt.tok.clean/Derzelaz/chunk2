  the textures for everything else however , are awful . 
  out of all the people , they decide to start worship the one that was worse than hitler . 
  hey , fight fire with fire . 
  why is the black sea just a lake ? 
  the slavers were a family of gypsies . 
  let 's hope that not every single dumb , brainless peasant will want to go to canada now ( like they did with italy , spain and uk ) . 
  maybe the plane prices will scare them off . 
  yeah , i can see how it can be a problem in that regard . 
   justifying terrorism on social media  international terrorism well , tbh , i kinda agree with those 2 . 
  1920 best year ever !, 
  hey , better safe than sorry . 
  `` hello , this is romania . 
   r/europe really hates putin . 
   i always thought it was the opposite you have n't been here long , have you ? 
  the west is against racism , but xenophobia is ok . 
   some even speculated that this was all a master plan by romania to export their gypsy population to other eu states . 
  we did n't plan it , but it was a nice side effect . 
  well , from a geographic point of view , and depending who you ask , you guys are part of the scandinavian peninsula, 
  still , it would be fun to relocate in romania just to annoy orban even more . 
  do n't they teach in russian schools exactly what stalin did ? 
  very few . 
  plus , when it happened , we lost it to russians , not to ukrainians ; if you get what i 'm trying to say . 
  the neighbors from upstairs that we rarely see or talk to , and because of that our opinion of them is completely neutral . 
  yeah , but their biggest advantage is that the public is going to support them , ** because ** they 're not ea , ubisoft . . etc, 
   cdproject is not an underdog not anymore . 
  we do have gas actually , that 's why we stopped importing gas from russia . 
  does that mean we can take back constantinople ? 
  i was born in '91 also , and all i remember from the 90s were cartoons in the morning on weekends , and playing football with my friends outside . 
  not a good thing when you live in the sewers . 
  well , at least we beat hungary . 
  we call those people americans . 
   honestly if you get your news off of facebook you suck anyway so getting my news from euronews , reuters and bbc 's facebook pages is bad ? 
  and for all the right reasons . 
  for me , this sub is a slightly more serious version of / r/polandball . 
  and i love it . 
  god damn it , not another one !, 
  honestly now , if you did n't bother to get citizenship in 60 years , you 're an idiot . 
  wait , wait , wait . 
  am i supposed to believe that over 100 people managed to fit inside that restaurant in the first place ? 
  this is a new level of pettiness . 
  i think that comment was meant to be sarcastic . 
  god damn it , not again !, 
  i would get mad , but that joke was too clever and true . 
   every eastern-european city wanted ( and still wants ) to be paris . 
  and only 2 succeeded , ** budapest and prague . 
  ** b-but ... but ... `` little paris '' ... 
  at least you 're trying , iceland . 
  why is everyone always ignoring the red ? 
  `` oops ! '', 
  not sure if i should laugh or feel sorry for them . 
  god damn it !, 
  took the swedish government some time to care about it 's own people . 
   the information leaked by ** buzzfeed ** now i 'm 100 % sure it 's fake . 
  outrage my ass , that was fucking hilarious !, 
  it was . 
  some french politicians made it very clear that they lack the ability to differentiate between a romanian and a gypsy . 
  that will never happen in eastern europe . 
  we are too xenophobic to let others have their way ( ca n't believe i 'm saying that in a good way ) . 
  we got ta pump those numbers up . 
  those are rookie numbers in this racket . 
  if poland is like that , imagine what china would look like . 
  he 's actually ethnic german . 
  there are greater chances that he will dissolve the parliament before he gets impeached . 
  if you guys do n't mind , i 'll just stay the fuck away from anything south of the equator ... and mexico . 
  ** want * to be occupied by russia . 
  because you speak the same language . 
  just as i would feel more kinship with a moldovan . 
  when i visited countries outside europe , i felt more european than romanian . 
  when you go outside , you will see that europe is basically one big culture , with some differences here and there depending on the country . 
   i did n't vote at all because i did n't care . 
  that actually makes you worse than those who voted for psd . 
  how much oil , sugar and flour did they give you to write that ? 
   makes them be attracted to people who seem to be strong leaders , even if those strong leaders will fuck their living standards . 
  that makes them stupid to me . 
  you have no idea how stupid the average romanian peasant is . 
   introduce a ban on voting for people at 60 + years . 
  problem solved . 
  that would solve so many problems in my country . 
  life . 
  two reasons why they won : 1 . 
  young people did n't go to vote . 
  old people from the country side ( some of them admitted that they do n't even know what elections these are for ) voted for whoever the mayor or someone else told them . 
  or for the ones who practically bribed them with flour , sugar and vegetable oil . 
  `` where the hell is that sound coming from ?! '', 
  i did n't use adblock when the adds were small banners on the side or top of a page . 
  i started using adblock however , when i had to wait for a 30 sec add , to watch a 10 sec video . 
   `` refugees run from shelters in romania , so they can get into western europe . 
  one third of the migrants caught trying to get out of the country illegaly , are asylum applicants . 
  this week , 42 people who asked for protection from the romanian state hid inside a tanker , hoping that they will arrive in germany . '', 
  we use `` pula '' pretty much the same way you would use `` fuck '' in english , in a conversation . 
  how come he had an actual haircut back then ? 
  i 'm still waiting for the day when boris johnson will give 2 shits about how his hair looks . 
  i think * mountains * is the most ridiculous one , for obvious reasons . 
  i think you can also add channel 4 to that list . 
   to hide their identity lem me just show their entire face tho . 
   ** moscow has demanded an explanation from the swiss government ** after military jets buzzed a russian government aircraft . 
   three swiss air force f/a -18 fighter jets unexpectedly joined a russian passenger plane carrying diplomats and journalists to a conference in peru ** as it flew over switzerland . 
  ** i 'm pretty sure the swiss can do whatever they want on their country 's territory . 
  why ? 
  the sultan can do whatever he wants , without the approval of the peasantry .
