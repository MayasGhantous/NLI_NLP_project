  you take all the muslims out of france . 
  you 're left with europeans and french . 
  can women chose what to wear in france ? 
  yes . 
  now you put muslims back in . 
  in muslim culture , saying to your husband that you 'd like to not wear that damn hijab will be met with him punching you in the face . 
  can women wear what they want in france ? 
  who 's fault is it ? 
  now what do you do ? 
  you ban the things they force their women to wear . 
  they either accept that , or they 're free to feel `` oppressed '' , leave the country , or if going south , to fill the prisons . 
  edit : inb4 `` some might want to wear them '' - you do n't know that . 
  you do n't . 
  by defending hijabs , burkas , burkinis etc , you 're only defending the muslim man 's power to chose what his wife can wear . 
  ok , this is my last comment on these issues . 
  it 's pointless ... 
  i 'd like for another source other than bbc for that bit of info . 
  if it proves to be true ( would n't surprise me ) : people are clearly restless with terrorist attacks and with *** having to deal for years and years with muslims refusing to properly integrate in their country *** . 
  when discussing current western acceptance of someone who is different vs islamic acceptance of the different , it 's not even a competition . 
  that woman was putting her religion above french law , further signaling in the minds of the french some peoples ' refusal to integrate . 
  lastly , my comment was n't about some people *** allegedly *** shouting that they 're catholics , as i was n't aware that bbc is claiming that - that info is not in the op - but talking about being honest about the differences of what catholicism currently means for the french vs what islam currently means for muslims . 
  also , again , i 'll wait for another source other than bbc . 
  she can not opt out of wearing them . 
  she might want to wear them , she might not . 
  we do not know . 
  because they can not chose . 
  that choice is made for them . 
  my father only lets me eat fish . 
  i only eat fish . 
  i eat nothing but fish , not at home , not outside , because i 'm afraid he 'll be very , very angry if he catches me ( in this scenario , i 'm 12 , lol ) . 
  you only see me eating fish . 
  do you have any idea what i 'd like to eat ? 
  i might like fish , i might hate fish , but one thing 's for certain , i can only eat fish . 
  how do we verify that ? 
  you can not give me the freedom of eating fish , cause i 'm technically free to , it 's my father that does n't let me . 
  so what do you do ? 
  you do n't allow me and those like me to eat fish until everybody gets it drilled in their heads that eating only fish is not mandatory . 
  in this country , people can eat what they want . 
  after you filter those who can not accommodate , and give time for the others to do so , you now let me eat fish . 
  trust me , in this scenario , i 'll never eat fish for the rest of my life . 
  well , others might . 
  but probably most people wo n't . 
  soo ... what 's your point ? 
  i might have not met your grandparents , and i do not need to . 
  there are tons of studies on all populations in europe , by country , by age , by sex , by whatever you want , for me to look at . 
  if you claim that religion plays the same role in westerners ' values as they do in muslims ' , are you really going to be that disingenuous ? 
  drinking alcohol and ( boys ) having premarital sex is not an accommodation . 
  here 's what it is : the gradual realization that their muslim social norms are antiquated and unnecessary in the prosperous , socially equal ( relatively ) and secular western countries . 
  also , why mention premarital sex when we know that women are ostracized for engaging in it , and acceptance for premarital sex has happened mostly for males ? 
  lets . 
  stop . 
  being . 
  the issue is with all of this are n't convenient `` accommodations '' - not to mention that burkinis ** are hardly a laudable accommodation - seriously ... ? - ** . 
  the muslims you talk about are the ones still having * some of the most antiquated and counter-productive customs * , are the ones for which homophobia and misogyny are a mainstay etc. 
  if you keep denying the problem , it will only get worse . 
  ban anything which lets them develop an `` us vs them '' mentality , and if they can not accept that they live in france and in france women are free to wear what they want , and they ca n't chose for their women what they should wear , ban them . 
  you are only defending women 's oppression . 
  me neither . 
  but it is the necessary evil when you have a parallel society developing in which women can not chose what to wear . 
  baring the choice between , i dunno , blue and brown . 
  you did n't click the link , did you ? 
  as if getting a punch in the face for mentioning to your muslim husband that it would be nice if you could choose what to wear is fair . 
  sure , defend fucking burkinis . 
  we all know you 're happy that you 're not a muslim women with no option to not wear what she 's told to . 
  the people you describe simply think that `` we know better '' . 
  we understand . 
  sadly , they know nothing ... 
  great . 
  lets start with burkinis then !, 
  your catholic comparison has absolutely no relevancy . 
  i wo n't even go into the nuances you missed about catholic behaviour ( not to mention that *** catholicism has in no way the same importance in westerns ' lives as islam has for ... islamists *** ) . 
  just because x does bad does n't mean y now has the right to also do bad . 
  false equivalency . 
  horrendous fallacy . 
  getting tired of these ... edit : have some balls and explain your downvotes !, 
  i meant brains . 
  it 's not about terrorists !, 
  stop with this shoehorning . 
  it 's about their french society and culture . 
  and yes , [ it is about women 's rights ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4z3pzj/burkas_may_be_banned_from_public_places_in_germany/d6t4n72 ) . 
  one thing often overlooked when talking about different `` multicultures '' is the compatibility and contrasts between the cultures who compose the `` multiculture '' . 
  a multiculture made up of french and english cultures will be much more homogeneous and socially stable than one made up of nigerians and south koreans . 
  lets stop oversimplifying things . 
  also , clearly , the cultural contrasts between europeans and natives did not end well , we can cut natives off your list ( of course now everything is relatively ok , the natives who did not accept or later adapt well enough to the colonialists ' culture died in war or in poverty ) . 
  now you 're left with a multuculture of french and english . 
  clearly , the french have a distinct culture from the english . 
  but ... not really ... you can not write about the history of one without writting about the history of the other just as much . 
  you could try , but it would be bad history . 
  not to mention , a new culture formed in the `` new world '' because it was populated by like-minded colonialists , usually out for the same things which was separate than the original one : colonial french had , apart from language , more in common with colonial english than with european french . 
  not to mention further that it took a number of good fights for the french and the english to just live together in canada . 
  so there goes your myth of problem-free multiculturalism in canada . 
  apart from that , immigration in canada from atlantic/european parts make the bulk of their total immigration , and the culture of these are now overlapping on so many parts incompatibility is hardly a concern . 
  wow ... 
  the joke really flew past many people 's head . 
  a source and a timestamp ? 
  not skeptical , not at all , but it 's kinda required ... edit : / s. . . 
  sigh ... 
  then what are you talking about ? 
  what more is there to your argument apart from that false equivalency ? 
  this is islamic extremism at its core .
