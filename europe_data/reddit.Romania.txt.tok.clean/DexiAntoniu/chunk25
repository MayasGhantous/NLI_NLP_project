  but `` fuck 'em '' is a bit too much . 
  you got ta understand that different people develop both memetically and genetically ways of coping with different environments . 
  the roma are deeply nomadic and thus very unruly . 
  that 's their problem , that 's why they 're crime prone and do n't integrate properly . 
  but they yield easily to proper authority . 
  if the european states stopped looking at them like at retards and actually understood that they have deep pools of resourcefulness , they 'd make for very productive citizens . 
  meanwhile , the west offers them pity , `` tolerance '' , money when they beg and welfare ( which they abuse crassly ) and the east just wants nothing to do with them because of their bad reputation . 
  they are salvageable and can be extraordinary people . 
  they just need to be told that they ca n't complain and not left to their own devices . 
  if there 's any way for a roma community to be unruly , they will always take it . 
  it 's just how they got to survive this long , as a people . 
  did you again delete your post ? 
  those are some good points . 
  you must not be very familiar with that areas layout . 
  or , of course , i 'm reading waaay too much into that post . 
  but i dunno ... 
  someone tipped 4chan off a couple of days ago that the forums would begin being flooded with child pornography , so that the boards will come under mainstream attack and closed . 
  that , of course , did not happen ( although alleged attempts did pop up , but who can say if those were n't actual 4chan users trying to fake it ) . 
  however , if , if , *** if *** someone was indeed out to get 4chan , the tip off would 've obviously stopped that . 
  and *** if *** that did n't work , this might be the next best thing - *** assuming *** someone had prior knowledge of this attack and was out to get 4chan . 
  which , tbh , would n't be that surprising considering the role they had in disseminating some information and countering some narratives surrounding a specific election . 
  it 's not a coincidence and i 'm starting to feel like shilling is involved on discussions about this on reddit . 
  the message is clear . 
  *** `` attack will happen at this location . 
  '' *** the gun stands in for `` attack '' . 
  think about it . 
  if you were to alert about an incoming attack in a cryptic way , that 's how you 'd do it . 
  the gun can just be a symbol for an attack . 
  it 's a cryptic message . 
  `` violence will happen at this location . '', 
  both `` violence '' and the location are conveyed cryptically . 
  the 4chan post pinpointed the location of the attack . 
  pinpointed . 
  the gun might 've just been a warning that an attack will happen , not that that 's literally the gun with which the attack will happen/happened . 
  the 4chan post happened yesterday , and it pinpointed the location of the attack . 
  pinpointed . 
  the gun might 've just been a warning that an attack will happen , not that that 's literally the gun with which the attack will happen/happened . 
  i used to be a hardcore environmentalist ( still am somewhat ) . 
  that being said : merkel can shove her own finger in her populist arsch . 
  being in the community and being subjected to its economy , but not being into schengen = suffering all of its negatives and seeing none of its benefits . 
  holy mother, 
  it is still very bad alright , but not the same thing . 
  if you want to be hardcore fundamentalist about it , sure , go right ahead . 
  just do n't expect common sense to take you seriously . 
  you actually argue against having more context and nuance when discussing a pretty sensitive issue ... 
  i fel liek we underschtad eacuther, 
  my god you people ... 
  i 'd turn the cheek against anything , but against all you naysayers itt trying to paint the dude as an alt-righter just to discredit him , i 'd get a hold of a belt for you , you drive me insane . 
  just watch the damned interviews and judge for yourself . 
  you clearly have n't so far and you 're talking out of your ass . 
  you 're not making a generic complaint , you are right . 
  whatever `` mark '' they set before , it was nothing but the usual , token crap as they are aware of those issues . 
  this more recent and more powerful rhetoric about the industry is just an attempt at cashing into the trend , nothing more . 
  typical politician crap . 
  well he should use the proper words . 
  not rebrand old ones so he does n't have to bother actually being informed on the subject matter . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  but the premise that i was challenging was that of becoming indistinguishable from the natives . 
  i am glad you posted that , because it helps me make the point that i wanted : cultural compatibility happens on a spectrum . 
  from the ability to become indistinguishable , to that of being perfectly functional to incompatibility . 
  i am not saying that pakistanis are culturally incompatible with the british , just that there are different vectors of compatibility from case to case . 
  and have the pakistani 's become indistinguishable from the natives in the last couple of decades ? 
  not from what i 've seen . 
  so there 's clearly something different going on there . 
  your belittling is not an argument . 
  again , this is why remain lost . 
  this thread entirely misses the takeaway here . 
  it 's precisely because london will be ok almost no matter what that those regions who are already impoverished voted leave . 
  those people feel like they have been impoverished precisely so that london big bucks will prosper eternally . 
  brexit was one of the rarest chances they felt they had to roll back on this , as faulty of a roll back as it is . 
  people antagonizing and vilifying them did nothing but help leave and continue to prove their point now . 
  it does not matter , the narrative must be upheld !, 
  here 's why you 're wrong mate : there are gigantic , enormous benefits to the eu coming from romania joining the club . 
  you wo n't see them . 
  eu investors , big companies , politicians , bankers - they will see them though . 
  the average romanian sees plenty of benefits from being in the eu , but that 's mainly because the politicians have a watchdog ( hardly effective , but better than nothing ) and that the people have a role model . 
  plenty of average romanians also got fucked and plenty still do . 
  from farmers getting their land stolen , to regulations killing certain domestic entrepreneurial initiatives , to forests getting cut up , to forced mergers and acquisitions , to increased corruption by european businesses buying off politicians to name a few . 
  life is a mixture of good and bad . 
  romania is n't in schengen ... 
  does n't matter , ideology and ` my side must be right ' is all that counts . 
  if you 'd do a fairer ( but still unfair ) comparison , like comparing sweden to nyc as they have a similar population , guess who 's coming on top ? 
  what 's happening ? 
  who 's rioting ? 
  this is your last warning : hate trump , fulfill your mandatory quota of 10 shoehorned trump hate posts in discussions that have nothing to do with him . 
  or we shadowban you , you racist . 
  does n't surprise me at all . 
  italy was the first to develop a big romanian gypsy diaspora . 
  if you know romanian and/or rromani , italian is the easiest foreign language to learn . 
  that 's ... well , surprisingly accurate ... 
  romania is n't ukraine . 
  it most definitely is . 
  but we 're close to a buffer state , there 's little else that it 's needed for russia to assess us as a threat . 
  they can not actively protect their territorial integrity without buffer states , that is the russian geopolitical woe . 
  as such , russia escalates any potentially troublesome sign to `` awaiting for hostile countermeasures '' and escalates any hostility on a logarithmic scale . 
  they are hyperalert . 
  they do n't like anything so close to them being so in the spotlight and so active , ready for mass mobilisation as romania seemed to be in the last couple of weeks . 
  imo , the best way for romania to deal with russia right now is to strongly reassure them that we have nothing to do with them and try to deflect aggression and be friendly . 
  the west will never perish the ussr through force . 
  it needs to implant into russia that which putin and russian politicians hate the most : dissent .
