  i was n't early , there was no thread for me to hijack , so the only thing left is to put a bunch of bold and italics and caps to grab people 's attention ... a bit despicable , i know , but the question required a nuanced and less biased response . 
  attention !, 
  the following post could be upsetting to you , regardless of your political bias - we are indeed witnessing the first 21st century information war and like in all wars , all sides do * bad * things , russia and germany , righties and lefties , pro and anti-immigration , all sides : - `` fake news '' is a term coined almost in concert by mainstream media of a left leaning bias to *** correctly *** describe a string of emerging websites which pose as legit news outlets but which spread ** fake or at least inaccurate ** ( but mostly fake ) stories . 
  - most `` fake news '' outlets are *** allegedly *** of russian origin . 
  but it is safe to assume that at least a part of them are russian , given that russia is indeed demonstrably waging an info war . 
  - the * left leaning mainstream media * has coined this term with ** the short-term future goal in mind of ** *** de-legitimizing all news stories of politically opposed news outlets *** . 
  basically a strategy to familiarize the public with a notion of `` bad '' and then lump all opposition in that category of `` bad '' , given that the public is ready to accept that . 
  - a lot of people * had fallen casualty to the info war so far * , because a lot of people picked a side and got entrenched , ** one side ** falling for fake news en masse , ** the other side ** pushing that all politically opposed news is fake news . 
  - because war is a dirty business , the left-leaning mainstream media has *** been caught red handed with their own lies , big biases , misrepresentations , inaccuracies , bad journalistic ethics *** etc , even completely false or at least unverifiable news stories . 
  - then , the ** right-leaning mainstream media ** has seized the opportunity and in turn painted back ** its ** political opposition as fake news . 
  basically turning the left 's msm attempt back at them , `` cnn = fake news '' etc. 
  - now everybody uses the term to harp on news outlets of a different political view when they portray inaccurately something they support - it is easy for everyone to say something is fake news because all media has been proven to be extremely biased and divided - the reality ? 
  `` if you thought trump is anti-lgbt , you 've read fake news '' ( correct !, 
  trump himself has never been outspoken against lgbtq , he was even the first presidential candidate to announce support for the group , even [ flying a rainbow lgbt flag in the rnc ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000278683690-e1477918417109.jpg?w=960&amp;strip=all ) , whilst hillary was against gay marriage - pro traditional marriage - up until this decade , switching stances in 2013 , although it is important to note that people close to trump have allegedly been against lgbt rights in the past ) . 
  - `` if you thought that italy was having a referendum to exit the eu , you 've read fake news '' . 
  - `` if you think le pen has a change of winning the french presidency and are convinced that eu is bad for member nations , you 've read fake news '' . 
  - `` if you think that the nature of the eu - an economic and monetary union , but not a political and fiscal union - is not damaging some countries when other stronger countries are pushing for their profit , you 've read fake news '' . 
  - `` if you think that putin is the good guy ... you 've read fake news '' . 
  - `` if you think putin is the antichrist and is literally capable of destabilizing the usa and the eu single handedly ... you know it already . 
  fake news '' . 
  the truth is that everything has been politicized , starting with academia and journalism and ending at nothing . 
  we are living in a post-truth world not because there are too many lies , but because people want to believe them . 
  u/leadingthenet gives a good summary of it , yes . 
  the takeaway is that transilvania was for most of its existence as a province lived on by romanians ruled by a magyar minority . 
  culturally transilvania was hungarian/germanic/hapsburgic for a long time because the romanian majority living there were not given almost any rights . 
  they 're a minority even in the counties they are most concentrated into . 
  they 've been manipulated into acts of terrorism before , and would those counties hold a democratic vote , it would fail to result into their secession . 
  those facts hardly sum up to any sort of compelling argument . 
  that 's why i support the vote , i 'm 100 % certain it would fail , demographics do n't allow it to win . 
  and then maybe this topic would finally die . 
  it would be nice if you 'd stop being divisive . 
  if at any point any region of this country wants to self determinate and votes to be a part of another country , i 'll fully support that . 
  but right now , when you can as a hungarian travel anywhere in romania , buy land , work etc. 
  and you 're effectively not missing out on anything , spouting revisionist crap is pretty stupid and pointless . 
  whatever you say buddy ... 
  the carpathian mountains are the reason it took romanians a lot of time to form their own nation . 
  the carpathian mountains act like a border inside the former dacian/roman provinces , they effectively incentivize greater geopolitical entities ( if present ) to want to extend their own borders to the mountains . 
  you 'd expect their layout to favour the creation of 3 provinces because of its curvature , and that is exactly what you see : transilvania , falling into to influence of whatever comes from the west ( hungarians ) contained by the curve , moldova to that of easterners ( russia ) contained by the mountain range west side and the the danubian delta south side , and valahia to that of southerners ( historically greek/ottoman ) . 
  i do n't think you understood what i tried to say , might be my fault for how i expressed myself . 
  i 'm just as glad as you , rest assured !, 
  it is often said that surprise is a big element of comedy . 
  consequently , with no intention , i read the headline and i go `` hahah ... wait ... lem me read that again '' . 
  and then it stopped being funny ... 
  no one will ever have the same privileges . 
  this is coming from an individual who has made something good for himself being born in possibly one of the most unprivileged circumstances imaginable in europe . 
  the privilege paradigm is just as inconsistent and utterly irrelevant to any mature observation of the real world as the just world fallacy . 
  equal education is equal chance , not equal outcome , but regardless this is a semantics argument and we both know what i mean by outcome equity . 
  and i do n't see what 's hard to be understood , i said i absolutely support a life dedicated to the betterment of all around you , that is so different from the concept of equal outcome i feel like bashing my head with a hammer after gauging my eyes out and bitting my fingers off for having to explain it . 
  you ca n't ensure equal prosperity for all . 
  no matter how morally warm that idea feels . 
  never . 
  period . 
  that does n't mean it 's pointless to work towards the betterment of all people , there 's no life better lived than towards that purpose . 
  but * equal * prosperity for all , as in outcome equality , if that is what you mean , is not only impossible but is a dangerous ideal to pursue , not to mention a highly dystopic and tremendously damaging psychologically and socially . 
  here 's my upboat, 
  he 's talking about a bloody communist revolution and he 's not trying to be subtle about it , lmao, 
  well , * that * kind of `` romanian '' , know what i mean ? 
  haha , i rejoice at the thought of incoming downvotes !!!, 
  arguments do n't matter here , because there 's a narrative : eastern countries are leeches and useless and they should be happy we give them money asking nothing in return . 
  the purpose of the narrative is of course for when they do ask something in return : complete obedience . 
  the brain drain , the foreign land and capital grab , the eu development funds which go to foreign corporations that do a piss poor job , not to ours , the under the counter mergers and acquisitions and all the other things , none of it matters , there 's always an excuse . 
  we should just be happy and do what we 're told . 
  you ca n't be stylish if you ca n't afford it . 
  oh , i completely agree with you on pizzagate . 
  although it would n't be without precedent ( thinking of the very real pizzagate going on in the uk ) i 'm not saying pizzagate is a proven thing . 
  however , podesta has an undeniably shade past and bill was very close to epstein ( much more so than trump , no point in being disingenuous ) - these are things that were never touched on by any mainstream coverage on the subject . 
  the mainstream media coverage on the subject was `` russia reeee , if you have any suspicion you 're kkk '' . 
  downvotes galore , there hardly is any news outlet as profilic in spreading fake news as cnn . 
  i 'm sorry , but `` big media outlets debunked it already '' makes you look like you hardly have any idea what you are talking about . 
  you 're talking about the same big media outlets who ( illogically ) claimed it 's illegal to read the leaked emails and that only they can do it , just so you wo n't read how they illegally collaborated with the clinton campaign , gave hillary all the debate questions before the debates , asked the clinton campaign what they should say about bernie to make him look bad , participated in organizing agitators/false flags at trump rallies . 
  the big news outlets that irresponsibly warmonger against russia . 
  so , when will they fire wolf blitzer ? 
  when will they fire those who said that reading the emails is illegal , just so you ca n't read how they illegally collaborated with clinton 's campaign ? 
  you know what really irks me ? 
  that you recognize you have n't watched cnn and i guess you have n't watched much rt either . 
  so how in the world can you equate the two ? 
  from what information are you speaking ? 
  look , i 'm glad you came around thanks to / u/mynicknameisunique but fuckin hell man , what made you just type that out ? 
  you see , that 's fake news , or at least how fake news spread . 
  it 's people 's biases , not the information . 
  you do realize that bill clinton used to publicly be good friends with a now well recognized pedophile , right ? 
  i 'm not saying pizzagate is real , but outright calling it a hoax says more about where you get your news than about other peoples ' . 
  the cnn outright lied that it 's illegal to read the emails but they can do it and they 'll tell you what 's in them . 
  lied . 
  because they knew people would find out about donna brazile and wolf blitzer . 
  we 're talking about completely different issues . 
  fake news = / = confirmation bias . 
  how people seem supportive of this ministry of truth just because it so happens that mainstream media is overwhelmingly leftist ( with notable expections ) honestly scares me and disgusts me . 
  `` it 's illegal for you to read those emails !, 
  not for us though , we 're cnn , if does n't make sense , just trust us , we know this , you do n't . 
  we 'll tell you what 's in the emails ! '', 
  `` hey , do n't be upset we illegally collaborated with the dnc and the clinton campaign and gave hillary the debate questions beforehand , but not bernie , and we coordinated with them to illegally discredit bernie !, 
  it 's the russians ' fault you 're upset cause they told you !, 
  give us all the lands and corporations we had to tacitly give to enter the eu and refund us for all the crappy infrastructure projects western companies wasted money on and sure , we 'll leave the eu . 
  i do n't have anything to do with people like you . 
  what ? 
  we warned about this since the beginning , subsets of the german political class took full responsibility for allowing uncontrolled border crossings when it was obvious from the beginning that this was not going to be supported by other member states . 
  they did this regardless . 
  i 'm kinda sick and tired of all the eastern bashing , so i wrote these lyrics : * fuck discrimination comin ' straight from romania . 
  * * a white boy cut no slack cuz he 's from transylvania * * and not the other nationalities , so wester ` ns think , * * they piss on the majority because of a minority .
