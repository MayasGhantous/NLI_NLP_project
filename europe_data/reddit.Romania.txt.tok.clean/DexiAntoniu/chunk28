  i meant our outside borders , the eu ones , not the inside borders . 
  what 's the point of the eu if we 're gon na enforce inside borders ? 
  what 's the worry ? 
  the germans crossing borders to france to steal cheese recipes ? 
  of course most refugees are good people and deserve all the help they can get , not because we have a responsibility but because we have a heart . 
  at least in christmas times should we think like that . 
  but that still does n't mean that we ( by that i mean our politicians ) should n't have acted preemptively , enforced our external union borders and create eu funded asylum sorting centers in greece/italy and turkey , lebanon etc. 
  instead of doing nothing and allowing uncontrolled migration . 
  we 'd have done better by sorting out who needs our help the most and turning away opportunists and incompatible ( aggressive ) people while we still could 've . 
  the ones needing our help the most are still stuck at the whims of isis in syria and at the scowls of the turkish . 
  yeah , we 're talking about a country with so many poverty and education problems that many of some 3 million people just voted what they were told to by their local priest or by one tv channel . 
  those are the real issues in our country . 
  fix those and it also fixes the consequence you brought forth . 
  i seriously doubt the german police would let him loose if they had any suspicions regarding him . 
  i hope they catch the real killer . 
  and i hope someone gets him to talk honestly about just what in the hell made him do it , i just can not wrap my head around the motivations and the thought process behind his decision ... how well is the police funded in germany ? 
  i know i 'll be told that this is exactly what the terrorists want , but i think people should join the police force in significant numbers with the support of your politicians , because i fear that if you guys do n't catch that person soon , it will be taken as a sign of weakness by other like minded individuals . 
  anyway , barring all the shit i talk and all the jackass itoldyouso 's , i 'm really sad and i wish you people a quick resolve towards peace again . 
  be safe . 
  what about all the other assholes who did similar things recently ? 
  i 'm not asking why he picked that spot , i was asking why did he do it . 
  look , i do n't care if i disgust you , and i do n't care for your petty insults . 
  if imagining me as bitter and all that makes you feel better , glad i 'm of help . 
  you made plenty of baseless assumptions and constructed your arguments for an imaginary discussion , all i did was ask you questions in a neutral tone . 
  i have n't insulted you and i have assumed nothing about you . 
  now tell me , who acted bitterly ? 
  well , i wish you a better day than you had so far !, 
  then why did he do it ? 
  why do these keep happening ? 
  you people can only discuss this by assuming the other said/meant things he actually did not , cause you do n't actually have a case . 
  where did i give off that impression ? 
  when did i said any of that ? 
  what are the facts , you brought none forth ? 
  i 'm not a christian , fyi . 
  i 'm not saying it was an attack on christianity . 
  i was only asking you why do you think this attack happened , and then pointed out that you contradict yourself . 
  you gon na pretend like i said something i did n't like a weasel again , or are we done ? 
  cause i 'm getting pretty bummed out . 
  that was a joke about him having a big dick . 
  that 's why the mod said it 's ok . at most you can say that comment is seen as controversial by some people . 
  any other , real example ? 
  if it oly takes like 30 seconds i 'm guessing it wo n't be a problem . 
  so then you *** do go to berlin to attack christians *** if you perceive people there to be predominantly christians . 
  you 're basically contradicting your other post . 
  by the way , the attack 's ties with isis have yet to be proven ( regardless of whether isis will take credit for it , which they always do regardless ) . 
  who said that ? 
  please link us some cases , cause i have n't seen any . 
  not claiming there are n't , just that i have n't seen any . 
  who said all muslims are rapists in here ? 
  ok , so what determines a pakistani/afghani to hijack a polish truck and drive it in a christmas market in berlin ? 
  is it the role that `` western nations '' played in the destabilization of me ? 
  cause if he was pakistani , that ca n't be it . 
  not that in all likelihood the victims of such an attack had absolutely no say and nothing to do with said destabilization . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i just said there are n't many . 
  actually , i 'll go back on that one . 
  there are plenty of arabs/turks in bucharest , lots . 
  but they are all very chill 'n' cool . 
  and they 're here because bucharest is about that $ $ $ . 
  as for your claim of extremism , back it up . 
  source it with something . 
  you learnt a new word , `` bubble '' , you think using it automatically makes you right ? 
  beat it, 
  lmao , how so ? 
  well , not enough . 
  12 people that could have still lived . 
  no muslim extremists in romania . 
  wan na know why ? 
  we do n't have that many and the ones we do have need to integrate . 
  no nationalist extremism either cause there 's nothing to trigger it . 
  you 're wrong on almost all accounts , there 's also a lot of cognitive dissonance going on there . 
  not only that , but you assume i said things i did n't say just so you can cobble up a counter-argument . 
  i will proceed to thoroughly destroy anything you think you can come up with to defend the course of action germany has taken ( only god knows why you 're still doing it instead of admitting it was wrong and just be done with it ) tomorrow after work . 
   you 're disgracing the victims of the two terrorists attacks that have happened in your country today , and all the pain that could 've been avoided . 
  ... for someone not believing in propaganda , well , you appear to have been brainwashed quite well . 
  i guess what you said is exactly what someone 's who 's been eating propaganda would say . 
  [ you literally only have to google what i 'm talking about to be sent to the relevant wiki page ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/dublin_regulation ) . 
  although , that wiki page is heavily redacted . 
  basically , we had an europe-wide law that said that all asylum seekers must be tagged on their moment of entrance in the first eu country they come into and that external and internal borders must be enforced . 
  after refusing to enforce it ( thus silently suspending it and incentivizing refugees across 3 continents to be smuggled in the eu , overburdening greece , italy and transit countries such as hungary ) , germany made it official that it has *** unilaterally *** suspended the dublin agreement . 
  i 'm sorry , but your grave ignorance does not pass for a shield against propaganda . 
  wow , you really are clueless , are n't you ? 
  and germany deciding for everyone to abandon border regulations and incentivize smuggling operations across 3 continents and then shove a badly thought out relocation scheme was not unilateral action ? 
  they did n't win because of soros narrative . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  they won because people generally are clueless . 
  across all of the political spectrum . 
  the soros narrative is just confirmation bias for those who would 've voted psd anyway . 
  psd won because not enough people went to vote to upset the votes of the elderly . 
  it always happens , nothing has changed . 
  ca n't remember the last time psd was n't majority or part of majority coalition on the parliament . 
  i understand were you come from with your opinion , but it is n't the case here . 
  i had to google what ancap is the abbreviation of ... 
  i really have no idea what you are talking about with that paragraph . 
  also , what 's the bill that you linked called ? 
  that 's hilarious lmao dude , not everyone is so thin skinned .
