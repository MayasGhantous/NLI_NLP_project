  nobody should be that thin skinned , that 's what you snowflakes do n't get . 
  i 'm not triggered at all . 
  i 'll be the first one to admit i 'm a pickpocketing , wife beating , mother screwing gypsy cunt :d, 
  yeah , legally obliging people to call me a velociraptor because i say so ... lotsa folks would call me a somethingphobe for not agreeing with them , as clear discrimination against people who do not share their ideology . 
  should we criminalize them to ? 
  that blog post uses a lot of euphemisms and doublespeak but behind those it does nothing to assert its title . 
  weak . 
  also calling that jordan dude , whom i know , a right winger and a propagandist is incredibly low and sad . 
  precisely why people have lost faith in progressive rhetoric . 
   it 's not a plan , it 's a pipe dream . 
  plans have actionable details . 
  proclaimed the people who said `` let the immigrants do as they please , we 'll sort it out later '' - lol - hoping for an unsustainable distribution scheme for the half of the immigrants which would n't have gone underground . 
  sure buddy , keep talking smack on us all you want . 
  you 're making a lot of false assumptions , starting with second sentence . 
  i wo n't bother addressing those , because it 's not what i meant . 
  i do however agree with your preposition that common policies are absolutely the key . 
  we dug ourselves in this mess mess because of individual countries acting unilaterally . 
  well , you 'd be surprised , lol . 
  i 'm not dissing on them , i quite respect them . 
  i know their rudeness is circumstantial . 
  totally different country , totally different cultures , totally different people . 
  but from what i 've seen , they 're a pretty sneaky bunch . 
  oh my god , are you serious ? 
  lmao, 
  there are issues and execution obstacles irrespective of what solution you chose to pursue . 
  so if you net those out of all the solutions , what you 're left with is safe borders and controlled refugee acceptance vs open borders , illegal crossings , thousands of people going underground and denying themselves the opportunity of integrating , social tensions , parallel communities etc. 
  i 'm kinda done replying , i 've been down this path before . 
  because the alternative that happened was clearly a plan ... 
  the chinese are more and more present here , even in the smaller cities . 
  i was visiting my home town one day and i was quite a bit surprised . 
  yeah , they 're generally pretty ok and focused on their small businesses or jobs , but they are totally oblivious to their rudeness . 
  it 's a much safer plan , you can poke however many holes you want in it . 
  we should 've tried to do that . 
  now we 're stuck with this . 
  yeah , we do n't want to sort refugees here , we wanted to sort them in their african/middle eastern camps . 
  solves all problems . 
  but we 're racists so then open borders , letting them go underground and ignoring the obvious potential crime that could sprout whilst praying that we have enough money and political will to actually redistribute those few who have indeed registered as refugees and have not gone underground is a much better alternative . 
  those stupid easterners !, 
  should i believe then that all black rights activists believe in #killallwhitemen , or that all feminists think `` masculinity '' is toxic ? 
  those guys basically hijacked the denominations for an entire political spectrum just to appear more legit . 
  or maybe i do n't know what the alt-right is . 
  i used to think i 'm alt right because i am against pc culture , and i do truly think that concepts such as `` white privilege '' when used as a blanket accusation are ludicrous , i 'm tired of blanket academic biases against studies such as environmental determinism and the general politicizing of humanistic academia and the perpetuation of nonsense such as the pay gap ( which should be called what it really is : an income gap , the difference being a pay gap is not something you can solve because economically and legally it simply can not exist in 2016 , whilst an income gap is quite real and something we can actually solve , but `` pay gap '' is easier to speak about when you know nothing about economics , so it 's a error deliberately transformed into a rhetoric point ) . 
  i do not however believe in racial supremacy ( the simple act of typing that made me wan na puke ) , true sexism etc. 
  i thought ( and still hope ) that alt-right are mostly people like me , tired of millennial-liberalism nonsense and with their sights on real issues on all sides of the isle : systemic racism perpetrated through the war on drugs and private prisons , the horrors caused by western intervention in 2nd/3rd world countries , the effects giant corporations have on global labor markets through globalization ( ruining labor markets at home and their exploitation of cheap labor elsewhere ) , liberal media 's unwillingness to acknowledge irreconcilable cultural differences between people coming from different nations and the way said media is exploited by corrupt politicians , unveiling the true nature of the eu and the hegemonic tendencies of germany - with the expressed goal of a more united eu , which can not happen as long as politicians hide behind empty words and we argue in euphemisms - etc. 
  it 's become quite clear to me that the whole vanilla political spectrum , the left and the right are nothing but a circus and i was hoping that a new wave of no-nonsense political rhetoric was born with the alt-right . 
  i 'm not yet willing to give up on them just because some jackasses highjacked the name . 
  not yet . 
  sir , that 's not true . 
  the alt-right are not one thing , the alt-right is a *** spectrum *** , a denomination for an incoherent and heterogeneous class of groups which have only 2 things in common : 1 ) their disapproval of what they see as the regressive left : identity politics , political correctness , 3rd wave feminism and its rhetorical alliance with islamism , ideological fundamentalism bordering religiosity ( how you ca n't consider some things out lout without being labeled a heretic : sexist , racist etc ) , the heavy politicizing done to academia ( the break down of the scientific process in human studies such as psychology - google about its replicability issues and how that ties with prevalent political views ) , forced multiculturalism and other details of this kind . 
  2 ) their lack of representation by the mainstream right . 
  so far , all the different and disparate groups that have been labeled as alt right have those two in common . 
  that means , among many many other : - a large subset of comedians - neo-nazis - men 's rights activist - classical libertarians - un-religious social conservatives - anti-globalization people - right wing puritans , such as freedom of speech champions the alt right are certainly not neo-nazis , although some consider some neo-nazi-like groups to be alt-right . 
  saying that the alt-right are neo-nazis is a fallacy , a dirty reductio ad hitlerum and i assure you it only shows you as uninformed and biased . 
  the alt-right is a *** different *** political spectrum , not a subset of the current one . 
  that 's why it is alt-right , not because its in between classical right and far right , but because modern notions of the right do n't serve them . 
  i do n't see how they do . 
  what ? 
  i agree there 's no discussion to be had here , but not because of the same reasons . 
  well , it being the sentiment you got is pretty exemplary of my dissatisfaction with the `` it felt right '' argument ; you see how these can be misleading . 
  apart from that , it might just be the tougher environment that i grew up in , but i do n't feel like anyone has an obligation to be altruistic . 
  it feels nice , and it is good , and i personally try to be as altruistic as i can ( oh geezus , look at me , so righteous ) , but i know most people do n't think like that and/or have a certain limit to that altruism . 
  unlawful and uncontrolled border crossings ( apart from gifting us with sleeper isis agents ) is a bad way at helping the people in need , because it does n't differentiate between the refugees and the opportunists - and it drives people towards that limit of their altruism . 
  this is the old argument , but you ca n't get around that , and we 've reaped the `` benefits '' of that already and we will keep doing it . 
  deporting the opportunists after they already got here is incredibly hard , we ca n't prioritize efficiently anymore because they are just so many who came , all whilst giving the bigots the opportunity to express their bigotry and possibly exposing innocent natives to terror attacks . 
  we handled it poorly . 
  i 'm : 1 ) not saying all of them are opportunists 2 ) all of them are criminals/terrorists 3 ) we should not help them etc. 
  i 'm saying we 've hampered the ability to help those truly in need and we 've exposed ourselves to unnecessary risk , both from possible terrorists and also gave populists weapons . 
  and we can improve our situation . 
  but not before people who supported the idea admit they were wrong . 
  we need true humility , not the fake one , if we 're honest about being the bigger man here . 
  look , it seems that you 've just constructed a strawman there . 
  free will does not negate the idea that societies are predictable , so free will or no free will , that has nothing to do with my point . 
  and , to clarify : you 're making a false assumption , which is that lack of free will implies fatalism . 
  it could also imply determinism , which is more in line with my personal belief . 
  not that it matters for the discussion , but it might be a worthwhile clarification on these philosophical concepts . 
  nah , i like the dutch . 
  they can be dickish , but i do n't hold that against them , it 's understandable . 
  i never said taking in refugees is bad . 
  my point was strictly about unlawful border crossings with no accountability and no control . 
  good intentions are a poor excuse for bad outcomes , at least where i live . 
  you say it 's a choice , i for one do n't believe in free will . 
  i think societies are very , very predictable and we have enough recorded history to know how a society will react to a phenomena . 
  personal choice or not and legalities aside , my point still stands : you ca n't put your foot into the lion 's mouth and hope for the better . 
  i think you 're under the wrong impression that you 've brought forth to me information and concepts i do n't have . 
  i was also never debating for a closed society/closed borders . 
  i do n't know where you got from . 
  when you put your foot in the lion 's mouth and he bites it off , it 's the lion who 's having a personal problem , not you creating a totally predictable situation and totally hoping for a miracle . 
  suit yourself . 
  you do n't want populists , well do n't give them weapons . 
  i was also pretty sure the law argument went out the window when the dublin agreement was officially ignored , but i 'm sure there 's some pointless , besides the point counter to that also . 
  oh , i 'm an idiot , i 'm sure that surprises no one . 
  well , i wo n't be grateful because i have n't benefited from that mentality , and even if that were the case , just because i stand to gain does n't mean you do n't stand to lose . 
  and that 's a disingenuous argument anyway , the most coldness and bigotry i 've ever faced came from dutch people . 
  but i get it , i understood why and was n't offended . 
  still , the dutch are n't the most welcoming people , so let 's be serious . 
  for your first point : you 're conflating different issues . 
  nobody said anything about letting them drown . 
  you came up with that , not me . 
  from fishing them out of the mediterranean sea ( which we had to because they knew we will do it , and thus most exploited our good intentions ) to letting them cross borders without any accountability , there 's a long way . 
  you 're argument is basically : `` i felt good doing it , so it is the right thing to do ! '',
