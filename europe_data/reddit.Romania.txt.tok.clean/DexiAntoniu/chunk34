  edit : oh , and btw , irrational behavior = / = mental illness . 
  that 's not what a mental illness is . 
  i called you a fatso , which is a low grade childish insult done in jest , with no moral judgement loaded whatsoever . 
  just to grab your attention . 
  you tried to paint me as against workers protection , completely out of your ass , just to hopefully discredit my argument , without actually discrediting it . 
  there 's no equivalence there . 
  you 've offered no counter arguments btw , you 've just restated the old arguments that i 've already nullified . 
  have a good day . 
  more people die because of obesity related issues . 
  telling people anorexia is not fine , ok , whatever . 
  why say this law is against *** `` unrealistic beauty standards '' *** then ? 
  * why ?? 
  * so it becomes clear what this law is actually about . 
  and what about fat people , to counter your argument ? 
  240 out of 1000 females are obese . 
  what are the costs on the public health system ? 
  how many pills ? 
  how many complications ? 
  how many doctor visits ? 
  how many shitty days because of the shitty mood ? 
  you do n't get to pick and choose which one to tackle between anorexia and obesity without getting criticized for the exclusivity , i 'm sorry . 
  especially so since obesity is a much larger issue by any metric . 
  sorry man , unless someone is force feeding you or denying you food , your eating disorder is fully your fault . 
  no one made you eat that cake . 
  no one made you not eat that cake . 
  you see yourself getting fat . 
  you feel yourself getting hungry . 
  the body tells you . 
  it 's your fault , barring mental issues and food unavailability . 
  you 're trying to paint me as against workers protection ? 
  lmao , that 's such a weak straw man . 
  you got any other arguments besides ad hominems ? 
  obesity is a bigger issue in france than anorexia is . 
  this legislation , which is self-described as *** against `` unrealistic '' bodies *** and not as models ' protection is ** discriminatory ** against certain subjective beauty standards . 
  the health concerns angle that you try to pull off is mooted by the fact that obesity is a much , much more dire issue and it did n't get similarly tackled . 
  more people are getting obese , less people are getting anorexic . 
  thus this legislation is not concerned with health issues or workers protection . 
  simple . 
  no , i understand their woes and i offer my help and support when that 's what has to be done , especially when my own consciousness would nag me otherwise , thus ** making it my responsibility ** . 
  but people with mental illness that can do nothing to better their own condition are indeed a statistical minority , and you could brush them up as an exception anyway . 
  i 'm not letting other people off hook just because there are people with mental issues . 
  that 's stupid as hell . 
  no it 's not . 
  because everything is possible only to a limited extent for everyone . 
  that 's not a point to factor in decision making and when choosing where to place responsibility . 
  it 's inconsequential . 
  it 's a point beyond dead . 
  since everything is limited to an extent , then there 's no point in making that distinction . 
  i 'm running out of ways to explain this . 
  thus , it does n't matter . 
  you take the responsibility you can take and you 'll be fine . 
  situations in which taking full personal responsibility is not enough are so rare it 's statistically irrelevant . 
  yeah , and 0.1 % of french women are anorexic , whilst 24 % of them are obese . 
  if we 're tackling public health , anorexia is not a priority . 
  it has everything to do with body acceptance by the discussions had in this comment section , there 's no clever evasion out of this , sorry . 
  people are offering the `` children think anorexia is normal because of models '' argument . 
  not the `` think of the poor models '' argument . 
  at least that 's the case by a huge margin . 
  so , don ' watch tv ? 
  learned helplessness is something i 'll never be on board with . 
  creating the american/european dichotomy is such a douchey and retarded thing to say ... suit yourself . 
  this is not fake , read up the comments . 
  the layers are created automatically by adobe . 
  there are no layers forgotten there by the alleged forger . 
  and numerama.com , since the layers are created automatically by adobe , not by the alleged forger . 
  not / s, 
  so because we 're european we should give up the notion of personal responsibility ? 
  what ? 
  listen fatso , 0.1 % of french women are anorexic . 
  24 % of them are obese . 
  playing off obese models as healthy is much more damaging than whatever anorexic models are doing . 
  in effect , telling fat people ( whose numbers are growing ) that it 's healthy to be fat is worse than whatever image anorexic women give ( considering that anorexia cases are going down ) . 
  0.1 % of french women suffer from anorexia . 
  around 24 % of them suffer from obesity . 
  by no means is anorexia is a bigger issue . 
  this is just another case of people fending for their feelings . 
  edit : of course , the classic downvotes and non-engagement ensue . 
  well , those are still the stats , deal with it . 
  there 's plenty of objectionable implications to globalism . 
  they 've quite recently made mainstream media believe that celebrities making the `` ok '' sign are part of a white supremacy conspiracy . 
  that 's at least indicative of one reason to care about pol ... 
  did i say that ? 
  why are you putting words in my mouth ? 
  not to mention that the original comment was , quite obviously , a joke . 
  i mean , it 's true , but it 's still written in humor . 
  globalisation has always been controversial . 
  this is not a debatable point . 
  google `` history of globalism '' or `` globalism controversy '' and go for the more reputable studies/articles . 
  this is not a discussion worth having on my part , i 'm sorry ... but have a nice day !, 
  funny thing is the globalists behind macron are quite visible lmao, 
  wtf i love varoufakis now, 
  not only that , but it 's not like canada is the country of sane politics either . 
  ca n't expect him to have a different opinion though , he lived his childhood through the last years of ceausescu and never got to see things getting better . 
  i hope it 's clear that not by my standards . 
  i ca n't care about this shit if you paid me ... 
  that 's only because we , the pro-eu , generally liberal individuals live in the bubble of our own politics . 
  macron is ' a flipflopper married to a woman older than him , thus not really a man , who seems to be content with the destruction of france via unsustainable immigration etc ' to the right . 
  that 's pretty offensive to them , pretty extreme . 
  how extreme something is depends on where you sit . 
  antifa in romania ?
