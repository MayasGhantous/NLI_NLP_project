  wow ... hardline communists ? 
  where do you people pull this crap ? 
  eeh , no ... all of antifa actually dress like that . 
  woah ... amazing ... you 're justifying setting people on fire based on a fundamentalist ideology surrounding nebulous `` opreshun '' . 
  not to mention that you have no proof that this individual policeman ever pepper sprayed anybody , in essence , thus , you 're promoting group punishment . 
  was n't this common logic less than a hundred years ago ? 
  you think you 're right to apply it because you certainly ca n't be wrong ? 
  amazing ... 
  absolutely amazing ... and frightening . 
  `` muh sovereignty '' is not a real issue when things are stable , and growing . 
  it 's an outlier issue . 
  `` muh sovereignty '' is an issue when *** a particular population seems to encounter issues in its society that could 've been avoided with increased sovereignty *** . 
  before the eu can federalize , it needs to come clean and solve at least some of the issues its institution and ideologies have created for individual national populations . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  do n't create issues which a nation 's people would 've avoided if they had the power to opt out . 
  currently , there are two fronts for this , like it or not : economy and immigration . 
  and i 'll leave it at that . 
  in other news , earth is round and spins around the sun . 
  the us alt-right do n't like what macron stands for , they do n't like the eu because of its insistence on promoting immigration ( to which there are legitimate objections ) and because they are insecure about the power of a federalized europe and how it could provide a successful model for post-national geopolitical entities ( which is what actually makes them insecure ) . 
  the international alt-right and the american one see eye to eye on the issue of demographic uncertainty of european nations and the solutions of not-so-honest politicians ( like hillary clinton ) navigating their careers on the money of supranational/global entities , especially solutions such as mass immigration . 
  russia hardly plays a role in the group mentality of the alt-right . 
  the russia narrative is what those under attack by the alt-right have opted to present to the laypersons in their effort to paint a negative picture of the alt-right . 
  why is this important to understand ? 
  because there 's nothing honest in this surface narrative . 
  if we want people to come to a simple understanding ( there is no future for europe in division ) , we need to put forth honest arguments and expose ourselves to the criticism of those opposing us , to see where they might be right . 
  ideological purity , false narratives and demonization of critics will be what kills the sane left and the eu , not the alt-right . 
  drunk . 
  hackerpimp . 
  drugs just are n't a thing here . 
  hoes , that 's our thing . 
  how dare you ?? 
  i am enraged with offense arghh, 
  asian fundamentalists of an undetermined abrahamic faith . 
  stop being hypocrites , for starters . 
   romania is culturally closer to iraq than western europe . 
  why do you think this sub is full of far right wing and anti muslim comments from eastern europeans ? 
  they have no clue about western culture and are still stuck in some backwards culture . 
  honestly , that last people we need in western europe are some romanian far right wing idiots that are more conservative and racist than the generation of our grandparents . 
  no thanks . 
  you do realize that you just said you do n't want muslims in your western europe , right ? 
  so you just called me a racist , and somewhat that disproves my assertion ? 
  omg lol ... 
  wow ... 
  that 's hilarious . 
  i 'd be wary of them because they disagree , because i 'd treat them as independent thinking people and that 's what they 'd choose to defend . 
  the `` call him names '' tactic wo n't stick on me . 
  ca n't work every time , especially when you 're wrong . 
  try explaining that to people in this sub . 
  when i do it , i 'm `` racist '' . 
  i have n't said a word about religion . 
  you 're projecting and clearly not interested in having an honest discussion . 
  that 's false . 
  why ? 
  because there are higher level and lower level moral principles . 
  lower level moral principles ( acted out as cultural symbols or social behaviors ) are overseen by higher level moral principles . 
  you can not compare the utility of lower level moral principles with higher level moral principles . 
  the burka is *** a lower level moral principle acted out as both a social behavior and a cultural symbol that is antithetical to the higher level moral principle of western egalitarianism *** because it stems from a different value system . 
  the lower level moral principle of ** you can dress however you like to properly express what you believe ** is governed by the higher level moral principle/s of *** tolerance and intrinsic moral equality between all people *** . 
  the burka , because of its place of origin , is governed by a different higher level moral principle , which i will not describe to not annoy more people than i already have . 
  it 's illogical to even introduce the burka in the moral discussions of our value axioms , that 's why this discussion never ends . 
  you 're arguing for the virtue of an orange in opposition with that of a carrot , because the principle of the carrot is governed by `` all vegetables have equal vegetable dignity '' . 
  it 's the best way i can describe this phenomena atm . 
  it sounds pretty stupid , but i 'll work on this argument lol, 
  you 're wrong ( well , not really ) . 
  the point is that they are not human . 
  you ca n't have basic human interaction with something that is not human , but traditionally a commodity . 
  a product of which you can buy as many as your wallet allows . 
  that 's what the burka is for . 
  `` we should let women choose if they can wear the symbol of their inability to choose , the thing that sets them apart from real humans ( men ) which can choose '' . 
  there 's no choice . 
  i would honestly be weary of women whom , when in isolation and complete safety , defend their burka . 
  my grandfather told of how incredibly hot the temperatures could reach , and how the poor women were fully covered in the thickest black textile available in the region , how they would carry water , food , do chores , whilst they - the romanian men - were barely coping working bare-bust . 
  the burka is such an insult to human decency , i can only imagine some people defend it out of some misplaced sense of kindness and tolerance , having never been confronted with true malevolence and unjust suffering . 
  or out of nihilism , i imagine . 
  my grandfather used to work in libya and iraq during ceausescu 's regime . 
  he was in construction , romania sent colonies of workers to build stuff in the communist arab countries . 
  he 's seen stuff . 
  he told me how the men 's incentive towards financial gain was * buying wives * . 
  plural . 
  women were commodities . 
  they veiled them because `` it 's my property and i do n't want it to be used in any way by any other person '' . 
  communism , however despicable , had worked towards secularizing these aspects of the respective societies , and achieved mild but sizable changes . 
  you want to keep the burka ? 
  fine . 
  read the comment again . 
  this is what it represents . 
  it 's not a cultural expression compatible with eu culture . 
  it 's antithetical . 
  do you think isis needs `` legitimizing '' ? 
  you think they are only halfheartedly decapitating prisoners and enslaving women ? 
  you think any moderate , integrated muslims will go `` alright , time to join isis '' if the law passes ? 
  or do you think they will be relieved ? 
  yeah , threaten and/or guilt a big group of people holistically , then watch them become the holistic group and respond to threats with the hostility that threats bring about . 
  and for what ? 
  these sorts of things are clearly political moves , they do n't come from the care and love said politicians have for the poles ( or generally speaking the threatened group ) or the bigger , moral picture ( the strength of the eu ) . 
  they just think people are too stupid to see through it , and they 're not , and that only compounds their hostility towards and their strengthening against the common threat . 
  it 's just so pathetic . 
  in all likelihood , the orban type is n't the way forward for the eu . 
  clearly not le pen . 
  but neither is this sort of politics and politicians , such as macron .
