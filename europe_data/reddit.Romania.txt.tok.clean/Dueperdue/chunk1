great reply . 
  except the fact nvidia did n't gave cancer to no one ... ( yet ) . 
  do you realize that from today on `` german engineering '' will be used as a catch-phrase for cheating/law-quality ? 
  the feeling that `` made in germany '' is actually superior is now gone . 
  thank god , someone with a brain . 
   if we want to behave like civilized people what if one would only want to not see his country trashed in 1-2 years time ? 
  damn , i thought i understood you right . 
  i am for restricting this shit to 0 % . 
  australia seems a nice country . 
  wait till one of them rapes a german . 
  then you 'll see the turnaround . 
  well , we do have awesome internet though ... 
  well , that would sell/convince as much , would it ? 
  well , that did n't take long at all . 
  not his fault if the world is fucked . 
  so what you 're saying is : survival of the fittest . 
  fine by me . 
  i agree with this comment entirely . 
  of course italy likes hilary . 
  fucking italians i ca n't wait to exit this disgusting country ( for the people , the country itself is fine ), 
  he 's jewish , who gives a fuck . 
  statistically pessimists have a higher change of being right than optimists . 
  `` this stuff sounds bad , so it must be false '', 
   us officials successfully used the prospect of ttip to bully the eu into abandoning plans to ban 31 dangerous pesticides with ingredients that have been shown to cause cancer and infertility . 
  how nice . 
  the tpp/ttip regulation is ** literally ** cancer . 
  \\ #justromanianthings now , where are we with berlusconi ? 
  thank god . 
  that moment when i make 22k ... 
  i am actually interested in the excuses you can come up with . 
  go on . 
  `` the rich '' being on reddit equals being rich ? 
  so ... how come they are so dumb to believe everything they hear about germany being this utopia ? 
  i smell a lot of confirmation bias in here ... plus , they have cell phones but are n't capable of googling for themselfs to see what 's the real status of germany 's economy ? 
  oh , they will surely be intelligent enough to add to the german gene pool ... 
  i bet . 
   everyone is getting richer please , tell me you are high or something , you ca n't be this indoctrinated . 
  numerous studies have shown that the more we go on the richer the rich become while the poorer the poor/middleclass get . 
  by 2030 there will probably be no more `` middle class '' at all , having only poor and rich , unless we start decapitating someone . 
  i am not advocating that everyone should have the same things regardless of contribution . 
  i am speaking about a democratic socialist system . 
  what kind of reasoning is that ? 
  with what the top 1 % makes you could make everyone on this earth live comfortably . 
  the theory that `` we are so many that the wealth would be too diluted '' is just nonsense . 
  second : i would prefer all to live a comfortable life than a few who swim in gold and piss silver . 
  now imagine what will happen if the tpp passes . 
  an international organization can make laws that say to the local country laws `` fuck you '' . 
  and who will this organization protect ? 
  the citizens , of course !, 
  yeah , capitalism sure is working wonderfully , with the 0.1 % of the world owning 81 % of the world 's wealth . 
  i am sure that those * poor * ceos work 21312414124 % more than your average employee ... 
  why should it be ? 
  on the contrary : i expect more countries to adopt it . 
  yep , i confirm you are italian by the lack of arguments in your comment . 
  i am still amazed you know english , since most italians do n't . 
  the answers to this thread are disgusting . 
  no wonder we are so fucked up . 
  how can any agreement that stands to limit freedom be `` ok '' with the general population ? 
  has any commenter read the wikileaks documents ? 
   italy and italians disgust me i take that back . 
  only italians disgust me , italy is actually a nice country . 
  i am not even surprised . 
  not even italians like their food . 
  you want to know what italians eat ? 
  pasta , pasta , pasta ... did i say pasta ? 
  the majority of the time with tomato sauce . 
  when they buy meat , they buy 30g of 5 different types of meat ( making me wait 1000 years for them to get a total of 150g of fucking meat ) . 
  when they put `` parmigiano '' ( cheese ) on the pasta , it 's only 2-3 little spoons , carefully measured . 
  of course , not every single italian does this , but the majority does . 
  in public you see them with iphones , you see them at clubs , on vacations ... but try to eat with them in the day-by-day ... it 's fucking embarrassing . 
  i was born in romania , now living in italy 10 years . 
  italy and italians disgust me . 
  their pizza is so shitty that most prefer going to places that sell kebab , which usually also make pizza . 
  trying to get `` full '' on their pizza is like finding a virgin : mission impossible . 
  you would n't fucking believe how thin is their pizza . 
  you ca n't even keep the slice in your hand because the bread i basically 1 mm and everything falls apart . 
  i was considering moving to germany , but now with this refugee crisis i have no idea where to go . 
  nice to see taxpayers money put to good use . 
  why no china ? 
  they are not capable of cooking , chief . 
   here is ~ ~ 1 cow , 2 pig . ~ ~ 4 goats ftfy, 
  damn you and your sin bullshit . 
  if there was a god , i am pretty sure he gives no fucks on what you fucking eat . 
  so ... stupid question : i go to amazon.de and it 's still in german . 
  how do i change it in english ? 
  still a better ~ ~ love story ~ ~ citizen than ~ ~ twilight ~ ~ a `` refugee '' . 
  thanks for the comment . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
   yeah that 's stupid . 
  but that 's culture so ... according to this reasoning , if my culture says i am to fuck goats and butcher females under 10 , that would be fine ? 
  and do you realize they never `` adapt '' to the culture of the country where they intend to live ? 
  they , on the contrary , try to impose their bullshit `` culture '' onto us . 
   post that makes the ** innocent ** * refugees * seem less like the bad guys ehm , they are the bad guys . 
  you are free to post the marvelous things refugees have done so far ... 
  found the `` refugee '' . 
  because of course your non-existing got requires a special place to worship him ... jesus i hate religion . 
  about to be . 
  i am so happy . 
  fuck the british . 
  i am so glad they left .
