a mortal killed the gods of olympus and set chaos onto the old world order . 
  though , if i were to guess , a lot of us were spread thin in europe , nothing precise as a nation or country . 
  just small-scale settlements . 
  however , i 'd bet that it did n't took long before even the morons of the groups realised that it 's better to form bigger groups with people along the way . 
  gang mentality , to be more precise . 
  then ... we remembered how to make fire , make a wheel or two , and forge the first blade . 
  no , self-harming idiocracy . 
  it 's cynically hilarious that the current-induced perception is `` all romanians are thieves '' but `` all foreigners are honest & fair '' . 
  one day ... 
  welcome to the club !, 
  if only our representatives would add '' ... but we wo n't guarantee for their lives '' . 
  that 'd be sweet . 
  do n't talk in their name , they 've sent their message clear and high . 
  we should n't have helped you in ww2 with the evacuations . 
  at least in that scenario , you 'd call it an even . 
   having actual jobs and money is less important than the nationality of those that give them . 
  let 's see : economic blackmail , extorsion , inequitable wages , lobbying , never to betray its country/countries of origins ... yeah , i might forget two or three points but , here they are . 
   we should all become an autarky while we 're at it . 
  an autarky in an isolationist sensed spectrum ? 
  the type of nation that would survive on this would require to control three quarters of this planet . 
  semi-autarky in a free market , laissez-faire ( both with foreign & our own autochthonous enterprises , industries , corporations , multinational corporations , financial giants & commerce ) sensed spectrum ? 
  yes . 
  * i * am a minarchist and a capitalist . 
  although no country would survive on it , * autarky * is the only measure that decides a nation 's capabilities in face of danger , conflicts , wars or world wars : how much would it resist on its own . 
  so yes , autarkic principles have their value and merit when discussing it . 
  of course , xenophiliacs & xenocentrics do n't know what loyalty & self-conservation is ( i 'm sure * you * do n't ; unless it 's in the service of * others * ) , but i 'm going off-topic with this little part . 
  * btw , keep this in mind : globalization * *** is *** * autarky . 
  the winner ( country and its citizens ) will be the one which its bussinessmen control most or all of the bussinesses on the planet . 
  that 's power . 
  sadly , most of my conationals , frostxtq included , due to their xenophilia and xenocentrism , do not or can not fathom this . 
  this is why romania will never advance more than what it is . 
  the same ones you , and others like you , ought to be taking : getting one 's head out of the ass & start paying attention for the prime axiom that jobs are n't more important than those who [ own the enterprises and ] gives them to you . 
  ~ ~ that our `` economic banana republic '' model , the * lend-leased territory economy * , is on life support ... ~ ~ but i suppose i 'd be asking too much of all of you . 
   lots of countries have lifted themselves out of poverty thanks to foreign investments ( too ) . 
  yes , our own kapital , our own autochthonous industries , corporations , multinationals & financial giants have coverage all over the globe in multiple countries . 
  / s keyword : * autochthonous *  there 's nothing wrong about them . 
  the third one is my favorite since it specifies what 's wrong with favoring others over your own . 
  of course , you 'll have trouble understanding this . 
   you 're just being a child . 
  this `` child '' does n't pick strawberries , nor cleans the feces from old peoples ' asses in a home care , nor working as a shop clerk ; for a great living , dignity included . 
   jobs are jobs , * no matter if your boss is italian * or romanian . 
  another illiterate spewing the same economical nonsense . 
  alas n ' sadly , when your boss calls you to heel for the porte , your xenophilia and xenocentrism leaves much to be desired . 
  it could go 69 % for all we 'd wish , if it 's foreign based , then this lend-leased territory economy is on artificial life support . 
  remember global warming ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
  * today , over where i 'm at , was sunny-ish & cold . 
   okay first , i was talking about the bucharest sectors , sorry for that . 
  i wrote * capital * with a ` k ' for a reason you know . 
  a subtle ` fuck you ' , huh ? 
  remember to never run and slip over your keys from your pocket . 
  very painful . 
   but secondly , who owns the company literally does n't matter . 
  it actually matters who [ owns ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-legacy-iduskcn0pq17z20150716 ) it . 
  only an illiterate in economics would support otherwise , all things concerned . 
  the term economic blackmail/extorsion exists for dozens of reasons ; one of them involves relocalisation and ownership . 
   have the years living under pseudo-boyars not proved that ? 
  you 've lost me , `` pseudo-boyars '' ? 
  use a dictionary . 
   being screwed by one of your own is just as bad , and he can do it better because he 's mates with the mayor and the inspectors . 
  foreign dependencies are worse than vices within an industry . 
  china , for example , may appear as the second-in-command on the world stage , however , how much of its industry is genuine , autochthonous , `` made in china '' ? 
  yes , yes , yes , they manufacture and produce most of our goods , but under what guise does their products appear on our shelves ? 
  * ( it 's a rhetorical question ) * for example , the majority of apple 's iphones are produced by the chinese , with the * made in china * imprinted on it , however , the biggest afferent piece of the pie returns to apple . 
  what is apple ? 
  an american multinational , owned by a mojority of americans , with their base/main headquarters in the us . 
  if what you 've told me is true , that `` who owns the company literally does n't matter '' is correct , then i suppose this was merely a [ flick ] ( http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2423066,00.asp ) ... correct ? 
  or that economic blackmail/extorsion - as i 've linked two sources previously - is just a. . . fearmongering , no ? 
   and the final owner and overseer of it all is still the government , which ultimately is elected by the romanian people . 
  did you know that renault received money from my government * just * to not leave for morroco ? 
  imagine all those people working there * - poof - * suddenly unemployed because renault decided so , if they were n't paid . 
  * that * is economic power , influence & domination ; all of it at the fingertips of a bunch of executives from two distinct countries that would never dare to turn their backs on their countries of origin . 
  do n't get me started on wage inequity ...  they might blackmail it through jobs , but atleast they pay better and they 're not in the same social circles as the people you elect . 
  i was wondering when i was going to hear the same slogan : `` all romanians are corrupt , but all foreigners are honest , angelic and pure crystal clear '' . 
  - as the italian say . 
   and they need local companies to do the multitude of small things contractors are supposed to do , and again they wo n't chose who they went to high school with . 
  ah , since you 've mentioned , subcontractors are the reason why we do n't have promised highways . 
  thank thee honest foreigner !, 
   to think that a local aristocracy is somehow better because it speaks your language is another step to blind orbanism and a return to a type of bureaucratic feudalism . 
  uh-huh , when foreigners own their own economic sectors ( industries , corporations , multinationals , financial institutions , commerce etcetera ) , they 're cool and good . 
  but if * we * would like to have our own autochthonous economic sector , we 're not good and ` corrupt ' . 
  yeah , the market liberalisation has shown that , when we 've put trust into foreigners to help get our * own * economy back on tracks . 
  instead , they'e taken advantage on the fragile socio-economic situation , bribed , and bankrupted everything we 've got . 
  food for thought , which ones are the scumbags of the earth ? 
  a ) the ones accepting the bribe ( officials , as teh narrative has it ) * or * b ) the ones initiating the bribe in the first place ( foreigners ; one example being the [ microsoft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microsoft_licensing_corruption_scandal ) case ) let alone engaging in economic blackmail/extorsion , unequitable wages and so on ? 
  do n't rush . 
  btw , the hungarians are attaway , if you have something to talk about , blgh , `` orbanism '' .

  have an unnerving read and ... remember ... if you slip , do n't fall over your keys in your pocket ; it 'd be painful . 
  who says it was n't spoiled before her appearance in local politics ? 
  the romanian economic/market kapital has been slowly decapitated in favor of external ones , with some help from the inside . 
  the french woman will be a more obvious , out in the open , about the whole situation . 
  * i just argued with [ someone ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gbit6/japanese_stereotypes_of_european_countries_based/d2gomps?context=3 ) what 's genuine economic power . 
  whether it 's a local or an odd one ( like her ) , it is n't a big difference ; if any . 
  if she 'll be elected by xenophiles and xenocentrics , then yeah , they 'll deserve her . 
  she has some dubious backstory when some privatisations were done by french companies . 
   dacia foreign , bought by french giant renault . 
  not autochthonous . 
   continental foreign , company with origins and headquarters in germany . 
  not autochthonous .
