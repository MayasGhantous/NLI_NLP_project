  change the word , use `` amalgamated '' . 
   romanian expats do n't all live in the same area where they form a majority . 
  it does n't have to in order to prove my point . 
  just a majority in a certain area and there you go : hillbilly provincialist tribalism . 
  or 50 % + 1 , just to be cynical . 
   next you 're going to say that other distinct historical and cultural regions do n't actually exist and that they 've never existed : banat , transylvania , wallachia , moldavia , \u021aara mo\u021bilor , \u021aara oa\u0219ului , etc. 
  are those nonexistent as well ? 
  of course , * de facto * , they existed in the past and now , in the present , they exist * de jure * . 
  i mean , look how our president was elected : provincialism + the positive stereotype that he 's german . 
  ai n't that a sight for sore eyes : democracy downgraded into that . 
  well ... the old geezer did wanted us to develop a `` unique democracy '' . 
   or do you think things only exist after they 've been * sanctioned * by the state ? 
  i think you meant to use another word than that one . 
  do you even know what that word means ? 
  'cause it does n't mean what you think it means in the context you 've written it . 
  here 's and adjective to use in the future and not mock yourself over lack of words to use : amalgamation . 
  `` sanctioned '' ... whoever reads that word either thinks the unionism happened at gunpoint or that you 're a nitwit that does n't know how , what & when to put words into context . 
  i mean it , ** change that goddamn word with ** *** ` amalgamated ' *** . 
  haralambie ... 
  nice , attacking your fellow romanian conational . 
  i bet you could n't have slept well , tonight , without commenting against me . 
  by that logic , romanian expats form their own `` tinut romanesc '' wherever they live in europe . 
  ca n't you see it 's bullshit ? 
  yet , i digress , `` tell a lie often ... '', 
  do n't sweat it . 
  the whole situation about this invisible entity is idiocracy mixed with hillbilly provincialist tribalism . 
  `` tell a lie often and it will become the truth . '', 
  there never was a `` szekely land/country '' ever recorded in history . 
  culturally & traditionally , they imitate their ` cousins ' . 
  unofficial name , by all means ... 
  you do n't know how a highway works , i get it child , you 've never seen one . 
  alternative title : * corruption rife in the netherlands , as the justice system leaves a lot to be desired . 
  criminals , thieves & undesirables are walking among you . 
  as if that 'll solve anything ... ** we need highways !!!!!!!, 
  not with france and germany at the helm . 
  you 're outside the loop . 
   everybody you misspelled france and germany . 
   sweats nervously esti porc ? 
  the purpose of cutting taxes is to get as many able to pay them , while not making taxes a burden and unpayable . 
  fascism is another form of leftwing ideology . 
  the pretext of affording it must n't rhyme with turning the medical staff into your underpaid slaves * just because * . 
   by japan and germany why ? 
  your xenocentrism wo n't solve global matters . 
  health is an investment , not a vacantion trip . 
  bush accepted * us * in nato when france & germany , from kilometres away in safety , were appeasing russia regarding nato expansion . 
   republicans in general maybe . 
  senate + hor majority . 
   trump is no republican though . 
  rockefeller republican . 
   and he said repeatedly that he will not help defend eastern europe . 
  have you ever heard of * demagoguery * ? 
  republicans are better friends to us than democrats . 
  remove the `` z '' . 
  i 'm curious , swiss jokes about austrians ? 
   but greeks trusted goldman sachs ... did greeks knew what their politicians have done ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   spot the difference . 
  keep it to yourself . 
   no need to get so defensive anyway , it was probably just a joke . 
  it was n't . 
  the whole romanian-roma-rroma ( gypsy ) fiasco , since the 90s to the present , wo n't make any of us more content . 
  not all of us romanians forgive and forget , nor all of us are xenophiles . 
   also i spotted your legitimate discrimination against autists . 
  bad boy . 
  autists are n't a separate social category , from venus or mars . 
  a dangerous disorder . 
  i 've seen my share , i know what i 'm talking about . 
   also he 's norwegian and not even number one for them . 
  good for him for false impersonation ( it 's easy anyway ) . 
  if i start talking about his barnevernet , the discussion ends there . 
  i think we won . 
  no , we do n't have such category here , as far as i know . 
  not even for generations born after 2000 or 2010 ( unless it 's a ridiculous , hideous , copy-paste of the word from english ) . 
  the only category , that every romanian will know , are only the * postdecembrists * ( generations born after 1989 ) or * postdecembrist kid/teenager * , though used rarely since they 've grown up . 
  what the hell is a millennial ? 
  postdecembrists ? 
  your xenophilia has gotten so worse that you 're saying `` please '' . 
  more so , you did n't justified more due to financial causes , but for * shame * that you 're not following the so-called trend of leaving home as early as possible . 
  your mindset is awful , not for the effect ( s ) , but for the cause ( s ) . 
  if the black cat will cross the road in front of you , or if you will meet a priest on the road , then you will have bad luck unstable pussies and grim reapers look-alikes are a bad omen even if you 're not into occultism or reading the daily horoscope . 
  if your palm is itching it means that you will either receive some money or you will get beaten no , the money part is for when your beard ( even if you do n't have one , just above the goiter/neck/goitre or just the jaw ) itches , it 'll mean you 'll receive ( it 's `` receive '' , not `` earn '' ; just an observation ) money . 
  getting your ass handed to you , i do n't know that . 
  if it rains at your wedding it means you will have a happy marriage and traffic jam . 
  never give the last cigarette from your pack because this means giving away your wife wooooooo - who 's supposed to be the sucker here ? 
  if you stay in the corner of the table , you will never get married if idiots , somehow , got their dicks impaled , that 's on them . 
  if you spill water on the floor , never wash it with your foot do wet socks count ? 
  if a painting will fall from a wall , it means a close friend or a relative will die very soon 1977 kids will know this one . 
  if you leave leftovers in your plate then you will marry an ugly wife/husband ah , vanity and aesthetics . 
  when you sew a cloth that you are wearing you need to have a small piece of thread in your mouth , or else you will sew your mind eat your heart out , confucius . 
  crying at your wedding brings good luck crying ; not honking your cars through the traffic . 
  newbies take notes . 
  breaking a glass will banish the bad luck \u038f\u03c0\u03b1 !, 
  baby 's nails should never be cut until the age of one , or else he will become a thief surely this does n't have anything to do with breastfeeding ? 
  i wonder ...  \\ 27 . 
  never get married in may , or else your marriage will be blown away like the leaves of the trees you ca n't make this shit up without any form of stimulents . 
  you ca n't , yet , * we * beat all odds reality throws at us . 
  if you have your mouth opened while conceiving your baby , you will give birth to a girl ... 
  assuming it 's about the wife , what if her opened mouth is a form of assurance you 're doing a good/great job at * it * ? 
  if 13 people stay at one table , then one of them will surely die before the end of the year may the odds be ever in our favour and god help us helping ourselves . 
  if guests at your wedding talk about marriage after the sunset , then the groom will cheat the bride why , is n't that supposed to be `` the happiest day of her life '' ?
