  uhuhuhuh , tell me ` bout it . 
  hey , what not rub it with crooked privatisations , that always boils the blood up the brain . 
  thanks . 
  commercial travelling , second-hand & importing are n't genuine businesses . 
  we 've been taught that , since they 've created prefabricates and * muh roadz * , they were progressive . 
  however , i do agree to an extent : prolonged debauchery tends to downgrade quality & a forced reformatting is in order to restabilise nominal function . 
  alas , in my case , i 'm being seduced back into protochronism , dacology , thracology . 
   it 's ominous . 
  duh , it 's a torture-to-death tool . 
  it needs a massive overhaul . 
   well , i think that as a whole , romanians want to be treated fairly in order to be treaed fair , not `` fairly '' , we had to have an economic , autochthonous , powerbase . 
  do we have that , besides offshores and foreign-owned companies/multinationals ? 
  no , of course we do n't . 
  so , what fair treatment , or `` fairly '' , do you and others like you smoke on about ? 
   romanian business-people we do n't have those anymore . 
   he said there was reason to believe that in the event of war , the notes were intended for circulation in areas that could possibly be captured , including denmark , the netherlands and west germany . 
  now that 's a shred of mad optimism right there : winning a cold war with nukes . 
  christ ...  emblazoned with the skylines of several polish cities , the notes range in value from one to 2,000 zloty and will be on public display at the national mint in warsaw as of next year . 
  why not sell them as collectibles ? 
  they 're not any different than commemorative coins . 
  unless ... poland does still think these can be used ... as they were meant to be ... oooooh , * naughty , naughty polska * . 
   yet easterners are totally different in this regard , right ? 
  in absolute advantage terms , foolproof ? 
  can do that . 
  in relative/comparative advantage terms ? 
  yes . 
   who cares what the french do , your country still pretends the problem does n't exist and just wants other countries to take care of it . 
  one problem , * federalista * : in every possibile way , ** they 're not romanian ** . 
  they are * not * ours , it 's that simple & uncomplicated . 
  *** your problem *** , on the other hand , is continuing to adhere that , somehow , they are us . 
  sadly , you & others like you , are wrong beyond measure : gypsies are not ethnic romanians nor do they have anything to do with romania . 
  they are n't different , as status , than migrants coming from the middle east . 
  the difference is that communism entrenched them here , with force , without giving them the possiblity to move out . 
  i can only tolerate these malicious mishaps blamed on us for so long . 
  they 're not us . 
  the minority rights rhetoric only pursued this further than it already is : they 're not romanians , they 're a minority . 
  i can assure you it 's like i say it is . 
  now go cry me a river that `` it 's your problem , not ours '' . 
  going back against your own advice 20 years ago , when we were barely out of communism , and conditioning us to strip our industry away . 
   as i said , spain integrated them so it can be done , stop with the excuses no , * federalista * , you wrote :   spain integrated them , it obviously was n't a complete success that does n't mean success . 
  that sounds more like a failure . 
  a task can either end in a success or failure ; or , to put it militarily , either a `` strategic success '' or a `` strategic failure '' . 
  which one is it , huh ? 
  it 's either a success or a failure . 
  * a little observation . 
  * how is it that countries which lectured us , on our own turf , about tolerance of their ill-gotten mentality , when they are trying their best to extradite them , since 2010 , and evacuate them ? 
  i 'm thinking of france and sweden , they were among the countries to lecture us * - as if we did n't know with what we were dealing and still do - * about what do to with them , that now decide to go against their own advices , and extradite them ? 
  the americans have a saying to this arrogant , insolent , hypocrisy : * `` put your money where your mouth is [ before preaching shit ] '' * . 
  apparently , suddenly , you forgot your own lectures and blame everything on us . 
  is n't that joyful !, 
  he 's correctly justified . 
  and so am i & other romanians outraged by this perception propagated by tabloids and mass-media . 
  but it also shows off the ... * capabilities * of westerners to process an information whether it 's true or false ... but that 's a different topic to discuss . 
  huh ? 
  what does your suggestion mean anything to what he wrote ? 
  you drunk on maple syrup ? 
  putting stereotypes aside , i heard rumours , i 'm not asking ostentatiously . 
  get sober and come back later . 
  you just proved my point ... and you did n't realize it when you posted this ?!, 
  by your standards , the guilty party is n't the one who started the whole bribery to get favoritism , but those which accepted it . 
  that 's your problem with perception : you 're not blaming the foreign factor that initiated the bribery . 
  but that 'd be blasphemous to * ^ gasp * blame a foreigner , is it ? 
  btw , in usa , ww pays the american consumer . 
  in europe , they give it the middle finger . 
  choke on it ( you know what ) .
