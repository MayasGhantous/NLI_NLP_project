  yay for foreign-owned companies !, 
  those foreigners sure are n't corrupt and bribe themselves to get favoritisms . 
  better than the internationalist-communist way of life that plagued our nations for 45 years . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  * `` romanian '' . 
  and do n't forget about his friends . 
  what a `` romanian '' . 
  niste xenofili internationalisti batuti in cap , asta sunteti . 
  let me debunk some know-it-alls that replied you , given the 9 minute limit / per comment . 
  u/rapzeh writes :   as a romanian in italy , i can tell you it 's the same nationalistic based hatred of your neighbour that italians have for the french . 
  nothing serious and 99 % of the population could n't give a damn ... its a bit like football fans/ultra rivalry . 
  now , you see u/rinasciment , *** the very first problem *** here is exactly his self-denunciation as introduction : * `` as a romanian in italy '' * . 
  notice how he presented himself , he did n't wrote * `` i 'm a romanian [ living ] in italy '' * , no , instead he used the * `` as a. . . '' * idiomatic belittled self-introduction , which was invented on the internet . 
  notice how he belittles being `` a romanian '' , as if that 's a curse yet , obviously , he feels shame for the wreckage the gypsies have done in the west in our name . 
  you can ask any professor that specializes in grammar and/or linguistics as whole that this type of writing represents feebleness , uncertainty , and humility . 
  i 'd recommend to not take seriously , or any consideration , what these types of comments from these judases , and stay away from their information . 
  i know what you might think , conational vs `` conational '' , it sounds & looks horrible , but it 's harshly justified . 
  let me explain ... 
  they , the romanian expats like u/rapzeh , do not represent the nation , they 've started to become strangers to their own language , and they 're the type of expats that would gladly sell their nation '' * just for the heck of it * '' . 
  english people call this `` self-loathe '' . 
  they 're judases , they have no more connection with the country whatsoever , other than presenting their unimportant , unrealistic , answers , kilometres away from what happens in the country . 
  a romanian living in italy or france or anywhere else , is n't interested what happens to his/her country of origin , others than presenting stupid , delusional , self-harming , cliches & humility . 
  so , i do advise you , stay away from expats and their biased opinions , they have no more connections to their former - or , shall i say * ex * - country of origin . 
  they 're cowards , with a concentrated dosage of hypocrisy and insolence . 
  it 's deplorable . 
  *** the second problem *** is what he describes as a petty rivalry , as in :   it 's the same nationalistic based hatred of your neighbour that italians have for the french . 
  sadly , since he does n't have any connection with the country ( he does n't give a damn , like the rest of the expats ) , he could n't be further from the truth . 
  this is not a simple rivalry , like the impression he likes to give . 
  i know history and the consequences between the * four of you * ( italians , french , english/british & spanish ) , however , it pales in comparison the way he wrote about it , about us the hungarians . 
  it 's far more concentrated . 
  combine that with the region , the carpathians-balkans , and you 're quick to realize this is beyond petty rivalry . 
  it 's not at the same level like the israelis and palestinians , but it definetly is n't lower than * `` same nationalistic based hatred of your neighbour '' * as he 's written . 
  if you really want to know how much a romanian expat knows , ask about the romanian presence living in the region the hungarians like to call `` the zekely land '' or whatever . 
  it 's an invisible confrontation , and u/rapzeh does n't know a damn thing . 
  again , ignore expats and make sure they 're not expats . 
  and see for yourself how much the * `` nothing serious and 99 % of the population could n't give a damn ... its a bit like football fans/ultra rivalry '' * holds ground . 
  i can tell you , it does n't , the way he presents it . 
  ----- u/peoplehelper writes :   not really . 
  there are some extremists on both sides , but i think that we are good neighbors . 
  of course , if he was interested , he would n't have ever forget about the active fidesz , jobbik and hvim ostentanious , anti-romanian , activities . 
  if he would , he would 've said more than `` i think that we are good neighbors '' . 
  ----- *** my answer . 
  *** sadly , as surprising as it would seem , it 's *** not us *** that causes these active problems . 
  the hungarian authorities act like terrorists , the majority hungarians ( which are horthyists and irredentists ) behave no better , and they 're active in their anti-romanian rhetoric and propaganda . 
  just look at this , when brexit has n't even started : http://brexit.language-rights.eu/ do you know who made that and posted them in netherlands ? 
  a hungarian . 
  yet u/rapzeh , u/peoplehelper & other like them forgot , because ... why not be angry of your neighbour who 's actively charging anti-you against your interests ? 
  oh , of course , they 're expats , they forget everything . 
  cheers !, 
  uh-huh , because we all know that facebook represents the undeniable proof for loyalty and unmasking double-faced pricks that want to harm us in our own field . 
  * #logic #hipstersarecancernmustdie *, 
   szanto   does n't seem very hungarian to me oooohh , pardon , they should be called lazlo , attila or bela , so that * you * can be 100 % convinced they 're hungarian . 
  of-fuckin-course !, 
  the romanian , humile , obliviousness that does n't want to ever fight if need be . 
   that depends on your knowledge of them generalized , like any other non-british , unless there are some inside secrets known only among yourselves . 
   in a globalized world , that 's close to impossible . 
  and with your state of mind , you may as well forget about it . 
  says the german . 
  you 're only lucky that harry dexter 's plan was n't continued after 1949-1953 , otherwise , you would 've herded flocks of sheep at this very moment . 
  only by a whim , do you still hold onto autochthonous industries . 
  yet , to us , we had to strip ours just to please a bunch of hypocrites . 
  unforgivable , unforgettable . 
   to be competitive , you need all the talent you can get - home grown , migrants , returning expats ... no , by initiating several pushes , like the ttip , and see things devolve . 
  the rest can fade away for their hypocritical betrayal . 
   only if by clear-conscienced you mean `` agrees with me '' . 
  t\u00e2rgu mure\u015f is still fresh , not counting ip & tr\u0103znea . 
  interestingly , on the former , the foreign mass-media have been doing the same defamation against us in their favour . 
  but i guess that 's history . 
   which was most likely trying to make 1k euros like a couple of dumb fucks or like a bunch of irredentist horthyists . 
   what nation would that be ? 
  the only flag i would fly is the romanian one . 
    * brit * in ro * that * one . 
   aww , ebadd does n't care for my opinion ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  instead , i 'm keen in hearing your opinions & talk about northern ireland , opium & china , the boers , the raj ... after all , you might know more than me in those cases . 
  do n't ya ? 
   anywho , this imo is the uk 's problem more than ours , we 're just gon na be the ones cleaning it up . 
  what are you blabbering ? 
   ok , so you do n't like examples of ( actual ) countries that make you uneasy about your own bromides . 
  no , they 're not honest examples , they 're ostentatious and you fully know it . 
  `` bromides '' ...  i 'm just trying to ascertain when do you think it 's ok for someone to leave his country to build better life for themselves and their kids . 
  by your logic , all the rest of the planet is entitled to move into a single spot , just because the sacrificed country is wealthy . 
  do n't you realize how absurd are your motives , even if they 're justified for family ? 
  if it 's about your family , then you and others like you in the same situation , create the perfect enviroment for your children , for the future . 
  leaving everything behind means slacking . 
  and improvements in your country wo n't be done by ghosts or old-timers . 
  that is the essential part . 
  but you , just like my xenophiliac conationals , are blind behind your heads . 
   were immigrants to xvii century america immoral ? 
  we 're not in the xvii century . 
  deviating , yet again . 
  this is not argumentative reasoning , palinkowicz . 
  get that in your head . 
   what about a bangladeshi or iraqi for the bangladeshi , it 's a tragedy what the pakistani done to them . 
  but they wo n't build a nation , just as their founders intended , by simply running away . 
  for the iraqi , i have no straight answer . 
   or moldovan do n't you dare talk about them , palinkowicz . 
  do n't make us regret that bridgehead . 
  though , arguing with you , it 'd seem that it was a waste . 
  not to me and not to any other clear-conscienced romanian .
