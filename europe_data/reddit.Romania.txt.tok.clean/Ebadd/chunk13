  hands in fire , they most likely have dual citizenship , romanian and hungarian . 
  damned horthyists . 
  they knew what they were doing , otherwise , they would n't have done a circus involving hunting guns . 
   nah he 's just some guy that gets mad because romanian culture is n't being kept pure and isolated enough   ( brit in ro ) when i take blind shots about your nation , you can contradict me if i 'm wrong . 
  when problems like these arise , here , in my country , you have no word or say about it whatsoever . 
  is that clear , tommy ? 
  you 've asked me a question , i 've answered it . 
  deviating the answer into twisted , cynical & demented examples , is n't a fortitude frontrunner of a sharp mind . 
  otherwise , if you have anything else unclear about loyalty , let 's hear it . 
  they 're hungarian , and leave your obliviousness in the trash bin . 
  or are you a terrorist sympathizer ? 
  awww , no need to cry , you lil ' communist child , i 'm sure their owners wo n't harass them more than it is required for their sweet boo-boo ( you ) to eat the meals for this month . 
  though , i 'd clean hands if i were you , beforehand . 
  cheers !, 
  do you want to know what 's the worst part ? 
  those at fault , besides ramsay & his team , are the hungarians posing as romanians . 
  if roles were reversed , would 've france done the same ? 
   on what legal or even moral basis are you going to prevent me to leave the country when i want , come back when i want or work for who i want ? 
  you 're a moron to think anyone would tell you that and how . 
  there are * ways * , always ...  since when do i fucking owe you something kid ? 
  `` kid '' ? 
  is your daddy and mommy gone , sweetie ? 
  do you miss 'em , knowing that they unclog toilets for a living , under the illusion of a `` big '' wage ? 
  i do n't think you do boo-boo , otherwise , you 'd know those monthly euros you get are stained in piss & shit . 
  alas , you 're lucky money doe n't stink . 
  and you have better luck with * said * - maturity on 4chan or other anonymous forums . 
  try better next time . 
  the internet is a dangerous place for childs like you , acting high and mighty . 
   you call me communist swine but it is you the one who wants to employ their methods . 
  if you were older as you proclaim to be , you 'd know that communists used tactics to shut dissent and critics from within . 
  one such strategy was subterfuge shaming or insinuation using pathologic arguments : `` he does n't know what he talks about '' , `` the comrade is tired , he should retire '' , `` he 's blabbering like a madman '' etcetera . 
  of course , you do n't these , until now . 
  kid . 
   `` the east '' will never really `` get back on its own feet '' without relying on foreign-owned businesses , foreign-owned financial giants , and foreign-owned conglomerates . 
  historically it never was on it 's own feet and never will be because we 'll see about that , lil ' communist child . 
   `` the east '' is either sold to the west balancing to your line of thought , no thanks to your traitorous parents , child . 
  if the east is `` sold '' , it 's because of people like your parents . 
  why do you think i 'm calling them `` traitorous swines '' ? 
  they are stimulating the problem , not the solution ; they are part of the problem , not the solution . 
  yes , i do have such a metric : ** [ ... ] ask not what ** *** your country *** ** can do for you , ask what ** *** you *** ** can do for your country . 
  get a towel , a mop , and start cleaning . 
  pretending that you know better than me ? 
  what a strategy , just like the communists used to do : `` you do n't know what you 're talking/thinking '' . 
  gfy hypocrite , communist , swine !, 
  is poland north korea ? 
  if the east gets back on its * own * feet , ever , without relying on foreign-owned bussinesses , foreign-owned financial giants , and foreign-owned conglomerates , i 'd like - no , i 'd * adore * - if a complex system would be installed , preventing & blocking all of the expats , their children & the rest of their bastards down the bloodline , from ever coming back or reclaim anything based on long lost citizenship or ancestry in our ee countries . 
  a `` reversed iron curtain '' , just against those traitorous , hypocrite , ingrates . 
  mark my words , this will come , and they 'll smirk at the difficulties the countries had to bear ( nowadays ) until they decide to reclaim anything back when the hard part is over ... unless that system is installed and show them the big middle finger . 
   states should continue reforms , and worry less about making up fancy slogans to lure people back . 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  * edit * would you look at that , expats being butthurt . 
  got ta say , an ugly truth stings than a beautiful lie . 
  cognitive dissonance , your quotes are just above . 
  is that an invitation to ... protest ? 
   er , vw is also a spanish car company : it has a large spanish subsidiary , seat , which employs thousands of spanish workers and is also involved in the diesel scandal . 
  it is also a czech car company ( through skoda ) , a hungarian car company ( through the large audi operations in that country ) , etc. 
  its suppliers are also spread around the entire continent and beyond ( indeed , it also is the first chinese car company ) . 
    first of all , apple does n't own the chinese factories where most of its stuff is built , whereas vw does own its spanish , czech and hungarian factories . 
  big difference . 
  talking about absurd principles . 
  when a romanian does something , all hell breaks loose & lectured to no end via embassies ( who the fuck does anyone else does this on the planet ??? ) . 
  when the foreigner does something , he 's still a saint & gets international prizes . 
  growth = / = businesses are foreign-owned idiots ca n't tell the difference between a horse and a mule , then expect to surpass everybody else with their own firms that came here for cheap labor . 
  not gon na have that , that 's not how it works . 
   first of all , apple does n't own the chinese factories where most of its stuff is built , whereas vw does own its spanish , czech and hungarian factories . 
  big difference . 
  you just contradicted yourself . 
  i see no germanophile commented here , yet . 
  idiots downvoting just because of the title . 
   it 's probably my american talking but fuck stereotypes , self-loathing is n't healthy . 
   why did n't romania reinstate its monarchy ? 
  for two reasons : 1 ) normandy is n't in eastern europe . 
  2 ) no decommunization . 
  nazis were hunted , convicted , and purged . 
  communists & their families were spared . 
   iron guard grew in power . 
  the iron guard was banned by marshal antonescu after they 've started doing chaos , quite early . 
  * why * he needed them , initially , was because of the arrogance from the national-liberal party and conservative party . 
  expats do n't count . 
  ataturks , gulens & erdogans come and go , buddy . 
  turkey remains . 
  that 's what it * must * be important to you and yours . 
  you should stick to giving clients their menu and serve them their ordered dish . 
  cheatengine tables , trainers , and 3rd party injectors with additional cheats besides the normal ones ( though , these types were faded as far as i know ) . 
  oh , and multiplayer hacks/injections , in case you need to hear them rage in anger . 
  besides these ... 
  i do n't know any alternatives . 
  you should n't criticize your dead elders , dipshit . 
  no , i doubt you think of these trivial , clickbait , thoughts in your free time , karma wh - . 
  if you want a real , genuine , thought-provoking question to ask yourself , try this one : *** `` why the germans and russians could n't keep themselves from ruining a continent ? '' *** . 
  it 's a good thing he ordered to pass the dnieper , ** our conationals were deported into asia after the molotov-ribbentrop pact at that time and we wanted blood ! ** ... 
  but naaaaah , not for you apparently , that 's unimportant , the rusophiliacs like yourself have memory holes ; just like germanophiles . 
  he 's a moron and a rusophiliac , do n't pay attention to him . 
   we , generally speaking , are the upper middle class . 
  do n't pat yourself on the shoulder yet . 
  if you buy products at a discount and/or that are cheaper , than the expensive ones , you 're not `` upper middle '' class . 
  i thought you were neutral . 
  morning to you too . 
  instead of reindustrialization and diversify our economy in our hands , we build replicas . 
  top kek .
