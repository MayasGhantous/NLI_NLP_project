  is n't this protectionism , by bleeding others ( even your own ) just so you stay alive ? 
  hmmm ... 
  they need this for themselves , they 're using the italians as scapegoats . 
  this is whitewashing 2.0 : if it worked in greece , why not italy as well ? 
  * edit * buying even more risky debt , yes ? 
  although this was meant for the british to see & read , juncker just described the xenocentric , willful slaves , `` romanian '' expatriates with perfect accuracy , 100 % , 20/20 !, 
  this is great , i 'm saving this !, 
  his replies can be used against any so-called patriots & so-called nationalists that flee , for the same rhetoric , for the same reasons !, 
  it shows that poles are keen to not forget their language after a 1 year outside , unlike the * como se dice * expats . 
   roma ? 
  it 's `` roma * nian * '' or `` roma * nians * '' , not `` roma '' . 
   why have you got such a problem with other [ ... ] you should stick together . 
  traitors , hypocrites , deserters , self-haters , and all of those mixtures combined , do not deserve anything . 
  they 're out of the pack/tribe , they die . 
  end of story . 
  they want change and prosperity , yet they 've chosen the coward 's path . 
  imagine this : barely 10k can muster for protests before 2007 , but after 2007 , oohhhoooooo , over three million can leave the country with no problems , saying in unison `` fuck the country , i 'm moving out ! '' . 
  they 've shown & proven they do not care about the country 's well being & they do not care about others . 
  they 're a bunch of willful , xenocentric , slaves . 
  and cowards too . 
  they do n't deserve anything . 
  they 're traitors , pure and simple . 
  do you want an example that you can relate to ? 
  you , an irish , with the northern irish . 
  there . 
  if she did n't wanted to leave the country , she should n't have from the get-go . 
  the same is avaialbe for * you * and each one of you , xenocentrics . 
  if you and others truly , * truly * , wanted for the country to thrive , you would n't have done it by leaving en masse , then preaching cliches through social networks about change . 
  it just shows you 're a hell lot more degenerate ( and cowards ) than what you think of those whom remained in the country . 
  you do n't deserve a gram of dirt from a graveyard , much less respect or dignity . 
  ahh , yet another xenocentric subservient ~ ~ sla ~ ~ worker with a shattered dream where she can ~ ~ suc ~ ~ enjoy be of another nationality other than where she was born . 
  fuck her , she wanted out of the country ( like other 3 million useful tools ) , then stay out , and swallow the consequences . 
  btw , she 's not romanian anymore , she 's ` english/british ' . 
  trust me on this one , as vague as it might seem . 
   are you romanian ? 
  do n't worry , little ~ ~ sla - ~ ~ worker , they 'll still allow you to wipe their old people 's asses . 
  or , who knows , maybe they 'll ruin your lil ' xenocentric fantasy . 
  go and be more subservient . 
  this is as useful as those polls were during the campaign . 
  a looot and fearmongering , and now they 're mocking . 
  so easy to modify data and claim it your own . 
  it 's not difficult . 
  then , idiots will bite it and believe it without thinking if this is another way for spreading propaganda . 
  * ce cretinism netanderthal , xenocentric & servil inferiorist . 
  see this useful tool here ^ ? 
  choo_choo would be the kind of useful slave that thinks stalin is a good guy . 
  your sturgeon will have to wait until - what - 2019 , 2020 or 2021 ? 
  there 's no more political power after the scottish unionists voted in . 
  [ read ** this ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4p6jfp/with_brexit_this_week_are_you_in_or_out/d4ijxky ) and stop shoving imported carrots up your arsehole . 
  i suggest giving yourself two slaps over the face with some ice , since it 's june and hot as hell . 
  * and fuck the frenchie , norwegian and everybody else that are thinking like stalinists/communists/fascists . 
  you and other xenocentric ex-patriates will have to ask yourselves this : why romania , without a popular vote mind you , joined the eu to give the false opportunity of growth ( scrubbing shit , picking strawberries , homecare for the elderly etcetera , etcetera ; that no native would ever want to do those jobs ) , while the home country is being overtaken by foreign entities ? 
  the autochthonous industry will never be brought back . 
  have fun memeing and writing down cliches . 
  the eastern part ca n't have an active role since it does n't own anything to its worth . 
  if you do this , you 'll destroy the concept of democracy forever . 
  do n't listen to this clown . 
  and if you do , and your parliamnet does this ... prepare for a literal bloodbath . 
  you 'd be destroying your country and this man clearly wants that , for what the old empire did . 
  no regrets , go forward . 
   now many people have been complaining about this petition that has started in the uk calling for a 2nd referendum because of turnout and slim margins . 
  52 % - 48 % is a slim margin ? 
  there are hundred of thousands difference , than just a point or . xx points differences . 
   1 ) 16 and 17 year olds were n't allowed to vote - this pissed a lot of people off ( myself included ) you 're insinuating for an illegality * just because ... * . 
   as this referendum will affect the younger people the most and its the younger people who want to remain in the eu the most . 
  i 'm pretty sure the post-wwii world was shaken for those younglings ( aka . 
  your grandparents and great-grandparents ) as well , they 've continued to live well , unlike the other side of the * curtain * . 
   how is it fair that the younger generation can not vote in this referendum while the old people who dragged us into this shit storm wo n't have to suffer the consequences of there selfish actions . 
  the same reason they had to face the cold war when their parents or grandparents fought through a war + the reconstruction period . 
  if you ban people because of age , you 're no better than a eugenicist or advocating for democide . 
   2 - limit immigration if i were them , i 'd advocate the same thing . 
  the immigration policy is harming your manpower and opportunities against your own good . 
  on the other hand , it 's a healthy wake-up call for how resistant your economy is for its pound & pence 's worth . 
  will it hurt ? 
  sure , but if it has to be rebuilt , then you need an equalizer . 
  brexit was that equalizer . 
  on the other side ( speaking on behalf of my xenocentric , subservient , ex-conationals , * not * others ) , it 's also true : the ~ ~ mor - ~ ~ ~ ~ idio - ~ ~ ~ ~ sla - ~ ~ ex-patriates working low-tier jobs , for the mirage of a `` good pay '' , is harming them more than they realise . 
  they think that a currency convertor is a decisive factor for when determining a better hdi ( ~ ~ idio ~ ~ jobes ca n't see differences between monetary policy and fiscal policy , but that 's another cookie to bite off ) , while blackmailing the country 's economic capacity on the long run . 
  * again , except pariahs , because they were lost since they were born , they ca n't be helped . 
  * sure , they 're useful idiots , but i have a soft spot for those idiots that are being used against their own good , on the long run . 
  but perhaps that 's cultural , we did n't had an empire . 
  would * i * want them to come back ? 
  hell no , they 're no different than a fifth column and infiltrated agents working against their country of origins . 
   in the past 2 days the vote leave has come out and said that they made ' a mistake ' on the # 350 million to the nhs and they ca n't do this . 
  tbh , from what i 've seen , they were n't different than what your conationals talk about project fear . 
  think for a second , out in the cold : are your ' * leavers * ' more toxic for what they 've decided to vote for * or * those whom convinced them to vote like that ? 
  do you understand the question ? 
  is it worth blaming the other side of the voting spectrum , since this project fear & the fearmongering ( white-black , life-death ... ) gave them the impression it 'll be worth outside thna inside ? 
  remember that labour mp , jo cox : when they 've used her death as political gain , that surely did n't sit well for many voters . 
  it 's more than just * younglings vs old people * , do n't fall into that trap . 
  behaving like a sore loser does n't help either , calm yourself . 
  while they might regret using that # 350 million slogan , it pales in comparrison with project fear . 
  at least , * they * are honest and admit it , * unlike ... them * . 
  that 's a plus , if i see one . 
   a leave mp has also backtracked on what his campaign said and says that they ca n't limit migration . 
  they lied about the two things which convinced many ( stupid ) people to vote for them . 
  they ca n't limit immigration like snapping your fingers , that 'd be correct , but not inaccurate within the rhetoric . 
   they lied about the two things which convinced many ( stupid ) people to vote for them . 
  you 're belittleling your own conationals , i 'd be careful if i were you . 
  that 's not a sign of maturity , nor a reason for wanting 16-year olds & 17-year olds to vote .
