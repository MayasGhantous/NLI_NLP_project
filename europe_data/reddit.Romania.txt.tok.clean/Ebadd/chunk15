  you 're not credible . 
   and the leave campaign have admitted to completely lying about their 2 only valid points for leaving the eu . 
  there were more than just two , from what i 've seen . 
  take it from a foreigner . 
  old people die . 
  so , there 's that . 
   this `` professor '' is serving a 10 year prison sentence on corruption charges . 
  he was also indicted for blackmail . 
  wan na rediscuss the whole dossier and find out how 's that a baloney ? 
  and how several innocent people are doing prison time just because of association with him , since he refused to pledge help for the crony ex-president ? 
   he managed to write 8 `` economics '' books in his first 16 months in prison , in order to have his sentence reduce . 
  this in turn lead to an investigation for the university professors that reviews these books and classified them as scientist papers . 
  on of them is also indicted as a result . 
  yes , because he did n't write any books before he was executed for prison time , nor he did n't had many * in-the-works * before being executed . 
  *  he is now writing this opinion piece from jail . 
  so , if a political figure is executed and thrown in jail , is he refrained from opinions * just because * ... ? 
   please refrain from clicking the link . 
  anecdotal ambiguity and bias . 
   should give enough perspective . 
  it does n't . 
  do throw the entire dossier and let others decide if it was money laundering or political execution . 
  do it , since you 're so confident . 
  his case has been discussed tens of thousands of times 'till fatigue kicks , his dossier was a commanded execution by the ex-president and his puppets . 
  and everything started when he refused the ex-president for mass-media support ; the same as putin and his cronies enjoy , when they removed anyone that did n't submit to the establishment . 
   brexit is the perverted effect of globalization . 
   the 1989 events occuring within the european union , the brutal/forceful opening of markets and takeover of resources from east european countries specifically , were thought-out for 25 years . 
   during this time , the opened markets were conquered and every oportunity , which had the national resources at interest , were accessed . 
   now , the great contributors of the european union 's budget do n't want a cohesive political policy anymore . 
   [ an ] opened question : *** will the next years confirm the fact that , what happened today , was thought-out ever since 1989 ? 
  *** ----------- do explain what * `` lacking credible source '' * is , besides ** anecdotal ambiguity ** , since it 's a blog from a university professor that knows economics . 
  the translation is here ; it was n't done by the browser 's auto-translator , i can guarantee that . 
   who is currently in prison on command from the ex-president and his puppets . 
  i 'd tread lightly , if i were you .

  so ... how 's sepp blatter ? 
  anything new ? 
  good pleb , you 've earned this month 's wage for picking up strawberries this month . 
  the next one , you 're expected to wash shit from old people 's asses . 
  neither do pro-guns topics , yet it showed how much it worked for ya . 
  sometimes i wonder if the secret services do n't have a stake in this murder , with the guy 's behaviour . 
  it 's too coincidental and coy . 
   central government only seems to give a shit about london . 
  you too ? 
   `` france is a good team , '' one romania supporter told euronews . 
  `` it 's the best team in europe . 
  i 'm proud for romania . 
  2-1 is nothing . '' you could see they were expecting it . 
  a lot of cognitive dissonance , you talk about the adversaries as being the best team , while still putting a facade of proudness for our own . 
  not to mention , the horrible , horrible `` jokes '' . 
  it 's disgusting more than anything . 
  and some think xenocentrism is n't a problem . 
  as it was expected ... * always *, 
  this is n't a russian article , hell , it 's even a critique . 
   imports will be more expensive if you trade by wto rules , exports will be lower if you trade by wto rules . 
  for curiosity 's sake , which wto rules , specifically ? 
  yes . 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  says the austrian . 
  great , if i ever manage to visit these united states , i wo n't have to worry ~ ~ about ~ ~ for my life ~ ~ of ~ ~ from paranoid cops or criminal gangs , so much so , than drafts . 
   romania can into schengen ? 
  not before * they * get their way and force us to privatize their claws into constanta . 
   was banned in / r/romania . 
  as if that subreddit is the milestone of anything . 
  pfft , a fart . 
   nutjob better a `` nutjob '' than a vapid xenocentric . 
  then i guess harry white 's plan was superb , with the only vice being a communist . 
   i 'm not saying that everything that happened was due to outside forces , but it was because of outside forces . 
   yellow : national liberal party ( center-right ) they 're [ centre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centrism ) , not centre-right . 
  they never were centre-right since their historical & post-89 conception . 
  oh , and looking at it carefully , i 'd say that the * democrat-liberals * won at the end of the day , not * national-liberals * . 
   green : democratic union of hungarians in romania ( they claim to represent all hungarians in romania , generally considered center-right ) any political faction that focuses on differentiations & collectivism is centre/centre-left . 
  tell the guy that he 's an insolent hypocrite for not changing anything nor wanting to change something , along with other +3 million that left the country . 
  they 're all & thinking the same : complaining and throwing lame conniption fits for something he does n't care , yet does n't have any problem to comment about . 
  in short , tell him to gtfo if he wants to ` repair ' something , make him put his money where his mouth is if things are so awful to him or anyone else who thinks like him . 
  honestly , what a subservient , xenocentric , idiot that he is ... complaining at a [ long ] distance is a coward 's bargain : a double standard . 
  he does n't care about anything , he just likes to complain , just like the other +3 million that left the country , then have the nerve to comment at all for lack of changes or provocations . 
  one key observation for my xenocentric * ex - * conationals & conationals , to take notice , and restrain from any complaints in the future : *** it 's hunky-dory to piss on the country when you think you 're living the good life , yet , on the other hand , it 's abrasive & unacceptable when the country pisses on you when it 's been proven you were/are absolute cretins & jackasses to begin with , is n't it . 
  *** - u/mr-goat , i insist , do tell the sucker this , * at least * the last part . 
   i have mixed feelings about this . 
  there , fixed that for you . 
   europe and america made mistakes , but the misery of ~ ~ the arab world ~ ~ romania is caused mainly by ~ ~ its ~ ~ their own failures change a few , change everything . 
  jesus is coming , look busy hunting after flying pigs . 
  ^ this romanian richest will spend few years in jail , if any . 
  when he 'll serve his time , all the ill-gotten properties & wealth will be untounched and he 'll still be the richest , like the rest which spent time in prison . 
  * move along , nothing to see , romanianinsider spewing bullshit & halftruths as usual . 
  shellshock/ptsd is n't genetically inherited , doofy . 
   have you ever been to romanian villages to see how poorly educated people are ? 
  you ca n't trust them with carrying a gun !, 
  the perfect slaves ... willful ignorant to their demise and oblivious xenocentrism . 
  they should n't worry , the wages are shit compared to theirs . 
  that 's why it 's so `` cheap '' . 
  now , on the other hand , if we had their wages * or bigger * + these cheap prices ? 
  a whole different story ... 
   intel has been laying off a huge amount of their workforce globally , bucharest was one such victim . 
  i do n't think there is going to be a cascade of companies pulling out of romania . 
  *** i do not care about others .
