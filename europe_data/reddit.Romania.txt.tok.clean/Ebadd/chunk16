  i care for my own , *** even for mindless xenocentric degenerates that ca n't distinguish the good from the bad . 
  * except * for expatriates , their loyalty has been sealed . 
   so it is a good demonstration of how it can drive up wages are n't you playing clueless , just when i 've argued at every point you 've assessed . 
   when did i say romanian ownership is bad ? 
  `` for every action , there 's an equal and opposite reaction . '', 
  your appraisal for foreign ownership means the opposite . 
  xenocentrics are blind , by choice or ignorance , but you 'll find a hive mind to address their fantasy with that ; not me . 
  banned from a [ pro-xenocentric ] subreddit = gonner/no use of arguing with * said * user got it , * you * settle the bar . 
  you can go back and wipe the shit from herr rudolf 's ass . 
  remember to bring a clean pair of adult diapers . 
   intel may have laid some people off , but what is the year on year growth for tech wages ? 
  the last time i read about it , it was significant . 
  and now they 'll pink slip , one by one . 
  that 's reality . 
  intel is just the beginning . 
   but romanian it wages are catching up with those elsewhere i would bet , not all romanians work in it , not all romanains want to work in it . 
   and it 's because of foreign investment . 
  translation : and it 's because of foreign * ownership * [ , not autochtonous/romanian ownership ] . 
   if i receive investment and set up a team in romania , it is brining in outside capital which would n't ever touch the hands of a romanian , even if they are working for someone in london/san francisco . 
  repeating the same vapid , rebutted , arguments about foreign ownership . 
    * foreign ownership = gooood *   * romanian ownership = baaaad * anything else ? 
  * i 'd rather be careful in bringing up subcontractors , if i were you . 
  y ` see , there was this foreign multinational promising us highways , we paid a lot of money , and they 've hired subcontractors to do nothing of importance . 
  same thing happened once with a spanish firm with doing parking lots . 
  they 've came , did the paperwork , got the money , and did n't do anything . 
  yay foreign ownership !, 
   are business supposed to never fire anyone ever for your benefit ? 
  they did n't fired because `` hurr durr , you ai n't working '' , they 're closing an entire department , the r&d . but it was expected , r&d departments & manufacturer departments walk hand in hand . 
  but that 's just another quirk a xenocentrist does n't or wo n't understand . 
   do romanian companies never fire anyone ? 
  name one that is autochthonous and does n't rely on prefabricated or ready-made imports in order to operate . 
   ah , forget it , you 're fucking nuts . 
  honestly , any insult is n't near as damaging as being a xenocentric ... like you and cilica . 
   it 's like you ca n't cope with how the world works and you have to make up fantasy world views . 
  it 's like you ca n't fathom that an independent romanian enterprise can not be held on native hands , unless you think it can be only done if it 's state-owned , never to think about being privately owned and in our hands . 
  no , you can fathom that only foreigners can own privately everything . 
  that 's how daft you are . 
   it 's sad really . 
  cue the internet `` it 's sad really '' cliche . 
  [ let 's watch some seth meyers , from 1:39 , to the end . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whgsh33d8bk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m39s ), 
   as wages increase that becomes less of a factor , and more investment becomes available . 
  when economic booms happens , they close and move somewhere else . 
  [ intel ] ( http://www.zfcorporate.ro/zf-print/prima-pagina/intel-inchide-biroul-de-la-bucuresti-unde-lucrau-circa-200-de-programatori-15375377 ) just closed and gave the pink slip to 150-200 programmers . 
  well that 's the price for having a foreign entity , for when we talk about wage boost . 
   more people try to buy romanian labour , the cost goes up . 
  yes , when romanian labor is at your doorstep . 
   i do n't see why this would be a controversial point . 
  if jobs are diverted from country a to country b , guess who gains ? 
  to give eurozone as example , the wage of a portughese engineer , in his own country , pales in comparrison to that of an engineer in france or uk . 
  should i continue to example with our own , when it 's obvious ? 
  how about we reach london 's standards and ... no , no , better yet , let 's exceed them *** then *** * you * can complain all much you want . 
  how about that , huh ? 
  pretentious , delusional , ~ ~ dimwit ~ ~ jobe ... talking about others when * we , ourselves , * are n't at 1/11 of those levels !, 
  let 's not forget the infamous call-centres . 
  haha !, 
   and what is your solution ? 
  semi-autarky , export oriented , both with our own autochtonous economic output and foreigners ' . 
  that 's the best all of you xenocentrics can do , always point out to the past what ceausescu did , then conclude the opposite as the best choice . 
  autarky is n't bad in itself , when globalization is autarky . 
  but that 's too much to fanthom , huh . 
   be smart about your own education the education has become an infectious cliche . 
  guess what : colleges wo n't teach you how to make it in life , nor teach how to develop a genuine , export-oriented , business . 
  alas , let 's read poems , solve some calculus , do it courses or join the force ( police , secret services ) ... that 's the best your education can do . 
  * `` what , there 's a problem ? 
  well , education hurr durr '' * ... yes , education ... that 's the reason romanians ca n't develop a business beyond kiosks , restaurants , gyms , web design , web coding ... that 's the best we can do ... yay the education [ thought-terminating cliche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clich%c3%a9#thought-terminating_clich.c3.a9 ) . 
   the only way to advance is to accept foreign investment * investitie straina = / = nerambursabil * . 
  proposing exactly what i 've been saying : foreign-based economy ( aka . 
  territorial lend-lease ) . 
  that 's the best * you * can do . 
  nah , xenocentrics deserve it . 
  you again ? 
   increased foreign investment will improve the lives of romanians , foreign investment = / = irredeemable investment . 
  whatever has been done since 1990 , it has been a complete campaign to shutdown everything and replace with foreign entities . 
  that was the economic liberalisation for us . 
  kids here know nothing . 
  i ca n't recommend [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wdt5j/the_hypocrisy_of_eastern_europe/cxvjk16?context=3 ) enough for details of what happened . 
  the reason you have romanians come into your doorstep to work your filthy , low-leveled , jobs that you have - that nether * you * nor any of your british conationals would n't do yourself out of pride or dignity - is because the liberalisation got us out of everything that had to do with light & heavy industry ( with all its vices ) . 
  now , the so-called growth is done under the guise of foreign companies , corporations , multinationals , instead of being/doing it under our own . 
  * gypsies are another topic to discuss . 
  * some of you , the british , complain that companies which reside within your territory are hiring foreigners to artificially debase wages . 
  or that you had a multinational working on your territory , but moved in the east , because it wanted to pay less wages , yet it expected the same or higher output . 
  on the other side of the spectrum , the wages are not equitable if we were to compare them + tax evasion because , why not , `` if you strike us down , you 'll have to handle the layoffs '' . 
   by increasing salaries and similar , salaries/wages do n't rise any more than what 's the output on exports . 
  if it 's export done to a foreign entity , then it 's hogwash . 
  the very same exports that are done under a foreign company 's trademark , keeps everything in its pocket , ` cept giving away salaries/wages that would n't compare to other countries ( ie . 
  a white collar 's payment in uk = / = [ the same ] white collar job 's payment in romania ) . 
  when there 's a better deal to * not * have to pay as lot more , they kick the can because they can since there 's no allegiance with the country in question , except its country of origin . 
   regardless of who `` owns '' the enterprises . 
  rolls royce , what a once magnificent car manufacturer of british origins/extraction , now owned by ze deutschlander 's bmw . 
  oooh , lookie-lookie , what do we have [ here ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/rolls-royce-tells-employees-britain-better-in-eu ) : economic blackmail or , shall i say , peer pressure . 
  if rolls royce would 've still been in british hands ( preferably private , given its history ) , that article would n't have existed in the first place . 
  * note : i honestly do not care what the uk does , i 'm presenting a rebuttal to your argument , not what it 's being discussed per se . 
  and , by all means , it 's not only car manufacturing , it 's everything that is n't or was in british control . 
  *  just because you 're also earning some company in new york money does n't mean you do n't also benefit . 
  let 's see , a foreign company keeps the most of the earnings ( profits + comission ) , it 's dodges taxes because the authorities of that country ( and politics ) can not handle the layoffs ( it 's legal after all ) , inequitable wages ( wages in lei , romania < wages in pound sterling , uk ) , money from the eu meant to stimulate the economy ( which are subverted subsidies under another name for the foreign companies operating in the country ) , and overall economic power/leverage on the global market . 
  the romanian benefits from ... a wage , upon his/her life depend . 
  yeah , sure , `` it does n't matter who owns it '' ... btw , i have a bridge to sell . 
  interested ? 
   once there is more money in the country , there will be more romanian entrepreneurs , and then you can start building more things that are owned by romanians .
