  you poor fella , try rebuild an industry with a foreigner 's investments , then * not * expect them to own a huge piece of the pie ? 
  the biggest a romanian can hope to own are second-third rate businesses : restaurants , kiosks , gyms , small transport firms , clubs , bars , coffee shops ... all of them ~ ~ constituting ~ ~ relying , mostly , on import from foreign producers . 
  continuing the obliviousness ... and what a good servile xenocentric you are . 
   state owned businesses this has nothing - nor what i 've written - to do with state ownership . 
  u/cilica it does n't matter who owns the enterprise , you say ? 
  this could and will be renault . 
  foreign-based `` territorial lend-leased '' economy = / = genuine , autotchtonous , growth tsk , romaniainsder spewing half-truths , yet again . 
  we 'll forever be behind others , never to exceed them , because * we * do n't own any of the big players or equivalents to compete on the global market . 
  that 's power ; not to whom you 're thankful that you have a stagnated , inequitable , wage , barely over the median . 
  by all means , the average blue/white collar worker wo n't think beyond the paycheck or who owns the business they 're working at , that 's settled . 
  when you read about this * so * - called growth , it 's not * us * who 'll benefit on the long run . 
  make-believe all you want , your paycheck & flashy percentages does n't mean * jack - * when the industrial capacity ( primary , secondary & tertiary sectors ; what constitutes producerism , * not consumerism * ; the whole manufacture base ) is absent beyond doubts and not owned by * our own/ourselves * . 
  yeah , sure , do that when you depdend on foreign firms , companies & corporations for additional $ $ $ at your budget , then you can ride that high horse all you want . 
  however , on the upside , we 're fortunate that a zombie apocalypse happens on an island , otherwsie , we 'd be fucked if it were on mainland .

  is it good to promote the gns ? 
  grab a mirror . 
  heh , the new jews . 
  were they a lot more rude than the french ? 
  thank soros for that . 
  bravo , ya glorious soaw . 
  nowadays , are n't you obsessed with skin colour , to the point where ethnicity does n't matter anymore ? 
  hello jorge !, 
  got ta disagree witchu ` ere . 
  whataboutism . 
  how quaint when it 's others saying that , while pricking others into a double/faulty standard , yet affirming they 're fair in their judgement because '' others do it tot '' , despite not being true . 
  of course they do n't , they clearly think of themselves as superior than the '' regateni '' ... or the others spewing '' nem , nem nemzet '' . 
  keep those american jargons , argots & mindset out of this . 
  use them when the narrative fits the discussion when you 're discussing with an american partner . 
  calm down , it means that the country 's economic capacity can not sustain +22 million peeps without having a dictatorship keeping everyone in . 
  we should wait and the natural ( not imported ) population boom will occur during our great-grandchildren 's time . 
  if the population will be artificially growing via imported xeni , then we might as well die out as the great tit . 
  there 's no such thing as '' irish '' - american . 
  i 'd feel the same ; the weeaboo result is a bit surprising tbh , though , i don ' fall for that either . 
  the uniformizing , cosmopolitist , of '' let 's like everybody '' is boring , unoriginal , forced , and is n't let alone to develop itself naturally without political or ideological ulterior motives & pressure ( you 'll sense a pressure ) . 
  btw , you got ta love this interesting characteristic of '' muddying the water '' they got here : they combine the ethnic background up top , with religious background down below . 
  if that ai n't interestingly quaint , i dunno what it ... 
  american jargons , argots & mindset are n't relevant here . 
  use 'em if it 's necessary when talking to an american partner in discussion . 
  some still have prejudices since the habsburg empire , yet those who suffer from it , seem to have no problem with it . 
  and ? 
  why the long faces ? 
  this is the foreign investor , that we 've been told by every xenophiliac economist , to '' help '' the easterners out of poverty . 
  australian or new zealander or south african . 
  really ? 
  how would liam neeson 's [ monologue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzoywn1qari ) be if he was british ? 
  i love you in a non-gay way . 
  forget the other three . 
  why did n't you adopted romansh as the national language , instead of german , french & italian ? 
  one time , you were pondering why i hate xenophiles , germanophiles respectively . 
  now you know . 
  [ smile ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitwehraboossay/comments/6pfz5u/wittmann_was_a_true_hero_charging_across_open/ ) , wehraboo . 
  wrong . 
  one of the prime reasons romania is n't in schengen area is because we do n't want to privatize our ports and give it to german-dutch-french interests . 
  yet , in france 's case with this port , apparently , it 's a '' matter of national strategic defense '' . 
  double standards . 
  i actually feel pity , for once , for the italians . 
   you 're just dropping buzzwords without understanding them because this has nothing to do with nepotism either . 
  projecting . 
  i wonder why the france state was so reluctant to sell it , first it was 25 % , now it 's 50 % , yet with strings attached . 
  if that ai n't veiled corruption !, 
  then , i have to imagine what sorts of deal did they reach , though , seems like the french state made a custom-made offer to be rejected just so they can nationalise it 100 % . 
  strike number two . 
  afterwards , we have this economic blackmail ( '' ultimatum '' ) itself . 
  for the moment , i 've searched , and there is n't known the conditions for which the italians were so outraged in the deal ( chances are the french counterpart wo n't make it public ; lack of transparency thereof ) . 
  strike number three . 
  and i did n't even began to fanthom what political sleazy deals ( political campaign funds , money transffered in special account ( s ) just so those involved in teh deal could chip a bit of the money they would receive ; either by selling it or nationalising it ) . 
   this nationalization would fully respect eu laws . 
  it does n't . 
  the french state is bullying private businesses & goes against the liberal economic principles that ee has ~ ~ suffered ~ ~ went through . 
  double standards , jean-pierre . 
   that 's exactly the mindset i 'm talking about . 
   instead of accepting that prices are set by the desire to maximise profits , eastern europeans believe that this is a class system and they pay more because they are eastern europeans . 
  i 'm convinced that , if harry dexter white 's plan was implemented fully to the end , the central european mindset would be that of the eastern european 's . 
  that opportunity can always be present , on the table , in the correct , favourable , circumstances . 
   you pay more because you are willing to pay more . 
  stop buying stuff that you think is overpriced . 
  lookie , lookie , it does n't work here . 
  supply and demand , be damned . 
  ask your embassy in bucharest , visualize & create a double standard , and they 'll write a list why this ( if it were the romanian state , in comparison ) would be an act of corruption . 
  how does this have anything to do with corruption , you ask ? 
  i 'll paraphrase embassies for when they made a circus declaring all sorts of bullshit released press declarations , again , paraphrasing : '' ... because the state does it '' . 
  what the french authorities would do , with this nationalisation , is corruption * for the same exact reason * foreign embassies been telling romanian media outlet when they buggered their nose in our cases : '' [ it 's corruption ] because the state does it '' . 
  ther ' ya go , this constitutes corruption because the french state would do it ( do n't forget the veiled economic blackmail , the threat ) . 
  nevermind the eu legislation , in which this constitutes favoritism , nepotism respectively . 
  i wonder if embassies in paris will come out & tell the french mass-media that what the french authorities would do constitutes as an act of corruption . 
  if the romanian government would even dare to do something like this , we 'd be 24/7 on the 7 o'clock news in the west about how romania is corrupt , ngos propped up by foreign money would take it on the streets to yell like the useful idiots they are , and the news media saying how everyone else in the eu are angels , while we are the '' most corrupt '' . 
  * how long until eastern europeans demand the eu to not be treated as 2nd class citizens throughout the eu ? 
  there 's a twist : bigger indirect & personal taxes , and prices . 
  your rebellious seventy-sixth-removed cousins invented a term for this : '' to be nickled & dimed ( to the bone/to death ) '' . 
  so , how much are you truly wealthy , apart from what your stock exchange & some digits written on some flashy panels indicate ? 
  yeah , from a monetary perspective , the ` pound ' is '' heavier '' than our '' light '' ` lion ' ; if converted , you 'll have more ` lions ' extracted from one ` pound ' . 
  vagabond mentality says that it 's good to work in the uk & while you leisure and spend the money in a 2nd or 3rd world country . 
  i 've yet to see a country that has the wages & benefits of a 1st world country and prices & rents at the rate of those from second & third world-countries . 
  * that * would be as close as reaching to heaven than the babylonian tower . 
  ownership , revenues , royalties , bonuses , cooking the books & profits talk . 
  everything else is romanticising labour & boasting , useless , daydreaming . 
  mockingly speaking , this looks more like a lapsed syndicalist behaviour . 
  corporate officers & accountants know what 's up , when they report to the executive board , ceo and/or chairman .
