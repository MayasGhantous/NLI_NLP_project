  if you do n't trust yourselves ...  do i believe that it will happen ? 
  no , it would be stopped before it got this far , but is it technically possible ? 
  yes , it is . 
  * fearmongering . 
   and it actually irrelevant , people that suffered or had their lives ruined after 2010 disagree , more so those that committed suicide or were thrown out of their homes . 
   you can say what you want about bankers , those fat cats in their limos with tinted windows , but it is not the main issue . 
  because they 're swedish ? 
   without crypto normal people would not be able to use online banking securely , they would not be able to do online shopping or even trust that website has not been altered on it 's way from the server to the computer/tablet/phone correlation does not imply causation . 
  you 're fearmongering . 
   personally , i see no need to hide my banking info , my passwords , my ssn , you know , stuff that prevents identity theft ? 
  if you think an officer from the secret services do n't have the means to get all of that , legally or * '' legally '' * , i have a bridge to sell ...  private messages , company info when working from home , meaningless !, 
  what 's so private into companies , other than tax evasions or market manipulation ? 
  you 're not carrying the launch codes . 
  why would you be in favour of protecting banksters ? 
  ( bit of a strawman ), 
  if you have nothing to hide ... you have nothing to worry about , right ? 
  that too , yes . 
   i 'm surprised by the german emigration to us . 
  of all the european nations , it seems to me the brits are the most common immigrants . 
  of the people i know in town , it looks like this :  4 british  1 irish  1 bosnian  1 ~ ~ romanian ~ ~ noveaux american  1 albanian  but no germans . 
  this is all anecdotal , of course . 
  i would guess german immigrants are heading to big cities . 
  more accurate . 
   why do you stop there ? 
  i am referring to current year . 
  [ proclamation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_of_islaz )  gypsies that are born in romania have romanian citizenship , thus that fix is not needed or valid . 
  citizenship is a privilege , not a right . 
   you do have the habit of wild and weak hypothesis , do n't you ? 
  you should n't look into the mirror while typing , i 'm not the one throwing hypotheses/hypothesises . 
   as citizens of romania they have the same rights as romanians that do n't share their ethnicity . 
  not if they 're a minority ( said & proven ) , and why citizenship is a privilege . 
   the hypothesis about my background . 
  the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence . 
  calling yourself a romanian ( here , where everybody is a stranger ) , does n't exclude the possibility for me to believe that you 're an ashamed disillusioned gypsy trying to pose as a romanian ; just because you have a privilege , as a minority , known as citizenship . 
   i see that the nationalism is very strong within you . 
  i recommend joining the army . 
  what is greater than a sacrifice for one 's country ? 
  romanian '' nationalism '' is xenophiliac & internationalistic , at this moment & time . 
  i think * you * are a nationalist , albeit the counterproductive type . 
   why do we have separate words for man and humanity if they mean the same thing ? 
  bzzzt !, 
  bravo , you 've answered yourself regarding '' rom/rrom '' being '' human '' , while everyone else is '' non-human '' . 
   it means a * man * from the ethnic group or a husband it is n't weak as you think , according to this little part :   rom means man or husband in the romani , it has the variants dom and lom , related with the sanskrit words dam-pati [ lord of the house , husband ] , dama [ to subdue ] , lom [ hair ] , lomaka ( hairy ) loman , roman [ hairy ] . 
  roma\u00e7a [ man with beard and long hair ] . 
  man , mankind , human , humanity ... hmmm ... 
   i 'm not saying they are ashamed about their roots . 
  i 'm just saying that gypsies are romanian citizens and they fall under the romanian 's state responsibility . 
  i 'm saying that over time they became european native being here for long enough and mixing with the population and some actually fully assimilating . 
  citizenship not a right , only privilege . 
  they 're a minority that we already know where their roots are . 
  living with us could just as well be considered an extended rent and that 's it . 
   is rock 'n roll exclusive for white people ? 
  evidently not , but neither does it make every white person an american or , if you want to extend it , an aglo-saxon . 
   how does your comparison shows no relation between two cultures , but suddenly ` manele ' shows a connection between gypsies and middle-easterners ? 
  you can start with this person : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhammad_of_ghor, 
  flavius made a good point : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6dfmet/president_iohannis_nato_appreciates_romanias/di2lmif/ secondly , what is '' roma/rroma '' in their language and is persisted ? 
  it 's '' human '' , correct ? 
  very well then , if they consider themselves as '' human '' , then everybody else is a. . . '' non-human '' ? 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania  the very first document attesting the presence of roma people in wallachia dates back to 1385 , and refers to the group as a\u0163igani ( from , athiganoi a greek-language word for `` heretics '' , and the origin of the romanian term \u0163igani , which is synonymous with `` gypsy '' ) 1848 - 1470 | 1471 = 600 ? 
  or with your numbers 1848 - 1386 = 600 ? 
   romanians ~ ~ * may * ~ ~ are not ~ ~ be ~ ~ gypsies , fixed that for accuracy . 
  again , tell your buddies ( which i bet they 're french ) we 're not like them . 
   but some gypsies are in fact romanian . 
  citizenship is a privilege , not a right , nor it does n't prove ethnic authenticity . 
  just because iliescu gave them citizenship , it does n't mean he made them someone else besides whom they are . 
   your hypothesis is laughable . 
  which/what '' hypothesis '' ? 
   is it inconceivable for a non-gypsy to care about their right and to know history ? 
  their right and history is more or less 5,626 kilometers ( or 3,496 miles ) attaway , in jammu/kashmir/punjab ( amazing coincidences , btw ) . 
  your question is malicious that might insinuate smugness . 
  * shame on you !, 
  * no , nobody is against them for finding out about their right or history , yet do not act as if you 're doing this out of your own pocket money or honesty at heart or without some insinuations from your acquaintances with foreign names . 
  this is specifically what the french insinuate , i recognize the tone and narrative . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_in_the_early_middle_ages  the east germanic goths and gepids , who lived in sedentary communities , were the first new arrivals . 
  the goths dominated moldavia and wallachia from the 290s , and parts of transylvania from the 330s . 
  their power collapsed under attacks by the nomadic huns in 376 . 
  o-ha-ha , you know very well what i mean - or if you do n't , maybe it 's better that way . 
   the kids were raised as house slaves , bastards . 
  everyone knew that a maid was the mother . 
  they still lived on the domain . 
   they lived their lives from past to present like everyone did . 
  the integration is a separate issue influenced by a lot of things that do n't only boil down to ` they do n't want to ' your optimism leaves a lot to be desired , now you 're romanticizing bastardy ( in ee of all places ) , as some form of social upheaval . 
  they died without legitimate claim to their father stuff ( if they were ) , they either went broke & died childless ( most likely ) , lost into obscurity in time , killed , committed suicide , or went back to their roots as gypsies . 
  integration is n't an issue if they do n't want to lose their identity as gypsies . 
  nor will they ever be seen as anything else , but gypsies . 
  again , why are you , or promoting in general , the revisionist malice that they are ashamed of whom they are ? 
  they are a separate people , tracing their roots , that came from the northern region that is now in india . 
  there 's nothing else . 
   but there is a share that have the same lifestyle like the common romanian citizen . 
  if i like rock 'n roll music , does that make me an american ? 
  if i wear trousers , does that make me a german ? 
  if i speak , write , and listen in english , does that make me an anglo-saxon ? 
  if i eat baguette , am i french ? 
  if one of my acquaintances listen to that god-awful shitty excuse of a music , does that make him a gypsy ? 
  ( on the other hand , i 've seen a lot of middle-easterners liking those noises . 
  hmmm ... ) the answer is beyond obvious for all of those questions : no . 
   do you mean to tell that during close to 600 years , gypsies and romanians did n't mix together ? 
  i think the user does , yes . 
  correlation is n't causation ( although , where did you found that 600 span , only you know ) .
