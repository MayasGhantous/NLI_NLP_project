  to spare space & time for the rest of your comment , and your dense questions such as * `` what it means to be ours ? 
  '' * , keep this in mind : ** a ( ny ) country without autochthonous industries , without autochthonous companies , without autochthonous corporations , without autochthonous multinationals , without autochthonous financial giants ** *** ( of native origins , as you might quell on `` what it means to be ours '' ; that 's what ` autochthonous ' means ) *** , ** without ** *** whatever-elses *** ** which constitutes a diversified economy ( a genuine powerhouse economy ) , is & will be on artificial life support because it relies solely on foreign dependencies : the country in question is dead meat , economically , because it does n't exist as long as others do n't fluctuate within its economy since it does n't have its own like others . 
  ** foreign owned entitites are no more , no less , than territorial lend-leased tenants ~ ~ auxiliary businesses , on top of their main products/services ~ ~ which they offer on the market their products & services , * however * , they hold the real economic power , not the country ( the annuitant ) which does n't have its own autochthonous ^ ^ yadda ^ ^ yadda ... 
  the country - which offers itself as a lend-lease territory - is on an artificial , frivolous , life support ; aka . 
  not an actual player , not an actual economic powerhouse , but a banana republic . 
  okay ? 
  ok .  there 's at least 35 pure research institutes in romania not to mention all the universities each with a lot of separate research departments . 
  also there 's a healthy startup market in bucharest and cluj . 
  on life support thanks to foreign bucks * as long as * they kiss ass .

  time to stop sunbathing if we want to know who 's who from where . 
  knowing the arrogance of * `` what , who are you tell me what to do ? 
  '' * , this will never take fruition . 
  yeah , we 're not good at anything else : no autochthonous heavy & light industries , no autochthonous commerce firms , no autochthonous financial giants of our own , no research & innovation institutions , no military industrial-complexes ... just honey export . 
  like a banana republic . 
  makes me sick in the gut , almost vomit . 
  where are the foreign embassies to lecture the italians about this ? 
  you 're welcome . 
  may your first & second-born be the same as you wish upon me , and their offsprings on top of that . 
  this is good news . 
  since the austrian transvestite , i 've come to the conclusion that the less points you have , the saner you are . 
  ah , another useful idiot ... nah , that 's too kind , you 're a brain-dead zombie : 5,1 millions votes for  7,4 million votes against . 
   the romanian constitution requires a turnover of over 50 % to consider the vote for impeaching the president as valid . 
  the turnover was 46 % . 
  16.2 million was recorded as being ~ ~ able ~ ~ eligible to vote , adults as young as 18 years of age . 
  moreover , you 're purposefully ignore * erata * : only in hell and heaven are 22 or 20 of us , total . 
  let 's not forget about those who , at that time , were n't able to vote in great numbers outside the country ( due to great lenghts and distances ) and let 's not forget the minors & dead people considered eligible to vote ( which they are not , but the registered forms at the referendum were otherwise ) . 
  he forgot to thank the dead for his `` winning '' . 
  the only way , in your head and others ' brain-deads , is that we 're * at least * 19.5 million population , and that every one of them are eligible to vote , dead or alive , adults or minors . 
  so much so , that you probalby forgot , he found himself in such a low , degenerate position , that the actual presence at the vote by his useful idiots and brai-dead zombies was a lot more dangerous that the vote itself to protect him . 
  but that 's a fairly unknown nuance to others , is it . 
   ponta and antonescu then attempted to castrate the constitutional court via an emergency government ordinance and changed the referendum law so that the president could be impeached by 50 % +1 of votes regardless of turnover . 
  that 's false . 
  the reasoning behind the 50 % +1 vote is as old as early as 2006-2007 ( for the wrong reasons at that time and discussion ) . 
  moreover , the referendum was n't about removing a mayor or a city/county counselorship , it was about removing a president ( with very grave mental illnesses , since he declared himself winner with 7,4 million punches in the nose ) . 
  for whatever reasons there were , one of them , in terms of eligibility is that it was required at least half the population to remove him ( which happened , but overturned by foreigners ) to justify it accordingly with and in the spirit of the constitution . 
  of course , all it took was a couple of foreign implications to spit on each and every voter who wanted him down . 
  the only ones that decided the referendum was valid were his cronies , that 's it , with zegrean as the spearhead . 
  while the constitution itself is pretty adamant on some issues that happened . 
  interesting how 7,4 million votes are invalid for his removal but 5,1 million for his support are valid as crystal water . 
  just another nuance . 
   it was ponta and antonescu who attempted a coup ( and failed ) , not basescu . 
  show me the guns , explosives and terrorists . 
  too late and he wo n't be in jail . 
  two reasons : 1 - when the referendum for his downfall ( which were 7.4 million votes against him ; the highest ever recorded in this country 's history ; compared with him being elected with just over 5.1 million votes ) was basically overturned - a coup d'etat - with the help from * foreign embassies * and * foreign implications * , and also thanks to his cronies that he handpicked for positions within the justice system . 
  now , as irony , he complains about the current affairs within the justice system which he , himself , helped to create . 
  2 - even after he has retired after his 2nd term , without any surprise , everybody that was around him was , more or less , `` halted '' for corruption , fraud , theft etcetera ( including his brother ) but not all of them , even those whom were `` halted '' were n't booked for actual hearings , actual dossier case , or actual trial for conviction . 
  nothing was made to this day by those whom were hippity-hoppy on preventative arrest/detention ; but it was a lot of tv circus with hand-cuffs , no proofs , no evidence , no nothing ... no actual work from prosecutors ... just some weeks or months spent in a cell and that 's it . 
  you have to prove your innocence ( not the other way around , btw ) and you 're guilty until proven innocent . 
  it has become so stupid , so excessive , and stalinistic , that a lot of people ( indifferent or misinformed on these matters ) *** do not know the difference *** between * a trial court * ( actual trial , actual justice , actual conviction ) & * preventative arrest/detention * ( not actual trial , not actual justice , not actual conviction ; just circus for tv and for morons to believe that `` justice has been served '' ) . 
  to make matters worse , the perception is that mps and senators have this so-called `` immunity from prosecution '' or `` immunity from justice '' . 
  ** they 're not immune from being prosecuted and they 're not immune from serving time in prison , no , they are excepted from these machiavellian-stalinistic preventative arrests and preventative detention . 
  btw , the only person in this country , with absolute immunity from justice , is the president . 
  he can kill someone and not be prosecuted . 
  it 's very rudimentary and very regressive , yes . 
  and this son of a whore , ex-serviceman ( he worked for ceausescu 's * die * ; which was the equivalent of the * cia * or * dia/dcs * ) , has external protection without any shadow of a doubt . 
  that 's why he wo n't be facing the rest of his life behind bars . 
  *** found one of the xenophiles *** you 're one of the reasons why the country is what it is : xenocentrism . 
  instead of getting ourselves up , * leaving * seems more easy .

   in another stinging attack , the presenter said the french government 's decision to fund the study of french in north african nations was akin to a `` form of imperialism '' . 
   he added : `` the truth is that while other imperial powers were running down their flags around the world , france never really decolonised . '' that is pinpoint accurate . 
  both countries have their overseas territories ( islands ) , but there 's a bargain in africa which is ... deplorable . 
   i find it funny how they had to place romanians and gypsies separately ... not that it made a gigantic difference , but hey :d at least you tried guys , at least you tried !, 
  my cynicism tells me this : `` meet the new boss , same as the old boss . '', 
  there 's a difference between tax haven done by officials & tax havens done by bussinesses . 
  otherwise , let 's crack on every major corporation & multinational for tax avoidance that rely on their own consultancy firms . 
  ooops , i forgot ... they can say `` fuck all '' and leave . 
  so , tax havens are n't against the law for businesses . 
  it 's against the law only when officials are doing it . 
  dis goin ' 2 be gut .
