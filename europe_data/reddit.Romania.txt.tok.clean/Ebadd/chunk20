  were there unfortunate bastards bred out of wedlock ? 
  i do n't recall ius primae noctis as being a historical truth . 
   what is the percentage of romanian ancestry does a gypsy needs to have in order to be european ? 
  romanians are n't gypsies , nor gypsies will ever be romanian . 
  period . 
  even if it can boil or freeze , water is n't fire . 
  tell your obscure buddies with foreign first/last names that we are n't like them . 
  on the other hand , i have but to wonder , why are you keen in amalgamating one 's ancestry to push their admittance as europeans ? 
  gypsies have chosen to remain what they are ( culturally , linguistically , traditionally ; and it 's been proved from where ) . 
  i admit , i see in this type of stubbornness some advantages , even if they are whom they are today . 
  are * you * a gypsy ? 
  why are you ashamed , why correlate with us ? 
  be proud : your ancestors were so stubborn from integrating ( not only here , in europe as well centuries ago ) . 
   the migratory tribes played a minor role ? 
  one branch of the goths came in the territory long before the austro-hungarian empire . 
  what are the goths ? 
  because if we 're talking about celts too , then we 're into a spiral , and i think you know where that will lead . 
   in romania , gypsies used to be slaves for romanians that held land . 
  they call consumerism an '' economic expansion '' , and if we 're talking about ( re ) building the economy , the answer is always '' foreign investment ( s ) '' . 
  it does n't matter what you meant . 
  if you 're talking about gypsies , you should n't . 
  they 're a minority that , sadly , ceausescu did n't thought of letting them loose . 
  they 're not our responsibility . 
  if you 're talking about romanian ex-patriots , you should count yourself lucky , they have a xenophiliac mindset . 
  like judas , they 'd gladly sell for 30 pieces of silver and be called an austrian than a romanian . 
  do n't worry , we do n't want them either , you can have 'em . 
  the main problems are these : \\  integration means that those people will have to renounce at their former traditions & identity . 
  if they want to integrate , they 'll have to abandon anything that has to do with tribalistic tendencies & nuances of their past lives . 
  believe me , this social hurricane will take its toll on western europe . 
  they think that minorities are so awe-struck by western culture & civilisation , that they 'd gladfully renounce at their own traditions , culture & tongue to integrate without ... let 's say ... `` impositions '' from the native 's establishment . 
  what a lie , what a disgratious lie . 
  the most visible aspect will be nepotism : promoting themselves whenever they can into position of power or in such a way to financial self-sustenance ( ergo favoritism ) , while retaining their identity , not as new zealanders , but as minorities or `` i 'm a new zealander of * < insert background ethnicity  * '' . 
  \\  if people scream `` persecution '' or `` minority rights violation '' , then they 're against integration/assimilation & it 's an issue . 
  this is a twist they like to do . 
  they blame their life choices , ignorance or perceived disadvantages onto the natives . 
  the moment they see weakness or free-hand , they 'll abuse the shit out of it . 
  if you cave in , they 'll bite and chew for more ; then , you 'll wonder why your economy is such under financial strains from social programs or welfare programs . 
  \\  afterwards , there 's the loyalty & integrity problem . 
  they 'll say things such as `` as a new zealander * < insert minority designation  * , i. . . '' just to appease the natives and majority , but make no mistake , everyone is a suspect . 
  it 's been known that romania suffers from corruption but as of late , some ( thankfully ) are starting to ponder some interesting questions , like * `` how many minorities through their romanian citizenship , not ethnically romanian , are contributing to corruption ? 
  how many statistics have falsely said that romanians are corrupted above their ears , however , they did n't considered looking into if the corruption cases included minorities with romanian citizenship ? '' * . 
  would you deny the fact that minorities in your country will develop this sense of self-preservation and no integration whatsoever ? 
  i 'd bet without hesitation , and that 's a problem you 'll need to counter . 
  some falsely equate citizenship with nationality & this addresses a potential problem that you can face . 
  that 's why i 've always said that citizenship is a privilege , not a right . 
  nepotism , favoritism & tribalistic tendencies by minorities that could scream about so-called `` minority rights violation '' if you question their integrity . 
  this will happen . 
   i go to a pretty diverse school in hamilton and regularly talk to and engage with indians , chinese , somalis etc etc. 
  and all are pretty nice people , the somalis i talked to fit in well , so i thought `` why do n't european immigrants fit in well '' , perhaps its the points-based system we have , perhaps it 's because the ministry of immigration mixes them with the local population . 
  i mean it ca n't be that much better to the european model , 71,000 people came in this year and it has n't really caused a stir . 
  chinese immigrants fit in here exceptionally well too . 
  never underestimate a smile : everybody can fake one just to appease . 
  do not hesitate for one minute that none of them would n't gladly help each other ( within their group ) , while the majority of you new zealanders argue pitiful discussions . 
  that 's how mafias or cartels form : tribalistic in nature aiming at self-preservation . 
  all that sweet talk that they 're ` new ' new zealanders will be a lie to fool you . 
  what 's the worth of integration if minorities will still adopt a mindset of self-preservation ? 
  in what sense ? 
  yeah , those tributes . 
  wonder where all those genes went to ... 
  the better question is , are europeans similar with a portion of the turks , or the turks are similar to europeans ? 
  with that , i 'll let you ponder why . 
   the point is that those companies still invest a lot of money in romania your point is vague & will turn miserable for people . 
  investment = / = charity , angel investors . 
  i 've written it before , i 'll continue to write it for as long as it offshore companies , corporations and multinationals exist looking for cheap manpower and cheap subcontractors that are n't paying the equitable amount they 'd pay in their home country . 
  ask anybody why they would n't ask for a pay raise , despite working a lot more hours ( overtime ) or that they would n't gather as a whole and ask that . 
  ahh , correct , because companies threaten to leave the country since offshore businesses ( or fdis ) , by their design & mission , are looking for the cheapest ( free no pay slavery , if possible ) workforce . 
  then , the natives glam and swear at the government and parliament , evolving a weird , toxic , mix of stockholm syndrome . 
  *  they pay wages yes , wages , they pay bigger wages * outside * & a heck of a lot more in their home country . 
  is it reasonable ? 
  while in here , it 's ... 1/10th ( putting it lightly ) in comparison ? 
  good to know that cheap workforce design is working ... * for them * ... while here they have the perfect stockholm syndrome herd to exploit . 
   and pay taxes at the very least indirectly . 
  '' at the very least '' ?!? 
  none of them are paying taxes ( they 're glad to commit tax avoidance , which is cooking the books , which is financial-fiscal fraud ) , their employers paying * their * taxes is n't the same as a corporation or multinational paying their ( '' direct '' ) taxes !, 
  there is no such thing as '' paying taxes indirectly '' ; you 're either paying taxes or you 're committing fiscal crime . 
  such a marvelous arrogance you 're displaying here , filled with double standards : in the west ( ` specially america , they wo n't dare fuck with sammy ) they pay their taxes '' directly '' , while in romania i 'm supposed to learn that they must n't pay taxes because their ` mouthpieces ' say they '' pay indirect taxes '' . 
  rejection !, 
  everybody 's paying their share , they too must . 
  either nobody pays taxes or somebody is committing financial-fiscal crime . 
  the latter is in force , therefore , they 're committing a fiscal crime . 
   fdi 's are never a bad thing . 
  not when they are n't following the rules just like the rest of us . 
  what a disgusting & magnificent , oblivious , double standard you 're presenting : everybody complains when city councils , mayors , representatives , political parties etc are suspect of stealing money or laundering money , corruption and the whole package ; * while on the other hand * , foreign entities are acclaimed for not paying taxes , cooking the books , syphoning outside & report false small numbers . 
  such arrogant insolence & impudence on their part . 
   that 's how countries like singapore , hong kong or south korea got to where they are today . 
  how about you drop the condescending act of thinking you know better than me , hm ? 
  hong kong is not a country while you ( yes , * you * frost ) have some deep misguided , deep misinformed , beliefs to list me a couple of asian geopolitical entities for several reasons : 1 - they do not , nor claim , to uphold western values . 
  2 - singapore & south korea have mandatory military service . 
  * ( good luck with that , btw ) * 3 - hong kong is n't what you think they are anymore , as years have passed . 
  i do n't care what your old people around you told you out the tip of their head , stick with the times . 
  4 - take them each : [ hong kong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_of_hong_kong ) , [ singapore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_of_singapore ) , and [ south korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_of_south_korea ) . 
  now , browse through all of them ( mind you , it 'll take some time , and be careful on details ) and let me know how many of them have a high number of domestic businesses , corporations , and multinationals that can keep up with fdis . 
  * hong kong is more a grey area since 1997 . 
  * then , compare it to us . 
  see any difference ? 
  if you do n't , come back when you 're done looking , and read it * from this point * unless you do n't observe it : they have autochthonous ( aka . 
  native ) firms , companies , corporations , and multinationals . 
  all of those domestic businesses were n't sprung from fdis . 
  this is probably the most important characteristic , available to every nation that is to be considered a regional or continental power ; that xenophiliacs are kowtowing with such nonchalant & disgrace . 
  ( modern willful helots )  when a multinational invests 50 million euros in romania for example , that means a whole lot of jobs for construction firms , the people they directly employ , providers and other companies which are a cog in their machine .
