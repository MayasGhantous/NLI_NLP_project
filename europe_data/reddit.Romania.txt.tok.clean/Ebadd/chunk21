  re-read my first three segments above , there is n't any more that can be said about this debunked myth . 
  no country , in this world , ever became a powerhouse ( much less engaged in nation building or rebuilding ) with somebody else 's money & interest without sacrificing something important in return . 
  the first and foremost rule of capitalism & trade is and remains : ownership & control , private or public , domestic or foreign . 
  in a self-respectable country , everything is put forth for domestic ownership & control , not fdi . 
  alas , i return to complain about xenophiles and xenophilia . 
  is that the reason why you 'll never blame bechtel for not building those damned highway or microsoft in that case ( '' \u00cen dosarul microsoft , lipse\u0219te microsoft '' ) , just to name a few examples ? 
   the benefit for the economy is very real with or without paying taxes on profits . 
  temporary benefit is n't definitive benefit , they can leave at whim so long as the plantationers do not dare mumble about overtime payment , equitable wages ( as to their home country ) , wage raises or raise concern over their dastard influence in our administrations & politics . 
  they 're foreign-owned , nor domestic-owned , and that poses an existential problem * for us * . 
  the fact that you ignore that just because you repeat yourself '' they 're foreigners , they would never dare harm us '' is why people like you are the problem , alongside with their unjust practices . 
  taxes on profit , vat ( this is more applied on wages , though , not a foreign corporation 's or multinational 's bill ) , * and * *** revenues *** . 
  they cook the books on their profits ( no surprise there ) to hide in offshore havens , committing financial fraud . 
  very well , then , let 's adopt * hollywood accounting * mentality , if that 's the case . 
  do n't get me started with it not paying their share , yet they expect everybody else to do it in their stead . 
  u/anarchisto just so you can read this too . 
  how many taxes are they paying , after cooking the books and syphoning the rest outside ? 
  foreign-owned companies , corporations ( + those cooked books about profits ) = / = romania 's *** actual *** economy you do n't do nation ( re ) building with somebody else 's assets and interests . 
  investments are n't charities , they expect a return , a shareholding . 
  any particular genre that you recall ? 
  what contest ? 
  you would n't have said that if your country did n't won a single contest . 
  aah , yes , the silk road . 
  i was surprised by a completely different factor/reason of this photo . 
  xenophiles are n't our `` compatriots '' . 
  they 're ` nouveaux ' italians , french , spanish ... 
  ... or maybe it 's all a ruse with the impression of vulnerability just so to honeytrap further attacks from foreign entities , while these '' rogue '' hackers do this job in the meantime . 
  the title is cute . 
  powerhouses have three-acronym agencies for cases like these if there 's a serious need . 
  yes http://www.hiberniaforum.ie/germany-france-run-eu-rest-pavilion-members/, 
  where did i paint n\u0103stase as a victim ? 
  i said he had bigger baggage ( legitimate ones that could 've handed him at least 20 years in prison ) , yet they charged him in a kangaroo court with garden gnomes , for 2 years ( and not even those served fully , i believe ) . 
  baldy deserves to be tortured to death by any means of the human imagination for what he 's done to the country . 
  see the person on junker 's right ? 
  he was the ex-prime minister , he was convicted in a kangaroo court for ridiculous charges ( something that had to do with garden gnomes , despite having heavier baggage ) , he shot himself in the neck , survived , did time in prison for 2 years , and now being side by side with the person that orchestrated his character assassination . 
  amusing that the '' justice system '' did n't convicted him on some more heavier charges , instead , they used garden gnomes . 
  just to show what a horrible photo this is . 
  still , i 'd rather see baldy behind bars for the rest of his life . 
  the photo is disgusting , with juncker kissing him . 
  everyone that lived in romania under b\u0103sescu as president ... it 's cynical and can be seen a lot why b\u0103sescu has immunity from outside and not inside prison . 
  v\u0103d c\u0103 b\u0103sismul n-a murit , varianta expatriat\u0103 ...  one of the reasons i left romania was because of the constant anti-basescu bashing . 
  good riddance !, 
   i believe he was a good president that did many good things to stabilize the economy and to promote economic growth . 
  experiencing the economic crisis from afar does n't make your point valid . 
   the dna ( national anti-corruption agency ) exists because he promoted it and protected it from political influences . 
  dna was invented by psd . 
   and protected it from political influences . 
  by making it a political tool , along with the secret services , and protecting his orange party , associates , family & others . 
   i think in 20-30 years time popular opinion will change once people understand politics more . 
  thank providence that you will be wrong , only a small disillusioned portion will hold him on a pedestal , just like ceausescu is ( though , in comparison , ceausescu did more ) . 
  u/tangojager  one thing that made him lose a lot of support was the moment he announced himself the fact wages will be reduced by 25 % , to avoid economic crash and speed up recovery from the 2008-2009 world crisis . 
  the measure was seen as pretty brutal at the time and even tougher than what the imf recommended . 
  no , he and his government was hated *** for refusing to listen *** to the imf at the time , as [ dominique strauss-kahn . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poc4addmdd8 ) put it . 
  why did he do , instead ? 
  cutting wages , while other european countries did n't cut through the bone marrow . 
  ah , yes , and enriching his friends , his family , and their families ( $ 20 billions poof ) , while the rest of the population was buckling the belt beyond guts . 
  he did n't sped nothing , he did nothing , saying that '' the economic crisis wo n't reach us '' , only to do a u-turn and contradict himself ( as usual ) . 
   he did recover a bit of his popularity the moment psd tried to abusively impeach him based on bullshit political claims . 
  cronyism , favoritism , protection for his associates , abuse of power , using the secret services as his political weapons , illegal-unconstitutional wiretappings , political-led kangaroo justice against his opponents are '' bullshit political claims '' ? 
   he was once again put in a position of confrontation in which he thrieved , as the underdog and people took his side as they usually empathize with the victim of perceived injustice . 
  way to go violating the constitution ( for a millionth time ) for not being above n ' beyond political parties . 
  '' bullshit political claims '' ...  after he finished the second term , something changed . 
  yeah , he was n't in power anymore at the helm of a [ mafia state ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pitnrxil_cg ) . 
  * edit * * for those wondering , in the recording , he 's mocking how the secret services and a woman prosecutor ( that was given the boot recently ; too little , too late ) orchestrated the arrest of a [ judge ] ( https://www.luju.ro/dezvaluiri/cazuri-celebre/condamnare-pentru-nesupunere-din-spatele-gratiilor-judecatorul-stan-mustata-acuza-ca-a-fost-inchis-pentru-ca-n-a-vrut-sa-l-faca-pe-langa-lege-pe-dan-voiculescu-executat-intr-un-final-de-cuplul-camelia-bogdan-alexandru-mihai-mihalcea-am-zis-doar-ca-trebuie?pdf ) because b\u0103sescu had a problem with him , and how the former chief of the internal secret service were going to do the bust against along with dna ( a clear breach of the constitution between agencies and integrity of the so-called justice system ) . 
  *  then changed his mind and built a new party who he led ( made it in the parliament ) for his whore . 
   then he suddenly announced he gives up on his position as the leader of the party . 
  yeeaaaaaahh , keen to let go of party leadership , but not so keen to leave his position at the chamber of deputies * before * leaving party leadership , since he 's so ` worried ' that the youth should take charge . 
   he had a few investigations open on his name or in connection with close family members , some more serious , some obvious bad jokes ( political games , usually initiated by psd members ) . 
  till this point , most of the investigations were closed and did n't find him guilty . 
  we 'll see in time what happens with the rest of them . 
  that 's because he has protection from outside , everybody knows it . 
  the flota dossier , the mihaileanu house case , omar hayssam case , his connection with his brother 's bribes from gypsies are a lot more obvious than a full moon , just to name a few ; nevermind his daughter and money from other bribes from different sources of interest ( such as [ gazprom ] ( http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/de-la-rusi-vin-banii-ioana-basescu-notarul-agreat-de-gazprom-in-tranzactiile-efectuate-in-romania-659059.html ) or that [ lukoil ] ( https://www.bzi.ro/rusii-de-la-lukoil-principalii-sponsori-ai-campaniei-lui-basescu-din-2009-460584 ) was one of his sponsors ... damned the russian oligarchs , but not their dough , huh ? ) . 
  speaking of one of his daughters , what about his daughter ( a notary public from an obscure isolated location in the country , just to point out how successful she was at making lots of money ) getting that humongous loan from [ cec ( and just to mention brd for no reason ) ] ( http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/liuba-alexandrescu-notarita-penala-din-ferma-presedintelui-cumnata-pdl-psd-655889.html ) ( and a more [ detailed list ] ( http://www.bankingnews.ro/cec-bank-credit-ioana-basescu.html ) ) to buy that farm ? 
  amazing what benefits and privileges she got , besides those deals with foreign companies establishing in the country , but big loans that no other persons in the country ( not to mention other notaries , just like her ) could get . 
  it 's not like daddy had any influence or interest in buying that farm , no ? 
  '' bullshit political claims '' , '' political games , usually initiated by psd '' ...  fact is he lost a lot of popularity again , even among his hardcore supporters , in the past months , when to their shock they noticed he was silent about the abusive psd decrees trying to legalize corruption and free those jailed for corruption . 
  gee , they were really that amazed ? 
  they 're that decayed ? 
  zombies ... or morons ... or both , decayed moron zombies . 
  what was it ? 
  '' the pot calling the kettle black '' ? 
  here 's a thing , he admits that dna made ( and still makes ) a lot of abuses ( even during his time as president , which makes it the more cynically nerving , it if were n't such a tragedy we 'd be laughing ) . 
  by all means , that circus we had what just that : a circus . 
  preventative arrest does n't mean that the person arrested ( even though they were proving nothing ) is guilty by default ( whatever happened with presumption of innocence ? 
  ) , that 's just the propaganda that kissed him during his 10 years tenure as president ( and still some ass-lickers here n ' there ) . 
  flashy noises , a lot of them acquitted , many of them at oecd , '' thanks '' to judges & prosecutors that are immune from responsibility for their abusise , uninterested , actions & lack of evidence . 
   if you add the fact he 's been using every occasion in the past few months to attack dna and kovesi , working together with the government party ( his former biggest enemy ) and their propaganda outlets that he could n't stand in the past , you can understand why a lot of his supporters distanced themselves from him . 
  he was one of the few hopes of making a strong and effective opposition to the party in power , in the parliament , but he chose to let the people in the street do the entire opposition on their own . 
  it 's obvious that he is either afraid he 'll get convicted for something or more likely he tries to protect close ones ( one of his daughters ) or free from jail the close ones convicted till this point ( his brother , his former confident ) . 
  hahahahahahahaha, 
  why , was she offered a medal from the swedes ? 
  did she protected ikea from being investigated for tax evasion ? 
  why are you awake at 3 am ? 
  like chirac and sarkozy * after * they left ? 
  like chirac and sarkozy * after * they left ? 
  immune from prosecution is one of biggest '' gobshite '' i 've seen at a president . 
  so , hypothetically , the french president can kill , torture , steal , murder , rape , & blackmail without being prosecuted for it . 
  tl ; dr. do n't forget [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68txcv/in_2016_more_romanian_children_were_born_in/dh3dolg/?context=3 ) as another reason why citizenship is n't a right when ex-romanians abuse it , like how you want to . 
  you hate your own country and countrymen & that 's why you 're preaching the choir to the deserters . 
  their offspring do not deserve zilch ( no citizenship , no land , no nothing anymore ) .
