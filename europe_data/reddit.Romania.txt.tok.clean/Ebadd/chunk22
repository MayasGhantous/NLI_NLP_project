  let 's not forget the reason of gateways : it 's not a secret that corrupt people buy offshore property to reside when they 're done pillaging or in case something wrong happens & they get busted . 
  gee ... just like those cheap dirt manpower deserters ... yet another reason why citizenship is n't a right , it is a privilege . 
  i 'm not a troll . 
  did i stutter ? 
  i do n't care that you find these obvious truths ( that you 're not capable of admitting ) as mild infuriating inconveniences . 
   i do n't disagree with you , i just have n't found yet a good source where it proves that it is erronous . 
  they send money to their relatives , not the government . 
  they pay taxes and levies to foreign governments ' coffers , not the romanian government 's coffers . 
  one of the most sleazy excuse that is easily debunked :   `` but they pay money to their relatives which , in turn , pay to the government '' their relatives pay * their * share as citizens that remained in the country , not them that left the country that continue to send money to their relatives . 
  their relatives = / = them . 
  their relatives pay their share of taxes & levies ( just like the rest of us living in the country ) , however , * they * pay taxes & levies to the foreign country they reside in . 
  ------------------------------------- \\  john smith lives in australia . 
  \\  john smith 's relatives live in britain . 
  \\  john smith sends money to his relatives in britain . 
  \\  by british law , john smith 's relatives are obliged to pay taxes & levies to the british government ( '' ... death and taxes '' ) . 
  \\  by australian law , john smith is obliged to pay taxes & levies to the australian government . 
  \\  john smith , pretending to still be a british citizen , is n't paying * his * share of taxes & levies to the british government , the same way his relatives are doing . 
  \\  although john smith , a british citizen , pays taxes & levies to the australian government , he does n't pay taxes & levies * on his behalf as a british citizen * that he continues to pretend to be . 
  \\  when john smith sent money to his relatives , he did so thinking helping his family , not paying his share of taxes & levies to the government . 
  \\  if john smith 's relatives paid * their * taxes & levies with the money that john smith sent them is ** pure conjecture ** , since john smith still does n't pay * his * share of taxes & levies as a british citizen . 
  -------------------------------- reasonably understandable . 
  the only possible reason ` john smith ' * would not * or * does n't want * to understand this means he either does n't give a shit about his obligations as a citizen of his country of origin * or * he 's an asshole that does n't deserve to be called british anymore . 
  which reminds me ... ** hey ** , u/bitchshutupandlisten !, 
  here 's yet *** another reason *** why citizenship is a privilege *** and not a right *** !, 
   i too hurt when people chose the `` easy way out '' , instead of staying here and trying to fix their country . 
  exactly what i 've said in my long commentary : they 're disloyal with a mercenary mentality , expecting others to sweat & drop blood in other to change the country . 
  they 're no different than the corrupt folk obsessed with money and power . 
   however , you have to understand that we need those people more than ever . 
  never associate yourself with deserters , giorgos . 
  the rest of the world will laugh behind your backs for how weak you present yourself to the unscrupuled . 
  they 're the by-product of cosmopolitanism , globalisation & xenophilia are . 
  remember , reminds this everybody you know , and take it to your grave : your political class , your businessmen , bankers , military officers & entrepreneurs preferred to establish businesses outside of greece , withhold offshore accounts , and drive a pyramid scheme of endless spending for the benefit of foreigners . 
  now , when they 've let your country in such a deplorable situation , they decided to eject outside . 
  do n't tell me you want to associate yourself , in any way , shape or form , with these judases and their 30 silvers . 
   instead of steering them away , we should welcome them with open arms . 
  forgiveness/opened arms is between them and god ... 
  did i stutter ? 
  change your flair to old glory . 
   one thing i 'm happy i got away from : people like you . 
  the feeling is mutual . 
  enjoy and good riddance . 
   you 're giving the disease as the cure in some weird fucked up way . 
  cures were made out of diseases . 
   honestly , let 's end this here because we will definitely not agree . 
  the idea that citizenship is a privilege is something i completely disagree with . 
  you did n't proved otherwise and it 's understandable why you 're stubborn to admit you 're wrong ( as a matter of fact , the country has so many difficulties because people do n't admit when they are wrong , such as yourself ) . 
  it 's a privilege , first and foremost , when it can become available to foreign-born individuals . 
  the fact that you hold [ romanian ] citizenship to such a low status , similar to produce in kiosks and supermarkets , shows that you are contributing to problems . 
   but they can not due to the laws of that country not allowing it . 
  middle east does n't claim to uphold western values . 
  since you brought that up , it is proving why citizenship is a privilege rather than a human right . 
   and that can discriminate them ( look at the trump country ban ) . 
  i do n't care what others do with their countries & you 're pumping up cosmopolitan , globalist , and xenophiliac rhetoric to back your affirmations which , in case you do n't realise , are altogether another reason why citizenship is a privilege . 
  universalism is incompatible with citizenship . 
   since people can not freely choose their citizenship in this world ( since they are born into it ) , nor can they be born without a citizenship usually , as far as i am concerned citizenship is definitely a right , sometimes even a burden , and very rarely a privilege . 
  [ it is n't a right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statelessness ) and since they can be given citizenship , they can be stripped away from it just as quick . 
  privilege , not right . 
  it is cynical & asinine on your part to protect people that have no more common ground with the country instead of focusing on our country ... unless , of course , you 're an expat that have abandoned the country . 
  you are the reason why the country does n't have a stand anymore and why everything is deplorable as it is right now : because corruption , besides nepotism , favoritism & blackmail , involves one 's disgust with their country and establishing gateways to evade . 
  that 's how expatriates did it and that 's why they do n't deserve anything , anymore , with romania . 
   if they care enough to vote then they probably deserve the right , i do n't want them to vote for my future , in the fatherland , that they have no more business with . 
  it 's reasonable understanding . 
   but do you see people who maybe never stepped in romania go stay in line to vote for corrupt unknown politicians ? 
  i do n't know why you 're asking me this or allude to , it 's offtopic . 
  be a good sport and do n't denigrate my country 's flag , change it appropriately to old glory . 
  nighty-night , american . 
   as i said , some will still care about romania , it will always be part of their being , some will want to come back , maybe not to live but to see their origins . 
  what they '' feel '' vs the reality of the circumstances . 
  i do n't care for their sentiments , they are figuratively dead ( even the parents of these newborns ) . 
  oh , nor the political parties , government & agencies must n't care . 
   you should never take parts out of people by force , taking their citizenship away it will be exactly that . 
  they are the ones that left . = , nobody forced them to leave , it was their own personal choice . 
  choices that come with benefits ( new home , new country , new culture , new mindset , new opportunities , social security etc ) and sacrifices ( renouncing citizenship for them and their offsprings , defund/defunct/eliminate programs to maintain relationships with these people , no rights of return ) . 
   it is a reason we have a right by blood for that thing !, 
  because they to have our blood , our entity in them . 
  and it will be in them , even not as strong to make them idiotically nationalistic , but ti will be there !, 
  blood is n't anything ( you sound like an eugenics freak ) . 
  you do n't deserve what you decide to throw away . 
  understand this : i do n't condemn * why * they ~ ~ left ~ ~ abandoned the country ( it 's their choice , that 's freedom ) but we have serious , grave , problems since they associate with us when , in actuality , they have no more connections with us . 
  they 're no longer romanians , i 've written why . 
   and no one has the right to take that away !, 
  it 's their right !, 
  citizenship is a privilege , not a right . 
  cosmopolitanism , globalization , and xenophilia demonstrated that . 
   the country itself benefits a lot from the money sent back by those working outside of it . 
  that 's a very erroneous , false , assessment and it has been debunked many times . 
  stop using/believe it because there is n't any inherent help in that and you 're doing a lot of misinformation . 
  good riddance , i say . 
   have romanian citizenship , they must n't . 
  neither voting rights . 
  le pen will win the first round . 
  '' television made the idiot its mascot . 
  the internet made the idiot its spokesperson . '' is that how he put it ? 
  blue it is !, 
  if it 's far more complicated than it appears and you think you might lose the screws , you can melt certain parts of the doll with the glue gun or use a screwdriver , grab one-two screws , one-two structural nuts , and one-two structural washers ( optional ) . 
  depends how much you need of each and how you can handle everything . 
  you 'll have to spare an hour or two , maybe less . 
  open or crack open the doll , remove the device & throw in the garbage ( though i suggest you give it to your kid to destroy it with a hammer or destroy it yourself ) , * drill/melt/forcefully screw with the screwdriver * into the doll 's frontal side of the torso and its read ( or sideways if you want to do it that way ) - i suggest making a second hole just to be sure for sturdiness , not right next to the first hole but in a different place - , use that screw , structural nut & structural washer ( optional , you may not need it ) , and you 'll have the torso back together . 
  it depends on you if one hole or two holes are enough to keep the doll whole without breaking apart . 
  if you think two holes are n't enough , you might need to do a third hole .
