  then , you buy a third screw , structural nut and/or structural washer . 
  why not remove & throw the device and keep the doll ? 
  two choices , three scenarios . 
  choice # 1 . 
  allow at eu legislative level for political parties based on ethnic , racial , and minority interests to operate . 
  choice # 2 . 
  do not allow at eu legislative level for political parties based on ethnic , racial , and overall cultural backgrounds , to operate . 
  scenario # 1 . 
  continental powder keg v3 .0 scenario # 2 . 
  it was fun while it lasted but no political parties based on narrow interests will ever break any country or have a say at national or eu level ( s ) . 
  it was a cutesy idea for villainous people with power , money & influence to disturb other countries with various dumb tensions & distractions ( most commonly inter-ethnic tensions ) that did more harm than good , ever . 
  scenario # 3a . 
  after april 7th , it wo n't matter anymore because the eu will dissolve . 
  scenario # 3b . 
  after april 7th , it matters because nobody ceased to exist . 
  riiight , but what you and u/littlerecordings are saying is n't simple , is it ? 
  people ~ ~ need ~ ~ want change now , overnight , not after 3-4 years sitting on their elbows in faculty bench tables , correct ? 
  dissertations ... not everyone wants or has the patience or capable of going all the way for a degree just to change jobs because their previous one is dying out ( though , i ca n't imagine how metallurgy will ever fade out , if ever ) to earn money for a comfortable life after being told '' tough luck '' . 
  anybody care to explain [ ** this ** ] ( http://imgur.com/4mtrjgz ) ? 
  [ removed ], 
   not to say the more i learn about the regulations the more it feels like shackles to local business in favor of large multinational corporations . 
  '' privatise '' , they said ... 
  how did winston got caught if not through surveillance ? 
  at least you did n't lost 45 years worth of generations under the hammer & sickle . 
  remember this : profit = / = revenue = / = divident cross one , they 'll use the other two . 
  you can never really predict the expansionist expedition . 
  a normal country does n't listen to others ' advice how to govern itself , not selling the industry to scrap nor let it be privatised by foreign entities without conditions imposed , and last but not least , never sell exploitation rights when your citizenry wo n't benefit from those exploitations . 
  in a normal country , no politician upholds the lamentations of their family or partners for quick bucks to buy expensive objects . 
   the way to go would be to become a member of the party stay sharp , your designated political party has assured itself 8 more years of [ domination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominant-party_system ) . 
  i ca n't see through other people via a [ monitor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ) , lately . 
  conjunctures . 
  as long as your problem with them is '' they 're not like the * others * in country * x * '' , you 'll never vote for anybody , even though by namesake & principles , they 're social democrats for someone like you who identifies as a social democrat . 
  still social democrats by definition . 
  making comparisons defeats the purpose of principles . 
   social democrat   [ i 'm also sad i have no one to vote for in romania . 
  ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/partidul_social_democrat_ ( rom % c3 % a2nia ) ), 
  if we 're not in charge , then i see no reason to be interested in ghost stories reenaction . 
  i do n't . 
   at this point might as well let me choose if i want a gloriosus roman empire . 
  do you ? 
   anyway , welcome to my `` state '' ( not really a state ) of anarcho-democracy i think it 's called '' georgism '' but i might be wrong . 
   there are a lots of very smart romanians in romania or working abroad . 
  the press does n't talk about them , they only want to talk about criminals who make up a small precentege of the romanians abroad . 
  their ` smarts ' drop in freefall when they lament why the country develops so slow , since they 've chosen to abandon it . 
  i detest hypocrisy , arrogant hypocrisy much more . 
   we are developing . 
  maybe more slowly than others , maybe even more slowly than other ee countries , but we are . 
  we still have a long way to go , but we did n't get the head start we did . 
  there 's no country , of the history of humankind , that '' developed '' using other people 's money without giving something vital in return ( privatisations , exploitation rights for natural resources ; y' know , vital-fatal decisions ... ) * or * listening to what they say religiously without doubting them ( even a little ) that they might want to screw you in the process . 
  we will never develop with others ' assets . 
  never . 
  due to the inferiority complex , we 'll never surpass france , germany , italy & the uk combined ( what a fantasy though , right ? ) . 
  do n't get me started with looking at others and copy + paste their ... whatever ... 
  nothing fancy , nothing hipster or trendy , just casual clothes worn by a normal human being that is disinterested by current mainstream clothes , mores or counter-mores . 
  you mean as on the go ? 
  home-made lunch or buy pastry or something else ( most likely fast food ) . 
  pretentious pricks that ca n't live their lives without fantasizing dictating over others ( i do n't mean politically ; think of social pressure , hive mind , types of unhealthy influence ) ; though , communism fell way over 20 years ago , i expected change . 
  all of that usually comes with a xenophiliac mindset and , more than often , a degenerate idiosyncrasy of mixing the native tongue with english , butchering the tongue . 
  at least you can tell apart degenerates from normal people . 
  kinda cold ; it 's windy , yesterday and the day before it rained cats & dogs . 
  i never used insincerity . 
  these are catchphrases , right ( ? 
  ) , since they 're used interchangeably for good , bad or falsehood . 
  that i bother with things . 
  too complex and , frankly , i do n't have the nerves with me right now . 
  yes . 
  i think it 's considered a woman 's drink . 
  same with ginger beer . 
  phanariotes . 
  * i * honestly do not care . 
  if * you * truly care about yourself , you must n't care what others think of you because , as life has put it , everybody that might instill their own version about you ( weak , incompetent , lambasted ... ) , it could & will turn a lot more lethal than good . 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------- for example ... * we * 've been told that if we liberalise our market , we 're going to be fine . 
  10-15 years later , there are more foreign companies than autochthonous ones , our indsutry gone , our cultural capital long immigrated . 
  we can not sponsorise our own ( think of an economic , long-term , plan to create huge private enterprises , not nationalising them or under government influence , just make them native-owned ) due to eu anti-favoritism , anti-protectionist policies . 
  we 've lost that battle forever , for as long as the eu exists . 
  my xenocentric conationals are oblivious and will never want to ( or do n't want to - pay attenttion to small details like these ) advance further than going into another nation to work , never to rebuild our economy . 
  we 've been told to give gypsies a chance , attention , and look 20-15 years later : the same countries , that preached us about tolerance and patience , want gypsies out of their countries . 
  quite a cynical irony , is n't it . 
  now , we can not evade the gypsy sterotype due to the hellish , erroneous , * romani * - * romanian * semantic conflagration . 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it 's your country , your future , your nephews and grandnephews ' future , but for whatever that 's holy and rational to consider , ** never ** look for others ' advice or * `` how do i look '' * opinions because they will *** never *** want you to flourish . 
  ffs , you 're british , you 've fought half the continent , and now you expect them to give you honest , good-hearted , advice and opinions for what 's best for you ? 
  laughable . 
  you want germans to give you positive advice on how to flourish outside or inside the union , after you 've fought two world wars against them ? 
  or the americans , after they 've kneeled your empire after the suez crisis ? 
  you expect russians to genuinely care about you , after more than half of their crooked bussinessmen bought houses and stocks in your economy , in order to whitewash their ill-gotten wealth ? 
  really , you 're open for criticism , as if this is a movie or a british soap opera/drama/comedy ??? 
  ca n't you , and others like you , see the dumbfoundedness and lack of logic & rationale , when you 're asking for opinions and advice or , worse , give credit to others ' opinions/advice just because they 've opened their mouths ? 
  fuck opinions , fuck advice , do whatever you want but do n't do it with half a heart ( whether out or in ) just because you 've heard the opinions of jean-pierre , adolf muller , roberto pastrami , rafael gonzalez , richard taylor , ivan ivansky , and other colourful clowns . 
  if you 'll do it with a half of heart , just because you 've opened your ears to what others comment , you 'll only have doubts , regrets * after * the referendum . 
  there are four things you 'll have to consider , regardless of results : firstly , do not transform cameron , or his conservative successor , into chamberlain 2.0 secondly - as an alternative to the 1st - , do not transform corbyn or his labour inner party members into atlee 2.0 thirdly , whatever you do to osborne or his successor , do n't amalgamate that position like it happened under butler and eden . 
  because either way , in-or-out , it 'll still be messy ( even the designation of it is perverted and an innuendo for sex ) . 
  if you 're in , they 'll kick & squeeze you so bad that you 'll never try this ever again . 
  if you go out , at least you 'll have to fend off and not have to endure inner , inhuman , prussian-style , discipline , but you 'll still have to make wave for incoming punches . 
   how was it helpful ? 
  to the south , we had the ottoman influence . 
  to the east , we had the slavic/russian influence . 
  and to the north-northwest , we had the [ austro - ] hungarian influence . 
  dangerously close to ethnocide , respectively genocide , on all fronts . 
   to me it looks like that romanian intellectuals just wanted to feel like they are high cultured and above everyone else the romanian intellectuals studied abroad , mostly in france , when their peers & nation were surrounded by enemies . 
  it was another way to create relations & influence , when everywhere we 've looked , others wanted us simply ... erased ...
