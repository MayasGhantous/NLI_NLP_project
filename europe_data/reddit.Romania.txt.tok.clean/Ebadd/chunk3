  george carlin : * we come from that northern european , basically the northern european genes , the blue eyes . 
  those blue eyes . 
  boy everybody in the world learned real quick , did n't they ? 
  when those blue eyes sail out of the north , you better nail everything down . 
  nail it down , strap it down , or they 'll grab it . 
  if they ca n't take it home , they 'll burn it . 
  if they ca n't burn it , they 'll * *** fuck *** * it . 
  yeah ... we must ban knives , those are more threatening . 
  yeah ... but , still , fuck gun laws , amirite ?

  from the article itself , quote : * `` they told the court how they used their influence to get the government to approve the purchase of the microsoft license in 2009 , and how they got fees from the people interested in having the contracts go through . 
  '' * in order words , the deal was made due to microsoft agreeing to the price & bribe itself , otherwise , the transaction itself , the whole of it , would n't have been made possible in the first place without agreeing to the price/laundering . 
  so fucking evident , no `` resellers '' involved . 
  in the microsoft dossier , microsoft ** is absent ** . 
  - as usual ... only romanians are corrupt , foreigners are blessed angels . 
   but even in the us airports are generally off limits for carrying . 
  they did n't disembark from a plane . 
  they simply went to the airport and performed their `` show '' . 
  moreover , what is airport security gon na do ? 
  chumps will always detonate * before * entering the security check . 
  so , what 's next , security before entering ? 
  marvelous , they 'll detonate * before * they 'll reach the airport 's entrance . 
  and it goes on n ' on n ' on with this counter domino effect . 
   but unfortunately even in the us the same thing would have probably happened . 
  i 'm not going to lecture about the realities in the us , but even as a non-american , i understand clearly that people with no guns - or protocol prohibition of guns ( such as gun free zones ) - always are the first victims to a possible attack of any kind . 
   do n't you think it 's kind of ironic that you 're accusing me of strawman arguments when you argue for giving everyone guns it is n't . 
   an event that could not have been averted by a gun-toting civilian in the first place . 
  no , it could 've , but the people choose to follow their instincts ( ie . 
  running like hell 's bells were beating ) since they did n't had the means to actually counter those nutters . 
   you 're taking advantage of a tragedy to go off on a tangent about how you do n't trust the police so you need a gun . 
  i promise , i 'll `` take advantage '' of the * next * tragedy and point out the same obviousness . 
  no , i do n't trust no police force because more often that i would 've like , they conspire with the same criminals they 're supposed to protect us from . 
   you posted a wall of text arguing that the bad guys are always going to get access to guns , so let 's just make them legal . 
  the bad guys ** will always ** find ways to get hold of guns . 
  of course they 'll be forever a threat to * us * , but why reject the general population into buying weapons themselves for protection ? 
  like i 've said , you 're the sheep ( you , me , everybody ) in this equation and those whom are assigned to protect us are either too scared to do anything , conspire with the same bad guys they 're supposed to protect us from or , simply , have no intention to do anything but to wear the goddamn uniform . 
  so , you know already bad guys will always get hold of guns , but you 're against legalisation of guns ??? 
  why are n't you empathetic to other people who want to take protection into their own hands ? 
  what kind of doublethinking are you chewing ?? 
  foolish . 
  before detonating , before claiming lives , until we get more informations ( assuming all of the witnesses were all been asked and now there 's an official report in the making ) , they 've brought aks and blazed bullets ( for a good amount , 1-2 minutes , not figuratively speaking ; time it yourself ) . 
  precious definitive time that could 've determine everything if people had guns . 
  instead ... no guns laws that , magically , do not apply to these scoundrels , yet some * delicate poofs * have trouble understanding basic defense , and would rather wait for the men in blue pants * after * the tragedy occured . 
  and , then , there 's the secret services which are either stunningly incompetent * or * dastardly cynical - not just in belgium 's case , mind you - that let these things unload ( no pun intended ) so they could aquire more power , more control , more financial resources , more surveillance authorization against innocent people . 
  strawman and there are , already , markets for that . 
  [ this one , too , speaks for itself . 
  ] ( http://www.alquds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/picdata/2016/03/03-22/22qpt777.jpg ), 
   so you want to make it easier for thugs and terrorists to obtain guns through straw buys and theft ? 
  they already , * easily * , obtain guns for their mischiefs . 
  the twist , which you deliberately avoid , is that the population would have real , genuine , defense at hand . 
   how would a gun protect you from a suicide bomber ? 
  the better question is : `` how would a gun ( ` guns ' , actually , not singular ) protect you from * anyone * that would want to cause harm , towards others or towards you ? 
  '' ; the correct answer is : ** a lot better than depending your life on the police - which always arrive ** *** after *** ** the gruesome activity occured - and a lot better than a bunch of ** *** incompetent *** ** or ** *** cynical *** ** ( i have yet to determine which , myself ) operatives , from the secret services , staying on their asses ( with unlimited resources and funds ) , intercepting phonecalls , reading emails , etcetera . 
  bugging innocent people - like myself , like yourself , like those whom you personally know - altogether trying to control the citizens via surveillance , intimidation and blackmail ** *** if one 's upsetting the establishment ***** . 
  **  1 ) their entire goal is to blow themselves up and take a bunch of people with them . 
  shooting at them only achieves that goal for them in a slightly unexpected way , genius . 
  their recent attack [ did n't ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35869254 ) involved immediate use of explosives , they started shooting from their aks before their suicide . 
  had someone - heck , everybody - carried guns at them , those nutters would n't have claimed lives that day ... `` genius '' . 
   2 ) it 's not like they give you a 5-minute notice . 
  they do n't generally announce themselves . 
  you do n't notice them until they fuck shit up . 
  that 's kind of their thing . 
  no , they did n't . 
  neither at charlie hebdo , nor at this attack . 
  before they activated their explosives , they already were blazing bullets , shouting how great their god is . 
   so explain to me , how 's letting regular joe get a gun going to help anyone in any way ? 
  the regular joe - well , * not you * , you 're not going to understand either way , you 're just stalling time - could prevent deaths before anything worse could happen or prevent it altogether . 
  criminals & outlaws will always , i repeat , *** always *** , find ways to obtain illegal products , from drugs to guns , and there 's more likely to control other people ( yours or yourself included ) via fear , intimidation & coercion . 
  that illegality alone of obtaining weapons makes the rest of the population ( you , me , anyone that * we * know ) sheeps to them . 
  often than we 'd like , the very same people that swore to protect us ( police and secret services ) will favor to strike a deal with outlaws & criminals . 
  hell , the establishment is n't restrained from hiring crimminals & outlaws to do dirty works for them , from prostitution to drug consumption , organ trafficking to human trafficking . 
  it 's puerile to make-believe they wo n't - oh , no , they can and they always will . 
  but , legislation permitting sale of guns ? 
  a wonderful thing , people would start to feel safer and have the means & accreditation to be so : they 'd have the means to protect themselves rather than depend on people that will always be late or be hand-in-hand with crimminals & outlaws . 
  of course , i wo n't expect you to understand . 
  to put into projection , your anti-gun belief is equal to those group of people being anti-vaxxers . 
  same rhetoric , different category . 
  poor eyes or acting foolish , are n't you ...   hey , if you want to be intimidated with no real defense , suit yourself . 
  so far , the secret services and police have shown their potential and real intentions , outside their job description . 
  however , that does n't mean i want to share your pacifist idealism . 
    yes . 
  ** if you have n't seen it by now , there was an ak found . 
  gee wizz , i wonder : how did a bunch of scumbags managed to get a hold on an assault weapon and bombs in a country , let alone the eu itself , where it 's illegal to buy guns ? 
  hmmm , gee , we got ta use our big brains , huh ... ** if you 're so oblivious or * acting * like a fool , there 's nothing to be argued with you . 
  by all means , let 's let nutjobs aquire weapons while the general population does n't have the means to do so . 
  yeah , so swell . 
  they asked for more big brother . 
  are you aware that you 're avoiding the obvious ? 
  yes . 
  if you have n't seen it by now , there was an ak found .
