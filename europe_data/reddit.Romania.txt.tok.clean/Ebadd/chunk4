   because it is not on-topic for this subreddit . 
  you know very well that 's not true . 
  praying again ? 
  i want 2nd amendment american-style law . 
  aaaaaand , about that death penalty ...

  [ `` neglected '' ? 
  ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2012-09-15-13228567-70-patriarhul-daniel.jpg ), 
  i suggest you read this with a cynical tone . 
  they 're mocking friedman and his `` throw money out of a heli '' . 
   he pulled the gun out from a box , and he cocked it immediately . 
  i did n't have anything , so i cooperated and we started to walk toward the second flour , to the prosecutor 's office . 
  he said he would kill everyone . 
  but the attacker did n't killed this gabor guy , and he openly admitted to him that he intends to kill everyone . 
  this is odd . 
   madacsi grabbed the barrel of the assault rifle and he tried to point it away from himself , when the attacker fired the first shot . 
  the bullet hit the ceiling . 
  i assume it was on semi-auto , then . 
  these guys were indeed lucky . 
   meanwhile they rolled down the stairs and the attacker fired again . 
  this scene would be funny if done in a skit . 
  how the hell do you manage to fire when rolling on stairs while hitting your ribs , spine , arms & legs ? 
   `` we were in the courtroom , when we heard a strange sound from outside , then another one . 
  someone said that maybe a table was turned over . 
  but twice?i told the the judge that i leave the room and i looked out to the corridor with my gun in my hand . 
  i 'm almost tempted to make a sadistic remark . 
  i 'll behave , but this is skit material , honestly , with some delicious cynicism added on top . 
   meanwhile karoly madacsi , who served earlier as a border guard , *** managed to remove the magazine from the rifle and shouted for help as the gun was empty . 
  gabor mohai , seargent first class gabor letavecz and seargent norbert kertesz helped him to handcuff the attacker *** . 
  what.the.fuck . 
  use your goddamn pistol , it 's not part of the uniform just to appear scary !, 
  he pulls the gun and simply cuffs him up , no need to use the gun you just pulled out on a guy who wanted to kill everyone in the building ??? 
  * facepalm *  on wednesday he weared earplugs , i 'm almost done ...  3 additional magazines were found in his jacket and he had additional ammo in his backpack , altogether 240 rounds , beside a knife and a great amount of chocolate bars . 
  yeah , this confirms it : at * best * , he did n't wanted to kill anybody , not even the target ( s ) ; at * worst * , he wanted to kill his target ( s ) but keep the rest as hostages . 
   who previously made several online rants against the judicial system and the judges and attorneys working in the building . 
  hmmm , this is interesting ... given that to us , romanians , `` guilty until proven innocent '' is a strange thing , i 'll assume he 's just crazy . 
  ---------------------------------------- now , let 's find some answers : 1 ) the guy was arrested and most likely he 'll be put behind bars , however , what will keep him away from knowing who were these three men ( minus the absent one ) that '' * cooked * '' block him from achieving his , whatever they may be , goal ( s ) ? 
  2 ) this was an extreme case , no shadow of a doubt , however , the last part about him ranting about the judicial system ca n't be considered an isolated case . 
  most assuredly , there are others who share his frustration , correct ? 
  3 ) what are the chances that people , whom may side with the attacker and his motives for what he 's done , wo n't attack these three guardsmen ? 
  retype it later when you have time . 
   onn is not a news channel there you go again , doing a strawman . 
  pathetic . 
   is any of this list of people that you mentioned a romanian ? 
  the point of the original comment was about starting enterprises , like those folks did in their times , and how things have changed so drastically that it 's virtually a lot more impossible to do it yourself . 
  as for the newer generation of entrepreneurship - albeit sadistic on my part - , none of them are romanian . 
  what 's the problem with the analogy ? 
  it 's the painful truth . 
  * just as a little sidenote i forgot to mention earlier : zuckerberg can not shake the suspicion that he has been helped by ` certain ` government agencies with his social media pet project . 
  but that 's going off the grid . 
  *  you 're glossing over tesla . 
  nope , pure random example . 
  what ??? 
  if i wrote - i do n't know - oil extraction industry , would you have started biting the butt by making comparisson of the top 10-100 oil exporters , then put it here like * `` ooh , you 're glossing over < name of the company  * ?!, 
  how dull and dense can you be ?? 
  smh  so if you do n't give the credit to musk , you still have to give it to martin eberhard and marc tarpenning let me guess : you 're convinced that what they 've done to their company , cashing it out to somebody else ( musk ) , was a great entrepreneurship manoeuvre ? 
  although , if i put it into my reason , nothing was lost because all three of them are american citizens ( with musk having two more , but that 's not an argument ) and the company is listed as an american company . 
  overall , nothing was lost : the american company is still in american hands . 
   after enzo ferrari died . 
  what do we have [ here ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_tesla_motors ) uh-huh , yep : * '' [ ... ] series a funding in 2004 , led by elon musk '' * . 
  even the original team could n't finance their newborn company without outside help , what a surprise , ** just as what i 've repeated over the last 3-4 comment previously and the prime issue being that no entrepreneur could ever start something without humongous help ** . 
   it 's the small guys from romania handing out piles of cash to a foreign ceo . 
  yes , surely that wo n't backfire if we start trusting foreign operatives , like before . 
   you my friend , are awfully misinformed . 
  romanian startup scene it 's better than it has ever been . 
  it 's no silicon valley , true - but rome was n't built in a night . 
  rome was n't outsourced nor cashed out to the bigger guys either . 
   vector watch   headquarters : gdynia , poland pass !, 
   timex [ group ]   headquarters : hoofddorp , netherlands   owner : fred . 
  pass !, 
   we 're very far away from being `` tech startup capital of europe '' , but at least we started . 
  i 've said it already : everything goes down to either being in native hands or cashed out like in the 90s and early 2000s . 
  it 's always have been like this since the industrial revolution . 
  moreover , just to play along a little while , where are the others , hmm ? 
  heavy & soft industries , commerce , financial , digital and so on , where are * our * diversity in economics , in native hands ? 
  i 'll tell where : [ here , from 0:45 to 1:20 ] ( https://youtu.be/-b9u5jkxt58?t=45s ) . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , bezos , page , zuckerberg & musk are n't romanian nor are their creation hq 'd in the homeland . 
   surely rocket science is well established and heavily-government-funded , no way a new private company could disrupt that . 
  or automotive industry , for that matter ... it 's a long time since ford and ferdinand porsche died , we 're not getting another one of these any time soon , right ? 
  not without preferences , no . 
  the world has changed and its rules too . 
  the best things i 've seen to come up on their own are : fitness gyms , coffee shops , fast food joints ( local ) , restaurants , farmers ' market ( which most buy vegetables & fruits from other countries ) , computer repairs , auto transport and other crepuscules . 
  nothing to influence , nothing to control & nothing to gain globally ; mere crepuscules . 
  if a john would want to start a new car company , he would n't have the necessities to begin one ; starting with money & huge land property , then infrastructure , forging machinery etc. 
  the alternatives is for him to die without achieving any of this * or * join an already existing car company ; both options are flagellatory . 
  and not just car companies , other heavy & soft industries , commerce multinationals , financial giants so on . 
   it is a genuine branch of entrepreneurship . 
  there are people who are good at building up companies but suck at running them . 
  they can then hire management or sell off the company to someone who is good at running businesses . 
  i ca n't argue with that , because there 's nothing to argue about it , however , i 'll return to my previous comment : if somebody , anybody , would want to start a * real * ( cue `` no true scotsman '' ) & * genuine * enterprise , they could n't on their own , ever . 
   a lot of those people either started off with money , took decades to get their business of the ground , or , in the case of friedrich krupp , layed the ground work for the next generation to grow the business . 
  we do n't have the time like they did , anymore . 
   the it startups have given us a bit of a skewed perspective on how new companies can take of . 
  in my book , it startups are n't the epitome of industrial complexes , finance or commercial giants . 
  if they 're self-sustaining/self-supporting industrial complexes , finance & commercial giants , bonus points for economic power & influence . 
   i think we 'll be seeing a lot of eastern europeans coming from the west with those connections and a lot more new companies starting not from the new generation that is wanting to stay but from a slightly older generation that have gone and are bringing back what they need to succeed . 
  that 's one of the problems : go see help , make `` connections '' ( which is concession , btw ) & nothing gets solved in the long term . 
  we do n't need another 90s . 
   in fact many entrepreneurs do just that : build a company from scratch and peddle it to potential buyers . 
  that 's not genuine entrepreneurship nor an impervious idea .
