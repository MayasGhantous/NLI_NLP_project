  look at the country . 
  cultural capital & autochtonous capital are real & unique economic factors ; there 's the difference having a * foreign * company in the hands of * foreign people * originating from * x/y/z * country , which is * foreign * to us . 
  but * we * do n't have those , in our name or control , anymore , to make differences in the world . 
  that 's the problem : lack of cultural & autochtonous capital . 
  instead , cashing out like we 've did in the 90s ; a mistake that 'll continue to cost & haunt generations ... and , apparently , nobody thinks it 's a fatalist deathclock !, 
  oh , but sure , romanian teenagers think you can make a future with call-centers , companies & firms owned by foreign entities/people . 
  yeah , `` economic progress '' my buttocks ... 
  extremely difficult to bar impossible , if we 're talking * genuine * entrepreneurship ; if we 're considering in the first place , i mean . 
  lem me ` splain : in nowadays world , if we were to hold a '' * what if ... * '' hypothesis , the original tycoons & industrialists from the past would n't be able to start their bussinesses , in the first place , by their own , alone . 
  people like enric bernat , armand peugeot , louis vuitton , raymond brown & george calder cunningham , charles rolls & henry royce , james lancaster , hugo hirst , john mennons , gerard philips & frederik philips , august kessler , nicola romeo , enzo ferrari , horacio pagani , wilhelm mauser & paul mauser , edmund heckler & theodor koch , hugo boss , friedrich krupp etcetera ( the list could go on n ' on n ' on ) would n't be able to , * hypothetically * , restart their bussinesses from scratch in our world of today . 
  alone , they never ever could . 
  but , wait ... the article does n't specify this aspect , so , i assume they do n't care about this important issue ... oh well ... 
  [ seth meyers ' segment from his show is insightful as well . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whgsh33d8bk ), 
  cheer up : the exciting part is finding a black british smith , having the surname william . 
  if you find such a person , you 're lucky . 
   is it too much to ask for independence , sovereignty and democracy ? 
  [ well ... ] ( http://thisisafrica.me/france-loots-former-colonies/ ), 
  i hope so . 
  yes . 
   recently nationalistic parties in europe are getting an unprecedented amount of support . 
  if * said * nationalistic parties receive support from foreign entities , then it 's not `` nationalistic '' to begin with . 
  why ? 
  other than some futuristic , utopian , machine for good manners , `` the beatings will continue until morale improves '' does n't work unless you want to give birth to monsters , on the long term . 
  besides , we should n't alter their behaviour * too * much , otherwise , the world will become dull if rappers , suddenly , stop appearing , spit in the mic & drop 'em dope rhymes . 
  yeah , yeah , sure , exclude latin and feed the immigrationist theorists that want to harm us . 
  the rusophiles are ~ ~ delicted ~ ~ delighted , i 'm sure . 
  * edit * wording it correctly , on my part , but anarchisto 's comment is nonchalantly wrong & oblivious to the bone 's marrow . 
  whoever wants to chew on it or vehemently protect it is n't any better than those who hate us ; friend , foe or neutral . 
  of course , umberto eco 's words ( may he rest in peace ) are ripe , for reality , forever : now every idiot without the minimal [ general ] knowledge on something has the internet to slime in his personal , anecdotal , opinions as facts , which can vary upon one 's sources of information or knowledge gathering , and its credibility . 
  with most of my conationals , this ' basically founded on xenophilia and self-harming because ... of the heck of it . 
  this is why the country , after +25 years , is what it is . 
  of course , it 's far , * far * , more easy to leave issues behind rather than confront/solve them . 
  but that 's another nerve-touching issue , so , * sshhhh ... *, 
  firstly , change your flair flag . 
  why ? 
  it 'd be more honesty than hypocrisy , * and you know it * . 
  secondly , there 's a deadline , 25 years . 
  these types of actions are noted , they 're *** not *** * un * seen , they 're *** not *** turned with a blind eye . 
  the germans ' exaltation was noted , the french 's excitement was archived , the italians ' bunga-bunga was videotaped & stored into the blackbox , the british ( i think ) too ; all of which saved * for later use * . 
  now us , as petty as it is ? 
  third , geopolitics . 
  there are more to be said & heard , and frankly , i dunno who reads these comments , but there are several geopolitical matters at stake . 
  these actions are more valuable to our enemies than to some of our short-sighted friends . 
  i would n't be surprised if a disinterested person * or * a moron , sipping frappuccino , would n't care about global matters . 
  i would n't blame it , but it 'd be better if you , at least , keep to yourself certain opinions ; that is , in your mind and leave them there . 
  as of now , at least three replies to my original comment ( and one made to you by bobobama ) , almost all of them ( excluding you , congrats ) , are ~ ~ morons ~ ~ ~ ~ mentally challenged ~ ~ mere ( empty on the inside ) crepuscules chewing clich\u00e9s , internet memes and/or contracting just for the sake of counter-argumenting . 
  therefore , i do n't expect them to understand a dime even if it 'd be presented in their face , point blank . 
  at best , they 're xenophiles counter-argumenting that `` others are doing it too , why should n't we as well '' or , at worst , 'em pty on the inside ' crepuscules . 
  drop the rusophiliac mindset and , maybe , i 'll tell you why it could turn into a bad thing for us on the long term . 
  this might be bad ... 
  why do you wonder , some retrogrades with deep mental problems , in their 30s , think of themselves as `` young '' .

  mars in siberia , rusofilule !, 
  if common sense & unbiased thoughts were a thing through your head and others ' , life would n't be filled with grievances everyday , every hour . 
  * ooops * , am i attacking your free speech ? 
  do n't look further , it 's just symbolic and nothing more . 
  * edit * also , a better question is : why did n't he faced life behind bars in the 90s , just after the revolution ? 
  oh , wait , that 's a correct question to ask , not just ~ ~ circus ~ ~ handcuffs on camera pretending to do justice ... 
  you 'll see upholding & cheers to that one , but this one , whaddya see , everybody is against it . 
  and the big brother one went just as a banal afternoon . 
  double standards , both . 
  give me a break , `` censorship '' ?!? 
  if you 're accused out of the random ( no evidence , no proof , no correlation , no nothing , just outright character assassination just because someone thinks another person is guilty of ... ` `` something '' ` ... they do n't know , but they 're sure it 's ... ` `` something '' ` ) , to be an outlaw , you 've immediately lost a lot of credibility without second thoughts from others . 
  you might as well be a puritan : the moment some smuck from the internet * or * with a microphone under the nose & a pointed camera * or * with a `` yours truly ... '' piece of paper * or * written allegation ( circus with handcuffs , starring the dna , he-hey ) , you 're burned without chance of recovery . 
  after all of that , even after you 've proven yourself innocent ( that 's right , in romania , you have to prove yourself innocent ) nothing would pardon you from the public eye , you 're already `` dirty '' no matter what , puritan or not , guilty ... * or not * . 
  ffs , a lot do n't know the difference between indictment & conviction . 
  they think it 's the same thing !, 
  and if anyone , truly , has a problem with freedom of speech , to such idiocy calling this ^ law appealing to censorship , then it 's [ double standards ] ( http://www.gandul.info/politica/cum-a-ajuns-politia-internetului-in-legea-antilegionara-a-liberalilor-antonescu-si-scutaru-in-general-lumea-crede-ca-poate-face-orice-pe-facebook-14665241 ) seen clear from the moon . 
  and [ this one ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/legea-big-brother-promulgata-de-presedinte-14817477 ) , just to add some icing . 
  self-loathe mixed with xenophilia . 
   and i can relate to your mentality . 
    * '' ~ ~ love my country but ~ ~ if shit hits the fan i 'll be packing up and ensuring safety for my family . 
  '' * fixed that only for you . 
  are you even patriotic or just another xenophile ? 
  because you ca n't be patriotic and a xenophile at the same time . 
  ... while undermining & destroying the domestic/autochtonous capital in the name of xenophilia because , right , all foreigners are innocent , while all romanians are corrupt . 
  forgot that part , op u/smenaru . 
  like a humble xenophiliac . 
  yeah , i mean , that jesus of nazareth guy ... phew , attacking roman values & traditions , imposing himself as the messiah , defying yahweh and his laws , as well . 
  how about that other guy , napoleon : a real terrorist & leader of the french , worse than our isis & al-baghdadi nowadays . 
  and a loooooot of terrorists in december 1989 ... a lot , a lot , of terrorists attacking the state 's interests . 
  tsk , tsk , tsk ... 
  honestly , there 's nothing to * not * hate vegetarians and cyclists . 
   it also about how it was done ( over night vote which ignoring any discussion and other standard practices ) you expect niceties with the head ( s ) of the national mass-media that were put by the previous government , your opposition ? 
  no offense but in politics , any thing that has to do with public media , is to be turned into your own hub , otherwise , expect criticism and propaganda from your opponents ' frontmen . 
  this is n't strictly about freedom of speech : it 's politics of play or be played . 
   ( publicly threatening individual journalists with firing , bashing them for any criticism toward government , threatening private media with legal actions , saying shit like `` current media declared war on poland '' etc. ), 
  obviously , that is bad which does n't have nothing to do with the public media or free speech . 
   of course they replaced most of top management but they did over time in civilized fashion , overglorifying pettiness . 
   allowing journalists associated with opposition to continue their work . 
   * no offense but in politics , any thing that has to do with public media , is to be turned into your own hub , otherwise , expect criticism and propaganda from your opponents ' frontmen . 
  * like war , it 's all about which side you reside with . 
  he knows the theft of resources is what made the www countries wealthy , it 's a no-brainer by default when discussing economics on this topic . 
  on his twitter , he persists that `` good governance '' ( ?!? ), 
  will solve their economic problems . 
  yeah , yeah try fixing an economy by * not * letting it develop ways of creating autochthonous capital & enterprise , let it all loose to foreign enterprises to gauch it all up , competition being optional too . 
  the rest are politics & treaties , the * bonus * link explains it all . 
  * just as a sidenote , * these problems are the same reasons why [ parts of central and all of eastern europe have trust issues ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wdt5j/the_hypocrisy_of_eastern_europe/ ) ( sole exception being xenophiles ) .
