  [ i dunno what to say about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vtdgb03pk4 ) ... 
   the problem is , the stolen-wealth theory is wrong . 
    oh , it 's absolutely true that colonial powers stole natural resources from the lands they conquered . 
  no one disputes that . 
  and at the time , this definitely made the colonized regions a lot poorer . 
    it 's also probably true that this stolen wealth helped much of the west get rich .

  i 'm against any type of marriages or partnerships for two reasons : 1 ) i 'm anti-statist & anti-collectivist ; why the fuck is the government 's business with whom you want to get it down ? 
  2 ) i 'm against organized religion of any kind , majority & minority . 
  faith is one thing , religion is a whole different category . 
  religion , like statism , is the same : collective in nature . 
  you want to be with someone ? 
  good , go with it , as simple as that . 
  the end . 
  some of my conationals that are `` disappointed '' in any way forgot ( or they were n't born ) time when government was up your life for 45 years . 
  aight ... who wears the crown ? 
  the craziest * de jure politicians * are those whom were not voted in office , in the government . 
  nope , not in an ad infinitum . 
  you have to know the language to understand it . 
  to make it a tad simpler in english , i 've written ` homelands ' in italic . 
  [ it 's obvious why , neighbour ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/maury_geography_115a_asia_relief.jpg ) two birds with one stone . 
  besides , you 'll `` get back '' transylvania only when we get back transtisa . 
  when do you smile and wink at a hungarian & russian ? 
  when the butt is steady on the shoulder , the finger relaxed n ' sturdy , and the scope aiming between the eyes . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ a romanian , a hungarian and a gypsy were all fishing on a lake . 
  somehow , their rods catch the same fish , a golden fish . 
  the fish says : \\ - since all of you caught me , i 'll grant only one wish to each one of you . 
  \\ - i want all hungarians be/feel at home , each one of them wealthy & happy , ^ says ^ the ^ hungarian . 
  the hungarian - poof - disappears . 
  \\ - i want all gypsies be/feel at home , each one of them wealthy & happy , ^ says ^ the ^ gypsy . 
  the gypsy - poof - disappears . 
  \\ - so , ^ the ^ romanian ^ asks , the hungarians and gypsies , all of them , are back to their * homelands * , wealthy & happy ? 
  \\ - yes , hungarians and gypsies are back to their * homelands * , wealthy and happy . 
  the romanian looks at the gold fish , releases it and says goodbye . 
  the gold fish is somewhat surprised and asks : \\ - are n't you going to wish something too ? 
  \\ - well , ^ says ^ the ^ romanian , i 'd wish for a coca-cola but you already granted me two wishes . 
  * there are more `` tainted '' ones but , as of now , it 's enough . 
  we 're world champions at hypocrisy & wrangle . 
  after the plane lands , people start clapping . 
  before the plane takes off , people do the cross . 
  we 're world champions at hypocrisy & wrangle . 
  for example , we condemn hunting wild boars but have no problem gutting domestic pigs , let them agonize , gather their blood in a basin ( for sausages , obviously ) , and then comfort ourselves that this is better than buying `` that rubber from foreign supermarkets , and eat real meat '' . 
  another example ... we condemn parliament for all the woes ( some justifiable , to be fair ) the nation is going through but there 's a catch : that parliament , for better or worse , was voted by masses of people . 
  you got that ? 
  the hypocrisy here is this : most romanians do not vote to exercise their right to choose , but to have a scapegoat the second minute for any problem they may and will have . 
  those officials , corrupt or not , did n't forced their way to those positions , they were voted in . 
  some of my conationals might argue : `` yeah , but they 're the only ones , we want a new political class '' . 
  the are three ways to achieve that : one , kill a lot of them ( blood vengeance ) ; two , do not vote them at all or vote a minority party , there 's no excuse ; three , wait and expect their offsprings to get into their dads ' & moms ' positions within the mainstream parties . 
  `` during new times , it 's still us '' as the saying goes . 
  another example ... we blame ourselves for social , spiritual ( soul ) & economical `` illnesses '' , we 'd favor a foreigner than one of our own ( the dictator mentality is still prevalent , as envy still strives , sadly ) , but when that foreigner proves to be another son-of-a-whore shill that made us some counterproductive results , we blame soros , the ngos , the nwo , cabal etc. 
  ; yet not realise that xenophilia is not at all a positive recipe to remake a country in every way . 
  oh well , `` the german/french/japanese / etc. 
  knows what he does [ best ] '' . 
  another example ... we curse , we blame , we invoke the heavens & hell to act against somebody we do n't like * buuuuuut * ... god forbid that we 'd wish that person to die . 
  it 's something among the lines : `` i do n't curse you , but i wish upon you/your family that heaven & hell < * write the misfortune here *  '' . 
  or if it 's a corrupt official : `` i wish that bastard the evils & misfortunes of the world againt him/her . 
  death ? 
  no , no , no , i do n't wish death upon anyone '' . 
  see , lack of bloodthirst ( even justifiable , ffs !, 
  ) , yet no problems to other grievousnesses . 
  another example ... christmas carols & singers . 
  i do n't mind christmas carols but they 've become psychologically harmful , at least to me . 
  they take advantage over a series of emotions ( again , you might be caught offguard , even if you 're ice-cold ) , sing a carol or two , then expect money or other goods . 
  * * that . 
  * that 's begging & tainting something that is considered ... uhmm ... fuck it , i only get angry more and i do n't want to . 
  another example ... this one is fairly stupid and it involves the old saying `` beggars ca n't be choosers '' . 
  let 's say a corrupt official is arrested , condemned , sent to jail , and after a while , released . 
  however , that official would not have any problems if the voting season started and here 's why : even though he/she stole , `` he/she did something to our town '' . 
  do you understand the rhetoric ? 
  `` i know that he/she steals , like the ones before him/her , but he/she actually did ` some ' things in our town . 
  another example ... democracy sold via mail & its perversion . 
  the expats , which i myself am ( i try my best to not be hypocrite ) , do not - i repeat - *** do not *** pay any taxes or imposts to the country of origin 's national budget , yet many of these dimwitted half-assed degenerate morons want voting rights within the country of origin 's political stage . 
  in other words , a romanian living & working in italy , that pays taxes & imposts to the italian budget ^ ** !, 
  ** , wants voting rights for the romanian political stage , to which he/she *** does n't *** contribute a single coin to the romanian budget , but has no problems paying for the italian budget . 
  * again , this is a random example , i could 've brought any country which a romanian expatriated diaspora exists * . 
  do you understand ? 
  these idiots want voting rights on somebody else 's taxed/imposted money . 
  i , as an expat , do not pay any taxes or imposts to the romanian national budget , i only pay taxes & imposts to the country i currently reside in , and do not want to be considered a burden/parasite to the rest within the country [ of origin ] , voting on their money . 
  however ... 
  i 'm but just one exception per the thousand ( s ) ... not only that this is hipocrisy , it 's downright fraudulent extorted blackmail with a white mask to hide these stab-in-the-back vices . 
  some of these hipocrites , with sporadic audacity , as if the logic is n't self-evident by now , argue that `` we send money in the country '' ; specifically , to their mommy , daddy and/or wifey | hubby . 
  did you catch that fallacy ? 
  they actually believe that sending money to these persons , of whom the moron associates with , thinks he/she contributes his/her fair share to the national budget . 
  however , given that not all of us are idiots , there 's a grave , grave error to that mindset , a big fallacious , diarrhea mindset : the money , which the idiot `` sends into the country '' , are spent on taxes & imposts of which *** mommy , daddy and/or wifey | hubby are already obligated , by default , to pay on their own behalf , as per individual , *** yet the moron does n't pay * his/her own personal , per individual , * taxes & imposts to the national budget , but has no problems throwing hissy fits for voting rights . 
  newsflash , according to logic : ask for voting rights to the authority to which you pay your taxes & imposts . 
  but that ... that takes , apparently , great mental aptitudes to figure it out ; this rudimentary fact of reason . 
  i could go on but i honestly do n't want my inbox to explode with * their * idiocy . 
  it 's enough that i shed some light on these issues . 
  you say it in such a way that one might believe you 're insinuating they - the owners - are inherently evil for not abandoning their only place to live , even if it 's a red-code disaster if an earthquake hits . 
  and if it 'll happen , it 'll happen , nothing we or anybody else could do to prevent a natural occurence , deadly as it is . 
  [ uh-huh ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0eon1mzn2g ), 
  home alone i , ii , iii . 
  my two biggest problems are these : 1 ) this law is n't original nor unique . 
  it was , at best , a `` look at others how they did , we should copy + paste them '' . 
  classic self-hating xenophilia . 
  2 ) this , from economics101 , is grievously intrusive : as the business owner , you want to have as much clients as you can get ( besides , you pay taxes and knowing our system here , is awful but that 's another topic ) , how else but to accept their own consumerist relaxation habits such as smoking & drinking alcohol . 
  but no , with this law , this will affect bussinesses greatly . 
  some restaurants have smoking and non-smoking areas , others do n't , what can you do but choose , you are n't forced to go where you do n't want to , are you ? 
  of course , all hail government , big daddy , big brother , only he can protect you from yourself , freedom is slavery , and who 'll build the roads other than the government ... what a sick irony , compared to what happened for 45 years + 26 recent years .
