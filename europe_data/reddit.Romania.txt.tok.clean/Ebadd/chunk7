  it 's the same , collectivist , dirt . 
  different shoes & different colors ; that i agree . 
  everything comes down to two axioms , no matter how much anyone would try to disect them : ** collectivism vs individualism ** . 
  always . 
  fascism is as left-wing as it promotes the collective before the individual , the economics in favor of an authoritarian god-like `` big daddy '' to decide for everything within thr echelon . 
  the differences ? 
  that the government allows some business/corporate ass kissers to keep their thing , just as long as they preach in favor of the fascist authority ? 
  pffft , * such * `` difference '' between them and the comrade directors . 
  like arguing between ` to - * mah * - to ' & ` to - * may * - to ' or between ` favour ' & ` favor ' . 
  fascism is as left-wing as the other left-wing/far left factions that dominated the 20th century . 
  they promote the collective , not the individual ; * that * aspect is the head of the curve for everything . 
  logic does n't kill the poultry so you wo n't starve to death , i tell you that much . 
   such as ? 
  just in europe 's case : [ 1917 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/october_revolution ) to [ 1989 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1989 ) . 
  [ 1922 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_on_rome ) to [ 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_benito_mussolini ) . 
  [ 1919-1933 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler%27s_rise_to_power ) to [ 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_adolf_hitler ) . 
   also i never implied that at all , pretty much my comment specially talks about the ` far-right ' . 
  should n't be that hard to read . 
  a fan of logical fallacy & tu quoque , 2 in one , good job . 
  implying left - far left is the best option , nevermind recent history of the 20th century . 
  it 's called `` instinct of survival '' .

  orban learned all that from our previous president . 
  too much to our disadvantage , we 're lacking autochtonous capital !, 
   the eu is ploughing $ 22,000,000,000 into romania between 2014-2020 . 
  you poor , exploited victims . 
  then , we have the example of greece , where they have to return all those moneyz back , via foreign-owned businesses within their country , ca n't use them to create domestic + held businesses or help create domestic + held businesses , and wonder ... where all that solidarity is at ...  and dacia really did count as nothing before renault bought it if that were the case , it 's a wonder how all the ex-warsaw pact countries , with all their ex-industries that are n't there anymore , are n't overshadowing germany & france & uk . 
  pft , what a laugh , could n't you have brought something else ? 
  no , it 's shared , it 's not only mine . 
  why should constanta & varna compete with amsterdam , rotterdam & others with such low prices compared to them ? 
  no , of course not , that would severly hit the dutch interests along with french-german-belgium commonshared interests & their economies as a whole . 
  why not extort romania & bulgaria into caving up for foreign privatisation , and then , * maaaaaybe * we 'll let them in schengen , drive the profits outside those countries ( just like the examples ganymede wrote to you ; corporate blackmail under the guise of `` free market '' ) into the homelands of the blue banana . 
  aparently , some of you continue to think we are n't still capable of producing economists and analysts . 
  only the logistics alone could be seen by a 9th grader in economics class . 
   or is it something you believe because `` muh , evil west ! '' ? 
  to your misfortune , your fool is somewhere else to be found . 
   i didnt say it is . . 
  i meant a company owning things in other countries is not strange , nor forbidden . 
  by the time things will unravel , i will expect a lot of xenophobia against those whom craved for our autochtonous capital , bribe for it ( and ruin it ) , then what was left to be used as extortion `` give us money or else ... '' . 
  btw , given that you 're flemish , it 's a tad easy for me to explain another grievous malevolence ... do you know why romania and bulgaria were n't accepted in schengen , even before the immigration crisis ? 
  the mainstream memo is because of technicalities ( although we 've well fulfilled our duties in that aspect ) , yet there 's another reason and , i have to admit , it did took me a while to realise it : dutch-french-german-belgian interests want constanta 's and varna 's harbors privatized in their hands , not in autochtonous ( romanian or bulgarian ) control . 
  until then , looks like amsterdam , rotterdam * et * others are naval-commerical locations and us outside schengen . 
  nice ... although , with the immigration , you can shove schengen somewhere ... 
   well , you would have little knowledge of the fact that at least in natural gas distribution and electrical distribution , western companies have carved up whole areas of romania where they each have a monopoly , by bribing our politicians . 
  vai de tine , self-haterule si de disonanta cognitiva de care dispui ... 
   it is called a free market economy . 
  is it now , i did n't knew corporate blackmail means free market . 
   have your grandparents and parents lived under 4-5 decades of communiet dictatorship ? 
   did you grow up in the 90 's in eastern europe having to watch your mother work 12 hour shifts for 70 $ a month ? 
   did you pack bread and boiled pig fat to middle school because that 's all you could afford ? 
  that ... any of those ... are n't his problems , it 's * ours * . 
  jelousy is n't a sign of intelligence either . 
    make no mistake , we need immigration too , but unlike you , we have the hindsight and the opportunity to do it right . 
    after germany hand-picks the qualified ones for its ' industry , the least capable ones , barely able to read and write in their own language will be sent to the poor periphery . 
  well , which one is it : do we need immigration or not ?!? 
  so much cognitive dissonance , self-hating , bias . 
   landsgemeinde where the whole village can `` take matters in their own hands '' . 
  it says that it was abandoned with the exception of two cantons . 
  what happened ? 
   oh , the term you did n't use in your previous comment ? 
  yes , the term nobody knows about nor uses it as often . 
  you have a problem with that , hm ? 
   you seem awfully brave for first starting using racist terms and then avoiding risk . 
  right back at ya . 
   oh , so we should call them egyptians ? 
  the term * cygany/cygany * did n't took off like * gypsy * . 
  as for * egypt * & * egyptians * , without causing a flame war on the internet , you need some pebbles for your history . 
  frankly , i do n't want to risk it . 
  yep , definetly paid their taxes with money from legal activities ... 
   the gypsies make money on the back of the normal dude . 
   who is worst ? 
  both , in equal measure . 
  sssssssssshh ... we 're the baddies when it 's convenient . 
  * see schengen *  wow , thanks for giving us all that shit about integrating ~ ~ roma ~ ~ ** gypsies ** back in 2000 . 
  where should we send them ? 
  call them what they are . 
  * edit * 2000 ? 
  i 'm more than certain the first sighting started in 1994-1995 . 
   1856 gee , was it yesteday ? 
  or the day before that ? 
  speak for yourself , italian . 
  ah , so you 're having your version of b\u0103sescu & co. 
  problem ? 
  never would i guessed that name is danish . 
  til . 
   magyarbros , ~ ~ pls ~ ~ do n't do this . 
  t_t you 're passive with that '' * pls * '' . 
  so * you * forgave them already , did ya ... 
  unlike you and others like you , apologists , i do n't forget or forgive . 
  did n't had our justice in that scandal . 
  but since you 're probably an expatriate , it figures you 'd stick with foreigners . 
  what a waste of plastic , ink and paper in your id & passport . 
  no , we butcher them , package them as horse meat , sell it into europe ( since it 's * finesse * to eat horse meat , clearly we do n't get it ) , some sons-of-whores decide to relabel as ` cattle ' meat , a scandal goes off , those sow pass the buck unto us , we get the blame & they escape . 
  this is one of the reasons we must legalize assisted suicide . 
  i suspect that a lot of those who survived , including the injured , tripped others on the floor and stomped on them - killing them in the process - , reaching for the exit . 
  it 's called `` crowd rush '' . 
  do you have anything else besides straw-man & non sequitur ? 
   there is nothing wrong with halloween . 
  your agenda is transparent as hell . 
   also , it was not a halloween party , it was a rock concert , but i guess that 's bad too , since it 's not wholesome and conservative .
