  oh , go in a firing nightclub , you nitwit , i was remarking the ironical ( perhaps cynical ) coincidence . 
  `` agenda '' . 
  another useful idiot with internet connection to imply `` agendas '' . 
  gfy with your horse glasses . 
   maybe you should blame the club owners and the ones responsible for safety instead of the victims ? 
  the `` victims '' knew what they were going in : a small building with no safety space in case of emergencies . 
  alas , here you are , asking for regulations so that everyone should have a hand to hold on . 
  face it : they knew where they were going and what the risk could 've been . 
  they bet with their lives & they lost . 
  they 've consented themselves by not having second-thoughts . 
  this is n't strictly about law , it 's about having a brain in that skull of yours , along with eyesight , and the sense of self-preservation . 
  ffs , look in what country we have , what infrastructure and so on !, 
  and if you 're going to imply the responsibility on the owners , let me bargain on top of that : who gave them the licenses to open/legitimize the building as a nightclub , you nitwit ? 
  santa clause ? 
   you 're not a `` degenerate '' if you want to have some laughs with your friends . 
  you can have laughs in your own private parties , not in a crowd . 
  alas , the zombie-like mentality have so much to be desired ... let alone for expectations . 
  keep this on mind , since redditors might not realise it , yet some of you will pass it intentionally : ** how many of those who survived , even some of the injured , are murderers ? 
  ** ever heard of *** `` stampede '' *** or , to be more precise , of *** `` crowd rush '' *** ? 
  i 'll repeat again because it 's important : ** which ones of those who survived , including the injured , are murderers ? 
  ** have fun seeing it from my perspective . 
  * keep the downvotes comin ' you pure , narrow-minded , snowflakes . 
  i am right on this one . 
  * for once , with personal proof from now on , agoraphobics are legit . 
  i do n't know how to feel about this . 
  for one , what the hell were they doing in such a small crowded building ?!? 
  remember , this is n't your typical club , with lots of space , no , it 's somewhere small in terms of safety . 
  you 'd think self-preservation would 've kicked in but , no , the zombie crowd ( since it 's halloween ) mentality won the day ... and lost their lives in return . 
  second , this miniature shellshock ( keep the counter going up ) will nicely bring down to earth , on their feet , some zombie-like degenerates , hit in the face with reality when life ai n't anymore about being cool or about extravaganza or vanity or what car you have or what social backround you 're in . 
  maybe , this moronic incident might change something from the perspective of collective mentality . 
  lesson learned . 
  now prepare to watch the [ political ] propagandists turn & blame on each other like the dead policeman 's case . 
  though , i have to admit , these type of social shellshocks are actually good : it disturbs the social lethargy & the status quo our society has moisted itself in , and remind ourselves in what country we live , what economy , what infrastructure , what ... * about everything * . 
  it 's good but compromises must be made . 
  oh well ... at the end of the day , the cruel reality wins , always . 
  alas , with this little tragedy , i 'm quite curious how things will evolve , on all levels . 
  last we need is another earthquake and bam ... that would be the last drop as an incentive to * actually * do something ... but that would be far too late . 
  by the way , in case you 're not observing nor wanting to think about it : ** the parents have no excuse ** . 
  their tears have no excuse . 
  and do n't forget the crowd rush ( stampede ) : which ones of those who survived , included the injured , are murderers . 
  he attributed that himself , you and others like you months ago for lurch . 
  you 've taken your position , do n't retract it back just 'cause you do n't agree to it no more . 
  you and others hate the social democrats , yet you see this surplus like a big ... plus . 
  foreign capital = / = domestic , autochtonous , capital . 
  when xenophilia runs rampant , nothing 's going to change . 
  you really ought not to think all of us have short-memory . 
  gtfo ... 
   still has nothing to do with the budget surplus . 
  all social-democrats are evil but , apparently & completely unbelievable , this budget surplus appears to be a good thing . 
  you can figure the rest of the straw-man fallacy yourself , boy ... 
  you did n't read the whole comment , have n't you . 
  do n't look at it as if it 's a good thing : because of fear , officials will act like autists dealing with problems . 
  `` a road needs fast repairs . 
  nah , ca n't risk a denunciation from an unknown denouncer if we start paying to repair it . '', 
  `` schools need help . 
  nah , the secret services are listening to me and they 'll most likely bring denouncers to accuse me of something . '', 
  this ai n't the dictatorship of the constitution . 
  it 's the dictatorship of prosecutors and the secret services . 
  it 's a period that i like - even if it 's not pc to say/write it as such , it 's the most accurate - to call it as `` the autistic bureacratic period '' . 
  they are fearing of being denounced by some nobodies , while having to through character assassination and flashly headlines that give the impression life 's improving . 
  it 's not . 
  one more thing to clarify , which some of my conationals would , intentionally , fail to mention : the ` heavies ' from the previous government , liberal-democrats & their financial supporters + the ex-president , are safe n ' quiet after all those billions stolen , before 2012 . 
  after 2012 , lib-dems fusioned with the national-liberals , that supported lurch the previous autumn elections . 
  in other words , in case you do n't understand the situation : all social-democrats post-2012 are evil but , gosh-darn it , it 's only a * coincidence * that the heavies from libdems , now in the ` bigger-ish ' nationl liberal party , are all taintless . 
  a lot is n't being done because the influential head of the dna and the secret services were all appointed by the previous president . 
  they 've struck a deal to not bother him & his former pals with corruption charges ( the * real * stolen billions ) . 
  enjoy your flashy headline ... 
  why would * we * care , we do n't have our own capital in domestic hands or autochtonous businesses , corporations , multinationals . 
  everything 's a territorial lend-lease for production that is n't in domestic hands ( and by `` domestic hands '' , i mean * our own * entrepreneurs & businessmen ) . 
  forget about it . 
  do they have a choice ? 
  *** i see the downvoting brigade has assembled . 
  hmm ... ***  to explain the background : this article comes from a tv station that belongs to one of the corrupted politicians kovesi 's anti-corruption agency put in jail last year . 
  prior to being the agency 's chief , she was romania 's chief prosecutor . 
  the prosecutor whom indicted him was found a corrupt bastard that abused his power as a prosecutor . 
  you 've let that out . 
   she , along with the former agency director moraru , are enemy no . 
  2 and no . 
  3 of this `` news '' organisation . 
  oh , yes , [ morar ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/romania/daily-summary-criminal-prosecutor-emilian-eva-restitutions-magnate-305930.html ) . 
  \\* * note to the english-speaking folk in here : there are n't enough sites , dubbed in english as well , to tell as much as it can be said about daniel morar , the ex-dna chief , which served the previous president . 
  a lot of corruption and political police in the name of `` independent justice '' . 
  *  she already won an anti-defamation lawsuit against them . 
  they were unjustly made to pay 60,000 euros because they have shown irrefutable proof ( video + audio ) that the ex-president brother was doing illegal business with certain gypsies to influence judges ( surprise-surprise ) , while the ex-president & his brother getting a cut . 
  [ more about the case ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/romania/the-mircea-basescu-bercea-scandal-in-the-international-media-293434.html ) , as you can do additional searches yourself . 
  however , the part regarding kovesi 's defamation lawsuit , was because the news channel has said numerous times that she protected the president 's brother regarding this case with the gypsies . 
  and she did . 
  regardless , the `` independet justice '' found that it was a ` defamation ' case for telling the truth . 
  [ more about the ex-president 's brother . 
  ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/search/mircea-basescu.html?lang=en )  basically , the only thing they have n't accused her of so far is having gills , otherwise everything it 's been there . 
  no , besides doing a fine work themselves regarding corruption , they have repeatedly said it in the past the following saying ( translated from romanian ) : `` all of b\u0103sescu 's people/henchmen , including b\u0103sescu himself , are horrible people that committed the most hideous corrupt acts , yet the people b\u0103sescu put in dna and sri ( romania 's fbi ) are immaculate and incorruptible . '', 
  with an * / s * at the end , of course . 
   antena 3 is essentially the romanian fox news , except with less backbone and moral fiber ( yep , possible ) . 
  is foxnews affiliated with cnn international ? 
   so take it with a grain of salt . 
  as a matter of fact , she did n't `` denied the charges '' or dismiss the charges as the title says , but did n't prosecute in 2007 due to procedural problems . 
  she did in fact ordered it re-investigated , not closed . 
  ( they say as much in the article , lol ) . 
  she became general prosecutor in 2006 , that file was under investigation for nearly 17 years at that date . 
  to give you an idea , until 2007 iliescu had not been interviewed about the charges even once .
