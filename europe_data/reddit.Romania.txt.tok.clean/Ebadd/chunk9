  in 2007 she dismissed some parts of said file which were obtained illegally and if brought to court would have led to a dismissal of charges . 
  she also ordered that the investigation in the matter continue . 
  if anybody is interested in the legal aspects , the ordinance is here ( sorry , romanian only , google translate works well on it though ) . 
  also , a number of charges had been , to that date , prescribed . 
  she also initiated legal investigation of the lead prosecutor of the case , gen. dan voinea , for how it was handled . 
  the sad part is that they have n't covered this news completely in english . 
  there is time ...  in fact , their boss & owner , dan voiculescu , aka the komodo dragon , aka felix the cat , was a former security collaborator , former oligarch and close friend of dictator ceausescu . 
  as far as collaboration worked with the ex-secret police , the securitate , voiculescu was among those few people that were tasked to help & get trading deals with various nations via state-owned companies . 
  under these circumstances , it was virtually impossible to have this type of task and not be questioned by the securitate , let alone monitored . 
  he was a , quote-unquote , collaborator but not in the same manner as a lot of people might think . 
   he is believed to be one of those who plundered said dictator 's swiss bank accounts after the romanian revolution of ' 89 . 
  superstition , unfounded , anecdotal , and a blind pathological hate . 
  for those who are curious , you could ask [ him ] ( http://danvoiculescu.net/blog/ ) yourself . 
  as for the [ bank accounts ( in romanian ) ] ( http://www.luju.ro/dezvaluiri/anchete/judecatoarea-camelia-bogdan-se-zbate-inutil-dan-voiculescu-a-solicitat-tribunalului-bucuresti-sa-trimita-in-intreaga-lume-comisii-rogatorii-care-sa-identifice-conturile-sale-si-ale-fiicelor-sale-oficiul-national-pentru-recuperarea-creantelor-provenite-din ) and from his [ blog ( romanian ) ] ( http://danvoiculescu.net/blog/2015/06/averea-lui-dan-voiculescu-6/ ) . 
  i do n't trust anybody , neitehr should you , and neither the rest of our countrymen . 
  if the company would 've been romanain , you 'd be spouting toxic criticism all the way , since ieverything is fed on crippled inferiority complex . 
  co2 emissions . 
  this is why xenophilia is dangerous , no matter how you look at it . 
  let 's end the democracy facade . 
  death cult . 
  all religions that worship corpses , pieces of corpses , old people & dead people , in general , are death cults . 
  that fact that people all ` round the world , including * mine * , including * yours * , do n't give a damn about banks in general , it means we 're `` good '' . 
  how about * we * stay out of this mess and face our own domestic problems ? 
  how 's that ? 
  same for opinions . 
  pfff , we do n't protest or lynch our own corruption , from the local up to the highest level . 
  now , with the big brother law , there you go , nothing . 
  how are you expected to be taken seriosly ? 
  or me , for that matter , or anybody else ? 
  forget it . 
   when in * rome * do as the romans . 
    could n't agree more . 
  [ \\* * roma * ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma ) ^ hue ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hue ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hue, 
  i 'd rather say a mixture of brezhnev and andropov . 
   that 's incorrect . 
  i 'll wait for the counter-arguments . 
   economists are in agreement that deflation is bad . 
  which ones , the keynesians or the neo-keynesian monetarists ? 
   please try to look some scientific articles i 've looked for everything that was possibly be seen regarding deflation , disinflation , stagnation , inflation , staginflation , hyperinflation & hyperstaginflation . 
  i 've come across a lot to be certain on these . 
   instead of using your limited knowledge . 
  now that just hurts my feelings and it gives me the impression of `` you are romanian , i 'm a foreginer , therefore , i am right no matter what you say and write '' . 
  on the other hand , til : human instincts , survivalism & life is `` human knowledge '' . 
   when deflation hits , people start to think that is a myth . 
  people will continue to buy products to eat or satisfy their other needs ( aesthetics , tools , entertainment , internet etc ) , they will continue to buy gas in order to go to work ( what , do you honestly think they 'll travel to work , if they needed a car in the first place ? 
  wait when the weather is rainy or `` cats n ' dogs '' ) , they will buy that washing machine because the faster they get it , the better they 'll throw the old junk at the junkyard that is n't efficient any more ( why would they be a glutton for punishment ? 
  ) , they will get that new tv because why on earth would they stay with the same old tv ( just to `` save time on price '' ? 
  it 's a risk as well , people will never be certain if next month or the next year will be deflationary ; look how gas was during march & april in the west ) , they will continue to buy clothes , they will continue to pay taxes ( the beauty of it is that , the lower the taxes , the chance of finding a balance in which a lot more can actually pay taxes that simply go bankrupt or sell ) a.s.o. 
  tl ; dr humans are n't sentient beings that can live without even the most basic elements/factors/products / tools there is at our disposal to make our live comfortable just to save some money for the next month ( s ) . 
  also , [ this proves even more economic eloquence on deflation and why the myth is absurd . 
  ] ( http://pifflelab.com/2012/07/22/computers-the-1990s-you-paid-how-much/ ), 
  it also proves that `` civilisation '' does n't equate `` brains '' . 
  we 're a colony . 
  why the long wait ? 
  forging the pieces & assemble them ( though unlikely ) on a grand scale or because of bureaucracy ? 
   our family what family ? 
  smh . 
  sure leech , you go your xenophiliac way , everyone else 's going their way . 
  remember to bend over while cleaning shit ... or stealing , heck , for what i could know , you 're going for stealing . 
  also , you 're too narrow-minded and too blind to understand why isis and the russians need to destroy each other . 
  of course , you 're just a germanophile , you only know to abandon and submit into subservience . 
  remember : bend over . 
   yes , because you 're one of the many primitive human beings that make this country rot . 
  huh ? 
  what 's that again , xenophiliac ? 
  you , the germanophile , a wanna-be traitor , is blaming others ? 
   of course.the common sense card.you did n't even let me have my share of discussion in order to prove my point and you start talking about the lack of common sense you think my comment has.but you already proved the part you cited for me with your close-minded thoughts . 
  * yawn * point proven : common sense is outside your reach . 
  for you , free speech is `` fire !, 
  fire !, 
  fire '' in a theatre . 
  what a leech ...  since you 're too blind to see it , i 'll make it clear for you.the key word is `` ancestors '' . you did n't do anything , your ancestors did . 
  here 's the culminating point , nitwit , and you better have sight to read this : ** they fought for ** *** us *** ** to live better than what they 've been living for , surrounded by enemies , in their respective age and era . 
  ** you understand that ? 
  *** they fought for me and for others *** , just so we 'd exist . 
  * you * , on the other hand ...  wake up , wannabe soldier !, 
  the war is over.europe is peaceful now and we 're willing to help each other.there 's nothing to fight for.but i wo n't waste my time explaining to you things this complicated , your brain cells wo n't be able to handle it.by the time you will see the fist of greediness that leads this country , i will work with people who actually care about the abilities i have and wo n't steal from my salary , unlike the politicians here.you and the other golden dawn lovers can rot here for all i care , until you realize ethnicity does n't influence your life goals . 
  greedy?oh no no no , kid , you got it all wrong.i want back the money that were , are and will be stolen by the corrupt fucks that lead this country.look at moldova how they protest for their country and money back.what do people like you do?kiss pictures of stefan the great or burebista.when this will stop , the brain drain will stop as well.and people will enjoy their country more . 
  anything else to add , leech ? 
  or are you still occupied to learn german and move to germany because `` panzers , bier , work , blut und stahl ! '', 
  you do n't deserve the life our ancestors fought for , you ungrateful leech . 
  whomever close to you read those comments of yours , would rather have you dead than alive for such desertion . 
  you and others like you . 
  and you know it . 
  maybe this corbyn guy watches [ ollie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y1ya-yf35g ) . 
  if you do this without a clear and lawful purpose , you will be thrown in jail . 
  it sounds ambiguous . 
  \\ - { p } : hello and good day , sir . 
  why are you holding your gun , out in the open ? 
  \\ - { c } : well ... 
  i feel protected that way . 
  \\ - { p } : uh-huh , alright sir , you can continue your endeavour . 
   social programs that help people sorry for the offtopic nitpicking , however , i thought switzerland was , somehow , like the american system for retirement . 
  or did i understood it differently that part ? 
   i used the word in the sense of `` to authorize , approve , or allow '' not `` to impose a sanction on ; penalize , especially by way of discipline '' . 
  you know ... a word can have multiple meanings . 
  using words to apease for equivocation does n't imply that , what * you * understand , it shall be understood by others . 
  because , you know , everybody with a clear , normal , head on their shoulders do n't embark on complexities ( why should they , you 're not impressing anybody ) & see the word `` sanctioned '' for what it really is , outside of your wooden language ambiguity . 
  change the word . 
  using the wooden language out-of-context outside of what you , only you , understand does n't make you smarter , on the contrary , it makes you a pretentious half-ass .
