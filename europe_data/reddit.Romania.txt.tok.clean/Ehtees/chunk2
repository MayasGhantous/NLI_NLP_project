  my friend used to troll me with this guy and now he ended up liking him . 
  stare = literally rape, 
  if you want your country to go to shit , just be putin 's friend . 
  just like you op . 
  cured my dota addiction with a wow addiction between 2006-2010 . 
  in 2006-2007 i was addicted by both . 
  i wish i could relive those years again . 
  i miss being an altoholic and questing while listening to streams and vloggers :(, 
  i know perfectly what you mean . 
  i can relate to this . 
  i do n't , nor do i want to . 
  it 's really difficult to explain , but the way things are now , i have these feelings of `` what the hell am i doing here '' and unease . 
  it feels unstable and unwelcoming , like nothing good ever came out of it . 
  i wish my country spawned in a place that 's easy to miss on the map , like iceland . 
   sorry if that 's a bit harsh no , that 's actually great . 
  indeed . 
  there 's much work to be done . 
  hopefully this time there 's no russia to ruin everything again . 
  romanians ' fault , obviously . 
   i think it could be some eastern european immigrant . 
  i think you are some kind of retard . 
  shit like this does not happen here . 
  bugger off you cunt . 
  bucharest , but a lot of these things happened to me while traveling and in the 90 's . 
  my neighborhood used to be a lot worse back then as a bonus . 
  the rock throwing things are recent , and gypsies seem to do them [ a lot . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovzc65dpink ), 
  unfortunately i do n't know too much about it . 
  all i can say is that most of them became abandoned after the fall of communism . 
  a lot of them are now inhabited by the old/poor and they have no interest in renovating them . 
  this is bad because most of them were damaged in the '77 earthquake , and they have no chance to survive another big earthquake . 
  some buildings were also in the process of being built , but after shit hit the fan in 89 , the projects were abandoned , like [ this ] ( http://bucharestian.com/sights/entries/2010/1/9_stupidity__the_palace_of_the_parliament_and_other_crap_files/shapeimage_7.png ) and [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/hunger_circus_2.jpg ) . 
  some of these abandoned projects with domes are today known as `` the circuses of hunger '' . 
  the 2nd one no longer exists and was demolished some years ago . 
  not surprised in the slightest . 
  http://i.imgur.com/56isod1.gif i do n't recall going to pictures of cities/zones from my country or any country and thrash the people from them , like a clueless retard . 
  there are however some cunts in this thread who clearly did this . 
  get a grip , kid . 
  oh god . 
  shut the fuck up already , will you ? 
  i like the [ song of this band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvmhulym-nc ) from your country . 
  my bro listened to behemoth a lot . 
  commies ruined everything . 
  dad was listening to led zeppelin and deep purple in secrecy . 
  not kidding :(, 
  always 2-3 cunts stirring shit up , coming up with outrageous arguments because of their internal frustrations . 
  just do n't scroll too low . 
  believing people on the internet is not my specialty . 
  especially when it 's an obvious russian who poses as a german . 
  give me a break and bye . 
  a german obsessed with russia . 
  right . 
  since the ussr 's influence kind of caused this , yeah . 
  we are actually . 
  seeing your post history clearly shows you are a putin asslicker from russia who speaks no sense . 
  yup . 
  you clearly do , showing your recent posting history . 
  why ? 
  to meet cunts like you with a superiority complex ? 
  i 'm just gon na assume you 're trolling now . 
  i did . 
  what now . 
  true . 
  i assume it 's worse than iasi . 
  such flawless unbiased argumentation . 
  how could i ever refute this ? 
  who gives a fuck ? 
  that was not even my point . 
  pretty much every region in romania is culturally distinct . 
  as for being economically distinct , there may be a distinction but the word `` very '' has no place in it . 
  in the end they 're still moldavians and represent moldavia . 
  by your logic , moldavia and transylvania do not even exist . 
  where do you people come up with these retarded world views ? 
  i wonder what might that be . 
  bucovina is in moldova and the people living in it are moldavians , just like banat is in transylvania and the people living in it are transylvanians , just like oltenia is in wallachia and the people living in it are wallachians . 
  ca n't believe there are even people who need this explained , it 's as if they never stepped in a fucking school . 
  and no , your nationalist convictions whatever they may be , do not change facts or warp reality . 
  plos, 
  it 's a district in which communists congregated gypsies and factory workers to live together . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.ziuaveche.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ferentari.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.cotidianul.ro/images/stiri/0613/1372485722fere.jpg ) is how it looks like after the workers fled the area after the fall of communism and only gypsies remained . 
  me and my family 's experiences with them and only with them : slapped for no reason , got spat on for no reason , got a small rock thrown at me for no reason , had small rocks and ice thrown at the windows of the tram i was riding ( happened several times ) , had my bike stolen , had some iron bars and vegetables stolen from our yard , my dad got scammed several times through buying broken stuff from them , my brother had a firework placed in his cap by some when he was a kid , had our car 's windscreen , audio player and wheel trims stolen several times , had my footballs stolen twice from under my nose , my uncle 's bag was cut with a knife while he was shopping , the uncle of my cousin got hit by one in the head with a shovel , had his bike stolen and now he 's slightly ... traumatized psychically , my dad refused to have the car 's windscreens `` cleaned '' by them ( because when they do it , they actually make the windscreen worse ) , so they threw all the dirty water in my dad 's face and into the car . 
  i occasionally get woken up by them in the morning at 8 am when they drive around in shitty carriages carriage pulled by really skinny and neglected horses , while they shout about buying iron/metal scraps . 
  once i noticed two gypsy teens pickpocketing a girl 's bag right in front of me , and when the 2nd kid saw me that i observed how the 1st one was pickpocketing , he pushed me away and told me `` what are you doing ? '', 
  with a shit eating grin on his face . 
  and of course there 's other stuff i observed that did n't affect me directly , like countless pickpocketing ( and even police catching them in action and cuffing them ) . 
  their kids are also almost never supervised and they fight and flail around in the middle of the street , knocking down people and causing disturbance . 
  they 're also illegally selling stolen stuff in public spaces ( even public transport ) . 
  police always comes and sends them away , but they just move 100m away and start selling again . 
  that 's like saying `` suceava is in bucovina , not moldavia '' . 
  lmao . 
  i should 've stopped reading after the first sentence . 
  how damn predictable . 
  as always , you are free to leave . 
  i was on topic . 
  was pointing out his hypocrisy when he implied that his city is devoid of corruption . 
  so i linked to a news piece of how a gypsy clan bought a hospital for children , and evicted all the patients and doctors out of it . 
  you do n't see this sort of stuff in bucharest . 
  sounds like the typical shit you see in the comment section of eastern european nationalistic/patriot videos on youtube . 
  true . 
  but i was talking about this blind politician worship by the commoners on a huge scale .
