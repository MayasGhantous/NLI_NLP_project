  fixed . 
  reminded me of ceausescu and what my parents went through . 
  just thinking about how it would be to be born in that period gives me a feeling of anxiety . 
  how the fuck is the `` gypsy mafia '' a wallachian import ? 
  jesus fuck , you 're stupid . 
  i agree that overall transylvanian cities are better looking . 
  they are rich of culture and historical events . 
  but the circlejerk needs to stop , because bucharest is not that bad . 
   there are other former soviet bloc capitals which have n't been turned into total shit holes , like prague , budapest , even warsaw . 
  your point is ? 
  does n't change the fact that i pointed out at all . 
  warsaw was completely demolished in the war , for your information . 
  that 's why it looks like an american city . 
  nope . 
  according to brits , they 're all in england . 
  http://www.carucubere.ro/en/ or `` hanul lui manuc '' which is an actual inn from the 18 ` th century . 
  or you know , he was a commie puppet just like the guy before him . 
  last i checked , romanians did not invent this architectural style , and bucharest was good looking before the commies came . 
  and no , that does n't look better at all . 
  they were all industrialized/communistified the most . 
  there were lots of plants/factories in cities like craiova , galati , ploiesti , and if you 'll google them , you 'll see what i mean . 
  there 's not much to see there , just a bunch of gray buildings everywhere . 
  bucharest is a fine example of this because a part of it was demolished , and you can see lots of differences between old and new . 
  [ palatul sturdza ] ( http://www1.pmb.ro/pmb/bucuresti/poze_bucuresti/foto%20vechi/palatul%20sturdza_l.jpg ) was demolished and replaced with [ this . 
  ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/bucuresti/images/b/b2/palatul_victoria.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080214120632 ), 
  this is about bucharest , not the rest of `` wallachia '' . 
  there is a huge circlejerk around this kind of stuff over here . 
  for example baia mare is not a nice looking city at all . 
  and bucharest is not as ugly as these guys want to kid themselves that it is . 
  this is some soviet shit going on here . 
  glad this no longer happens in my country . 
  * sees flair * yeah . 
  move along . 
  indeed . 
  my dad used to hide his hair in a cap/hat all the time , even at work . 
  he also listened to `` radio free europe '' in secrecy and collected magnetophon tapes with jimi hendrix , led zeppelin , santana , deep purple , etc. 
  he was really crazy to do stuff like this during that period . 
  i searched in the whole thread for a serbian in hope of seeing this . 
  diicot ( directia de investigare a infractiunilor de criminalitate organizata si terorism ) are those masked armed men dressed in black that knock at your door if they find out that you take part of organized crime . 
  alina bica was the chief prosecutor of this anti terrorist/anti organized crime directorate . 
  well they are , in other countries . 
  sort them out . 
  what were they expecting ? 
  they had the huge opportunity to live in a peaceful place without any rampant violence going about , and they kicked it away . 
  good riddance . 
  remove caravan, 
  you give them food and shelter ? 
  you do realize that those shelters will be turned into scrap pretty soon , and giving them food will only make them want even more free stuff , right ? 
  see sweden , what a bunch of morons you were to `` educate '' us some years ago about integrating gypsies , when you clearly have no idea what the fuck are you doing . 
  you ca n't handle `` your '' muslim problem either , just like we ca n't handle `` our '' gypsy problem . 
  apparently , you also handle gypsies a lot worse than we do . 
  so kick yourselves out , because you seem to be the ones who are pissed about everything so much . 
  implying that if your country gets invaded , the citizens wo n't attempt to flee . 
  what a pathetic cunt you are . 
  we 're coming ... . hnnggggh . 
  half agree with you . 
  we should n't turn to anyone though . 
  not western because they are n't rich and arrogant , of course . 
  yes sweden ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ... yes, 
  only eastern european nations that oppose russia because they 'll probably be in the same situation . 
  we saw how much ukraine was protected after they were disarmed by their nukes . 
  in romania most people do , from my experience . 
  you get laughed at if you have a gigantic bush . 
  personally i consider trimming/shaving the armpits hygienic , because it retains smell even after i wash it like 4 times . 
  hopefully my district well be less shitty now . 
  ah , i know . 
  i was just trying to make him feel guilt . 
  `` you 're shit and ca n't survive on your own , but you need us , so you better do what we say and appreciate us , har har har har '' . 
  hmm , wonder who the fuck that reminds me of ? 
  ah yes , russia . 
  just prettier and cleaner . 
  no one complained here about any restrictions in the uk , and no one cared either . 
  keep your restrictions but please shut up . 
  last year ? 
  you must have not heard about the very recent documentary channel 4 has made , that started a gigantic controversy here in romania . 
  so why do you accept them then , and blame it on romania ? 
  do you expect us to imprison people here , like during communism ? 
  so then brits can make a documentary about `` primitive eastern europeans imprisoning people into their own country , like in the 80 's '' . 
  oh , that 's right . 
  it 's always other people 's fault . 
  yawn and fuck off . 
  brits are the ones bitching about them most of the time , especially ukip . 
  it only makes sense that people will point out stuff like this , what the fuck did you expect ? 
  got ta love those people hating on romanians in the comment section . 
  the fuck ? 
  they have a different culture i do n't want to associate myself with . 
  i have every right to not associate myself with them . 
  it 's not a coincidence that nobody wants to deal with them . 
  it 's impossible . 
  even western europe ca n't , as much as it liked to pound its chest . 
  i have a house in a village not for away from bucharest . 
  it translates into [ `` the vortex '' .

  let me guess `` no '' and some retarded unrelated garbage as an argument . 
  i 'll take usa soldiers over russian ones any day , so long as their intentions are good of course . 
  it 's not like we have a choice , anyway . 
  i do n't want history repeating again . 
  eh , depends what you mean by worst . 
  craiova has a crime problem . 
  cities in general are not that bad here but some small-ish towns are .
