got it from that site i linked earlier . 
  the wiki source 404s , and if i google for the 1930 census i only get endless tables that need some serious pruning . 
  meanwhile , [ here 's a nice map ] ( http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/ ) which will help you see exactly how much multiculturalism has been lost countrywide in the last 80 years . 
  not just in transylvania , but also in cities like constan\u021ba , ia\u0219i or bucharest . 
  19.3 % nationwide in 1930 to 8 % in 2012 , bearing in mind that the population is relatively the same and that we also had moldova considered for the 1930 census . 
  seems effective to me ... 
   mostly , the process consisted of a demographic homogenization between the mostly hungarian cities and their mostly romanian hinterland homogenisation through industrialisation should not account for this loss of ethnic diversity on a countrywide basis [ [ source ] ( http://vladimirrosulescu-istorie.blogspot.ie/2011/06/romania-date-demografice-si-recensamant.html ) ] popula\u0163ia rom\u00e2niei num\u0103ra \u00een 1919 16.250.000 milioane de locuitori , dintre care 30 % nu erau etnici rom\u00e2ni : maghiari 19,3 % , evrei 5,3 % ucraineni 4,7 % germani 4,3 %  orthodox romanians how about greek catholic romanians ? 
  that 's a religion that 's been almost completely wiped out of transylvania , even though pre-communism it was the predominant one among transylvanian romanians ( and * not * among transylvanian hungarians , as most people seem to think ), 
  drain for what ? 
   harghita and covasna are a huge drain of money common myth . 
  their economy is pretty much average when compared to other romanian counties . 
  the ethnic distribution of transylvania has been significantly changed in the past 60 years precisely through such policies . 
   i speak the language . 
  people do n't realise how important this is . 
  even though ireland is as an alien a culture from romania as two european cultures can get , it still feels way more like home than say hungary , which has almost identical social norms and culture like romania . 
   it 's pretty much the same as encouraging someone to jump out a window because you want to see the splatter . 
  i do n't think that any of the non-british that cheer for scottish independence actually think that the exit would have an overall negative effect on scotland and its citizens . 
  what 's the distinction ? 
  [ honestly , i do n't know ], 
  yes there is, 
  he is a bit obscure though ... 
  it 's summer , drink a fr\u00f6ccs while it 's still hot outside and eat at [ this place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rsfahvd.jpg ) in budapest . 
   the geographical centre of europe is actually in lithuania [ both highly debatable and rather irrelevant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ), 
  because if the world would realise that more often than not luck is a bigger factor in success than business savviness , those executives would n't be paid so much more than the engineers and you average factory grunt =  higher paychecks for employees + r&d =  a higher financial cushion to land on + a lower probability of getting sacked, 
   android may have had front runners but they 're mostly lame htc , lg , samsung , sony ? 
   you ca n't absolve people of responsibility when they get things wrong which they are paid to get right . 
  on one hand , yes , they are paid for that . 
  on the other hand , it 's way too easy to criticise them for being wrong post factum . 
  really , they were intelligent educated executives whose future career depended on the decisions they made . 
  now it 's easy for you or some hobbyist blogger to call them incompetent now that you see how things turned out . 
  but i 'm pretty sure the decision they made at the time was carefully weighed and considered . 
  the original xbox was a microsoft catch-up product and it was rather successful . 
  android already had a lot of big sharks running ahead of nokia . 
  windows phones did have the backing of microsoft and thus the potential to make a dent in the smartphone market . 
  the guys running nokia were businessmen , not fortune tellers .

  it does n't feel like living in europe if you 're not _ allowed _ to leave your country ... 
  i can honestly say that the romanian ascension to the eu has been the single most important political event of my entire life . 
  i do not possess a passport , yet i have been able to live in europe for the last 4 years . 
   wait till you hear the cajuns speak french how many of them actually do actually speak french at home ? 
   the funniest accent ( in my opinion ) is the moldovan accent the one from the republic of moldova . 
  plus , i 'd say that a strong northern transylvanian accent that relies heavily on hungarian sounds like _ ny _ and _ dy _ + lots of regional words is pretty damn hard to be understood even by people from the centre of the country .

  and yes , i did write the initial comment because i was too lazy to phrase a full argument on why i find the idea of monarchies quite obsolete . 
  i did try framing solid arguments and googling the data i was citing here and there .

  yeah , my whole irk was with the whole `` the people are armed =  impossible to conquer them '' nra logic that i felt the argument was tilting towards .

  i 'd bet that if for whatever reason the us and canada would not move a muscle to defend alaska , russia could pacify it in a couple of years .

   last week i read the eu want 's all our coffee machines to turn off after one hour to save electricity that 's not a problem with the eu that 's a problem with the representatives we ( and that includes you ) are electing to the european parliament .

   i find it normal to have a healthy sense of patriotism , an altruistic attachment to a culture and identity and wishing it to continue in good health and prosperity after we are dead . 
  it 's that very `` healthy '' sense of patriotism that makes patriotic proud romanian boys declare that all hungarians should be kicked out of transylvania and those who refuse shot in the streets . 
  a `` healthy '' feeling that i tried to combat many times before and , as a kid with some hungarian ancestry , i had to eat quite some shit for . 
  nobody says forget history , and culture , but really , you being hungarian adds 0 value to your personality . 
  it just means you where randomly born inside one country rather than another . 
  and really , how can you look at transylvania and say that its culture is definitively romanian or definitively hungarian ? 
  nor can you say that there is a definitively transylvanian ethos , given that transylvania was never actually independent and isolated . 
  nation states are a modern concept that sparked more pain and suffering than any other political philosophy in history . 
  that was sarcasm, 
  they do get loads of funds from the developed countries in the eu,
