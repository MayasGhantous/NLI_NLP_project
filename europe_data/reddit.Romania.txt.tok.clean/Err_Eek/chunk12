  look at my flag , it 's not like i 'm some liberal college swedish pot smoker talking out of headlines i read on alternet or something . 
  a. hard to have ghettos when you do n't have immigrants b. hungarians are n't immigrants in slovakia . 
  neither are the gypsies who get treated like lesser humans anyways . 
  c. speaking of hungarians , was n't orban building a wall on the border with serbia ? 
  nothing i said will ever happen , as the central + eastern + baltic block is incredibly xenophobic and not likely to accept any immigration ( with _ maybe _ the small exception of ukrainian asylum seekers ) , the ultra lefties ca n't comprehend that punitive measures need to be taken to insure a better environment for asylum seekers , and the righties ( like the scores here on / r/europe ) ca n't comprehend that muslims are people too and probably we should not shoot them all on sight and that it 's not too much of a bother to give up a bit of your comfort in order to help others in dire need . 
  first idea that pops into my head : first pay the money from an eu budget rather than the state budget and adjust it to the ppp gdp/capita , second -- if asylum seekers get caught in a different country that the one they were initially assigned to they get shipped back to their country of origin and blacklisted from applying for asylum in the next 10 years . 
  it 's harsh but fair . 
  what i ** would n't ** do is just refuse any sort of asylum seekers and feel good about myself while millions are dying in warzones . 
  and that cultural gap is the reason the eu quota system was proposed , to facilitate their integration into our society . 
  now if only the same people complaining about cultural differences would n't be the ones complaining about trying to integrate the asylum seekers ... 
  you 're more inconsistent in your view of a strong leader than merkel is on immigration , fyi, 
  while humming l'internationale , of course, 
  since i 'm indiscriminately and actively not pissing on children regardless of colour , creed or ethnicity ( not even asylum seeking kids ! ), 
  i think you could say i 'm quite the cultural marxist . 
   what ? 
  guess i 'm either joking or actually believing pissing on kids is alright . 
  got quite drunk a few times and i found it hard to control my bladder . 
  managed not to piss on a kid though ... 
  freedom of speech, 
   because doctors are n't selected at birth to be doctors ? 
  why would n't they ? 
  grandpa could teach them to ask questions nicely to their patients , and mommy could teach them about liver diseases . 
   making that potential person inherently political . 
  or you could have [ prince charles promoting medical quackery and getting university staff fired . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2015/03/prince_charles_visits_washington_d_c_and_kentucky_homeopathy_and_anti_gm.html ), 
  we have a sword wielding eagle on ours . 
  would n't want one for head of state , though it would be cool , i admit . 
  why does n't the same hold true for doctors ? 
   now , you may be in favour or not of them , which is not relevant to my comment , but you should view things without a bias . 
  but you see , i ca n't . 
  everyone has a set of basic values , which are the axioms rather than the debatable points of your political view . 
  here 's a thought experiment -- imagine that a study comes along that proves that if a society adopts arranged marriages exclusively it will increase the gdp/capita , the overall hdi of the country , while decreasing wealth polarisation . 
  while i could be convinced that the methodology was sound , and the result accurate , i would still not accept this fact , simply because it contradicts my ideal of people having freedom of choice in their life matters . 
  now , even ** if ** monarchies were a proven source of net profit for a country -- which they are n't -- i 'd still be against having them , since it 's my fundamental belief that a society should at least strive to offer all public offices based on merit . 
  which is exactly what monarchies do n't do . 
  that being said , i understand that most monarchies are supported by their people , so i ca n't do much else but sigh and move along after i complained about them for a bit . 
  also getting quite a bit of schadenfreude when i 'm reading news about them not living up to expectations . 
   you and i can get shitfaced every other week and nobody gives a shit . 
  take advantage of that privilege . 
  on the other hand , once my contract expires , if i ca n't get a new job , i 'll be homeless . 
  that problem would be compounded tenfold if i had kids depending on me . 
  i 'd rather take the risk of tabloids talking shit about me hunting elephants on a safari over the anxiety of having a rather insecure future . 
  it 's an extremely biased account . 
  it 's not like tourists will stop visiting the uk just because there will be a lower probability of the queen waving at them . 
  [ here 's the opposite biased argument ] ( https://republic.org.uk/what-we-want/monarchy-myth-buster ) . 
  i know he was n't . 
  but it makes just as much sense as any hereditary transmitted job -- that 's what i was trying to emphasize . 
  look , i 'm not a fan of dictatorships either , but i need to say there are some advantages . 
  in a lot of democracies , like poland for example , prime minister has little power of action and he often does more harm than good . 
  having a dictator that has absolute power for a longer period of time , who is also by definition a doer has some appeal . 
  that sounds like eleanor had the hots for marines, 
  well , country borders are n't that rigid when it comes to culinary things . 
  and the concept of fried fried cheese exists , but ca\u0219caval pane served as the centrepiece of a meal , with its grounded dried breadcrumb crust is n't something i 've ever seen outside of romania & hungary ( though i suppose some of our other neighbours might have it ) . 
  watched it years ago . 
  i thought it waaaay too long and kinda boring . 
  the intro is cool , some of the setpieces are pretty retro chic in a bioshock sort of way . 
  but the story is basically victorian science fiction , no surprises there . 
  i thought [ m ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022100/ ) was a way better fritz lang movie , with more mature and deep themes . 
  and peter lorre 's wonderful acting absolutely still holds on today more than 80 years later . 
    valens responded with the calamitous decision to march his imperial army against the goths  better to die fighting than face a mass influx of cure loving crow fanatics . 
   ...  had to try . 
  not necessarily my favourite but i really like [ ca\u0219caval pan\u00e9 ] ( http://www.gustos.ro/assets/recipes_images/2010/04/22/51555/e7df99446b8833f5e5d41a3ca4d8ccaf_1_.jpg ) ( deep fried cheddar ) . 
  generally the cheapest thing on a restaurant 's menu , but i unapologetically love it and i 'm a bit bummed western europeans have n't discovered it yet .

  not sure how amazing . 
  i can only think global warming , and the only thing on the frontpage of google contradicting that idea is an ultra conservative blog ... 
  dunno , but a glance at west germany and japan vs countries that fell under the soviet sphere of influence should be enough to make one realise that in spite of the carpet bombings and nuclear weapons , the americans where the best nation to be beaten by in ww2 . 
  yes the argument is definitely silly . 
  and yes , both nazism and communism were incredibly damnable and destructive . 
  well , we 're playing schoolyard _ my dictator vs your dictator _ here , so i 'll go with the flow and use [ this random image i found on google ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/eyunc ) . 
  at a first glance you might notice hitler 's frag count ( 17 mil ) is only 73 % that of stalin ( 23 mil ) , which might make him a little punk ass bitch that does n't even belong in the same room as stalin . 
  _ however _ , if you look at the ( total killz ) / ( time in office ) ratio , which shows you how much of a vicious motherfucker one can be in the unit time : hitler -- 1.54 mil/year stalin -- 0.74 mil/year which makes hitler more than twice as murderous as stalin . 
  booyah for hitler !, 
  at least you have to admit it was a competitive match-up ... 
  you 're right , i would n't . 
  because it would most likely be because one of the big nations decided to get overly bellicose , rather than the fact that an overly bureaucratic and ridiculously inefficient organisation was disbanded to make room for a better successor . 
  amazing how the un can stop ww3 but could n't stop the butchering of tutsi or bosniaks or north koreans etc etc, 
  safe to say it 's pretty much not working , really . 
  governments are n't allowed to also chip in for the interns ? 
  yeah , i bet all those un ambassadors get paid minimum wage , like . 
  to me it 's quite amusing when i see an english person say how the two countries are so similar and the irish just uncomfortably not confirming nor denying but quickly changing the topic . 
  i 'd say they 're as culturally set apart as two european nations can be . 
  when 's the last time you said `` thank you '' to the bus driver for simply driving the bus in croatia ? 
  i could go on a 4 page rant on significant differences after only spending 4 days in croatia . 
  downvote . 
  there actually are 15-17 year olds caring about politics without their parents wanting to liberalise them by force ( also do n't forget that young people today are way more liberal than your average 40-50something year old ) . 
  i was a bit undecided , since i 've yet to meet a teenager with a pertinent opinion about politics , but then i realised it 's a irrelevant to this case . 
   well , let 's just say there 's a reason many germans marry polish , romanian and hungarian women :d yes , there is , and it 's not that german women are more ugly . 
   first you say that you are more represented as a larger country , then you say that small countries have better chances of having a higher proportional score . 
  make up your mind , for as the statistics show , you do n't in fact have batter chances of being better represented . 
  it 's representative . 
  which means that the 0.2 estimation for romania is more accurate than the 0.5 estimation for latvia . 
   i have no idea what you mean with this . 
  what i meant by that is that larger countries from the eastern bloc have relatively similar values , while the smaller ones tend to pop outliers . 
  because they 're small . 
  it 's how statistics work . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure what you thought i was implying in this thread . 
  matches the overall 50 % to 100 % population growths in europe more or less . 
  what 's skewing the irish numbers more the 4 nobel peace prizes because of the northern ireland thing . 
   but i did n't meet anybody that is not using internet more or less regularly plenty of the poorer people over 50 do n't use it .
