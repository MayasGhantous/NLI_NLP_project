  you 're basing your estimation on the people you know . 
  which makes for a highly biased sample . 
  my point was that romania always had a much larger population . 
  so if you 're looking for rare events , romania will always be more representative than a small country like latvia , simply because it 's got more people . 
  look at the faroe islands comment from above , since it 's got a population < 50k , its ratio of nobels per capita is insanely high by having exactly one laureate . 
  or , if you do n't believe me , look at how wild the variation in values within the three baltic states compares to all iron curtain states not named hungary . 
  and i do n't think i 'm overshooting by saying that most likely lithuania is and was more culturally and politically similar to estonia than ukraine is and was to bulgaria . 
  again , i 'm not saying this map is the best indicator ever , it 's clearly not . 
  but i do think that it offers a ** very rough ** estimate of the scientific throughput per capita in countries within the last century . 
  my bad , checked the chart from the 1800s rather than the 1900s . 
  still , we 're kinda comparing outliers here , unless we get a chart that gives us the distribution of population growths in europe per country within the current boundaries ( so we control for the even more significant population changes that result from redrawing boundaries ) . 
  such a chart is a bit hard to find though . 
  and no , i 'm not saying this map is the most relevant piece of information ever thrown on / r/europe . 
  but it is relevant to a certain point . 
  historically speaking sweden has produced more quality scientific output per capita than an average eastern block state . 
  now whether it 's the higher gdp , the smaller effect of the world wars or the soviet union , or surstromming the map does n't say . 
  if it did , it could indeed offer only a useless answer . 
   according to the map of this topic , romania is more of a statistical noise than the baltic states how come ? 
  so did france 's , uk 's , spain 's , etc etc, 
   population boom we did have was not the positive one well , to be fair , the three baltic states are statistical noise when it comes to comparing an event as rare as nobel prizes . 
   and were stuck repairing the damage for a long time , while others were able to move forward already . 
  yes , there are a lot of factors at work . 
  including lumping in nobels for peace and literature together with stem nobels , controlling for scientists that did their nobel work in a different country ( like our own george emil palade ) , variations in state policies throughout the century etc etc. 
  and most of these factors count for way more than the relative population change throughout the years within the current considered state boundaries . 
  would n't mind inflating the romanian nobels/capita with the austria-hungary nobels ... 
  yes , looking at charts poland sure lost a significant chunk of its population in ww2 , which would make the poland nobels/capita less representative than for other countries . 
  [ not sure where you got that from ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_austria#/media/file:population_of_austria.svg ), 
  not that useless since the ratio of populations within europe has n't changed * that * dramatically since they started handing out nobel prizes . 
  libre office is a mess . 
  even stuff like page numbering or adding equations is needlessly complicated , and the documentation is a bit lacklustre . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm writing this from a debian machine and i try to maximise my use of open source software . 
  i 'm just realistic about the computing needs of the other 98 % . 
  the average person uses microsoft office , though . 
  did n't triple check , i 'm just going with what [ this says ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c11xv/reurope_is_now_a_default_subreddit_for_europeans/ ) . 
  now brb , got ta stockpile for the civil war with the filthy migrants . 
  wow , such in depth analysis . 
  and a link to a solid wordpress blog . 
  i guess this sub really has gone to shit since it 's been made default . 
  uhm seth rogen , willie nelson , tommy chong etc, 
  \\  tries to immitate a minnesotan accent, 
   but you are putting marseille of all cities against it ? 
  taxi, 
  some people do . 
  it 's not a big thing if you forget , though, 
  same with marseille  paris cork  dublin cluj  bucharest [ ... ] the eternal complex of the smaller less cool city, 
  ... abortions are still illegal , tho . 
  afaik , the dutch and the germans are kind of unique in europe for owning up to the evil shit they did in history . 
  the irish famine is not really emphasized in british school history , the extermination of gypsies and jews is barely mentioned in romanian history books , and i 'm sure the list could go on . 
  only tangentially related , speaking of dutch ww2 and collaborators , [ i 'd recommend this film ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/ ) . 
   what more is needed ? 
  not reducing ww2 to a black/white story about evil hitler that convinced people to do evil things , and then good people coming and cleaning shit up . 
  i would think that for society to truly progress we must all accept that our ancestors were capable of , and quite often did some shady shit . 
  sweden however ... 
  if the size of the city does n't matter than why is london a bigger tech hub than say . . bath ? 
  well , it 's eu 's 54 ` th largest city , so yeah , 16th per capita on any list puts it quite ahead . 
  yeah , low taxes and low red tape bring here a lot of multi nationals , but there 's also an active effort to support start-ups . 
  i threw an eye over that report , and dublin was 16th based on some index that measures r&d , business and innovation . 
  and by seeing karlsruhe and leuven up there i 'd say the index is heavily biased by the presence of tech universities . 
  but then again , i live in dublin , so i have a pro dublin bias . 
  edit : [ googled ` start up cities eu ' , got this ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2014/11/09/seven-european-start-up-hotspots-to-watch/ ) \\ \\ o /, 
  your comment has more solid points than the article linked . 
   the majority of the employees we had were immigrants to the united states , not just people moving within the country . 
  it 's more about the language barrier than the flag over the city hall . 
  it would be easier for me to adapt to california than poland , even though poland is more geographically and culturally close to romania . 
  except 1/100000 of those tulips end up being google , facebook , paypal , amazon , netflix , steam and all those companies we just ca n't seem to produce in europe , even though we 've got good programmers , solid social protection programmes , state funds for businesses , etc etc etc. 
  literally the only two internet companies that i can think of the top of my head that came from europe are skype and gog , in spite of this continent having double the population and a larger total gdp than the us . 
  i do n't think it 's just an issue of culture and europeans being less risk averse than americans . 
  i am pretty sure that a huge problem is the lack of mobility inside europe . 
  it 's way harder to convince a very good estonian programmer to move to move in an apartment in barcelona and start coding than it is to convince a winsconsinite to move to san francisco . 
  i also think that it might be the reason that dublin is such a tech hub -- it 's in europe and english-speaking . 
  in spite of having some seriously shitty weather , it can easily attract workforce from all over europe simply because most moderately educated young europeans have at least a basic level of english . 
  the same can not be told about german , french , spanish , or any of the many national languages we tend to impose strongly . 
   so no , it 's nothing like that . 
  kinda is , read the list , human trafficking , murder , racketeering . 
  things that make being dirty and pickpocketing a mere nuisance . 
   it 's obvious they are not integrated in any country because europeans are still to be blamed because of something that happened 400 years ago or because of `` reasons '' ... again , bismarck could have made the ** exact ** same argument about poles 150 years ago  how about countless documentaries , people 's experiences , police records and etc ? 
  you mean using google like you could have to find out about succesful roma ? 
  maybe even read about how crime rates vary in socially polarised environments ? 
  how crime rates vary with the wealth of a population ? 
  really , i 'm not trying to sell you anything that 's further than a handful of unbiased google searches away ... 
   do they involve [ they seem to involve a lot of dodgy shit ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=polish+site:thesun.co.uk&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1618&amp;bih=989&amp;ei=8gocvygtb4lp7gah94hyba&amp;start=10&amp;sa=n ) [ oh , lithuania is here too , do n't worry ] ( https://www.google.ie/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=utf-8#q=lithuanian+site:thesun.co.uk )  i believe the problem comes from their communities being so closed and backwards i.e. 
  being poor  being part of this culture that puts strong emphasis on family ties and medieval style hierarchy that has been corrupted over centuries and punishing members by scaring them with banishment for not `` being part of the community like everyone else '' why do black people give their babies `` black '' names ? 
  why do irish travellers speak in the thickest accent known to man ? 
  poor communities tend to become insular and defensive , they always have and always will . 
   the only successful gypsy individuals i have seen were those who did not grow up in a gypsy community well , i 've never seen a successful lithuanian . 
  but then again i only know 1 lithuanian ... gee , i guess personal experience does n't count for much . 
  and also that social exclusion can be a motherfucker when you 're striving for success . 
  i grew up next to gypsies . 
  they were just poor people . 
  poverty makes people shitty everywhere , from brazil to india to usa to mexico to south africa regardless of the `` cultural traits '' of a given people . 
  bismarck was in no way less ( or more ) correct in dismissing the poles of the xixth century than you dismissing modern day roma . 
   many documented repeating incidents around europe there are many documented crimes around europe that involve poles and lithuanians . 
  implying ` culture =  crime ` opens a big can of worms that is not at all favourable for any country that laid behind the iron curtain . 
  trying to combat a risqu\u00e9 joke with a purely racist argument . 
  think you 'd like it more on / r/european, 
   how the fuck could n't you know about kissing on cheeks , everyone does it here yeah , but first you need to close the reddit tab and get out of your mom 's house ... 
  i for one really like karelian pies . 
  fuck gordon ramsay and his pretentious cuntishness, 
  borscht is not hungarian b\u00e1bguly\u00e1s , sour cherry soup , and dozens of others are, 
  you 're * really * * really * underselling hungarian cuisine .
