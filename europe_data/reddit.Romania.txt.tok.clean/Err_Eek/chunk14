  it has quite a variety to it and it 's undeniably flavoured , spiced and incredibly tasty . 
  \\  implying i 'd ever leave dublin #romanianjackeen, 
   one does not have to be a `` right winger '' to promote the unity of his country , dude . 
  well , for your ideal of unity only implies the romanian ethnics . 
  i am not one for shitting on the rights of minorities until my country reaches my ideal of cultural homogeneity . 
   like , i get it , you 're more equal than us in the south , that 's what this is all about . 
  on one hand , i did not even vaguely imply that anywhere . 
  on the other hand i would not expect a logic conclusion coming out from someone as needlessly aggressive as you . 
   where you are currently , do you say you 're `` transylvanian '' , or `` romanian '' ? 
  romanian . 
  however , if the conversation goes on i will mention i 'm a romanian from transylvania , since , you know ... that 's where i 'm from . 
   but not completely separated from the rest of us that statement would be perfectly sensible if one would ignore the commonly accepted definitions of * autonomy * and * federation * . 
  also not take into accound any shred  should i change my flair to a wallachian one , too ? 
  if you wish . 
  wallachia exists , you live in it , your choice whether you popularise your overall country or just your reason . 
  and except you and a couple of other hardcore ultranationalists , nobody will look too much into it . 
   no , cause i identify with a romanian from oradea just as well as i identify with one from my neighbourhood in bucharest ( iancului ) . 
  funny thing , culturally i 'd say i have more in common with people from my own town . 
  it 's almost like culture is a fine gradient of nuances rather than the homogenous soup uber right wingers like you dream of ... 
  yes on both . 
  extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence , but who needs that when you 've got your gut feeling and common sense ? 
  however it 's people like you spewing hatred does make the life more difficult for normal transylvanians who can easily live with hungarians . 
  ^ just in case anyone is still wondering whether this guy is batshit insane , he totally is, 
   dublin is a junkie-filled embarrassment to what is , despite the crisis , a rather wealthy country . 
  unlike the wonderful rural life of mulingar or athlone or other such beautiful wealthy places, 
  eurostat is telling you , not me . 
  also , bear in mind that the vast majority of romanian companies have their hq in bucharest while only a fraction of the german ones have it in berlin, 
  the range of gdp/capita in various regions of that country, 
  i took the chart from the eurostat twitter account ... 
  and both f\u0103rca\u0219 and lupu are names in romania . 
  when i 'll go to vienna , i 'll pm you so you can take me by the hand and show me one of these mythical creatures . 
  hey , do n't let facts stay in the way of some good old xenophobia . 
  once i met an austrian who swore there were third generation immigrants in vienna who did n't speak any german . 
  better version expat : you come from a rich country immigrant : you come from a poor country, 
  i thought this was about desserts !, 
  you should make a separate post with the top 10 eu myths, 
   ** staring into the abyss **  the euro crisis might wake europe up . 
  but more likely , argues edward carr , it will lead to compromise and decline [ [ sauce ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21536872 ) ] quoi ? 
  you sure like dem big words , al. 
  fyi , yes , i had to google hagiography . 
  also just because the economist does n't want the whole continent nuked does n't make it pro eu, 
  guess which my favorite british newssource is  ps : the economist is euroskeptic as fuck, 
  i can tell you they are way more similar than hungary and the czech republic, 
   in the greece of today , a country gripped by economic collapse and paralysed by political uncertainty , more and more users of expensive medicines are finding a healthcare system that ** had problems even before ** the eurozone crisis hit is close to disaster . 
   ** despite a government promise ** to make cancer drugs available , people said they were still unable to find them . 
  to me it seems like it 's mostly corruption and poor management from local officials rather than that mean old $ that just wants greeks dead . 
   wearing down the independence of individual nations citizens that 's funny , last time i checked you had a right to vote and the right to free speech . 
  i do n't see the eu rushing to shut down the telegraph or the daily mail . 
  or explicitly forbidding that referendum of exiting the eu . 
  shit , it 's even a few steps away from declaring internet access a human right . 
  dude , google russia . 
  you 'll see what wearing down the independence of your citizens really means . 
   but as much of what they said would happen actually did happen , their views are now taken much more seriously . 
  that 's on par with saying nostradamus predicted 9/11 . 
  for real, 
  i never said you should n't have a referendum . 
  in spite of what that nigel farage-loving flakwolf there may say , the eu is and always will be a democracy , nobody is * forced * to stay . 
  as for staying in the eu , i really wish you would , since personally i 'd love to move to london in a few years , as much as i dislike driving on the wrong side of the road  as for the sensible argument , i 'm sorry , i 'm a bit low on wall-of-text-writing fuel right now , but the general idea would be : economic poles are shaping up in the world , with china and brazil and india moving up , and no state in europe will be an industrial powerhouse by itself . 
  yes , a shitload of national pride has to be thrown out the window to make the eu work , and it 's gon na be tough as fuck to wind down 150 years of nationalist propaganda in every single state . 
  i 'm no economist , but it would surprise me a lot if this continent could survive the 21st century with closed borders and a fuckton of currencies and taxes on trade and exchanges and other such lovely things we had in the past century ( and still have plenty of ) . 
  i believe that a working economy also needs to have a relative mobility of the workforce , mobility which has been achieved to some extent in the high tech domains . 
  also , i admit , there 's my personal bias , i 've lived in three eu states so far , and i fucking love the fact that i need n't do more than wave my id card to prance around europe . 
  i never felt that kind of freedom growing up . 
   medicine shortages in greece caused by the euro o.o [ citation needed ] there buddy . 
  minimum wage greece : $ 683.76 ( also a bit less than my dad makes after 30 years of working ) minimum wage bulgaria : $ 148.28 also the two countries share an open common border , in case your geography is shaky . 
  they can trade, 
  no , they just make me occasionally think i 'm suddenly reading posts on / r/cringe, 
  i 'm an europhile myself , and i really dislike it when i see someone just blatantly slur germans or repeat the same buzzwords ( debt , loss of sovereignty , apparatchiks , troika ( the new mot du jour ) , bureaucratic colossus , southern states = source of all evil , etc. ) . 
  it seems to me like this is the typical mo : post anti-eu/euroskeptic article from the telegraph/the economist -  criticize every argument that points to a bias -  rant about debt and how the germans enslave us all . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i like the uk , london is without a doubt my favorite city in europe , i read your media quite often ( yes , even the economist every now and then ) , read british authors regularly , yep i 'm pretty much an anglophile . 
  however i do find that the incessant euro-bashing that makes its way in almost every single thread in this subreddit ( see flakwolf above , or al_gorithm , or atheistmil ) to be quite annoying and ridiculously repetitive in arguments . 
  really , the equivalent would be a handful of french/germans posting on / r/unitedkingdom stuff about how the uk is gon na go to complete shit because some scots want out of the uk or reminding you about your imperialist * past or point to the comments section of the daily mail and then complain about racism . 
  really , do you find it that annoying that people in the eu can travel visa free and do whatever they can so we can have more trade between nations ? 
  plus the eternal catch 22 in your argument : you agree that more federal laws are needed to stabilize the economy , yet you dismiss federal laws as german/french bullying . 
  -- * fyi , when i hear some of you complain about the cultural diversity in europe , i swear to god it sounds like you 're still dreaming about the pax britannica, 
  whoa , you 're economically savvy , aintcha boy ? 
  i 'm pretty sure in that case the french and german state both lose in case greece is n't able to reboot its economy and pay its debts . 
  wrong . 
  doom predictors predicted greece out of the eurozone and the eu in 2011 . 
  and 2012 . 
  or the break-up of the eurozone when hollande became president . 
  really , it 's like not another day goes by without some right winger yapping about the loss of sovereignty and how that will kill us all . 
  yes , greece borrowed too much . 
  if the eu had jumped in and forbade the borrowing , right wingers like you would have cried about infringement of national rights , yadda yadda . 
  instead the eu bailed it out , tried to jumpstart the economy , and there you are again , euroskeptics crying about senseless handouts being dispersed for nothing . 
  yes , i know you want a wall built around that country , so it could just rot off and die . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's just now how the eu works . 
  you want cheap nationalism -- try the far eastern europe . 
  easy on the big latin words there , tiger . 
  let 's call it the boy who cried wolf effect , when if your source makes shit predictions too many times , you just start ignoring it when it predicts disaster * again * . 
  plus the whole damn article is ridiculously opinionated and obfuscating, 
   yeah , i do n't think german economic theory cares about that . 
  there is no such thing as * german * economic theory . 
  only a debate on how to fix the economy . 
  debate to which everyone participates ( see [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13o1rw/infografic_the_battle_for_the_eu_budget/ ) ) . 
   40 years is not young , and it 's no excuse for a bureaucratic mess that wants to be everything to everyone . 
  it 's also not enough time to convince people to lay off 150 years of nationalistic indoctrination . 
  you just need more people to move between the states of the eu and more federalisation in order to get people who consider themselves first europeans and then [ insert nationality here ] than vice-versa . 
  you 've got ta admit , it 's way easier for people to buy the `` germans are attacking our precious sovereign country again '' than `` we 're all in this together , and you 've got ta become buddies with that [ insert nationality you dislike most ] there ''  true , but there 's only so much you can do with limited democratic options . 
  there 's also the huge problem of ignorance , misinformation and outright lies that no one has any solution to .
