  putting a cross every four years on who lies better is just a less horrifying way of running a country then others . 
  as a person raised by people who lived in a repressive communist regime , i 'll have to remind you that you have a right to vote and the right to criticise your government without any fear of reprisals . 
  granted , you can always have more transparency , accountability , and less corruption -- but that 's what you should be able to get with the right to vote and the right to free speech . 
  do n't downplay their importance , please . 
  plus the populares afaik were a force in the roman republic not in the empire . 
   yes it is , so is portugal and greece for the next couple of years . 
  after that ... just better would be kind of hard not to get , i think . 
  still , it 's hard to complain that you 're being oppressed when the borders are as open as they can be . 
  no individual state benefits from the plight of the other , in spite of what your average marxist/anarchist publications may tell you . 
  a poor neighbouring state is a poor market , and a poor market = poor trading opportunities . 
   the parliament does n't have much power , or teeth . 
  that 's because people shit their pants when they hear that evilest of all evil words : ** federalisation ** . 
  hopefully that 'll change . 
  the eu is still very , very young . 
  as for politicians , they 're scumbags everywhere . 
  and we elect them , so we too are to blame for their shortcomings , imho . 
  it 's just easier to see ourselves as victims than as enablers . 
   so , no , romania is n't magically going to get better because it 's in the eu , just like the eu is n't doing much to avoid the return of fascist and nationalistic ideologies . 
  but ca n't you see ? 
  it already did !, 
  yes , it 's far from perfect , but compared to the 90s it 's heaven . 
  our borders are n't no longer prison walls , our only neighbor that has a higher standard of living is hungary ( with the wealth gap between the two states decreasing ) and so on . 
   it has nothing to do with hitler , but she 's unelected to rule europe the european members of parliment are elected . 
  and each country has it 's own voice heard , and in many issues also a right to veto . 
   and now they want to enshrine the neo-liberal pov as the only type of policies that member-states can have . 
  * cough , cough * hollande  many countries seem to be passing reforms to lower representation , in portugal a lower number of mps is an idea that 's been making the rounds , along with a huge round of gerrymandering . 
  higher representation = higher taxes on the people . 
  whether a small government is desirable or not is another issue of debate , but there 's no way you can seriously say it 's a precursor to autocracy . 
  in fact , all autocracies are supported by a ** massive ** government . 
  either way , it 's another issue of debate, 
  did n't you hear ? 
  merkel is literally hitler !!, 
  yes ... strange . 
  either way , the poster at the cinema said untouchable ( singular ) , i 'm sure of that . 
  also the word * intouchable * does n't seem to exist in english ... 
  intouchables was translated as the untouchables in english . 
  also no bruce willis in it :(, 
  yeah , i found that to be the best deal in town as well . 
  also after a year apparently i do n't need to pay extra for 3d films anymore . 
  man , if i could send you a beer through reddit , i totally would, 
  please read : http://fistfulofeuros.net/afoe/more-like-colmar-on-thames/, 
  vontroll , i hope you end up making many europhile babies , that 'll go throughout europe , marry persons from different states , and do stuff that will cement this weird albeit pretty damn cool eu we 've got here . 
  as for the article , just look at the phrasing : * the threat of the euro 's collapse has abated for the moment * -- there was never a serious threat , only panicky markets and newspaper that capitalized on that * his socialist party remains unmodernised and hostile to capitalism * * at stake is not just the future of france , but that of the euro . 
  * -- i already made a $ 10 bet with some guy on / r/europe that no country will leave the $ zone any time soon . 
  anyone else willing to sponsor my drinking habits ? 
  * mr hollande does not have long to defuse the time-bomb at the heart of europe . 
  * -- time-bomb ?!? 
  shit , i 'd better start stocking food cans and gold . 
  truth be told i do n't read it religiously , but i 've yet to read a pro euro article on the economist , instead it almost flooded the internet with articles about the potential greek exit from the $ zone ( which has n't happen , and wo n't happen any time soon ) . 
  somehow i find it that the guardian is the only british newspaper that can keep a cool head with regards to eu affairs -- also the only one that mentioned 6-7 months ago that 78 % of greeks did * not * want an exit from the $ zone . 
  they 're not relying on oil resources or anything like that to maintain it . 
  in spite of my disdain for certain elements of the french culture , i can see nothing more in this article but classic economist euro-skeptic propaganda . 
  i 'd appreciate that magazine quite a lot if it would n't constantly engage in eurobashing, 
  worrying about downvotes ? 
  just write : `` the euro is inherently unstable and the eu is way too culturally diverse to be sustainable . 
  we should go back to our old national currencies , and stop letting the ecb and germany dictate what we should do . 
  also , i 'm not racist , but srsly , fuck gypsies '' enjoy your karma !, 
  idk , when you export just slightly less than south korea , and you 're having one of the highest ( if not the highest ) life expectancy in the eu and also one of the best social protection schemes , i 'd say you 're doing quite well , would n't you think so ? 
  do n't know about you , but i 'd never touch a german camembert, 
  will someone eli5 to me what the fuck does `` lack of competitiveness '' mean ? 
  yes , when dealing with the law -- ethnicity and gender are not relevant . 
  citizenship is , since being judged by the law of the land could cause some international tensions . 
  no , when citizens are dealing with their own state , they do have to make sure they 're not being discriminated against based on their gender , ethnicity , eventual disabilities , etc. 
  basically , if some bloke from belgium comes and steals your beer ( because for some reason he/she decided belgian beer ai n't that grand ) , in the end it 's a problem between the romanian state and the belgian state , not between white romanians of romanians ethnicity , and white belgians of french/flemish ethnicity . 
  this whole they 're gypsies not romanians shit has got to end at some point , it 's making us all look like backwards barbarians . 
  romanian passports = romanian citizens = romanians . 
  period . 
   so the hungarians living in romania are also just romanians ? 
  so , no need for minority rights , education in hungarian . 
  that non sequitur nearly gave me a stroke, 
  i think that 's rather common in large cities ( where housing is ridiculously expensive ) everywhere, 
  funny how you get downvoted for making a fair point, 
  if you compare it to hungary , which is pretty much secular state , the difference in income is less significant . 
  also you 're confusing correlation with causation , countries that have a high standard of living will most likely * tend * to become more secular , as more educated people are needed in the workforce , and education can cause a bad case of liberalism . 
  i was a total party pooper and went with 1/2 fino-ugric 1/2 slavic, 
  exactly what i was looking for . 
  many thanks, 
  but students there do n't get to have any pan-european sexytime ... :|, 
   if we lose our languages , a lot of identify and variety will be lost . 
  i like the way people resort to buzzwords like identity , culture and tradition though they 're at best very vague concepts . 
  fyi latin and ancient greek are the languages that define the european culture more than everything , yet i do n't see little samaritans such as yourself rushing to study them . 
   most of them speak well enough english to follow conversations dunno , spent about a semester in france working in an english lab tutoring college kids . 
  there were a couple of really fluent ones there , but the rest ... * shudders *, 
  i 'm just saying that if you wan na do some business with foreigners you 'd better learn some english before expecting them to learn your language . 
  sorry , that 's how this pseudo fascist world works ... 
   and i am glad i missed russian . 
  why ? 
  not only it sounds wonderful , but also russian women tend to be ridiculously good looking . 
  russian would definitely be in my top 5 languages to learn ( if i 'd have the patience of learning another one ), 
  first of all mouse over that little eu flag near my username  as for speaking english in different countries -- i 'm sorry , i 'm willing to learn the language that 's mostly spoken in the region i move in * , but i vehemently refuse to learn the language of every single country i want to spend my vacation in . 
  i just do n't have that much brain power and time and patience . 
  plus , for the whole language learning thing , how come most of you polyglots learn to speak french or german or italian as a second/third/fourth language , but not polish or hungarian or czech or bulgarian ? 
  a. we do n't * all * speak english . 
  and whether you like it or not , english is the lingua franca of the world , the language of business , technology , science . 
  it 's not french , mandarin , german of spanish , and none of these ever will be . 
  b. parts of your culture are lost everyday , culture is changing , adapting . 
  i 'm pretty sure you use a lot of slang that did n't exist 10 years ago , you 're browsing reddit & probably playing videogames , or skateboarding , or playing d&d , or going to a halloween party , or just eating a kebab , all of which are not part of your ancestor 's culture , but are a part of today 's globalized one 's . 
  and you know what , i really like the modern world . 
  i like eating indian food , watching american movies and drinking in an irish pub with people from all over the world and writing all of this on a laptop that was assembled in taiwan . 
  fuck , i do n't shed a single tear for the culture of our grandparents and their grandparents,
