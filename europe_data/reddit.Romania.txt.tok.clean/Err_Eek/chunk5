  hugging and the aforementioned cheeks-touching-feigned-kissing will do . 
  also , this is another thread i 'd like to see on / r/europe , how kissing differs from culture to culture . 
   no , it 's creepy as hell . 
  new years , making out for the first time with a girl i had just met , she asks me when 's the last time i had sex -- which i 'll admit was an uncommon question . 
  as for the creepiness factor , you might be missing a bit of context , it 's not like i 'm asking bartenders what color 's the panties they 're wearing . 
  if i 'm chatting up a girl i 'll wait for her to bring up the topic of sex , which ( provided she likes me ) happens . 
  i 'm glad to hear that . 
  unfortunately i never got to properly visit the balkan region . 
  i 'll try slowly changing that , first by visiting croatia this summer . 
  well , i live in ireland and the best buddy i 've got here is from bristol . 
  so i 'd actually say that in as much as two european cultures can be different , we are . 
  here 's just a few things : - touchy-feeliness : romanians are _ way _ more touchy feely than the brits and irish , even northeners such as myself . 
  while someone explains something to you , expect to be touched frequently on the shoulders , maybe even your knee if you 're sitting - it is way more ok to talk about sex with a girl you just met in romania , and generally to open yourself about how your sex life is going with friends . 
  during my first month in ireland i went to a house party , the conversation started moving towards films , and i made this joke about the movie shame `` michael fassbender wo n't make you feel self conscious about having a small penis , he 'll make you feel self-conscious about not having a third leg '' . 
  i thought it was pretty funny , but everyone else just pokerfaced instantly . 
  - kissing . 
  when i told my english buddy that when kissing i also like to kiss girls on the cheek and forehead he got truly creeped out . 
  told me that 's totally verboten and uncool , something you 'd only do very seldom with your wife after years of marriage . 
  - my english buddy : the answer to `` how are you ? '', 
  should always be `` fine '' . 
  - talking on the train with strangers , while with the arrival of ipods and smartphones became less and less common , is still perfectly acceptable and happens quite often , it 's generally not seen as something one would rather avoid . 
  - shaking hands : not something you do daily around here in ireland , unless you 're introduced to new people daily . 
  many a romanian did not realize they were being awkward for weeks , while shaking the hand of everyone every time they showed up for work in the morning - swear words : the romanians are the bigger prudes here . 
  while i come from a rather foul mouthed family , there are plenty of people ( especially girls ) that will avoid even minor swear words at any costs , and all tv programmes in romania bowdlerize maniacally the translations of various foreign shows . 
  there 's even a [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuxqu9j9da ) about how absurd this practice gets . 
  - sex : modern girls in urban environments in romania will be ok with sex on the first date . 
  but there still seems to be a general cultural stigma attached to female sexuality , the word `` curv\u0103 '' ( whore ) being used way too often and way too freely . 
  the list could go on and on , two and a half years worth of office talk and small moments of awkwardness . 
  but hey , _ in varietate concordia _ , 
  the general consensus about poland here is that it 's a country like ours that got it 's shit together and consequently does better than us . 
  unfortunately we do n't know much more about it . 
  romania ( some may be typical to transylvania ) : - if you 're a male every time you meet a guy you know you have to shake their hands . 
  not too limpy , do n't squeeze too much , just a cordial manly handshake . 
  if you 're leaving a bar it 's good manners to shake hands with all your male buddies unless topologically inconvenient - with some girls you might have to feign a kiss on the cheeks ( both sides ) when you meet them . 
  it 's only a light touch of the cheeks -- do n't be the creepy . 
  some girls will do this all the time , others only after not having seen you for a long time . 
  generally it 's the girl that dictates the cheek-kissing-thingamajig - always take your shoes off when you enter somebody 's house . 
  they will always insist you should n't , but unless their house is a bona fide shithole , take your shoes off - if you 're somebody 's guest and they offer you a drink but you do n't want to have one , there 's only two acceptable excuses : a. you 're driving & b. you 're pregnant . 
  anything else might be mildly offensive . 
  - answering a `` how are you '' with just `` fine '' might seem like if you 're explicitly trying to avoid a conversation with someone . 
  just answer by briefly stating what you 're doing ( `` well , just having a sunday stroll '' / `` well , just buying veggies for my space capybara '' / etc ) - you 'll notice people get significantly more touchy-feely and outspoken as you go southwards . 
  also older people tend to be significantly more chatty on public transport , while the youth will generally keep to themselves . 
  and old people are way more touchy feely than younger ones , it 's like people who grew up during or after the 90s suddenly needed more personal space . 
  you probably never heard of the pure energy given by the resonating auras of a thousand hippies singing songs of love, 
  look , i upvoted your post for that very sad last paragraph about not fitting in . 
  the part where you 're insisting you 're italian is just bs . 
  it 's like me insisting i 'm hungarian just because i 've got a hungarian last name , even though i do n't speak any hungarian , do n't follow hungarian news , i just happen to pass through hungary once or twice per year when i go visit my family in romania . 
  then there 's the `` america is diverse '' part which we hear so often . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't , i 'm just saying you get a bigger culture clash if you 'll drive a few hours south to the baltic states , than you 'd have if you were to fly from alaska to louisiana . 
  as for not quite being a local ... takes time and patience . 
  if i were to move to the us , even though my english is pretty decent and i 'm knowledgeable about american culture , it would take me a while to be able to fully call myself an american . 
  i 'm an immigrant , and as much as i like the country i live in , i still ca n't call myself irish yet , but i 'm definitely _ more _ irish than when i first landed here . 
  my advice : learn the language , go out , learn the language , go out some more , learn the language , go out even more . 
  [ take that back !, 
  the last poster is absolutely retarded . 
  well , first of all i rarely use office suites , but here 's a couple of things : - inline equations in powerpoint - equations that do n't require learning a new mark-up language - exponential & logarithmic & polynomial & power function curve fitting in excel - non-obfuscated page numbering that does n't require using google, 
  also see stuff like adding page numbers , the fact that the default fonts have shit support for diacritics , the fact that you need to learn a new markup language if you want to add an equation to your document , de fact that you ca n't have inline equations in impress -- and this is barely scratching the surface, 
  dude , i 'm an f/oss fanboy myself , but i think one needs to be a bit realistic when it comes to evangelizing . 
  everybody who works an office job hates ms office , but i have yet to meet a single person who prefers libre to it and does n't know what an open source program is . 
  well , to be fair word2007 was a massive improvement in terms of usability . 
  quickly afterwards openoffice tried to implement some ribbon based interface , but that ideea was quickly scraped , so for the past 15 years oo writer is basically the same word 97 clone with the shittiest equation editor know to mankind . 
  as for wymiwyg ( i.e. 
  latex ) , there has n't been any noticeable change since 92 . 
  and it would be absolutely inhuman to force average office workers deal with overfull hboxes, 
  but what to replace it with ? 
  open/libre office is an absolute mess that 's nearly unusable, 
  paging / u/russiandynamo for the russian side of the story, 
  it was a false rumor that was taken as fact by the rest of the media . 
  unfortunately , it 's still illegal and way more frowned upon than in most western countries, 
  dude , i was just joking . 
  honestly , i do n't think any less of the dutch ( or the portuguese ) for having chosen to decriminalise personal drug use . 
  in fact , i think it 's a rather good policy . 
  even if i 'm not french and i barely speak the language i still find it extraordinarily hard to believe that the typical parisian accent has n't changed in the past 70 + years, 
   why did n't i think of that ? 
  drugs probably ? 
  one needs to balance out the drugs i guess ... 
   everybody is entitled to an opinion . 
  and i formed my opinion on you based on your opinions about what constitutes a hero and a model for our society  some express it in a civilized manner , some ... 
  some express civilized opinions in an uncivilized manner , others like you do the exact opposite, 
  you should go hold hands with / u/chodechugging , ya nazi twat,

  you 've got some poor mothers to send back to pakistan meanwhile, 
   try to reformulate that in a coherent question first . 
  why do n't the jobless immigrants leave even when given extra incentives ? 
  now give me an answer without the super mature insults you like throwing around . 
   you hypocrite [ que ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sjhoe/the_netherlands_tells_immigrants_to_learn_dutch/cdy999a )  you 're denying those people political rights and social security . 
  no , i 'm giving them way more rights than they are given now , and want to make it way easier for them to become full citizens . 
  you 're the one pissing his pants when he heard about giving them health care , and you want to expatriate them en masse back to sudan , pakistan , somalia and other such lovely paradises . 
   the chinese i know this puts that handful of neurons of your to work , but we are debating different aspects of the immigration issue . 
  you where blurting out the fact that cheap labor is inextricably linked to a lowering of the standard of life , which i pointed out to you -- is false . 
  it 's amazing how the only time you point to sources you 're doing it while derailing from the main issue . 
   no , i 'm perfectly alright with allowing people to study here to practice a profession they will be succesful in because there 's a shortage . 
  inb4 : ` there . 
  labor . 
  shortage . ` pro tip : if you 're going to blurt out whatever idiotic statements happen to cross that vacuum you sport in your cranial cavity , at least make sure those statements are n't contradictory . 
  2 ^ nd pro tip : all caps are almost always a bad idea . 
   for good reason : the quality is less . 
  red herring + shoddy grammar  and are therefore limited to the dirty work you claim is a guaranteed parth to prosperity .
