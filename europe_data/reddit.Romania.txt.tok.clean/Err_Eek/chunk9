  country where i 'm pretty sure that nationalism is not caused by mcdonald 's taking over k\u00fcrt\u00f6s kalacs stands as much as people being jobless and rather poor without significant prospects of improvement . 
  again , i wish the people downvoting you would bother to give counter arguments . 
  and i 'll go give one : by all accounts amazon is one of the most efficient and highly valued companies that exist today . 
  just check the p/e of the stocks -- that shit is immense . 
  however , in order to achieve this status it went through some pretty unprofitable years , and if i recall correctly it did almost go tits up a couple of times . 
  fedex is another such example . 
  now these companies survived their formative years due to the sheer balsyness of their founders . 
  however companies that no longer have their initial board , but people who are in it for 2-3 years might be way more incentivized to just cut their losses and focus on short term profitability , in spite of the company having a much better outlook if one would just tighten the belt for a year , or two , or five -- especially during times of recession like the one we 're going through . 
  more or less . 
  i can buy a company , sell it by bits , get a an overall profit for the current year , fire employers , and declare bankruptcy next . 
  now i 'm definitely richer , but the people that were expecting either paychecks or stock dividends for the following years are fucked . 
   1 ) there is a social hierarchy largely independent from the state . 
  this condition is already met in most countries  2 ) those on top of said social hierarchy should be public-spirited the * should * is the key term . 
  as a state you ca n't really force them to become public spirited in the direction you want , without having a progressive taxing system , which by design is antithetic to the libertarian principles . 
  also , if the said rich people want to invest in things that are not necessarily considered a public good by many ( e.g : tom cruise starts building scientology centres everywhere ) you have the base of a civil unrest that will topple your little utopia in a matter of minutes . 
  with the state 's expenditures however , the citizents can more or less influence the directions of the investments with their vote . 
   historical evidence shows us that before the state did it , schooling , healthcare etc. 
  was a church business e.g. 
  in the middle ages . 
  historical evidence also shows us that literacy rates skyrocketed in places that had state funded schools . 
  cf : post-tsarist russia . 
  and that state expenditure where you consider education and healthcare a fundamental * right * of the human being quickly gets transformed into a more efficient , evolved and overall happy population in a generation 's time . 
   you should not feel dominated by foreginers far away over whom you have no control . 
  again that * should * implies some sort of increased import tax or local protectionism rather than letting the absolute free market do it 's thing . 
  which is anything but a libertarian principle . 
   whenever people are insecure about their country 's safety , economic independence , international prestige and rank , there is a strong incentive to `` close ranks '' , leading towards the desire for strong-arm leadership , nationalism , a siege mentality that always ends up with leading to statism , not libertarianism . 
  i 'd say people turn towards nationalism mostly when their country is in economic shit . 
  nobody care 's about those brown people cleaning their toilets when they 've got plenty of cash to spend on partying . 
  i find it very annoying that you got downvoted for a purely informative non-biased answer,

  he 's just our resident racist dickwad from / r/romania . 
  nobody likes him over there , so occasionally he spews out his racist diatribes on / r/europe as well . 
  please do n't pay any attention to him . 
  as awesome as that pandora thing seems to be , it does cost 540 $ , which makes it more expensive than a ps4 . 
  with that kind of money i can buy a pc that plays all those games and streams hd films oh yeah , and / r/europe   / r/worldnews , ofc,

  you 're right, 
  yes, 
   poor eastern european [ ... ] probably know half the us states you 'll be hard-pressed to find one who can point a couple of us states on a map , let alone name half of them . 
  really , they 're in no way more common than americans that can name half of the countries in europe . 
  the only europeans i 've met that knew a lot of states were british & irish -- guess it 's the intertwined history and stuff,

  add a few + and = signs and it will make some decent physics, 
   what kind of cars to romanian orthodox priests drive ? 
  depends on the priest , really . 
  but some of those cars are pretty fancy, 
   it 's clear to every european had you stepped into any halfway-decent european university you would have seen a perfectly working and peaceful multicultural environment . 
  but go ahead ... have kids with your cousin , silently approve of breivik 's stance and live your idyllic life, 
  ^ 100 % legit because some dude that does n't like foreigners said it on reddit, 
   and please spare me a lecture on european multiculturalism . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  i really wish i would n't live on the same plane of existence with xenophobic fucks like you, 
  really , there 's _ nothing _ to stop a romanian/bulgarian to go begging in any eu country + switzerland/norway . 
  fuck , i do n't even have a passport , and i live in a non-schengen country with just my id card . 
  so spare me the bs , the only ones stopped from moving are the hard working people that need to get a thousand work permits just to be able to clean a fucking toilet . 
  because gypsy balkan scum can not into nordic beauty, 
  nobody would force norway to feed them and house them . 
  however it would force norway to allow eu citizens to travel freely and make it easier for many people from bulgaria/romania to work in norway . 
  moreso , even though bulgaria & romania are n't members of the schengen area , those roma you 're so afraid of can enter norway legally , and all those that wanted to be in norway already are there already . 
  the bulgarians & romanians ( roma or not ) that want to work there face an extra wall of bureaucracy , and are thus disincentivised to go there . 
  it surprises me that norway has a say in it , given that it 's not a member of the eu, 
  i know the feeling, 
  lol 'd . 
  tough i 'm sure plenty of my countrymen actually believe attila was hungarian, 
  i would be pro such a union . 
  but i also think this should happen organically , and in time . 
  doing it now would just frustrate masses not willing to give up their `` sovereignty '' , `` cultural values '' , their `` national identity '' and other such vague and hard-to-define concepts . 
  unfortunately , there 's a very limited number of europeans willing to be neighbours with people who do n't speak their native language . 
  no amount of regulation will make them less faggy, 
   stop making assumptions about people you do n't know meanwhile in the previous paragraphs you 're totally not doing that, 
  i find it amusing that a guy who probably never lived outside of his home city constantly berates everyone who mentions they 're from transylvania for separatism, 
  dunno about the wrong flag -- transylvania is a region of romania last time i checked . 
  i 'd also say someone sporting a scottish or welsh flag should know a thing or two about british curse words . 
  or someone with a bavarian flag ought to know german ones as well , no ? 
  i was born and raised in romania , i spend my holidays in romania and i chat almost daily with romanians -- most of them quite foul-mouthed , mind you . 
  except the last two i have n't heard a single one of those ever in my life . 
  also : flair up,

   anti-semitic hate is more-or-less gone save for a few continental countries like romania romania is not really antisemitic . 
  basically because it already did a too good job in [ murdering ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ia%c8%99i_pogrom ) and [ selling ] ( http://forward.com/articles/2923/the-cold-wares-strangest-bedfellows-how-romania/ ) the ones left unmurdered to israel . 
  basically there are n't many jews left in the country . 
  also , romania is not really islamophobe , but it will hate the shit out of gypsies . 
  but then again , so do western countries . 
  which is where we 're having this conversation, 
  seen a couple of people on / r/polandball with transylvanian flairs,
