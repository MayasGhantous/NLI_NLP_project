i am sure the christans provoked the peace loving muslims by ... you kmow ... breathing ... let 's all gather around and keep chanting : this did n't happen , this did n't happen , this did n't happen . 
  otherwise we are all racists . 
  only the one they brought with them, 
  better soundbite, 
  or it could be 8, 
  it 's 5 points in one month , that 's a lot ... and the majority has not yet reached germany yet, 
  so instead of letting them do damage someplace else you keep them locally and allow them to do damage here ? 
  what do you figure it 's most likely going to happen with them ? 
  will they suddenly stop being extreme muslim fundamentalist shitheads or will they actually recruit more shitheads for the parade , start planting bombs , etc ? 
  what could possibly go wrong !, 
  how are you going to make them stay ? 
  just whisper in their ear from time to time that it is illegal for them to leave ? 
  that 'll work just fine !, 
  last i checked romania got 6100 not 4000, 
  so they do that against the interests of it 's own citizens and nation ? 
  topkek !, 
   as a last measure , authorities can confiscate suspected islamists ' passports under certain conditions to keep them from leaving for terrorist camps in syria . 
  why ? 
  they want to go there , fuck it , let them !, 
  but if they try to come back , shoot them on sight as enemy combatants . 
  yep , they will integrate just fine !, 
  i am so glad to see we are being successfully assimilated to a barbaric culture ... 
  i think he forgot the / s, 
  if your statement would be correct , then looking at this chart we should consider people russia as refugees also . 
  source for that ? 
  which means they can very well apply and wait for asylum in their own countries , not force their way in ... 
  eritrea , iraq and afghanistan are not currently refugee-status countries, 
   values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities yes , why are we refusing to accept people coming from a culture which is opposed to every single one of these values ... 
  not the op but here you go , look at the eurostat tweet and graph : http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/19/eu-statisticians-claim-only-1-in-5-migrants-are-from-syria-5398412/, 
  yep , forgot the bread, 
  did you even bother to read the title of this post ? 
  croatians , serbian , romanian , hungarian ... basically it 's meat on meat with a side of meat and potatoes . 
  would she have had the same media coverage if she was promoting a balanced diet ? 
  `` but it 's illegal for them not to stay in ee '' / s, 
  yeah , what possible reason could the guy have for lying . 
  he did n't want to hurt people , he just took of head first into the crowd ... 
  please , when somebody rams his car into you , be nice and remind him he is breaking the law, 
  is there an invasion of blonde blue-eyed men at the gates of europe ? 
  but of course , we all ram our cars into a group of people when we are scared !, 
  totally legit !, 
  he passed a police barrier with the police standing there . 
  he knew the street was closed 2 . 
  he was warned , which is why at the beginning the got out of the car and got aggressive . 
  how would that go exactly ? 
  `` oh , look , there 's this guy trying to run me over with a car . 
  i should politely tell him that 's not nice ... '', 
  oh , do tell !, 
  so what is the the difference between a terrorist act committed by a second generation migrant vs a new migrant ? 
  [ totally ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/14/refugees-confounded-merkel-close-german-borders ) [ opened ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/09/germany-closing-its-borders ) , [ dude ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/14/migrants-queues-build-at-border-as-germany-suspends-schengen/ ), 
   you 're the one that asked if it matters if the terrorist is newly radicalized or not because you are the one who said `` oh , but those are just the old guys , not new guys '', 
  background story : the guy drove his car through and into an organized and approved protest on a closed down street instead of driving on an adjacent street and turn the corner . 
  are the 13 people dead in columbine less dead because they were shoot by white boys ? 
  are the people the ira killed less dead because they were killed by something other than muslims ? 
  yes , i can build strawmen too . 
  unless we are seeing a mass migration of blonde blue-eyed men , american teenagers or ira goons apt to be radicalized , from a culture that glorifies death , killing and violence and with a proven inability to deal with frustration , bringing them into discussion is utterly pointless . 
  so why have you now closed your borders and dumping people on counties that do n't want them nor do they want to be in ? 
  is that how `` ethics '' works with you ? 
  if one of the new radicalized people plants a bomb , would those that die be less dead than if it were a ready-terrorist ? 
  russia , the land of the free, 
  by all the accounts less than half the migrants from this wave come from war zones . 
  the rest come from pakistan , bangladesh and the like . 
  anyway , your logic is amazing : people who are desperate are less likely to try to get to a country illegally than people who are not . 
  totally dude , which is why when they get to the first safe country they register there . 
  but lets not get reality get in the way of fantasy, 
   and then they will receive no housing , no financial assistance and no healthcare except emergency healthcare . 
  which is why there is no illegal migration in germany from the balkans , which is why there was no illegal migration from eastern europe . 
  the rich will get richer the poor will get poorer . 
  the people who have been allocated to eastern europe will run away almost continuously , from time to time they will be caught , returned , the country where they left from , who have no means to stop them ( as they are not prisoners to be locked up ) , will be billed by germany for the processing and return of `` their '' migrants . 
  we 've already been in this movie with the gypsy , it will be the exact same thing . 
  the british media will find new reasons to act all appalled and horrified at the conditions and benefits the migrants are getting , forgetting to mention that 's how half the population is living . 
  the leftist bleeding hearts will put on their best holier-than-thou hat when some will be proven beyond doubt to be economic migrants or up to no good and returned to their country of origin . 
  the migrants themselves will be miserable when they realize that in e. europe life is somewhat better than their own country , but not by much . 
  they 'll still have to learn the local language to get jobs . 
  so yeah , good times ahead . 
  adn i hda ablosutely no prlobrem unerdsanding waht u siad . 
  i am not 100 % certain they are wrong and apparently , neither is the [ german intelligence ] ( https://news.yahoo.com/german-intelligence-concerned-islamists-recruiting-refugees-102046365.html ), 
  why does n't she just appoint somebody to run greece to germany 's liking and be done with it ? 
  this is getting ridiculous !, 
  how about eu allocates the funding they need for border controls ... 
  do you really not understand the difference between letters and letter elements such as the accents or diacritics ? 
  also , there is a big difference between the pronunciation and letters of alphabet in writing . 
  for instance the is not pronounced ze , just like letter is not pronounced leter . 
  if we are to move to phonetic writing , we would need to add elements ( from [ ipa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet ) ) not remove them . 
  or france , or spain or italy or belgium or denmark ... basically 80 % of europe ... 
   mr zeman 's post is a ceremonial one , but the czech government has also been talking tough on quotas . 
  its opposition rests on three central objections frequently voiced throughout the region : quotas would deprive their countries of the sovereign right to decide their own asylum policies they would encourage more refugees to come most critically of all , quotas would not work , because refugees would not stay here `` these people want to go to germany . 
  what mechanism will be put in place to keep them here in the czech republic ? '', 
  the czech interior minister asked recently . 
  ** these are not unreasonable arguments , perhaps ** . 
  the view from central europe is that , so far , their western colleagues have been unwilling to hear them . 
  it 's that ** perhaps ** that makes this article pure art !, 
  god forbid we actually address those concerns !, 
  much better we should write an article about how central europe is just full of racist bastards . 
  do they have a point , meaning is there actually something lost in the sense of the word by not using them ? 
  imo the answer is no . 
  so why keep using them ? 
  for instance if you look at diacritics words with and without have different meanings . 
  and yet we 've gotten used to going about without using them on the internet and we do n't really miss them , because communication is contextual and you can in fact know the correct word without them . 
  from my knowledge of french the same can be said about accents . 
  except with the majority of sources now confirming that less than half the refugees are from syria , this is not the syrian refugee crisis but the economic migrants country-shopping crisis .
