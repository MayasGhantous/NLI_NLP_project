  syrians living camps in turkey , pakistani , bangladeshi , sudanese ( remember them ? 
  they are part of this wave too ) flocking to europe for economic reasons is totally the same as the jewish fleeing certain death . 
   we can ensure that the long term benefits of migration are worth the effort this migratory population comes with a cultural baggage that is incompatible with our values . 
  but sure , explain it to me . 
  how exactly are we going to benefit from people who treat women as cattle ( or worst ) , glorify the killing of those who do n't pray to the same god as them , stone to death gays and rape victims , find it perfectly suitable for 12yo girls to be groomed for sex slavery and sold into forced marriages . 
   migration has always happened throughout human history actually , with the exception of very strictly controlled migration at the end of wwii and in the ' 90 , a mass migration movement such as the one we 're seeing has pretty much always been violent and in most cases has laid waste to the local populace . 
  if you are going to quote history , do it correctly . 
  in fact , as the enclavisation we are seeing in uk proves , the first wave of these migrants have not integrated and are actively seeing to subdue the locals . 
   they have to be given jobs and places to live so what do you do when you do n't have jobs and places to live as it happens in the case of greece ? 
  do you fire some of your own people and kick them our of their homes to make room for migrants ? 
  what happens when they `` hardworking people fleeing war '' do n't give a shit about working and would rather live on welfare ? 
  honey , ffs . 
  television does not want to show this . 
  i am scared for my sister 's and my niece 's life every day after seeing this : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11805181/greece-migrant-crisis-further-chaos-on-kos-as-migrants-fight-to-board-ship.html . 
  fear is not a logical thing !, 
  do you want to know how many interviews were conducted with the inhabitants of the island after this was filmed ??? 
  none !, 
  you can not have a meaningful conversation if you drown out/ignore half of the story . 
  where you expecting her to name names ? 
  just the fact that she spoke is already proof of guts . 
  i can not get my sister to film her garden in kos because she is afraid they will be identified and the so-called refugees will attack them . 
  nobody gives the people living there a voice . 
  not the media , not the politicians . 
  their voice is utterly drowned on the internet with cries of racism and islamophobia . 
  post this today it will be taken down in a few hours but leftist butthurts with an agenda like out beloved mods . 
  my sister and her husband live in kos . 
  i 've been trying to get him to film and send me a video of how his little orchard and his garden look now after a close encounter with the `` refugees '' . 
  yet when he tried to hire some to help him with the picking he was met with a flat no . 
  i guess $ 500 for 2 weeks of work is nothing to `` hard-working people who have nothing and are fleeing war '' . 
  so far he said he is too afraid to do that . 
  most of the `` refugees '' have tablets and internet access ( funny , no ? ), 
  and he is afraid he can be identified and they will seek revenge . 
  but yes , he is a racist bastard and he deserve whatever he gets ... 
  it 's the opinion of somebody living there who is scared for her life . 
  but yeah , totally does n't add anything of value , because , as we well know , the value is only added by applauding and feeling sorry for the economic migrants horde . 
  do n't be ignorant !, 
  the pro champ is now in lead after the migrant crysis . 
  i remember when i said the migrants will be the end of eu that got heavily down voted . 
  this is proof of things to cime . 
  come on leftist cretins , downvote this as well . 
  what i do n't see is the fishermen and the taxidrivers saying [ `` we do n't want freedom , we want sharia '' ] ( https://youtu.be/rmsu9ex-kjy?t=35s ) or [ detonating bombs killing some dozens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_july_2005_london_bombings ) and none of them have protested [ against other people 's rights ] ( http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/01/08/1227178/563761-d4de3adc-96ea-11e4-985a-7acd3b83aa30.jpg ) ... but yes , it 's exactly , but exactly the same thing . 
  that is because earlier the islamophobia definition was officially changed , from outright calls to violence to so-called `` threatening '' . 
  however , none of the speech and acts in events [ like these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmsu9ex-kjy ) are considered hate speech . 
  [ nor is this considered a crime ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcsg-u2gtze ), 
  when quatar built a similar fence in 2013 i did n't see aljazeera loosing their shit ... i wonder if their financing had anything to do with it ... 
  the only problem is they only started with the increased collection at the middle of this spring . 
  before that it was abysmal . 
  we have the [ highest vat gap in europe ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-14-1187_en.htm ), 
  why do they need 4000 ? 
  100 spread in 10 major cities is enough . 
  [ imagine 50 quasi-simultaneous incidents like these spread over europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_marathon_bombing ) in high tourist areas or in the morning , in underground stations ... or 25 * 2 in the same location , sequential , like the one ira did , where the second bomb exploded in the path of the crowd which was running from the first ( forgot where ) . 
   if we could not use random anecdotes as arguments , that would be nice [ get.your.head.out.of.the.sand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8v7byn_t-g ) ... or maybe i am a magician and i can somehow film anecdotes . 
   the demographic is still too small and too weak to wield that kind of a political power actually , i live in a country where the hungarian minority , which represents 6.60 % , over the past 10 years got large number of concessions ( good for them ) by being the swing vote in the parliament for the past 10 years or so and being needed to form a majority and name the government . 
  so your assumptions that a small group can not yield political power are false . 
   some tension and aggressive behavior is to be expected , it 'll be ugly , it 'll pass i hope that when it is going to happen , it will happen near your family and friends and not mine . 
  i am sure the idea that it will soon pass and all will be unicorns and roses will be a comfort to you in those circumstances . 
   what is it you want , some kind of a perfect society where things never get out of hand ? 
  are now hallucinating ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  do you quite honestly lack the minimal common sense to understand the difference between , for instance , 2 supporter groups of different parties and a mob from a culture which glorifies the killing of `` infidels '' ? 
  but lets do this : go and volunteer for 2 weeks at a refugee shelter and interact with them . 
  then by all means , come back and tell me all will be well . 
  what you do n't know is that 2-something years ago i was you ... before i did what i suggested you do . 
  it was a `` transforming '' experience !, 
  fear is a developmentally sound reaction . 
  fear saves your friggin ' life . 
  maybe it is time we start being just a little bit afraid and start protecting our asses !, 
  not because we are in immediate danger , but because it makes sense . 
  first of all , muslims do n't need to become a majority , just a powerful minority ... a powerful voting minority . 
  after that you will see whoring politicians to start giving them extra-rights in exchange for votes . 
  it will start with smaller things , such as local legislation allowing groups/neighborhoods to dictate the clothing you are are allowed to wear in their areas . 
  next it will be just a tiny bit of sharia into inheritance laws allowing women to be cut off . 
  next , lowering the age of consent and so on . 
  [ the whoring for votes has already started ] ( http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/britains-muslims-poised-be-swing-vote-uk-elections ) . 
  note how , even though jihad is clearly hate speech , nobody is pushing for legislating it as such ... or push to consider it aggravated crime . 
  however , asking for jihad speech to be labeled hate speach is now considered , hilariously , hate speach and `` islamophobic '' . 
  second of all , frustration leads to aggressive behavior . 
  these guys were frustrated over a ferry not coming on time . 
  imagine how frustrated they will be when their expectation of getting free everything will not actually come to pass ... or , worst , if it will be taken away at some point . 
  remember 2005 paris ? 
  we are talking about around 5000 people rioting there . 
  how do you think it 's going to look when there will be 100,000 people rioting ? 
  you should see what they did to kos ... 
  totally ... i faked them in photoshop , nobody was actually there ... 
  heeey , would you look at all those fearmongering politicians rioting [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmsu9ex-kjy ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iq6yxx6gxy ), 
  this is going to be so fun to repost in 2-4 years times when the `` refugees '' will start to riot and impose their shitty culture on ours ... 
  explain it to me again why israel is asked to take in people who basically want to see them all dead ? 
  news.yahoo.com/migrants-using-fake-syrian-passports-enter-eu-border-094700556.html also , using your brain would have led you to the same conclusion : european leader says syrians who make it to germany are welcome to stay . 
  as a trafiker , what is the next logical step ? 
  its not what she said as much as how it was perceived . 
  everyone is faking syrian papers now based on those irresponsible statements . 
  the cost of identifying the good from the fake alone will be staggering . 
  british `` journalism '' at its finest ... 
  my question is why the hell is n't jihad legally considered hate speach ? 
  yeah , lets came back to this statement 2 years from now when the shit will hit the fan and we can laught ... no , not together ... me , of you, 
  heeey , would you look at all the successful integration ... 
  you 've just described the british media ... 
  but ... but think of the children ... oh ... wait, 
  how likely is it for your migrants or their children that , once they 've been there for a while and reality does n't really fit their expectatios , some will turn radical and start blowing themselves up along with whatever europeans happen to be around for jihad ? 
  so what happens if us enters in that war against assad 's forces ?
