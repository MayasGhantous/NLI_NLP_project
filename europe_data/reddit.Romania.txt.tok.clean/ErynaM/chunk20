  it 's not part of our constitution or the constitution of poland or of the czech republic or of slovakia or of hungary or of denmark . 
  and yet germany has been all to happy to bully us into accepting the mandatory quotas . 
  also , seeking asylum is one thing , open border policy is something all entirely different . 
  you can still allow asylum seekers while closing borders like all those nazi states do , like ... you know , canada , us , australia ... oh , and by the way , can we stop with the hypocrisy about not closing your borders ? 
  you had no issues closing your borders to serbians or to ukrainians . 
  you had no problems closing your borders to eastern europeans before we got into the eu . 
  and it 's not like there were hoards of polish or serbs banding into groups and sexually assaulting people and attacking the police . 
   and that society , itself , must be open to some change so in this particular case of mass sexual assaults , what kind of change should society be opened to ? 
  not allow women out of the house unaccompanied ? 
  having women dress in a specific manner ? 
  curfews ? 
  women more open to just giving their bodies away to sexually repressed migrants ? 
  i am yet to hear of any argument why should the receiving society make any changes to itself . 
  actually most europeans go there just to point and laugh at retards . 
   how can europe be safe if an entire minority group is not integrated read what the slovakian president said without a `` he is a dirty racist '' bias . 
  do n't allow said minority group to form ghettos . 
  do n't allow them to form police no-go zones where criminals can find refuge . 
  do n't allow in people with close to 0 marketable skills . 
  do n't give them free cash , lodging , etc. 
  just for breathing . 
  make learning the language mandatory within the first 2 years or residence withdrawn . 
  deport at once if they break the law , not after repeat offences . 
   what happened in cologne would never be committed by african-americans ** cough ** ferguson ** cough ** , ** cough ** los angeles ** cough **, 
  yes : the baltics , poland , czech republic , slovakia , romania , bulgaria , hungary . 
  also ireland and portugal . 
   seems outlandish . 
  where have you been this summer ? 
  the refugees in hungary refused to register as migrants and fought the police , ran away from camps , etc. 
  same in croatia , same in slovenia , and on the entire migration path . 
   do you mean they actually burn all their ten finger tips to avoid registration yes . 
   itself should be sufficient grounds for deportation to where ? 
   impossible if the finger prints are stored in the central register they are not under arrest ( as they should , nor are they immediately rejected asylum , as they should ) once they are re-identified . 
  they are given the papers again , taken to the back of queue , and they just walk out and disappear again . 
  welcome to the absurdity of the asylum process . 
   they would surely cooperate more if we have prevented their pilgrimages cue hungary and the fenced borders to prevent un-registered migrants from entering schengen as the schengen agreements says they should do . 
  cue germany & austria losing their shit over it and calling hungary nazi for it . 
  cue migrants fighting with the hungarian police . 
  cue international media pointing tzz-ing and lecturing said police while fawning of the rights of illegal migrants to go wherever they damn please because war . 
   establishing a central register for all refugees/migrants entering the schengen area central register for fingerprints exists , it 's called eurodac and it 's operated by frontex . 
  getting the `` refugees '' to agree to be registered in it it 's another matter altogether . 
  alas , for one reason or another the local police either does n't have access to it or searches in it take months to process . 
  also a good number of refugees destroy their own fingerprints so they do n't get registered in the ports of arrival . 
   a simple id card to each , which could include finger prints , picture , personal data , bar code or chip that 's the current process . 
  takes months to process the initial paperwork and issue those id 's . 
  it does n't stop the migrants who have little to no chance of getting asylum from throwing those away and re-applying somewhere else to prolong the process . 
   that there are about 300,000 refugees/migrants in germany who have n't registered . 
  nobody knows how many there are in the whole of europe . 
  there 's also a big chunk of those who went missing . 
  what i do n't understand is why on earth do n't we rent some islands from greece and set the hotspots there . 
  fence the beaches , patrol the waters to prevent boats from leaving said islands , move everybody to said hotsports ( as in every-friggin ' - body , even those who are currently awaiting processing in germany , sweeden , as well as the million or so who will come this year ) and process from there . 
  centralize the processing , centralize the deportation procedure , fund from eu coffers . 
  give the migrants a choice after asylum is granted : this country we are sending you to or we put you on a plane and send you right back where you said you are from , war-zone or no war-zone . 
  surely it 's a better solution that dealing with turkey ( as in paying off turkey while they snub eu and do nothing ) . 
  australia is doing that , new zealand is doing something similar . 
  nobody is yelling discrimination at them . 
  so how many arrests out of hundreds of perpetrators so far ? 
   any women visiting the oktoborfest how often she 's being groped do you really not understand the difference between a few stray hands and large groups of aggressive men forcing women to run gauntlet , surrounding them , encouraging each other on , while keeping the police at bay from helping ? 
  the reasonable ones or the moderates got pushed either to the middle or outside of the political spectrum by branding as `` racists '' for being able to reason and ask the harder questions . 
  only the hipsters remain . 
  recent events prove that we are way pass the cliff 's edge . 
  esentially , the migration policy has been let 's just jump and we 'll see what we do when we get to the bottom . 
   i 'm not counting the argument that says there is no hard evidence that these were refugees good , because that argument has been proven false several times over . 
   it 's silly to pretend that the word `` refugee '' is synonymous with the word `` saint '' anyway . 
  til that not committing sexual assault or stealing = sainthood . 
   how could anyone possibly imagine that among a million people from anywhere there would n't be some proportion of nasty , sleazy misogynists the real and relevant question is how big of a portion . 
  but let 's ignore that part the answer is just too depressing . 
   but the fact is this : some people will heavily resist it . 
  that , too , is human . 
  oh , that makes it ok then . 
  i 'll be sure if i am ever sexually assaulted by a group of men to ask them if they are muslim so i can be more understanding to their needs if they are . 
  after all , i ca n't really expect them to ** follow the laws ** of the society that saved their asses and keeps them fed and clothed for free . 
  it 's a cultural thing !, 
   it 's sad that folk are willing to seize on the tawdry , cowardly actions of a bunch of destructive , selfish , dangerous sexual abusers to disparage and traduce her bravery , optimism and humanity . 
  merkel is the one to take guidance and inspiration from , not them . 
  actually , somebody that puts the needs , wants , desires and whims of a foreign population over the local population ( voters , taxpayers , etc. ), 
  should in no way , matter or form be considered an inspiration . 
  that person is at best ignorant and at worst a traitor !, 
  so legal residence can be gained by spouses of different nationalities ? 
  could i see a legal source of that ? 
  i am geniunely interested, 
  no , it 's not be calling the comment bullshit that makes it bullshit , it 's you exaggerating the content of the subreddit while adding nothing worth discussing that makes your comment bullshit . 
   we 're overdoing it in asking those questions so exactly how many days passed before the media gave a shit about this story which , as we can see , it 's actually massive in the countries it covers ? 
  moar moar moar about overdoing it !, 
  i do n't address bullshit comments with substance , i address them with sarcasm, 
  yes , but the citizenship has to be gained first and that 's gained from the country of origin . 
  it 's not eu laws , you should look at italians laws specifically , especially about rights for migrant spouses , etc. 
  the law differs from country to country . 
  in some , the citizenship is automatic for spouses , in some it 's not . 
  one thing i know for sure is that 's not because they are `` scraping by at the bottom of europe 's social and economic food chain '' . 
  there are plenty of poor europeans in europe and yet we have n't seen these levels of assaults before . 
   although german authorities say the perpetrators ' origins are unknown and there 's no evidence linking recently arrived refugees to the attacks . 
  actually , let 's clarify that piece of bullshit . 
  the first official statement came from the chief of koln police and said `` the crimes were committed by a group of people who from appearance were largely from the north african or arab world '' ( among other things ) . 
  this happened on monday . 
  this guy is a state worker and has first-hand access to both policemen reports , witness statements and victims complaints ( important later ) . 
  it was shortly followed by a statement from the mayor ( a politician ) on tuesday that said there 's no indication that this involved asylum seekers ( followed by the famed keep them at arms length ) . 
  that was shortly followed by leaked witness statements and leaked police reports to the media which contradicted the mayor , including the `` i am syrian , you have to be nice to me . 
  miss merkel invited me '' report . 
  if we are to take into account the helsinki police statements , they were in fact refugees from this wave , they were from the shelters , the attacks were planned . 
  similar statements came from hamburg .
