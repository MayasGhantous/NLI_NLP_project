  support / practice fgm ? 
  support honor killings of women for dating ? 
  out !, 
  no , not jail , back to the sharia hellhole you crawled out from . 
  yes , even after your residency has been approved . 
  there has been so much proof already that they are not refugees , including releases from immigration authorities as to country of origin ( which you can see on eurostats or even several on this thread itself ) . 
  and yet the rhetoric stays the the same `` poor , poor refugees fleeing from war '' . 
  how exactly referring to them being impervious to said evidence can be considered arrogant ? 
  from a purely strategic pov what russia is doing makes sense : if they destroy the opposition first there would diminish the risk of the western world to intervene , aka on the side of whom . 
  less risk of seeing a shot-out between us and russia on syrian territory . 
  the free syrian army will be gone , isis only remaining . 
  that would give them a reason to go against isis next and eventually enter in iraq as `` we have to see this through '' . 
  so all of a sudden we have a scenario where russia owns half the middle east . 
  all they have to do is wait for eu to wring their hands and drag their feet some more on the issue and i doubt us would intervene on it 's own . 
  merkel 's been doing that at an expert level already . 
  i am not justifying it , i am explaining why it 's happening . 
  i will ignore any comments which claim otherwise . 
  if you want to debate this opinion , come with ideas , not shit . 
   then again i do n't see why ` we ' should be an authority to lecture them on it either why not ? 
  they crucify teenagers who protest against the government . 
  they stone to death women for `` adultery '' . 
  they stone to death or behead or beat to death gay people . 
  the behead women solely on the testimony of their husbands about alleged crimes . 
  do you want to see how a stoning looks like ? 
  do you want to see how a beheading looks like ? 
  go to liveleak and type : `` woman stoned to death '' or `` woman beheaded '' . 
  not all ideas are created equal . 
  some are just wrong . 
  not just by our western sensibilities , but by decency pure and simple . 
  how can you even consider `` lets kill people for who they are '' and idea worth debating ? 
  if they admitted that the entire `` welcome '' rhetoric would crumble around their heads . 
  do you find the `` welcome '' crowd to be reasonable enough to accept they might have made a mistake ? 
  so you decide to lie instead ? 
  how adorable !, 
   you 're right , your link leads to nowhere . 
  which is why i gave you a print screen of it . 
  it was a private message to a mod that asked me about the sharia encounter first time i mentioned it . 
  i am sure i made up that private message 3 months ago because i knew i would run into some pathetic lier in october and will have to refer back to it . 
  totally , smart one !, 
   the mod who deleted it , prompting you to ask why it was deleted i did n't post them , i just read them and wanted to comment on . 
  they were gone when i went back . 
  as for the sub-tabloid content , they were links to [ washington post ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/a-refugee-riot-puts-a-german-town-on-edge/2015/10/01/fa9075bc-65f5-11e5-bdb6-6861f4521205_story.html ) and [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/refugees-dont-leave-their-conflicts-behind/a-18746390 ) . 
  i am sure in your mind those are tabloids because ... well , because otherwise you 'd have no shit to say . 
  i know that the content goes against your pro-refugee mentality that you apparently constantly reevaluate based on evidence and rationality . 
  if you were to accept those are both evidence and rationality where would take you ? 
  to changing your opinion ? 
  no , much better to dismiss the articles . 
   that 's probably because - again - you 're linking to a comment which does n't exist it was a bunch of questions . 
  i had no idea it was shadow-banned . 
  apparently , in the mind of our pro-refugee mods asking questions is against the rules ... you can see the content here though : http://screencast.com/t/emrhgiove  that 's what you need to prove to everybody here i do n't need to prove anything , least of all to people like you . 
  i am trying to have conversations on topics debated and i express my position or ask questions about it . 
  you may want to try it , you might learn something ... but then again , that might force a perception change about yourself and i doubt your ego can handle it . 
   because having it deleted over and over again clearly is n't cutting it yes , censorship from people so hypocritical it makes me puke will totally convince me !, 
  the very wise mod decided to censor a bunch of questions !, 
   yet you believe onlookers are not only going to believe you can manage to control yourself in society , but are also experts on tens of thousands of others i think this statement gave me cancer ... especially coming from a guy who pinocchios repeatedly . 
  do me a favor : when you type next time , turn your head slightly to the left of right . 
  i live in fear that your nose will spring up from all the lies you 've been spewing and perforate your screen . 
   why would police not have vans in the us ? 
  you 're telling me that if they need to transport 10 police officers they 'll use 5 cars rather than 1 van ? 
  i saw only stuff like this : https://www.google.ro/search?q=police+minivans&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1c1chmo_enro554ro554&amp;es_sm=122&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=995&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=w6top173annuem%253a%253b9fcdvlndtsjlsm%253bhttps%25253a%25252f%25252fcommons.wikimedia.org%25252fwiki%25252ffile%25253adodge_minivan_jacksonville_florida_police_sheriff_in_dc.jpg&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=w6top173annuem%253a%252c9fcdvlndtsjlsm%252c_&amp;usg=__fmfwgmsa46hdapd0_1tofonhgc8%3d&amp;ved=0cckqyjdqfqotckrzrolwpmgcfuidggodh3uerq&amp;ei=io8ovqrjjsi6aofrkage#imgrc=w6top173annuem%3a&amp;usg=__fmfwgmsa46hdapd0_1tofonhgc8%3d i think what they saw there was more like this , hence the confusion : https://www.google.ro/search?q=police+minivans&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1c1chmo_enro554ro554&amp;es_sm=122&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=995&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=w6top173annuem%253a%253b9fcdvlndtsjlsm%253bhttps%25253a%25252f%25252fcommons.wikimedia.org%25252fwiki%25252ffile%25253adodge_minivan_jacksonville_florida_police_sheriff_in_dc.jpg&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=w6top173annuem%253a%252c9fcdvlndtsjlsm%252c_&amp;usg=__fmfwgmsa46hdapd0_1tofonhgc8%3d&amp;ved=0cckqyjdqfqotckrzrolwpmgcfuidggodh3uerq&amp;ei=io8ovqrjjsi6aofrkage#newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=swat+vans, 
  cool , now try one without all the lies ... 
  1 . the joke about the gypsies i mentioned at least one other time that i can remember [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jlzph/refugees_do_not_want_to_go_to_romania_romania_is/cuqj6yt ) , based on the fact that you can only tell the same joke so many times . 
  i 've made several times parallels between the gypsy and the muslim migrants related to the integration or lack of to brain-dead like you who feel everything is pink and unicorns will start roaming the streets . 
  you can find them using this tool '' http://redditcommentsearch.com/ 2 .

  sharia story - [ mentioned 3 months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/3ls1xy ) . 
  just in case the link does n't work , here is the answer i gave to a mod when he asked me details about the story : ( http://prntscr.com/8n16f0 ) . 
  the link to the actual post i can not find as reddit times out when i go that far , but i 'll find a way to fetch it for you . 
  apparently i only made the massive uncontrolled migration statement only once ... except for all the other times , here just a few : [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mtjgz/to_protest_immigration_policies_damaging_european_genetic_and_cultural_heri/cvhygj3?context=3 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mpmnq/germany_fears_far-right_radicalisation_over_refugees/cvgz8gc?context=3 ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l6cin/why_does_reurope_hate_refugees_so_much/cv3jtw8?context=3 ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k9fu1/question_to_europeans_-_what_are_your_real_thoughts_on_the_flood_of_immigra/cuvsvwn?context=3 ) , [ 5 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k4kdz/denmark_sends_refugees_back_to_germany/cuvdvt5?context=3 ) , [ 6 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jgsgx/czech_republic_abandons_ineffective_european/cup5ot0 )  you 've already been caught trying to push sub-tabloid level bullshit into the sub the expression itself it idiotic . 
  caught by whom ? 
  was i trying to sneak it in ? 
  yeah , it 's totally not another lie . 
  just who are you trying to lie to ? 
  about myself ? 
  i 'll doubt you 'll succeed . 
  yourself ? 
  you are so pathetic that you need to lie to yourself ? 
   uwilling to make things up to justify their opinion to others do you mean like you just tied to do with this post ? 
  do n't worry , you do n't look like a hypocrite at all . 
   entrenched yourself in the realm `` unreasonable person and yet i still have n't heard a single reasonable answer to these [ questions here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jgsgx/czech_republic_abandons_ineffective_european/cup5ot0 ) ... you know , from the people like you ( who form and constantly reevaluate their opinions based on credible evidence and rationality ) . 
  because , after all , every single one of my worries so far have proved wrong . 
  it 's your `` do n't worry , things will be fine '' that have proved correct . 
  it 's written for the americans , so it has something they can relate to . 
  i do n't think the police has vans in us, 
  yeah , we should do like the student unions from uk , just ban everything that might be in any way , matter or form offensive to anybody , no matter who they are . 
  this way we will only have maps of various words around europe and what x think of y. . . wait , the last one might be offensive so ... just maps of how europe says hand , 
  this seems kind of pointless research . 
  what can you do , stop being tall ? 
  yes , i insist !, 
  he pays the current workers around 1000 ron which is a little more than 220 euro . 
  the numbers i mentioned are net salary , not gross . 
  so i recount an interaction with a person who believes subject x to be true . 
  i do a disclaimer that i make no claims about the truthfulness subject x. 
  your conclusion from that is that i am saying subject x is totally true . 
  fascinating , do tell me more !, 
  i wonder how fast will this be taken down . 
  [ this one was , no answer as to why ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/a-refugee-riot-puts-a-german-town-on-edge/2015/10/01/fa9075bc-65f5-11e5-bdb6-6861f4521205_story.html ), 
  good !, 
   i 'd call them neutral i find it adorable that you find the pro-refugees neutral while the anti-refugees are fear mongers ... 
   anti-refugee fearmongering used by wannabe politicians to gain popularity the only politician i heard mentioning anything remotely close to this here was a pro-refugees one .
