  or is it that greeks will never vote in germany , therefore there 's no need for solidarity with them ? 
  because they are mandated to do that by eu laws and the dublin agreement . 
  they are not blocking the passage of refugees , they are blocking the passage of illegal migrants ( they are yet to prove they are refugees ) who refuse to register as the eu law requires . 
  if they were to allow them passage , they would not want to stay in hungary , but austria has closed her borders while acting all high-and-mighty and would not allow them passage over their territory to germany . 
  so they would be stuck in hungary , just like they are now stuck in croatia and just as they will be stuck in serbia now that croatia has closed down the borders to unregistered as well . 
  so if the countries refuse to let them in how is this going to work ? 
  forcefully put people on planes ( people who do n't want to go to said country ) and send them to a country that refuses to take them in ? 
  yeah , that 's going to work perfectly . 
  if there is an argument to be had about the handling of the greek crisis , using threats against pretty much half a continent will spell the end of eu in a hurry . 
  i am sure that the influx of a million or so people in the next few years would be exclusively made up of rich muslims therefore it should not be a problem, 
  them being a majority muslim was just an odd coincidence . 
  i did n't say it had a religious motivation , but you can not deny it kind of paints a picture of these guys being prone to riots . 
  something which we are seeing even now . 
  better yet : lets ignore everything ( especially the thousands involved in said riots ) , burry our heads deep in the sand and declare all is well as we can no longer see reality . 
   help them or especially their children become european and leave their old ways behind . 
  because that worked so well so far : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4irqawzvy8 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8864935/prophet-mohammed-in-cartoons-a-history.html http://riotsfrance.ssrc.org/ http://www.clarionproject.org/news/sharia-patrol-german-city-atttempts-enforce-islamic-law these have happened at what ? 
  6 % muslim population ? 
  how do you think it will be at 20 % ? 
  just by taking into account the increase in numbers , do you think it will be less likely or more likely see these again ? 
   based on what ? 
  because you decided this ? 
  no , because that is how they were processed under us laws . 
  as for the original european settleres , til that the pilgrim fathers were refugees under the amazing refugee laws that were so prevalent in 1620 's . 
   but they did refuse to register in closer nations . 
  can i see some sort of historical evidence of that ? 
  or are we still `` lets assume '' - ing ? 
   would you pick a camp or france , or spain , or italy , or croatia or romania or austria or belgium or bulgaria or portugal or poland or the czech republic or slovakia or slovenia or croatia ... because all of these are also soverainly rejected by the people fleeing war . 
  i am sure only germany can provide the exact type of freedom and well-being they so fervently desire and so richly deserve . 
  which is why there is nobody living in the other mentioned countries and which is why nobody from any other european nation ever goes to forge a new life there . 
  but why should we care about factual reality when fiction is so much sexier . 
   refugees are n't legally allowed to work for a certain period of time actually , the period of time is 3 months in germany , 6 months in france , 3 months in italy , 3 months in spain , etc. 
  and yet if you look at statistics , those who are already here took anywhere between 1 and 2 years to get work and be taken off welfare . 
  is it because they do n't find jobs ( so how will the new ones fare better ? ), 
  or is it because they do n't give a shit ? 
   past refugees you are the only one who insists on calling them refugees . 
  i called them migrants because that is what they were . 
  i guess it helps justify your rethoritc , but the fact of the matter is , less than half the current wave are actually refugees . 
  how ever will i survive ... like you ever looked at any of the sources i 've given you in the past ... incidentally , why do you believe the original picture to be correct ? 
  it 's not like it showed you a source either ... 
  because the guardian can be considered informed opinion or factual journalism ? 
  and yet you do n't seem to be upset to the shit they 've been spewing in the past weeks ... 
  it was an extension of your logic ... why should we not expand it to that ? 
  i mean you obviously believe he has the right to break european law and the laws of the countries he passes through for the sake of a better life quality , why should he not have the right to break it for the same reason in other ways too ? 
  i have learned from past interactions these are the only things this particular guy understands, 
  let me follow that reasoning for a bit : the guy has traveled half the distance of asia . 
  are you really going to judge him for wanting a better quality of life and stealing his neighbor 's car ? 
  he is refusing to follow the law of the land he is in . 
  what makes you think he is going to stop at this ? 
  except you are , in the manner so beloved by the guardian , the us and german media , conveniently forgetting a couple of things : * the people you mentioned were not refugees , they were economic migrants , * they did not refuse to follow the law of the lands they passed through to get to the us * they did not refuse registration once they got to the us * they did not have false papers and pretend to be from someplace else . 
  * once there , they started to work , not leach off social security for years to come other than that , spot on, 
  yes , that 's exactly what i am going to do ... i am going to spend the next couple of hours trying to find a video i saw in the past 2 weeks on some site ... or on tv ... just so that some anonymous guy on the internet can believe me ... 
  yeah , yeah , yeah , but can they say shibboleth ? 
  how dare you speak like that about poor refugees who 've made their way to europe . 
  they have the right to do anything they fucking want , they are running from war / s, 
  people assaulting law inforcement , refusing to follow the law of the land they want to enter in , trying to run the border . 
  what would be considered appropriate behavior ? 
  because ive seen the video it is taken from . 
  to follow your logic , so should the native americans do to you ... because after all is the same thing , no ? 
  just as long as they agree with you . 
  no , thats no hypocrisy , not at all ... 
  i love it how every single hypocrite bleeding-heart ignores every single person who is explaining ** why ** they are ** not ok ** with the ** waves of massive uncontrolled migration ** and instead chooses to call everybody racist . 
  yeah , you are one of them . 
  if is part of the mob that is was attacking the police the other day or who have been running away from registration as the law requires ... yeah , he actually is ... 
  ... and the only place in europe where neither the taliban nor the army is killing you is ... you guessed it , germany !, 
   hence he could n't be deported . 
  tough luck !, 
  like i said , i am sick and tired of giving rights to those who want to take away those rights in the first place . 
  so reacting to people throwing rocks and attacking the police is xenophobic and anti-muslim ... nice to know that . 
  would be an appropriate reaction ? 
  lie down and take it ? 
   had already been convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison in 2008 for membership in a terrorist organization and this is the gist of things . 
  if they are just residents , you should not convict them and then let them loose , you should put them on the first flight to whatever hellhole they crawled out of . 
  if they are new citizens , you should strip them of their citizenship and then put them on the first flight to whatever hellhole they crawled out of . 
  i think we should stop giving rights to terrorists as they do n't obviously adhere to the same legal system as the rest . 
  so why should they get rights under that ? 
  no , he was saying something about immigration in general a few days back that made a surprising amount of sense . 
  the guy is still an asshole ... 
  and yet the us media has been scolding hungary for days now ... 
  shower thought : i lived to see the day when wilders , farage and orban made sense ... please , make it stop !, 
  explanation : very few of them actually flee war . 
  there 's an article from the bbc 's chief of defense section . 
  read that and you will understand what i mean . 
  as a matter of fact , i held a fake syrian passport in my hand last weekend , from one of my grandma 's gypsy neighbours, 
  no , what i meant was what would happen if something like the hungary border would happen , thousands of people at a time trying to run the border and assaulting cops . 
  i 'd rather be shoot than not go to germany ... ftfy, 
  well , as it turns out , neither do the `` refugees '' http://www.thelocal.se/20150101/refugees-protest-rural-sweden-re-location, 
  so how long will it be until the retardian starts campaigning for funds to rent a plane and bring them all right into the middle of europe ? 
   any sensible person with a bit of decency i doubt anybody has ever accused ponta of being any of those . . 
  meanwhile google only wants to help the migrants who safely in europe , country-shopping . 
  one wonders how would the us border patrols react to a mass of mexicans trying to force the southern border ... would they let them in and offer coffee , tea and delicious sandwiches ? 
  should we offer better or at least similar services ? 
  should we offer better or similar speeds ? 
  should we be less crappy on mobiles ? 
  nooo , lets bitch about the other guys being unfairly dominant . 
  that will surely bring us more visitors ... 
  i think we can do without the diversity that says women are just half-a-person and gays should be killed . 
  also , diversity worked so well ... nowhere, 
  which is hilarious seeing how we are a country with 60 % water border . 
  so they need to be in the middle of things ? 
  they can not be kept to the side or far in the back of the hostilities field for their own protection ?
