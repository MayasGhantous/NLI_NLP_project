  romania was hit every other week with the bill for the processing and returning them to our country . 
  you will effectively be punished for being poor , while having no way to keep the people alloted inside . 
   you will have some minimal standards of assistance 1 . 
  is the assumption that they will mouch of that assistance for the rest of their lives ? 
  how do you solve a problem like the wage gap between east and west ? 
   they get food , they get clothing and a roof over their head . 
  but nothing more again , back to my original question : how do you make them stay put ? 
  how do you make them , once they arrive in the country they were allocated to , not hit the road as soon as the door of the bus opens ? 
   as long as it does n't happen en masse there is no huge problem that 's a very big if . 
  there are a few hundreds doing it here , imagine a few thousands . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyqlpabqrsy  nothing the rich states cant handle anyway so why not take them all in the first place ? 
   what you see , though , once you treat these people well , they dont want to run . 
  the reason you see people run away now is because they 're put in terrible conditions or are treated dishonestly by saying one thing and doing another . 
  you are wrong . 
  look at the links i gave you . 
  the one from sweden and the one from france . 
  think about it like this : once your finish the asylum processes , you are left in a country where the average income will not allow you to live , as it happens in romania and bulgaria . 
  or in which you will live poorly like greece and most of other eastern european countries . 
  what should these countries do ? 
  force the local businesses to hire migrants at germany level salaries ? 
   can we discuss this without cynisim can we discuss this without wishful thinking ? 
  just based on facts ? 
  look at [ this link ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/15/refugee-crisis-hungary-launches-border-crackdown-live-updates ) . 
  they are being stoped at the border of hungary because they need to be registered , which they flatly refuse . 
  so they escape , they take over trains , they refuse to dismount from trains , etc. 
  it 's not because the camps are made of tents , it 's because they want to get to germany . 
   best thing would be is an euriopean wide refugee institution with people from all member states who take care of the refugees or assist local governments . 
  it took 5 years for frontex to be established and built . 
  considering the eu bureaucracy , how long do you think this will take ? 
  the crysis is now , not in 10 years . 
   please be sensible enough to know the eu can handle this the biggest question is the one i asked . 
  i have not yet heard of a single official eu position ( i heard rumours ) or a valid solution . 
  every single solution works on the assumption that the refugees will be happy no matter where they are sent if you give them enough money for the first year or so . 
  which is an assumption already copiously contradicted by reality . 
   significant numbers of refugees burning off their fingerprints to cheat the system there are a lot of reports that point that way , including from their own statements . 
  it 's not new , it started back in 2004 , except then only 5 % of the finger-prints were illegible in sweden . 
  [ from here ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3593895.stm ) . 
  from this migrant wave , practically the interviews with migrants from this wave i 've seen they all refer to fingerprint burning . 
   eu-wide fingerprint database it 's called eurodac and it worked before this new trend of burning off prints . 
  we can expect this trend to rise as the mandatory relocation happens , not to go down . 
  eurodac is linux based :d, 
   we deport illegal citizens constantly in the balkans . 
  syria is a war zone , it is illegal to deport anybody there . 
  it is also illegal to deport somebody in any other place outside europe ( aka : the country where they first landed in ) which is not their country . 
  these people have no papers !, 
  you do n't know where they are from . 
  it takes months to determine that . 
  we are not talking about the 1000 you got last year , we are talking about the 100,000 , 500,000 this year . 
   giving them a place where they can actually live well is a far better deterrent to leave . 
  [ do you mean a place like a sweden ? ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150911/refugees-threaten-to-jump-off-swedish-ferry ) . 
  [ or france ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29074736 ) yes , i am sure we can magically turn bulgaria , romania , greece into that ... fuck , we can do it tonight . 
  all we have to do is go outside , locate a shooting star and wish for it really hard . 
   why do you keep talking about these people as prisoners or criminals the only place where that happens is inside your head . 
  do you understand at all how this forced distribution would work ? 
  let me tell you : they plan to take the people from one place ( italy , hungary or greece ) and they move them someplace where they do n't want to go because it 's poor . 
  how do you think that moving process is going to go ? 
  what do you think will happen once they get to said destination ? 
  what happens if they do n't want to be registered there ? 
  what happens if they run away ( as they 've been doing so far ) . 
  serious question , do try to answer them . 
   it is not easy to live illegally it 's very easy to live illegally . 
  significantly easier than it is in the east . 
  which is why so many people have done it in the past or are doing currently . 
  not to mention the grace period until they are identified , if you can , in fact , identify them . 
   so instead of being criminals on the run , these are people who will , one way or another , come in contact with authorities this is what you are hoping will happen . 
  history has proven this to be false already . 
  look at the gypsy population . 
   you will always have people who stay hidden , but many will be found eventually . 
  which will not stop them from trying over and over and over again . 
  essentially the only way they can consistently be caught is by making border checks permanent and thus de-facto ending the schengen agreement . 
  so what happened next ? 
  they were returned to serbia ? 
  treasure hunt idea : lets go look at older economist articles and find those that has this idea in : `` us should welcome more refugees and economic migrants '' ... or canada ... or australia ... 
   their identity is processed and share this info with other eu countries our current system registers only fingerprints . 
  [ this ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3593895.stm ) makes them very difficult to register them in the first place , then to identify them if they leave and send them back where they registered . 
   when they do run , they can be found and sent back look at all the success has europol had tracking criminals across borders . 
  they catch 1 in 12 , but yeah , totally  why you think of it as a prison is beyond me before they are registered , can they walk out of it ? 
  what happens if they refuse to be registered ? 
   poland , they can not leave and apply for asylum in germany yes , i am sure you are going to convince them by showing the written word . 
  1 . they refuse to be processed in the country they are allocated in . 
  what do you do ? 
  deport them to a war zone ? 
  that 's illegal 2 . most have burned away their fingerprints . 
  we do n't have a multi-point identification system for asylum registration . 
  this means they are processed , they can throw away the papers and leave and either re-apply and we would be none the wiser or stay in germany illegally . 
  they can still work because there is shit-load of illegal work to go around . 
  once they are processed they are free to go out . 
  are you going to lock them up ? 
  tie them to trees to they do n't leave ? 
  how well did that work in hungary  they would have to apply in countries they do n't get to choose where they apply , they are being forcefully re-distributed . 
   there are rules in place for that they do n't work . 
  maybe you like the dark and damp feeling , but do take your head of your ass for a little bit and take a little look around . 
  we are already applying some of those rules and they are not working !, 
  do you think they will miraculously start working in the future ? 
  sorry , i was actually answering to another comment . 
   what exactly does salary have to do with it ? 
  that question is awesome in it 's stupidity . 
  they ** do n't want ** to be registered in the ** poor countries ** because after the state help expires , ** they will work for significantly less money ** insuring that the asylum financial help is limited for a period of time . 
  after that , they got to work , unless you assume they just want to stay home and give said benefits forever .
