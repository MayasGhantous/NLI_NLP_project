   they are not allowed to travel/work in country y which is why illegal work does n't exist anywhere in europe ...  until their application is granted step 1 : get registered in bulgaria , step 2 : throw away papers and make my way to germany , step 3 : profit !, 
  it 's not really that hard to imagine ( well , maybe for you it 's down right impossible ), 
  well , at least we beat albania ... 
  oh and speaking of listening , the comment was ** from a german or eu official ** , said description does not include some journalist someplace . 
  also , [ i 'll leave this here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) so you can walk me through the amazing plan for having the same salaries between eastern europe and germany . 
  or are we working under the assumption that they will be louts living on welfare for the rest of their natural lives ? 
  i already explained why that will not work . 
  do try and use the part of your brain that is n't full of mush . 
  because we remember how it was with the gypsy . 
  every other week we got hit with the bill from germany , france , spain , uk , etc. 
  for the capture , hosting , processing and transportation of the illegal gypsy migrants caught in their territory . 
  so no , we are not winning anything . 
  well , the idea of being sent to a center did n't work in hungary . 
  check out the riots there . 
  are you going to basically lock them up for years ? 
  at some point you have to let them out . 
  plus , they run the fence of the center . 
  what do you do ? 
  shoot them ? 
  beat them up ? 
  allocate military squads to guard the centers ? 
  centers work some for 100-200 people , not for thousands . 
   because of dracula you might be onto something there . 
  after all , dracula can be defeated with holy water and crosses ... which most migrants being muslim can not touch as it 's haram ... so ... they 're basically sitting ducks to the local vampire population, 
  question : were they released after or deported ? 
  as long as they get to germany i do n't think they give a shit . 
  plus , all these assume the registration is voluntary . 
  look what happens in hungary to get an idea about how they react to registration ... 
  well , that 's what happens when you want to be the leader of europe . 
  tada , comes with responsibilities not only rights , 
  found it ( i was a bit off ) : http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/extern/exodul/sondaj+cati+romani+sunt+de+acord+cu+primirea+refugiatilor+in+rom the first question is `` i agree that romania receives a number of migrants '' and agreement is 65 % , the second question is `` i agree that part of those migants to relocate in my city '' and it has 46 % pro and 50 % against . 
  there was one done in romania . 
  i ca n't find it now , but there was a really funny part : at the question `` do you agree for romania to take in refugees '' the majority were ok ( 52 % or something ) , but at the question `` would you agree for refugees to be relocated to your city '' the approval rate went to like 40 % . 
  the center that does the filtering is in india, 
  only if you ask for money, 
  story time : here you are , 2000 people about to be returned to a country which is no longer at war , but still pretty fucked up . 
  add about another 2000 family members . 
  add some leftist bleeding hearts who feel for the poor migrants . 
  how do you think that 's going to end ? 
  here 's a fast idea : we are not going to oppose in the ec or the parliament or try to punish denmark in any way when you only issue temporary permits instead of permanent residency . 
  here 's another : we are not going to start guilt-tripping you or punish denmark in the future for returning the refugees to their own country after this is over . 
  til that one small ngo = all danes, 
  welcome to europistan, 
  are you referring to evictions ? 
  ok , let me try again to explain this to you with words like to an adult : * eurodac relies on ** fingerprints only ** . 
  lots of migrants are ** burning off * their fingerprints . 
  hence , eurodac 's usefulness is limited . 
  * the above means we need a system which has a multi-point identification ( i mentioned a few options ) . 
  that system is what i was referring to . 
  you mentioned that system already exists . 
  i asked for a source as to that system 's existence . 
  * you came and said something stupid ( twice , one because it does n't apply and second for miss-identifying it while strutting like a peacock ) . 
  i explained how that is stupid . 
  and here we are ... did you understand all that ? 
  if not , it 's ok , i can run out and buy some crayons and try to eli5 with pretty pictures . 
  eurodac relies on fingerprinting which they are burning off !, 
  oh , and btw , oh , great knower of things , it was established for dubin ii , not iii . 
  what i was referring to was multi-point identification system ( incl dna sampling for instance ) which does n't exist . 
  but yes , run along now , i get that your arguments are pretty much exhausted ... 
  romania and bulgaria are not in their path . 
  in fact , the idea of romania seems to terrify the migrants . 
  serbia is not in eu so the uk and german media does n't care about them . 
  there 's this ad about the microsoft cloud and how the dna sequencing took a long time and now thanks to the microsoft cloud it does n't . 
  dna sequencing is one thing , dna comparison is another . 
  the point is this : the whole process of hunting down , registering , re-registering , identifying , returning will end up costing more than just taking them all in the first place ... 
  hunt them down how ? 
  ok , you catch them , then what ? 
   to where they were assigned to stay . 
  how do you know where they were assigned to stay ? 
  they carry no id , burned fingerprints , face recognition unreliable , dna profiling takes months . 
  how is going to pay for processing once they are caught and for the return flight ? 
  source ? 
  where ? 
  meanwhile they bitch about hungary and a bloody fence ... 
  yet , the calls to jihad and `` we do n't want freedom we want sharia '' are just fine and acceptable ... 
  i 'm expecting it 's a different situation . 
  most of those foreigners who touch benefits come for low-skill jobs . 
  those are usually in abundance ( such as au-pair , garbage collector , construction worker ) . 
  i doubt you went for those . 
  the other workers coming there come for highly specialized skills such as doctors or engineers and those can easily find a job there or in other countries . 
  fingerprints - burned off . 
  face recognition is unreliable . 
  dna takes a few months . 
  eye-scan takes a few months to process and return results . 
  meanwhile , as they are being processed , what happens to them ? 
  keep them in cryo-freeze so they do n't eat and drink ? 
  also , answer my other questions ... plus , it will take a few years to build something like that and populate it . 
  this is not happening 2 years from now ... 
   eu wide registration system fingerprints - burned off .

  face recognition is unreliable . 
  dna takes a few months . 
  eye-scan takes a few months to process and return results . 
  plus , it will take a few years to build something like that and populate it . 
  plus the cost of operation . 
  plus the cost of training . 
  you should see the vilas they have and the cars ... 
  stop watching ncis , will ya ... it takes about 2 years to build a database like that . 
  it takes several months for the identification to come through . 
  it 's easy to cheat simply by adding / removing your beard or by not keeping your face straight in the picture .
