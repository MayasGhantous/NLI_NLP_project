  sure , it 's all good while you 're in an economic boom , but you get fucking killed by a crisis . 
  simply put , it 's unsustainable . 
  until you realize the massive wage hikes come from inflating our public debt and deficit balance . 
  it 's all good until you go the way of greece because you have a bloated public sector and an economy that doesnt produce enough to sustain it but rather keeps going based on borrowing . 
  policies like this are always one financial crisis away from ending in disaster . 
  this is why many in romania would rather see more investments in our future while wages should be increased at the rate the economy is growing instead of borrowing money in order to do it . 
  does that seem wrong to you ? 
  you wont have a problem in big cities or popular tourist destinations such as sighisoara . 
  most young people can speak english just fine , with middle aged people it 's hit and miss and with old people you 'd better hope they have a nephew nearby . 
  sighisoara gets a lot of foreign tourists so they are used to it . 
  there are a few nice hotels up in the citadel in medieval buldings , it 's pretty cool . 
  pretty chill . 
  unless we 're talking about traffic , our infrastructure kind of sucks because of a lack of motorways . 
  what a retard . 
  you must be confusing the eu with russia again , since they are the ones employing a massive troll army . 
  lol @ people defending berlusconi because he 's a right wing populist clown just like their favorite politicians . 
  the guy was corrupt to the bone like you pointed out , he changed laws in italy in order to absolve him personally of the crimes he comitted . 
  the italian economy is also in the state it is today due to his actions or rather lack of any action .

  can you stop conflating immigration with colonization ? 
  hungarians came and conquered the natives , with swords and shit . 
  they didnt move to europe for a better life over the course of hundreds of years until they magically took over . 
   it really baffles me why so many `` tolerant '' left wing people side with immigrants over these kind of issues . 
  it 's not about taking side . 
  it 's not about agreeing with them on those issues . 
  in europe many of those same things used to be the norm , change happened because most people started to want those things , however many native europeans are still sexist and homophobic . 
  the idea is that adding another item on the list of - ism 's wo n't make things better in our society , but worse . 
  if tolerance is the goal , then being a racist twat towards immigrants can only take us further away from that . 
  that does n't mean you 're `` taking their side '' or `` agreeing with them '' , it just means that some people recognize the simple fact that adding racism in the mix is only going to make things worse , instead of better . 
  it 's highly ironic when people that equate muslims to terrorists or scum hide behind protecting the values of europe to justify it . 
   many countries in this union joined the eu even though the people voted against . 
  multiple times in some cases . 
  democracy my arse . 
  some nations did n't even get to vote on the matter . 
  who voted against joining the eu and yet still joined ? 
  i see this myth repeated so often it 's mind-boggling . 
  so because people voted no the first time for some treaties , before changes were made , and then votes yes , it means it is n't democratic ? 
  you do realize you can just check support for the eu and see that it is indeed positive right ? 
  you keep giving the example of eastern european nations but fail to acknowledge they are overwhelmingly pro-eu . 
   and this shit wo n't change if people just decide to leave instead of trying to force the change in the nation . 
  that 's the fucking problem . 
  same shit as mexico just on a less dramatic scale . 
  that shit has changed , unemployment is good in most of of eastern europe and wages have risen a lot in the past decade , even doubling in size . 
   short term benefit , meanwhile the population dropped dramatically , watch as some of these nations will start to crumble once they figure out that they do n't have enough people to support it . 
  more unsubstantiated claims . 
  you do realize people left because the countries were dirt poor right ? 
  well , they are n't so dirt poor anymore and the economy is fast improving . 
  people will stop leaving en masse after a certain point of development and some will even return . 
  keeping them all in misery and unemployment because of some crackpot theory that it 's a superior way of developing the country is retarded . 
   same shit as mexico just on a less dramatic scale . 
  same what ? 
  the problem in mexico is n't that people are leaving , it 's that they have massive corruption problems . 
  yet , the economy of mexico is indeed improving as well . 
  it 's not anti-nationalist , but it proposes a new paradigm where people put less accent on nationalism . 
   the only difference being that its capitalist-socialist instead of full on communist . 
  but the idea and plan are the same . 
  oh and you know ... the fact that the ussr forcefully occupied eastern europe and installed brutal dictatorships , while the same countries joined the eu willingly and democratically , the population of those countries being very pro-eu , but i guess that difference is irrelevant to you . 
   instead of staying their nations and fixing them , people just leave to work in other nations some people leave , some also come back , and they send a lot of money back home . 
  often the choice for these people is either unemployment or working in western europe , yet you seem to prefer they stay in their country and be unemployed or work for so little they ca n't support their families . 
  pretty much all of the eastern european countries that have joined the eu have developed tremendously since joining the eu and the wages have n't gone down , they have gone up significantly . 
   and the people who leave will at some point lose their culture through the generations because they do not come back . 
  so fucking what ? 
  people can choose how to live their lives , you seem to want to force them to keep their culture . 
  the ones that leave do it because it 's better for them and their families and you want to keep them from doing it because you think it will somehow make eastern europe prosperous outside the eu . 
  it 's totally unsubstantiated bs , and i doubt ee would fair better had it stayed out of the eu . 
  your argument is laughable . 
  you literally chose the two most pro-eu nations in eastern europe . 
  the vast majority of the people consider the eu a good thing in both countries . 
   since when ? 
  since they 're fighting an active war there ? 
   we are though . 
  we are less valuable so you 're banking on being less valuable while ignoring all of the history of the last 100 years ? 
   why do you think so many nations in eastern europe do n't like eu ? 
  lol . 
  which nations are those ? 
  romania , hungary and poland are among the most pro-eu countries in the union . 
  just look at the approval of the population instead of taking after what orban says . 
  same with the baltic states . 
  currency based measurements can be adjusted for inflation . 
  the only thing that is really subjective is the concept of value itself , because it is defined by human perception . 
  the point was that economics is not a zero sum game , not even close . 
  considering germany has a population of 80 million , it 's not surprising . 
  like others have pointed out , germany 's trade balance within the eu is well ... balanced . 
  i was really surprised when i found out there 's 18 million of you in such a small country . 
  your population is comparable to ours despite romania being the 7 ` th largest country in europe by size and much much bigger than the netherlands . 
   you say that economics is not a closed system . 
  yet a transaction always has one party on the receiving end and one party on the other . 
  that in itself is closed . 
  yes but it 's not like human civilization has started for example with 1000 units of value which we have kept trading around . 
  value is created by humans every time someone makes something new , every time a seed is planted , every time we discover new resource reserves and so on . 
  trade and banking do n't create value in themselves , they redistribute resources more efficiently , which does allow people to create more value , like if for example someone wants to create a new machinery which brings a lot of new value into the world but he is lacking a resource which someone else has , then it 's fair to say that trading between the two parties will create value indirectly because the guy building a machine can finally complete it and the other party gets machinery that increases productivity for further value gains . 
  it 's the same with banking , some people have ideas and want to make investments that create value but they lack capital , while others have money they 're not using , so the latter put their money in banks which then gets redistributed towards the people that need it in order to create something , thus banking helps create value through redistributing unused capital . 
  obviously the earth 's and the sun 's resources are finite , but we 're nowhere near exploiting them at full capacity , not even close , we 're using maybe 0.000000000001 % of the sun 's energy or something crazy like that . 
  like what ? 
  what are these grave punishments that stop countries from leaving ? 
  maybe other countries dont actually want to leave ? 
  maybe . 
  you seem to have a persecution complex . 
  if by punished you mean not being given a hug and a kiss for leaving the way the uk did , then sure , i agree .
