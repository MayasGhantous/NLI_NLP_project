  this argument is ridiculous . 
  the population of most countries in europe has gone down , it 's the effect of negative birth rate and it has nothing to do with the eu , it 's a natural consequence of a higher standard of living , in fact . 
  the population of romania has also shrunk a lot , even before we became part of the eu . 
  it 's a silly argument . 
  economically , politically , socially , we all advanced a lot thanks to the european union , i can say this with absolute certainty when it comes to romania as well . 
  since they voted for it , which was more than a month ago . 
  until the economic crises hit all countries benefited from the eu . 
  people should n't be so shocked when things like this get sold for like 1 $ . 
  that 's what happens when you have some shitty factory or airport that produces more losses than income . 
  that 's kinda the point the quantitative easing program , to get the inflation to 2 % . 
  whether it will succeed or not remains to be seen . 
  that 's kind of the problem is n't it ? 
  greece was n't trusted because they got themselves in this situation by lying about their economy and excessive borrowing , both of those things break the trust of lenders . 
  not that hard to understand . 
  they voted for it because they 're just as much a bunch of populist suck-ups that are trying to milk some more percentages for their next election . 
  voting against tax cuts would 've been seen in a very negative light . 
  also , to be fair , contexts have changed since then , with the problems greece and china faces it only becomes riskier for us to cut taxes by this much . 
  yeah , this actually seems to be the problem in most countries these days , people have nobody to really believe in because they 're all a bunch of incompetent and stealing assholes . 
  syriza has n't done you much good but i guess they are actually the only ones that might care about the greek people . 
  yeah , it 's not like there are n't documented cases of exactly that happening when countries default on their loans . 
  to make things even worse greece has to change their currency in the process which inevitably would lead to inflation even if you do n't default on your loans . 
  our fish tail goes right into the black sea . 
  i did n't give an in-depth analysis , i know that hitler targeted more than just the jews and i know that stalin had the consolidation of power in mind , but stalin and his regime in general gave no fucks about people starving or their solider 's murdering and raping people , it was n't all calculated , a lot of deaths were simply due to the fact that stalin could , or because of fucked up reasoning like when he told the leaders of the countries that complained about soviet soliders raping the native women that it is their right to have some fun and he wo n't deny them that . 
  stalin was a sociopath , more so than hitler , but hitler had a burning passion for eradicating those he considered inferior so there 's that . 
  stalin was just very cold and calculating and had no qualms about sacrificing millions for his own ends , even if it was russians . 
  this is the difference between them . 
  they were both mass-murdering megalomaniacs , but hitler 's mass-murdering was directed towards certain people while stalin had no problem murdering anyone . 
  i really do n't care to argue which is worse , most people consider what hitler did as worse , i consider what stalin and his regime did as at least comparable in graveness . 
  just because you murder tens of millions to consolidate your reign and not because you hate those people does n't really make it better , it 's just a more calculated and a colder line of reasoning . 
  the only real differences between the soviets and the nazis were that stalin killed indiscriminately while hitler focused on the jews and gypsies . 
  the soviet union was definitely not better when it came to human rights and abuses , it just fucked over everyone instead of just certain groups . 
  except that what they 're really celebrating is the soviet occupation of east european states that only brought us misery and a lot of traumas that we still have to deal with . 
  if you 're from belgium you have no idea what it was like for the former eastern bloc , so i do n't see why you 're defending the forceful occupation of half of europe so much . 
  worked in romania too . 
  yeah , turns out , when you borrow a bunch of money , you have to pay it back . 
  it 's so silly to say they have a budget surplus when you discount the loans you have to pay back , because that means you do n't really have a surplus . 
  if you borrow money from a bank you would n't say you have a budget surplus if your salary is n't enough to pay back the monthly rate now would you ? 
  maybe i 'm making a retarded argument here but paying back your loans is kind of important and counts towards the budget . 
  pretty sure most people in europe look up to germany and most of us like you . 
  do n't be so dramatic , sure , there are a lot of idiots , but i 'm willing to bet most people do n't even call you nazis because they do n't like you , they do it because they think they 're edgy and are teenagers . 
  they will , but that does n't mean they wo n't get new loans in the meantime . 
  the point for countries is n't to have zero debt , what really matters is for them to be able to pay those loans back as they are due and for other countries to trust that they can . 
  the problem that greece has is not being able to pay back the loans on a year to year basis , not that it ca n't achieve zero debt , that is n't really the point . 
  you ca n't really say that about cities like sibiu , a very charming medieval town . 
  tax evasion can easily count for the loss in collection of 5-10 % of the gdp , which seems to be the case in greece . 
  that is in fact very significant , as even collecting 5 % more of the gdp in taxes would be enough to cover greece 's deficit . 
  hyperinflation is a real thing you know , it 's not made up , and it wo n't be avoided just because you think there 's some conspiracy to keep greece a ward . 
  in the current situation you 're an idiot if you think hyperinflation wo n't happen . 
  greeks think the situation is bad now , but people forget what a truly collapsed economy leads to . 
  hunger , riots , lack of medicine , money that is worth nothing a week after you get payed ( if you 're lucky to have a job ) and so on . 
  meanwhile the greeks and syriza have no responsibility whatsoever in this issue . 
  this is laughably hilarious . 
  you are fucking delusional . 
  you 're delusional if you think billions of people would just emigrate to the eu for a slight chance of a better life . 
  this has n't happened until now and it will never happen , people usually move when things get really really bad , most do n't actually seek to leave their homes just because things might be rosier in europe . 
  i do n't know how the hell you get ideas like this , you seem completely disconnected with reality if you really think like that . 
  these people that ran to europe did so because their country is in absolute shambles , not because they want to mooch off you . 
  what would you rather happen then ? 
  send them back so they can die or live in miserable poverty ? 
  i 'm just asking what your great solution is , because these laws are in place in the spirit of trying to help our fellow human beings escape countries that are incompatible with life , not `` culturally incompatible '' . 
  there 's probably a significant part of environmental science that benefited from space related exploration and technologies . 
  the creditors need to know that they will get their money back , it 's just the way it works , nobody lends money out of the kindness of their hearts and not expect it to be payed back . 
  the measures are there to make sure greece can have a sustainable economy , with everything that implies ( paying back debts ) . 
  these reforms are n't nearly as bad as people make them out to be , romania had to raise their vat to 24 % when austerity hit , now we 're lowering it back to 19 % , but that 's because we implemented them when we had to and now we can get back to lowering the tax burden and boost our economic growth . 
  greece was unwilling to accept the fact that their economy was unsustainable and that they needed to take drastic measures to rebalance their economy and because of that they need even more drastic measures now . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth basically , the reforms worked in terms of getting greece out of recession and managed to create a budget surplus , it only now that syriza came to power that they are back in recession . 
  syriza also managed to be incompetent enough to get a much worse deal for greece than the one they could 've gotten months ago while also putting greece back into a recession . 
  that 's just the state of things , those are numbers . 
  in short , if reforms would 've been implemented when they should have and fully like it was asked of them , greece would already probably be back to economic growth by now , this way they and syriza managed to make sure they will suffer for way longer than it would 've been necessary . 
  greece had a way higher deficit than they should 've had , hence the cooking of the books . 
  when your deficit is so high it is clear that what you 're doing is unsustainable , especially in the context of greece corruption , incompetence , tax evasion and such . 
  there 's a reason why greece is the situation they are today , and it 's not because of big bad europe , believe what you want , but most of it is still their fault and their responsibility . 
  they created a huge bubble for themselves and then when it went crashing down it dragged their economy into financial collapse , hence why they needed the huge loans . 
  found the guy that watches too much antena3 . 
  just for your information , the first stage of criminal proceedings is to start investigating the crime ( not the culprit ) , only after there is and i quote `` din datele ** si ** probele existente in cauza rezulta indicii rezonabile ca o anumita persoana a savarsit fapta pentru care s-a inceput urmarirea penala , procurorul dispune ca urmarirea penala sa se efectueze in continuare fata de acesta '' ( translates to a need of information and evidence to make a criminal charge towards someone ) . 
  simply put , you can go to the dna and declare that some politician asked you for a bribe all day long , he 'll never actually have a charge brought against him until there 's other evidence to support your claim . 
  most people in romania are not very sympathetic towards the greeks as we believe that it is first and foremost their fault for being in this situation , they borrowed way too much and lived at unsustainable levels , they lied about their deficit and have a lot of problems with corruption and tax evasion . 
  the economic crisis was just the thing that pushed them over the edge and exposed all the things that are wrong with their economy . 
  we had to implement austerity measures in romania too , but now our economy has rebalanced and we 're showing strong growth , so this only makes our perception of the problem even more unfavorable towards the greeks . 
  in short , most people do n't really associate the problem of the greeks with the eurozone , they associate it with their fuck-ups , which is why most romanians are still for joining the euro at some point . 
  the only thing we do n't agree on is when that should happen , i think a lot of us want to be cautious and only join when our economy is more on par with that of the eu average . 
  that 's retarded , we have the assumption of innocence until proven guilty just like every other country . 
  nobody was convicted without evidence , that 's just propaganda used by those who would justify their corruption by having us believe that they 're targeted politically and not because they stole millions from us . 
  sad part is how a lot of people actually believe those that stole from them and made the country a dysfunctional shithole . 
  oh , you mean except the fact that romanians are a product of the ** romans ** and the dacians that lived on our territory ? 
  the problem with that beautiful theory of yours that they should invest and not cut spending is that nobody is going to lend you any money when you 're running a huge deficit without you giving guarantees that you 're going to reduce that deficit . 
  investing may be the best way to get out of an economic crisis but the problem is that creditors need assurance that you 're going to rebalance your economy , not just spend even more money and create an even bigger deficit on the hopes that years later it will have a better impact than cutting down on things . 
  another big problem with your theory is that you think governments are actually competent and able to invest that money wisely to create growth and `` out-speed '' the deficit , but the truth is that in most of these countries there are good reasons why the situation is what it is , and it has to do with incompetence and corruption . 
  also , a lot of countries have gone through austerity and they managed to come out of the recession and have economic growth , so you ca n't say it does n't work , it does work , it sucks for a few years but done right it balances the economy and gives a stable base for future growth . 
  there was a lot of international backlash towards romania before we joined the ue for not integrating them and discriminating against them . 
  now that a lot of them moved to western europe you 're facing the same problem of not being able to integrate them so a lot of romanians like to gloat about how `` we told you so '' . 
  it 's sad really . 
  pretty much every country managed to bounce back from the crisis more or less except for greece , you ca n't just blame it all on the eu . 
  in simple terms greece borrowed a lot of money to keep living at a standard it should n't have been living at , your economy just could n't and ca n't support it and that 's why you needed to borrow all this money , it really boils down to this . 
  if greece defaults and goes back to the drachma i doubt people will `` flock to it '' , they definitely wo n't for at least a while until things stabilize . 
  you do n't really wan na go to a country with hyperinflation and shortages of all kinds , which is likely to happen . 
  lots of countries imposed austerity measures on their citizens and now they 're back on track , macroeconomics is n't that simple , you ca n't just say that austerity is bad when you have a deficit of 10 % of your gdp , how the hell are you going to recover from not having money to pay salaries to your own citizens ? 
  nobody is going to be willing to keep lending you money when your deficit runs amok . 
  that 's why austerity was imposed , so that the economy can balance itself back to sustainable levels . 
  us in romania had austerity measures imposed on us too , salaries cut by 25 % and such .
