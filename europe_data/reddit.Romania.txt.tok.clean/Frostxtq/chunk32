  obviously there 's some cultural differences between na and europe that makes this a non-issue here as we 've had social healthcare for decades and do n't want to change that , but that does n't mean he 's analogous of a democrat in na . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  he 'd fit right into the republican party . 
  i do n't know what makes you say that . 
  that is not however what the far right and far left is . 
  they are pretty well defined ideologies . 
  you can easily pin hofer to the far right . 
  no , many muslims have been born in europe and thus they are not `` foreigners '' , it 's only you racists that think everyone is divided neatly by ethnicity or race or religion and that everyone should just just stay `` with their own '' wherever you think that is . 
  incredible the amount of stupidity that is coming out of right wing nationalists telling people where they belong or not . 
  you have less in common with european values than many of the people you say do n't belong here . 
  just because it 's easy to understand it does n't mean it 's not stupid and wrong . 
  do you even know what discrimination is ? 
  it 's not judging someone for their individual actions , it 's judging someone for the actions of some other person or minority that is part of the same group as that person . 
  it gets a bit retarded and unfair when we 're talking about one of the world 's major religions with more than 1b people . 
  i 'm so glad that orban represents eastern europe now . 
  / s romania does not share these views . 
  you know who wants fewer eu powers ? 
  nationalist-populist leaders , not east anything . 
  the majority of people in eastern europe are pro-federalization . 
  sauce : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf page 154 `` the eu should develop further into a federation of nation-states '' hungary - ** 65 % ** yes , 29 % no poland - ** 59 % ** yes , 16 % no romania - ** 53 % ** yes , 24 % no croatia - ** 50 % ** yes , 32 % no slovenia - ** 44 % yes ** , 37 % no slovakia - 41 % yes , ** 43 % ** no so pretty much only slovakia . 
  yeah . 
  not to mention romania and poland make up the bulk of eastern europeans both by population and size , and they 're both very pro-federalization . 
  because you 're making a generalization about an entire nation based on what exactly ? 
  a few random comments that you 've noticed because you take them as some personal attack ? 
  no , you 're just being hot headed and ignorant . 
  it 's a legit question with an interesting discussion to be had . 
  geez , it 's a discussion . 
  why do you take it so personally ? 
  also , generalization much ? 
  i 'm sorry but banning some random piece of religious attire in a discriminatory fashion is against religious freedom and basic human rights , i do n't see how anyone could make the argument that it 's a progressive change . 
  i can understand banning niqab 's because they cover one 's face , but anything else is just bullshit peddled by populists to angry frustrated white people taking it out on the wrong people . 
  this law does not hurt isis or terrorists one bit , it only serves to hurt law abiding muslims that want to follow their religion peacefully . 
  isis gives no shits , they 'll just use it as propaganda for their recruiting `` look at the evil west oppressing your religion '' . 
  trump is crashing and burning . 
  things are n't so bad . 
  at least all the racism and all the bullshit is coming up to the surface , that 's good in the medium to long term . 
  brexit is n't so bad in the long term either , people just do n't see it now . 
  the uk was a very big anti-federalization force and their tabloid media was one of the biggest generators of divide , fear , hate and euroskepticism . 
  if the brits did n't want to be a part of the eu , we should just accept that and let it go , the rest of us that do want more integration and a stronger and more united europe can proceed without having a big shrieking voice constantly screaming any time the eu tries to do something in the process of integration . 
  yeah , disagree . 
  nothing more to it , just disagreeing . 
   by allowing every barbaric islam practice like fgm , the burka , antisemitism and hateful anti-white speech . 
  it 's almost like in europe we give free speech to everyone , not just whites . 
  you act like only muslims are guilty of shady practices and hateful xenophobic speech . 
  there 's a big anti-refugee and anti-muslim ( both being interchangeable for people really ) sentiment going on right now . 
  anything that might show that maybe they are victims as well or anything that tries to humanize them in any way is pretty much downvoted , while every time an immigrant rapes someone it gets 2000 upvotes . 
  there 's also a lot of white supremacists lurking around these places nowadays , that does n't help either . 
  except it would n't work , how stupid do you have to be to believe that ? 
  that 's a way more pertinent question . 
  nukes are n't as destructive as people think . 
  it would take a lot of nukes to achieve something resembling a complete destruction of the usa or russia . 
  sure , you can argue that having 500 is enough to ensure at least a few dozen land , but a few dozen nukes would still live most of either the usa or russia intact . 
  you 're right that we made great strides , but simply reporting the state of things is n't something negative in itself . 
  there 's a lot of good news about romania on / r/europe as well , so you ca n't claim it 's some propaganda war or anything . 
  yeah , no , anti-immigration sentiment was a huge part of the brexit movement , especially immigration from eastern europe . 
  romanians and bulgarians were used as a scare tactic by the murdoch media in order to sell his tabloids . 
  you 're probably not as aware of all of that as we are , but it 's true . 
  my point was there 's a lot of stupid stereotypes about everyone . 
  people need to chill and realize you ca n't just paint whole nations or populations in some way or another . 
  i wonder why people get so uppity and offended when anyone mentions good news around here . 
  romania is growing fast and that 's a fact . 
  with our anti-corruption efforts and our politics being somewhat sane compared to many of our neighbors , things should go even better in the future . 
  there 's a very high possibility that the right will have an informal majority after the parliamentary elections in november , and all have said they will support dacian ciolos ( current pm ) , a technocrat , as prime-minister going forward . 
  the guy is actually competent and he 's well-intentioned , if he is to stay as prime-minister with parliamentary support from november onward , it will be the biggest break of good news romania got in the last 26 years . 
  anyway , i 'm really not sure why you 're so absolutely dismissive . 
  you really seem offended just because someone dared mention romania will overtake hungary . 
  it 's simply a guess based on current trends and nothing more , so chill . 
  considering how fast our gdp is rising it is actually a real possibility in about 5 years . 
  the forecasts are good for the next few years , at least as good as this year . 
  some of them probably do . 
  there 's a lot of idiotic stereotypes even among europeans . 
  do n't worry though southern european friends , us eastern europeans have it way worse . 
  brexit in part probably happened because of us . 
  well , they did fucking forge their documents to be fair . 
  why are people acting like it 's all the eu 's fault ? 
  he never said there were absolutely none in all of turkey , come on . 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  in any case , it 's pathetic how little most people know about turkey , they imagine it 's full blown islamic or something . 
  in reality they 're pretty close to eastern europeans , yes , most are religious , but the country is n't some extremely conservative hellhole . 
  i wonder what you mean by liberal , because one of the core principles of liberalism is equality for all and upholding civil rights , hence the contradiction . 
  you 're a very liberal person and you 'd support a slaughter against innocent people ? 
  yeah . 
  i do n't think so . 
   i mean , the overwhelming majority of black victims of homicide are in fact committed by other black people . 
  it helps no one to call these stats racist dude , what ? 
  i was specifically talking about the fact that donald trump spread false statistics specifically talking about how 81 % of whites are killed by blacks . 
  violence in ghettos is a huge issue , but spreading blatantly false statistics used by neo-nazis to `` prove '' that the vast majority of white people are killed by blacks does not however in any way help the situation . 
  in fact , not only does it not help , it makes it worse , especially when that kind of shit comes from a presidential candidate that has a shot at winning . 
  it really is non-defensible . 
  if you want to run for president of the usa you ca n't be going around posting extremely racist statistics , racist because they 're made-up by neo-nazis and exaggerated as fuck in order to fit a narrative of blacks being extremely violent and causing the vast majority of murders against white people . 
  making dumb ass statements like that is also seriously oversimplifying and downplaying what trump he 's doing , what he 's doing is inoculating people with extremely dangerous and dumb worldviews . 
  he says stuff like that or even worse on an almost weekly basis . 
  dude , it 's infuriating that you pretend those opinions are some fringe opinions that are n't representative , when it 's clearly the candidates own god damn rhetoric . 
  you ca n't pretend those opinions are not representative and that it 's unfair for me to generalize while at the same time supporting the candidate that is riling all of those feelings up by employing a rhetoric specially designed to do just that . 
  donald trump by the very nature of his campaign is guilty of generating the atmosphere we 're talking about and it 's absolutely blatantly obvious . 
  i mean just look at this shit : https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en seriously , look at it . 
  how on earth can you justify a man running for the most powerful position on the planet saying such shit ? 
  or this : http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/11/23/3724989/trump-tweets-fabricated-murder-stats-from-a-neo-nazi-and-this-is-how-the-media-reported-it/ or this : https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/449525268529815552?lang=en it 's from the man himself . 
  donald trump has absolutely no problems whatsoever using magical thinking , being anti-intellectual in nature and riling up divisiveness and hate against minorities by employing far right wing nationalist populist rhetoric . 
  when the candidate himself uses such rhetoric , is it truly unfair of me to say that the whole movement is tainted ?
