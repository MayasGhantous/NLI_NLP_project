  that 's what i 'm saying , it 's the basis of modern democracy . 
  equality in front of the law and the rule of law . 
  imprisonment and such is considered a limitation of the rights of an individual in order to punish , prevent and rehabilitate , but that is only after a fair trial . 
  that 's what makes the difference , ** a fair trial ** . 
  the migrants also need to be given a fair trial so we can determine which we can help and which we ca n't . 
  you and the far right simply want to slap labels on all of them like `` backwards rapist barbarians '' and then deny all of their rights and break our own laws in the process . 
  thanks . 
  exceptions like these should never be made in democracy . 
  once you start making exceptions to the rule of law , it 's all downhill . 
  the far right wo n't just stop there , wake the fuck up . 
  they will make one exception to `` protect '' us and then they will make many more exceptions to these silly things called laws , constitution , rule of law , democracy etc. 
  eventually they start making exceptions to things like voting , because who needs that . 
   yes and it is a bad thing . 
  we should change bad things . 
  http://democracyweb.org/node/36 it 's an essential part of modern democracy . 
  from wikipedia :  democracy consists of four key elements : ( a ) a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections ; ( b ) the active participation of the people , as citizens , in politics and civic life ; ** ( c ) protection of the human rights of all citizens ** , and ** ( d ) a rule of law , in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens . 
  ** so half of the 4 key elements are bad according to the far right . 
  but yea sure , they totally do n't want to ruin our democracies and piss all over the law . 
  my point is proven . 
  only morons and the far right thinks these are bad things . 
  if they broke any laws they should be dealt with accordingly , i 'm not advocating an exception to the law for anyone . 
  you 're just assuming that because you want to believe that anyone who sees through the extreme bullshit of the far right and their rhetoric is some rabbid leftist that thinks muslims are the best thing that ever happened to us . 
   the laws of which should be changed . 
  why ? 
  because you do n't like muslims ? 
  that 's how it should work . 
  laws that discriminate against a certain religion or ethnicity are better left in 1939 not 2016 . 
  have you ever heard of a passage in the constitution that exists in pretty much ever european country about the equality of all people in front of the law ? 
  yeah well , this is precisely what i meant when i said that the far right wants to piss all over the constitution and the law . 
  the rule of law implies protection of minorities , not discrimination against them , it is the basis of modern democracy . 
  if you do n't believe me look it up . 
  the far right wants to destroy this , it wants to destroy the rule of law , it wants to destroy our constitutions , then you have all these scumbags supporting them and calling others unpatriotic or self-hating because they do n't want to see modern democracy take a punch to the balls because some people just ca n't stand muslims . 
  i for one realize the importance of the rule of law and our democracies , and unlike you i do n't want us to slide into authoritarianism and backwards into middle age bullshit thinking . 
  you argue that the far right does n't want to break any laws or destroy our democracy , but that 's exactly what they want , they would see modern democracy put down on its knees just so they can have their piece of the pie . 
  you think they want to act our interest ? 
  you 're very naive if you think that , the far right has always profited and enriched themselves , they have the mania of control and getting a hold of all the power , pissing all over democracy and the law . 
  they start by changing constitutions and robbing constitutional courts of their power to oppose them , then they start disregarding laws outright whenever it suits them , you will see . 
  pis is already doing this in poland , orban is doing it hungary , putin in russia , and they 're not even far right , just nationalistic with some far right tendencies . 
  god forbid if actual far right parties win . 
  actually there is a lot wrong with being anti-migrant if that means breaking the law and disregarding the constitution . 
  i 'm talking about asylum requests , which we are legally obliged to process and give everyone a fair trial . 
  the anti-eu camp has a pretty big overlap with the anti-immigrant camp . 
  there are also many people on the eurosceptic side that are hostile towards minorities . 
  people have payed attention enough to notice that . 
  i 'm afraid to ask it , i 'm pretty sure you have some kind of an eyesight deficit . 
  are you not noticing the huge curve ? 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/exponential.svg let 's play a little game . 
  which one fits the most with your graph ? 
  in any case the population of every country has exploded during the 70 's and 80 's due to improved standards of living and medicine . 
  yeah no shit , leftist is the new preferred insult , it usually goes hand in hand with being `` self-hating '' or `` european culture hating '' or `` unpatriotic '' . 
  i 'm been called a leftist i do n't know how many times in arguments with these people even though i 'm pretty much center-right by all accounts . 
  it 's not atypical for highly authoritarian states to focus on the military-industrial complex in the detriment of things that are more useful to the population . 
  i assumed it was you because my replies to you have been downvoted in about 10 seconds after i post them . 
  so it 's either a bot or someone is very intently following our conversation . 
  i 'm thinking it 's the former . 
   and now i am back to studying , have a good day :p even this is an opportunity many poor minorities do n't really have . 
  i 'm all for individual responsibility , but sociology is understanding why certain cultures are the way they are and why certain groups display certain characteristics . 
  if you simply stop at the answer `` that 's just how they are '' , or `` it 's their culture '' , that simply means that you stopped thinking about the problem at a very superficial level without looking into the issue further and knowing why . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  lack of opportunities is definitely correlated to poverty , poverty and inequality are correlated with higher crime and so on . 
  this is all well known . 
  it 's simply a vicious cycle , that 's what people need to understand . 
  breaking these vicious cycles will benefit all of us in the end . 
  too many people have the mentality that `` i got mine , fuck everyone else '' . 
  also , why do you keep downvoting every post . 
  are you unable to have a discussion without using the downvote ? 
  if you ca n't connect the dots from a to b to c and you stop from a to b then you just need to make more of an effort . 
  saying it 's a cultural thing is simply stopping at making the connection from a to b and not thinking about the issue further . 
  why is it a cultural thing ? 
  well , because of external factors , not genetic , as we have already agreed . 
  can those external factors be related to their slavery , then heavy discrimination and racism ? 
  loss of opportunities and poverty ? 
  yes , it dose relate to that , as i 've already shown you , collectivism relates to poverty and all of it influences culture . 
  since we seem to be in such an agreement about these things , then all that 's left to do is for you to make the connection further about why racism and discrimination influences culture and why that in turn makes more racists , thus making racism correlated with culture a self perpetuating phenomenon . 
  that 's because you want to see racism accusations everywhere . 
  you ca n't wait to get called a racist or for someone to imply it , it 's your silver fucking bullet , then you can totally divert the whole argument and start calling the other person names like you did with me . 
  you 're doing the exact thing you 're accusing me of . 
  it 's ok though , because my argument stands on its own merits , not on whether you want to acknowledge what i said as true or not . 
  by the way , do you know that individualism and collectivism is correlated to poverty ? 
  as in , poorer societies are usually much more collective in nature , while improved standards of living often lead to a more individualistic society . 
   the relatively extreme individualism of american mainstream culture today is made possible by a high and dependable standard of living that allows self-sufficiency ( i.e. , independence ) to be the expected norm . 
  youth of american mainstream culture almost always have ready access to a substantial store of economic and social capital accumulated by their families . 
  this capital allows them to begin practicing independence and self-sufficiency at an early age and to be supported to achieve independence and self-sufficiency as they transition to adulthood . 
   by contrast , americans living in poverty generally have much lower levels of economic and social capital that can support independent lifestyles . 
  unfortunately , the social fabric of many low-income communities has become so frayed that effective interdependence may not be possible for many residents . 
  if one 's friends and relatives are unemployed , there 's little chance they can help the person get a job . 
  you 're insane . 
  the argument was that unless you think they are genetically inferior , then the causes are obviously external . 
  do you know how to read or understand a piece of text ? 
  or do you just have a huge stick up your ass and are looking to get offended ? 
  i agree that this is a disgusting way of debating , i mean your way , quickly making the argument out to be about accusations of racism while simultaneously calling me racist . 
  you do realize that blacks were still extremely discriminated against in the 50 's right ? 
  that 's when rosa parks happened . 
  in the south especially , racism never really died in a lot of parts . 
  the timeline is they were slaves -  then there was lots of racism and discrimination -  then in the 60 's things started improving but much of the racism sentiments remained . 
  racism is self-perpetuating , it marginalizes people and gives them less opportunities which usually means the group as a whole is going to be poorer , less educated , more prone to crime , then because of these things people justify their racism -  the cycle continues . 
  it 's a vicious cycle of lost opportunities and discrimination leading to more poverty and crime leading to more racism because people do n't understand the mechanisms . 
  unless you think blacks or muslims are genetically inferior , there is no logical reason to think that racism towards them is justified , because it is obvious that it is due to external causes that have a big connection with racism and discrimination in the first place . 
  the stereotypes about asians in general tend to be that you are very hard working , the whole `` a + '' stereotype and so on . 
  there may be racism towards asians , but it 's very different from the kind of stereotyping and racism towards black people or muslims .
