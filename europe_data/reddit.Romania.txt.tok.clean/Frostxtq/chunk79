  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy , a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position , without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
  did you educate yourself on whataboutism ? 
  because you 're still doing it . 
  i did n't even mention the usa in my post . 
  that says a lot . 
   `` what about ... '' followed by the naming of an event in the western world  without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
  yeah , you would say that , and you 'd be wrong . 
  nobody bullied anyone to join the eu , nobody bribed anyone either . 
  countries wanted to join , if offering them incentives like structural funds or free trade is now `` bribing '' or `` bullying '' then any kind of collaboration is bribing and bullying . 
  it 's absurd . 
   we can find even better target for comparison , usa !, 
  single language , many states were joined non-willfully , washington d.c. 
  does the usa have a russia like the ussr did ? 
  no it does n't . 
   the soviet union had its roots in the october revolution of 1917 , when the bolsheviks , headed by vladimir lenin , overthrew the provisional government that had replaced the tsar . 
  they established the ** russian ** socialist federative soviet republic ( renamed russian soviet federative socialist republic in 1936 )  the red army entered several territories of the former russian empire and * helped * local communists take power through soviets , which nominally acted on behalf of workers and peasants . 
   outside the territory of the russian federation , the republics were constituted mostly in lands ** that had formerly belonged to the russian empire ** and had been acquired by it between the 1700 great northern war and the anglo-russian convention of 1907 . 
  are you still going to pretend that the ussr was n't mostly russia and russia 's doing ? 
  i 'm only 3 minutes in and the guy is already full of shit . 
  a new kind of propaganda ? 
  making war feels acceptable ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  that shit has been going on for millenniums . 
  wow . 
  this documentary is terrible . 
  it takes whataboutism to a whole new level . 
  the usa used propaganda , absolutely fucking shocking . 
  it proves that both sides are exactly the same right ? 
  no it does n't and you 're an idiot if you believe it . 
   john richard pilger ( born 9 october 1939 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) is an australian journalist based since 1962 in the united kingdom . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] since his early years as a war correspondent in vietnam , pilger has been a strong critic of american , australian and british foreign policy , which he considers to be driven by an imperialist agenda . 
  yup . 
  can definitely see why the guy is some idol to you idiots . 
  it 's pointless to watch one hour of this , from the very beginning it starts off on the great reveal that the usa invented war propaganda . 
  that alone is so dumb and false that it puts the whole documentary into question . 
   pilger attacked the british-american project as an example of `` atlanticist freemasonry . '', 
  he asserted in november 1998 that `` many members are journalists , the essential foot soldiers in any network devoted to power and propaganda . 
  '' [ 73 ] in 2002 he said that `` many journalists now are no more than channelers and echoers of what orwell called the official truth . 
  '' [ 74 ]  in 2003 , he was scornful of pro-iraq war commentators on the liberal left , whom he called ` liberal interventionists ' , such as david aaronovitch , a `` right-wing provocateur '' who wears the mask of being a '' ` liberal ' '' . 
  [ 75 ] aaronovitch responded to an article by pilger about the mainstream media [ 76 ] in 2003 as one of his `` typical pieces about the corruption of most journalists ( ie people like me [ aaronovitch ] ) versus the bravery of a few ( ie people like him ) . 
  incredible . 
  i 'm starting to understand where all this bullshit comes from . 
  thanks for answering my question . 
  seriously . 
  what 's the eu 's capital ? 
  what 's the status of its member states ? 
  do we have an official language ? 
  are we all run by some dictator from brussels ? 
  did countries willfully join the eu ? 
  answer these questions to yourself and you will see why the eu and the ussr are not the same thing . 
  nice justification you have there for the occupation of romania and its subsequent including in the eastern bloc and the implementation of 50 years of dictatorship . 
  i do n't want to write out much of the same shit again , so you can read my response here regarding the great danger that romania posed for russia that `` justified '' it all : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4izgme/us_to_activate_800_million_missile_defense_site/d32usc7 if romania deserved 50 years of communism implemented by the ussr because of what the romanian nazi 's did after forcefully taking over power from king michael i , then germany should still be under russian rule even today , because at least the germans actually got to vote for hitler . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4izgme/us_to_activate_800_million_missile_defense_site/d33dluy read this . 
  russia cared for romania in the same way it cares for ukraine today , it wanted eastern europe to be under its sphere of influence and use it as a buffer zone . 
  how exactly do you think communism was implemented in romania ? 
  you either have no idea what you 're talking about , or you 're being willfully ignorant and omitting things or exaggerating others . 
  as you seem to know you 're shit otherwise , i 'm going to go with the latter . 
  russia may not have annexed romania or much of the rest of eastern europe , but pretending that they were n't the ones that propped the communist regimes and created the eastern bloc ? 
  really ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_romania  immediately following the august 23 , 1944 events , communists began to infiltrate the ministry of internal affairs on a large scale . 
  the general directorate of the security of the people ( romanian initials : dgsp , but more commonly just called the securitate ) was officially founded on august 30 , 1948 by decree 221/30 . 
  the securitate was set up by smersh , an nkvd unit charged with dismantling the existing intelligence agencies and replacing them with soviet-style bodies in the soviet-occupied countries of eastern europe . 
  the smersh unit in romania , called brigada mobil\u0103 , was led until 1948 by the nkvd colonel boris gr\u00fcnberg , also known in romania as alexandru nicolschi . 
  its stated purpose was to `` defend democratic conquests and guarantee the safety of the romanian peoples ' republic against both internal and external enemies . '', 
   after the conclusion of the armistice agreement in 1944 , soviet troops occupied the entire territory of romania . 
  estimates of troop levels vary between 750,000 and 1 million ( estimates of british military officials ) , to between 1 and 1.5 million ( estimates of the romanian general staff ) ; many western diplomats and experts refer to more than 1 million soviet troops . 
  [ 15 ]  on november 8 , 1945 , king michael 's name day , an anti-communist demonstration in front of the royal palace in bucharest was met with force , resulting in dozens of casualties . 
  soviet officers restrained romanian soldiers and police from firing on civilians , and soviet troops restored order so which is it ? 
  were you purposely lying or did you honestly did n't know ? 
  the second can be fixed , the first , not so much . 
  you 're full of shit . 
  the eu is absolutely nothing like the ussr . 
   u think this website is n't subject to shilling by the western intelligence services as much as the russians or whoever else ? 
  you know , i honestly do n't think that . 
  for better or worse , we have way more diversity in opinions , news sources , transparency and freedom of press than russia does . 
  so which are these views exactly and who do you see ardently supporting them ? 
  you 're really just inventing strawmen to attack . 
  for example , most people on this website know that the usa fucked up in iraq . 
  do you think most russians know that putin fucked up in georgia or crimea ? 
  they view it as some national fucking celebration . 
  feel free to provide proof of that shilling you 're talking about , or how apparently most people `` unquestionably '' support american imperialism . 
  what a crock of shit . 
  i mostly meant people from other countries that access sites like reddit and presumably read many of the same news we do . 
  but yeah ok , i got your point . 
  i know why many russians buy into it , i 'm more puzzled about why many kids west of russia buy into it . 
  let 's see . 
  russia was the most populous country of the ussr , moscow was its capital , most of the high ranking members came from russia , the official language was russian , russia is acknowledged as the direct successor of the ussr by everyone in the world including russia . 
  what more do you need ? 
  russia was the ussr . 
  the fact that they had a bigger empire spanning other territories does n't mean jack shit . 
  everything about the ussr was russian . 
  like i said , if people can claim germany was responsible for ww2 , then people can claim russia is responsible for what the ussr did as well . 
  not much , except you know , the fact that it makes russia unpredictable , unstable and dangerous . 
  `` i do n't believe either side '' does n't mean shit , since you did n't even point out what you do n't believe , what , you just straight up do n't believe anything anybody says ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  when the fuck was ukraine not european ? 
  who considers kazachstan european ? 
  you 're making shit up . 
  georgia is the only debatable one . 
  ok , my bad , i assumed you meant the west or whatever , since that 's what people usually claim , russia lies , but so does the west , ah-hah !,
