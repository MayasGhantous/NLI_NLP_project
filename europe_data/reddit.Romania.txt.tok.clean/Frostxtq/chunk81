  not sitting idly and believing that russia is n't a threat anymore is one of the best decisions eastern europe as a whole made . 
  countries that sat idly and trusted russia , such as ukraine , are seeing what that means today . 
  what ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism your whole comment is literally the definition of whataboutism . 
   whataboutism was a propaganda technique used by the soviet union in its dealings with the western world during the cold war . 
  when criticisms were leveled at the soviet union , the response would be ** `` what about ... '' followed by the naming of an event in the western world ** [ 1 ] [ 2 ] it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to ** hypocrisy ** , a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position , ** without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
  ** this is exactly the type of shit i 'm calling out . 
  thanks for making my point . 
  yeah , no . 
  russia is the direct successor of the ussr . 
  it 's like saying germany is n't responsible for ww2 because it was called nazi germany back then and hitler was austrian . 
  that 's ridiculous and it 's not how international politics work . 
   it was not disputed that turkey had a secular state , so fair enough . 
  by calling turkey an islamic country , that 's exactly what you disputed . 
  forget it , we 're just arguing semantics at this point . 
  i 'm saying turkey ca n't be islamic because it is secular , you 're saying turkey is islamic because the population is mostly religious . 
  one last thing though , what matters in the end is whether a country is secular or not . 
  countries ca n't force their population to be more or less religious , but they can be secular . 
  turkey made that choice . 
  if you still want to call the country islamic to fit your narrative , go right ahead . 
  i 'm done . 
  romania is one of the worst examples , that was kind of the point , that a country can still be secular despite having an overwhelmingly religious population . 
  bor does n't `` control '' the state , i agree that they have a pretty strong lobby , but it 's not like daniel runs the country . 
  the state does n't impose religion in schools , parents and kids can choose if they want to attend religious classes . 
  again , just because a lot of people are religious and bor has influence does n't mean that romania is n't secular , romania does n't have a state religion and it is not in fact controlled by bor , nor is anyone forced to adhere to any religion or learn about religion in schools . 
  that 's kind of my point , people do see it as black and white , it 's just that it seems like once people buy into the narrative russia is peddling they really are n't able to see the `` black '' in russia anymore . 
  remember when crimea was attacked ? 
  russian fanboys could n't for the life of them admit that russia is directly involved , despite it being extremely obvious for everyone else . 
  or when mh17 was shot down and people were claiming it was a plot by ukrainian 's to make russia looked bad . 
  now , again , people are pretending that russia is completely peaceful and not a threat to anyone , literally while they are taking parts of ukraine and georgia , threatening romania , the baltics , sweden and everyone else around them . 
  you 're right , the world is n't black and white , the difference is that while the rest of us see that , russian fanboys deny reality every chance they get . 
  then you have people like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ixqxa/deportation_of_crimean_tatars_in_1944_must_be/d32h94b ) that go so far as to deny that russia is the direct successor of the ussr because stalin was georgian . 
  absolutely mindblowing . 
  i can find countless examples on this sub of russian knights living in a parallel universe , eating up putin 's narrative . 
  remember the panama leaks ? 
  people were claiming it 's all a western plot to hurt putin and russia , it 's like they can not comprehend the fact that putin might actually be really corrupt and deserves all the criticism . 
  there 's really countless of examples of this happening lately . 
  people defending russia or putin even in the face of obvious evidence that they are in fact to blame . 
  basically the narrative boils down to anything negative that comes to light about russia is western propaganda . 
  i can understand the average russian believing it , since its all he hears on russian tv , but people that have access to the same internet everyone else has ? 
   the opposit of a secular country is a country with a state religion . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  a country is either secular , as in , it has no religion , or its a country with a state religion , the opposite of secular . 
  calling turkey an islamic country would mean that it 's theocratic or at the very least has islam as a state religion . 
  both of which are false . 
  thus , turkey is secular both by definition and in practice . 
  erdogan is n't some theocrat , he 's a wannabe dictator . 
  calling turkey islamic because most of the population is muslim is simply wrong and misleading , like i 've said romania is 98 % christian as well , but that does n't make us a `` christian country '' , claiming otherwise is just pushing a narrative . 
  what defines a country as religious or not is whether it is secular or not , that 's it . 
   from may 2012 , norway no longer has any state religion . 
  that 's one off the list . 
  the rest probably have a state religion simply out of tradition , as they are more secular in nature than most of the rest of the world . 
  but yeah , okay , the guy was taking about europe in a general sense and i 'm pretty sure he was n't only referring to denmark or england . 
  a country ca n't be religious if its secular . 
  that 's the point . 
  a secular country is literally the opposite of a country with a religion . 
  a population can be religious to varying degrees , but the country can still be secular . 
  i do n't know how you 're not getting this . 
  you probably are though , you 're just so far up your own ass you ca n't admit you 're wrong even when every argument , logic or evidence points to it . 
  pretty sure there was this big military parade just a couple of days ago celebrating your win over nazi germany . 
  are you actually arguing that russia is not a successor state of the ussr ? 
  wow , the amount of mental gymnastics you 're doing definitely deserves another olympic gold medal on behalf of russia . 
  not sure which , but most of them are for sure secular . 
  even romania is secular , despite being 98 % christian , which is turkey levels of religious . 
  serious question , while reading this topic i could n't help but wonder . 
  how the fuck do so many people buy into russian propaganda ? 
  i see the same points reiterated on this sub over and over again , russia is a good guy that is only defending themselves against western imperialism and propaganda . 
  do people really have their heads so far up their asses ? 
  are they just trying to be edgy and hate the west ? 
  do they all get their information from rt and russian funded websites ? 
  so many questions . 
  it 's just unbelievable that anyone with access to the whole of the internet can buy so much of the shit russia is peddling . 
  no , european countries are n't `` christian '' , that 's what secular means , a separation between church and state . 
  most of the population might be christian , muslim or whatever , but that does n't make the country theocratic . 
  what defines a country as secular or not is separation between church and state , not how much of the population is religious . 
  romania is a secular country as well , despite the fact that 98 % are christians . 
  you know nothing . 
  who exactly is `` hysterically panicking '' ? 
  you 're just making up strawmen to argue against . 
  countries take measures to protect themselves . 
  russia is a bully . 
  the sky is blue . 
  the end . 
  self-hating of the assimilated minorities ? 
  really ? 
  believe it or not , i 'm neither self-hating nor some crazed romanian nationalist , in fact i think i 'm pretty objective on the matter and if you disagree you can feel free to contradict me like you did with the number of jobbik voters . 
  for me though the issue is more than just jobbik , because fidesz with orban as its head also peddles nationalistic and populist rhetoric that a lot more people buy than just the 900k that vote jobbik . 
  i 'm a bit worried about what 's going on in hungary , but it does n't come from any kind of `` self-hate '' , it comes from genuine concern about where hungary 's democracy is headed and the state of its politics . 
  i see people buying into the nationalistic and populist hooks thrown by leaders such as orban and vona way too much to feel good about what 's going on in your country . 
  cooking books and then pretending its the other guy 's fault for believing the numbers is like robbing a bank and then blaming it on their bad security systems . 
  even if it 's true ( it 's not ) , it 's still greece that lied and did a bunch of illegal stuff just to get into the eurozone and then endlessly borrow to support their bloated and inefficient public sector . 
  right . 
  believe what you want . 
  however , do n't try to paint me as some nationalist with inferiority complexes , because i 'm neither . 
  from what ** i ** know , some of those lands did n't belong to hungary , if you believe all of those lands were their god given right , despite the fact that hungarians were a minority in some of them , then feel free to believe it , but then you might be the one with complexes , not me . 
  only wealthier countries * could * join , that 's kind of the point . 
  greece lied to be able to join even though they were n't ready . 
  this is n't debatable , it 's a proven fact . 
  dude , jobbik represents a segment of the hungarian population . 
  that 's all i was saying .
