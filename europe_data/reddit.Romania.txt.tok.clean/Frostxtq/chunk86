  countries were itching for it to settle their animosities and territorial claims . 
  yea but unlike putin , trump is n't a god emperor , as much as his supporters call him that . 
  trump ca n't do much because us democracy is well established with strong institutions as evidenced by the fact that he ca n't even pass a presidential order without it getting overturned . 
  you 're greatly exaggerating the state of the us while downplaying that of russia . 
  if you look at things objectively you quickly realize the us is nowhere near quasi-fascist , it still has a working democracy and checks and balances , trump may bark at the media but he is n't shutting them down or killing journalists and while the rhetoric is definitely on par with being as retarded as putin 's , the us institutions are too robust to allow trump to become a 2 ` nd putin . 
  yet the representatives of romanians and saxons were all for uniting . 
  ok , let 's take it one by one . 
   the eu is a corporate dominated the eu is by far the most consumer friendly entity in the world , so you could n't be more far off . 
  eu citizens enjoy more consumer protection rights than you can find anywhere on the planet and it 's one of the main reasons why many europeans were opposed to the tpp , fearing they will lose many of the environmental and consumer protections they enjoy . 
   undemocratic wrong . 
  i already explained that the eu works through the mutual collaboration of member state representatives and directly elected mep 's . 
  if anything , the heads of the member states hold way too much power as it is and it 's what is preventing a lot of progress from happening inside the eu . 
   that may destroy all that is good about europe . 
  except for the part where most of what is good about europe today is a consequence of the eu and the closer and closer union between the people of europe . 
  in fact , the whole reason for the existence of the union was to prevent another major conflict between the major european powers . 
  in this sense , europe has never been more united and further away from conflict between its member states . 
   germany always gets what they want citation needed . 
   you know the last time the germans held so much power in europe +20 points for seriously comparing nazi germany to the european union . 
  congrats , you win the dummy award . 
  also lul @ the canadian giving people lessons on / r/europe based on the shitty conspiracy theories they read on breitbart and other pit sties calling themselves media outlets . 
  i mean , to be fair , it 's no surprise you would fall for that shit , you reek of ignorance on both politics and history . 
  it 's just a rough estimation based on the fact that romanians and saxons wanted to unite while hungarians ( aprox . 
  30 % of the population ) were against it . 
  in any case it 's definitely between 60-70 % . 
  so a pretty large majority all things considered . 
   how does giving more power to an elitist , undemocratic group of bureaucrats help anyone ? 
  especially when muslims are currently trying to take over the continent . 
  pretty much all you 've just said is just bullshit far-right talking points . 
  worst part is it 's also wrong as fuck . 
  it has been explained to you countless times how the eu works and why it is n't actually undemocratic , as it works through elected representatives of the states and directly elected meps working together . 
  also , +10 points for mentioning the invasion of europe by muslims like it 's the crusades . 
   i did n't say anything about race i 'm not racist gusi i did n't say anything about race only about them filthy fucking muslim invaders . 
  see ? 
  inb4 muslims are n't a race , islam is n't a race etc. 
   [ racism is discrimination and prejudice towards people based on their race or ** ethnicity ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism ) it just sounds better than xenophobia . 
  what can ya ' do . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af edit : shit , my guy is missing his left arm . 
  i do n't even know how to respond to that except that it 's obvious revisionist history especially if you compare it with the russian annexation of crimea . 
  we 're talking about world war i here , not putin trying to expand his sphere of influence in the year 2014 . 
  this is what bothers me about hungarians , and i 'm speaking from the pov of being half hungarian myself . 
  it bothers me that hungarians ca n't seem to let go of history and choose to still be butthurt over things that happened 100 years ago and they ca n't just let them be . 
  other nations have managed to do that and it does n't make them fools , that 's how things should be . 
  from wiki :  following defeat in world war i , austria-hungary disintegrated . 
  the ethnic romanian majority in transylvania elected representatives , who then proclaimed union with romania on december 1 , 1918 . 
  the proclamation of union of alba iulia was adopted by the deputies of the romanians from transylvania , and supported one month later by the vote of the deputies of the saxons from transylvania . 
  so if you really wan na compare it with the brexit , it was n't a 52-48 % result that is just close enough to make it questionable , 70 % of the population of transylvania wanted to unite with romania , made up of a majority of romanians and the saxons . 
  it 's more than a majority , there were almost twice as many romanians living there than hungarians , you ca n't just count all the saxons and other minorities living there as `` hungarian '' . 
  like i said in an other post it all depends on whether you consider the rights of the ethnic romanian majority to decide to unite with romania more important than hungary 's political/military claim over it or not . 
  because the principalities that later united to form romania were actually united for a brief time before , just not under the modern name of `` romania '' . 
  feels like we 're just arguing semantics though . 
  i 'm half hungarian so i 'm not that much into the whole hurr durr `` it 's ours '' `` no it 's ours '' bullshit nationalism some people feel so passionately about . 
  transylvania belongs to the people living here . 
  it just so happens that the vast majority of people living here are romanian and always have been . 
  now whether it was fair or not for hungary to lose transylvania after owning it for such a long time , i 'm really not interested in having that debate on reddit with what seems to be a bunch of butt hurt people , because it all depends on whether you consider the rights of the ethnic romanian majority to decide to unite with romania more important than hungary 's political/military claim over it or not . 
  and how many romanians ? 
  why do hungarians never recognize the fact that transylvania had a majority population of ethnic romanians . 
  not romania in the modern sense , as it has only existed since 1854 , but transylvania had a romanian majority population for many centuries and have actually united for a very brief time in the 17 ` th century . 
  russia is way more dangerous . 
  your word vs the collective intelligence agencies of the united states . 
  i 'll take yours . 
  not . 
  there is nothing wrong with that article on wikipedia , it not only provides sources but it is also widely known at this point that the american intelligence agencies have confirmed the russian hacking of the dnc . 
  the russian hacking of the dnc servers , not the russians literally faking votes you lying little bastard . 
  you do n't even know what 's being talked about . 
  there 's also no arguing with you because you 've immediately excluded any kind of evidence i could provide as `` fake news '' and `` fake intelligence agencies confirming fake attack '' . 
  you 're basically asking me to show you what is classified information that is currently being used in investigations . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_interference_in_the_2016_united_states_elections there you go . 
  now i 'm expecting you to hysterically claim it 's all fake news , that all the agencies are just conspiring against the god emperor and that you wo n't believe anything until they personally show you the exact way in which the russians did it . 
  for what claims ? 
  the claims you made up ? 
  the claims you 're imagining others are making ? 
  you 're right , it 's pretty hard to find evidence for claims that nobody is making except you . 
  show me where people claim the russians messed with the votes in the election ? 
  but then you look at the statistics and you realize that no , not really . 
  it just makes it worse . 
   the russian hacking story was 100 % fake news , unless you can tell me how they `` hacked '' the election with non networked voting machines ? 
  they sent russian operatives to every single us voting station ? 
  nope my sides . 
  this is n't even the claim that is being made , like you are n't even close , if anything , this is much closer to what trump was claiming with the millions of illegal votes and the rigged elections . 
  how are you going to tell me you know the allegations are `` fake news '' when you 've literally made them up and do n't even know what the real allegations are ? 
  it 's beyond ** ironic ** that you 're accusing fake news while making shit up nobody is claiming and then calling it `` fake '' . 
  it 's also insane but that 's a different story . 
  / facepalm, 
  no , that 's what direct democracy is . 
  representative democracy is where we elect people that know better to choose what is best , which also implies listening to what the people want , but it does n't always imply always doing what `` the people '' want either , especially when the people want something contrary to the law . 
  also the people is n't some unitary being that wants only one thing either , so i 'm pretty tired of hearing `` the people '' this the people that . 
  believe it or not sometimes things are complex enough that the people do n't really have the solution . 
  the humanitarian crisis europe faced could n't be solved by just closing down everything , quite the contrary it would 've 100 % have been the wrong decision which would have caused massive amounts of human suffering . 
  and for what ? 
  to placate the rise of the far right ? 
  i and many europeans i hope would not like to turn our backs on everyone that needs our help in their darkest times just because we 're playing politics and do n't want to give ammo to those pesky populists . 
  not that it matters anyway since they usually make shit up anyway . 
  that simple huh ? 
  this illustrates perfectly why populists are having a field day . 
  reducing very complex problems , and basically a huge humanitarian crisis , to a shitty slogan about closing the borders . 
  not sure if sarcastic or not . 
  but giving blessings is n't the same as giving money to extremist political parties , using your state propaganda machine to help them and hacking the political opposition in order to smear them . 
   he never said he did n't take part in it . 
  dude , literally his words from the video you 're using as proof . 
   i was only a spectator , the property was being taken away .
