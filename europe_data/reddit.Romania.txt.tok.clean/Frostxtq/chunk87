  so , ** i had no role ** in taking away that property . 
  so i have no sense of guilt . 
  he was 14 . 
  of course he was a spectator . 
  seriously who do you think is going to let a 14 year old go around confiscating goods ? 
  lol , that 's preposterous . 
  it was his `` godfather '' , a government official , that was doing the confiscating . 
  this is n't a lie , it 's obvious once you read the whole context and use a bit of common sense , which is why he said he felt no guilt . 
  no where in the video does he state he was ratting out people . 
  i mean , you must view him as some caricature of a comic book villain if you really think he came out in an interview to tell the world how he was working with the nazis and ratting out hiding jews and did n't feel sorry for it . 
  seriously . 
  that 's just retarded , even if it were true that he did all those things . 
  fact is you used a manipulated quote taken out of context that leaves out the parts where he said he was only a spectator and had no role . 
  maybe you should double check your info , maybe you 're basing your beliefs on misrepresented facts . 
  why do n't you look at the video yourself and see the relevant part ? 
  it 's nothing like your quote , but quite the opposite , he repeatedly says he only watched and had no role . 
   i also noticed you completely ignored him being part of a recognized nazi program that had ranks and everything called judenrat . 
  because you provided no source or proof of anything like that . 
  the only thing you mentioned was the video and used a wrong quote that leaves out vital pieces for understanding it . 
  am i to assume the rest of your claims are valid despite not indicating any evidence ? 
  yeah but that 's assuming the younger generations wo n't want to join a federalized europe either , or not in significant numbers . 
  i think that as the world and technology progress , more and more people are going to strive for a more united human kind . 
  the first step is going to be creating these large federal blocs that encompass big regions of the planet . 
  the distance between us becomes smaller and smaller with each passing generation and each new breakthroughs in communication , travel and information . 
  the world is becoming more global , that 's just a fact . 
   most young people get more conservative as they get older otherwise the tories would never in an election . 
  or you know , they just stay kind of the same while each younger generation is more liberal . 
  it 's not like if you support gay marriage when you 're 25 you 're going to be against it at 50 , it 's just that by the time you 're 50 the 25 year olds are gon na want marriage equality for robots or some shit while you 're there screaming about how humanity is doomed . 
  as for conservative parties such as the tories , they do n't stay the same either , conservative does n't mean unchanged for a hundred years , so the conservative party of tomorrow might very well reflect the liberals of today . 
  like for example in the us the republicans fought against gay rights for a long time but today not even they are that much against it and will probably not do anything to reverse it . 
  conservative parties always have a base especially in the older folk because there 's always going to be conflict between generations in how they view the world , while the older ones usually want to preserve what they got used to growing up , the younger ones usually want to make the world progress in order to catch up their more liberal worldview . 
  first of all , thank you for an actual response instead of just accusing me of being a wall . 
  now we can have a proper conversation . 
  second of all , i feel like i 'm taking crazy pills . 
  we both have the same video at our disposal yes ? 
  it 's not a doctored video yes ? 
  you quote this :  `` there was no sense that i should n't be there . 
  ** if i was n't doing it ** , somebody else would be taking it away anyhow . 
  whether i was there or not . 
  so i had no sense of guilt . '' what he actually said , word for word , as you can clearly hear in the video :  `` if i were n't there , ** because i was n't doing it ** , but somebody else would be taking it away anyhow . 
  whether i was there or not , ** i was only a spectator ** , the property was being taken away . 
  so , ** i had no role in taking away that property ** . 
  so i have no sense of guilt . 
  word for word . 
  clearly audible . 
  your '' `` quote '' '' is deliberately modified in such a way as to become an admission of guilt . 
  the actual quote , word for word , in full context , has him clearly stating that he was n't actually doing the confiscating , but was merely a spectator and that he had no role in what was happening , which is why he feels no guilt . 
  watch the video from the timestamp i indicated till the end of that segment to see that i 'm not actually lying , i 'm not trying to apologize for what the nazis did and i 'm not `` parsing '' as you 're accusing me of doing . 
  i literally just watched the video with no preconceptions , listened to the exact words i quoted , and could not for the life of me draw the conclusion that he did what you 're accusing him of . 
  why ? 
  because that 's not what he said , what he said is the complete opposite , that he did n't have any role in it and that is why he does n't feel guilty . 
   i 'm talking to a wall here i gave you well thought out arguments based on the video you mentioned as proof . 
  you double down and accuse me of being inflexible in my beliefs and then run away from the argument . 
  ** the irony . 
  ** you are so adamant in your hate for him you 're making up what he said in order to justify it . 
   nazi collaborator apologists . 
  and your proof is a video in which he says he did n't actually do anything except watch what the man that took him in did . 
  14 . year old . 
  it boggles the mind how much irrational hate you need in order to put blame on a 14 year old jewish boy that was separated from his family for what happened during the holocaust . 
  i know the interview where he said that and you 're misinterpreting it . 
  he was a child at the time and he was taken in by that man , which probably saved his life . 
  it 's true that his `` godfather '' was responsible for confiscating the wealth of jews , the guy was n't a nazi officer either , but a government official , and that soros had to accompany him , but he did n't `` point said nazis '' to hiding places , that 's just something you added . 
  he basically assisted to what his adoptive `` godfather '' did , and he said he did n't feel any guilt over it . 
  he had to pretend to be someone else in order to survive , he was n't the one doing the confiscating and he was n't the one pointing them to their hiding places . 
  he was a kid in a shitty situation which he had no control or responsibility over . 
  when he said he felt no guilt over it , what he meant is that he did n't feel responsible for what he had seen during that time period or over the fact that he survived when so many got shipped off . 
  considering he was just a kid trying to survive through the holocaust , i really do n't understand how some people can be so cruel as to think he should 've felt guilty or ashamed or that he 's some monster for saying he did n't feel guilty for what was happening at the time . 
  he.was.a.child . 
  for fucks sake , i doubt he even understood the full ramifications of what was going on . 
  how can people blame a child for the horrors of the holocaust is beyond me . 
  https://off-guardian.org/2016/11/20/soros-60minute-video/ it starts at minute 8 . 
  he clearly says he was a spectator and that he did n't actually do anything . 
  how could he ? 
  again , he was a child at that time , with no real understanding of what was going on , his only crime was assissting to those events . 
  actually he has said he is n't going to go for a 2 ` nd term . 
  never say never . 
  most young people for example were pro-remain , so how do you know what 's going to happen in 30 years ? 
  sentiments might be quite favorable towards the eu , they might not be , but the point is you or i ca n't predict the future . 
  however , based strictly on how young people in the uk view the eu , there is a good case to be made for that . 
  of course the favorable sentiment might die down now that you wo n't be a part of the eu anymore , but it might also rise if people perceive your government to be incompetent and think a supranational organization might be more beneficial . 
  how was soros a nazi collaborator ? 
  he was 13 or 14 at that time . 
  a child . 
  how much evidence can a person ignore ? 
  seems like a lot if it contradicts their dearly held beliefs . 
  the russian hacking is all but confirmed by everyone except the russians themselves , it isnt fake news . 
  the only debatable thing is whether trump colluded with them during his campaign . 
  although that isnt really debatable either considering the growing list of trump vip 's that have met or worked with the russian 's during the campaign or in the recent past and trump 's secret meetings with the russian ambassador . 
  not really . 
  a more likely explanation is the lack of natural resources . 
  they can be a real curse for a lot of countries , such as russia . 
  when most of a country 's income relies on it , there 's going to be a big incentive for authoritarians or oligarchs to parasite the extraction sector and funnel all the wealth into their own pockets . 
  that is much harder to do with a diversified economy that does n't really rely on any natural wealth . 
  ww1 and ww2 were n't started because of democracy , quite the lack of rather . 
  not really . 
  the us and europe feed off each other . 
  this time it was europe that went ballistic first with far right parties surging across the board . 
  only then was trump a thing . 
  yeah , in exchange for guarantees like reforms . 
  nobody wants to throw money in a black hole .
