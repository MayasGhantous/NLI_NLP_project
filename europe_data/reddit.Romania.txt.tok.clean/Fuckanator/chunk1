sweden , yes !, 
  from their perspective : if there 's a road , why not build on it instead of adjacent to it where you 'd have to construct a road , maintain it etc. 
  from a commuter/driver 's perspective : you fucking living speedbumps , do i have to slow down for every 50m patch of land ? 
  same here in romania , i thought we were the only tards . 
  sweden , yes !, 
  so , by your logic , to up it by one level on the `` enlightenment '' scale , a country that would essentially remove borders and border control and would offer unlimited benefits would be better and more `` progressive '' than us/eu ? 
  yes , when the dutch went to japan they exchanged cultural ideas and technology without migrating , just by trading . 
  [ some cultures are shittier than others ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jxrdwtiqqs ) . 
  polan , no !, 
   religion 101 . 
  most ( successful ) religions have code built into them to : they 're just like a virus/plague as far as you 've described them , attach to host , spread the `` gene '' . 
  over 500 million people in the eu , fam . 
  odd , we always called it `` cehia '' ( czechia ) here , well at least after czechoslovakia fell . 
  nah , i get 80 % and even up to 110 % of my speed on any servers across europe and pretty much the same deal in na . 
  on any server on the map i get over 35 % of my promised speed and a lot of times it 's on the server side . 
  so no , you 're wrong . 
   the point of using the gun is to neutralize your target with extreme prejudice . 
  police should n't be street killers , they should serve and protect , they should be trained to restrain and not kill anyone who * might * be problematic ( not talking about this case specifically ) . 
  i 've seen way too many trigger happy cop videos killing when the situation did n't call for it . 
  i do n't know , maybe it 's just me but i 'd rather not shit my pants and fear for my life if i anger a copper . 
  yes , that 's what i was saying , you do n't ** have ** to use it , only if the situation calls for it . 
  it can be used to de-escalate things without having to actually use it . 
  how about intimidation ? 
  forcing a person to stop in his tracks ? 
  what happened to `` stop or i 'll shoot '' , is it now `` stop , or do n't , i 'll still shoot since i drew my gun out '' . 
  muh guns . 
  for the sexual thrill , of course !, 
  it 's sort of undecided and bipolar . 
  they started placing corrupt politicians in jail , and they `` wrote '' ( some people that failed high school ) books and the law stated that writing those would cut a few months off of your time . 
  they decided to remove that and actually punish the people ( doctors/univ . 
  professors ) that wrote the books for them . 
  now they are thinking of actually defaulting back to it . 
  another instance of implementing a law and thinking of defaulting to its original state is the anti-smoking law that passed not too long ago ( public smoking ban indoors and near playgrounds ) . 
  this law proposal ( itt ) is probably just to send a message to the tobacco `` lobby '' about them paying up . . or else . 
  i mean , there are several people out there that push these laws that make sense and punish corruption but they are a minority and the majority of the political class still has influence over it and are pushing hard , only thing backing up a handful of righteous people are us , the people , the general population . 
  it ' not a comparison , it 's an analogy . 
  why is it ironic ? 
  he 's pretty sure . 
   we do n't need those types of comments in here of all places . 
  are you suggesting we turn this into a. . . safe space ? 
  you 're talking to sweden . . do n't use / s , they take everything literally . 
  you 're calling him a racist while at the same time saying he should n't be allowed to comment here based solely off his flag/ethnicity . 
  oh the irony . 
  leave poland alone !, 
  he wants positive and pc friendly news, 
  well . . hitler also was anti-smoking ... we should promote smoking and ban anti-smoking ads since they are what nazis would 've done !!!, 
  what 's wrong with securing a future for our children ? 
   what more could they possibly want ? 
  clay, 
  romania , the progressive capital of the world confirmed, 
  no offense but that 's pretty cringe worthy . 
  huffpost gave donald 1 % chance to win and hillary 99 % ( or 97 % ) . 
  * 99 % chance of winning * * at least 50 points ahead *, 
  nope , a drunk american tourist giving a * heil * is n't * uprising * . 
  huh ? 
  why ? 
  yes , comrade , glory will be ours !, 
  think he was being sarcastic , lol . 
  from an economic standpoint i 'd rather the soviets had n't won , communism in e. europe was n't that great , and the russian `` liberators '' were n't all that great for our women . 
  my opinion might be skewed since we were germany 's ally during ww2 but most citizens from occupied territories usually preferred german occupation as opposed to soviet one . 
  [ here 's a bit of information ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ ) , there was a pew research somewhere conducted where around 10-20 % of the total population was in favour of imposing strict laws ( like sharia ) which includes corporal punishments and even death ( for leaving the community , for being gay etc. ) . 
  in the mean time , check the link i posted and go from there . 
  it only takes one or two , statistically speaking , out of every 10 muslims , 2 adhere to that principle among other * extremist * views . 
  it 's not the countries you should fear but the people adhering to that principle . 
  not wanting to die is a pretty good reason . 
  the punishment for leaving islam is death . 
  how so ? 
  maybe not all break its tos , some might just have offended easily offended people ( of whom are a a shitload nowadays ) . 
  if that triggers you , leave twitter , it 's a service , no one 's forcing you to use it . 
  hi golvan , how 's life ? 
   plus the banning of trans people from the military does n't help emotionally unstable people undergoing transitioning ( being pumped with hormones ) really should n't be in the military , what 's bad about that ? 
   i 'd say the point of view that is advocated by you is needlessly pedantic . 
  not at all , same way i hate it when people use * literally * as a way to emphasize certain actions , fuck that . 
  if it goes unchecked it will become the norm , let 's not dumb down things , shall we ? 
   people are used to call it `` per capita '' , and to throw out a good , concise term just because in a used scale of units it does n't follow strict etymological meaning , it just seems impractical to me . 
  why ? 
  this is the first time i 've seen it misused to be honest . 
  op could 've phrased that as `` number of metal bands per country in europe '' which would have been correct . 
  it 's like saying `` per household '' but actually referring to `` per capita '' because * it sounds nice * . 
  do you see no difference between , let 's say , ** gdp ** and ** gdp per capita ** ? 
  they are ** not ** interchangeable . 
  so , let 's agree to disagree , just because the author feels like using * per capita * in this instance does n't mean he 's right . 
  not all words , but specifically this one is mostly used rightfully , just because op does n't know what * per capita * means does n't mean it 's being misused en mass for any statistical purpose . 
  it 's like me using * percentage * for any statistic , e.g. 
  : 1/3 percentage of people are idiots . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but `` per capita '' , specifically * capita * is latin for * head * , so this basically translated to `` per head '' or ** `` per individual '' ** , it 's wrong to use it for anything related to statistics , it 's like using `` percent '' for everything statistical as well when referring to a portion , it 's plain wrong and misleading . 
  growing up with fanta you kinda get used to the taste , mirinda ( orange ) was something new and different , i like it more , neither taste like orange , not even a hint but eh , personally i prefer bitter tasting soft drinks ( schweppes bitter lemon/tonic water ) and i do n't usually drink them that much . 
  schweppes bitter lemon master race here . 
  how can other soft drinks even compete ? 
  but mirinda ** is ** better than fanta . 
  dr. pepper is too fucking sweet , you get the regular 5 pounds a sugar per can but this shit has like 50 . 
   slow yeah , rub it in , kraut . 
  oh no , the un !, 
  ... and uniforms . 
  before 9/11 ? 
   maybe god has phimosis i had phmosis when i was a kid , underwent corrective surgery when i was 7 , ** not ** circumcision . 
  i had my foreskin pulled back ( as if i were circumcised ) for about 1-2 weeks giving it time to heal , i could n't walk right , because it was very sensitive ( it would touch my thighs while walking ) , but i guess people that get circumcised gradually lose sensitivity so it does n't bother them in the long run . 
  just pull your foreskin back ( use duct tape or whatever ) and try sitting down , walking and doing everyday things , it 's incredibly uncomfortable . 
  if it would enforce `` these regulations '' ( obscure agreement with an agenda behind it , read the bloody agreement , goes from cc to feminism ) across the board , fine . 
  but there are countries exempt from these regulations .
