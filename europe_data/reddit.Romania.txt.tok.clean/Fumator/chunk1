my parents sent it all to a lawyer and he took care of it . 
  have n't heard of them again . 
  wait , you payed 5k eur for an album ?!, 
  in the last month i 've downloaded several tv shows , movies that have around 300 gb . 
  if i lived in de i would 've had to sell my house to pay those `` loses '' . 
  thankfully , i live in ro where nobody gives a shit as long as you do n't try to sell it . 
  fast internet speeds and relaxed copyright laws - that 's how heaven looks like . 
  meh ... she 's hot , it does n't matter . 
  in 2009 romania was hit pretty hard by the economical crisis and the gdp dropped a lot and stagnated , whereas belarus stagnated and increased . 
  in 2014 we 've recovered and surpassed them again . 
  if you 'd look at those stats , you 'll see that their gdp was still growing for 2014 and was predicted to drop in 2015 due to the sanctions . 
  except for 2011 and 2013 , ours was bigger in the last 24 years . 
  nope , in the [ last 24 years ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:by:ro&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) , only in 2011 and 2012 their gdp was bigger and in 2010 and 2013 were equal . 
  wtf , our gdp ppp is bigger than theirs . 
  more like 500 - internal country error . 
   baltic assembly and when you guys make an assembly , captain baltic appears to save the day . 
  also , keep in mind that usually you 're not that focused on the uniform , especially if the text it 's on the back . 
  fudge , let 's hope they do n't hear about our internet speeds ... 
  it 's not , but they are doing pretty well considering they have democracy for only 25 + years . 
  actually , from what i know , it 's the richest post-communist country in europe . 
  [ nope ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:ro:pt:si&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  the whales commit suicide by harpoon ? 
  troll , more like it . 
   what have the romans ever done for us ? 
  he 's romanian too ... 
  rds-rcs offers services in hungary - broadband , italy and spain - prepayed mobile plans . 
  from what i understand , in italy they have unlimited mobile internet for 10 eur : https://www.digimobil.it/nelimitat/index_it.php probably the speeds are not so good because i do n't think they have their own infrastructure . 
  ha , in yo ' face , hungary !, 
  ah you think poverty is your ally ? 
  you merely adopted to be poor . 
  i was born in it , molded by it . 
  i did n't see money until i was already a man , by then it was nothing to me but credit cards !, 
  we por contri , no sarcasm here . 
  average wage in moldova is around 170 eur , and minimum around 80 ( ? ) . 
  soo . . not really . 
  probably they earn more because they might have a big shadow economy . 
  you 'll be surprised what names romanians give these days to their children . 
  names like david , emma , sophia , olivia , jacob , ethan , corado , maya , alexia , alice , patricia are popular ; heck , i 've heard a lot of `` david `` s at the local mall . 
  man , i wish we had infrastructure and local administration like that in romania too . 
  it 's something wrong with that poll , we ca n't be second place . 
   dirty work to outside parties like usa , turkey , and russia . 
  or hungary . 
  dan , is that you ? 
  why not piscul palinka ? 
  not funny if you knew that the poor guy was online harassed by some hungarian morons because he had the romanian flag and not the hungarian one ... google translation of an romanian article from last year  he faced death trying to carry the romanian flag on the highest mountain in the world and now is harassed by an invisible enemy . 
  climber zsolt torok , surprised by the devastating earthquake in nepal everest , is the target of dozens of nationalist threat messages on the internet  on top of the highest mountains , zsolt torok is the world 's citizen , but he always wear the romanian flag . 
  his country . 
  he had the flag on everest when the huge avalanche buried alive . 
  climber and his flag survived the disaster . 
  the joy of homecoming was overshadowed them of malice but of hidden enemies online . 
   there was a shooting nationalist messages that accused him of treason climber ethnic hungarian nation . 
   among hundreds of threats and thrown manipulated pictures on social networks in the name of zsolt torok says he 's the target of a campaign of denigration . 
   zsolt torok all evidence of harassment filed a complaint to police in arad . 
  the authorities need to discover now who are enemies hiding on the internet . 
  are you sure it was n't a ninja ? 
  you know , women can be ninjas too . 
  are there ny news/opinion in ukraine about us ? 
  you mean peaceful and stable democratic countries ? 
  those are the worst . 
   but i must add , i do n't agree that russia is the biggest aggressor . 
  on words maybe , action , not so much . 
  but that 's just my 2 cents . 
  i disagree in this . 
  sure , russia wo n't directly invade nato ee - especially when they do n't have any reason ( e.g. 
  my country does n't have a russian minority ) . 
  most likely , it will try to manipulate them covertly for it 's benefit . 
  however , countries like ukraine are already suffered military aggression . 
  probably belarus/moldova would be next if the government becomes pro-eu . 
   bulgaria a lot of people are sympathetic to russia , maybe a lot more than any other country in eastern europe except serbia . 
  the neighbors are really weird ... 
  do n't change the subject , ruski propaganda minion . 
  the subject is about ** russia ** . 
  after they destroy their own boats . 
  ferrying them over and spreading them over eu is not a solution . 
  italy should push for a eu-wide coast guard because , let 's be honest , is not right for only you to protect those borders and landlocked countries to just bitch about it . 
  yep , same here , it 's musaca in romanian . 
  i was talking about products in general . 
  people buy products mostly based on brands , so really does n't matter . 
  as for cars , i think that if someone wants an audi , bmw or whatever he does n't care about that tax and most likely wo n't buy from a `` local '' brand . 
  wo n't the import taxes be paid by the british customer in the end ? 
  average citizens in the baltic countries and in poland live better and are richer than an average russian citizen . 
  kinda hurts your pride considering they do n't have your natural resources or population . 
  that 's the best revenge those ee countries could have . 
  somebody said the `` m '' name ... 
  prepare to be assaulted by g ( r ) eeks . 
  that 's nothing . 
  there 's a tradition in some village ( ruginoasa ) in ro in which the people beat the shit of each other with sticks every new years eve : https://youtu.be/3x8nyhis-em?t=24s from what understand , it 's some kind of tradition-feud between two villages and each year they dress up with those masks and hit the rival villagers with sticks and in some years even with stones . 
  that 's brutal - there were cases when people end up in a coma . 
  shut up , european mississippi . 
  so the hot potato syndrome is actually true ... 
  are you in the navy or you work in a bar ? 
  do you live in a village ? 
  heck , even telekom offers 8mbps in villages where there is n't fiber . 
  but we do n't have free healthcare in ro if you do n't contribute . 
  it 's probably the same in austria . 
  you know the saying about old chicken and soup ... 
   for these prices , i plan on having all providers just because ... are you planning to build a fricking datacenter in your basement ? 
  i doubt that . 
  the stats are messed up , at least for us . 
  the rural population does n't have jobs at all and are ignored in the employment statistics .
