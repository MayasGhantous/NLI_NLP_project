  in the village where my grandparents are 90 % do n't have a job and rely on subsistence agriculture . 
  ahem ... my phone can record 1080p videos ... 
  stop treating them like kids , they are n't . 
  they know damn well what it 's bad and what 's not . 
  or a plane , 
  smart guy . 
  yesterday was the lowest gbp rate of 4.98 ron for 1 gbp i 've ever seen . 
  last year the highest was above 6 ron for 1 gbp . 
  there are hundreds of incidents in 3 years in only ** one county in romania ** ( thefts , beatings , rapes , etc ) made by the local population . 
  those incidents are still present in the romanian archives . 
  anyway , no matter how much evidence we will post , you 'll still use the russian `` infallible '' counterargument : `` what proof ? 
  there 's no proof '' even though you have n't posted any to contradict them . 
  good luck living in russia , i 've heard is a pleasant country to live in , especially when it comes to free speech . 
  i havent downvoted you , the only one i downvoted is the russian guy who thinks his country saved the entire continent . 
  yes , i 'm aware that the romanian soldiers did horrific acts . 
  as for forgiveness , i personally do n't give a shit about what the russians are doing as long as they do n't try to meddle in any manner ( manipulation , sponsorships , etc ) with my country affairs . 
  however , what i ca n't stand is the current russian high-horse attitude that they liberated countries i should be grateful for that and in fact they were the good guys . 
  yep , goebbels invention , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre oh , i suppose that one does n't count , right ? 
  they are not my heroes when they annexed a part of my country when it was neutral , russia 's heroes sure . 
  as for the romanian heroes - i personally think that in a war there are no heroes but people that are struggling to keep their humanity . 
  people become vicious animals in this kind of environments . 
  i wo n't try to make a serious response to your comment . 
  however , you might learn a few things from [ here ] ( https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/figuratively-literally/ ) . 
  yeah , everybody is a fascist according to you when you do n't like the facts . 
  the truth is we were neutral and you annexed a part of our country . 
  stop pretending you were the angelic heroes liberating the continent , because we both know it is n't true . 
  as for the goebbels remark you 've made , i hate the nazi as much as i hate the ussr , probably more . 
  that 's why every german stereotype is about women in dresses with big cleavage , pretzels , beer and ** b ** mw . 
  face it , you are german and germans are bavarian . 
   as pole or romanian . 
  it 's incredible that even now they do n't recognize they oppressed for 50 years half a continent . 
  what 's even worse is that in these 50 years , they manipulated with shit ideology an entire generation , basically changing entire cultures forever . 
   heroism there 's nothing heroic in killing , raping and pillaging every innocent they saw in their way to germany . 
  so yeah , ruskies are and will always be in my eyes a nation of invading monkeys that built an empire by feeding from the surrounding nations . 
   who gives a fuck how european countries are viewed by romania , anyway ? 
  and you wonder why the other germans do n't like you guys ... 
   in no way their cars are better than types of `` traditional '' manufacturers . 
  in 2016 , vw sells rcd 510 car cd players with 500 euro without any usb port and crappy `` touch '' screen and lousy resolution . 
  somebody i know was biking with a few dutch in the areas outside of my city where there are a few abrupt hills . 
  apparently , they liked the mountains ... 
  according to them : `` ja , ja , nice mounntains '' . 
  no , i do n't live anywhere close to carpathian mountains . . 
   romania 4.960 ireland 4.936 it seems we are winning ... stay down , little leprechaun !, 
  our beef is with those damn hungarians . 
  you ca n't compare zoe and leaf with tesla 3 . 
  tesla 3 is the only one that actually looks like a car - e.g. 
  has a trunk . 
  not to mention that in case of zoe , you do n't own the batteries and you must also pay 100 eur/month for them . 
  as for the price , in romania , the government offers starting this year a voucher of 6k eur if you buy an full electric car . 
  in your face , ireland !, 
  i saw an article about a french guy who moved to romania and modified a dacia logan to be full electric . 
  aparently , the modifications costs around 10k eur and the car , since it 's from 2005 , less that 2-3k euro . 
  link in romanian : http://www.auto-bild.ro/teste/test-dacia-logan-electric-aparente-inselatoare-15-euro-pentru-100-de-kilometri-81775.html so , in theory , an average pole or estonian could afford a dacia electric . 
  if they are above 40 , there are extremely slim changes they 'll understand something . 
  as for younger population , they might understand a few words here and there or even understand what you 're saying , but they probably wo n't be able to make complete sentences . 
  personally , i still struggle with writing - it does n't sound very natural to me . 
  that 's why i 'm trying to interact and have actual conversations with people on / r/europe as much as possible . 
  sounds funny . 
  care to give a few examples of the norwegian-english ? 
   vlad dracula ( 1428/1431 -- 1476/77 ) , vlad lived in the 15th century . 
  that gym looks exactly like my highschool gym 6-7 years ago . 
  i agree . 
  but even if they had it , i 'm pretty sure they would n't returned it - they stole and pillage fair and square . 
  they are like beavers . 
  i bet the kids play with construction materials in kindergarten . 
  i do n't think it 's only one factor . 
  it 's about education ( or lack of it ) , communism , the '90s when it was a lawless country . 
  they do n't understand that a lot of things have changed since then - alternative communication channels , social media , etc. 
  sure , they started to pay online propaganda trolls . 
   polenta it 's called mamaliga and you know it !, 
  i think we also eat in the winter `` mamaliga cu branza '' ( polenta with cheese ) . 
  yey , first place !, 
  and also smokes weed , yeah , [ raggae dog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3yttkzf344 ) !, 
  hmm ... 
  it does n't look similar to me . 
  and for that price you not even own the battery - it 's a lease of 100 eur or more a month . 
  no thank you , i 'm waiting for the germans to sell used tesla 3 's in 7-8 years . 
  :d plus , it also looks like a toy or a bigger kart ... 
  oh ... then , my bad . 
  the pluming thing was uncalled-for ... 
  the `` 80 % of all employees '' is false and it 's not even in the article . 
  from what i remember is ** around 44 % ** . 
  however , 75 % earn under 380eur after taxes - plus , a portion of that might earn more under the table from their employer . 
  says the car thief with pluming skills . ^ i 'm ^ joking ^ . . not . 
   but rest assured it will come to your country aswell . 
  highly doubt that . 
  well , at least it 's not the gay vampire dude ... 
  i was expecting something fluffy and pink ... 
  the article was mentioned in mediafax.ro , a known romanian news agency several hours ago . 
  i do n't know what 's more retarded , comparing romania with turkey or the fact that the skynews reporter is innocent or dan adamescu is a political victim ... 
  i 'm simply speechless about this guy 's stupidity/maliciousness ... 
  since when the eastern bloc is represented by v4 ? 
  it 's funny to put us in the same basket with hungary considering their prime minister is a nationalist moron that makes inappropriate comments about my country . 
  it seems fake , 7 % is really too high ... 
  lower taxes - our vat was reduced to 20 % from 24 % and an minimum wage increase . 
  also , for some reason , every store in my city no matter how small and shady it seems gives receipts . 
  turkey ( gru-gru-gru ) , actually . 
  but yeah , it 's a stupid idea to give ultimatums to your biggest and powerful ally . 
  no wonder everybody hates the dutch . 
  or we could 've turned like turkey instead .
