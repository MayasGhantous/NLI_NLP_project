   romania was under communist rule because it joined the axis and attacked the soviet union . 
  after the soviet union ( lowercase letters on purpose ) annexed a part of our territory . 
  drupa by any chance ? 
  sure , it does n't matter that their entire market is dominated by western companies that move their money out of their country . 
  how retarded can someone be in order to burn the place they live in ? 
  wtf they want to achieve by destroying buildings intended to help them for free ? 
  schengen membership applications can be vetoed by another state . 
  bulgaria and ro are in eu for ~ 9 years and we are not in schengen because each time a different country opposed it . 
  turkey is not even in eu ; even if it joins eu - and they will not in the foreseeable future , they border a lot of unsafe countries , unlike us and the bulgarians . 
  really , polish vampires !? 
  pompires !, 
   our people are mixed with thousand of nation 's bloodline that 's because you 've kidnapped children and women and brainwashed them . 
  i do n't have any issues with turkish people but i have a problem with people that romanticize hundreds years of oppression and exploitation . 
   some sun hehehe , have you been in bucharest in the summer ? 
  at 38-39 \u00b0 c you guys will have daily heatstrokes . 
  not to mention that because of the pavement , the temperature felt is a lot higher . 
  oh , and it almost does n't rain in the summer . 
  why bucharest and not other city ( cluj , sibiu , oradea , etc ) ? 
  to be fair , i do n't think the last two are also not from ro . 
  i think it 's salina turda . 
  what 's wrong with being called a plumber ? 
  it 's better than what they call us . 
  in your backyard , they all moved there . 
  nope , psd is composed mostly by corrupt communist relics and a new generation of shameless hyprocrite assholes . 
  corruption of course, 
   maschinenl\u00e4rmschutzverordnung  rasenm\u00e4herverordnung come on , are you telling me that you are able to read these words ?!, 
  i 'm not even able to spell the letters out loud . 
   sorry to disappoint you . 
  why should i be disappointed ? 
  if the french people think that immigrants with very conservative religious backgrounds are ok , who am i to be against it ? 
  sorry , i had the impression it was posted in / r/europe : https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/4ag2hr/study_finds_25_of_french_teenagers_are_muslims/, 
  was n't there a study on / r/europe in which it was said that 25 % of french teenagers are muslim ? 
  who does n't like bread and polenta ( mamaliga ) ? 
  heck , we even eat mashed potatoes with bread . 
  was the visit from november last year ? 
  after the bucharest night club fire , the polish president was the first ( only ? ), 
  foreign head of state to visit romania because of it . 
  i personally thought it was a nice gesture . 
  do you live in a village or some isolated location ? 
  i think you misread it . 
  the 30 % was the bribe to the hospital directors that ordered products from that company . 
  these fuckfaces sold disinfectants that were useless , even contained more bacteria , and contaminated their tools . 
  that 's because we make more money than you guys . 
  your baptize does n't affect your life right now in any way . 
  it was a bath when you were a toddler . 
  are there that many ( or any ) women in bulgaria that wear that ninja outfit ? 
  in ro i only saw at the mall some women wearing the hijab ( also , not black ) . 
  which is the romanian company that offers the best internet plans . 
  better hope they do n't start calling you beaver people . 
  except for your passport did you need other papers or arrangements to enter ukraine ? 
  they have but it 's not recognized by nobody except by the ruskies . 
  so their currency is basically painted paper outside of their `` country '' . 
  and how 's that bullying ? 
  why would eu protect the product of a country that is not in eu ? 
  if it should , why uk and not korea , china , or russia ? 
  are their parents also 15yo ? 
  somebody indoctrinated her , made her wear that ninja outfit , that 's for sure , and most likely are her parents . 
  this is how swedish girls look like now ? 
  damn you sweden , you 've ruined blondes . 
   but what do their secular lifestyles give instead ? 
  the only thing it has creatd is a failed and destroyed society with confused teenagers , that are striving the whole time after reaching the high and unrealistic ideals that never give happiness . 
  what tolerant is she when it comes to other people . 
  if she does n't like the host culture her family should return in the me where she would be sold for a goat . 
  she 's as swedish as i am , considering she moved there 8 years ago . 
  the goulash technique . 
  we have the same joke but about dacians . 
  [ not really . 
  to be fair , it 's kinda funny ... 
  apparently reddit has an api with which you can retrieve the last x threads of an subreddit . 
  based on that , you can count the country names in the title and generate an image from an empty template with the continent . 
  but it will be even cooler if you have a simple page with a svg that will be updated without refreshing ( websockets and a cron job that triggers a script that will count the countries again ) . 
  and you guys used to sell them . 
  and they will not leave anytime soon , just ask moldova ... 
  that 's pretty low . 
  i had the impression they are higher in netherlands . 
  yeah , but they probably built a new datacenter for it , training for the employees also costs ; not to mention that the company that customized the template should also have to make a profit ... 
  before or after taxes ? 
  yet another site built with wordpress , woocommerce and an 59 $ theme framework that also happens to have xmlrpc enabled . 
  in case you guys did n't know , this feature can be used for a nasty bruteforce attack , and from what i know , has n't been fixed yet . 
  i 'm curios how much money have they spent for it . 
  i do n't think poles like a `` boris '' to invest in their country again ... 
  are things that bad in spain even for high skilled workers ( e.g. 
  software developers , engineers , doctors ) ? 
  it 's probably the only thing we are good at , at least for the next few years . 
  just let us brag a bit , it 's the only good thing we have . 
  then move to romania . 
  cheap internet speeds and relaxed piracy laws . 
  that 's how internet heaven looks like . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i personally have the 300mbps plan ; the price it 's almost the same , i just do n't need higher speeds . 
  i think the isp even offers to upgrade me to 500 for free , but i do n't remember what were the conditions for the deal . 
  i 've added 1250 - the minimum wage salary from romania ( 1250 ron ) in order to determine what country has higher taxes on income . 
  after the taxes from romania , it 's ** 917 ** and after the taxes in greece , it 's ** 957 ** . 
  i know you guys have progressive income taxes and we do n't , but ~ 40 % of our employees with the minimum wage have bigger taxes than you guys . 
   edit : about 3,5 euros for 100mbit \\ s unlim per month ours is better , 1gbps for 10 euro . 
  and also not slavic ... 
  why did they do it ? 
   also , no problem , mate . 
  `` portugalia '' is probably how you say `` portugal '' there in eesti , no ? 
  it 's `` portugalia '' for us too .
