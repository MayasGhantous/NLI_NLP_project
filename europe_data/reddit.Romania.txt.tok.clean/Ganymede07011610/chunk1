western europe never ceases to amaze . 
  i expected this from you . 
  edit : yea , downvote me , i 'm not the one living in a sick , decadent society . 
  1.7 % , because germany imposes austerity ... 2 % starting 2017 hopefully more after that, 
  this whole thing is going to build up until russia collapses , again ... : (, 
  do n't worry , the us can not afford to have 2 nato members fighting each other , even for 2-4 weeks . 
  as always ( since the war in the balkans , georgia and ukraine ) the eu will be incapable of handling the situation itself and the us will bring 1 or 2 carrier battle-groups in the mediterranean and maintain order ( china would like that ; it 'll get more breathing room in the south china sea which is probably why they switched from buying oil from saudi arabia to russia lately ) . 
  but i ca n't imagine what will happen in the middle east . 
  i 've watched george friedman talk about a turkish incursion into syria if not as far as iraq but i have doubts because i have no idea what the actual relation between turkey , kurds and us is . 
  edit : recent speech by erdogan shows that the us is working rather closely with the kurds and of course turkey is worried about the idea of a kurdish state emerging since a vast area and large population of eastern turkey is actually kurdish . 
  i do expect putin to play this situation brilliantly though . 
  i invite everyone to open google maps for a moment and assume the following : 1 . 
  germany is eventually going to have its ' fill of people it can handle . 
  borders are going to close in a panic from germany , austria , slovenia , croatia , serbia , macedonia and finally greece . 
  it is impossible for greece to manage it 's eastern border because it 's nothing but islands , everywhere . 
  greece can not handle millions of people but they 're going to keep coming until eventually greece brings its ' navy about , seizes all the boats and finally , breaking international law proceeds to dump them back onto turkish soil . 
  turkey screams that it 's territorial sovereignty is violated ; one of them shoots first . 
  turkey and greece have a navy / air skirmish building up to a serious confrontation . 
  if you look at their equipment , they are quite evently matched . 
  on land turkey would dismiss with greece rather quickly but in the east putin is going to make sure turkey ca n't commit to a western front . 
  shit escalates until the us intervenes to calm everyone the fuck down . 
  edit : putin gets a conflict between 2 nato members which is awesome for him . 
  so , do n't expect russia to ease the bombing in syria , in fact it might try to destabilize other regions too . 
  while at the same time militarizing the black sea and possibly increasing its ' actions in ukraine . 
  but obviously it 's not going to commit to an attack on a nato member . 
  edit2 : all these conflicts decrease energy security in the region , prevent romanian investment into gas fields in the black sea or any pipelines from azerbaijan . 
  let 's see if i 'm right . 
  not much at the moment ; we 're rather meek and little . 
  it 's content which is part of the current geopolitical context ... ok that 's enough out of you . 
  have a good day . 
  content completely related to merkel ... she went to turkey personally to meet with the pm just the other day . 
  are you really trying to imply that this is tusk / eu and not merkel / germany currently negotiating this ? 
  come ooooon ... 
  you say that as if tusk had any real power over anything ... 
  this is russia , turkey and the eu . 
  that 's all that matters . 
  and we 're always the pussies everyone coerces into money , into taking immigrants into ignoring that they just annexed crimea , into ignoring the totalitarian shifts in turkey . 
  : d when did we become the pussies ? 
  why ca n't we have a balance between being the ruthless monsters we were not long ago and having enough toughness to impose our interests , at least in our own back yard . 
  precisely why we have politicians who are meant to curb it to the benefit of the people : d, 
  [ how does it feel to be at the mercy of a financially broken russia and an increasingly totalitarian turkey ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aozquda.png ) make * europe * great again , america is already pretty damn awesome ... can we dispel with this notion that merkel knows what she 's doing ? 
  she has no idea what she 's doing . 
  * `` sure '' *, 
  that makes sense . 
  if it 's so much better in poland why do n't french and germans move to live and work in polish factories ? 
  no , but if you are a doctor in poland ... and the worse thing is that helathcare is public so the polish tax payer is competing for healthcare staff with the swiss or norwegian tax payer . 
  it 's not reasonable . 
  those jobs are limited . 
  we 're talking about the country-wide average wage here . 
  the ones that drive votes and politics . 
  i have a friend who is a multi-millionaire with whom i keep in touch sporadically and he just told me he is moving from london to prague because london is too expensive . 
  anecdotal but ... still . 
  i do n't think that anyone in the east wants exactly the same wages as in france , uk or germany . 
  but , 1500 / month would be nice so that our young people do n't move away anymore . 
  more similar cultures and languages between ukraine and poland and romania still has moldova . 
  i do n't know about hungary and slovakia . 
  edit : oh and higher wages in poland , of course . 
  honestly i 'm not so sure anymore . 
  i think in the face of automation , regions with lower population densities are going to fare better . 
  consider the new 2.5 bln range rover investment in slovakia ... a massive factory is only going to provide direct employment for 2500 people ? 
  that 's insane already . 
  i think having a legal immigration policy where we bring in the people we need on the positions we need is going to be far more beneficial in the long-term than what germany or sweden are doing for example . 
  we wo n't get russian workers while we 're still hostile to them and they to us ; the only way that can change is if russia has another economic collapse and we reach out to them in support , which i think we will . 
  poland and romania have reached out to ukraine despite old animosities , we 'll do the same to russia if it falls . 
   that ' ll help immensly in attracting new ( western ) investors and industry ;-) right , i 'm saying that the czech republic has plateaued on possible wage and economy growth coming from `` globalized economy '' and foreign investment . 
  same as ... south-eastern china ; the wages would be getting too high in comparison with other countries in the world so investors are just going to look somewhere else . 
   sometimes i wonder if you ever understood only the most basic mechanics of a globalized economy ... 
  it 's precisely because i understand the limits that i only see 2 options . 
  either the eu implements a serious program of reducing income inequality and stops considering the east as a worker market good for exploitation , or we 're going to return to nationalism ( [ or regionalism in this case ] ( http://predsjednica.hr/files/newsletter%20views%20and%20news_no%202.pdf ) )  at 4.5 % unemployment the union 's leverage to raise wages should be pretty huge ... not when the entire factory is set up to produce just 1 part for 1 client ; management will just say : `` this is what the parent company is offering , take it or leave it '' . 
  i 've written this before , you ca n't sell a bmw gearbox to ford . 
  the factories are only subsidiaries . 
  with 4.5 % unemployment , more foreign investment to compete against the existing factories , is n't coming . 
  nobody is going to invest millions or billions of euros in a factory where there are no workers , only to compete and try to steal workers from other factories . 
  take the case of vw and skoda for example ; skoda is the low-cost alternative to vw , so in order for the car to remain low-cost wages need to be remain low . 
  same with dacia and renault . 
  neither vw nor renault will want to bring the low-cost brands to the same level as the parent companies . 
  that 's nonsensical from a marketing perspective . 
  edit : beyond this point gdp and wage growth can only come , either from a eu mechanism or from within . 
  take your pick . 
  :p edit2 : 1 . 
  being inside the eu means the romanian government ca n't stop the massive influx of 2nd hand cars from the west , to increase the number of dacias that romanians are buying . 
  without raising local consumption of dacia ( renault ) have no interest in raising wages above the current level ( 400 euro / month ) because they need the car to be as cheap as possible in order to sell it . 
  every time the unions at dacia attempt negotiations to raise the wages renault just threatens to increase / move production to morocco . 
  ** fucking globalized economy ** and exploitation and of course the eu has no interest to change anything , renault would like to grow local sales , but it 's against basic eu treaties and principles . 
  solution =  regionalism / nationalism ( or a eu mechanism , but there is no political will ) and an end to the free market . 
  why do you think sanders and trump are winning in the us ? 
  the bulldozers are in the east , read the last paragraph again :p, 
  only problem with that is * we 're not rich * ; we ca n't afford the cost of waiting 3-4 years and spending billions of euros on trying to integrate and assimilate them . 
  ukraine is a much better source of workers ; do n't worry . 
  edit : and actually russia too , with a population of 145 million people . 
  edit2 : and the czechs have a good experience with integrating vietnamese immigrants . 
  i 'm sure they 'll look at that market again since ukrainians will mostly go to poland while russia is still hostile . 
  edit3 : spelling, 
  [ ** edit with proof of what i 'm talking about ** ] ( http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i32kaekbnv74/v1/-1x-1.jpg ) although i do n't know where bloomberg get 's it data from because [ wikipedia q2 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) says net average wage in the czech republic is 754 euros . 
  ____ with moldova , ukraine and russia right next door i think we 'll be fine for quite some time . 
  [ the real problem is that even with 4.5 % unemployment , wages in the czech republic are n't even close to portuguese levels , let alone spanish levels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) and it 's not as if the exports of the czech republic are any worse than that of spain . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/czexport2013.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/2012_spain_products_export_treemap.png so , i 'll ask again , is there not a push by western corporations ( who obviously control eu and western politicians ) interested in keeping wages down in the east ? 
  both to get workers to move to the west and to produce cheap parts with the workers who stay behind while the added value of the final product stays in the west ? 
  i think so .
