  we do n't even have highways built yet . 
  not even a single highway crossing the mountains and connecting the country . 
  not 1 . 
  take a look at what we have , on google maps . 
  then come back and tell me if it 's fair for us to pay billions on welfare for economic immigrants . 
   the eu is about mutual benefit that 's true , so lets keep it that way . 
  you opened your borders to us in 2007 , after negotiations in 2005 and 2006 and a long process before that . 
  in 2007 at the height of prosperity and economical growth when all of western europe needed workers ... please lets not pretend we joined the eu out of the kindness of your hearts . 
   or receive some benefits because they do n't earn enough to provide for their family . 
  how lucky for them that you now imported a million new people willing to work for a lot less !, 
  : d i 'm sure that if you now cut those benefits too , their lives will improve drastically . 
  we will not become a rich country by importing masses of people who can barely read / write and hold no qualification . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  on the contrary we will become rich by imposing rules and regulations to importing the most qualified workers we can . 
  and we are not a country that can spend billions of euros on educating and integrating hundred of thousands of immigrants who lack qualifications , years before they actually contribute into the workforce . 
  we simply do n't have that kind of money . 
   being successful on a global market always means a mixture of civilizations . 
  ** japan ** , ** south korea ** ... most homogeneous countries in the world , what on earth are you talking about ? 
  moreover , what you say is nonsensical because there is not a single country in the world which rose out of poverty by being anti-nationalistic , by hating its ' own people and the people not buying the very products they produce . 
  every single country in the world which made anything of itself , did so by first being nationalistic and greedy and protecting its ' citizens , workforce , intellect and products . 
   the last 3 companies i worked for i did 30 % of conversations/meetings/presentations in english . 
  i work with probably 25 different nationalities - not only europeans , i like having a turkish grocery shop , an afghan restaurant , a arab hairdresser - it 's normal . 
  it 's not normal in japan or south korea or poland . 
  you know what is normal in these countries ? 
  ** safety ** . 
   in poland , 1.4 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months ,  in korea , almost 2.1 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months  in japan , almost 1.4 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months , by contrast in societies with un-assimilated immigrants imported from regions with a backward religion :  in belgium , 6.6 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months ,  in france , about 5.0 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months  in sweden , 5.1 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months [ source ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ )  it will become normal too in east europe ... maybe just later . 
  it will not ... you can not imagine how much opposition there is here , particularly against muslim immigration . 
  sure , we 'll get immigrants , from china , thailand , laos , maybe christian africa , etc. . . 
  but we have no indention of committing slow cultural suicide . 
  ah , that sounds fair . 
  ok then ; good to know . 
  let me ask you something and please answer with honesty ; do you think eu expansion in the east was / is a failure because we refuse to take in immigrants ? 
   worked here for a certain amount of time ( i think 12 months ) actually that already sounds discriminatory and problematic for seasonal workers : ( like i said above , if they work for 7-9 months / year in germany , perhaps jumping from job to job , picking cucumbers one month , and tomatoes the next , and they pay taxes there and create added value in the german economy , it 's rather unfair to force them to move back to romania during winter , and claim benefits in a country where they 're not paying taxes . 
  that means those money are coming out of my taxes and the taxes they pay there go to you ... that 's not acceptable . 
  how 's it going today ? 
  you 're off topic . 
  your post is still anecdotal . 
  if everyone does it , you should have said everyone , and not , * whites * . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahky6hxokzi i wo n't say for sure , but i imagine that these workers apply for some form of welfare when there is n't any seasonal work to be done . 
  and if you want to claim that seasonal work is just seasonal and that they should be sent back to romania when they 're in-between jobs , then that 's actually not in accordance with eu treaties and completely against the principle of free movement of people . 
  if your new law makes a distinction , i might tolerate it if it 's fair ( it 's ok to stop abuse ) ; otherwise , i definitely will not ; ** they 're not slaves to be borrowed for a few months ** , work and pay taxes in germany and then have to come back and apply for welfare from the romanian state during winter months . 
  all while you ultimately flood our market with the very produce they create for german businesses . 
  that would be ludicrous . 
  edit : some words and also , i 'm going to email our prime-minister and president about this issue asking for a report with regard to who the people affected would be in the context of your new law . 
  that 's however much compensation for being in a free-trade zone with a country like germany who buys almost nothing but raw resources and exports everything from toothpicks to nuclear generator turbines . 
  that 's racist . 
  if i said that i noticed blacks abusing the welfare system without a source , i 'd probably get my comment removed by mods . 
  so please refrain from posting your anecdotal comment with regard to * whites * . 
  just as eu is not stand-in for compulsory illegal immigrant redistribution . 
  hey , look , we 're in agreement !, 
  agree to disagree . 
  could you link a source please ? 
  it might be the case that german farms are taking romanians and bulgarians there for seasonal work and once it 's over they apply for welfare . 
   pretty weak context if you ask me . 
  no weaker than bringing up eu funds in the context of compulsory illegal immigrant quotas . 
  do n't worry friend , germans are not germany 's `` own '' . 
  and if what you say is the case , then there is no eu , and there are no eu citizens ; remove that flair flag , ** at once ** . 
  i bring up the illegal immigration crisis because what you are doing with one issue can not be treated or though of as done in a vacuum . 
  everything needs to be considered in the wider context . 
  after all , ** the first thing your politicians said when we voted against illegal immigrant quotas was to bring up the fact that eastern nations take the most funds from the eu . 
  ** *** context . 
  that 's right , i 'm a * horrible racist * . 
  but i understand your position too , i mean the very notion of `` caring for your own '' is so alien to germans and westerners it 's borderline comical to watch . 
  please , continue . 
  since you seem to like rules and regulations so much , i hope you 'll respect our vote not to take in any immigrant quotas , when the time comes , as long as it is in line with eu rules and regulations ( we 've got the necessary votes to prevent further redistribution from now on ) . 
  tell me how do you justify following the law so strictly on eu migrants but do n't give a shit when it comes to illegal immigration ? 
  actually , you know what , never mind , just do whatever it is your germans want to do , and we 'll watch from the sidelines . 
  [ these numbers are for your country ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand.htm ) but honestly they ca n't be much more different in germany , right ? 
  how can anyone claim that attacking eu migrants for taking * benefits * , perhaps when they are between jobs or have a small child , is at all rational ? 
  moreover given the very low numbers , how can germany not afford it ? 
  breathtaking hypocrisy from merkel , yet again . 
  edit : actually you know what ? 
  it 's not , because you ca n't have a welfare state and open borders . 
  with 5 billion poor in the world , that is a contradiction in terms at the most basic level . 
  it 's just that , you know , this is a woman who did not flinch in the face of greek drama ( 27 % , 50 % + unemployment among young people ) ; eu migrants and their benefits are emotional peanuts by comparison . 
  besides , most eu migrants are from countries who refuse to take in `` refugees '' so we 're * horrible racists * anyway . 
  which is why not only are we looking at the us as our main ally but also ** coalescing into our final form , [ intermarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) ** . 
  or a mighty * union of poor , poorer and poorest . 
  * so , call it what you will ... 
   why not try syrian doctors ? 
  there 's a joke in there somewhere ... edit : you know what ? 
  fine . 
  i 'll agree to take in all the doctors and nurses who are among the syrian refugees , since you 've already taken so many of ours . 
  do you think merkel will agree to that ? 
  or will she hog them all for germany ? 
  yes , those countries are to blame too , but by the sheer numbers and its ' 80 mln population , germany is the main culprit . 
   oh and again this `` gibs money to us - not refugees '' is again as much disgusting as completely unprobable i 'm sure it seems so to you ... but you know what else is disgusting ? 
  romanian hospitals and the fact the the romanian public healthcare system competes on the same free labor market , for the same doctors as norway , germany , switzerland , austria , etc. . . ** there is no amount of taxes that people working in romania for an average wage of 397 euro / month can pay , in order to get the same doctors and specialists as western and northern europe . 
  ** the only solution to that in fact is small corruption , so when a romanian goes to the doctor , he goes with some money inside an envelop . 
  without this practice the vast majority of what good doctors we still have , would leave . 
  ** and what 's even more disgusting is that you call this * endemic corruption * and you point at it in disgust and you use it as a pretext not to let us join schengen . 
  ** now , which situation is completely * unprobable * ? 
  why do n't you call me a racist for not wanting immigrant quotas some more . 
  edit : i am waiting for a response ; ** please provide one ** . 
  i 'm not saying it 's intentional and merkel is an evil mastermind . 
  i 'm saying that it is not normal for a federal state to have such discrepancies between regions as the eu does . 
  even in the us , the difference between average wages in the riches states and the poorest states is just between 50-100 % , at the most . 
  in the eu on the other hand we 've got entire countries of 80 mln people , where the average wage is 6-7 times greater than in countries of 20 mln . 
  i 'm saying , ** fix these problems ** if you want a federal state before you even dream of imposing immigrant quotas , or we 're leaving . 
  edit : the same goes for cutting our eu funding ... the more refugees you take , the more you will cut our funding , and we 'll suddenly have no good reason to stay .
