  cut it , and we 're out . 
  it 's the only thing keeping us from imposing taxes on imports . 
  and since you decided that what industry is here is only going to make specialized parts and you 'll generally be buying raw materials , * door trims for mercedes only * for example , if you reciprocate and impose import taxes , you 'll be raising the end price of your own finished products on the global market . 
  we will eventually have a showdown on this issue , we 're just waiting for poland to build up some courage . 
   this indicator is the value of exports of goods and services divided by the gdp in current prices . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tet00003 ) besides , some countries , like germany import massive amounts of raw materials and export massive amounts of finished products . 
  meaning that what you export has a much greater added value than what poorer countries export ( which is what makes your rich ) ; being in a free market / union with you , condemns already poor and underdeveloped countries to stay poor and underdeveloped since you hog most of the industry you 're mostly only interested in buying raw materials , since you produce absolutely every single thing on the market . 
  from the cheapest to the most expensive . 
  you have moved some of your industry abroad , but even then you pay shit salaries , inside the eu , and the vast majority of factories do n't actually produce finished products but instead produce parts for your finished products . 
  meaning , you decide what you want to pay for them since most of these are very specialized parts , more often than not there 's only 1 buyer for what we produce . 
  for example , you ca n't sell a bmw gearbox to ford ; romanians work in these factories , we 've got ~ 3 % unemployment in transilvania , but wages for these people are still roughly 500 euro after tax . 
  so it 's not as if we do n't produce anything . 
  but , the parent company sets the price for the subsidiary factory . 
  and that 's how you keep us poor , despite the very low unemployment in transilvania . 
  edit : or do you mean that it 's impossible to find 5-8000 romanians to use a robotic arm to hinge a door on a 80 000 euro car all day long for 3000 euro / month ? 
  we might be less educated on average but we 're not that stupid . 
  and actually , that finished door that 's just hinged in germany , is made using skilled but cheap workers in romania , and many more work-hours go into it , than just assembly . 
  but , the parent company is in germany , profits stay there after the car is sold . 
  but , take note , china is slowing down , us is slowing down , big countries in southern europe are in economic depression ( in no small part because you considered that austerity is the solution to the debt crisis ) , opec countries are in financial trouble since the low oil , russia is in deep shit , the uk is about to leave , the nordics are too small as a market ... who 's going to buy so many german products in the coming years ? 
  ... what war ? 
   `` things could fall apart within months , '' which , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble added , `` would be a tragedy . '' no shit , when you 're germany and you export 4-50 % of gdp . 
  they were , in madaras , which is a tiny village outside of ardud ; but the locals overwhelmingly and publicly threatened the public officials with violence and civil unrest , so they gave up on that . 
  if you 're a mayor in a village of a few hundred people , and they 're all horrible racists and nearly all if not every single one signs a petition against relocation of immigrants , what are you gon na do , commit political suicide ? 
  i ca n't find any data , but my bet is that most houses in madaras do n't even have sewers and people still use outhouses . 
  [ and you can tell from the amount of horse dung on this street , that horse + cart is still a means of transport ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@47.6916561,22.844926,3a,75y,203.37h,68.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sx2n_xkoqyvkbt_frycwsea!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  most people who live in madaras probably do seasonal agricultural work in the west , save some money and slowly improve their houses when they get back . 
  ** the eu is a theater of the absurd ** . 
  i mean , [ look , seriously , what are you doing moving economic immigrants to here ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@47.6868219,22.84391,3a,75y,175.33h,78.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szld2phnpqcdxcwhg-erodw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ; did n't they leave turkey to escape poverty ? 
  do n't worry , romania is too pussy to leave by itself anyhow ; it 'll take polish leadership to get things going . 
  and i 'm not talking about romania in the comment above , i 'm talking about the entire eastern block . 
  everything east of germany , austria and italy . 
  and btw , we know you do n't care , after all , [ the dutch are about to betray an entire country ] ( https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/132072 ) after it was the eu that pulled ukraine in the mess it is now . 
  what makes it worse is that the first people to have ever shed their blood on the eu flag are ukrainians , but do the dutch care ? 
  oh and btw , even if dacia is owned by renault and it is a finished product we are exporting , if we stop all the 2nd hand cars coming in , dacia will actually sell more too ; sell locally , but it wo n't take a hit . 
  that is what i 'm saying , but mark my words , the more immigrants/refugees they take , the more they will cut our funding ; so we will have a showdown on this issue , no doubt . 
  there is no way poland is going to take it . 
  the alternative of course is comprised of all the countries east of germany and austria . 
  with whom we can engage in trade on equal footing . 
  being in the same free market as denmark , norway , germany , etc , is hindering our development since we ca n't compete with their productivity . 
  plus , there is the workforce drain , and the braindrain , and so on . 
  eu funds are the only thing compensating for that . 
  besides , most of our exports to western europe are in fact not finished products , because we ca n't compete . 
  our exports are parts made using cheap labor here , which are part of their industries . 
  we can impose a tax on imports , and we 'll be fine , we 'll buy more local produce , but if they try to do the same , they 're only incresing the final cost of their finished products . 
  especially in the auto industry . 
  which only makes their cars less competitive on cost in the end . 
  which is why i say that we 'll reconsider our membership , but in the end we 'll stay in after getting more favorable terms . 
  for example , eu-wide public healthcare comes to mind , since healthcare in the eu is mostly public , romania has to compete on the same labor market , for the same doctors with norway , denmark , uk , etc. . . that 's terribly unfair and no amount of taxes that i can pay or reduction in corruption is going to change that . 
  wonderful that i could provide that for you . 
  but i stand by my statement . 
  after all , membership in a voluntary free market must have benefits for all parties . 
  i 'm not going to comment and offer any opinion on immigration here , now ; but i do want to say something perhaps more important , if the poll turns out to be factual . 
  there can never be any reconcilliation or understanding between the eastern block and western and northern europe ; no consensus . 
  if you push immigration on us , the eu , as it is now , falls appart , if by some means eastern politicians get into power at the level of the eu , and they bring a hardline on immigration , eu will again fall apart because you will protest that it 's inhumane to lock out millions of poor people , while our view will be that we are protecting ourselves . 
  our experience with the ussr who tried to dismantle our identity , the censorship , is too eerie in comparison with what the eu would be doing , should it try to impose immigration here . 
  this is a very sad state of affairs , because there is little chance illegal immigration pressure is going to stop ; and the eu ca n't move forward under these circumstances . 
  moreover , eastern europe is hemorraging workforce and brainpower while you flood our markets eith your products , and the eu funds are the little thing that compensates for that , however much . 
  the more immigrants , or refugees if you insist on calling them that , you take , you will want to spend your money on them , and not send it to us , * the horrible racists * . 
  this also means that we 'll need to reconsider our membership . 
  edit : some words, 
  immigration without assimilation is extremely problematic . 
  screw this western media . 
  it 's not racism , it 's xenophobia ( but more specifically it 's * islamophobia * ; europeans are still not xenophobic to asians for example ) and it 's a natural response of the community against hate and anti-social acts coming from another group of un-assimilated immigrants . 
  i have several asian-european friends who have recently become more xenophobic / islamophobic . 
  while racism is always counter-productive , in this case the emergence of ~ ~ xenophobia ~ ~ islamophobia is beneficial . 
  first by putting a stop to illegal immigration and second by forcing people who are already here to conform and assimilate . 
  we have a problem in that we do n't assimilate people ; instead we let them live in parallel societies . 
  the us used to be a successful immigration country because it assimilated immigrants and , believe it or not , xenophobia played a role in that . 
  everyone points to the fact that the us took in so many immigrants from europe ( irish , italians , etc ) but what they forget to mention is that those immigrants experienced serious xenophobia from the locals too ( just watch old us movies and see what low opinion and xenophobia locals had for irish , polish , italian immigrants ) and with the exception of italians , they were not allowed to flock and settle all in one place , but were rather dispersed and moved around the country . 
  parents and children who experienced xenophobia from the locals , realized that if they wanted to live there , they needed to effectively * become americans * as quickly as possible . 
  we 've lost this and now political correctness makes us unable to assimilate new people ; although , europe was never great at it , not like the us . 
  it is possible that i lack sufficient data . 
  you are correct . 
  but i did not mean the stock-market alone ; i meant the economy as a whole . 
  edit : after all , romania shows -10 % , but economically we 've had a great year . 
  wages are up 10 % year on year . 
  yes , if nicaragua , honduras would become anti-putin they would develop into regional powers , basically overnight . 
  it 's not bullshit if you want a federal europe . 
  look what you ( merkel ) did ; you imposed budget deficit rules on romania ( as a side of austerity measures and prevention across the eu ) and ** now , when gas , cement and steel are all at their lowest levels in decades , we ca n't borrow money to build our infrastructure ** . 
  meanwhile you 're spending your money on illegal immigrants instead of investing in europe . 
  that leaves me very unhappy with how europe is run . 
  and i bet that as a german you had absolutely no idea that this problem existed in romania , and ** that 's ** the problem with europe . 
  edit : and before you write a comment about how you are helping the poor from africa and the middle east , let me just tell you that : 1 . 
  we have regions in europe which are comparably as poor as africa if not more-so . 
  there are billions of poor all across the world and every single german would go bankrupt 10 times over before you could even begin to provide prosperity to the entire world . 
  moreover , the only way to help people who have 10-12 children is to first donate condoms and contraceptives . 
  but talking about such a thing in germany would be `` racist '' , of course . 
  meanwhile we have very poor regions in europe where birthrates are 1.3 , 1.4 ... those are regions where development and investments can be sustainable . 
  so how about you invest in europe first ? 
   you realize that most of polish debt is in euro and dollars right ? 
  and handling debt is already significant part of the budget . 
  which is why i said that there is a sweet-spot . 
  i do n't know where that is for poland . 
   nevertheless it 's market is performing worse then its neighbors . 
  even so it 's performing much better than any western nation . 
  i ca n't comment about the other policies because i do n't hold sufficient information to form an opinion . 
  i do n't know to be honest ... 
  i think france showed that you ca n't fix declining population / workforce with un-assimilated immigrants . 
  germany , probably made the same mistake . 
  i want to say that even a bad policy is better than no policy , but , the truth is that poland does have a good source of immigrants and workforce , in ukraine .
