  so , i do n't know . 
   germany companies expanded to eastern europe and not to the expensive countries in the south . 
  they did ; not sufficiently though . 
  plus , i 'm sure people in the south would rather like to be employed , even for less money , than not have any career or any income for the foreseeable future . 
  merkel got used to shifting sheer economical magnitude to get her way at the eu level , instead of pushing forward with a directly elected president , a unification of political parties and elections at the level of the union , not national elections for seats in the eu parliament . 
  that would have meant that southerners and easterners would have voted with politicians who would favor investments in their regions ( and for good reason ) , which would have meant that the north would have lost some jobs . 
  but it 's already got declining populations and a lack of work-force . 
   zloty is about as low as during the peak of 2008 crisis . 
  you realize this actually makes polish products more competitive both on the external and internal market , right ? 
  it 's not a case of whoever has the strongest currency wins ; each country has a different * sweet-spot * for its ' currency which most favors investment and growth . 
   stock market is going down stock markets are going down everywhere as a response to what 's going on in china ; it 's not localized to poland . 
   as for mentioned program `` 500 for each kid '' even their own ministry of financed opinionated said act negatively and they still went ahead with that . 
  investing in children is a long-term thing . 
  you wo n't see a return on investment for at least 20-25-30 years . 
  [ poland 's miracle ca n't end because russia is about to become even more aggressive . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_cpg4spkdc ) ergo , the us is going to prop up the polish economy * regardless * of who is in power , as long as they are anti-putin . 
  in the same way the us does n't give a rat 's ass about the incredible corruption and nepotism in south korea . 
  it just needs south korea to be there and be a solid state . 
  another one of * we do n't like the new government so economy crisis looming * type of articles ... [ other people are more concerned about germany ] ( https://youtu.be/i1duh7x76xu?t=3m39s ) if chinese have a crisis and stop buying , if russians have an oil crisis and ca n't buy , if saudis and opec countries ca n't buy , i am indeed worried for german exports . 
  the crisis of 2008 taught us in eastern europe that when western europeans have an economy crisis , they buy more cheap eastern products . 
  that 's part of the reason why poland only slowed down , it never went into recession . 
  moreover , if germany is in an economical crisis , and it can no longer pay eu funds to the rest of us , there 's really no reason for us to stay in the free-trade zone , now is there ? 
  we ca n't compete with german output and efficiency and eu funds are the only thing compensating for that , to some extent . 
  edit : if westerners buy a lot of produce then we might stay anyway , and if we earn more then we can start buying some of your more expensive products ; that 's the only salvation which i see possible for the free-trade zone , if germany can no longer supply eu funds . 
  edit : if we are in an * ever closer union * it makes no sense for all of the industry to be concentrated in the north-west and allow such horrendous income inequality in what we wanted to think of as a * federal state * . 
  so , if germany has a declining population and insufficient work-force it should have moved much more of its ' industry towards the south and east , caring for european citizens and allowing eu democracy to take hold . 
  but instead it chose to use the * pretext * of a refugee crisis to let in 1 million potential workers ( we 'll see if most of them can even get any qualification ) while greeks , spaniards , croatians and italians are jobless and romanians and bulgarians earn peanuts . 
  ** you have n't addressed the main points of my comment ** . 
  you 've only replied to the last sentence . 
  please reply to the main idea behind my comment or admit that i 'm right . 
  on the contrary . 
  my chances go skyhigh if i publicly criticize islam , create silly drawings of their prophet and if i create lyrics such as `` muslims to the lions '' i risk reprisal from my own government , if i live in a western country . 
  the same government that does nothing if i write song lyrics such as `` christians to the lions '' . 
  my life will be threatened if i say islam is shit along with all other religions . 
  that 's the point you do n't seem to get . 
  it 's not about what my chances to be killed are if i sit quietly and do and say nothing while an intolerant ideology suppresses women all around me . 
  stop repeating the same non-sense you hear from idiots . 
  please . 
  i have more reason to fear islam than christianity , based on empirical evidence and statistics . 
  it really is that simple and i 'm not going to pretend it 's not just because i might offend someone . 
  tiny ? 
  lol, 
  there used to be a lot of earthquakes in budapest , during those times . 
  true . 
  i 'm not french either and i have n't read that book . 
  so i 'd rather not comment on it . 
  i 'll check it out though . 
  to be fair it 's probably just because she is in a position of power , able to do more damage . 
  i 'm sure trump would ruin a few international relations with friendly countries in his first few weeks as president :d do n't count him out just yet . 
  i ca n't imagine what christopher hitchens would say if he saw how low we 've sunk ... 
  i am asking if former muslims could create this type of music in france . 
  that 's it . 
  that simple . 
  no more . 
  honestly , after the charlie hebdo attacks the entire country should have printed scandalous drawings of jesus , mohammed and whatever atheists hold dear ... maybe einstein masturbating or something . 
  and poster and plaster them over the entire country . 
  that 's what the france that i 've read about in history books would do . 
  you 're right . 
  so what the fuck was manuel valls talking about ? 
  that fn would take part of the army and fight against the other political parties ? 
  france may devolve and decay into tremendous social unrest but their army should be able to keep things in check in an authoritarian manner . 
  and yet rappers in the us sing about killing white people and police officers . 
  ** i thought france was the bastion of freedom and free speech . 
  ** what happened to you ? 
  oh , you seem so angry . 
  i love it , i love it . 
  i mean other threads * related * to the subject at hand . 
  jesus christ you must really hate me right now . 
  what , dacia ? 
  funds ? 
  what ? 
  we 're in a different thread . 
  civil war is not what you imagine . 
  civil war is french riots + a weak state + an incompetent police force + a very polarized society . 
  there , you 've got the tinder for civil war . 
  a few murders and rapes which the police does nothing about , a few untrue stories or some crappy propaganda , guns , men , and it 's go time . 
  that 's all that 's really needed to have tremendous social unrest to the point where you need to deploy the army . 
  i beg to differ . 
  i think it is a pressing issue that i am not allowed or able to insult islam in the same way that i am able to insult christianity . 
  i think it 's a serious social issue . 
  we could not protect a couple of cartoonists though ... 
   i have cracked your little * islamophobia * shell . 
  do n't worry . 
  i will bring up my arguments in other threads too . 
  so all can see the double standard and that your society has indeed regressed . 
  i can tell from this reply that you 're a little scared yourself . 
  it 's fine . 
  [ ** could former muslims play black metal with songs titles such as muslims to the lions ?

  i 'm sorry , please read again , as i have made a few edits , sorry again . 
  could we accept former muslims who play black metal and have lyrics about destroying islam ? 
  could we give them a socociety free enough to do it ? 
  could we offer them safety ?

  these musicians are not christians , clearly . 
  they are very clearly not making fun of themselves .
