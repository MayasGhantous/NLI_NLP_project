  and perhaps if we want to help muslims reform , we should encourange muslims who play black metal and sing songs about bringing muslims to the lions . 
  ** let them sings their own songs about destroying their religion ** . 
  ** this is europe ** . 
  ** this is the kind of freedom we grew up with for crying out loud ** . 
  but guess what , we are not even supporting muslims who have become atheists and are now criticizing islam . 
  ok , so if i am not able to tell a muslim that i think his religion is idiotic and moronic , when will islam lose it 's sacredness ? 
  are we having a serious conversation or not ? 
  are you acting like a fool now because you 're out of arguments ? 
  [ ** behemoth - christians to the lions ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd03z_6xdis ) [ ** behemoth - anti-christian phenomenon ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wli-vau4ylq ) could we make a song , ** today ** , in western europe that said , in the title , `` muslims to the lions '' ? 
  because we make them about christians ... and nobody loses their shit . 
  i do n't care how bad the music is , they have that right . 
  [ here 's a better song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38j-i8jh7xk ) do you think merkel would ** demand ** that youtube take them down if they were about muslims and islam ?!? 
  i think so . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wf9iq/front_national_win_could_lead_to_civil_war_warns/cxvuhq5 i ask you , ** could musicians in france make music with lyrics about killing muslims ? 
  because apparently they can make music with lyrics about killing christians ** . 
  and they do ( make lyrics :d ) , for whatever reasons they may have . 
  notice that your skin literally crawled up just as you read what i said ? 
  did you feel that cold shiver too ? 
  here 's an example : [ behemoth - christians to the lions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd03z_6xdis ) [ behemoth - antichristian phenomenon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wli-vau4ylq ), 
  that 's right , play down every single major problem ... after all , a falling man only dies when he hits the ground . 
  up to that point , he 's perfectly alive . 
  well that phobia is also justified . 
  let me show you something . 
  [ ** look at the beginning of this video ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7bcrg3cg0 ) these bands are openly anti-christian and they hate and despise christians , specifically in their lyrics ; just read if you do n't believe me ; they have lyrics about killing christians , burning churches , etc. 
  so why is it frowned uppon to be an islamophobe but not a christian-o-phobe ? 
  do we still live in a society open and free enough that we could have bands ( at least with members who are former muslims themselves ) who had similar lyrics against muslims and islam ? 
  ** if not , then we have a serious problem already ** . 
  we have regressed , already . 
  # ** islamophobic ** - what does this word even mean ? 
  *** please do n't downvote the comment above me . 
  please let the conversation below be seen and read . 
  *** if i am an anti-theist and i really hate and despise all religion , i am also an islamophobe . 
  i have to be . 
  it stands to reason . 
  are you saying that i ca n't be an anti-theist , i ca n't speak out loud against religion in france without being discriminated against ; silenced , censored , killed ? 
  i want to be able to tell people that i think their religion is moronic and idiotic . 
  this progress that we 've made towards a secular , rational society , it came through and from criticism ; through and from the freedom to ridicule authority , even the fucking pope , anyone and anything ; all our social and political and scientific progress is for me sacred and ** non-negotiable ** . 
  so i have no problem to fight in a civil war to protect these things if the state can no longer . 
  edit : you know , i ca n't believe that a romanian is lecturing a frenchman on this topic . 
  we 've only been free of communist dictatorship , censorship , politically motivated incarcerations and murders for 25 years . 
  and here i am explaining to you what freedom is . 
  well , that is more accurate . 
  they do n't come ** only ** from romania . 
  it is more likely that things will change , than that they will stay the same . 
  such is history . 
  i 'm not saying it will happen , but far worse things have happened and i 'm sure each and every one , surprised and shocked people who did not thought it possible . 
  consider telling ukrainians that they will have an internal civil war and conflict with russia , a few years ago . 
  they would tell you russians and ukrainians are brothers . 
  and they still call it brotherly war , today . 
  i think he is still under the shock and fright of the 130 dead and he 's been thinking * worst-case * ever since . 
  sorry for editorialization of the title but i do n't think the youtube title is relevant . 
  in any case , i 'm not even sure if this is really related to r/europe , but the scenery and the perspective leaves me breathless . 
  [ particularly at 4:58 ] ( https://youtu.be/eo3v6f-q-b8?t=4m58s ) there is so much beauty spanning the horizon i feel like 2 eyes are n't enough . 
  i ca n't look in all the directions i would like to look . 
  :d so i had to share . 
  edit : i can not wait for content such as this to be released on vr , in 4k . 
  i think they most definitely can if they want to be , with the condition that they must not want to change european values and culture and laws , ultimately . 
  [ i had to search through my post history a little bit , but it definitely feels good . 
  i ** do not ** wish for civil war in france . 
  i hope you all can solve your integration problems peacefully , without the need to vote for fn , but given the situation in france and the political alternatives , i 'm sorry to say that would probably vote for fn . 
  civil war is still a distant prospect and barely a glimmer of worst case scenario imo and only worth mentioning to lunatics on reddit such as myself and to desperate french politicians . 
  what is definitely much more worrying in the short or medium term is the fact that our experience with religiously-unreformed muslim populations in north africa and the middle east is that the only way to keep the peace / civil order is through dictatorship or a heavy hand . 
  things such as , closed ethnic neighborhoods , sharia courts , riots , car burnings , the increasing polarization of french society would mimic the gap between shia and sunni in other places and require a much more * involved * government , to put it lightly . 
  and i think that despite voting for the fn , french people do not want to live in an authoritarian state ; so i feel sorry for them . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wdep6/over_75_of_romanians_say_romania_should_not/cxvpca1 ~ ~ on digi24 they said that so far of hundreds of thousands of refugees not a single one could be convinced to move here . 
  :d ~ ~ actually i ca n't find the source anymore but it would n't surprise me . 
  actually that does n't matter . 
  from what we 've been hearing on the news , of 4700 imposed by the quotas , ** not a single refugee could be convinced to move to romania ** yet , of all the hundreds and thousands of them . 
  and they ca n't be forced . 
  so , joke 's on ~ ~ you ~ ~ merkel . 
  you must be an emigrant who left a long , long time ago . 
  so what ? 
  do n't americans do the same about beating the germans ? 
  or the japanese ? 
  pc for the roma !, 
  at least we 're not as white as ukrainians , the poor bastards . 
  but the odd ones out are the poor roma ; they 're not that white yet pc does n't apply to them . 
  even swedes hate them . 
  they already have . 
  lol french citizens kill 130 in paris after returning from syria through serbia / croatia ? 
  immediately car-search every romanian car entering schengen on the romania/hungary border . 
  this really happened . 
  well yea , but in the previous polling ( just days before ) [ 97 % acknowledge that they heard about the paris attacks ] ( http://www.inscop.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/atentatele-de-la-paris.pdf ) . 
  it 's not as if they were told on the spot and shown pictures of the massacre . 
  i think what resonated with romanians was the fact that romanian press did not shy away from stating that some of the terrorists passed through greece desguised as refugees . 
  can you believe this guy ? 
  you sure tried . 
  jesus christ man . 
  stereotypical ? 
  you mean ungrateful for all the money you think you 've given us for free ? 
  hahahaha unbelievable . 
  ** because it is our legal fucking right and you conditioned our entrance into schengen with a 500 million euro investment into securing our external borders ; which we did and completed in 2011 by paying a german-french company to do it , to make you happy . 
  ** and when it came to it , millions just walked into schengen anyway , and not a single one came through here . 
  you are ** clueless ** . 
  fuuuuuuck this eu man . 
  keep your money . 
  you poor souls . 
  i weep for you . 
  oh , what happened with schengen ? 
  why has the netherlands fucked us repeatedly about it ?
