  jesus f-ing christ , i ca n't even remember all the things wrong with your eu . 
  now you 're victimizing yourself ? 
  it 's a figure of speech that could only come from someone like you . 
  that 's the point . 
   ** i 'm not at all saying you need to get on your knees and worship us , ** oh , how very modest of you ... my god , i never even thought of that as on option . 
  you give me so much freedom master . 
  i 'm so grateful, 
  then none of your affirmations are relevant to me and we have nothing further to talk about .

  actually the documentary says the exact opposite , but nevermind that . 
  [ ** jump to 11:23 ** ] ( https://youtu.be/wxjwmkqkeam?t=11m23s ) so , this documentary is made by a somewhat controversial romanian tv presenter ( think , ancient aliens guy with crazy hair , but with dacians instead of aliens ) although this documentary is spot on . 
  but , i am posting this so you guys can see the crown of king seuthes in bulgaria ( but also all the gold excavated from thracian tombs ; and why you should probably visit bulgaria and romania someday ) . 
  it is an exquisite work of art from 2500 years ago made in gold but there 's no way i can do it justice by describing it in words , so just click the link above to jump to the time in the video . 
  joke 's on you eu commission , we have no industry left . 
  good luck bros !, 
  lol ... so casually put . 
   probably fewer than 100 000 ... ah , what a relief !, 
  that 's just 1.2 a year if it holds !, 
  we should first and foremost help those countries which have their birthrates under control . 
  ukraine comes to mind as it has a lower birthrate than germany i think . 
  the rest we should help with free education and free birth-control . 
  we should most definitely not help them with food ( or at least we should be very careful how we go about doing it ) because that creates the illusion of food and reliance on aid . 
  we should give food and aid to those who use condoms . 
  edit : * yes i said a harsh , heartless thing , but you know it 's true . 
  [ rationality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ), 
  showing your true colors there . 
  such tolerance . 
  but no matter , you 'll come to us for support against russia anyway , even if we 're all filthy , brown beggars . 
  ** renault turned dacia intro a profitable brand for itself , it owns dacia , not for somebody else ** are you thick ? 
  it most certainly did n't do it for romania or for t renault paid 50 million euros for dacia + subcontractors , received over 200 million euros over 10 years ( still looking for a source , that 's the figure i 've heard , but it does n't matter ) in state aid for it while all the profits went to france . 
  oh , it happens everywhere , does it ? 
  well , you would have little knowledge of the fact that at least in natural gas distribution and electrical distribution , western companies have carved up whole areas of romania where they each have a monopoly , by bribing our politicians . 
  i can only buy natural gas from 1 german company . 
  and electricity only from 1 company . 
  today , in 2016 , in europe . 
  western europe companies do n't compete with each other here , instead they have regional monopolies all over romania . 
  ____ another example : renault bought dacia from the romanian state for 50 million euros and it is now ** the most profitable brand in the renault-nissan group ** . 
  yet , renault takes all the profit from romania and moves it to france and then blackmails the romanian state to get money ( for investments , but they 're a private company , the romanian state holds 0 % shares ) , tens of millions and hundreds of millions of europs from the romanian state , to a french , private company , whenever they threaten the state that they will move the production to north africa . 
  these money have been extorted from the romanian state over the past decade and put into the private investment of a profitable private company . 
  and because we 're in the eu , the romanian state can do nothing to stop them from transferring their profits to france . 
  ___ ** these are just 2 examples of the kind of shit they do n't tell you on the news in western europe ** . 
  dacia , 13 million euros from the romanian government this year alone : http://www.zf.ro/auto/dacia-primeste-un-ajutor-de-stat-de-13-milioane-de-euro-14895447 this year they said , give us 16 million euros to buy robots at the plant in order to raise the automation level , or we will move production to north africa . 
  the most profitable brand / factory in the entire renault - nissan groups , does n't have money for investments in it 's own privately held plant in romania , and after it moves all the profits to france , it blackmails the romanian state for money . 
  ** [ the french state , still holds 20 % shares in renault-nissan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renault ) ** as the largest share-holder . 
  owner : agence des participations de l'\u00c9tat ( 19.73 % ) so , in other words , the french government is blackmailing the romanian government . 
  in eu , in 2016 . 
   i agree with the fact that ee has profited from eu more than we have in the last decade that 's quite the statement my friend . 
  [ this really sums it up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ), 
  i would tread lightly ... 
  the criteria should not be gdp per capita . 
  how about salaries instead ? 
  or poverty per capita ? 
  but i already explained why i 'd rather not have any . 
  not if every 1 in 100 is an islamist . 
  if every 1 in 100 is an islamist then lets help them * outside * our borders . 
  i 'll give money for that . 
  reading your post just reinforces the idea that we have a certain solidarity , born out of adversity that westerners just do n't understand . 
  awww, 
  have your grandparents and parents lived under 4-5 decades of communiet dictatorship ? 
  did you grow up in the 90 's in eastern europe having to watch your mother work 12 hour shifts for 70 $ a month ? 
  did you pack bread and boiled pig fat to middle school because that 's all you could afford ? 
   but then do n't be surprised if in the next years you 'll see your ` development money ' be drastically reduced . 
  you 'll make a fine parent someday . 
  unfortunately , we are not your children . 
   have you ever been seriously wronged by a refugee ? 
  you use numbers and statistics and yet you ask that question . 
  to not wsnt refugees because a single refugee has wronged us , is the definition of a stereotype , of irrational behavior . 
  you forget poland has already taken hundreds of thousands of ukrainian workers . 
  do you want my honest opinion ? 
  eastern europe does n't want muslims because of the example ** you ** have set with their integration into your societies . 
  that 's the bottom line . 
  we 're lucky to have that hindsight . 
  you are in a position where you ** must ** live with them , because you ca n't deport your own citizens no matter how badly integrated they are . 
  we are in a position to say no , to all of them because we have almost none . 
  because from this side of europe the argument that they 're not all bad ( which is most definitely true ) does n't work . 
  should we drink a glass of 99 % water and 1 % poison after seeing what happened after you drank it ? 
  make no mistake , ** we need immigration too ** , but unlike you , we have the hindsight and the opportunity to do it right . 
  pre-signed work contracts before visas , family unification only after 1 year of work and no criminal record , a focus on ukraine , moldova , belarus , russia , and east asia , china , thailand , vietnam , etc , etc. . . all good things . 
  but certainly not taking in pre-filtered , imposed refugee quotas . 
  after germany hand-picks the qualified ones for its ' industry , the least capable ones , barely able to read and write in their own language will be sent to the poor periphery . 
  your comment lacks logic my friend . 
  i just accused you of the exact same thing . 
  the butthurt is strong . 
  so , you 're trying to compare me with murderous nazis because you 're upset that the vast majority of people in eastern europe and the majority of people in most if not all other eu states democratically oppose mindless immigration policies . 
  so , to hell with democracy when you disagree with the people ? 
  that 's how merkel ruined europe . 
  i think perhaps you 're the totalitarian one here . 
  that sounds good . 
  we still have lots of forests over here in need of saving . 
  i found the exact poll . 
  http://www.inscop.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/problema-migratiei.pdf if you take a closer look the question you 're referring to is with regard to europe . 
  ** should europe ... ** and it 's 75.6 % no . 
  the question in the title and the 75.8 % result is specifically about eu refugee quotas imposed on romania . 
  another question in the same poll is : would you like the refugees / immigrants to settle down in your city / town ? 
  for which the answer is 81.9 % no . 
  poll conducted between 26th of november and 2nd of december on 1071 people . 
  + / - 3 % astonishingly the number is up from 56 % in september . 
  the recent paris attacks are thought to be the cause of the increase . 
  merkel ruined europe . 
  impressive .
