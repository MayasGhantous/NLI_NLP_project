  they do n't need to do anything more drastic than cursing women , spitting on them and passing around * `` literature '' * for the neighborhood to go to shit . 
  for the fabric of society to go to shit . 
  and really you can only issue fines ( if you can have any proof that it really happened or if the woman presses charges and is ready for a serious legal battle with almost no evidence for a small crime ) for that sort of behavior but it is enough to drastically impact the lives of women . 
  which is exactly what is already going on in sweden . 
  good luck with your * `` then '' * . 
   lol , it will still be 100x better then living in romania . 
  yes , then people will come to live in romania . 
  it 's not * in decades time * , but it will * span decades * . 
  you have no english comprehension ? 
  besides you 're already proving to be so submissive right here ... 
  i doubt sharia police will have trouble against 80 million * germans * ... 
  who are you people ? 
  why are you so submissive to intolerance ? 
  france . 
   ** coming ** decades of decadence , riots , crime and societal decay . 
  * yes , that 's totally the same thing . 
  * you people are hopeless . 
  enjoy your coming decades of decadence , riots , crime and societal decay . 
  and i 'm only being nice to you because i do n't want to get banned again . 
  ** the real police use patrolling in uniforms as a deterrent too ** ** they do n't need to tell a thief not to steal while they are patrolling ** ** it is the imposing presence that does it , same as patrolling men dressed in uniforms and handing out leaflets telling men not to drink and women to cover up will project power **, 
  wearing that as a uniform and ~ ~ walking ~ ~ patrolling in organized groups is not the same thing as fashion police t shirts . 
  think about it . 
  by doing that they are already exerting social pressure . 
  they do n't need to physically harass anyone . 
  fml . 
  isis is not really a side in the conflict . 
  it 's 27 000 idiots waving some black flags . 
   ms. merkel understands that the war in syria represents a different kind of conflict . 
  it pits not just countries and alliances against one another , but ideas -- in particular , three ideas of world order : the authoritarian world order , embodied by syria 's bashar al-assad and his ally vladimir v. putin of russia , who put stability above human rights and democracy ; the liberal world order , represented by western europe and america , which value the reverse ; and the islamic state , which seeks to upend both orders and replace it with a world-spanning caliphate . 
  i stopped reading right here . 
  * no mention of turkey and how it is becoming a fundamentalist dictatorship , bomding kurds and supporting isis . 
  he just picks the good side and the bad side in a single paragraph . 
  what a moronic thing to do . 
  * we 're the good guys , these are the bad guys , hurrah . 
  i 've written an article for nytimes and i get paid . 
  they 're going after eu migrants because they can . 
  going after non-eu migrants is too politically incorrect . 
  wish we could send over some of our own . 
  you 're grasping at straws . 
  for someone who can already read and write properly in another language . 
  certainly . 
  otherwise , where do you even begin ? 
  even the early school books are designed for children who can already speak german , having learned it at home . 
  and since when are reading and writing sufficient to get a job in germany ? 
  that 's just a prerequisite to learning a skill . 
  do you imagine they will not nurture feelings of resentment and possibly hate when those of them who can find any work are cleaning toilets and sweeping streets ? 
  certainly they will feel unfairly discriminated against . 
  ** and what if they 're cleaning toilets and their boss is a woman ? 
  or worse , a jew ? 
  ** we ca n't imagine ever thinking like this , but most of them probably do . 
  even if he holds a phd in middle-eastern studies ( and did n't just * google it * ) , he is still trying to use his specific knowledge to ridicule someone who does n't have the same bit of knowledge . 
  i find this kind of behavior repulsive . 
  could he not have mentioned it in the conversation , in an informative way , without being passive-aggressive ? 
  and one more thing . 
   differences that matter a lot in this case , it does not matter what specific middle-eastern language these people can barely read or write in . 
  that certainly refutes my argument . 
  you are very intelligent . 
  in fact , you 're so intelligent that you 're able to , probably , google some bit of information that someone else does n't know ( or care to know ) and then waste your time attempting to ridicule them . 
  my my , i have certainly been put in my place . 
  it 's a very british one . 
  i never said it 's bad . 
  how 's your reading comprehension ? 
  you need to get accustomed with the fact that in the real world it is possible for people to have unrealistic expectations . 
  ** sometimes you have to say no ** even if you empathize with their plight . 
  it 's a difficult thing to say no when it breaks your heart ; and unfortunately in overly-feminized societies like sweden and germany there are too few women and men who can still do that . 
  just like speaking , reading and writing need to be learned properly at a young age . 
  otherwise any efforts made later on in life are increasingly difficult . 
  if 2/3 of these people can barely read and write in ~ ~ arabic ~ ~ whatever language , how are you going to teach them german ? 
  or teach them anything at all for that matter ? 
  not to mention that we 're talking about a moving target , employment . 
  just when people in developed countries need to adjust to life-long learning to keep their jobs , these people find themselves barely able to read and write . 
  those who can barely read and write belong in a slow-paced , agrarian society and their chances of integrating into a society like germany , are slim at best . 
  germany has acquired 5-600 000 men who will likely never be employable . 
  moreover , ** what 's way worse is that they did not come to germany for safety ** ( which is obvious , as they could have stopped anywhere between turkey and munchen ) , but for its ' wealth , expecting well-paid jobs or hand-outs . 
  their disappointment and frustration will turn into criminal and smuggling gangs . 
  they will victimize themselves thinking they 're being unfairly discriminated against when in fact they never had a chance , but nevertheless , they will eventually hate germany and germans . 
  one way they will get money is by having lots of children ( 4-7 ) , because the german government offers ~ 200euro / month for every child . 
  they will move into low-rent neighborhoods , germans will move away and there they will raise the numerous next generation in an environment deprived of western or german values . 
  tldr ; france all over again . 
  so , have a child and your tax money returns to you ... : d, 
  you can if you increase the deficit . 
  children are a long-term investment . 
  when were these inserted into the constitution ? 
  honestly , they are great as long as you assume that the world economy is always going to be stable . 
  but in a global crysis , such measures threaten your national security because that 's when you need to borrow a lot and burrow quickly . 
  the more you wait ( like waiting on a constitutional referendum ) the more you risk social unrest , unpaid salaries and pensions , etc. 
  but that 's just my personal opinion after the recent 2008 crysis . 
  i could be wrong . 
  because more afluence just means they buy more expensive shit . 
  then why are n't the germans reproducing ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
  your country needs to become a strong leader in the region , quickly . 
  because if the uk leaves the eu , and fn ( kremlin sponsored ) wins in france , and if bernie sanders wins in the us ( and us policy turns inwards ) , there will be nothing holding back german-russian interests and we 'll be all alone here between 2 monsters . 
  one economical and the other a military power with grandious dreams . 
  you have far more potential for growth than what the eu allows in deficit . 
  lets stop assuming that the people who de-facto rule the eu , also know what 's best . 
  that is clearly not the case with merkel . 
  populism , mind-less spending and corruption , sure , but not investments , education and decent long-term policies . 
  very interesting read . 
  i hope they succeed because poland needs higher deficit .
