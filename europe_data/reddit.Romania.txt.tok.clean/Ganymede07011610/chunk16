  applying the same type of fiscal constraints to two countries as different as poland and greece is an idiocy of which only merkel is capable of . 
  the 100euro / month for ever 2nd and 3rd child is a pretty good idea . 
  although , i would also give more favorable retirement conditions to women with 2-3-4 children . 
  ah , so good of merkel to re-invite turkey into eu ascension . 
  could we please get erdogan to say this to her face ? 
  ** i am a simple-minded man and you ca n't trick or fool me in perpetuity using political terminology and doctrine . 
  have you taken action to address my concerns or have you not ? 
  ** can i see the results of your actions around me , or can i not ? 
  everything else is doctrinal bullshit . 
  france , 10-15 years , civil war . 
  mark my words . 
   it 's fine , we 'll talk after the elections are actually complete . 
  if you 're still around . 
  ** it does n't matter if the fn does n't win ; the fact that all other political parties need to form a common front against fn just to keep them out , is not how democracy should be . 
  ** it is a sign of societal sickness which you deny because it 's too scary to admit its ' existence . 
  it 's the kind of polarization which leads to , and is in fact the precursor to civil war . 
  i am going to stop answering you since i think you might be delusional . 
   * 30 % in the first round of regional elections 30 % is is 30 % regardless . 
  30 % of french people voted fn . 
  do i need to write it even more ? 
   either way , i see no reason to care about that statistic . 
  people vote whatever they want to vote for , and so far that is nowhere close to being able to score an actual election win . 
  then why do we suddently * need to fight for the eu * ? 
   i believe in representative democracy . 
  first of all i do n't care what you believe , you are not someone of consequence and your vote is equal to mine . 
  and secondly , well secondly , because of the attitude of people like you , the majority will start voting far-right which will destroy the eu . 
  you can go ahead and remove that flag now . 
  what i see is 30 % vote for fn in france . 
  do you want to have a eu-wide referendum on immigration or do you want to continue burying your head in the sand ? 
  that is democracy ; ** let democracy happen ** or you are in fact , totalitarian . 
  if people like you do n't understand that you are in the minority , then people like me will start voting parties like fn , because main political parties leave us no choice . 
  you , leave me no choice . 
  there is a limit ; enough is enough . 
  i was just about to say the same thing . 
  if the majority of europeans are now against more immigration , that 's democracy . 
  i think he means * fight * against the far-right , but he refuses to acknowledge the reasons why people vote for the far-right parties to begin with . 
  one way to save the eu is for mainstream parties to recognize the complete failure of non-eu ( but some eu too , eg roma beggars ) immigration and integration policies and put an stop to it at least until they figure out a way to make integration work . 
  otherwise they can kiss their political union goodbye . 
  i want no part in it and i do n't dare judge the french for voting fn ; not when considering the increase in crime-rates they are experiencing . 
  i 've come to hear french people talk about gun-violence and murder among criminal gangs , * settling scores * , as a mundane occurrence and the only times it comes as a surprise is when it 's a terrorist act . 
  things which are almost completely unheard of in a much poorer country like romania . 
  romanian version : http://openbudget.ro/project/2016/, 
  pretty much . 
  another way for putin to cut the gas only to poland and ukraine but not to germany . 
  they should not be here to begin with . 
  helping them here is far more expensive than helping them where they were . 
  you allow such income inequality in the eu that working on the black market in germany is far better than working legally in eastern slovakia or eastern poland . 
  and i am not even mentioning romania and bulgaria . 
  before germans start shouting that czechs should prevent them from leaving , keep in mind that the only way of doing that , is the end of schengen . 
  i 'd rather be in a v28 than a e28 after recent events . 
  hungarians are already deep inside romania : ), 
  1/32 on mothers ' side , 1/16 on fathers side so he 's basically a pole . 
  it 's ok , we can be their new gas dealer and perhaps even export to v4 too . 
  serbia will always have a thing for russia though . 
  i have been thinking about russia lately , and after listening to what our presidents had to say at the recent summit in bucharest , i think we need to have a hard-line on russia and it 's imperialistic ambitions , but also leave sufficient room for dialogue as long as they behave according to international law . 
  i do n't wish or want russia to be a permanent bad guy . 
  edit : and , after recent events , i believe romania is going to become the new anti-corruption model in the region . 
  economically , we 're about 5 years behind you but we might make up a year or two by returning to 5-6 % / year growth . 
  things are looking really good from over here . 
  i think it 's really important for both poland and romania to see a lot of our people working abroad , return home . 
  v7 , we 're good friends with bulgaria and serbia . 
  can romania join ? 
  it 's no more anti-hungarian than the hungarian ultra-nationalists are anti-romanian and this is not really news-worthy . 
  not at all . 
  there is no pro-russia anything in romania . 
  that 's because we already got what we asked for yesterday . 
  now most people do n't have new demands . 
  i guarantee there are many hungarians among them too . 
  i 'm only using digi24 numbers now . 
  why ca n't you just let me enjoy some good news about my country ? 
  yea , multiply that times a couple of years of intense activity , about 7 , and you 'll find why we 're building a few new prisons . 
  * proverbs , how do they work ? 
  * trust me , they do . 
  and romania has benefited at the level of nato and regional geopolitics by having such a strong secret service . 
  a good number of them are cyber / it security experts and they 're providing assistance to ukraine for example . 
  they do contribute greatly to the success of the dna . 
   last year the agency successfully prosecuted 24 mayors , five mps , two ex-ministers and a former prime minister , not to mention more than 1,000 other individuals , including judges and prosecutors , with a conviction rate above 90 %, 
  ok , thank you . 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gatestone_institute what makes it a propaganda source ? 
  if germany , sweden and other states fail to integrate them ; if the quality of education , proficiency and the level of social stability and coherence plummets ... well then , eastern europe ** welcomes your industry and those of you who want to move here ** . 
  : ] poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , and more . 
  so they can never learn the language , never integrate , apply their own laws and live in parallel societies .

  * i do n't want to write a boring block of text ( but i might ) , i would like this to be a discussion but in the next paragraph i 'm going to say something which will suddenly make sense . 
  * ** eu leadership at this time , can only come from within germany because no outside politician could ever impose anything on an [ economy the size of germany ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germany-trade-surplus-reaches-record-high-in-july-2015-09-08 ) ** . 
  yet , especially at a time like this german leadership of the eu seems to favor german interests and the german people seem to be perfectly fine with merkel imposing their democratic will on others . 
  ** dear german friends , you are all wonderful human beings for offering to help war refugees ; i am not denying that and we should do as much as we humanly can to help . 
  ** unfortunately , offering to take in millions * ( and then trying to impose some on others ) * without a long-term plan to stave off the migration is not a solution ; it 's unsustainable because there are quite literally hundreds of millions of people who would like to move to germany ; or sweden , or norway , or denmark , france , holland , belgium , austria etc i ca n't believe i 'm going to agree with orban , after i have been hating him with a passion because of his nationalistic , anti-democratic and pro-russian views but our immediate message should be , ** please , do n't come ** . 
  that 's the only way we can help the millions which will come anyway and we need german leadership to unify europe under one foreign policy because the only feasible , long-term solution is this : ** a unified eu army ( or nato ) to set up safe-zones and safe-cities in their countries of residence where we can send free food , free construction materials , free machinery and equipment , etc ; ** so that they ** all ** have a chance to rebuild their lives , their houses , their industry and infrastructure , not just the ones who can afford to come or dare risk their lives to reach europe . 
  on the leadership / democratic / fiscal and economical / refugee and immigration problems : 1 . 
  if we had free and open elections across the eu to elect our leaders they would be largely opposed to the idea o taking in so many war refugees because they would be accountable to the entire european continent . 
  right now , because germans are greatly pro-refugee and merkel only answers to them and not at all to the rest of us , and because she can effectively impose the will of the german people on the rest of europe , we are experiencing a paradox . 
  i have long wondered why germany does n't push for a proper federal european union . 
  it could take france by the hand and a few other countries and they could simply say to the rest of us , are you in , or are you out ? 
  the fact of the matter is that going back on the euro currency , going back on the free movement of goods and of people would be so damaging to the economy , none of us have any chance . 
  but what i had not realized before is that the status quo already offers germany the ropes it needs to control the eu . 
  sometimes for the better , sometimes for the worse . 
  this is probably one reason why we need the uk to stay in the eu .
