  germany is opposed to fiscal redistribution but here 's the thing . 
  if you wanted to build the eu , if you wanted to take us in , you need at least 1 of 2 things . 
  ** either you establish fiscal redistribution as a federal state would have , or you relocate more of your industry to other parts of europe . 
  ** what you ca n't do is you ca n't keep the industry , as well as the new workers you get from eastern europe as well as all the wealth they produce . 
  helping refugees in europe is expensive because housing is expensive . 
  once all our possible dwellings are occupied , we can help no more but they will keep coming because our message seems to be that we can help everyone . 
  these funds should be used to push forward the solution i mentioned above . 
  anyway , these are just my humble thoughts on the matter and i 'm sure i 'm wrong in some regards . 
  edit : the way things are now , i just do n't see how we could have accountable politicians at the eu level if germany is so powerful , whoever is accountable to the german people alone is going to rule the eu and use its ' institutions to make it look as if it 's the will of the european people . 
  sometimes they impose good measures , sometimes they do n't . 
  but i ca n't vote merkel out of office ( i 'd probably vote for her actually , i like her , or used to ; actually i probably still do like her ) . 
  any suggestions ? 
  any unicef involvement in this at all ? 
  a place where i can donate specifically for the children ? 
  i 'll keep this clean , brief , logical and hopefully organized .

  although , giving them work-visas helps them way more than a refugee status as they can send money back to ukraine . 
  either way , perhaps it 's not a very strong argument . 
  still , the eu could have done a lot more to help ukrainians imo ; they are very poor , you know that right ?

  i could go on , but , i 'll stop here because it 's already a big block of text . 
  ** imposed , mandatory immigrant/refugee quotas are the final straw . 
  ** because you are acting like the mighty rulers of a federal state when it 's convenient or profitable but in fact you tolerate outrageous income-inequality , you rule un-democratically ( if we had direct elections across the eu the union would be far more conservative ) and you think of us as lesser europeans . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : i feel disillusioned and betrayed and i will now vote for whichever political party advocates that we leave the eu and hopefully seek to form a smaller union with the eastern block . 
  bulgaria ( kiss you cutie ;p ) , moldova ( kiss you too ) , poland ( high-five ) , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , croatia , slovenia , the baltic states and ukraine ( if we manage to snatch her from the claws of the bear ) quick edit : and serbia , macedonia , etc. 
  ** edit after reading some of the comments ** : 1 . 
  i used to be an advocate for more eu ( and german ) leadership and more involvement , even militarily against isis , to re-stabilize the middle-east and north africa and help them live in peace ; to show some muscle to putin and in general to take our place as a regional , positive power . 
  it strikes me as odd that our emotion drives us to help the few refugees and immigrants to can afford to get here because the media influences us with pictures , but we forget how many millions more are in camps in turkey and lebanon , and all the ones left behind in syria ... out of sight , out of mind . 
  with no involvement from romania ( or bulgaria ) schengen ( area & regulation ) is effectively broken by other countries when a few hundred thousand people start walking across the borders as if they were n't there . 
  how well protected from isis and terrorists were we even before this whole thing started ? 
  moreover , when orban changes 180 degrees and demands that every single person crossing registers , fingerprints and all , they riot at the gates , throw rocks and set shit on fire , just 70 of them apply for registration , and orban is painted as the villain . 
  and here 's a really big issue with mandatory quotas . 
  even if eastern european countries were welcoming of however many the eu would want to impose , almost not a single country has ** enough teachers , translators and social workers to work , communicate or translate between the native language and arabic ** . 
  logistically , even if the eu provided all the money , we ca n't integrate so many at a time . 
  since i am not a professional writer , i will keep this as concise as before ; basically i will reduce my entire post to nothing but an enumeration of ( verifiable ) facts , personal thoughts and a few unanswered questions for you to judge yourselves . 
  moreover , since i noticed that we have an ongoing ama with a member of the eu parliament today , i 'd like to grab his attention and show him what has turned a eu federalist into a eu skeptic . 
  hopefully that is something the eu parliament is concerned about . 
  first , the ( still ) relevant bit [ from my previous post . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lfpzp/how_i_went_from_eu_federalist_to_eu_skeptic_in_3/ ) . 
  [ romania is denied schengen membership , yet again this very month , by germany ] ( http://www.agerpres.ro/externe/2015/10/06/franta-si-germania-sunt-tarile-care-au-insistat-ca-romania-sa-nu-adere-la-spatiul-schengen-surse--19-13-14 ) 2 . 
  we lack basic democracy in the eu . 
  powerful countries ( germany , france ) shift their weight around to impose their will at the level of the eu , while , if i am against merkels ' `` refugee '' policy , as a romanian ( or pole , hungarian , slovakian , etc ) i can not vote against her . 
  a politician , indirectly imposes her will in matters which directly affect how my government spends my tax money , and i can not vote against her . 
  ~ ~ ** this , is dictatorship . 
  ** ~ ~ whether you agree with me or not , it is my democratic right to decide one way or another . 
  i consider voting for the far-right to be akin to shooting myself in the foot so instead ** i have been voting with my wallet ** . 
  for the past month , i have gone out of my way to stop buying german , french , swedish or dutch products . 
  instead of the usual ~ 4-600euro / month i was sending to these countries ( because i generally prefer higher quality products , especially foods ) , i have sent all my money to hungary , poland , slovakia , czech republic , or i bought products from romania . 
  i will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and i strongly encourage you to do the same . 
  i am also damn sure my next car will not be made in germany . 
  in the long term , if nothing changes in democratic terms , i will reluctantly vote for the far-right , as much as and ** only ** for as long as it is necessary to break the eu , and then go back to voting mainstream . 
  as a former eu federalist , this pains me , but i see no other way out . 
  [ the immigrants / refugees the eu ( merkel ) will impose on romania will receive more money per month , as welfare , than 1 million romanian workers earn working for minimum wage ( 200 euro / month ) ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/social/imigrantii-care-ajung-in-romania-vor-primi-bani-mai-multi-sumele-cresc-si-de-zece-ori-14841331 ) . 
  the income inequality tolerated in the eu is appaling and since as westerners you will never agree to fiscal redistribution ( but you will impose immigrants and whatever else ) , ** we , easterners , need to put an end to the eu ** . 
  make no mistake , the only thing holding together the social fabric , peace , safety , stability and prosperity of a country , is the collective belief of the general population that they live and prosper in such a country or city , regardless of ethnicity or religious denomination . 
  a sense of belonging and shared destiny is crucial for living together in a multi-cultural society . 
  i will point to the hungarians , romanians and roma , living and working together for their own prosperity in transylvania . 
  merkels desperate and pathetic pivot to turkey , with grandiose promises of eu ascension and funding for camps has shown that she was acting without a long-term plan all along . 
  moreover , `` the eu '' is already making plans to forcefully redistribute another 200 000 ** immigrants ** ( because as the numbers show only 20 % are actually syrians ) next year . 
  * erdogan ( who is more like putin ) most certainly laughed at the idea of eu membership for turkey . 
  `` you want me to relinquish my grasp on power and then turkey can join ? 
  really ? 
  and in exchange for giving up my rule you expect me to solve your problem ? 
  [ syria refugees to cost ` up to # 23k each ' in first year in uk ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34567209 ) - let 's say that the average cost is just 20 000 euro / year / `` refugee '' across the eu . 
  25 000 x 3 000 000 ( counting the ones that came since 2013 and will come next year , as well as the families they will bring with them ) , that 's 60\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 euros ** in one year ** . 
  one could fucking rebuild syria from the ground up with that amount of money . 
  as a romanian , i can not believe that it is orban , of all people , who has the right idea about how to deal with the massive illegal immigration . 
  [ immigration , world poverty and gumballs - in case you have n't seen it already . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) why do western socialists and a considerable % of the population believe it is possible to help these regions by massive emigration ? 
  have you all lost your collective minds ? 
  look at the numbers . 
  all we will achieve is to populate our own countries with large amounts of people who , on average , barely make any distinction between `` church and state '' . 
  there is nothing special about europe , us , japan , south korea and china that sets them appart from regions of turmoil who , time and again , fail to develop , other than the stability brought on by the very people who live in these regions , in recent decades . 
  ( ** edit start ** ) - ** we are not inherently smarter or better in any way , we used to be just as barbaric , or , actually , a lot worse ; what sets us apart now is the letting go of centuries-old rivalries , a pronounced pivoting towards rationality and tolerance as opposed to irrationality and intolerance ** . 
  make no mistake , if we import intolerance , if we bring in tens of millions of people who judge everything in terms of `` us versus them '' , who have no regard for the rule of law and european and western values , and we fail to instill in them the same respect of human life and dignity and equality , ( as we have so far ) , ( ** edit end ** ) there is no reason not to expect our own cities to become as unstable and as unlievable as cities in africa , the middle east or south america . 
  and finally , before this becomes an unmanageable block of text , i 'd like to send a message to our polish friends who vote on sunday and who 's politicians recently betrayed the v4 by voting for eu immigrant redistribution : ** vote against the eu ** if you can , vote for politicians who will work with v4 and romania , bulgaria , croatia , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania as well as ukraine , because we need to counter-balance germany , france and sweden to fix the eu and bring back democracy , possibly with help from the uk , or , if we fail , we must break it apart entirely . 
  but most of all , we need to send a message and we look to you for leadership . 
  i have a lot of work these days so please forgive me if i am not active in the comments section . 
  edit : i 'd like to expand a little on the issue of `` voting with my wallet '' as this week i am deciding on a new washer / dryer combo . 
  i have decided to rule out buying electrolux ( swedish ) , bosch ( german ) or siemens ( german ) and instead went with indesit ( italian , partly owned by whirlpool ( us ) , made in poland ) . 
  i was initially going to go with arctic , the romanian brand , but i really need a dryer combo and they do n't produce one . 
  so you see , it rather all adds up , slowly .
