  thank you , i 'll remove it . 
  of course , help greece and italy and spain ... 
  i had no idea . 
  clearly there are more things to add to the op . 
  moreover , i believe that with proper supervision developing countries such as romania , bulgaria , poland and others , should be allowed to break the deficit barrier because staying within limits is halting growth . 
  like i said , impose the proper eu supervision on how much is borrowed and where it 's spent , but let us borrow more money for infrastructure . 
  the same austerity medicine does n't work on all countries in identical ways . 
  i absolutely do not want romanian politicians to be able to borrow unchecked , although we do have a serious anti-corruption campaign now , but with proper supervision , i want them to borrow money to build infrastructure . 
  for uncomfortable short-term solutions to have credence , one must propose a long-term solution as well . 
  that 's great news actually . 
  if we could get just 500 million more per year for medical staff salaries , i 'd have one less thing to whine about . 
  of course, 
  which is why the uk leaving is bad news for the rest of us . 
  i really hope they do n't . 
  : ( i was quite cruel at the time too . 
  i feel pretty stupid about it now . 
  but at least greece seems to be recovering a little better now . 
  the the eu buys gas as a single entity . 
  as a federal state would . 
  under those circumstances we can build as many pipelines as we want ; north , south , it does n't matter . 
  but individual eu countries do n't put their energy security before others . 
  if russia cuts the gas , it does so for the entire eu , not just ukraine , not just poland , not just hungary or bulgaria . 
  but we do n't have the democratic means . 
  suppose i 'd like to elect a eu leader who would understand better that the eu needs to act like a regional power in its ' geopolitical context . 
  even boots on the ground if it comes to that because it 's a matter of our security that neighboring countries do n't slide into civil wars or are n't taken over by terrorist groups . 
  but , unless i 'm german , or french , or perhaps british , i ca n't vote for that person . 
  so if they are starving give them food and a little shelter instead of money and they will stop sitting on the streets . 
  why is it acceptable to be intolerant of roma ? 
  is it because they do n't have a voice ? 
  at least give them the same chance you give refugees ... shelter and food for 1-2 years and a little education . 
  but stop giving money when they are on the street . 
  we do n't want a pipeline in the south . 
  or the north . 
  the article i linked to mentioned it was romanians who already spoke german . 
  but i ca n't type in all the details in the op or people do n't bother reading since it 's way too long . 
  private is n't really private in matter of geopolitics . 
  : p just because it 's a `` private '' contractor , does n't make it so ; the national interest of the country comes first , behind the scenes . 
  well i for one do n't want to help because i feel i was and still am treated unfairly in other matters . 
  plus , it 's not really a long-term solution , is it ? 
  where is the long-term solution ? 
  plus , we 're spending a lot of money helping those who come , when we could help x4 the number if we helped them where they are . 
  income inequality is fine , but if the eu portrays itself as a federal state in matters when it 's convenient to some , it should be more like a federal state when it 's inconvenient , and actually fight income inequality to some extent , because 7x or x8 discrepancies are not acceptable within the same federal state . 
  stop giving them money and they will stop begging . 
  but we lack enough democracy at the eu level to empower eu entities ... 
  there are many things to be grateful for . 
  their support in fighting eu-wide income inequality is not one of those things really . 
  i wish it were . 
  i wish eu projects came with oversight to bypass local corruption entirely . 
  well explain to me how this is n't true then . 
  please . 
  and tell me how many decades we need to wait before we manage to get proper healthcare ? 
  after all , within the eu , publicly funded entities are competing against each other . 
  i 'll keep that to myself , i do n't see what the point is in having you snooping through my old posts just to lay your personal fears to rest that i 'm not some lunatic . 
  i did n't downvote anyone . 
  an admin ( probably dclauzel , although i do n't hold him responsible ) shadow-banned my old account without providing a message explaining what the ban was for or for how long it was going to last . 
  i waited a week and eventually created a new account . 
  i got banned on this account too , for insulting someone , but this time i received a message saying why i got banned and that it was going to last 1 week , and so i waited . 
   i would n't want to be ruled by a government containing german foreign politics , swedish social politics , british privacy standards or a french military . 
  i do n't know what your issue is with the french military , but what you said above makes my skin crawl . 
  of course . 
  you do present a coherent case . 
  nationalism and extremism is definitely a problem in that scenario . 
  we might not be able to function at all without a heavy hand ready to smack us around . 
  fear of russia and a heavy american hand could work . 
  but they also might not . 
  in any case , unchecked current policies have a detrimental effect in countries such as france . 
  i very much doubt that 30 % of the french people really want to vote for fn , but rather they just do n't see better alternatives . 
  i 'll have peace on those terms . 
  the lego king in the north !, 
  precisely the solidarity that we do n't build gas pipelines around our friends . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  that could definitely be the case ... but , meh ... : (, 
  the idea is that if the eu acted as a single entity in dealing and buying gas from russia , we would n't need to feel threatened . 
  if they do n't get a job , they still cost 1000euro / month . 
  housing , food , clothing , healthcare , medication , education , etc. . . 
  there 's also lng ... but hungary is land-locked . 
   what kind of ` solidarity ' do you expect on the issue ? 
  the us was a major force in preventing south stream btw . 
  plus it violated eu law . 
  preventing south stream was a coherent policy . 
  i never said that any pipeline in the south should have been built ( other than gas from anywhere else but russia ) . 
  i mean ** if he gets a job ** and works there for minimum wage . 
  as opposed to working for minimum wage in romania and bulgaria . 
  you 've got to admit that that 's quite an amazing life-lottery . 
  is n't that absurd though ? 
  members of eu parliament still come from national political parties of various countries yet they voted on something on which they have ** 0 ** jurisdiction . 
  just like a puppet eu would vote to show that eu is for quotas . 
  it 's nice to read a comment from someone who sees things differently . 
  you could be more right than me , but germany is only coming up with short-term solutions . 
  nothing long-term . 
  nothing to stabilize neighboring countries for example . 
  if i 'm poland and i buy 100 % of my gas from russia who likes to threaten me with closing the tap , and my supposed ally , germany strikes a deal directly with russia to bypass pipelines going through poland / ukraine ... 
  i 'm very uncomfortable . 
  i still do n't want the eu to break apart if it delivers proper solutions . 
  hopefully we 'd all be under each others ' thumbs since we punch in the same category . 
  which is precisely why instead of housing 1 million asylum applicants inside expensive countries , such as germany or sweden , you could help 4 million refugees , with the same money , in turkey and lebanon . 
  eu funding should come with eu government and proper oversight . 
  to bypass corruption entirely . 
  bulgaria and hungary are desperate for gas so they played nice with russia . 
  but now romania is going to have enough gas to export precisely to them ( we also found major reserves in the black sea ) because our anti-corruption fight actually ruined a part of our gas-heavy industry so several factories closed down completely .
