  i was one of the few people here asking for more german leadership when this whole thing began , and i would agree to refugee quotas if a long-term solution would be presented as well . 
  instead i see only a push to make the refugee/immigrant quotas permanent . 
  there are no long-term solutions to help syrians who are left behind in camps ; help them to rebuild their lives and to slow down their migration into europe . 
  not all all . 
  eastern european security is provided by nato . 
  us , uk , france and even turkey , more than the eu . 
  we would be completely fine with us backing only , outside of the eu . 
  one incident ?!,

  see what you devolve into when you 're out of arguments ? 
  not even 3 or 4 days ago they were saying they will register everyone ... 
  unfortunately :  marine le pen 's fn is polled to win around 30 per cent of the national vote -- tied or slightly ahead of nicolas sarkozy 's centre-right ump i doubt that 30 % of the french people are actually far-right extremists . 
  i 'm sure they are voting far-right because they have reached their limits . 
  well done polan, 
  for the free german money to live in slovenia , of course . 
  where do i sign up ? 
  just how much do you think it costs to house , feed , clothe , educate etc a refugee ? 
  relevant username . 
  who would pick your cucumbers ? 
  ridiculous . 
  i 'm not going to name anything . 
  you have turks and kurds trying to murder each other on the streets of frankfurt . 
  there are russians and ukrainians in germany too , and all over the world . 
  why are n't they fighting in the streets trying to hurt each other ? 
   is it just general islamophobia ? 
  as opposed to the us , we fail to integrate them because people in the west are too scared of that word . 
  [ and 80 % of them are not syrians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3laja7/bbcs_defence_editor_reflects_on_europes_migrant/ ) : \\, 
  ** you have to walk 1km to get free food ? 
  ** 60 romanian children walk 3km ( one way ) every single day , even in winter , on muddy roads wearing boots , just to get to school . 
  unfortunately we barely used 54 % of what was available for us , or ~ 9.9 billion euros since 2007 . 
  or just over 1 billion euros / year ... 
  perhaps because it costs over 1000 euro / month / refugee to help people here and the same money could help x4 the people in camps . 
  on the contrary i see you reading selectively right now . 
  well you do n't have german overlords . 
  i 'm starting to lean towards taking russia 's offer honestly . 
  grand coalition to go in an restore peace in north africa and the middle east . 
  do away with isis as a subject of news articles once and for all . 
  donations and foreign aid are better spent if these people have some security to rebuild their lives . 
  sometimes investments fail . 
  a message for other risk takers . 
  for every illegal economic migrant that we help in europe out of those 80 % non-syrians , we could probably help 4 syrians who are still in camps in turkey and lebanon . 
  looks like orban had the right response all along . 
  where are all the germans on this sub whom i have been arguing for the past 2 weeks ? 
  is it worth risking the integrity of the eu for 20 % syrians ? 
  or should we say stop , please do n't come . 
  and focus on helping syrians in refugee camps ?!, 
  i 'll agree we need to do more to reduce world-wide income inequality and fight poverty , but trying to take in even tens of millions of people or indeed a few hundred million people will not noticeably reduce world-poverty . 
  more regions need to be experience long-term peace and stability so that they can become industrialized ... after all , the poorest people live in the most sunny place and we can donate solar panels in large quantities . 
  just 20.1 % ?!!, 
  in romania please : d, 
  : ] well if i left that out then russians would think i 'm singling them out . 
  we found all these navy ships abandoned , adrift in the mediterranean ... ** oh look !, 
  someone threw away 2 perfectly good mistrals ... **, 
  [ serious ] ca n't we just claim it 's european tourists ?!, 
  * i can think of no better fuck you addressed to putin than that * just give all the tourists un-market blue uniforms and claim we 're not involved . 
  he is already using the un as a convenient toilet . 
  yes , the us did n't give a rats ass about the un when it invaded iraq , which is what ticked putin to the idea that world powers do n't really care about the un when they act ... 
  so , as with the us , russia too will only use the un when it 's convenient . 
  we should n't be afraid that we 'll break the un when it 's already broken . 
  sounds like a good idea . 
  ** these are not refugees ** . 
  these are legit swiss people : d. anyway , it 's a repost . 
  we already know the swiss are fighting each other because of the conflict between turkey and the kurds . 
  this exact video along with a more graphic one were posted before . 
  apparently the swiss have gone insane . 
  i ca n't for the life of me understand why swiss people would be trying to seriously injure or kill each other over a conflict thousands of kms away . 
  anyway germans in frankfurt have also been fighting each other over the same issue , in massive crowds/groups and the same happened in sweden where swedes even damaged police cars when they rioted . 
  whoa , downvotes because they 're not syrian now ? 
  that 's the point ; that i have n't heard merkel critize hungary for events yesterday : d, 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you . 
  i never said unregistered . 
  i called it days ago . 
  this is the only civilized way to transport them to germany . 
  and if we want to behave like civilized people , we 've got to do it . 
  but this ca n't last . 
  eventually germans and swedes will say : we can take no more . 
  then what ? 
  we need a proper long-term solution which will hopefully come after the refusal of the eastern block to take quotas at the eu summit . 
  are n't they fighting fascists in ukraine ? 
  when schengen breaks down before you even join . 
   the eu as a whole has n't done much to force hungary to allow the migrants to travel through its borders into richer nations , seeming to tacitly approve of hungary 's methods which is beginning to stem migrant flow . 
  wow, 
  ( : thanks for pointers, 
  grass is always greener ... :d, 
  what other choice is there ? 
  we ca n't take in the entire world and we ca n't shoot people who come either . 
  ideally we can give them the means to build something they would like to defend themselves . 
  naaaah , i do n't believe that . 
  some parties will compromise to stay in power ... 
  they wont get to 51 , but 40 is good enough to make some much needed changes i imagine, 
  im just curious . 
  to each his own then . 
  i suggest you take a year or two and work in austria and see what its like , but be objective . 
  what a lot of migrant workers do is they get hipnotized with the mirage of a famous city or country . 
  : p it depends of course . 
  for some , it can be a real , massive improvement in quality of life while others are n't much better off . 
  if i move from romania , i 'm probably coming to slovenia . 
  is n't metro the same news paper which we saw printed ` welcome to sweden ' and dedicated every single article in the paper on ` what we can do for refugees ' ? 
  slovenia offers a similar setting with austria but one where you can afford to live in a 200 square metre house ... either rent or buy .
