  the czech republic is the first eastern country to plateau on the possible growth brought on by western investment and membership in the eu . 
  as the growth of wages stops and the eu ( and the west ) is unwilling to create a mechanism to reduce income inequality more rapidly , the czech republic is going to be the first country to contemplate leaving the free-trade zone and imposing import taxes . 
  it ca n't do it alone , but poland , slovakia , hungary and the rest are n't far behind . 
  there is no way that the people accept stagnating wages at 750 - 900 - 1000 euros when people next door are making more than double ; they 're going to push their political class to raise wages which will mean entering into a conflict with the west ( corporations and the politicians they control ) . 
  right , but the growing ideological rift between east and west is going to have the opposite effect . 
  it 's going to cement power among the western countries since the east is not fully integrated . 
  meaning that to join the `` ever closer union '' one by one eastern states are going to have to adhere to western imposed values ( open borders , political correctness , etc ) which they wont do . 
  the alternative of joining `` ever closer union '' as a block and trying to commandeer eu politics as a whole wo n't be accepted by the west . 
  in other words if we create a split now , it 's going to be permanent and eastern countries are going to continue integrating into the [ intermarium ] ( http://predsjednica.hr/files/newsletter%20views%20and%20news_no%202.pdf ) . 
  for the sake of having a united europe it 's better to stay in a single speed eu for the time being and let the power-struggle between france-germany and v4-italy play out . 
  it 's an exaggeration but more or less true . 
  every km you go on a bike you do n't go on a car . 
  still , they should n't take justice into their own hands ... [ then again when i think of swedish police ... ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/638650/outrage-as-police-chief-shows-sympathy-for-migrant-who-killed-refugee-centre-worker ), 
  pis won because wages in eastern poland are n't much higher than wages in romania despite romania only joining the eu in 2007 . 
  the poles are becoming more nationalistic because of the many failures of the franco-german-lead eu . 
  fighting income inequality at the eu level , upholding eu borders , forcing immigrants to integrate or get the fuck out , and many other . 
  the czechs work for a lot less essentially doing the same jobs as germans ; i 've tried to explain many times here that many german factories in the east are subsidiaries who produce for 1 client only . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage that is why even with 4.5 % unemployment czech wages are n't even at portuguese levels , let alone spanish levels , despite the unemployment in spain . 
   you 're entirely missing my point and i think it 's pretty obvious that you 're doing it in purpose . 
  creating a supranational european nation will not work . 
  i have replied to you with this sentence at least fifteen times . 
  we do n't want it . 
  romanians do n't . 
  poles do n't . 
  greeks do n't . 
  brits do n't . 
  basically no one does . 
  plenty of people want it . 
  myself included which is why i am so disappointed with german leadership and failure to create it . 
  enough now , let poland have a go at it too . 
  you 're not being truthful in germany . 
  post ww1 the winning camp fucked and humiliated germany and that 's what allowed hitler to get into power . 
  30 % unemployment you had in 1932 ... do you know of any countries in europe with that level of unemployment while germany enjoys 4.5 % ? 
  right , so why not be truthful about it so we can prevent it happening again rather than trying to forget ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with the truth . 
  i doubt it often goes beyond friendly banter ... in the same way some europeans make fun of each other and even show rivalry . 
  but the distinction is that in the end americans share a fate and europeans do n't . 
  german keyboard layout has z and y switched . 
  oh , and i 've just instantly explained his adversity to nationalism . 
  yes ... : (, 
  so you think the average american would say the same about another american ? 
  i am not saying germany is the source of all evil ; it 's an amazing nation with wonderful people . 
  it 's just not suitable to be the leading political and ideological nation of the eu . 
  could you please point to something i said which is not accurate so i can rectify or delete it ? 
   which is the common market of 500 million consumers , and the potential of that market will always be there . 
  that market predominantly serves a major raw materials importing and finished product exporting behemoth , can you guess who i 'm talking about ? 
   you propose a better alternative solution i am here waiting eagerly for your solution . 
  it 's been 5 years . 
   there is nothing wrong with cyclists actually there is , cyclists do n't buy cars and cars and the life-force of european prosperity . 
  any car-manufacturing nation promoting an anti-car culture is shooting itself in the foot . 
  and if you 're concerned with pollution , look at tesla , solar power and wind power ; it is possible to have cars as well as clean air . 
  ~ ~ liberal ~ ~ * iliberal * :d whether it 's hungary or poland changing some laws or sweden censoring immigrant-crime related news , germany doing the same or removing facebook posts ... 
  except for the fact that neither peace nor prosperity are perpetual or ever under your complete control . 
  sometimes you just get fucked . 
  anyway , what 's your plan to regain prosperity in southern europe ? 
  we 've had 5 years of austerity and we 're still at 15-25 % unemployment ... what 's next ? 
  what do you do when regaining prosperity in one region , means losing some of it in another ? 
  [ western youths are aimless and lost and decadent even when they ride bicycles :p ( car-burning has now spread from france to germany , please do n't act like all of this is normal , * oh they 're just kids , etc * , no , this is frightening ) ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-cars-20160207-story.html ) we do not want those mentally ill , dirty and jobless , anarchists who protest anything from nuclear power to global warming , violently , to appear in eastern europe . 
  and for that , more traditional values are needed . 
   `` promoting gender ideology or homosexuality '' homosexuality is a natural human trait ; you may promote tolerance for homosexuality but what is the use of promoting homosexuality itself as a way of life ? 
  you are either gay or you 're not . 
   the current polish government represent the europe from the 60s . 
  we need more of old europe . 
  not the wars or the hate , certainly , but we do need the pride to stand up and shout to the world that european values are the best values and that our culture and civilization are superior ( essentially what the us is doing on a daily basis , u s a , u s a. . . we 're # 1 , the best country on earth , etc. . . ) . 
  and also that immigration to europe is a privilege , not a right , and it implies adopting our values and way of life , ** fully ** . 
  some european values need a reform ( policy of open borders and illegal immigration ) , some need more protection than western nations are capable of offering ( gender equality , protecting women from abuse like genital mutilation and child brides ) and some need to be created ( european defense , military , army ) . 
   seems like i had the same idea that 's why everyone turns a blind eye to the tragedy in greece and spain and then you are outraged why extreme political parties rise to power there and you blame them * again * despite that they have 25 % unemployment . 
  you have the same idea , but that idea is not a basis for building the eu . 
   i also do n't value a german life more than every other nationality . 
  think what you want , but - for me - being born in a specific country does n't make you more important than other people . 
  i do . 
  ^ and ^ of ^ course ^ i ^ am ^ obliged ^ to ^ say ^ that ^ i ^ do , ^ irrespective ^ of ^ race ^ or ^ skin ^ color ^ because ^ * racism * ... and in my opinion this is why having germans as the leading european nation , we can not build a european state . 
  because having a state , implies having borders and valuing ** your own ** above others . 
  and i 'm sorry to say that looking around at the state of european nations today , i only see poland ( v4 ) as capable of bringing back those * nation-building * values and hopefully infusing them into eu institutions : borders , citizenship , legal immigration , shared fate and identity , european culture and traditions , european values . 
   according to the european commission : [ 4 ] the motto means that , via the eu , europeans are united in working together for peace and prosperity ... ^ peace ^ and ^ prosperity ^ ^ peace ^ ^ and ^ ^ prosperity in other words when peace and prosperity ran out , there was no reason to be united anymore . 
  hence why germany is against nato troops in poland and romania . 
  hence why northern europe does n't want to bail out southern europe . 
  you can only build a state on nationalism but since our german overlords have such an adversity to nationalism merkel has utterly failed ( even though she always said that the eu is her project ) to instill that into the eu and give a reason for europe to have an army and for the north to bail out the south . 
  ___ it 's not prosperous for the germans to antagonize their gas supplier for the sake of poland and romania ... 
  it 's not prosperous for northern europeans to bail out southern europeans and prevent 15-25 % unemployment in those regions ... only a sense of common or shared fate and identity can justify helping someone even if they fucked up , even if it 's not economically prosperous to do so . 
  i invite anyone to argue otherwise and explain why the us needs to have bilateral relations with romania and poland in order to move equipment here and why greece , portugal , spain , croatia and southern italy and southern france are in the state that they are in regarding unemployment . 
  ___ german / u/timaeger writes :  sorry to break it to you , but many western europeans do n't see a difference between romania and egypt . 
  they see both the way you see these evil refugees . 
   we have free-trade and free movement of people because it 's benefiting both sides . 
  germany has a bigger market and can outsource some industries for cheaper workforce , romania gets industry , jobs and aid to build infrastructure . 
   but romania is in the eu and get all its benefits , while egypt is n't ? 
  also , yes it is racist to see more value in a white european than a black african . 
  [ permalink to comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/44wcu5/germany_runs_up_highest_trade_surplus_as_exports/cztduz7 ) notice how he sees skin color , not citizenship and culture as the base of his reasoning ... staggering . 
  because you do n't see a problem with using anecdotal evidence as proof that belgium is a safe country ... 
  you seem to lack one . 
  do you have an education ? 
  oh that 's funny , when it 's france proposing fiscal redistribution and berlin blocking it . 
  you have no data on the imports to make that statement . 
  any overall increase is bad because you take in natural resources which have a low added value and you export finished products which have a high added value . 
  anecdotal story . 
  can you not read ? 
   [ german-made goods were in strong demand all over the world last year , with exports to the eu rising 7.0 percent and exports to other countries rising 5.6 percent , destatis said . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/44wcu5/germany_runs_up_highest_trade_surplus_as_exports/cztcety ), 
  then there is no eu and eventually it 's going to be better out than in , with such an exporting monster as germany . 
  do you think a californian would say the same thing about an iowan ?
