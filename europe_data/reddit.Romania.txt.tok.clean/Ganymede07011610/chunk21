  20 years ago when i was in primary school i had to go through similar ordeals . 
  they ( we ) have for centuries . 
  / badjoke , disgusting , deplorable joke worth going to hell over, 
  i disagree with what she says about `` christian white men '' providing better for their families , that is simply not true . 
  europe / the us were just incredibly lucky that the renaissance ' , religious reformation and the industrial revolution took place here ; after all , after the fall of the roman empire we were little more that a minor , shitty , religious and backwards culture . 
  men here are not inherently better than men anywhere else . 
  ancient egypt , 3000 years of china , japan come to mind easily as just as good if not better examples of men building infrastructure and empire and providing for their families . 
  but what she says about not being able to help every single person in the world , is true . 
  it 's simply not possible and sometimes leaders need to make difficult decisions . 
  ah , thank you . 
  basically she blames feminists and feminized men who think they can help everyone on earth . 
  and pointed out that real men sometimes make difficult choices .

  < corruption  1bn euro < / corruption , 
  that image turns my stomach . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
   german interior minister hans-peter friedrich told a meeting of eu interior ministers in brussels on thursday that bulgaria and romania do not meet the criteria to join the 26-member , visa-free schengen zone . 
  `` there are some areas of weakness , such as in the functionality of the judicial system , that prevents us from saying : abolish the borders , '' said friedrich , warning that a wave of impoverished people could migrate to germany in search of better social services . 
  this is only a pretext . 
  if there was a wave it could migrate ** now ** as schengen has nothing to do with eu migration and social services . 
  after all , the british are complaining about romanians on welfare , now . 
  ** jesus christ did he actually say that ?!, 
  ** that 's a complete lie . 
  [ romanians could apply for welfare in holland as eu citizens ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand.htm ) yet they are not even on that graph . 
   a wave of impoverished people could migrate to germany in search of better social services . 
  ** oh , the fucking irony !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  ** of refugees who want germany and sweden and not other fucking ** safe ** countries precisely because welfare and free shit and social services . 
  this basically just confirms what i said above . 
  impoverished white / europeans can fuck off . 
  good for the slovakians . 
  [ i just read a decent article ] ( http://www.revista22.ro/umanitarismul-si--a-atins-limitele-59114.html#.vfflx2wxidi.facebook ) basically saying that the old communist hopes of full equality between classes has evolved into a sort of `` worldwide equality between races , cultures and birthplaces '' and a utopian desire of westerners to help people of other races and cultures . 
  that explains the attitude of some germans in this sub who could n't care less that thousands of romanian children walk 10km or more to school or that resident medics in romania earn 200euro / month + food-stamps . 
  instead all you are outraged about is why we do n't help people of other cultures / nationalities . 
  i did not hear the german cry to help ukrainians even though millions are displaced internally . 
  i did not see german donations sent to ukraine and i did not see welcome signs or any effort to help displaced children in ukraine . 
  maybe it 's just because ukrainians have the wrong skin color to be a person in need . 
  i 've been on reddit 3 years and i still do n't know what that means, 
  i 'm tired of arguing . 
  holy crap . 
  major til for me :o, 
  from falling bullets ? 
  i had no idea . 
  i 've never heard of it happening ... 
  but policemen use their weapons so little in europe , no wonder, 
  assuming it takes ~ 1000 euros / month / refugee to : house , feed , clothe , educate , counsel , police , transport , offer medical assistance , offer pocket money , etc google just offered to help 458 refugees for 1 year using its ' own money . 
  but i 'm sure the marketing / social media gain from this will actually make it slightly profitable in the end . 
  or translate it precisely if it 's in another language , yes . 
  i meant when it 's falling back down to earth . 
  well this one will get removed because op changed the original title, 
  ~ ~ i doubt it has enough velocity to crack someones ' coconut : d ~ ~, 
  how so ? 
  i think just being on reddit makes one way less effective at work . 
  i 'm pretty sure it is in all of europe . 
  lets open the border to africa and the middle-east ; what could go wrong ? 
  google translate is failing me , did anyone get hurt ? 
  [ not while the priests are there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqnnh7i07ry ) / joke, 
  you 're too much of a pessimist and you just generalized with regard to every single actor in there . 
  sometimes i forget than [ poles ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/sydney_olympic_park_forest_of_poles.jpg/1280px-sydney_olympic_park_forest_of_poles.jpg ) ... 
  hopefully , someday we 'll manage to remove religion from our schools . 
  but today is not that day . 
  french-run camps consisting of illegal immigrants . 
  you must consider yourself to be so clever , huh ? 
  i was overwhelmingly skeptical during the first few minutes but by the end of the video i started to see her point of view . 
  really spiegel.de ?!, 
  last time i open your website . 
  i know too little about internal german issues to comment on the subject , but i only hope you are not fighting far-right with far-left ideologies / organizations . 
  the fact that they went out of the way to hire them in particular , gives me a few clues . 
  ** known rapes ** in french-run illegal immigrant camps , `` when is it ok to beat your wife '' conferences in near paris , turks and kurds trying to kill each other in switzerland , fights in germany and and urban grenades sweden . 
  what is ~ ~ europe ~ ~ western europe coming to ? 
  it 's precisely because germany is an export-addicted country that i do n't believe they will go as far as to impose quotas . 
  wait , that 's unbelievable . 
  they actually hired people who have known far-left beliefs to monitor anti-refugee posts on facebook ?!, 
  what if they remove posts who simply express criticism of immigration policy in general ? 
  so fences do actually work . 
  now if germany wants then , germany can register them and fingerprint them herself , and take them on trains , herself . 
  and i do n't care about the emotions of western europe , so what are we arguing about ? 
  if it 's a failed marriage surely we can divorce without too much drama ... 
  the eu is not the massive honey-pot you think it is for eastern europe . 
  but , hey , i get your argument . 
  just 2 short weeks ago i used to have that eu flag flair too and i was a federalist , under these new circumstances , i 'm a little more taken aback now . 
  if you have n't noticed yet poland is the main driving force behind visegrad 4 . 
  trust me , i know that western europeans are n't `` scared '' about eastern block leaving the eu . . which is why we have no disagreement or anything to argue about anymore . 
  poland is probably the eastern leader the rest of us will rally behind in the unlikely scenario that the eastern block leaves the eu . 
  and that 's fine by me . 
  if you imagine that has any emotional impact on us , you 're wrong . 
  want and have whatever you want to have . 
  what will western europe do with all that money once 29 billion / year no longer go to eastern europe ? 
  certainly western politicians . 
  they can have their cake and eat it too . 
  my personal view on the matter is that if germany/austria go ahead with imposed mandatory quotas , even if the eastern block loses on qualified majority votes , we will see referendums proposed to leave / quit the eu . 
  and i 'm not saying this lightly . 
  it 'll be the only way for mainstream politicians to save face with their electorate . 
  in my view , it 's better to leave the eu than see far-right parties rise to power . 
  and yes , that is the choice , as overwhelming majorities in v4 and baltic states , and still majorities in romania , bulgaria , croatia , slovenia , are against , honestly , muslim immigration . 
  and immigration remains a matter of national sovereignty , which reflects the democratic will of the people . 
  if you want to take eu funding away from us , that 's your choice , go ahead ; but that will decrease eu popularity as well . 
  if the issue is our declining population and the fact that we need more workers , do n't forget we 've got ukraine , moldova , belarus and russia to look to and even before that i think the vast majority of eastern europeans are perfectly fine with east asian immigrants . 
  chinese , thai , filipinos , vietnamese , etc. 
  they all integrate far better and hold/respect similar values once they live in europe . 
  why at the slovenian border ?
