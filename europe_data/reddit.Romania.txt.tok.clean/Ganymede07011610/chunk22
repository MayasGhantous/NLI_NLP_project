  they 're coming from the other side . 
  just wait for the quotas to start coming in : d, 
   not with freedom of movement . 
  freedom of movement is for eu citizens ** only ** . 
   again all you 're interested in is ` what 's in it for me ' . 
  i 'm interested in what is fucking fair . 
  this is a union . 
  we should be in schengen since we 've met the technical criteria 3 years ago . 
  this is a union , but immigration is a matter of national sovereignty . 
  if this is a federal state , implement fiscal redistribution and eu government . 
   because you expect to be paid the same as western countries ? 
  because eastern block healthcare will be perpetually shitty without fiscal redistribution . 
  healthcare in europe is public and so publicly funded hospitals compete for the same doctors . 
  which means that eastern europeans are effectively 2nd hand citizens when it comes to their access to healthcare simply because they ca n't afford to pay as much as westerners . 
  if you do n't see the problem in that , we have nothing to talk about further . 
  at the very least they should not be imposing any fucking quotas . 
   you 're ignoring eu obligations . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  there are no eu obligations for imposed refugees . 
   yes you were going on about that earlier before you deleted the thread . 
  good , then you know why i 'm fucking angry with the west . 
  it 's everyone for themselves when it comes to healthcare too , for example ; i do n't see any fiscal redistribution coming from a federal eu state . 
  meanwhile http://www.realitatea.net/salariul-halucinant-al-unui-medic-rezident-in-romania_1060256.html 200 euro / month salary for a resident medic , for 5 years after 6 years of university everyone for themselves ? 
  already is and they are not playing fair at all . 
  it was a few powerful countries against everyone when it came to schengen membership for romania and bulgaria too . 
  it 's everyone for themselves when germany signs a gas pipeline directly with russia to underpin ukraine , poland , slovakia , hungary etc. . . 
  so do n't tell me about everyone for themselves ; they act as if they rule a federal state only when it 's convenient but do business as usual when it 's profitable . 
  on the contrary . 
  i could not be happier with orban at this point . 
  / no sarcasm, 
  why are all these swiss people fighting each other ? 
  that is not at all what i wanted . 
  i could honestly not care less about `` karma '' . 
  users could have just as easily upvoted him and downvoted me . 
  i dont care either way, 
  feel free to downvote and move on . 
  i 'm going to delete this post soon anyway , but i just wanted others to see how outrageously some people thought .

  my country ** is not bordering any states at war , except for ukraine ** . 
  i mean , i can understand being charitable , and donating and helping people who are less fortunate . 
  it 's a nice feeling when you have enough to share with your fellow humans . 
  but , wow . 
   we are failing to provide for people 's everyday needs , or even to secure their survival i am not responsible for the entire population of the world , their everyday needs and survival . 
  i am responsible like that to my children , not grown up men . 
  lol, 
  perfect expression . 
  thank you !, 
  sounds about right . 
  i agree, 
   the german chancellor said on tuesday that `` the images that went around the world were n't of her but of ordinary germans welcoming people to stations in munich and elsewhere earlier this month . '', 
  shifting the blame for events to come on the people . 
  wow, 
  if only ... now queue all the extreme leftists in this sub , aaaand go !, 
  last time i checked nearly 30 % of french were voting far right . 
  ( unfortunately ) , but it refutes your silly argument . 
  please someone photoshop orbans ' face on this !, 
  it just felt like a dick move to not say anything as the first voter . 
  the sad thing is i used to be 100 % for a federal eu . 
  now , not so much . 
  : \\ i do n't want any money , i only want fairness . 
  it 's not so easy to be charitable when the minimum wage is 200euro / month . 
  it 's low in the light of merkel and the austrian chancellor wanting to treat the eu as a federal state . 
  in that regard it 's very low . 
  other than that , i 'm grateful for every cent . 
  and if you want to impose immigrants on countries as if you ruled a federal state , then this is not my union . 
  that 's not for me to say . 
  it 's your money after all . 
  sounds like a classic case of corruption !, 
  no , thank you . 
  the matter is quite so simple . 
  the eu is not a federal state , so imposing mandatory quotas is absurd . 
  if western politicians want to impose such things , then the eu needs to be a federal state . 
  which means , ** eu government and fiscal redistribution ** . 
  most ee citizens , myself included , would rather not be part of the eu otherwise . 
  edited . 
  it was me who downvoted just now . 
  i do n't have a comment , i just want to take responsibility for my action . 
  there is no reason to argue when in fact the bottom line is quite simple . 
  if you impose immigrants on eastern block countries you can reduce the eu to western eu only . 
  ** the eu is not a federal state so you can impose anything you want ** . 
  if you want to make it a federal state , start with eu government and ** fiscal redistribution ** . 
   do you think we somehow have more arabic speaking teacher just hanging around ? 
  absolutely the fuck you should when 2-7 % of your population already speaks arabic . 
  i 'm sorry but i 'm still working and i wont have time to read anything as thorough as this until the weekend . 
  if what i wrote above is incorrect tell me and i 'll remove the comment . 
   had access to eur 174.72 billion of eu funds ~ ~ does not mean that that amount actually made it into ee eu projects . ~ ~ and even that entire amount , would be quite low for 6 years if we were a federal state . 
  * ok * , nice , send more please . 
  the title is wrong ; it 's hate-speech they are removing . 
  lol , are there news reports of them doing that ? 
  if they 're already in germany and do n't want to register ... those are economic illegal immigrants , or fucking isis . 
   austrian can take its quota but it ca n't take a number way higher than that . 
  what if the eu imposes higher mandatory quotas ? 
  what then ? 
  after all , your chancellor is advocating mandatory quotas . 
  while not a single fucking western politician even bothered to wonder how eastern europe would fucking integrate muslims into their countries where they have ** a fucking handful ** of polish , romanian , hungarian , czech , slovakian , etc , to arabic , ** teachers , translators , psychologists , and social workers ** . 
  what the fuck do you expect with your ** fair share ** ? 
  that we set up ghettos , provide welfare and just leave them fucking be the way you do there , until they riot and destroy shit ? 
  anyone who is n't left-wing or right-wing in this sub is . 
  it 's impossible to even suggest that we ca n't take in tens of millions of people without some leftist nut-bag saying you have an `` agenda '' . 
  funny that neither you or your german pal bothered to point out what i did n't comprehend in the first place .
