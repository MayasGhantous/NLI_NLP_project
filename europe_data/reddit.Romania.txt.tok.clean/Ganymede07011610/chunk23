  well if only the two of you can * read and comprehend so damn well * , take your glorious eu and shove it up your ... 
  do n't be a racist you nazi scum . 
  both of you . 
  as i 'm already using libreoffice myself ... excellent move . 
  i feel like if only people knew that linux is not as difficult for casual users as it used to be , more would switch . 
  anyone who disagrees with you must have * zero reading comprehension * or is clearly a nazi . 
  rest assured your views are the best in this whole wide world . 
  clearly . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l1s8o/europe_should_welcome_more_refugees_and_economic/cv2ery1 what does `` backed by the west '' even mean ? 
  it 's backed geo-politically in the region , that 's it . 
  is the west preventing civil society in saudi arabia from having a revolution ? 
  in romania we had dictatorship too . 
  we had a revolution and we collectively wanted and chose democracy and we even killed the son of a bitch . 
  i think they did so in libya too , but religious non-sense prevented a move to democracy . 
  because they do n't make the distinction between state and faith , government and religion . 
  and too many of them think that sharia is better . 
  well , not the * nearest * ... 
  probably endless riots until germany organizes trains to take them directly to germany . 
  well the dictators were pretty bad people and did horrible things . 
  i do n't think there is a right or wrong answer . 
  the best i can say is , we tried , but , fuck religion . 
  i , um , it could have been ... 
  no , we are not . 
  the real cause for shit in the middle east is ( among others ) ** religion ** . 
  we took down the dictators and the civil society we hoped for was n't there . 
  all that was there was religious non-sense . 
  yes , i know . 
  but you do n't hear me saying shit about obama , now do you ? 
  and neither did i say anything about the us and how many millions of mexicans or south americans it should take or about the fence they built on the border with mexico . 
  the romanian - us partnership goes well beyond nato and i 've very thankful to all americans , including this guy . 
  i did not attack him for his nationality . 
  every voter is not directly responsible for what politicians decide . 
  ask him what ? 
  i 'm sure he 's a registered voter in his country . 
  he 's not a registered voter in hungary or europe , he 's not affected at all by what 's going on . 
   the economist can go fuck itself at this point . 
  says the guy whos ' country is largely responsible for destabilizing the entire region and is taking in 10 000 refugees * next year * . 
  even better , ** says the guy whos ' country is actually dropping bombs on civilians . 
  well then . 
  western leaders can start shouting and calling orban a horrible man , while collectively breathing a sigh of relief that the flow has stopped , ( for now ) . 
  when the austrian chancellor spews non-sense on a weekly basis implying that europe will take everyone that comes , i could n't care less . 
  i do n't care if austria has reached that number . . according to his own declarations if austria does n't take what is imposed then it should be penalized by the eu . 
  just among the interior ministers . 
  actually i even looked into it . 
  they do n't give citizenship easily , that 's true , and you can not get any welfare or benefits or anything of that nature , but it 's not difficult to get a permanent residency permit as a skilled migrant or as an investor with a few hundred thousand euros . 
  with more people on welfare it 's more motivation for employed people to work harder . 
  what the actual fuck ... just last week he was saying countries who do n't take in more refugees than they realistically can , should be penalized with eu funding cuts !, 
  like for instance , in romania we do n't have romanian < -  arabic translators , teachers , psychologists , how could be possibly take in thousands or tens of thousands of these people if we lack the human resources to integrate them ? 
  that one is a riot / fight between kurds and turks . 
  happened in germany and switzerland last week too . 
  there are no news about incidents like this ? 
  i 'll see your article from ** 2012 ** and i 'll leave this here : https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=france+authorities+destroy+roma+camps ** france evicts 300 roma per week | euractiv **, 
  i know you must imagine we whip roma in the streets here and burn them at the stake , but it 's nowhere near as bad as you want to imagine just for the sake of insulting me . 
  i see countless roma becoming more integrated now and working in construction , because we need the workforce , desperately . 
  edit : ** if only you knew how sexy roma girls are at the age of 16-19 , my dear god they 're amazing and have the best bodies and they also dress so provocatively ... ** ( those that do n't belong to a conservative family ) . 
  ; ) slovakians and bulgarians here can probably confirm , guys ? 
  i know there are n't that many now but the op title says `` after europe allows the migrants in '' ; as far as i can tell there will be tens of millions of people moving to europe in the first half of this century alone . 
  ** i was trying to answer the question , what would happen if 30-40 % of the population of a country is made of immigrants who are not even integrated , let alone assimilated ** . 
  i know nobody harasses girls here for the way they dress . 
  if i 'm a french automotive engineer working at renault and there is no safe neighborhood to live in near the renault factory in france ; if my daughters are harassed daily on the streets and at school , then i 'll sell my house , take a little less money and move to romania to work in the dacia factory . 
  and dacia will welcome any automotive engineer it can ; there are always jobs available . 
  with more competent engineers , the same factory in romania can start to build better and more expensive models and increase production . 
  in my humble opinion , that 's a reasonably likely scenario . 
  for example , as a programmer , i wo n't move to london because i ca n't afford a decent place in a good neighborhood and i certainly do n't want to live in east london . 
  so i take a little less and stay in romania . 
  europeans move to japan . 
  / joke but really , if massive immigration without integration / assimilation takes place only in the west ( as has been the case up to this point ) , westerners will start moving east along with factories , industry , etc. 
  when it 's unsafe to live , people leave , when people leave , industries leave with them . 
  they call it `` white-flight '' but that 's not an accurate term . 
  people of all races move away when neighborhoods collapse and the police fails to impose public order . 
  but there is no progressive majority to set up a positive example to the minority you want us to import . 
  give me a fucking break man . 
  i do n't want more religious nutters here ; we 've got plenty already ; more than we can handle . 
  take them all . 
  all . 
  and if you want to impose shit like this then stop financing the eu ; i want no part in it . 
  from what other french speakers told me that was the sub-topic of the discussion at the time the women ran on stage . 
  but do we combat muslim `` when is it ok to beat your wife '' conferences ? 
  i wonder ... 
  i hope they actually mean hate-speech , not criticism . 
  ** exactly ** . 
  why should we import more narrow minded people then ?!, 
  just because we 're already `` backwards '' , does n't mean we should take in more backward people . 
  on the fucking contrary . 
  all you write is another reason why you should take them all . 
  not surprising . 
  no thank you . 
  you can keep your `` when is it ok to beat your wife '' conferences on your side of the eu . 
  hopefully not for corruption charges . 
  what a pretty girl though . 
  freedom of movement is for eu citizens and visa holders only, 
  large influx of rural people into cities which ca n't support them is exactly what leads to collapse . 
  in the industrial revolution you also had an increase in the amount of jobs . 
  with artificial intelligence revolutions , jobs are decreasing , your bloody genius . 
  lol . 
  well it 's either that or we use nato ; for which the us pays through their nose . 
  but since they 're sitting comfortably ( taking in 10 000 * next year * , and coming to r/europe to bitch about why we do n't take more ) on the other side of the atlantic , i very much doubt they want to pay for this mess . 
  so , eu army is the only way to go . 
  even if you vote yes , you ca n't possibly believe it 's a solution indefinitely . 
  the only real solution is a eu army and for europe to act like a regional power .
