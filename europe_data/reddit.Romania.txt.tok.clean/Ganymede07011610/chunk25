  those muslims * . 
  not all muslims everywhere , they 're not all horrible people . 
  certainly the ones kicking are . 
  ok , i hope they are prosecuted for assault or physical harm . 
  clearly they are not even security guards . 
  do they talk about the kicking in the article ? 
  if not i think the video is relevant . 
  as appalling as you might think a group of women can be , you do n't kick a girl when she is down . 
  why ? 
  some people need their narrow worldview shaken , provoked , offended , challenged , widened . 
  what the fuck . 
  why are they kicking a woman when she is down ?!?!, 
  apparently this was a ** `` when is it ok to beat your wife '' ? 
  ** conference . 
  at least that 's what i gather from french-speakers here . 
  now , this is a subject i feel all of us can relate to and some of us even hold close to our hears . 
  after all if she does n't obey you she 's forcing your hand . 
  it 's her fault . 
  i mean seriously , what if dinner is n't done when you get home from work ? 
  or worse , it 's cold ? 
  could you fucking stand that ? 
  what if you caught your neighbor checking out her exposed ankle ... you have to bring the hammer down . 
  so , in conclusion , when is it ok to beat a woman ? 
  when she interrupts your `` when is it ok to beat a woman '' conference . 
  obviously . 
  we need less of these events , not more . 
  could we kindly help the ones already here or on their way without encouraging millions more ? 
  please ? 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  if you 're still a eu citizen : 1 . 
  yes , you can come , stay indefinitely , anywhere . 
  yes , it 'll be almost free . 
  yes , there are plenty of masters degrees in english , everywhere , bachelor degrees in english are less common but you 'll still have no problem . 
   germany will introduce controls on it 's southern borders temporarily . 
  they 're already coming in from the arctic circle man . 
  i 'd just like to point out that both questions are quite vague . 
  in reality immigration from romania and bulgaria specifically would most likely be even less acceptable within the eu . 
  equally if you ask the question `` immigration from outside of the eu '' there are peoples who integrate quickly like ukrainians in poland or moldovans in romania . 
  so everything is lumped together . 
  on the burning issue we face now , if the question was `` your attitude towards muslim immigration in particular '' , the acceptance numbers would be even lower and the protests we started seeing in v4 countries would not come as much of a surprise at all . 
  yup . 
  i 'm quite pissed off about that too . 
  so soon ? 
  there are ; most likely the bulk of it ended up somewhere in russia . 
  no , did n't advocate a war between poland and germany in the book i 've read . 
  he only mentioned that the us will build a `` fence '' around russia and ukraine ( he assumed ukraine would be assimilated and he did n't predict the complete fuck-up of russian foreign policy to completely lose control over ukraine ) . 
  a fence consisting of the baltic states , v4 , romania , bulgaria and turkey and that these countries would be more `` vibrant '' , he does n't actually say they will be richer than western countries . 
  just more `` vibrant '' , whatever that means . 
  he 's an older guy so he has his own limitations in understanding some directions of sci-tech development . 
  you will probably do too when you 're 60 . 
  fight !, 
  fight !, 
  fight !, 
  / joke thank goodness nobody died ( in europe ) , i am very sorry for the deaths in turkey and um syria and the fighting between kurds and turks there . 
  sometime in 2080-2100 , yes . 
  why do you go out of your way to ridicule the man by taking what he said out of context ? 
  nobody is claiming that what he said ** will ** happen ; not even him . 
  it 's just his own theory . 
  of course he could be completely wrong . 
  so far he has n't been wrong . 
  i hope he is completely wrong on his view of the eu . 
  actually it does , you just need to learn english a little better . 
  my argument is quite coherent . 
  do n't worry , nobody here was blaming all of turkey / turks for the acts of 1 individual . 
  from our perspective , we 've got a problem regardless of who started it , who is worse , or right or wrong . 
  what happens when turkish employees have a kurdish manager or factory owner or when kurdish employees have a turkish manager or factory owner ? 
  apply the above question to all the tribal / ethnic conflicts we are importing into europe . 
  will it be impossible for a company to hire a new manager because of his ethnicity , because half the work-force is of a rival ethnicity ? 
  how does the company justify turning down his application to the authorities ? 
  what if the work-force is made up of 50 / 50 ? 
  do they start fighting at work , do they quit , do they destroy equipment and machinery ? 
  does the factory burn down ? 
  does industry relocate to eastern europe because it 's more stable ? 
  find out this century only on german tv . 
  must enter uk illegaly . 
  edited . 
  i really do n't i was just speaking from knowledge based on a few articles i read . 
  yes , he was . 
  lol . 
  but i think my romanian friend is being sarcastic . 
  citizens of any nation can not be deported , however evil . 
  tolerance towards muslims who break the law should the same as towards any criminals who break the law . 
  stop talking about deportation . 
  but maybe yes , in those 3-4 years before they acquire citizenship the narrative should be to respect european laws or risk deportation . 
  no tolerance for people who set-up and impose sharia law in any fucking neighborhoods in any fucking european city . 
  parallel justice systems are illegal . 
  well i 'm not going to believe you just because you say it 's a `` true story '' . 
  but if that really is the case , i would lose my shit . 
  parallel justice systems and coercion or public intimidation to follow non-state sanctioned laws is an offence punishable by imprisonment . 
  if the police really did nothing about it i would film it , make it public , start legal procedures to restore order , start a political party and advocate a tougher police stance . 
  if i had zero success with all of the above , civil war . 
  civil war because the police force is there to impose uniformity when it comes to applicable law . 
  if they fail and if everything else fails , there are n't many other options . 
  where the fuck did i demand that muslims should be removed ? 
  muslims should respect the laws we have here , like any fucking citizen . 
  that 's it . 
  i must be on of those `` islamophobic '' brigadiers you mention in your other comments . 
  honestly if i hear that word much longer l might lose it . 
  but just to be clear to you , ** fuck all religions ** including yours , whichever it may be . 
  and for good measure , fuck atheists too .
