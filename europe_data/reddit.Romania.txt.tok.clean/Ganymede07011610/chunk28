  :d german puppet . 
  you realize he was right on almost every point so far this century ? 
  i 'm really good at that . 
  sorry , we 'll give you all the money you need to patrol your islands , return the people and sink their boats . 
  why is that ? 
  your government is about to make poland a new south korea to use as a regional power pawn against russia . 
  and russia is a much more serious threat than north korea . 
  v4 , romania and bulgaria will be the new opposition to russia in the region , not the eu unfortunately . 
  the swiss are n't taking in millions , the germans are . 
  i did n't make any error in my comment . 
  these issues are all interconnected . 
  the other day kurds and turks were fighting in frankfurt and some german guy was telling me that 's normal . 
  of course , only on pipelines . 
  : d / s, 
  so you 're going to integrate millions of people , germany ? 
   no , definitely not . 
  this is against the austrian constitution for example . 
  and i doubt that article is really an issue . 
  if german society should collapse due to internal issues , the industry will relocate eastwardly . 
  but this is just my own wild speculation . 
  lets see how germany does at integrating literally millions of new people this century . 
  indeed , spot on . 
  well how can it not be easier to gather protesters in favor of helping war refugees when the media shows them as 85 % women and children ? 
  the message is a negative one . 
  * we do n't want to take in refugees * , not a positive one . 
  it 's a negative thing not to help people in need who are feeling war , in my book . 
  but i will survive even if i have conflicting views , so in this matter i am against too . 
  besides , you did n't hear poles complaining when they took hundreds of thousands of ukrainians . 
  which more or less shows that the main opposition they have is with `` islamization '' . 
  fine . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etwcbz_kedu i 'm not worried . 
  if you read george friedman , poland has a much brighter century compared to germany . 
  no , i was wrong because things were not as black and white as i thought them to be at the time . 
  in my defense , there was more of a consensus on the greek issue . 
  i 'm not saying that what was done with regard to greece was n't the right thing , but that i was overzealous in supporting germany . 
  [ ** george friedman talk in poland ** ] ( https://youtu.be/ywrjtzregf4?t=44m50s ) ( i linked to the time he starts talking about poland ) friedman is the founder of stratfor and correctly predicted the return of russia as a regional power . 
  he also has some ideas with regard to the eu which i absolutely did not agree with because he thinks the eu will collapse and as a federalist i can not accept that . 
  but , crazy things are happening now . 
  if he 's right , poland and turkey are the geopolitical pawns of the us to oppose russia , this century . 
  which means we should see poland as a regional power ( and maintaining a homogeneous population and society is important if you want that ) . 
  i fully support visegrad 4 and poland in this matter . 
  edit : oh wow he even talks about the [ intermarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) in this one !, 
  edit : ~ ~ i ca n't believe so many people gathered for a mainly negative protest . 
  it 's usually much easy to gather protesters for positive messages . ~ ~ ( edit : maybe it 's not and i 'm wrong . ), 
  what an impressive skyline !, 
  maybe we would stop spending on the army if your country did n't sign a gas pipeline deal with russia this week , weakening the geopolitical position of the entire eastern block against russia . 
  really ? 
  literally watching hundreds of romanian children walking 7-12km to school , in winter , through forests and fields and mud and having to wake up at 5-6 am just to make it in time , is n't reason enough why romania ca n't afford 6000 young males on welfare ? 
  what 's wrong with you ?

  5 . to force or coerce into a particular action , statement , etc. 
  i 'm not going to . 
  you speak better english than him and really needed to point it out . 
  hurrah . 
  civil society has , and it is . 
  but in any respect , when facing the prospect of helping a refugees of whom 75 % are young males and helping romanian children . 
  i 'll still choose the latter . 
  which is why as i pay my taxes , i want my money to go there , and not to mandatory quotas of foreign males . 
  here 's another video about children walking 3km through mud , daily , to get to school . 
  well ? 
  is it still a symbolic request ? 
  these are just 2 articles i found hastily ... there are hundreds of issues such as this . 
  mps do n't get to vote on immigration policy . 
  that 's a matter of national sovereignty . 
  i do it because it 's more readable , but ok , i 'll stop . 
  here are 150 children who walk 10km every day just to get to school . 
  not even on roads , but through fields and even a forest .

  at -5 , -10 degrees ? 
  at that age ?!, 
  every day ? 
  now that the v4 is the new toy and romania has some extra gas to export , i think we 'll be pals . 
  i was one who spoke very harshly and very pro-german then . 
  i was wrong . 
  and taking in massive amounts of people from a 3rd party is against the romanian constitution . 
  http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0sba3 ** ( 4 ) no foreign populations may be displaced or colonized on the territory of the romanian state . 
  ** though luck , huh ? 
  damn all these constitutions getting in the way ... 
  you mean to say `` as low as that '' ? 
  yes you can , and we do : (, 
  they all want to go to germany and sweden and they riot if they 're not allowed to . 
  have n't you been paying attention ? 
  they 've already passed through several safe countries . 
  syria and iraq are quite a way away . 
  eu has no say on immigration . 
  no , it 's not exclusive , but within the eu taking a job which pays nearly 7 or 8 or 9 times better , or even 10 times better for specialists , is incredibly easy . 
  you know as well as i do that education in europe is state-funded . 
  please do n't act like a prick . 
  immigration is strictly a matter of sovereignty though . 
  it 's got nothing to do with the eu . 
  ok , if you shout it , i guess that 's how it must work . 
  you are probably right . 
  i do tend to exaggerate sometimes . 
  i am in fact pro-refugee quotas as long as they are voluntary , but i am arguing the counter-point because they are being imposed undemocratically . 
  in any case , the eu should have an army , a foreign policy . 
  it costs more in rent to house a family of 3 as refugees for 3 years in sweden , norway , denmark , sweden , uk etc , than it costs to build 1 floor houses and apartments for them elsewhere and just donate the homes to them . 
  with just a 1000e / month rent you get 36000 euro in 3 years . 
  that 's about as much as it costs to build a 2-3 room apartment or 1 floor house if the land you build on is n't expensive .
