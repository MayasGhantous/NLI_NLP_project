  and they could provide the work-force themselves . 
  further providing them with a job a purpose in life . 
  and something to defend . 
  eastern europeans have thicker skins than you imagine . 
  ( people from africa and the middle east do too ) when you are so careful not to offend muslims they laugh at your naivety and start taking advantage of you and your tolerance . 
  the same way romanians are taking advantage of the permissive legislation in sweden . 
  on paper , that 's how we 're told it works . 
  you are correct . 
  in reality , does the us or russia or china ever really deal with the eu officials directly ? 
  where does the phone ring ? 
  in brussels or in berlin , paris and london ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3knsje/austrian_chancellor_the_eu_must_penalize_the/cuz1oe2 ** if you want risk the eu collapsing , this is certainly the way forward ** . 
  in my opinion merkel is calling the shots on this one and using the eu as a puppet making it so that it does n't look like germany is the one imposing quotas . 
  i am not saying i 'm right , but , that 's what my perception of what is happening now is . 
  maybe i 'm wrong . 
  in any case , merkel is not prepared from the kind of democratic backlash the eu is going to get from v4 countries if quotas are imposed . 
  trust me . 
  ** if you want risk the eu collapsing , this is certainly the way forward ** . 
  currently unemployment in transilvania is 3 % ; it would n't be such a bad thing if some of our workers moved back . 
  but the bigger issue is that eu funds come nowhere near fiscal redistribution and after all we are in a union where income inequality , going west to east is insane . 
  sometimes on a magnitude of 6 to 10 times the income for the same job . 
  for example , and i have written on this extensively , medical staff from romania and bulgaria where the public sector will never be able to compete on wages with western europe without fiscal redistribution , so eu citizens in these countries are forced to endure shitty services . 
  true but the brain-drain and work-force drain actually cost more than the net gains from the eu structural funding . 
  the bigger issue is all the money easterners who work in the west send back . 
  exactly , merkel is only accountable to the german people while other politicians are only accountable to their electorate . 
  * so what choice to central and eastern european politicians have now ? 
  do as merkel demands and risk collapsing the mainstream political parties , leaving room for right-wing chaos or stand firmly united against this non-sense . 
  * they seem to be doing the latter since suddenly they speak as visegrad 4 . 
  ** this is not democracy ** . 
  lets have eu-wide elections and then we can find out what the democratic will of the european people is . 
  my own guess is that the 30 % conservatives in western europe with the 70-80 % conservatives in eastern europe will tilt the balance to a more conservative europe . 
  currently the majority of westerners seem to be imposing their `` democratic '' will because their politicians and countries are more powerful and have numerous means of coercion when in fact , taken eu-wide they might be in the minority . 
  if that is how eu politics is done , then a vote from a western eu citizen is more powerful than a vote from a eastern eu citizen . 
  what kind of a union is that ? 
  either way , it 's not ok . 
  power is fine when it 's democratic . 
  but , i ca n't vote merkel out of office when she imposes quotas and germany signs gas pipeline deals with russia . 
   you are free to refuse the quotas and western european countries are free to reduce eu funds as a consequence . 
  hopefully  but this would also happen in an eastern european union , too . 
  but not in a federation . 
  like i said in some comments here . 
  i want to be able to vote merkel out of office if this is what she understands by `` eu solidarity '' . 
  imposing when it 's convenient , gas pipelines with russia , etc. 
  why would you assume i downvoted you ? 
  i did n't . 
  you 're right , it 's stupid and pointless . 
  then what are we arguing about ? 
  the leverage is there both ways . 
  it might be considerably stronger on their side but i do n't think it 's sufficient . 
  any politician in v4 groups who appears to be welcoming of what people see as `` islamization '' is a goner . 
  ** by pushing the issue too hard in these countries , western powers risk collapsing the mainstream political parties and inviting right-wing chaos . 
  ** ** exactly the same as they collapsed in greece and then they were all outraged why they ca n't work with syriza as they did before with mainstream parties . 
  v4 all the way . 
  thank you guys . 
  perhaps this could be a reason : http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand.htm, 
  you seem to be just fine with parents educating boys to impose their will on their sisters and future wives . 
  you 're no friend of mine . 
   we 'll lose some funding and a lot of public investment in the short-term but brain-drain will stop at least in the beginning they will close off their markets as a means of punishment . 
  in reality , the benefit eastern countries get from workers abroad are far greater than eu funding . 
  but we only need a couple more years of growth before romanians who 've gone abroad start moving back . 
  so we just need a bridge to that point . 
   your whole post is full of wishful thinking and wrong expectations . 
  perhaps . 
  i 'm not infallible . 
  i just do n't like to be coerced in an undemocratic way . 
  nationality , ethnicity , skin color , should be irrelevant ; perhaps they are not to you . 
  either way in my line of work i can work anywhere i choose to . 
  luckily for me i 'm a software engineer with a few years of experience and i 've got an ok amount of wealth . 
  i can leave because i 'm not a nationalist . 
  so i 'll just move to a society where my daughters are n't treated like trash . 
  other than that , i love to live in a multi-cultural society , whether people speak chinese , or japanese , or arabic or german . 
  i actually like foreigners . 
  i barely held on . 
  i would be happy to contribute economically too , but the austrian chancellor is speaking of reducing eu funding as a means of coercion . 
  : \\ i was just asking rhetorical questions . 
  because criticizing its ' own religion and backward culture is the way europe itself evolved . 
   some cultures are inherently better than others i do n't know , i would say that it 's safe to say that a non-cannibalistic culture is better than a cannibalistic culture . 
  are the rules here preventing me from saying that a culture in which wife-beating is widely acceptable is not worse than a culture where it is not ? 
  or , a culture which endorses slavery ? 
  ~ ~ germany !, 
  germany !, 
  germany ! ~ ~, 
  i will be , maybe from japan , taiwan , us or canada . 
  then let it . 
  this is where we see your shame germany , and what you want to impose on others . 
  then it wont stand for long . 
  wife and sisters ; clearly you have n't even watched the video . 
  my goodness , you 're such a pushover . 
  more than you i 'm sure . 
  if a parent is teaching his boys it 's ok to control and impose his will on `` his women '' , that is instigation to criminal behavior / acts . 
  i would prosecute him and put him in jail . 
  ok , you can read my edit now . 
  upholding the law irrespective of who the fuck i am offending . 
  christian or muslim . 
  why are you such a pushover ? 
  stand the fuck up for yourself . 
  yes , i am absolutely unequivocally intolerant towards people who abuse and oppress women , and i will fight them if necessary . 
  is that a problem ? 
  maybe that 's what it takes . 
  being completely tolerant of their backwardness seems to have failed .
