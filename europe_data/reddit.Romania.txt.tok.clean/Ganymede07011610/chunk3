  that is why there is no fucking eu , whatsoever . 
  you have failed to build a european identity based on european nationalism which is the only thing that would justify helping greece and spain regardless of who the fuck fucked up . 
  because if iowans elect corrupt politicians who fuck up the local economy , californians do n't say , well let them get 25 % unemployment , fuck em , they did it to themselves ... let 's fuck up an entire generation of iowans . 
  you need to step down as leaders of the eu if you want it to survive because you are incapable of caring and thinking first and foremost ** of your own ** , before you think of asians , africans , south americans or whoever the fuck else . 
  ** the eu can not be built if you have absolutely no notion that a european citizen is more important than a citizen of another country ** wherever the fuck that country is , africa , asia , or north or south america . 
  you 're already producing and exporting too much . 
  that 's exactly what this very post is about in case you did n't read the title . 
  of course , you probably see it as a good thing but it 's fucking up the rest of the eu . 
   germany does n't run the eu , it even has far less power in the parliament than it should have based on population and gdp . 
  [ european parliament passed legislation to double the allowed car diesel emissions levels until 2020 ] ( http://www.euractiv.ro/economic/parlamentul-european-a-votat-pentru-mai-multe-noxe-3457 ) ridiculous that you would say that ... 
   but you make it seem like germanys only purpose should be to give all their money , industry and jobs to the rest of eu . 
  when it 's already got a declining population and record low unemployment that 's precisely what it should be doing . 
  instead i come here to read comments from germans telling me that they see no difference between romania and egypt . 
  if that 's the fucking case then why do we have a free-trade and free movement of people with you ? 
  if there is no difference in your minds then i want out so i can impose import tax like egypt . 
  edit : and i 'll tell you exactly why , because the * fear of seeming racist * is so engraved into your subconscious that you ca n't even distinguish between eu citizens and non-citizens because if the latter have a darker skin you automatically need to fucking compensate . 
  i did not see or hear anything about german donations to ukrainian refugees . 
  ** at all ** . 
  where is the outcry for the poverty in ukraine or in moldova ? 
   people can also move to germany . 
  if people move to germany who is going to pay taxes here for pensions , healthcare , schools ? 
  wtf is wrong with you ? 
  they 're not going to help greece because there is no european identity . 
  there is only * money * . 
  only because of the very cheap workforce and because if a subsidiary factory has only 1 client in germany then it 's the client who decides how much he wants to pay for them and of course he will always pay the least ( you ca n't sell a bmw gearbox to ford or mercedes ) . 
  if you actually cared about employing europeans and paying a decent wage there would be eu regulation to better phase out income inequality and spain and greece would n't be in the shit they are for 5 years . 
  plus , most of these factories are not really generating profit to pay taxes in the host country . 
  they operate at a bare minimum and all the added value of the final product is kept in germany . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  precisely because germany has a declining population anyway , if they want to have a eu they should relocate industry and factories to where europeans are unemployed and underpaid ; ** not ** bring in yet more people . 
  that way we can reduce the intra-eu trade deficit and balance development , employment and wages across the continent . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/39/unemployment_rates%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_december_2015.png if it 's every country for itself anyway , then what 's the point of the eu ? 
  i 'd rather leave the free market so i can put tariffs on imports and grow local industry . 
  we have a better chance with them than the french have with north africans :p, 
  i was bewildered too reading that comment ... 
  well done bros, 
  where did you visit ? 
  i 'm afraid romania is still so dirty compared to switzerland ; i 'm a bit ashamed of the plastic trash romanians throw everywhere . 
  can you imagine being unemployed for 5-7 years ? 
  not being able to get married because you have no future ? 
  apparently merkel can not . 
   the core ( benelux , germany , austria , france ) will remain i agree but calling yourselves the european union when there are so few of you and you 're not even holding on to european culture and traditions ... well what would that be like ? 
  but um , i would n't count on austria so much ... http://predsjednica.hr/files/newsletter%20views%20and%20news_no%202.pdf  italy , portugal , spain probably too probably not ... your leaders tolerate 15-25 % unemployment in their regions with smiles on their faces . 
  how do you think that makes the people feel , irrespective who is to blame for the shit they got themselves in , if they ca n't devalue their currencies to fix their economies ? 
  good night < 3, 
  honestly i do n't care ... 
  i just want to integrate them and remove them as a topic of conversation at this point . 
   note : data for the indicator `` assault rate '' is provided by the gallup world poll . 
  i think most greeks and most spaniards do n't ... 
  i think it 's about to be ... certainly the news coming out of germany is alarming and terrifying . 
  but , even before this whole mess started germany was already twice as unsafe as poland who is in fact the 2nd most safe country in the world , after japan . 
  in poland , 1.4 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months in germany , 3.6 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months edit : oh but lets look at the leaders of unintegrated and unasimilated immigrants : in belgium , 6.6 % of people reported falling victim to assault over the previous 12 months gee , if this is for the whole of belgium , i wonder what the % for brussels is . 
  oh shit , you actually went legal on me . 
  well i concede my position and admit defeat since i lack sufficient knowledge of eu treaties to form a reasonable argument without spending an unreasonable amount of time looking shit up . 
  not everything is about money . 
  if my wife can walk home from work at night and feel safe i 'll gladly trade a more expensive phone or a more expensive car for it . 
  oh , i 'm sorry did france also live under ussr occupation for 5 decades ? 
  you mean there are literally 0 homeless people in germany who are forced to sleep rough ? 
  ok , what if a french homeless in a town on the border crosses into germany and lives there as a homeless man ? 
  sure can you copy-paste the specific articles of eu treaties which define what is understood by `` self-sufficiency '' ? 
  because i have a strong feeling that this qualifies . 
  there are plenty of actual european youths who ** do live like this ** , but because their skin is white that makes it ok ? 
  they hop on freight trains to travel , play guitar music for money , sleep in hostels or in tents ... 
  i do n't see where the distinction is ... 
  we voted against , of course . 
  ~ ~ check your facts sir . ~ ~ edit : check your facts again sir , we are still opposed to any refugees except for the ones where got outvoted because the previous polish government betrayed us eastern bros. 
  but if i get a tent and set it somewhere and i raise chickens and pigs and get water from the river , i am supporting myself ... it 's just a different way of life . 
  and i 'm certain i can find some land somewhere that does n't belong to someone who would kick me out too . 
  hell , i 'll go begging ( which is not a crime ) and even pay a little rent for that land . 
  everything is legal . 
  not to mention if i get a horse and cart and i have a mobile home inside it !, 
   the romanians have passports and they come from a safe country . 
   they 're not war refugees . 
  no but it 's their legal right as eu citizens to move to france . 
  they are crossing the borders legally and it is in fact illegal for one eu member to expel eu citizens to another eu state . 
  sure , wan na talk about schengen ? 
  edit : oh , wait , did you mean * our union , our rules * as in germany 's union , germany 's rules ? 
  [ european parliament passed legislation to double the allowed car diesel emissions levels until 2020 ] ( http://www.euractiv.ro/economic/parlamentul-european-a-votat-pentru-mai-multe-noxe-3457 ) that would make a bit more sense considering the eu parliament is passing preferential legislation for a private german company ... 
  it 's fine to be racist and discriminate against the poor roma because nobody stands up for them ... somehow it became acceptable but i do n't understand how it was possible . 
   well france has to send home 13k romanians because they live in subhuman conditions here . 
   they have no income , no housing and live in tents . 
  it 's not safe for anyone hence why they send them home . 
  really ? 
  wow , the french sound like terrible people ... why do n't they integrate them ?!, 
  that 's so cruel that they have to live like that ... 
  i am certain long ago the french said the same thing when they took in the first muslim immigrants and did n't force them to integrate or assimilate . 
  because you know ... it 's just a few hundred thousand people . 
  `` so what if they consider women inferior and support sharia law in france ... leave them be , they will become french eventually , just give them some welfare ... '', 
   finally , not even the pragmatic argument that refugees might bring economic benefits and reduce demographic decline resonates in visegr\u00e1d countries . 
  although their populations are aging , central europeans do not believe that migrants from africa and middle east will reverse that trend . 
  legal immigration is a buyers ' market . 
  i 'll take me some east asians , ukrainians , russians and south americans and they 'll have a work contract when they get here and be forced to integrate first and assimilate in 50 or so years . 
  my house my rules , our country , * our rules * . 
  she always said the eu is her project , did n't she ? 
  it is actually . 
  she had time to turn the eu she inherited into a single entity , a federal state . 
  but what 's at the core of our federal state ? 
  what do we base it on ? 
  what ideology ? 
  up until 2008 basing it on common prosperity and wealth worked ... it 's not working any-longer .
