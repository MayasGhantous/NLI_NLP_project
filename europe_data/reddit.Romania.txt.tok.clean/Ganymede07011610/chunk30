  would n't you say ? 
  read my edit , sorry . 
  obviously it 's unacceptable to deport citizens . 
  jesus christ dude you are weak . 
  no wonder these people walk all over you and continue to hold on to their fanatical backward intolerant beliefs for decades . 
  i 've got only 1 message to them ; accept european values , human rights , gender equality , or get the fuck out . 
  edit : p.s. 
  obviously i did n't mean bitch-slapping literally . 
  but ** the moment ** a parent would impose such beliefs on his children i would take his children away from him and put them in care . 
  he can see them and take them back when he corrects his attitude to european laws . 
  simple eh ? 
  no tolerance to intolerance . 
  make germans of them , do n't let them live in parallel societies . 
  watch , the , video . 
  listening to these teenagers i just want to bitch-slap some european values into them . 
  holy fuck this is infuriating .

  after all if a parent educates his children to be criminals , you would take them away . 
  it 's the same thing if he educates them that it 's ok to control and impose your will on `` your women '' . 
  simple eh ? 
  no tolerance to intolerance . 
  make germans of them , do n't let them live in parallel societies . 
  look , tell me mexicans do this in the us . 
  lol , as i have a lidl nearby my house , this is funny . 
  france not . 
  netherlands yes . 
  there 's also the issue of integration . 
  i would take 11 million mexicans with a smile on my face rather than people of such wildly different moral standards with regard to gender equality , gay rights and so on . 
  how old are you ? 
  please stop with the smileys . 
  like i said , your country is majorly responsible for destabilizing these countries and you are taking in 10 000 * next year * . 
  please , shut up . 
  oh you !, 
  if you think r/europe is right-wing you have no idea ; you should see newspaper comment sections in these countries . 
  we here eastern europeans are actually the more moderate bunch . 
  * to some extent * is not even enough to cover the cost brain-drain . 
  coming from the guy who 's world-superpower country will take 10 000 refugees , * next year * . 
  give me a break . 
  in romania , both right and left are completely against compulsory quotas . 
  there is nobody i can effectively vote for to express my choice , is there ? 
  yes . 
  ** hundreds of millions ** as the population of africa is expected to quadruple this century which us unrealistic but even if it only doubles that 's 2.2 billion people . 
  is it a hyperbole to suggest that 200 or 300 million of them would flood to europe if it was easy ? 
  you do n't seem to have the tiniest realistic idea about population in africa . 
  just ethiopia alone is 80 million people and the size of germany . 
  there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that at least 10 % would n't not take a boat to europe if they thought it was easy to stay afterwards . 
  apply that to the whole continent , spread it along a few decades and you 'll get to hundreds of millions . 
  ** who would ** . 
  we 'll take in tens of millions this century whether we like it or not , but the attitude of potentially being too welcoming , will decide if they number in the hundreds of millions . 
  effect on brain-drain would have been exactly the same . 
  schengen is only about border checks , nothing more . 
  learn some eu law , whiner . 
  you see , the eu , unlike the us , does n't have an army . 
  the logical thing to do would be to act like the regional power that it is and impose peace and stability on neighboring countries . 
  the more accepting we are now , the more people will start coming , by the millions and by the tens of millions and by the hundreds of millions this century . 
  it 's not just refugees but economic immigrants who would risk their lives as well if they have illusions about how easy life is here and how easy they can get in . 
  it 's not a similar situation . 
  the us was a huge , sparsely populated continent , rich in arable land and natural resources ; currently it costs over 1000euro / month just to house a family of 3 in sweden , and soon germany too . 
  we 're already 507 million in the eu and some 700 million in europe . 
  housing is expensive and with the same money instead of paying for rent for 3-4 years you could build and donate houses and apartments for these people , elsewhere . 
  denied schengen by germany for 3 years after paying over half a billion to a german company for border security . 
  systematically have access to incredibly shitty healthcare because medical staff take jobs paying 10 times better in the west . 
  i could go on about teacher salaries , public prosecutor or judge salaries etc. 
  only germany can lead the eu , because no politician outside of germany can impose anything on germany . 
  it 's not really a matter of choice of who leads the eu . 
  but , that 's fine because after all germany is mighty and they 're a great bunch . 
  unfortunately it 's not very democratic at the moment . 
  imagine if the governor of california could impose shit on all other states while only being accountable to californians . 
  that 's the pickle we 're in currently . 
  i 'm not saying no to any of this , i 'd take in refugees if the majority of europeans wanted to , but in reality it 's the majority of germans , and westerners who want to impose refugees but at the level of the eu they would be a minority . 
  do you see the issue ? 
  the more merkel will push v4 on this matter , the more v4 will stand together in the eu to balance german power , seeing as france is sleep-walking . 
  in my book that 's a good thing because we need a major power in the eu to draw the foreign policy lines we in the east are worried about . 
  it is not . 
  germany will do everything in its ' power to keep it together because they are desperately in need of its ' common market and workforce . 
  and germany is mighty . 
  it just needs to be shown that we 're not all pushovers . 
  there is no change the eu is going anywhere anytime soon . 
  no matter how much we fight with each other and how much we argue our fates are sealed by german might and the euro . 
  i 'm a big idiot , sorry . 
  as if i did n't just see us military equipment rolling through my country . 
  that is quite surprising because a lot of the riots in hungary happen because the immigrants / refugees do n't want to be registered and have their finger prints taken . 
  which is , ridiculous . 
   if you want more russian influence and less eu in your country , go ahead . 
  did he actually say that ? 
  it 's the us that is doing the heavy lifting of holding off russian influence in eastern europe . 
  trust me , the brain-drain is far more costly what what we net in funds from the eu . 
  i am a ** eu federalist ** , but in a federation there are no 1st class and 2nd class citizens . 
  * at the meeting in prague , some countries repeated that immigration policy was a matter of national sovereignty . 
  lubomir zaoralek , the czech foreign minister , said , `` every country has to have the sovereign right to decide who it will or will not accept . '' * until we give up sovereignty and become a federation , immigration will remain so . 
  a proper federal state has fiscal transfer and a federal government . 
  the 1.5 billion / year or whatever we net in funds from the eu in romania , is nowhere near close to fiscal transfer and a eu government . 
  in poland and romania , it is our partnership with the us which keeps us safe against russia , because unfortunately germany treats us more like unequal buffer states . 
  like i said , the eu is not a federal state yet they want to impose shit like it is a federal state when it 's convenient . 
  also when it 's convenient for them , they forget all about eu solidarity and go ahead and strike geopolitical-sensitive gas deals with russia and weaken the position of eastern states . 
  i have no patience for that . 
  plus the way they treated romania and bulgaria on the schengen issue .
