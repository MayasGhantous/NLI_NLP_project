  we paid over half a billion euros 3 years ago to a german company for border security because that was the pretext they used to deny schengen the first time . 
  3 years later we are still 2nd class eu citizens . 
  if they want to act like the eu is a federal state , then we demand fiscal transfer and eu government so we can pay our doctors competitive wages so they stop leaving . 
  effectively eastern europe has 2nd class healthcare because there is no fiscal transfer and the public systems in some countries can never compete with western or nordic public sector wages for medical staff . 
  where is the fairness in that ? 
  where is the federation ? 
  how dare they impose shit and act like the leaders of a federation only when it 's convenient ? 
  while at the same time striking a gas deal with russia which weakens the geopolitical position of the entire eastern block . 
  ** but most importantly , without being in a federation , i ca n't vote merkel ( or whatever other politician ) out of office even though her political will and current control of the eu imposes shit on me . 
  ** that is not cool . 
  she is politically only accountable to the german people while she tries to coerce and impose ( be it the will of the german people ) on others who ca n't vote against her . 
  when in reality , if we had eu-wide open elections ( and every citizen 's vote counted equally ) , considering the 20-30 % of conservatives in the west with the 70-80 % of conservatives in the east , the eu would be considerably more conservative in these matters . 
  eu is effectively ruled by germany . 
  germany can not impose populations of different cultures on other countries . 
  plus , schengen treatement for romania and bulgaria . 
  fuck german politics at this point . 
  you mean like mario cheatcodes ? 
  seriously , f $ % k bbc . 
  see , you are learning . 
  i do n't understand why these germans are fighting other germans . 
  / s germany , are you sure the refugees you want to impose on eastern europe will become europeans ? 
  the european commission proposed in may a quota system for relocating 40,000 asylum-seekers across europe , but eu member states blocked the plan to relocate the 80 000 . 
  commission president jean-claude juncker said on wednesday that number of 120 000 needed to be quadrupled to 660,000 with mandatory quotas so that the current number of 800 000 could be relocated according to eu solidarity . 
  i 'm not saying it 's staged but that 's how they gain legitimacy . 
  by reporting right on some issues and then reporting propaganda when it 's convenient . 
  wait wait , we have n't finished with the current headache yet . 
  can we possibly replace rt stream with another ? 
  i hate to contribute views to a russian propaganda machine . 
  i 've no idea , sorry . 
  damn crisis . 
  you still get free housing and money for 5 months . 
  : d take the time to visit beautiful german towns and go on holiday . 
  : ) most expenses paid . 
  according to most articles and reports i 've read , your country needs 500 000 immigrants per year to keep up with declining population and industry growth . 
  and is n't it a coincidence that that is precisely the number of refugees your country said that it could take every year . 
  : d the flow of romanians and bulgarians has dried up . 
  you country just opened part of it 's job market to the other countries in the balkans as far as i know . 
  if you need them , take them , but what 's the purpose of imposing them on others ? 
  to put it as bluntly as possible . 
  politicians in central and eastern rurope are accountable to the people who elected them . 
  to do otherwise is to lose votes . 
  the great majority of the people living in these countries are not comfortable with muslim immigrants because in their view ( whether true or not ) , the integration of muslims into western societies has failed and muslim-only neighborhoods in major cities are very unappealing . 
  it 's not that we are inhumane , we want to help too ; but we should help them in their own countries by using our armies to set up safe-zones and safe-cities where we can donate food , construction materials , machinery and whatever else they need . 
  and it wont be much more expensive because housing in europe is very expensive . 
  so using the same money we use to house them here we could donate vast amounts of construction materials and they could build their own houses and apartments . 
  germany on the other hand wants workers ... _________________________________________________________________ lets consider only the cost of housing refugees in norway or sweden , where it costs at least 1000 euro / month to house a family of 3 for 1 month . 
  20 000 families x 1000 euro x 36 months ( just 3 years ) = 720\u00a0000\u00a0000 euros lets say that building 1 apartment in one of those safe-zones or safe-cities costs 30 000 euro ( especially because part of the work is provided by them ) , that means that we could build 24 000 apartments ( or 1 floor houses ) in which they could live indefinitely . 
  and if it 's a safe area , you can set up factories and industry , donate machinery , etc. 
  the projections seem overly optimistic . 
  but , muh freedom of religion and muh multi-culti . 
  ah , but then the problem is that they 're too far away from mosques . 
  it 's short , so write a quick translation please so we all know what we are outraged about . 
  hungary would benefit from the quota but guess what , v4 seems to have a coherent foreign policy !, 
  and hungary seems mature enough to understand that sometimes you do what you do n't want to do to gain in the bigger scheme of things . 
  which i advocate romania to do and hope germany would , but they do n't seem to care . 
  tourism in our two countries is somewhat reduced since people who get a schengen visa never make plans to visit us . 
  but mostly it 's a matter of being equals . 
  ah , the user had dc1auzel as his username , i imagine impersonating a moderator is not ok, 
  not since the crisis started as far as i know . 
  meh , i do n't mind it . 
  but it would certainly be annoying if everyone did it . 
  he does n't do it when he is not posting as a moderator though . 
  so , cut him some slack . 
  link ? 
  croatia , slovenia , here they come . 
  oh , you know what , i just realized something . 
  ** this might be a strategic move from hungary ( v4 ) , putting refugee / immigrant stress on croatia and slovenia to * encourage * them to vote against mandatory quotas . 
  could it be ? 
  just look at the map . 
  -  ** [ here 's a vote calculator ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kj2e4/council_voting_calculator_following_the_qualified/ ) edit : since uk , ireland and denmark have an opt-out , croatia , slovenia , cyprus and malta seem to be swing-votes . 
  if either 2 of those vote against the resolution does n't pass . 
  ( i could be wrong , i used a qualified majority vote requirement ) i 'm not usually a tinfoil type . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i was just wondering that myself . 
  but if a qualified majority is needed and the `` eastern block '' votes against , this does n't look like it 'll pass even if denmark , uk and ireland vote for . 
  oh , this looks great . 
  let me fiddle with it . 
  a qualified majority is needed , right ? 
  edit : it looks like this will come down to croatia , slovenia , malta and cyprus . 
  yup , us too . 
  especially if they were fair to us about schengen . 
  i support this . 
  treat us fairly , then we 'll talk . 
  are you using the overtaking lane permanently like most romanians do when they travel abroad ? 
  like i said in my op , i do n't want emotions either for or against . 
  i want numbers , solutions , long-term plans and foreign policy . 
  everything you said is true , however , war refugees are much easier to sell to the local population than economic immigrants who take their jobs and lower their average wage . 
  [ giurgiu - ruse , pipeline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giurgiu%e2%80%93ruse_pipeline ) [ arad - szeged , pipeline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arad%e2%80%93szeged_pipeline ) what happened to these pipelines , are they completely or cancelled or still under construction ? 
  lol, 
  if enough food was provided for everyone i do n't think they would be crowding the way they are . 
  does germany have any of those ? 
  actual germans ? 
  could you provide a source on that ? 
  i get your joke , but dclauzel is not actually that bad . 
  he 's the most active mod and trust me , there is a lot of shit posted here daily ; i 've spent some time in europe/new and i 've seen it myself . 
  it 's true he might be overzealous but i 'm giving him a break for now . 
  with respect to what ? 
  this whole crisis ? 
  upvoted . 
  this is horrible .
