  do n't we over-produce food in europe ? 
  it feels like we should have plenty . 
  i 'll point out that there 's also footage of refugees refusing food and throwing it on train tracks . 
  so , lets not use emotion to push public opinion one way or another . 
  lets just provide food in an orderly fashion . 
  while what the hungarian authorities are doing is certainly not ok and we need to look into it , the background music feels a bit over the top and unnecessary . 
  let me correct that for you : `` i panicked i was n't going to get a good photo showing the plight of refugees to send back to my editor '', 
  i completely forgot about that . 
  : \\ why are n't we ? 
  then why do we even have airport security ? 
  just let people get on board willy-nilly . 
  i 'm sure not a single one will be carrying a weapon . 
  ** even if i 'm not a terrorist , if i can get my hand on a weapon , i am taking it with me for my own protection if i am fleeing my country . 
  ** which is why they all need to be checked . 
  thoroughly . 
  edit : feeling -  fleeing, 
  oh this is great . 
  we can watch our own demise live as it happens in multiple crisis scenarios ; now we just need to and the greek crisis and grab popcorn . 
  that makes sense . 
  every single person crossing the border needs to be checked for carrying weapons and registered before entering schengen . 
  i like this . 
  swedes * . 
  they 're swedes now . 
  / s / joke, 
  i wrote that on purpose . 
  hopefully we can start exporting some to hungary and bulgaria . 
  hopefully whole eastern block , not just v4, 
  for a decade gas pipes were shut down in the south . 
  i 'm wondering that myself . 
  i imagine presidential phone-lines in the eastern block are quite hot right now . 
  yes but let 's not engage in wild speculation . 
  we have enough problems as it is . 
  ah , so it was going to libya ; i thought it was coming to europe . 
  then yes , i am condemning germany for using the pretext of eu solidarity to shut down gas pipes in the south and then going behind our backs . 
  ah , ok , sorry , i thought it was removed . 
  what about 2 . ? 
  are those refugee packages ; how can we know ? 
  where are they sent from ? 
  why was this removed a moment ago ? 
  do we have a reliable source that that is what we 're seeing in the video ? 
  we called it eu solidarity and eu foreign policy when the gas pipes were cancelled in the south for nearly a decade . 
  did n't we ? 
  i 'm sure you are right too . 
  desperate war refugees rarely get to choose which country they can take shelter in . 
  [ i called it a few days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k4hmv/angela_merkel_plan_to_share_160000_refugees/cuutg1y ) . 
  agree to disagree then . 
  but is n't it becoming obvious now that germany is using eu foreign policy only when it serves its own interest and abandoning it when it does n't ? 
  the ones who flee to russia are ethnic russians so they have a reason to go there first , not west . 
  romanians often make the same mistake , only left to right . 
  but it 's a little more understandable because we always enumerate our colors right to left but they are arranged left to right on the flag . 
  it 's silly . 
  both of our automotive industries belong to western europe : d but , yea the sooner the better imo, 
  not at all . 
  germany and russia are too compatible . 
  one only has tech and industry , the other only natural resources . 
  if you 're allowed to do what you want , there can be no eu foreign policy . 
  we should rush and give ukrainians work visas before the germans do imo . 
  hopefully v4 will counter-balance german dominance , if france ca n't and the uk is nearly out the door . 
  i feel like v4 is something romania , bulgaria and the baltic states can contribute to as well . 
  especially after for years if not a decade now gas pipes in the south had been cancelled due to `` eu solidarity '' and now germany is going behind everyone 's back working in its own interest to the detriment of a `` eu foreign policy '' . 
  hopefully v4 will counter-balance german dominance , if france ca n't and the uk is nearly out the door . 
  : ( i know my polish friend . 
  we even have our own gas and still pay high prices because we sold distribution to the germans and italians . 
  no , come to romania . 
  we already had this conversation . 
  i do n't think he is concerned about changing europe 's population but rather changing europe 's culture . 
  especially concerned about rising anti-semitism , which i am also concerned about . 
  i 'm sure he , just like myself , would be perfectly fine with allowing hordes of third world , or east asian immigrants into europe if they were secular , humanists or atheists . 
  i do . 
  because christians do quite a lot of harm in the world . 
  such as anti-birthcontrol propaganda and anti-gay propaganda . 
  freedom of religion does n't mean `` freedom '' not to teach evolution in schools . 
  which by the way we do n't in romania . 
  or freedom to use public money to build churches instead of hospitals ; which by the way we do in romania . 
  i meant here on reddit . 
  : ( is it wrong of me to live in a society where i can freely insult anyones ' irrational beliefs regardless of what they are ? 
  i am too . 
  it 's perfectly fine to dislike and speak against christianity , but ... you know what i mean . 
  the moment you say anything bad about the muslim religion they call you islamophobic , even if you feel the same way about christianity . 
  i 'm quite tired of it . 
  easy now my lithuanian friend . 
  it 's fine to want christians to become atheists but if you expect the same from muslims you are islamophobic . 
  because they wont actually offer schengen and then i have a reason to shout and call them hypocrites and refuse quotas as they refused schengen for 3-4 years . 
  i think poland and romania and a bunch of other states feel betrayed too . 
  to hell with solidarity and eu foreign policy ; put german-only interests ahead of everything !, 
  exactly ... 
  i think this topic is the first issue that has made me proud to be eastern european . 
  i tend to have conflicting world views so i support helping refugees and i am willing to accept eu quotas but i will fight them every moment i feel i am still treated differently from a western european . 
  ** schengen now , or screw you and your quotas ** . 
  yes , this comment is very constructive and relevant to the discussion . 
  no you i$%@ts, i meant `` if only tearing apart korans was the new favorite pastime in german refugee centers '' . 
  by the way , if germany and romania are reporting the crimes the same as opposed to sweden . 
  ** accounting the population you still have 2.55 times the number of rapes in germany as we have in romania ** . 
  it 's just algebra this time . 
  exactly , so lets look more into how sexual offences are reported differently in sweden and then we can better understand the numbers . 
   sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in 2005 , which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the ten-year period of 2004-2013 . 
  if you only change the definition , the number should increase ** immediately ** , not gradually over the course of a decade . 
  if only it was ... 
  i think you are pools ... : \\, 
  precisely .
