  in romania we got western investors as well as western pedophiles . 
  41 sexual offences ** per day ** though ? 
  almost 15000 per year ? 
  for a country of 10 million ? 
  http://violentaimpotrivafemeilor.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/infractiuni-sexuale-judete.xls ** we had 723 sexual offences in 2014 in romania ** . 
  to match sweden we 'd need to have 82 / day or 29930 / year . 
  i understand that sweden counts them differently and might have different legislation ; let 's look at the legislation and see if the differences account for such a huge difference . 
  ** show me the legal articles in the penal code please . 
  ** besides , romania is supposed to be the poor , asshole of the world , criminal country , not sweden . 
  he is being sarcastic because he does n't want to pin an increase in rapes on muslims , but apparently it 's fine to joke about pinning the increase on romanians , poles and bulgarians . 
  i think not . 
  marital rape is present in all european penal codes . 
  that was exactly my reasoning too . 
  we can do better than that . 
  come to romania , do n't learn the language . 
  the working language is english , come on over . 
  i 'm currently working with a romanian company , with romanian only developers for a romanian client and the project and pretty much everything is in english . 
  we need you , come on over :d, 
  you do n't know what you 're getting yourself into . 
  the chant is now changing to sweden !, 
  sweden !, 
  since germany said only actual war refugees can stay . 
  the most live-able country is neither the richest , nor the most diverse , maybe not even the most beautiful but it is probably slovenia . 
  thank you , i 'll check him out although i do n't make it a habit to read people i 'm in complete agreement with . 
  :d but it sounds interesting . 
  made my day ; thank you . 
  we found more recently . 
  i agree . 
  [ article related to the arrest of the former chief of anaf last week ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/justitie/fost+sef+al+anaf+retinut+de+dna ), 
  i 've no idea who that is . 
  what i wrote there is just my opinion . 
  no , i think it 's just russian propaganda . 
  a few months ago i remember reading that he was an anti-isis kurdish fighter . 
  there 's a definite divide . 
  there was a map somewhere around here of the divide . 
  why is anything at all too cheap ? 
  because we over-produce . 
  eu should buy it and donate it to refugees in turkey and lebanon . 
  2 birds with one stone . 
  edit : crap : d, 
  you can get gas from us < 3 ( romania ), 
  yes because idiots never post anything outrageous to get youtube views ... / s, 
  : d you !, 
  you 're just lucky i can barely speak german . 
  great . 
  then 3998 more to go ? 
  edit : sorry i 'm not going to trust rt.com you need a better source than that . 
  not really , france is for , it was germany that was against in the article i read . 
  besides , they did n't tick me off by trying to impose quotas on a poor country . 
  i was very much aware of the sarcasm , thank you . 
  that 's probably true . 
  i do n't understand how greeks and spaniards can stay unemployed for 3 or 5 years and not do something about it in another country . 
  one and the same . 
  so where is the control ? 
  romanians are wildly in favor of more control from the eu on our politicians . 
  no , i want you to lead in a way that is in accordance to the will of the european people , if you 're going to lead . 
  you know , democracy . 
  see my edit . 
  of course you should have a say in the spending . 
  your money , your saying . 
  eu government . 
  http://www.mejobs.ro/de/ so you can grasp the scale of the problem . 
  and that 's 1 recruiting agency . 
  yes but the whole country ca n't move . 
  not on the same scale because romanians and bulgarians do n't need any work-visas in order to move . 
  besides , are n't we eu citizens ? 
  if you 're going to treat me like shit then i 'm going to tell merkel where she can shove her refugee quotas . 
  it is literally a choice between 5-6000 net there or 500-700 net here . 
  edit : ** ok , i have exaggerated because i 'm an idiot , but 3-4000 net salary is still high enough so that the problem exists . 
  could you split your paragraphs a little more ? 
  it 's difficult to read . 
  because some 10000 doctors have moved to work in western countries / hospitals and the salaries here will not even be half of those there even if we triple current salaries . 
  and the low salaries make corruption and bribery unavoidable in hospitals and nobody gets treatment unless they pay a bribe . 
  and if all the eu citizens in one region enjoy incredibly shitty health-care , that makes them 2nd class . 
  i 'm surprised you do n't see this as a problem . 
  i cry for germany to take a leading role when it proposes a long-term solution . 
  currently the solution is so short-sighed that quotas increase by the week . 
  eu army / nato , safe-zones , kill ( or at least push back ) isis , produce in europe and donate construction materials and machinery so they can start rebuilding . 
  it 's the same money we are paying for them in rent in europe . 
  i never said we should push back or shoot anyone , we 're going to take in millions as we have no choice . 
  it 's the humane thing to do , but what about all the other ones left behind ? 
  there are at least some problems which are unsolvable without fiscal redistribution , and one is the heath-care systems in romania and bulgaria . 
  even if we triple their current salaries , we ca n't compete with the thousands of euros they get in the west . 
  i know but i do n't see other long-term solution . 
  the alternative of allowing isis to establish itself as an actual state , long-term ... is that better ? 
  what will be the cost of that ? 
  i 'm not going to copy paste my rant from the other post , but i will post the bottom line and the [ permalink ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k7lz0/live_junckers_state_of_the_union/cuvfd3b ) . 
  ** our german president ** is going to oppose your compulsory refugee quotas . 
  i am already expressed my point of view and i do n't see you refuting the problems or providing common sense solutions . 
  quick clarification as to why this is here as well as in another post as a comment . 
  i posted this this morning but it was caught in the spam filter . 
  dclauzel was nice enough to help . 
  i did n't deny that . 
  but without fiscal redistribution at the level of the eu , how are we ever going to enjoy proper healthcare ? 
  i do n't see any way in which that is possible . 
  and a eu which does n't care that part of its ' citizens are treated like second-class scum , does n't care about the healthcare here while it 's perfectly ok with taking literally thousands of doctors ... is not the eu they promised . 
  if you want to keep us out of schengen after we paid 750 million euros to a german company for border security 4 years ago . 
  if you want to continue to take our doctors and impose shit healthcare on us because we ca n't compete with your salaries . 
  if you continue to treat us like second class citizens , when the same engineer , working with the same tools for the same german company makes 1/4 ( adjusted for ppp , in the same type of factory ) of the net salary . 
  ** yes .
