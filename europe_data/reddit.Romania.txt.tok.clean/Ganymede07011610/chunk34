  i was definitely shouting in my head . 
  double standards piss me off . 
  lol :d, 
  i 'm romanian : d but yea , that 's where germany should look for workers first . 
  there 's no reason for it to be there , it does n't contribute to any discussion . 
  anyway . 
  ok , i 'll delete my post . 
  no , but she needs a eu face . 
  it is exactly because romanian doctors are moving to germany and uk that we have shit health-care in romania ** and without fiscal redistribution we will never compete with western salaries for doctors ** . 
  there is no way to keep them here even with double or triple salaries . 
  we can not afford to pay them because we paid nearly 1 billion for border security equipment to a german company . 
  ** schengen now or gtfo ** anyway , ** our german ** president already refused your compulsory quotas . 
  we did n't drive them out , you offered them citizenship and a place to live in western germany because you needed more workers and they left a shitty communist country . 
  is it ? 
  come here , study medicine for 6 years then earn that for another 3-5 years , and then if you 're ok with that , i 'll be ok with imposed refugee quotas . 
  deal ? 
  or implement fiscal redistribution and i 'll agree to refugee quotas then too . 
  ** not to mention you fucked us with schengen and after paying 750 million euros to a german company for border security equipment , we 're still kept waiting like dogs for 4 years and we 're still not even considered . 
  ** ** what quotas do you want to impose again ??!? 
  that 's exactly why merkel is using him as a puppet to give a european voice to her own will so it does n't look like germany is imposing on others . 
  which , it is . 
  i ca n't vote merkel out of office ; she 's not accountable to me , but i will pay taxes for refugees because you say so . 
  yes , because 3 % unemployment clearly does n't do much with regard to what salaries we are paid and as it stands there are about 10 000 available jobs in transilvanian factories alone . 
  and none of these `` war refugees '' would want to come here and work for a starting salary of 300-350 euro / month . 
  transilvania has an unemployment of 3 % . 
  yet german factories offer an ** average ** salary to a romanian automotive engineer of 600euros / month even though he works in a german factory with the same tools and equipment a german engineer works with , in germany making 3500euro / month , net . 
  explain that to me . 
  if unemployment is as low as it can possibly be , and employees work the same or more hours on the same technology , why are salaries still so low ? 
  of those ~ 2 % are 2-4 years away from pension age because germany has an aged population . 
  another 2 % might have various social issues like drug or alcohol abuse , or might just be comfortable on welfare or just unskilled . 
  just because unemployment is n't 0 % , does n't mean there are workers available . 
  merkel can bind them to her own a #s . 
  ** she is just using juncker as a puppet to show a `` european voice '' ** on the matter which is nothing more than her own will mandated by the german people . 
  she 's not accountable to me . 
  i did n't vote for her . 
  and if we had actual democracy at the level of the eu , europe would be considerably more conservative than this . 
  what 's going on is not democratic at all . 
  you come here and live the life a young doctor lives , then we 'll talk about refugee quotas . 
  it 's easy to be a `` great human being '' when you have money , less easy when romanian recent medical graduates / new doctors earn barely 400euro / month . 
  germans and swedes are not the majority of europeans though . 
  if we democratically voted on a policy and the politicians accountable to the european people , our stance would be very different . 
  so germans are effectively trying to impose your own policy , through merkel , because you can . 
  but it 's not democratic , is it ? 
  the german plan all along . 
  1-2 years down the line the narrative will be that `` we ca n't send them back they have jobs here '' ... and thusly , merkel will have imported the couple of million workers germany needs . 
  all the while pretending to be a great humanitarian while those syrians left behind who ca n't afford the journey continue to suffer . 
  yup , that 's probably true . 
  first i 've heard of him was that he was a kurd fighter . 
  give the american a break . 
  he 'll have to learn spanish soon enough . 
  :d lol i wonder how junker would moderate r/europe probably messages in 3 or 4 languages, 
  it 's probably not going to go down at all if eastern europe stands together on the matter . 
  it 's easy to be a great humanitarian when on average a german automotive engineer nets 3500 euro / month and less easy when the same romanian automotive engineer makes 600 euro / month working for the same german company / factory in romania . 
  yes , legal and more east asians please . 
  does that surprise you ? 
  merkel found an easy way to bring in the workers she needs for the german industry since natural resources are incredibly low and the euro is weak . 
  exports are and will be at new record levels . 
  i hope that 's not just a ferry service for immigrants . 
  if germany is opposing fiscal redistribution and german factories are paying romanian workers 350 euro / month , it 's fine that they need the work-force , but not ok if they want to impose quotas . 
  ** income inequality is far too high in europe ** compared to the us for example . 
  ** eu leadership at this time , can only come from within germany because no outside politician could ever impose anything on an [ economy the size of germany ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germany-trade-surplus-reaches-record-high-in-july-2015-09-08 ) ** . 
  yet , especially at a time like this german leadership of the eu seems to favor german interests and the german people seem to be perfectly fine with merkel imposing their democratic will on others . 
  ** dear german friends , you are all wonderful human beings for offering to help war refugees ; i am not denying that and we should do as much as we humanly can to help . 
  ** unfortunately , offering to take in millions * ( and then trying to impose some on others ) * without a long-term plan to stave off the migration is not a solution ; it 's unsustainable because there are quite literally hundreds of millions of people who would like to move to germany ; or sweden , or norway , or denmark , france , holland , belgium , austria etc i ca n't believe i 'm going to agree with orban , after i have been hating him with a passion because of his nationalistic , anti-democratic and pro-russian views but our immediate message should be , ** please , do n't come ** . 
  that 's the only way we can help the millions which will come anyway and we need german leadership to unify europe under one foreign policy because the only feasible , long-term solution is this : ** a unified eu army ( or nato ) to set up safe-zones and safe-cities in their countries of residence where we can send free food , free construction materials , free machinery and equipment , etc ; ** so that they ** all ** have a chance to rebuild their lives , their houses , their industry and infrastructure , not just the ones who can afford to come or dare risk their lives to reach europe . 
  on the leadership / democratic / fiscal and economical / refugee and immigration problems : 1 . 
  if we had free and open elections across the eu to elect our leaders they would be largely opposed to the idea o taking in so many war refugees because they would be accountable to the entire european continent . 
  right now , because germans are greatly pro-refugee and merkel only answers to them and not at all to the rest of us , and because she can effectively impose the will of the german people on the rest of europe , we are experiencing a paradox . 
  i have long wondered why germany does n't push for a proper federal european union . 
  it could take france by the hand and a few other countries and they could simply say to the rest of us , are you in , or are you out ? 
  the fact of the matter is that going back on the euro currency , going back on the free movement of goods and of people would be so damaging to the economy , none of us have any chance . 
  but what i had not realized before is that the status quo already offers germany the ropes it needs to control the eu . 
  sometimes for the better , sometimes for the worse . 
  this is probably one reason why we need the uk to stay in the eu . 
  germany is opposed to fiscal redistribution but here 's the thing . 
  if you wanted to build the eu , if you wanted to take us in , you need at least 1 of 2 things . 
  ** either you establish fiscal redistribution as a federal state would have , or you relocate more of your industry to other parts of europe . 
  ** what you ca n't do is you ca n't keep the industry , as well as the new workers you get from eastern europe as well as all the wealth they produce . 
  helping refugees in europe is expensive because housing is expensive . 
  once all our possible dwellings are occupied , we can help no more but they will keep coming because our message seems to be that we can help everyone . 
  these funds should be used to push forward the solution i mentioned above . 
  anyway , these are just my humble thoughts on the matter and i 'm sure i 'm wrong in some regards . 
  yup , post to r/sweden, 
  i think he already said the words , ** compulsory quotas ** , right ? 
  his english is so bad today i have trouble following his ideas . 
  live stream http://www.euronews.com/news/streaming-live/, 
  nope . 
  our prime minister or president spoke on the phone with your president or prime minister and they agreed on voluntary quotas only . 
  this will be interesting . 
  we have 12 or 13 member states in the east opposed to mandatory quotas . 
  ** where is dclauzel when we actually need him ?!, 
  look at these disgusting comments . 
  that 's true . 
  we did run out of options but i suspect merkel wants a million or two new people added to the workforce . 
  so we need to wait a year or two . 
  that 's because leadership can only come from germany because no outside political figure could impose shit on an economy the size of germany . 
  but it 's also the case that germany is showing incredibly weak leadership and a complete lack of coherence in foreign policy . 
  in any case , germany is depended on intra-eu exports so i 'm sure there 's a limit to how much merkel can fuck shit up . 
  edit : if eastern europe stands united ( ** and it looks like at least 9 countries will ** ) merkel will threaten to close schengen until she will see that we do n't really care , then she 'll back down . 
  so far , poland , romania , hungary , bulgaria , slovakia , czech republic , estonia , lithuania and latvia have pretty much confirmed they will stand together against mandatory quotas .
