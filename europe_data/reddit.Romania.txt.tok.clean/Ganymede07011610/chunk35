  that leaves slovenia and croatia to make up their minds i guess . 
  and i suspect finland will join in as well . 
  they 're horrible people , they were fired , lets not repost . 
  that 's really helpful poland , thanks a lot !, 
  / sssssssssssssssss, 
  romania : neither positive nor negative i would say . 
  is that actually the title ? 
  i do n't want to click it if it is . 
  i also see a lot of 0 's just to the right and below . 
  lol what ? 
  are you high ? 
  hey , i understand your point of view . 
  just like teenagers can believe that dressing all in black and being `` goth '' is part of their identity . 
  but that 's a choice that has nothing to do with singling out a group of people . 
  anyone can be a goth , man , woman , black or white or asian . 
  but in this case it is discrimination on the basis of gender . 
  muslim men should be forced to wear the same clothing their culture imposes on women . 
  then it 's non-gender biased . 
  let 's do that and see how they like it . 
  then the clothing is not part of subjugating an entire gender . 
  in our culture women can dress like men and men can and do dress like women . 
  and that 's perfectly fine . 
  but no gender should impose a dress code on the other . 
  just between you and i , romania is not that bad . 
  but of course , the general opinion is that it 's a shithole . 
  dude , go away with your iq stats . 
  women in closed muslim communities and neighborhoods do n't get to choose . 
  they get immense pressure from their family and community to dress in a demeaning way . 
  to sit in the back of a room or bus or walk behind men . 
  as a potential immigrant to norway , if i do decide to live there i look forward to being a lot less tolerant of intolerance than you are . 
  european values of gender equality and freedom of speech and many more , ** are non-negotiable ** . 
  yes , ideally , adult men and women should have the freedom to wear what they want . 
  but we are facing a clash of cultures which is far from our ideal world . 
  our laws are inadequate and far too permissive to instill the same values in some immigrant cultures . 
  ** it 's a paradox that precisely because our laws are too permissive that muslim women are forced to live harsher lives in europe , than in some muslim countries . 
  no , they should not . 
  it is encouraging a silent regress of gender equality in europe . 
  yup . 
  schengen or no deal on refugee quotas . 
  we have been technically ready and waiting for 3 years now . 
  that is very poor choice of words on her part . 
  `` occupy and change '' ?!? 
  yes because banning a cross around your neck is the same as banning someone who covers 99.9 % of their body in black . 
  you got some fucking rationale on you . 
  then we can probably agree on more refugees too , but , we still need a long-term solution , not just quotas . 
  schengen , or no deal . 
  actually that 's the only thing i do care about . 
  http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results i see several countries in schengen which are at least as or more corrupt than romania . 
  yes , romania is still fucking corrupt , but still less corrupt than italy or greece . 
  you know nothing about romania and you have never been to romania . 
  i have lived in scandinavia for almost a year . 
  your opinions are all based on fear-mongering ; i feel considerably safer in romania than i felt in oslo . 
  here 's one source . 
  http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp i live in the 2nd largest city and i do n't lock my front door at night . 
  absolutely i am . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  and you have no stats on gun violence or gun trafficking . 
  it 's sweden i read about that has grenades exploding on it 's city streets , not romania . 
  and belgium and france that have people with automated weapons on trains , not romania .

  ** we have excellent border control . 
  ** ** excellent . 
  ** in fact we paid 500 million euros to a german company for the proper equipment . 
  mostly germany and france ... 
  certainly not poland , lol . 
  most definitely not poland . 
  you 're the biggest spender . 
  i 'm pretty sure the eu is paying for this party man . 
  fyi , romanian minimum wage is 200 : d, 
  but we 're going to be somewhat more accurate from what i understand . 
  most of the time muslim women have no choice , even as adults because of pressure from their community and family . 
  thus a state ban is necessary . 
  lol , what . 
  lol, 
  my goodness estonia , you 're only looking at 400 at the most ... come on . 
  compromise a little . 
  yes but , at least romania and bulgaria are not part of schengen borders , we 're only part of eu borders . 
  it seems unreasonable to be forced to help schengen countries deal with their problem . 
  i 'm curious how poland will react to that number ... it seems higher than 0 . : d i 'm joking , of course , they will most likely accept it . 
  but our romanian prime minister is pissed off ( and rightly so , i would say ) because we 're denied entrance into schengen but we 're imposed refugee quotas . 
  edit : ** as a romanian ( or bulgarian ) i would support agreeing to that number in exchange for entering schengen ; it seems only fair . 
  ** if we 're forced to help with a schengen problem , we should be part of it . 
  : | also , another problem for romania will be our own constitution . 
  ** we have an article in the constitution specifically against this exact situation ** . 
  i do n't know how it 'll be resolved . 
  [ here 's the article ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0sba3 ) ** art. 3 ** ( 4 ) no foreign populations may be displaced or colonized on the territory of the romanian state . 
  trust me , they barely speak romanian and have barely ever gone to school . 
  they do n't understand the law and are not aware of their own rights . 
  thus , policies against them such as `` we 'll register you and then you ca n't return '' , do work . 
  because they believe it . 
  i 'm not contesting that they leave every 3 months so they do n't get registered . 
  i 'm saying that even if they are registered , or even if they do n't have enough funds to support themselves , if they could hire a lawyer they would win in court . 
  it is not legal to deport people from one eu country to another even if they ca n't afford to live or they are homeless . 
  nope . 
  it 's all socialist bullshit / propaganda . 
  as begging is not a crime one can be convicted of , there is no way to stop returning beggars at the border and deporting them against their will is illegal .
