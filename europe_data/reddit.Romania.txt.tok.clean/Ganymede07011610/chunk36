  what 's really happening is that most of those people are too dumb to know their own rights , so they 're being lied to and they go along because they do n't know any better . 
  i say , good luck imposing that number on poland ... : d, 
  they will probably say that they rejected it because they want to replace it with a much harsher one at a ^ later ^ date in all honesty , i think they are really scared of what 's happening in romania . 
  : \\ bulgarians should vote for small , new political parties to take power away from the main , established ones . 
  with that dissolution of power in the parliament , a bill like this stands a greater chance of passing . 
  necessary `` yurop stronk '' comment . 
  it 's true , i do slam the keyboard quite hard , but not because i 'm raging , but because it 's a filco mechanical , blue switch keyboard and my god is it a pleasure to type on ... but yes , it 's loud too . 
  edit : i do get a little overzealous : \\, 
  you know ** nothing ** about eu law . 
  as a romanian i can travel without a passport , work , move , buy property , sell property , rent , live , marry , in ** any ** eea ( not just eu but norway and switzerland too , correction , switzerland did limit immigration because it can , as it is not part of the eu ) , without even ever learning the local language . 
  there is not 3 month restriction on anything . 
  as a swede you have only a few more rights in sweden than i have as a romanian . 
  i 'm not going to answer your other points ; it 's just your own belief / speculation . 
  and if i get married or i 'm in a relationship with a non-eu citizen , say a nice asian girl ; ) , she can get a visa based on that , in any eu country i live in . 
  that 's how far eu rights extend . 
  all i 'm saying is that for immigrants staying in the new country permanently is not always the best option because the same money will go a much longer way in another place . 
  i never said romas . 
  roma build much bigger but tasteless houses with begging money . 
  that 's a matter of policy . 
  cutting welfare for abusers and encouraging them to move back if they do n't want to respect and adapt to local laws . 
  they would if the region was at peace ... : \\, 
  the new migrants will have the same option romanians and bulgarians have as well , i imagine . 
  work 20 years to buy a 2 bedroom apartment in berlin or frankfurt , or work 2-3 years and build a house in syria . 
  but before that , the eu needs to focus on peace in syria . 
  this one is quite nice .

  ** in the same way it 's reasonable to think that syrians might be interested in moving back at some point too . 
  my point is , both romania and bulgaria and poland , as well as western agriculture and industry have benefited immensely from the free movement of workers . 
  and if people are building new houses in romania , it means they plan to come back once they 've made their lives a little better ? 
  so they 're not `` slaves '' and neither will refugees be slaves if they earn some money and start re-building their houses in syria . 
  go to school , learn something probably . 
  but that 's up to them and the german government , not me .

  there 's probably millions of new houses all across romania , all worked for in western agriculture or industry . 
  or something they will recondition old houses , https://www.google.com/maps/@47.110362,24.6288597,3a,75y,148.69h,86.71t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sztr9uw6rx02ydc6o-sz4oq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro all day .

  in fact , go on google streetview to any village in transilvania and you 'll see 20-30 % nice new houses . 
  or this one https://www.google.com/maps/@47.7231328,24.3640643,3a,75y,48.46h,83.57t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sj2wh65pen9zh2xg-kratya!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro, 
  they return to romania and use the 10x salary to build houses . 
  such as this one for example , https://www.google.com/maps/@47.7093446,24.4358593,3a,75y,235.11h,86.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-zrz_pwgjlx2_63t1mio9a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jyeeh/national_front_merkel_wants_migrants_as_slaves/cutbjc5 so show me french people willing to do this job for just 2-4 months / year . 
  no dutch person would post a picture of that piece of shit twice after he killed hundreds of dutch , so the odds that you are indeed a paid troll just went up . 
  look here and tell me germans will do these jobs , seasonally on a 2-4 month basis . 
  there are countless seasonal jobs in agriculture that germans wont do . 
  especially picking shit like cucumbers or tomatoes . 
  trust me , it 's a win-win . 
  yea , i 'd take a shit on his face too . 
  they are wrong . 
  it 's the same as saying romanians and bulgarians are slaves , which is ridiculous when they get paid 10 times what they make in romania or bulgaria . 
  1/3 of french are probably fed up with some aspects of their society , but nf are traitors paid by putin so fuck them right in the ass : ], 
  i understand there are people who `` have an agenda '' ( mainly dumb kids behind a keyboard ) , but i hope that does n't mean that nobody can create negative posts about a certain situation . 
  there are clear negative as well as positive aspects of the refugee crisis and i hope to be able to discuss both , equally . 
  after all , if you ca n't openly talk about a problem , you have no chance of solving it . 
  are you back from holiday ? 
  i 'm wondering if admins are going to remove this one too ... edit : there we go ... 
  already removed ? 
  astonishingly disgusting behavior . 
  [ and they do this in their own country as well ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@34.736836,36.7151633,3a,75y,71.99h,41.67t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-hylpr01hnks%2fvmagc1s7wci%2faaaaaaaakec%2fbnx9uw2yxhs!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-hylpr01hnks%2fvmagc1s7wci%2faaaaaaaakec%2fbnx9uw2yxhs%2fs203-k-no%2f!7i5000!8i2500?hl=ro ) and i 've noticed the same in every video and picture i saw , in macedonia as well as serbia and hungary . 
  trash-bins in the pictures / videos were not used , instead the trash was spread and thrown clear over hundreds of square meters . 
  hey sexy ; ), 
  are you high ? 
  the point my german friend here is trying to make is that batteries are expensive as s#@t ... and people will care about how many they can buy before they care what it looks like in their basement . 
  and i tend to agree . 
  but it might be different in sf where people might buy it to show off to their friends ; i imagine having a dinner party and then taking your guests to the garage to see the wonder and give them the tech-talk on how much kw and mw and watts and volts and such and such . 
  must be due to that gas pipeline germany has agreed to build for russia in the north . 
  : ] cuddly bear when he has no money . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i do know it 's out of whack in china and they face serious social problems when 50 million men ca n't find a wife right now . 
  mercedes will apparently sell home batteries too . 
  and i assume siemens as well ? 
  goddammit turkey . 
  so true . 
  but romanian politicians are incredibly stupid . 
  that 's only because women live longer than men , so the discrepancy is in old age , not in the 20-40 year range . 
  besides , i got pissed off because he has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  having lived in norway for a year , as a romanian immigrant i know the situation a little better than he does . 
  local women in a rich country as well as immigrant women prefer local men because the one thing that women value way more than confidence or looks , is money . 
  the immediate assumption was that i was a poor immigrant and finding any girl who would do more than have a conversation with me , no matter how confident my approach , was damn near impossible . 
  and i look good too . 
  only when they found out that i was actually quite well off financially in romania would i get any attention at all . 
  way to generalize an entire nation without any data or numbers . 
  if i said that most middle eastern or african immigrants are potential criminals , how would that sound ? 
  god , you 're stupid . 
  and even if your stupid remark had any substance , you would still have a social problem , which is the limit of what i said , since having a large number of men not able to get married , is a social problem regardless of their race or ethnicity . 
  then we should show them the door , should n't we ? 
  if these men do n't have wives or girlfriends to bring over once they get settled in , we 'll have a bit of a social problem on our hands . 
  so childish ... 
  * in 2015 * is it more expensive to house 3-4 million people in an expensive country such as germany over the coming years , or would be better to fund a eu army and set up safe-zones and safe-cities in the countries where these people come from . 
  provide them with free food and free construction materials to rebuild their homes there , in a safe environment protected by a eu army . 
  housing all of them in europe will cost upwards of 50 billion euros , or more , in the next 4 years , for sure . 
  and it 's 10 billion in 2015 , before most of them have even arrived in germany . 
  add to that the cost of processing them all , the added risk of terrorism , etc. . . 
  if next year germany takes in 1 million , and another million after that , the cost will be 40 billion / year , no doubt, 
  in this case , the bribers accepted to work with the police . 
  so to prove that the transfer had taken place , each bill was marked . 
  it 's a common procedure . 
  sometimes , especially in the us , tiny `` bombs '' filled with fluorescent liquid are place in bags or suitcases so the suspect is covered in it . 
  last i checked psd is a political party and if they think that having his as a leader wont affect their popularity that 's a case of the romanian people being too stupid , not a problem of the judicial system . 
   through transparency and renewal of personnel ( as in firing everyone and bringing in a younger generation ) romania , as opposed to georgia is a eu member state and there are laws against such discriminatory actions .
