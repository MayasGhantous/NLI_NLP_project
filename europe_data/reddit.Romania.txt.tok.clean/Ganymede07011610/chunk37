  it 's difficult to estimate the corruption in any given country . 
  romania is under far more intense scrutiny by the eu and us compared to georgia . 
  that being said , i do n't know much about georgia , so i wo n't claim it is more corrupt than romania , but i 'll just point out that that ranking is the ** perception ** of corruption index . 
  in a country such as romania where you have weekly arrests at the highest level , perception would probably be higher , imo . 
  having watched the video in the article , they missed at least 3 more and the map is incomplete too : d, 
  as convicts should once they serve their sentence . 
  but he 's no longer stealing your money , is he ? 
  god , you are hopeless . 
  it 's true , we are very non-violent , non-confrontational people . 
  yes , i live in romania . 
  dna , sri , ani , judges , non-dna prosecutors , police officers , prison guards , it specialists , auxiliary employees of all of the above , over the past 10 years . 
  yes , at least thousands if not tens of thousands of people . 
  true , but at least once caught they are removed from politics for good . 
  and if nothing else , the replacements are bound to be more careful or fearful so the general direction of change is positive . 
  of course , otherwise how would i know about how much my countrymen like to complain . 
  another one . 
  the stereotype holds . 
  i suppose it was better in the 90 's then . 
  was n't it , there was no corruption then since we had 0 arrests or sentences . 
  romanians complain and complain and persist in pessimism no matter the circumstances . 
  romanian . 
  the eternal pessimist . 
  nothing is ever good enough . 
  always finds something to cry or complain about . 
  you nullify with a few words the efforts and years of work of literally tens of thousands of people . 
  prosecutors and police officers who put their lives in danger and work insane hours . 
  for the first time the general mayor of the capital city is arrested ( at least 2 capital city-sector mayors are behind bars already ) . 
  mayors in nearly all major cities have already been arrested or sentenced ; cluj-napoca , iasi , constanta , ploiesti , brasov , i 'm not sure about timisoara but by guess is over 100 mayors , local city or region council members , are already arrested or sentenced from around the country . 
  here you go :d http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/consiliile-penale-ale-romaniei-harta-completa-a-liderilor-locali-condamnati-sau-anchetati-de-dna.html but it 's impossible to keep up with every single arrested mayor or council member ; there 's just way too many ; and on top of that there 's tens of national parliament members , government ministries , and hundreds of various public administration officials at any level . 
  and if you include business people , and private sector sentences , there must be thousands already . 
  [ ** hilarious interview with him just 2 days before his arrest ** ( i 'll try to translate little by little ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be5wsnlai3y ) - reporter : did you have any knowledge of your own aides being corrupt before they got arrested ? 
  ( 2 months ago ) - oprescu : ** we 're not all thieves and criminals . 
  ** ( begins coughing ) - reporter : were you surprised to find out that these people were taking bribes ? 
  - oprescu : yes madam , hand-on-heart i can say i was surprised . 
  i 'll say it again , i was surprised . 
  but if i was to state this daily , nobody would believe me . 
  ** everyone thinks that , or it has become common belief that people in the public administration , are all thieves . 
  they all take 10 % , 15 % ... ** i just want you to think of one thing . 
  i had no obligation to give money to the political party * ( he claims he is independent ) * so then people became suspicious of me . 
  - oprescu : i can honestly say that people in psd ( political party ) never had the courage to ask me for money . 
  not in political campaigns , nowhere , never . 
  they never asked me . 
  - oprescu : of course , they are still suspicious of me . 
  * ( starts counting on his fingers ) * they checked my bank accounts , once , twice , they got all the way to panama * ( implying investigators were trying to find offshore accounts ) * , cyprus , and god knows where else . 
  ok , they told me i have various properties . 
  i do n't have any . 
  ( continues to talk about various irrelevant things with regard to proving his potential innocence and takes some time to criticize the justice system that has become , in his view , abusive ) [ ** live coverage ( it is common for tv stations to dedicate entire days of coverage to major ongoing investigations ; it 's a beautiful circus ) ** ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/media/tv/live/digi24 ) [ google translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-20402026-sorin-oprescu-retinut-dna-primarul-bucurestiului-este-acuzat-luare-mita.htm ) [ anti-corruption map of convictions ( does not include ongoing investigations and arrests ; shows total number of convictions as well as ratio to 10000 people ) ] ( http://www.romaniacurata.ro/harta-coruptiei/ ) [ map of arrested or convicted mayors and city or regional council presidents ( does not include regular city or regional council members as that would be a much longer list ) ] ( http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/consiliile-penale-ale-romaniei-harta-completa-a-liderilor-locali-condamnati-sau-anchetati-de-dna.html ) edit / update : - ongoing police raids and searches in 13 locations in and near bucharest . 
  - he was arrested last night at 0:33 , caught receiving 25000 euro of a larger 60000 euro bribe . 
  he was stopped in traffic and searched ; the money were found in his car / on his person . 
  ** initially he claimed the money were borrowed so he could pay some taxes but then investigators pulled out an uv flashlight and showed him the word `` bribery '' written on every bill . 
  ** - anti-corruption prosecutors claim he was part of an organized group which operated since 2013 claiming between 33 % and 10 % of some public contracts with private companies . 
  - the annual city budget of bucharest is 1 billion euros . 
  - 4 local business owners are the ones who contacted the dna to denounce the acts of corruption . 
  we 'd need germany to live up to its ' actual responsibilities first . 
  whether you like it or not , wanted it or not , you have economically conquered continental europe ( again ) . 
  so start acting like it . 
  we need a eu army and a unified foreign policy and it can only come from france and germany . 
  we need the will power to act like a regional power , not just to say we 'll take millions and millions of refugees . 
  and whoever comes here needs to understand that it is a different culture with different laws and they can respect european values or leave . 
  we need french and german leaders with some balls . 
  ( just a way of saying , i used to think merkel was that leader ), 
  then i support you . 
  just like i would support greater autonomy for hungarians in romania . 
  but drawing new bordrrs is not an answer . 
  refugees are fine and we should do our best to help them . 
  but , potential illegal immigrants in africa and the middle east might see videos such as this as an open invitation . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm going to agree with orban , but our message should be `` please do n't come , we 'll do our best to help you where you are '' . 
  whatever the non-money problems are , those can be resolved . 
  but the money issue is not . 
  we need fiscal transfer at the level of the eu in fact . 
  we do n't need little bits and pieces trying to get independence because that 's where it so happens that the industry is . 
  i 'm sorry but it 's a dream . 
  the eu and other countries will not set this precedent . 
  kosovo happened because it was insignificant and not part of the eu and nato . 
  and if you think you can coerce the eu and the rest , because you democratically want to do something which goes against the union and weakens the rest ... take note of greece . 
  we are all european , and rich , industrialized regions ** must ** support poorer regions . 
  i myself live in one of the wealthiest regions in romania and i understand that we need to contribute more and take less from the central government . 
  grow up . 
  romanian companies too , about 10 000 . 
  greece and hungary are both schengen . 
  free movement is for eu citizens only . 
  everyone else needs a visa . 
  well i do live in transilvania , and i build a 4 bedroom house here . 
  true , romanians are some of the worst drivers in europe . 
  romanian citizens ; that 's all that matters now . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can apply . 
  tuition fees are very low . 
  roads are good but highways still under construction for the most part . 
  part of me wants to make a stupid joke and say `` rioting '' ... but i really hope not . 
  all i hear from them is germany , germany or merkel or deutschland . 
  they better have some idea as to what that means . 
  after all , they seem to want to become germans . 
  * '' we are the first free country they reach going west , '' she said . 
  '' we have to take them in . 
  '' * so , not the same thing . 
  i do n't have any stats sheets . 
  i will not make any affirmations with regard to numbers . 
  towards the ending of the video you can see the giant yellow trash-bin right there and there is trash literally all around . 
  i can not stand shit like that in romania when romanians do it so my opinion of these people has gotten worse . 
  how difficult is it to keep shit clean .
