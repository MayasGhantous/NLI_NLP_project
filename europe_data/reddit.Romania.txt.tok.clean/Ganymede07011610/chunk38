  you found it clean , you were given food and water in plastic containers , now keep it the fuck clean . 
  true , but merkel did extend an open invitation to several million . 
  hej , i never claimed to understand them , i just showed you where the money ends up . 
  i ca n't explain shit . 
  they build these here with begging money .

  ** they would n't be begging if swedes would n't be giving , now would they ? 
  ** ; ) you probably need a campaign to raise awareness so swedes stop gibing , because gib gib gib is what some romanians are after . 
  no , but that does n't help matters , does it ? 
  funny that it is at risk because of her own declarations . 
  really sped * up today . 
  speeded is n't a word : d, 
  `` elections '' , probably . 
  but let 's see . 
  ** i 'll translate this one because it 's funny . 
  ** syrian refugee says she does not want to go to romania because it is too cold . 
  `` i come from a warm country , how could i adjust in romania ? 
  i want to settle down in a country with a warm climate '' . 
  the woman is upset because all of europe is interested in taking her picture but nobody is actually helping with anything of substance . 
  ** so , i guess having passed through turkey and greece , germany , denmark or sweden must be warmer climates . 
  : d edit : i wonder what 's going to happen when these people get to germany or denmark or sweden and realize that these states ca n't ** give ** them keys to brand new apartments . 
  and when they realize how much apartments and houses cost in those countries . 
  or that they are simply refugees and they will be ( but not really , germany needs workers ) asked to go back to syria after a few years . 
  meanwhile unemployment in transilvania is 3 % and recruitment agencies for the auto-industry factories say that they would bring in 10 000 new people if they could find them . 
  well if millions are trafficked and the average price is 1000euros , it does n't take a brilliant mind to come up with a sensationalist title :d, 
  no i believe we should have quotas and then set up a refugee stock exchange market to be able to trade effectively . 
  about 6 are underway i believe . 
  upvote for her then . 
  i do n't give a shit . 
  they 're refugees . 
  they do n't get to pick and choose the country that provides the highest welfare . 
  follow the law . 
  if germany offers to take them in afterwards , they can go . 
  if not , the eu will apply redistribution and some will end up in bulgaria and romania and they should be happy and thankful then too , and if not they can go right back . 
  as much as i hate to admit it , he is speaking the truth that other politicians wont ever voice . 
  we are so unaccustomed to hearing normal speech , blunt truths , that we find it a little shocking when he says it . 
  not so long ago i was really hating him with a passion for his anti-eu political views , but now ... a , crap . 
  they already stated that every single person needs to be registered in hungary before moving on anywhere else . 
  it was in a shared press conference with orban just the other day . 
  hungary will also receive funding and it will provide them with visas , probably , to continue their journey after that . 
  it 's irrelevant what they want . 
  only the law is relevant . 
  they 're in a safe country ; they 're being offered food , water and shelter and they need to be registered and given some sort of id . 
  end of story . 
  yup, 
  yup, 
  who is down-voting this ? 
  it was ok to play with peoples emotions before when it was tragic ... why is it not ok now that we know the father is a jerk ? 
  that 's wonderful to read . 
  thank you, 
  are spiegel a bunch of morons or do they not understand that you ca n't let tens of thousands of people to roam the schengen zone without any id ? 
  and the fact that the lack of documentation and travel visas are exactly what fuel human trafficking in trucks across borders . 
  orban is applying the law and registering them as soon as they enter . 
  well at least the children take food even though the adults are clear morons if they think that refusing food will move the police to not apply the law . 
  check my other comment in that post . 
  come on dude , that 's far fetched . 
  do n't worry , hungary is getting the funds it needs from the eu and giving them visas for germany after that . 
  it 's precisely when they move without any documents that human trafficking flourishes because trucks and move across borders unchecked . 
  1 like = 1 $ , 1 share = 10 $ , evidently : d, 
  yes , he is a fucking jerk . 
  you have a problem with my wording ? 
  ** they need to be registered and documented ** and not allowed to roam the schengen zone without any id . 
  i have no empathy for a man tho risks injuring his own baby in protest of being registered as a refugee in a ** safe ** country ( probably the 5th or 6th safe country they have been travelling through , but whatever ; babies are fragile little things if you are n't aware , but you go ahead and defend a jerk ) . 
  hitting your own head with rocks is n't an excuse for the police not to apply the law . 
  they need to be registered and documented before they can travel further . 
  end of story . 
  i am pro-immigration too , but i am not pro-lying . 
  the bbc removed theirs after several hours yesterday , but it was one of the top posts on here . 
  also , shoutout to ** [ euronews ] ( http://www.euronews.com/ ) ** for presenting the scene as it actually unfolded . 
  right here , there was a news post about it . 
  so instead of subsidies , let governments buy a big chunk of the produce and give it away as aid ( in those regions where it does n't negatively impact local farmers ) , such as war-torn syria or afghanistan . 
  here 's one example from the washington post : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jhwwv/hungarys_leader_to_migrants_please_dont_come/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hungarys-leader-to-migrants-please-dont-come/2015/09/03/d5244c6d-53d8-4e82-b9d7-35ec41ca2944_story.html the guardian : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jl5rn/hungarian_police_and_refugees_in_standoff_after/ and somewhere around here we have the bbc links too . 
  but the bbc is a ** publicly funded ** major news organization of a eu member state , altering and presenting misinformation about ** the police force ** of another eu country . 
  that 's not ok . update , here it is : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jlc6j/i_am_posting_this_scene_from_a_different_angle/cuq8wpa an austrian website was using pictures to tell a different story as well . 
  from the video it is obvious that the man grabs his wife and baby and throws them to the ground , not thinking at all about a possible injury to his own child . 
  ** and that is when the police pull him away and immobilize him ** . 
  the hungarian police did n't pull a desperate family from the train tracks they pulled away a man who threw his family to the ground . 
  with regard to the situation as a whole : ** every single refugee or immigrant must be registered and documented in the first schengen country he enters and then given visas for germany . 
  ** ** that is the only way to prevent human trafficking because it is illegal to travel by plane or train without a schengen visa , but nobody stops trucks or cars at the border . 
  hence the tragedy in austria . 
  ** this man was `` protesting '' having to be registered in hungary and not allowed to travel by train to germany or elsewhere , undocumented and unregistered . 
  are we following and applying the law or what ? 
  can we seriously afford to have tens of thousands of people without any id whatsoever , whom we know nothing about , roaming the schengen zone ? 
  ca n't this be fixed by just exporting more ? 
  if there 's too much milk and food production , in europe , there 's plenty of hungry people elsewhere . 
  the eu / french government should buy their products and donate them to turkey and other refugee camps . 
  that way you maintain production , you raise the price of milk and other shit in europe and you keep some refugees from coming here too . 
  it 's win , win , win-ish ... 
  ah shit , looks like you found out that life is shit and unfair and you think you can just post an ironic comment in protest . 
  you mean posting that will fix the problem ? 
  holy f $ % k !, 
  i did n't downvote though , someone else must have . 
  you know there 's a bulgarian minority in odessa oblast and rep. of moldova : p is your government engaging with them at all ? 
  because they seem to be very pro-russia and anti-eu from what i 've heard . 
  well if it does , we can fix our declining population problem . 
  this family alone has 6 children !, 
  yes , and the husband is an engineer with a univ. 
  degree now working in a wood processing company , probably for 300euro/month , almost as if they do n't want to germany , germany . 
  it 's just weird . 
  once they get settled in i hope he finds a job where he can take advantage of his degree though .
