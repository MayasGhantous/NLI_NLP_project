  edit : they are also learning romanian but * personally * i think it would be more beneficial for the children to learn english first , and then some romanian second and not necessarily as intensive . 
  speaking ukrainian and romanian ( very different and both more or less useless internationaly ) and then going for english and german or french is very difficult . 
  i hope i got the wording just right . 
  first i was going for `` great policy '' but that seemed a little too telling , but `` decent policy '' plus a thank you at the end is definitely right on the fence i think . 
  my comment was sarcastic too but i wanted it to be right on the edge so you could n't tell if it was or not and had to sit there and wonder , just in case yours was not sarcastic . 
  i 'm going to downvote because they are using that video again with the description : * hungarian police attempt to remove desperate family from railway lines . 
  * ** in the raw footage from the other angle it is obvious the jerk grabs his wife who is holding the baby and throws them both to the ground and that 's when police pull him away and immobilize him . 
  yup , that sounds like a decent policy . 
  thank you for suggesting . 
  how does that old saying go ? 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  : d seems fitting . 
  ok so 40 000 who did n't get redistributed last time . 
  this time it will be 160 000 and the same fiasco . 
  a few months down the line it 'll be 420 000 : d , on paper . 
  hmm , rename a few regions and villages in eastern europe to `` germany '' , `` deutschland '' , `` bavaria '' , `` berlin '' , `` hamburg '' etc plaster german or belgian flags everywhere and ** they 'll never know the difference ** . 
  just like the other day they got on a train to belgium because it had a `` german '' flag on it . 
  if we had 200 dead on that train , as it would have been except for the gun malfunctioning , today we 'd be having a very different conversation with regard to registering each and every single refugee and illegal immigrant that crosses the border . 
  f#@k human nature . 
  why must something horrible happen every time , before people take the right stance on an issue ? 
  use google translate for the article . 
  it does a great job of translating . 
  apparently renovating each house cost 20 000euro ; all donated by an organisation from sibiu . 
  what ? 
  movie ticket here is 5 euro , popcorn another 1 . 
  good beer in a nice club or bar is 1.5 to 2 euro for the 500ml bottle :p . i hate those small ones, 
  then you 'll fit in here . 
  it teams usually go hiking or mountain-biking . 
  walking at night is quite safe , clubs are full and affordable for these salaries . 
  gas is damn expensive , but car insurance will cost you just 150-200euro / year even for a bigger engine . 
  you 'll take home less here after tax , but you save on other shit . 
  1gbps internet is 10 $ / month and no piracy laws are enforced . 
  4g , 10gb mobile internet and unlimited mobile calls to any networks , 5euro/month, 
  english is definitely a widespread working language and everyone speaks it and development environments are all in english . 
  most people write their code comments in english , including myself ; including commit messages , scrum issues , user stories etc. . . and i 'm working with only romanians on a romanian language project for a romanian client , still , everything is in english . 
  i looked at the full raw video earlier . 
  he takes her and throws her to the ground . 
  if you are seriously considering , you should take a 2-3 day trip to transylvania , unemployment is just 3 % here , or you can go to bucharest , salaries are higher there . 
  romania is a little more messy and unorganized compared to nordic countries so you should see what it 's like first . 
  that being said , romanian cities are full of students and girls are thin and amazing and they like western/nordic europeans . 
  you should consider moving then . 
  you can rent a huge villa in any of the big cities with 7-900 euro / month or the most exquisite studio ap . 
  for 300/month . 
  and there are always way more available it jobs than there are it workers . 
  it 's a serious problem and we already have the highest % of it workers in the eu, 
  are you blind ? 
  her husband grabs her and the baby and literally throws them on the ground . 
  well if such a large groups of men are coming , all the time , without women and children , then we 'll have a social problem on our hands . 
  but , if you look at the pictures and videos in hungarian train station there are definitely plenty of women and children . 
  i would say that when a ** publicly funded ** tv station in one eu country outright lies and manipulates video about ** the police force ** in another eu country . 
  ** it is fucking relevant to europe **, 
  are you on drugs ? 
  it 's quite unbelievable and of breathtaking idiocy . 
  and i regard bbc highly , i would have never believed it without proof . 
  when a major , publicly funded tv station in one eu country outright lies and manipulates video about the police force in another eu country . 
  it is a serious problem . 
  / s dude, 
  agreed : ( i did n't know about turkeys ' proposal . 
  : d now if the eu had an army and could invade their warring home countries and set up safe-zones and arm some of them to fight for the liberation of their own countries ... that would be a very different approach indeed . 
  one major reason ( although not the only one ) is population decline and low unemployment corroborated with wild projections of economic growth due to the extremely low cost of natural resources . 
  which are mostly true , industrialized european countries are headed for amazing economic growth in the next 5-10 years . 
  ** the romanian and bulgarian flow of workers has dried up . 
  ** transilvania has 3 % unemployment . 
  it is way more expensive to move german industry to where other europeans are than it is to just bring in more people to where the infrastructure and factories are . 
  meanwhile , germany has 4.7 % but due to the aging population , 2 % of those could just be 2-4 years away from retirement and thus they really ca n't find a job ( especially if their skills are outdated , they dont have time to re-qualify ) , while another 2 % might be comfortable on welfare or have drug problems or whatever other social issues . 
  so germany is without workers and looking at super low prices of gas , oil and other commodities . 
  if for some reason the syrians dry up we 'll be watching ukrainian work-visas in a few years . 
  but right now , it 's a good excuse for the german government to appeal to emotions and increase the amount of workers , 1-2 years down the line . 
  it 's an easy political sell compared to economic migrants who are seen as taking jobs away from locals and lowering the average wage . 
  i disagree with him and i downvoted . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jhovq/migrants_refuse_to_leave_train_near_hungary_camp/cupfnvj too much eu money and you disrupt the balance in local markets . 
  romanian students live really poorly ; some sleeping 4 - 5 in 1 bedroom . 
  yes , it would be , but we have our own massive migration from rural areas to the cities so our housing situation is not any better . 
  and if the eu pays refugees rent allowance to rent in romania , then rent prices go too high for romanians to afford . 
  we have too few construction workers around to build a whole lot of refugee-only apartments on short notice because our construction work-force is in italy , spain , uk and germany . 
  so if refugee-only apartments would be built , then romanians could n't afford to build new shit . 
  even with the low salaries , ** unemployment in transilvania is 3 % ** . 
  it would be cheaper to house them here , but very disruptive to our markets . 
  the only free houses we have is in the country-side , but those places barely have any tarmac roads , running water , sewage systems . 
  something like 40 % of romanian houses in the country-side do n't have any sewage . 
  edit : there might be room for refugees in small romanian cities . 
  certainly not student-cities because students already live harsh lives here and increasing their rent is a terrible idea . 
  but in small cities where the population has been generally decreasing , there should be room . 
  i 'm just an average web dev and i make 1500e/month in a country where the average is 400/month . 
  it 's not me you should be admiring . 
  that being said , a lot of romanians own their own apartments/houses so rent not as big of an issue as it is there . 
  also , a lot either have worked in western countries and have savings as a result or they have relatives working there who send money back . 
  anyway , it 's not comparable to germany and syrians probably had it better in syria before this whole thing began . 
  for the 1700 refugees romania is going to take the eu is paying 6000e / year for each one . 
  romanians on minimum wage ( and there are a lot of them ) make 200euro / month , so , shit aint completely logical but we 'll take in some . 
  even though , that 's not really a solution to the problem . 
  i never thought i 'd say this , because i do n't like orban due to his nationalistic views , but , thank god for orban . 
  and if i post pictures of religious muslims mistreating their wives to get an emotional response and to change minds ? 
  god , how i would love to have this problem instead of the migrant problem . 
  if only we could move europe right next to china and allow them to colonize eastern european farmland . 
  look at the numbers . 
  a `` detention camp '' ? 
  are you sure you want to call it that ? 
  rent in a romanian city is still 150-200 euro / month for a studio apartment . 
  life is fucking hard here if you do n't own your own place .
