  and it never was going to last because peace and prosperity are not eternal . 
  she failed to create a federal eu just like putin failed to use russia 's resources to develop an actual industry / economy . 
  now they are both paying the price . 
  [ * the eu is fine . 
  despite what some people around here think , i 'm not an unreasonable man . 
  lets look at the double standard , shall we ? 
  dutch ( and german and finnish and other ) popular opinion is against romanian entering schengen so the dutch politicians ignore eu treaties their countries signed and do n't allow romania in because they do n't want to commit political suicide . 
  nobody calls them populists or anything ... 2 . 
  eastern european popular opinion is against immigrants of the muslim variety so eastern european politicians vote against mandatory distribution quotas because they do n't want to commit political suicide . 
  ** the populists !, 
  the dictators !, 
  polish and hungarian democracies are failing !, 
  that does n't mean that i specifically know what i 'm talking about ... :p, 
   we are already a member of the single-currency union in all but name , because bulgaria implements a strict currency board with a fluctuation band of 0 % , effectively outsourcing all monetary policy to the ecb . 
  yes but right now you could still devalue in case of emergency . 
  the trade-off of this safety-net just for being part of the eurozone , is not worth it . 
  not being able to devalue your currency is a national security threat . 
  if you were as developed as germany , the netherlands , france , etc. . . ** and ** they were willing to bail you out if you had a crisis irrespective of why you have a crisis , then we can discuss the advantages . 
  but just because you change your money , does n't mean you change your politicians ; they can still fuck-up because they are corrupt and then the westerners will say ** you did it to yourselves ** , just like they did with greece . 
  the greek people had corrupt politicians too . 
  and westerners will say ... '' * a but bulgarians elected those corrupt politicians so they are to blame , do n't bail them out , they did it to themselves * '' . 
  you and i both know it 's not that simple . 
  is it ? 
  edit : corrupt bankers , government works and politicians in new york fucked up the us economy for 6-7 years , did texans or californians on the other side of the us say : `` fuck em , do n't bail them out they did it to themselves '' ? 
  no , they said , `` those idiots fucked up , but we 've got to bail them out because we ca n't allow 25 % -30 % unemployment in those regions '' ... actually this 2008 crisis is not a good comparison but there is a previous local government bonds crisis the us experienced a few decades ago , ** the municipal bonds crisis ** , which applies perfectly to the situation we have in europe . 
  and the federal government bailed everyone out , of course . 
  ___ instead [ the european parliament is all too happy to change eu regulation and double the allowed amount of pollution from diesel cars until 2020 , when volkswagen fucks up ] ( http://www.euractiv.ro/economic/parlamentul-european-a-votat-pentru-mai-multe-noxe-3457 ) , because germany is in control and germany ca n't let vw employees lose their jobs . 
  of course ... nobody cares if greeks lose their jobs , fuck em . 
  that 's why we have no eu . 
  when the time came to say * fuck it * and help each other regardless of who fucked up there was no european nationalism to justify it . 
  you ca n't build a country on prosperity because it 's not perpetual . 
  you need some nationalism , some european identity . 
  so , you 're going to join a single-currency union with countries like germany who price the euro at a level they decide but wont bail you out when you have a crisis and you do n't have a currency to devalue ... take a good , long look at greece . 
  if you do n't have an army what else can you do ? 
  * we are deeply concerned about russian bombing in syria ... * ____ putin failed to take russia 's natural resources and build a functional economy . 
  merkel failed to take the eu she inherited and turn it into a regional power or indeed a federal state ( because of her adversity to nationalism she would not let a * european * nationalism be born , but that 's just my opinion on why the eu failed ) . 
  bush / obama failed to create a democratic state in afghanistan or irak , but at least they learned their lesson so they 're not even going to try in syria . 
  the last decade has been a decade marked by failed , idiotic leaders . 
  ____ now she wants * nato * to intervene in the region ; she 's a leader trying to command someone else 's army whether it 's the french , british or the american army . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  yes but did she tweet about it ? 
  she should tweet about it ... 
   and i think it 's something to be proud of . 
  and that 's why your country is poor . 
  nationalization should only be an option when you need to save an entire industry or a corporation which is failing because of poor management ( although how much better can public management be , lol ) , which would otherwise be prosperous ; even if a corporation is acting against national interest you threaten nationalization so they get back in line , you do n't actually do it . 
  for the foreseeable future . 
  of course . 
  what you see now is not a weakening of the us but rather a change in strategy ; they 've finally realized that you ca n't invade a place and create a democracy , or invade a place and hold it . 
  hitler and plenty of others made the same mistakes . 
  the us is going to behave more like the roman empire , it 's going to project power through local ~ ~ kings ~ ~ allies . 
  but it 's never going to be challenged by a country where a large % of the people defecate in the streets . 
  give me a break ; india is nothing and will remain nothing because it 's not a single country but a bunch of locally very corrupt governments who only care about their regional power . 
   returning iran 's money you 're saying that as if they were n't under sanctions for years ... edit : if you think global power-struggle is a fair game where people get what they deserve , you 're naive . 
  does n't matter . 
   that is very inefficient . 
  us knows that it will eventually lose the power projection capabilities , both militarily , politically and economically , no , no it wont ... what drugs are you taking ? 
  iranian leaders are really going out of their way to give donald trump plenty of subject matter for his speeches . 
  in all honesty what us leaders should have negotiated instead of just giving money to iran is that they use that money to purchase only shit made in the us ... that way a most of it returns into the economy and gives people jobs , at the very least . 
  but hey , they 're buying airbus and asking for euros ( even though the euro is going to depreciate somewhat in the near future ) so as a european , ca n't complain . 
  let 's hear you say that when your country is under attack . 
  it might be too late for that . 
  no , it is n't . 
  have you lost it man ? 
  the fsb is really in control in russia . 
  not putin alone ; he 's a face and he makes decisions , but the real power is with the fsb . 
  the us does n't want anyone as strong as it because alliances change over time , period . 
  it does n't matter if it 's friend or foe eu or china . 
  us does n't want the eu to be a federal state and have its ' own army . 
  it wants individual states to have armies so they can contribute , but not one single army . 
  it could be that it 's more expensive in the long run for the us to let eu develop into a federal state , build an army and then turn slightly hostile than it is to still keep troops in germany and italy , so they do ... 
  us likes the status quo . 
  i 'm sure . 
  it will be interesting to see how the us balances this without letting russia collapse . 
  if it were to collapse the power vacuum would be filled by eu , turkey , china and japan . 
  i ca n't imagine that being good for the us . 
  suddenly all these potential world powers , massively industrialized , having unrestricted access to russian natural resources , all at once . 
  did not know that ... 
  france has no chance of recovery though ; none . 
  for a country that has airbus , iter , and a whole lot of other amazing shit , you 're doing terribly bad when it fact you should be ahead of germany . 
  and the main reason for that are the disgustingly powerful workers unions which hold france back . 
  i mean , even your taxi drivers are absolutely insane when they protest . 
  your farmers are insane when they protest ( seriously you want to tell me this is a country where massive ethnic violence ca n't happen ? ) . 
  but , the most relevant bit is in fact the welfare state . 
  ** you ca n't have a welfare state and open borders or immigration without integration at the same time . 
  ** ( which is precisely what shows how mentally ill those open-border kids / protesters are . ), 
  here in eastern europe we 're too poor to have a welfare state so nobody is leeching off of working people but in france , the more people you have who do n't want to work or are incapable of working because they 're not integrated ( whether they are immigrants or delusional french anarchists ) , the more expensive it 's going to get . 
  until it all collapses into madness . 
   the difference is we have a somewhat working police , security and justice , that do deal with common rights ( do n't attack your neighbors , do n't harass people etc ) as one of their priority . 
  that and the fact that france is located in the middle of a stable region is why it wo n't slide into full-blown civil war . 
  but perpetual localized ethnic violence is going to keep the `` state of emergency '' as the new normal for a long time to come . 
   you clealry have very limited knowledge about our country . 
  [ manuel valls warns of ` civil war ' if national front wins power ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dbf72940-9feb-11e5-beba-5e33e2b79e46.html#axzz3zwuoju70 ) i 'd laugh , but this is no laughing matter . 
  in ethnically divided local communities where unemployment and crime are high sooner or later tension rises ; it never matters which side started it but the end result is the same . 
  someone commits a horrendous act like a rape or a beating because of race or ethnicity , and eventually everyone is up in arms ready to kill each other . 
  if you think it 's new , you have n't been paying attention to human history . 
  this story is as old as villages and tribes existed on this planet . 
  the fact that you now live in cities , not villages , makes this worse , not easier to deal with . 
  and all the ingredients and early signs are there in french society ; you only need open your eyes . 
  when i write text op posts i document myself and try to stay unbiased . 
  comments on the other hand are here so we can all have a biased conversation .
