  i imagine it would be an even more difficult life than what they were used to in syria . 
  because our people actually work hard instead of leeching on welfare ... http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand.htm but hey , if we 're not wanted there and you 'd like more of the `` new people '' , i 'm sure japan , canada , us or south korea might see our numbers better , and if not , we 'll just work for ourselves ; that 's fine too . 
  german factories pay romanian workers about 300euro / month here . 
  you do the math . 
  screw you , europeans have money to cruise there before asking for asylum . 
  we 're coming !, 
  so what good will refugee quotas be at a eu level if these people only want to go to germany ? 
  you ca n't imprison them in the camps , they will just pick up and go . 
  will it be like a lottery ? 
  where the unlucky ones have to move to romania and bulgaria ? 
  the first video looks like it was filmed with the same potato someone boiled and had for dinner that day . 
  yes . 
  see , i am more extreme than you . 
  i do n't care if people who live in romania learn romanian or not , as long as they speak english and we can communicate . 
  since we need the workforce i would like romania to take in tens of thousands of immigrants and i would n't care if they learn romanian or not . 
  i do n't want to learn the language of every country i 'll end up working in because of my job either . 
  european values and laws are where i draw the line . 
  moreover , despite what you and other people here might assume , because of what i 've written in this thread , i am actually pro-immigration and i support taking in refugees and a eu quota system . 
  but some people here see things as either black or white . 
  * either you claim they 're all good and innocent future europeans or you have an agenda or you 're racist . 
  if you do n't pretend like everything is fucking great then you 're xenophobic or islamophobe . 
  * ** if not wanting to go back on freedom of religion , separation of church and state , gender equality and womens ' rights is islamophobic then i am the biggest islamophobe there is . 
  that is more cringe than i can handle . 
  what does itt stand for ? 
  so many questions , your poor brain must be hurting so much . 
  right now people like you try to find the smallest morsel of explanation other than the obvious ; if you had translation and proof you would claim the rest of us reasonable people must have an agenda . 
  they can do no harm , even if they force women to sit or walk in the back . 
  no harm . 
  we must be tolerant . 
  actually romanians are grateful for being allowed to work in western europe . 
  you do n't get to play that card when there 's no logic in your argument . 
  so some of the men there are either religious nut-jobs or really bad husbands and fathers . 
  correct ? 
  i have my powers of deduction and reasoning , sherlock . 
  ok , enough of this , bye . 
   it could have easily been medicine or something of the sort and they rejected it because they wanted food . 
  seriously , do you have any education at all ? 
  they do n't teach logic and reasoning over there ? 
  how do you do in math ? 
  if i have tired women and children travelling thousands of kilometers with me am i really a father if i turn down food in protest ? 
  more on how religions treat women . 
  but what can i reasonably write back to you when you will try so hard to find the most insignificant morsel of doubt as to what is going on in a video just because you want to believe that everything is pink and merry and happy in the world ? 
  ** if religious fanatics do n't slit your throat , i guess it 's just impossible to know how they feel about you . 
  ** right ? 
  read other comments in this post and you will see it is in fact food . 
  but i guess not a single man there has hungry wife and children traveling with him , right ? 
  being pissed for not being let through and having hungry wife and children are 2 very distinct things , are they not ? 
  [ actually it 's the same fucking organization and it is in fact just a matter of a damn logo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_red_cross_and_red_crescent_movement ), 
  you know what , maybe they force women to walk in the back of the line , behind men , for aero-dynamic reasons not because their religion is unreformed shit . 
  maybe there are some chapters on wind-resistance in the koran which we missed . 
  yes , and i 'm sure ** the border guards are parading the boxes in front of hungry people ** just for laughs !, 
  just like when i feed my cat and i play with her food before i really give it . 
  : ] oh , how much fun those guards must be having . 
  either that or it 's a white-box fashion show and those are all jury members . 
  ** get a grip on reality man . 
  seriously . 
  point is , you are either too stupid or simply unwilling to use your common sense to reasonably determine what is going on in a video if you do n't have a translation . 
  ** i do n't think you are stupid . 
  ** my bet is you are unwilling to accept facts and reality when they do n't conform to your beliefs or what you want to be true ; so you try to leave some room for doubt . 
  which is the definition of irrationality . 
  the boxes must be empty man or filled with office supplies ; those guards are known pranksters ... 
  use your common sense . 
  the red cross filled those boxes to help people in need . 
  so logically it could be medicine or food or clothing , right ? 
  those are people in need . 
  they are refusing them ** as a group ** as if not a single man , woman or child could possibly need what could be in those boxes . 
  does that seem reasonable to you ? 
  or what makes more sense ? 
  that the guards actually tricked them before and gave them some empty boxes and now they 're all shouting : `` you ca n't fool use again you jerks !, 
  we know they 're empty ! '', 
  ** can you seriously not use your reasoning and logic skills to determine what is going on without a translation ? 
  ** * if it was me in that situation i would be waving my hands like a lunatic to get whatever the fuck the [ red crescent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_red_cross_and_red_crescent_movement ) had put in those boxes , to take back to my wife and children . 
  * edit : here 's an idea , maybe this situation ( of muslims turning down free shit because it has a cross on it ) is so old and widespread that the solution was to come up with a new fucking logo . 
  if it had the right fucking logo , then it would have been great . 
  well you are part of the eu , so you better take some . 
  the hallmark of the eu is compromise and working together is it not ? 
  what should the greeks or italians do ? 
  shoot women and children who try to cross the border ? 
  are you seriously proposing that ? 
  of course we should send back economic migrants , but we ca n't let refugees die on our borders man . 
  yes , i 'm sure it is possible that those boxes could be empty . 
  and i 'm sure people in need would turn them away without even knowing what 's inside them , right ? 
  and i 'm sure nobody in that group could possibly need a single thing that could be in those boxes , whether medicine or food or clothing . 
  but fuck , maybe the red cross put nothing but pig meat in them : d but hey , maybe it 's a classic youtube prank channel and those border guards are actually walking around with empty boxes . 
  ** it 's a prank man , look you 're on camera , you 're on camera !, 
  ** you i%#@t . you try so hard to find another explanation that you completely throw logic and common sense out the window . 
  congratulations , you are clueless and you seem to try your best to believe only what makes you feel better . 
  and without such a directive , anyone can fly to europe , refugee or not and have a nice holiday while their application is being processed . 
  i 'm sure all european cities with airports can house and feed for months all the millions of people who would want to fly here and apply for asylum . 
  there 's no way to abuse your proposed system , is there , mr. 
  professor guy ? 
  i 'm sure only actual refugees will board planes to europe . 
  i 'm sure nobody will abuse being able to fly here for 300euro and since you do n't have a legal reason to detain them and ca n't forcefully keep them where you put them , they can just start moving around the schengen area willy-nilly . 
  and his religion/ethnicity ? 
  a mystery ~, 
  last time i checked schengen is a eu construct so it 's the eu who should pay to enforce proper border control . 
  i mean that makes sense . 
  so once the eu pays greece and italy for that , and all of the refugees have documents , then we can talk about redistribution . 
  if that 's the case then why is n't the eu paying greece and italy for enforcing schengen borders ? 
  how can you even have redistribution of undocumented people ?
