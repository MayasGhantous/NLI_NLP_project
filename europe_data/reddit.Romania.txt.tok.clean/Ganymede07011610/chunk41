  explain to me , how does that work ? 
  i do n't know really , it would probably make sense for these country to spend as much as they need to spent and be reimbursed later by the eu since it 's difficult to estimate how much and where money is needed , in this matter . 
  no you i%$@t, enforcing international and eu law would be to send them back to greece or italy but your country wants them badly even though it is incapable of putting forward a legal framework for them to move across eu borders . 
  and neither is your country paying greece and italy enough to enforce proper borders and stop allowing people to enter undocumented . 
  your country is part of the problem . 
  if you want them , get them legally . 
  eu funds , obviously , because schengen is a eu construct . 
  a wonderful one which needs to be protected . 
  greece , italy , spain and other border countries should receive all the funds they need to register every single person , from the eu . 
  edit : ** reinstating permanent border controls everywhere in the eu would be even more expensive anyway . 
  nono , schengen has failed because the people are not immediately registered when they first cross the common border . 
  since they are not eu citizens , they need to be stopped within that country . 
  be it , greece , hungary , italy or spain . 
  but these countries have no interest in doing that and the refugees and immigrants do n't want to stay there either . 
  of course what they want should be fucking irrelevant when it goes against the law . 
  the eu and the dublin treaties are not compatible . 
  that 's the real problem . 
  that 's why we need some sort of redistribution of refugees and deportation of economic migrants . 
  that would at least make sense . 
  what is happening now , is in fact against the law . 
  they do n't have schengen visas and are not eu citizens so they do n't have the right to move across borders . 
  not to mention , so many are crossing and are not registered or checked at all . 
  are some carrying hidden weapons , are some known isis members or former criminals who escaped jail in syria ... we have no clue . 
  and we 'll end up with tens of thousands of people in schengen without any documentation or id cards whatsoever . 
  who are unemployable , you do n't know what their citizenship is , they do n't speak the local language and you have no idea where to deport them if they are not refugees . 
  it 's a complete failure . 
  but you ca n't have redistribution because not all eu member states want it and if you ca n't have 28 state consensus it 's irrelevant that germany wants them , ** when they ca n't actually reach germany legally ** . 
  ** processing centers are needed in the first country of entrance , and germany can take them from there ; with organized trains and buses and most importantly , with documents and id cards . 
  ** that 's why germany has suspended enforcing dublin treaty , but these people are still moving around ** illegally ** and there will be plenty of ex-criminals or economic migrants or even isis members who will avoid being caught and registered because nobody is enforcing proper border control in the first countries of entry . 
  * imagine you have crimes committed by people who do n't exist and are n't registered anywhere ; who are living and hiding with relatives or who can just run from one schengen country to another to avoid police because they do n't have any documents or ids ; how do you prosecute a criminal like that ; ** the police in one country has no way of issuing a european arrest warrant for a non-existent person ** . 
  what do they do ? 
  just ask other police to ** arrest someone who looks like this because we 're lucky to have gotten a low-quality picture ? 
  ** how does that even work ? 
  edit : ** so if i speak the actual truth i get downvoted because i 'm not joining in the `` every single man who crosses the border illegally is a wonderful human being '' circlejerk ? 
  ** immigration is fine and taking in refugees is fucking wonderful but not fucking undocumented , you idiots . 
  edit2 : ** this is also why human trafficking happens because you can drive across borders freely but you ca n't board a train without a visa or eu id card !!!, 
  that 's why 70 people are found dead in a truck in austria , because the eu is n't funding proper border controls in the south and getting documented refugees with legal travel visas after that . 
  you clearly do n't read any of my other comments and just assume anyone who disagrees with you on 1 topic has an agenda . 
  brilliant . 
  goodbye . 
  i 'm not your buddy , pal . 
  how old are you ? 
  if you 're over 20 , then you should act your age . 
  i used to years ago , but i 'm in my 30s now : (, 
  ** attractive ** , non-religious , german-speaking , ideal immigrant , wtf : d it would be more believable if it was an actual family with children like the ones we 've already seen sleeping in trains stations in hungary . 
  why do we need this idealized version of a refugee to make it seem all perfect ? 
  true , but but those stats exist as well even if not in the op . 
  exactly like that . 
  no sarcasm . 
  i have no interest in hiding crimes commited by romanians behind political correctness . 
  it is up to the receiving countries to figure out if the increase in qualified or unskilled work-force is worth the increase in crime . 
  if what you say is true , then good for austria . 
  lets bring in even more people because we will need hardworking men and women ; and i 'm not being sarcastic at all . 
  but policies in holland and sweden have completely failed as proven by those numbers . 
  ethnicity is relevant because it shows an increase in crime correlated with the increase in immigration , my friend . 
  maybe in fact they rioted over the toilet being clogged up !, 
  ok that makes sense ; that 's a valid riot reason . 
  / s : d, 
  those numbers say it very clearly . 
  integration of these people into the work-force has failed and they are leeching off of working europeans . 
  romanian , poles , bulgarians work and pay taxes to support others who do n't . 
  but if you listen to anti-eu political parties in holland and france and the uk , it 's eastern europeans that are the problem . 
  there are plenty of unqualified jobs ( especially in agriculture ) that romanians and bulgarians do which do not require any language skills whatsoever . 
  and you do n't see any romanians or bulgarians in that graph , do you ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahky6hxokzi these romanians do not speak german . 
  syrians are listed there too my dear friend . 
  if you assume i am against them coming , you are mistaken . 
  i am generally pro-immigration and i support taking in as many refugees as we can , ** but not if they just sit on welfare that others work to pay for ** . 
  and holland is not a country where it 's difficult to learn new skills and become a qualified worker . 
  is it now ? 
  for new arrivals there should be welfare and rent assistance , but not indefinitely for people who have been in europe for years . 
  right ? 
  except they 're not . 
  i 'd like to throw a few ( of my own property ) , korans and bibles in the toilet myself . 
  they will happily drink beer and wear lederhosen ever after . 
  personally , i think that you should find a job . 
  brilliant post . 
  you are so right , we ca n't believe we had n't thought of this before ; you are so clever . 
  guys , does n't this put everything in a new perspective ? 
  i ca n't believe it , my thoughts and views on the matter are completely changed . 
  it 's not the eu , it 's germa ... ok , it 's the eu , but uk politicians ( other than farage ) probably want some syrian immigrants as well to add to the workforce . 
  but do n't worry , germany will fight to take most of them . 
  poles , romanians , bulgarians ? 
  they barely ever even mention roma anymore . 
  actually it 's precisely because germany will want to continue to pretend that it is only thinking of helping war refugees that it will try to impose some quotas or policy at a eu level . 
  but probably the policy will mostly focus on helping refugees reach germany . 
  behind the scenes there will be talks of organized trains from macedonia/greece to germany ( because winter is coming and you ca n't let people stay in tents , with small children , in the cold ) and no doubt turkey will be told to let more cross the border into greece . 
  the narrative over the coming months will be that we ca n't let the people already on their way die from winter exposure . 
  which is true , we absolutely can not . 
  so , organized trains in october / november for sure . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6976371/3-01092015-ap-en.pdf/bf970f57-6481-42be-a689-33fd455fa932 i think this speaks for itself ... 
  it 's very expensive to relocate industry from germany to other countries . 
  bringing in more people is far cheaper . 
  yes , they still have 4.7 % unemployment , but out of those , 1-2 % might just be unemployable ( just 2-4 years from retirement but laid off , drug or alcohol problems , social issues etc ) and another 2-3 % might be happy on welfare and might not want to work or , they might not want to work shitty jobs but also do n't posses skills for the jobs they want , or they do n't want to relocate . 
  on paper it will pretend like it is solving things at a eu level and in the media it will sell that to the german people , but what they really want is more middle class refugees . 
  as many as possible . 
  except for that a lot of these people are middle class . 
  they bring with them some savings , their children , various skills and diplomas and once they get settled in they will bring more of their things with them and more family members . 
  the view of economic immigrants , even intra-eu , is that they they jobs away from locals and they bring down the average wage in the country too . 
  people in politics and leadership have to think long-term and they do n't care or see that as a problem ( even if it is true , which some/most times it actually is n't ) .
