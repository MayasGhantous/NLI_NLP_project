  yes , the numbers needed to sustain the ageing population might be ridiculous but in the case of germany it is its ' industry and economic power that guides it 's foreign as well as domestic policy . 
  they will take in ridiculous numbers if they need to . 
  it just so happens that war refugees are an easy sell . 
  pretty much . 
  and russia after that , as the world switches away from oil to solar / wind power and russia is in shambles . 
  remember all those projections made by uk newspapers showing the economy of britain overtaking germany in just a few short decades because of the declining population ? 
  well , they should think again . 
  it 's far cheaper to bring people to where the industry is than to relocate industry across europe to where more people are . 
  but honestly , if regions from north italy to the uk are n't going to share their industry with the rest of europe , then we need fiscal transfer of wealth to balance income inequality . 
  germany is not doing this out of the kindness of it 's heart . 
  germany is desperate for workforce . 
  with a declining population in the coming decades , these people are basically the new germans . 
  the question is if they actually want to be european and german or not . 
  merkel will take in 2-6 million over the next 10 years if she can . 
  this entire situation is nothing short of perfect for her . 
  she needed to fix the dramatically declining population problem and war refugees are so much more easy to sell to the locals than economic immigrants . 
  edit : yes , they will cost a few billions until they settle in , but germany also just happens to have a few extra billions this year ; and after that they will pay for themselves ; construction sector , various industry jobs , etc. 
  too bad it does n't feel as clean or as well kept ; we 've got a lot to improve here . 
  here you go : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rcnq7/number_of_gunshot_victims_in_some_major_nordic/cwmvdt8, 
  it 's this just deaths or injured too ? 
  i 'd like to compare these with romania because i ca n't remember the last time i heard of anyone getting shot here in cluj-napoca . 
  not even by police . 
  edit : apparently it 's gunshot victims / injured . 
  - 14 light injuries - 4 serious injuries - 1 death anyone got newer , more relevant stats ? 
  romanians tend to think that only here measures are taken only ** after ** a tragedy takes place , but really that is the case in the vast majority of countries , with very few exceptions ( maybe switzerland and a few others ) . 
  the deaths are incredibly regrettable and the small good that can come out of this is a reform of the entire safety regulations and their application and control across the country . 
  not taking into account the old communist blocks in eastern europe ( which have recently been upgraded so they look and feel more like new chinese apartment buildings ) , the uk has some of the worst housing conditions anywhere in the eu . 
  those 2 level duplex houses with a parking space in the front and a tiny garden in the back , are the worst in the uk and unfortunately they make up the vast majority of all housing . 
  [ they are so common that all i need to do is to drop a pin in google streetview in a residential area in any uk town and i get this .

  and i 'm sure the prices for these sheds are substantial , but i would not pay money for that . 
  [ whatever my profession is , if i ca n't afford proper housing , i 'd rather take whatever i have and move to eastern poland and be a farmer ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@50.58852,23.2520928,3a,75y,104.75h,86.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sneiucrlwbihqx0-qyt-jpa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro ) [ it does get better in more expensive neighborhoods ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6424649,-0.759432,3a,75y,195.79h,76.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sa4l18obpnu_oqaj9ok80ow!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro ) the uk needs to reform it 's construction sector and given the population density and the expected increase in population size , the only option is to build up . 
  i 'm sure you are giving your wealth away . 
  i 'm sure you are . 
  romanians too, 
  that is ridiculous . 
  lol ; i hope you 're joking ... 
  allow me to be skeptical . 
  well that 's pretty dumb ... 
  really ? 
  it 's not 17 000 euro / year with : housing , food , clothing , policing , healthcare , education , heating , water , electricity , social services , security , transportation , etc etc etc ? 
  it 's not 17 000 / year ? 
  why would i consider anyone from pakistan or nigeria a refugee ? 
  and if you want to think it 's just 17 000 euro , lets do 17 000 x 3 000 000 refugees across the eu and get to 51\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 euros . 
  how much could this amount of money benefit actual refugees in turkey and lebanon and in the safe parts of syria ? 
  actually the figure posted by the bbc is `` up to 23 000 pounds '' per refugee per year for the uk . 
  i extrapolated from that and went with a measly 20 000 euro / year average for the eu . 
  i hope you know that there is a considerably difference in exchange rate between eur and gbp . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34567209 i 'll do you one better , assume just 17 000 euro / year if it makes you feel better . 
  whichever way you look at it , the same money does a lot more good outside of europe , than inside of it . 
  only overwhelmed financially because we spend on average 20 000 euro / year / refugee in europe instead of sending money where it 's needed . 
  and we also spend the same amount on some 75 - 80 % who are not syrians . 
  downvote because the same money we use to provide for them in europe could provide for far more of them in cheaper countries . 
  europe is too cold for them to live in tents and housing is freaking expensive here . 
  so donate construction materials for them to build their own houses in warmer countries . 
  : ) you know , something the 80 % males could stand and fight for / defend ? 
  the secular society with a government free from religious influence they all dream of when they come here ; and they can take up arms to defend !,

  does she not comprehend that there is an unlimited supply of people who would request asylum in europe ? 
  so whether it 's just sweden that collapses or we all do is only a question of numbers . 
  and the number is definitely high enough to collapse all european countries , not just sweden .

  oh , it already has . 
  you need to read more about romania . 
  whats the point of biking if there are still traffic jams ? 
  if i 'm in a traffic jam ill be in my car , thanks . 
  law is a difficult field to find a job in . 
  in many countries there are too many law graduates . 
  best advice i can give you is to think and plan long-term no matter what you do . 
  got it , np ... 
  and how lucky we are to have you ; to hell with downvote buttons i say . 
  what makes traffic jams unique and specific to turkey or russia ? 
  why do n't you go and remove all the `` daily commutes '' images too ? 
  they are low effort and i 'm sure you 've got traffic jams in country too . 
  so it 's unoriginal and low quality . 
  i do n't care to argue anything . 
  if you are in charge here , do as you will . 
  i do n't care about any points or karma , i just shared something from my country which i found interesting . 
  how about the 32 upvotes and 92 % upvote ? 
  if it 's such low quality content why did people vote it up so ? 
  or is there some sort of pumpkin brigadeering at work ? 
  i 'm really not happy with this . 
  : / we 've got downvotes so people can downvote low quality content , not moderators to remove posts . 
  what you may or may not have seen in your region is irrelevant . 
  others have n't seen it , let them see it too . 
  this was made in a romanian farmers market ; just because some canadians made a similar one does n't mean it 's got nothing to do with romania . 
  if anything , this creation looks a lot more like romanian folklore monsters , than any regular halloween pumpkin i 've ever seen , but even if it did n't , it 's not low quality . 
  hence the upvotes . 
  its unique content on reddit so people vote it up . 
  just because your are a moderator you think you can remove anything you want ? 
  the post is 92 % upvoted .
