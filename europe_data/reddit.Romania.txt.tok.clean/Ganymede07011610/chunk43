  have you lost your mind ? 
  how about another `` euromaidan '' . 
  we send our army in , you send yours in transnistria , we shake hands across the dniester and call it a day ? 
  it 's pretty obvious that there 's no other future for this country . 
  edit : in return we become the first nato country to recognize crimea ( sorry ukrainians but you know you 're never really getting it back anyway ) and transnistria as part of russia ; it becomes a win-win . 
  well , shit ... 
  the prosperity of our entire continent depends on the automotive industry . 
  : ) `` too big to fail '' does n't even scratch the surface ... 
  is anyone surprised ? 
  europe depends on this industry . 
  so well put !, 
  that was such a moronic display of `` german angst '' ... 
  when an insanely strong and rare earth-quake causes a tsunami which destroys a single nuclear plant in japan , germany , a country with no earth-quakes and no tsunamis renounces all nuclear power . 
  i am , at heart , a federalist so these are not questions i spent any amount of time pondering . 
  and i am also , pro-immigration ; i would accept hundreds of thousands or millions of immigrants into romania , provided i have a say in picking and choosing them . 
  given recent ( the past 3-4 years , not just the refugee thing ) events , i think poland will pull v4 together like never before and try to influence eu politics from within . 
  i think the dream of a federal eu is gone and instead we 'll see little islands of unity , such as v4 , the baltic states and the balkan states in the east , where generally we will all enter orbit around warsaw because of similitude in foreign policy . 
  if we ca n't all feel european , and my german and austrian friends here treat me like 2nd class scum who can be denied schengen with impunity , the eu will stay afloat for as long as some money keeps flowing and only for as long as the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . 
  nobody will leave `` with us '' . 
  that implies that romania can be a leader of that magnitude , which it ca n't . 
  romania can set an example in things like , anti-corruption , but poland will lead if it comes to that . 
  * also not adding another country to schengen at the heigt of the refugee crisis seems very sensible . 
  * not complying to an idiotic immigration policy seems very sensible to me . 
  it 's not an * ad hominem * attack . 
  you are a hypocrite if you want to impose immigrant quotas out of solidarity with the schengen zone , while at the same time denying us schengen membership . 
  if we leave , we leave as a unified eastern block . 
  not as any one individual country . 
  you are wrongfully denying us schengen for the past 3 years you hypocrite . 
  i can not believe you have the audacity to lecture me on why i do n't need a right you enjoy and you wrongfully deny to me . 
  * from moving to germany and earning 7-8 times more * so keeping the periphery countries poor benefits german , austrian etc economy . 
  i get hung up on the money because the average wage in romania is 7 or 8 times less than germany while you are still allowed to export your products here , tax free . 
  and now you want to export immigrants forcefully too . 
  ** while you continue to block schengen for us ** . 
  you people are at the height of hypocrisy . 
  * other countries * , so not a federal state . 
  so i can say no to immigrants . 
  correct ? 
  federal state =  immigrant relocation , schengen and fiscal redistribution . 
  political union =  sovereignty and some measly funds . 
  that 's how this works . 
  i will never accept the disadvantages of a federal state , without the advantages . 
  fiscal redistribution or i 'll have none of this . 
  like i already said ; that is nowhere near enough to give up sovereignty over . 
  i expect to see fiscal redistribution before i even hear about any imposed immigrant quotas . 
  i do n't want to be part of any solution that fails to see that the purpose of borders is to stop people from crossing into our countries . 
  the entire purpose of having borders is precisely the same reason for having a fence around my property . 
  ** so we can pick and choose who we let in and who we keep out ** . 
  besides , the money you so arrogantly claim to find better purposes for , you would not have if the rest of the eu would not be buying your products . 
  so do n't pretend like you are some great benefactor or philanthropist . 
  the eu is sending a measly 3-4 bln euro / year to romania . 
  what the f is that ? 
  we could counter-balance that just by imposing an import tax on german goods and keep more of our own money in our country . 
  we are not a federal state and a lousy 3-4 bln / year is not fiscal redistribution ; certainly not enough for you to claim sovereignty over me . 
  i refuse to be part of her `` solution '' . 
  if she continues to impose her `` solution '' , i 'm going to vote for whichever party takes my country out of the eu . 
  what are you going to do about it ? 
  do you want the eu ? 
  then stop . 
  do you want to put an end to the eu ? 
  then continue . 
  but remember that when trade barriers and import / export taxes go up again , germany is going to be the main loser , by far . 
  are you going to call everyone east of berlin a racist for not willingly succumbing to your ridiculous immigration policy ? 
  so what if you do ? 
  calling someone a racist and expecting to impose a guilt-trip and auto-win any argument only works on westerners . 
  i do n't f !, 
  ! ~ #g care ; i want what is best for me and my country . 
  i want tolerant , easy to assimilate immigrants , and just like i can pick and choose who i let into my home , i will pick and choose who i let into my country . 
  it 's pretty stupid is n't it ? 
  all of this can be solved at sea and near the bulgarian , greek / turk border . 
  that 's where schengen broke , not between austria and slovenia . 
  what 's more , it 's fucking infuriating that `` cooperation and solidarity '' is imposed by merkel only in terms of `` sharing '' immigrant quotas , but not in protecting borders where it makes sense . 
  certainly , but a lot of us have to work too . 
  : \\ the way you linked your sources was not helpful at all . 
  the figure has been widely available since september . 
  perhaps if the mods around here reduced the amount of pro-refugee censorship we 'd get somewhere . 
  [ euro-f % ~ ! # & g-stat ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/19/eu-statisticians-claim-only-1-in-5-migrants-are-from-syria-5398412/ ) learn to google next time . 
  breath-taking hypocrisy . 
  that 20 % figure is official . 
  look it up . 
  i 'm not going to go through documents containing hundreds of pages to see what you 're on about . 
  it was the imf that lent money to eastern europe in 2009 . 
  that 's all i remember . 
  the idiot merkel is imposing the same medicine for patients with completely different conditions . 
  austerity might help spain and greece in the long term , but there is no reason to hold back romania and poland and bulgaria who need to borrow to return to 6-7 % yearly growth . 
  but i 'm not surprised because that b & !, 
  * h does n't care about income inequality and poverty and growth at the level of the eu . 
  if she did she would acknowledge that we have people living in extreme poverty in the eu . 
  and exempt helping them from the deficit first and foremost . 
  it 's quite disturbing . 
  so , austerity for european citizens is mandatory but it comes to providing welfare for others ( i repeat , only 20 % syrians ) , rules are overlooked . 
  the same austerity rules preventing countries like poland , romania to borrow money to develop faster . 
  i really hate this eu . 
  i hate merkel and juncker . 
  especially merkel could n't bend the rules even a little bit when it came to 20-27 % unemployment in spain and greece . 
  fuck that woman . 
  i am also a romanian start-up but we do n't provide any services which require high traffic ; it 's difficult to explain , but i trust our isp to offer us more than fair deals , no matter what our requirements are .
