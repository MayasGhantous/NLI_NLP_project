  ** ** you are the worst leader ** . 
   and we are willing to get paid less . 
  this is the main , if not the only reason , german industry has moved east , to some extent . 
  but they have little or no intention of raising wages or quality of life in the east to be on the same level as the west , because they enjoy both the workers coming from here , as well as the workers who live here . 
  you 're right , we might not have the capacity to get them to do it , and even if we all threaten to leave the free-market as a block we might only get a few concessions ... 
  still , as the entire world economy slows down , it is becoming increasingly likely that germany will have an export crisis ; if you take a look around the world , can you point to any region which could buy their products in the volume that they produce them ? 
  so in order to export , they 'll need to lower the end price of their products , which means that even if they have a massive crisis and unemployment in their country , we 'll be ok since they need the cheap parts . 
  it is at this point that i hope poland ( v4 ) will replace germany as the * de facto * political and ideological leader of europe ; because having a self-hating leader is detrimental to us all . 
  i am responding to someone who brought up ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ illegal immigrants , in a thread about public debt . 
  i am perfectly willing to share the `` refugee '' risks and costs with germany and all other eu countries , as long as the solution is not to let in millions of illegal immigrants , but to build safe-zones , defend them and donate construction materials and equipment so they can rebuild their lives in their own country and culture . 
  instead germany is spending 50 billion euros on just 1 million , out of the 10 million syrian refugees and donating another 3bln to turkey . 
  that is absurd and it only goes to show that merkel does not care about the well-being of these poor people . 
  she is helping only the ones who risk their lives at sea and pay 1-5000 euro to people smugglers / human traffickers because she wants more cheap workers . 
  all the deaths at sea , are on her ; blood on her hands . 
  how absurd is it that germany when confronted with population decline , does n't move its ' industry to countries where europeans are either unemployed or underpaid , but instead brings in illegal immigrants . 
  if ever there was a sign that the eu is not now and not ever going to be a federal state , this is it . 
  this is how german leaders think . 
  they do n't want a unified europe , they do n't want prosperity and a good life for europeans , they want powerful german corporations with an open market to sell to everyone . 
  that 's it . 
  if you do n't share risks , then every single crisis we 're going to have , starting with the sovereign debts crisis , the crisis in ukraine , the `` refugee '' crisis and any other that 's coming our way in the coming years , is going to tear the eu apart , bit by bit . 
  and if you think otherwise , you have no understanding how states are formed . 
  edit : whether you like it or not , you need some level of european nationalism , because sooner or later there will wars ; wars are inevitable and when push comes to shove if a spaniard feels no reason to fight alongside a pole , or a romanian feels no reason to fight alongside a frenchman in mali for example , then we do n't have a federal state . 
  we have nothing . 
  and so far , germans were not willing to join the french in mali , particularly because they are so weak and think they can solve everything with * sanctions * . 
  well you ca n't ; sometimes you need a military and you need to use it . 
  it is becoming increasingly evident that germans do n't want a federal state with equal prosperity for all its ' people but instead want to continue to have a strong germany at the center of a free-market . 
  thus , the sooner germany has a crisis and steps down as eu leader , hopefully replaced by poland , the better . 
   is designed to prevent any form of risk-sharing between euro-area countries and to confine the costs of fiscal and financial instability primarily within the more fragile countries . 
  more steps towards the death of the eu . 
  idiotic german leaders ... if peoples do n't share a common fate and common risks , we 'll never have a federal europe . 
  being part of a united europe ** has ** to mean that all its ' citizens are subject not only to the same rewards but also to the same risks . 
  whether it 's financial risks or geopolitical / military risks . 
  in other words , the eu would be turning more and more into a sterile mechanism for countries to act in their own interest , within the same union . 
  if that 's the case then we need to abolish the eu parliament since it 's nothing more than a massive drain on resources . 
   in the end it 's not like a country with not even half the gdp of belgium is going to cause much headache . 
  everyone east of germany , austria and italy feels the same my dear friend . 
  everyone . 
  if we threaten to leave , we 'll do it as a block . 
   it 's not as if former dutch truck drivers are happy with all the romanians here . 
  yet another reason why your government does n't want eastern europe to develop and pay decent wages to * truck drivers * here for example . 
  call me whatever you want , you seem a little delusional or have a bit of a messiah complex . 
  kind of person not willing to stay in a free-trade union with countries who export so much it hurts the development of my region ? 
  you bet i am . 
  just like you 're the kind of person who feels like you owe us nothing when in fact some things are so unfair only fiscal redistribution can make them fair again . 
  such as there being a single job market for doctors , and public systems of very rich and very poor countries competing for hiring doctors on the same market . 
  that is fucking absurd , when the romanian tax payer is placed in competition for medical services with the dutch tax payer . 
  but sure , you keep thinking that i 'm the one who is not virtuous enough to be in this shit union . 
  then we 'll exit the eu as soon as you cut funds . 
  you owe us plenty , both morally and economically since we 're in a free trade zone with countries who produce and export literally everything . 
  otherwise how do you suppose we can becomr `` competitive '' when we neighter have the capital , nor the tax on imports to protect local businesses from western products ? 
  honestly , in the face of western stupidity , as an atheist / anti-theist , i am ready to become a religious conservative if that 's what it takes to stop this madness . 
  ideological views , of course . 
  think about it , we 're in a union with mammoth industrial countries who , when faced with population decline choose to import millions of new people , instead of sharing their industry with unemployed and underpaid europeans . 
  let 's make a deal with the us if they 'll build something over here . 
  edit : i mean , just think about about it , germany is going to spend 50 bln euros , this year and the next just for the immigrants they have taken last year . 
  with that kind of money you : 1 . 
  use 5-10 bln to secure the european borders / coasts . 
  donate 10 bln to turkey , 10 to other countries near syria housing refugees . 
  you 're still left with 20 bln euros to develop infrastructure in europe . 
  with 20 bln in aid for some 10 mln displaced syrians that comes to about 10 000 euro / family consisting of 5 syrians , 2 parents and 3 children . 
  is n't that mind-boggling ? 
  instead germany is spending billions for housing , feeding , clothing , policing , etc. . . for people whom 70 % are n't even syrians but come from africa , afghanistan and pakistan , and other countries . 
  then merkel comes on tv and says that `` refugees have to go back when the war is over '' ... mostly north africans , pakistanis and afghans have to go back when the war in syria is over ? 
  what the hell is wrong with this woman ? 
  you almost say that as if it 's a bad thing ... 
  when western and northern europeans wo n't share their industry with unemployed and underpaid southern and eastern europeans , of course you 're going to look for a better deal . 
  not really , airbus planes are already built all across western europe and they 're still profitable . 
  also , bombardier do a good job of that ; opening factories where governments offer them large contracts . 
  i doubt they would continuously do it if it was n't profitable . 
  look it up . 
  what poland is saying to western europe is , * share the industry * . 
  germany does n't need more workers to supplement the population decline , it needs to move its ' factories around and give jobs to ** europeans ** of whom we 've got plenty either unemployed ( 20-25 % , 46 % among young europeans in some countries ) or poorly paid ( eastern europe ) . 
  i can promise they 're not staying in eastern europe . 
  hope your wish comes true . 
  excellent . 
  you take them all . 
  edit : lol , wait what ? 
  are you a misogynist / sexist ? 
  if that 's the case in your country and men are more attractive for employers your new guests will feel right at home , i 'm sure . 
  5 of 6 pictures showing women and children . 
  fine !, 
  for the love of god , take women and children then but keep single men out . 
  germans , still struggling with acquiring a sense of humor . 
  the search continues . 
   but just imagine it without them . 
  why would i do that ? 
  am i a moron ? 
  you are defending the proposal by completely taking out of context . 
  i am not an idiot to not see what you are doing . 
  no , not all germans are weaklings , but in general , german society has become one made up of weaklings and you have no business being a leader , when you hate yourselves . 
  last time i checked neither the chinese nor the japanese had an assimilation and integration problem into european culture and way of life . 
  my dear german friend , imagine that i 'm about to speak very slowly : what you need to understand is that those of us in the east have no more patience to be lead by such a culture of weaklings and pushovers that the germans have become . 
  over the next few years weigh your words and your actions very carefully if you still want to have a european union which goes further than the german - polish border . 
  edit : not everything is about money , in this increasingly disgusting world we live in . 
  please do n't waste your time threatening to cut eu funds or telling me that we 'll never be as rich as you ; that might not be the case , but you might eventually be as poor as us . 
  honestly , the sooner the germans step aside and let poland lead , the better . 
  hopefully the upcoming exports crisis will do just that . 
  assimilating the local population into the culture of immigrants ... what will german scientists think of next !, 
  oh , come on , do we seriously even need to teach german anymore ? 
  so few people speak it anyway it 's not really an international language .
