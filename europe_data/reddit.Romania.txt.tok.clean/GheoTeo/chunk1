we have a lot of bears around brasov that put a slight dent in the turist population . 
  maybe she is from around here . 
  succint . 
  really nice but it is easily comparable to the our local bran region and it is usually clogged with cars , not caravans . 
  so ... it is the same kinda thing ... almost . 
  and i 'm at my 8th beer . 
  no stereotypes please . 
  accurate . 
  i was in a horse-drawn taxi last week . 
  this stirred the heart a bit ... 
  yep . 
  mothers are quite the verbal battling ground around here :p, 
  actually everybody around here swears using god and various saints . 
  we used to say around here that priests swear the best because they know all the saints . 
  examples . 
  `` fuck your christ '' `` fuck your gods '' `` fuck your church '' and other colourful ways of expression . 
  i heard the rumours about a ressurection or something . 
  you might not read all this , but i 'm optimistic today . 
  moving people is a different thing and it has been done historically everywhere . 
  during the communist regime people moved around the country to adapt to the changing of possibilities . 
  people moved from one part to the other because the job alocation worked differently ( everything was alocated by the state ) . 
  my family is from curtici ( arad ) , in the west , but they moved to brasov in the 60s because this is were they were given jobs ( you know everybody worked for the government back then ) . 
  and of course , it was an opressive regine and they did what they want in the end . 
  but they were not the first and they will not be the last.anyway , regarding the movement of people , in the same period a lot of moldavians migrated to transylvania due to the fact that there were more available jobs at that point . 
  if we go back in history the reason we have a hungarian minority is because they were ** moved ** here by the hungarian kingdom in the region to act as border guards . 
  with them they brought the saxons as well which are today the transylvanian saxons . 
  ( the colonization of transylvania by germans was begun by king g\u00e9za ii of hungary ( 1141 -- 1162 ) ) even the forebearers of the hungarians ( huns ) were ** moving all the time ** . 
  but ethnic cleansing is a different approach . 
  what you are talking about is the romanisation of the ethnic minorities which meant changing names and forcing the learning of romanian , not killing and eliminating the members of the culture altogether . 
  indeed , the communists are not a good example for many things , but they tried to convert not cleanse . 
  if you want to explore the idea of ethnic cleansing as it is ( [ wik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing ) i ) , it implies much more brutal measures . 
  it happened in turkey , in russia , even here during the wwii ( it was limited but it happened ) . 
  the rwandan massacre was about etnhic cleansing . 
  now , we have a lot of information regarding this region in the last 1000 years but you must make a difference between the general lines approached by history school books and complete history books . 
  indeed there some things that are not teached and it is better in a way . 
  how would you explain to a 15 year old the centuries old conflicts in the region without a proper context ? 
  actually this usually happens because there are a lot of people who think you should tell them everything . 
  and that 's why i had to argue with a guy from the south that , no , the hungarians will not invade transilvania . 
  so , as a conclusion , yes , there are things that do n't show up in common school history books but the history is there for anyone to read . 
  everytime this is brought up , either from the romanian side or from the hungarian side , there must some battle , or assasination , or cleanse , or insult that one side did to the other . 
  but all that should be behind . 
  should i not trust my colleague even if his name is arpad ? 
  i trust him , because of who he is not because is a specific etnicity . 
  the moment i devolve to stereotyping based on etnicithy then that when i start to sound like the last 100 years were for nothing . 
  so read the history because its interesting and respect the people around you because that is what matters . 
  bonus history : the szekely minority fought alongside the romanian kingdoms since 1200 until 1870 . 
  including for mihai viteaul ( michael the brave ) in the battle for selimbar ( 1599 ) .

  [ romanian pizza ] ( http://imgur.com/kcpux5t ) we call it `` pizza cu mititei '' . 
  these are the [ mititei ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/401/721/27241/12394791/1/mititei.jpg?width=290 ) . 
  romanian `` manci nu manci , eu tot o dau la porci '' which means `` may food find you well '' and i find it beautiful . 
  that image is strangely familiar ... 
  we 're poor , ugly , illiterate and idiots . 
  [ we are unable to do anything ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_romanian_inventors_and_discoverers ) . 
  we just exist in order to leech of other people 's money .

  the flag of my city . 
  you can see [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/rou_bv_brasov_flag_historical.jpg ) our stalwart 3 remaining guards carrying it while protecting an ancient wall . 
  i think it 's germany . 
  i 'm not talking about world wars here . 
  the most productive region of romania is transylvania and it was shaped by transylvanian saxons . 
  hell , the city i live in is also named kronstadt . 
  because of our local saxons the links we have with germany are far and wide . 
  our first beer is from them , first trains , first roads , first phones , etc. 
  i do n't even think there are any jokes at the expense of saxons/germans . 
  i even work for a german company  . 
  yep , it 's germany . 
  we also have the serbians , poles and french ... but deutschland ist \u00fcber ihnen . 
  romanian swearing actually more like romanian flirting in some areas from that i 've encountered . 
  [ ca n't get any more romanian than this ] ( http://dantomozei.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jackie-chan-ziyi-zhang-in-romania-11-septembrie-2014-c.jpg ), 
  not really . 
  this is the most balkan thing from home http://i.imgur.com/3dczvfu.jpg, 
  shaworma - check kebab - check at least one alcoholic relative - check nationalistic - check love/hate relationship with neighbours - check same insults - check half of the food is turkish - check shitty softcore porn music on turkish rythms - check yep . 
  we 're in the balkans . 
  why is brasov getting the shaft ? 
  it should be bucharest . 
  i should get a cat ... 
  you sure ? 
  if so , then its a good one :-), 
  not really no . 
  the guy just woke up and contested a law that forbids persons that have been sentenced to ever hold a public office , because the guy leading the largest party in the country , which just won , is condemned for electoral fraud in a referendum . 
  and he most likely he has his fist up the ombudsman ass and works him like a puppet . 
  honestly , it 's gon na be a very bleak couple of years at least . 
  he is the [ ombudsman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ombudsman ) and he is charged with representing the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints of maladministration or a violation of rights ... at least in theory for the one appointed in romania . 
  well , the article just says that we kinda really suck at doing things despite getting a lot of money from the eu , mainly due to corruption . 
  we had much less social and economical development despite getting a over 40 bln euro in non returnable funds . 
  so ... yeah . 
  potato casserole ... caserole is a kind of pot for us . 
  so its potatoes in a pot ... and we got plenty of recipes for that . 
  my favorite are [ accordion potatoes ] ( http://img.kudika.ro/images/article_pictures/back/shutterstock_167425682.jpg ) or these [ bad boys ] ( http://savoriurbane.com/cartofi-copti-cu-smantana-la-cuptor/# ), 
  7 eur prepay card on vodafone romania . 
  unlimited calls/sms . 
  20 + gb of 4g traffic, 
  with the exception of a very spiritual minority , people under 60 around here just go to church for weddings , baptisms and funeral . 
  no other reasons to go really . 
  [ glorious romania in the house ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3dczvfu.jpg ), 
  us too . 
  i do n't remember the last time i payed to see a movie online . 
  my native romanian , then english french and barely passable german . 
  but i know how to swear in hungarian , greek , bulgarian , russian , spanish , polish , czech and a wee bit in finnish .
