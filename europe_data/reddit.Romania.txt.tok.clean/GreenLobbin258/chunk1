it would probably take charge , but i do n't think members of the eu army would accept fighting someone else 's war . 
  defense is one thing , colonies another . 
  you do n't need a conflict or a reason to build up an army . 
  you use it for deterrence . 
  you can spend as much as you want on an army , the only thing you need is to defend , deter , and save against any outside forces . 
  an army is useless if it ca n't defend efficiently . 
  if you ca n't defend quickly you increase the chances of a hit-and-run . 
  the reason the eu army is a good idea is because it will be faster , more efficient in collaboration and better collaboration in industry and tech . 
  why would the eu army get thrown around by the french ? 
  if you wait for an instance where you need an army you have already failed . 
  an army is a prevention force , the better the army , the better the prevention . 
   why are n't we continuing to pursue our policy of peace , we do n't deserve peace if we ca n't maintain it . 
  if we get attacked we need a quick and effective response with a cohesive army , not a bunch of rag-tag armies with 2-3 real armies . 
  he set a condition for protecting a country in a defense treaty , he created an instance , a chance , a small risk of russia expanding into europe and the us not batting an eye . 
  he said all the dumb stuff trump will get more worldwide coverage . 
   god forbid trump ever gets into office , the world will explode , everyone will die , aahh !, 
  that sounded pretty dickish . 
  justin trudeau did do some pretty weird stuff . 
   swastikas rising  in times of expand o , rly ? 
  the way i see it , globalism is like a steamroller you get steamrolled or you fight for a seat in it . 
  people already globalize with the internet . 
  they 're the biggest for us , hence the hate . 
  i think he only ** really ** feels he needs to shit on russia and say everything bad happening in the world is their fault . 
  people could argue that those do n't bring anything positive . 
  stalin 's come to britain . 
  islande makes more sense than iceland . 
  i mean it 's an island but is n't covered in ice like greenland ( also , groenland is better than greenland ) . 
   or to put it another way , the only people actually directly elected by eu citizens are the ones with less control over the legislative process ? 
  / u/fuchsiamatter first sentence was :  the legislator in the eu is the ep and the council . 
  they are both elected . 
  i have no idea what 's going on right now . 
  a thing happens in an european country related to european funds , a person posts it on the european subreddit , it gets upvotes ( and the country 's citizens usually come too ) . 
  is this not normal reddit behaviour ? 
  you added something that made it slightly more scummy . 
   should just downvote all these threads . 
  the germans want the r/europe subreddit to be only about central europeans , * just like hitler . 
  *  quick !, 
  one hour 's quick enough . 
  that 's `` fata '' , without \u021b . 
  i 'm still confused , did it say second brexit or second independence referendum ( and was it after brexit ) ? 
  i did n't see the article , only heard of it . 
  would n't nato then become the us , canada , uk , eu , etc ? 
   and about respecting the will of minority groups . 
  will ? 
  rights would work better . 
   who will the european army take orders from ?? 
  [ the european defence agency ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_agency ), 
   juncker as chief commander [ more like the european defence agency . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_agency ), 
  u/mbdave made [ a pretty good case for it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51gd6r/europe_forges_ahead_with_plans_for_eu_army/d7byuod ), 
  nato does n't stop countries from attacking each other . 
  the only reason greece and turkey did n't declare war over cyprus was because of pressure from the us and eu . 
  oth winston churchill wanted to create and us of europe that included germany so there would n't be another world war . 
  eu countries would n't attack each other because they have intermingled trade and it would n't end up being worth it . 
  would that be because of country 's ideology or corruption ? 
  are we going to deny the fact that nk is communist because they 're a dictatorship and not anarchic ( it 'd be quite hard to enforce equality without the intervention of the government ) ? 
  they still live in equality : extremely poor , shit rights , no one owns anything ( so everyone owns everything if you twist it enough ) . 
  soon we 'll be an expat country , natives leave , foreigners come , they 're both expats . 
  of course , but the moldovans could ~ ~ can ~ ~ change opinion quite fast if there ever comes a crisis , or complete distrust of the moldovan institutions , or transnistria and russia attack it . 
  but now in the status quo we need to wait for the support until the unification . 
  [ here are some polls . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_romania_and_moldova#public_opinion ), 
  there 's nothing out of the ordinary with them , they 're normal white europeans . 
  it 's hard to talk about a country 's culture , you learn only differences between the cultures . 
  there are city people that reminds of the west ( although we might louder and more stressful ) , the average towns people which are poorer , village people that practice subsistence farming , from here comes the poor romania memes where there are no waterworks , just outhouses and wells , but have internet . 
  also , we 're very religious and quite conservative . 
  a difference that 's easily noticed is the fact that the poor choose to be villagers and farm and tend to animals rather than beg , but there is the fact that they might choose to stop their child from going to school to help on the farm but the government has been trying to make it easier to improve ( you need to finish 10 classes to be employed , so the parliament has made changes like there being a 0 grade and moving the 9th grade from high school to grade school so the village people do n't have to send their children to the city at the high school to get employed ) . 
  we 're basically what you 'd expect of europe , but slightly poorer . 
  there are a lot of differences , they are similar to gypsies from other countries , they like to segregate each other from mainstream society by refusing education and normal work , they have their own : language , society , traditions , traditional clothing and obviously skin colour . 
  there are instances where a gypsy chooses to leave his group and go back into society , but there 'll be a lot of resentment to each other ( * how dare you shun us * and * i ca n't believe they choose to remain like that * ) , after they leave they 're not that different to other people except for the skin colour , you ca n't change that . 
  tl ; dr basically everything . 
  they recognize their actions as their own ? 
  yep . 
  red seen as angry , active while blue calm , quiet . 
  the people killed were also gypsies , they were untermensch to the nazis . 
  since there 's no controversial romania option i 'm just going to assume they like us ... 
  how about [ a 100 year old totally-not-hohenzollern vampire ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_i_of_romania ), 
  i find it nice you are n't bothered they have a child ( moldova ) , but i think she 's quite a busy lady lately and does n't have time to fool around . 
  no no no , the dacia is shared , we ca n't steal something we 're sharing , 
  ohh ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  to be honest , they 're mostly noisy and act brazen . 
  i have n't heard many news of them doing anything that horrible near me . 
  it all depends on : poverty , police corruption/indifference and education . 
  there 's been one instance that appeared on the news lately : in a remote village where they made literal house slaves ( roma ) . 
  the idea seems a little infant at the moment to be that relevant . 
  continue the sanctions ? 
  and there 's no way to stop them from becoming more relevant , it 's normal what happened . 
  becoming more integrated increases our potential , even though it might 've slowed us down for a bit . 
  we 're losing impact because china and other countries became richer faster , the eu is still growing . 
  china does n't exist anymore . 
  even on the gradient neutral is different from the ocean . 
  i 'm sorry to tell you this bulgaria , but ... 
  there are controversies with how australia deals with refugees , with a high percentage of child abuse even though there are n't that many children compared to adults . 
  i 've started looking at it after [ seeker 's video on it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtv84zkhq8u ) . 
  the only countries in the eu that `` hate '' each other are romania and hungary , croatia and slovenia ( even though they do n't really ) . 
  i think the eu would end up funding the eu armies . 
  for example : germany has won a nato competition with the best tanks , but they have a small unimpressive army , while the eastern eu have a lot of people with shitty militaries ( the romanian navy is a joke even though it 'd be needed in case of an attack from the black sea ) .
