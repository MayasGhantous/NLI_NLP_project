  dat bloody baby handjob ( this sounds extremely wrong , but fuck it ), 
  would romania become hungary , turkey ( only dobruja occupied ) , poland ( moldova was vassal ) . 
  you 've managed to make it even more confusing , great job !, 
   its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the roman empire ( ancient greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr . 
  [ that 's right babyyy !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire ), 
  by whom ? 
  i think that when saying human trafficking you invoke the idea that those people have lost their rights , but they were actually gaining rights to another country . 
  but , speaking of human trafficking , we 've discovered today 40 slaves in romania . 
  the news will travel soon . 
  there are a lot of xenophobic people everywhere , but i think that guy censored himself from saying gypsy . 
  [ `` because we do n't want to look like a filthy romanian or something '' ] ( https://youtu.be/0r3w61hfgia?t=17s ) they do n't even have the balls to say gypsy . 
  if you have high pregnancy rate for under 18 children , i 'd blame lack of sexual education , the only people that discussed protection were during religion class , where they 'd say `` the best contraceptive is abstinence '' , or `` you do n't need protection if you do n't have sex '' . 
  people can have sex 15 years , if they 're not thought about condoms or periods they 'll have children at a young age , so they need to get rid of them . 
  `` the best contraceptive is abstinence '' is what i hear from my religion class . 
  i did n't get sex ed . 
  at school . 
  sex ed . 
  is seen as taboo here and just last year did religion become optional , before you 'd have to say you 're not orthodox to take part of the class , but now you have to sign to say you take part . 
  so they should n't flee the country because they 're young ? 
  but are they fleeing a war-torn country ? 
  from what i get , for you `` brussels '' represents european bureaucracy ( even though it 's just the city of residence of multiple european institutions , some elected , some appointed )  no , orban is not part of brussels the council of europe is part of this european bureaucracy where heads of states agree on who should be the president of the coe and the commision . 
  the heads of states can also veto different laws . 
  there still are borders , the reason they could go through borders so easily might be because of the refugee wave or because they were eu citizens . 
  romania and france directly elect their president for example , i thought the representative in the council of europe appoint the commisioners . 
  putting ni in this precarious position :  it 's in the eu 's hands now . 
  this 'll be an issue that the eu and uk need to reach an agreement on . 
   mellenials were ripe and the deep state knew it . 
  this is the first time i actually saw someone say and it was n't satire . 
  good thing they 're not that popular , but the ideas are quite popular with those protesters and the religious . 
  nah , we should blame them norwegian gays trying to steal our romanian children .

   stop using buzzwords just for the sake of feeling good . 
  what buzzwords ? 
   person : `` would you attack insidific if he attacked you ? '', 
  but the thing is , there was no mention of an attack . 
  did someone say fleg ? 
  do you have a fleg ? 
  [ the_tower_of_babel_european_languages ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dixgt/the_tower_of_babel_european_languages/ ), 
  if you were in moscow it 'd be 1/4/17 . 
  would a spain controlled by the us still be the same spain ? 
  what about a russian romania or other eastern countries ? 
  german czech republic , french belgium etc. 
  we 're talking about spheres of influence dividing european countries . 
  was n't the referendum done after the occupation , with people running away from crimea and russian troops patrolling the streets ? 
  racism does n't excuse racism , we should n't generalise and stuff like that . 
  i also know of someone that has gone with some friends to bully a gypsy with legs in a cast by kicking his legs . 
  all because he rationalises his actions by saying `` he 's a gypsy , they 're scum '' . 
  kids segregating themselves to a radical ideology can be explained by the environment they grow up in , if they grow up feeling different , looked down upon or unwelcome they might harbour a hate for the society he grows up in and if they encounter something that feels like it validates them , like this terrorist organisation , they 'll willingly indoctrinate themselves . 
  blaming the failure of their integration on the culture of their parents that they 've probably never interacted with is a huge cop-out . 
  i looked at it from right to left and my first thoughts were `` those look like some manly men '' , i only noticed when i saw the stereotypically gay costume . 
  that 's the worst of it all . 
  we have shawarma , kebab , doner kebab , but no curry or rice unless you 're in the capital . 
  how did you know ? 
  / s it 's way too typical for these nationalists ( even if they call themselves social democrats ) . 
  should 've called us sons of dogs too . 
  more like the eu does n't enforce itself against the national governments that refuse our accession in schengen . 
  calling eu undemocratic , something about muslims entering their country through the eu , something about eastern european immigration , stuff like that . 
  white pride am i right , brother ? 
  our religious nut-jobs that want to make gay marriage constitutionally impossible ( based on religious belief ) said malaysia was a good example on how to treat gay people . 
  they also want to ban ? 
  the new beauty and the beast movie because gay propaganda . 
  it 's just a prank , bro . 
  must ` nt 'd 've, 
   if islam propaganda is ok , and a random mep saying women are weaker is not is there islam propaganda in the ep ? 
  look at me !, 
  i 've read 1984 and believe it reflects real life ! '', 
   also those countries had been independent a while before they joined . 
  why should that matter ? 
   but you must count the time for uk and scotland to be done with the process . 
  would it really take decades ? 
  even years ? 
   so it must be maintained by punishing anyone who dares leave . 
  ah yes , there it is again , even more #projectfear, 
   doing it again , what a mad man !, 
  wow . 
  from what i remember they are n't allowed to move them here . 
  also , the rocket defense system does n't have any nuclear capabilities , no matter how much russia says it does . 
   responding to a made-up quote no my man . 
  what is bannon doing in politics if `` he 's just trolling . 
  it 's just a prank , bro . 
  ca n't you take a joke ? '', 
  `` we need to grab chyna by the pussy ! '', 
   clearly not . 
  this sub has some pretty strict censorship policies . 
  people still have the chance to comment . 
  i do n't understand how censorship somehow makes you unable to comment . 
   letting the public have a chance to comment . 
  they were n't able to comment until then ? 
   modern turkey was less so . 
   compare it to a place like iraq today . 
  it seems to me we 're moving goalposts now . 
  how is it fair for some western companies to benefit from the east , but people in the east ca n't benefit from the west ? 
  spain said they 'd block them only if scotland left unilaterally . 
   well if you have n't been earmarking ~ 2 % of your total gdp towards the nato budget , you should n't get the protection of it . 
  there is n't and should n't be a condition for protection . 
  the 2 % is something we signed to achieve until 2024 and it was something like `` we should all reach at least 2 % '' . 
  i like how we 're right next to norway , switzerland and denmark , we only needed luxembourg to be in the mile-high club . 
  over-hype is a thing for many other subjects , like games and movies . 
  a good example is suicide squad .
