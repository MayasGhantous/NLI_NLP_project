  just go expecting it to be like any other european capital and get slightly surprised . 
  it is like a rubbish of cash . 
   it 's not a nazi salute , it 's just the roman salute `` ave caesar ! '' . 
   it 's not a nazi symbol , it 's a religious symbol that we decided to use even though we do n't follow the religion . 
  / s yes , it ends up being guilt by association because people might think you 're using the symbol for the wrong motive . 
  how is that an opinion ? 
   free movement was a massive mistake . 
  without free movement western companies can exploit the eastern population and move its products back west , the exploited would not be able to taste the fruits of its labour . 
  free movement is for the east what companies being able to buy local companies is for the west . 
   i wonder if your grandfather would agree more with the eastern europeans . 
  funny since he has romanian ethnicity . 
  children ca n't offer consent , two healthy adults can . 
  [ some people would applaud this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/5c7ll8/stay_classy_romania_homofobia_aplaudata_la/ ), 
  those countries , except for turkey , do n't threaten their neighbours ( with bombing ) at all , they do n't annex land and are n't actively in a dumb war with 2 of its neighbours . 
  genetics , a straight person is disgusted by having sex with a person of the same gender . 
  a gay person is disgusted by having sex with the opposite gender . 
  a bi-sexual person is n't bothered by it . 
  shocking ... 
  poland ! = france germany ! = france france ! = france anymore . 
  is n't that a term coined by [ aleksandr dugin ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin#formation_of_the_eurasia_movement ) i mean why would you be [ atlanticist ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wta5iocjrue/vumrrilqnhi/aaaaaaaaf-0/xiq6eaeyn5s/s1600/european-climate-zone-map.jpg ) when you are obviously continental !, 
  we should [ finlandize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) for russia right now . 
  he deletes his posts . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r31th/schulz_a_stronger_europe_means_a_stronger_germany/dd422w5/ ), 
  did n't trumpets say that 'd make war with russia , so that 's why they would n't vote for hillary . 
  `` you would n't want world war do you , vote trump ! '', 
   but the eu is n't a necissity , it 's not something that has to exist what is romania without the eu globally speaking ? 
  inside the eu romania is represented in this world stage instead of being pushed around by the us , russia or china . 
   why would countries fight nowadays when it 's easier to dominate through economic competition . 
  if a country had the possibility to dominate the local economy there 'd be sanctions put on their products or local products would be promoted . 
  because you will not be allowed in the competition and so it 'd be more profitable to take the country under your sphere of influence or take it by force, 
  you 'd have to create new human characters every time and you 'd also have to kill a human . 
  also , the `` reveal '' that the person the rabbit just killed is the same as him makes it symbolically stronger . 
  we could also talk about what it means that the rabbits are at war with other rabbits instead of a predator ( something that 'd justify self defence ) . 
  if you bring a horse it 's still a horse . 
  if a horse is born in the barn it is the barn 's horse . 
  wrong racists . 
  yes . 
   the reason for that is because the whole political spectrum in sweden is shifted a lot more to the left , than in most other countries . 
  that was literally his next sentence . 
  was there a reason for you to point out something redundant ? 
  how dare you call me a commie !, 
  but , we 'll be first 2nd . 
   anyways , how do colored americans feel about a white supremacist at the white house ? 
  some of them have started adopting their actions on `` innocent '' trump voters . 
  you 've those people that were pushing and beating a person because supposedly `` he voted trump ! '', 
  there 's also the instance where they 've tied up and tortured a supposed weaker teenager , but they were teens , did n't represent blm like trumpets would like to say and were probably looking for a reason to have fun . 
   the average gdp per capita in the commonwealth is $ 4,446 $ , half of romania 's . 
  that 's what happens when you compare to *** a freaking world power *** . 
   1941 and 1991 are the most important years in all of our timeline , even more so than ** 2041 ** . 
  will romania become superpower by then ? 
  that stereotype will continue to follow them , they ca n't run from it if it becomes a bad name , they should prove those stereotypes wrong . 
   just like japs is from japanese we should call them nihonjin . 
   and pakis is from pakistani . 
  we should call them qaum . 
   why would they be offended ... 
  if they were we 'd hear about it . 
   i do n't call germans b\u00f4che , i do n't call them former nazis . 
  i call them by the name they want to be referred as . 
  call them deutsch . 
   in romanian gypsy is transformed in a verb that means to bargain in a brutish manner , inelegant , to argue like gypsyes in front of the tent , means to argue a lot stereotypes . 
   the thing is psd has public support , not only did they win the elections but they won by a very large margin . 
  one thing we know for sure is they have the support of 18 % of the population , the rest did n't bother to vote . 
  but we do n't a left-wing/right-wing , the social-democrats wants to get rid of taxes and wants to help the rich corrupt , the national-liberals , well , they might be pro-business but i ca n't see anything . 
  we already have the whole north separated from the mainland , what would a small country mean ? 
  ( with how everyone 's `` ocd '' seems to manifest quite much ), 
   `` til eu member embassies can ~ ~ hold ~ ~ help other eu members citizens , if the country has no embassy ~ ~ on ~ ~ with the ** ir ** country . '', 
  better , 
  kinda hard for people to kill each other when they 're oppressed . 
  and danger does n't mean only the chance of getting murdered , but also other crimes , health ( i think that 's why fukushima is red ) and other things ( crimea is worse than both jamaica and cuba and not because of homicide rates ) . 
  we should n't focus on just the homicide rates , especially when the police cracks down on any dissent . 
  i 'm pretty sure not even borat knows where he lives . 
  what would happen if the uk wanted to deal with only the west ? 
  i mean , is there any actual trade uk would want from the east , from what i remember they do n't currently do any substantial trading . 
  this is turning into a competition , we should beat them at something , if they want to name a moon village after him then they should make it themselves . 
  a lot has changed in 2 years : /, 
  would n't that be hypocritical ? 
  kiwis , sheep shagging , basically wales . 
  the borders were not opened in the least . 
   one generation of sparse nutrition can not cause big physiological differences , if you look at the height of romanians that grew up during communism and the ones that grew after you can notice a huge difference . 
  starving your people definitely stunts your children 's growth . 
   `` voi ei '' does n't mean butter no , but rather oh no !, 
  we , romanians also have `` o vai '' . 
   interesting that this `` us or them '' talk usually seems to come from the west , but not from russia homosexuality is western propaganda . 
  nato has expanded on russia 's border , etc. 
  [ i love all that tentacle inside romania . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_royal_family ) *** dig deeper senpai !, 
   you really want to mimic germany !? 
  please yes !, 
  it must be extremely practical surviving getting nuked back . 
   anti eu parties more like anti-refugee crisis parties . 
  the only reason they gained popularity is by saying it 's the eu 's fault for not dealing with the crisis ( even though they literally ca n't ) . 
   i ca n't help but feel romania 's growth would be inevitable anyway if different pillars / benefits of the eu were implemented slowly over time until her economy was close up with the west . 
  then add free movement do n't you think that would make romanians feel like they 're being used by the rich western companies ? 
  we already have some communist nostalgists that complain the autochthonous industry was destroyed by the west . 
  i would n't want euro-skeptics in the east that would turn to putin and even more corruption . 
  if you keep any benefits you 'd still get people angry : the rich , the poor etc. 
  i guess if you let all the benefits in at the same time you get western people angry until the eastern economy catches up . 
  if you keep freedom of movement you 'd get eastern people angry until they reach that goal ( we already feel like second grade eu citizens because of our schengen accession , where the goal is wait until every country lets us in since we 've already done the other goals ) .
