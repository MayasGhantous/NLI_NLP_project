  that might be only an estonian thing . 
  ** how dare you !, 
  do n't you have any respect of god ? 
   the movement is very much one-way from eastern europe and sadly laid the foundations for a uk exit . 
  and the ability of companies to buy local industries is something that western europe greatly benefits from . 
   the eastern economies should have had more time to develop before lumping them in the east-west difference would probably be bigger , since the east would n't have the quick progress they currently have and the west would become even richer faster . 
  ( and let 's not talk about the benefits eastern eu gets from managing to join )  think about it - for all the eastern europeans who move to the west , who really decides to move to the east ? 
  companies that come for cheap labour and buy local industries . 
  the reason the freedom of movement is important is so people in eastern europe can benefit too from the western industries . 
  hopefully with a 6 % gdp increase we can reach a smaller discrepancy . 
   while we do n't know if the beggars here are gypsies or not , we are pretty sure they are romanians i thought it 'd be the opposite actually , based on skin colour and unless you 've got their papers you should n't be able to tell if they 're romanian or another nationality . 
  there are a lot more non-romanian roma than romanian roma so you ca n't say they 're most probably romanian . 
  1 ) people should tell that you 're not native roma because you would n't be able to speak the language , but then you might get racists think you 're speakin roma so maybe you should say you 're a tourist from india , then you 'll feel a lot of hospitality especially in the countryside . 
  we enjoy having tourists . 
  also , at least here you should n't get too many stares because we 're used to the brown skin . 
  2 ) cities most definitely thanks to the young , but on the countryside should be harder, 
  or the people in power could be * legally * paid off by big pharma and such ( corruption is basically legal ) so they can continue making immense profits . 
   if anything 's prevented war , it 's nato greece and turkey both might have gone to war while in nato over cyprus , they were stopped because of outside pressure . 
  the reason the eu was created was so france and germany would n't want to attack each other by having such integrated trade agreements . 
  yes, 
  [ we 'll be having a cultural exchange on 12th of january . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5movyj/announcement_upcoming_amas_and_cultural_exchanges/ ) i 've missed any announcements from this sub so i think the mods are either trying to be coy about it or i just missed it . 
  that and an opportunity to give back to israel . 
   you can do what you like and move to a full federation immediately . 
  ok , then stop vetoing the eu army . 
   * if britain wants to keep a and z , it can negotiate with the eu for them as standalones once it is no longer an eu member . 
  i would like to add that getting benefit a from the eu means you need to accept the b and c . the uk ca n't access the free market or free movement of capital without the free movement of people , so they 'd basically become like norway or switzerland . 
  although the uk can still have * some * agreements with a few countries , although nothing that includes the eu . 
  more like you refuse to get this over with faster . 
  if you want you can take as long as you want . 
  [ here 's what turkey needs to join the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) and [ here are some statements including juncker 's and schulz ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#official_points_of_view ), 
  free trade agreements, 
   almost all of them accept that it works very well in switzerland . 
  did n't they corner themselves to a eu `` guillotine '' clause where they 'd lose their trade agreements with the eu because they 'd restrict eu immigration ? 
   hungary : catholic gypsies haha , eat it hungary !, 
   romania : orthodox latins finally !, 
  it 's the same x to point out hypocrisy . 
  no , [ `` heaving '' ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/heave ) , they 're trying really hard . 
   in fact romania has the lowest eu funds absorbtion meaning we are too ifiotic to even spend the eu money which has tobe returned . 
  [ we were given 19.000.000.000 and we used 9.500.000.000 in 2015 so 49 % ] ( http://insideurope.eu/taxonomy/term/174 ) there 's still 5 more years until 2020 , we 're halfway there . 
   death of population population 's `` death '' should n't be a huge problem , after the period of the `` no abortions allowed '' law the population will die until a natural level . 
  a bigger problem is the pensions and the strain that the pensioners will make on the young people 's lives , but still no collapse . 
  so after the population growth stabilises everything will be alright . 
  and she got a lot of flak for it , so i do n't think it 's a smart choice to antagonise herself even more . 
  if she does something it 'd better be with a lot of european backing . 
  her situation is a `` damned if you do , damned if you do n't '' scenario , people want her to take leadership , but that 'd mean ignoring people and other countries , others want germany to stop having so much influence in europe ( or `` fourth reich '' how they like to call it ) and you do n't want to legitimise the europhobes . 
  the romanian ip got banned because of `` spam '', 
  chisinau worse than in the epicentre lul, 
  cute how we 're getting a tag just for us after how often we appear on this subreddit . 
  hopefully this does n't end up like that one time with 4chan , but let 's be serious they 're nationalists what 'd we expect . 
  do n't bring incest into my fan-fiction !, 
  it 's so odd the change of ownership in crimea while in school . 
  the muslims there are the majority , not the minority reread my comment lebanon is one of the countries that does better than the muslim nations . 
  the christians play a significant role in their poilitics . 
  their president is christian . 
  they 're 40 % of their population , so yes , the bigger the minority the better the nation 's tolerance . 
  another example is hungarians in romania vs the roma . 
  ( perception-wise ), 
  minorities are more aggressive the smaller and pushed away they are . 
  it was after the last attack . 
  we 're talking about europe after all . 
  is n't there an anarchist utopia somewhere in denmark ? 
  oh yeah , [ a copenhagen neighborhood called christiania with 800 people in it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freetown_christiania ), 
   maybe its an answer for somebody `` i hope my neighbour 's goat dies '', 
  why not ? 
  shhh, 
  hmm , i wonder who 'd buy [ a dacia instead of a renault ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia#acquisition_by_renault ), 
   read it on reddit your friends must really like the joke . 
  you can add romania too . 
  oh shit , i thought we were supposed to keep going straight , we might 've reached india if we continued . 
  do n't you worry , i 've already laid claims on moldova , bulgaria , morocco and algeria !, 
  http://i.imgur.com/gembbyg.jpg the new roman empire will be formed !, 
  yep , what is the difference between them ? 
  everyone could 've passed the strait of gibraltar without noticing it . 
  dacia is former romania so it * obviously * needs to be romanian . 
   car map ( most sold make ) : http://i.imgur.com/kktmjec.png extremadura and canary * islands rightful romanian clay . 
  ( * this romanian legionary got lost travelling the seas ), 
  ` ey there, 
   46 % of percentages stated online are fabricated . 
  +  the other 78 % may also be cherry picked . 
  it seems some might even be impossible, 
  nah , the people creating them were doing it with reluctance , hoping it never gets used . 
   we have to use our passports every time that 's because you 're not in schengen , romanians , bulgarians , croatians and other non-schengen countries do the same . 
  how many times did may take part in eu leaders ' meetings ? 
  she looks like a shy transfer student . 
  if it were we 'd introspect more . 
  stop talking to mirrors . 
   world class at , it 's, 
   the vore each mep has do n't google that ( creepy getting eaten fetish ), 
  it wo n't be a lie until the uk stops pushing for it . 
  also , boris has been pushing for it before brexit and now he 's at it again . 
  if they did end up having an accident , i do n't think it would change anything if they had both their hands on the wheel . 
  cnn is faker than infowars ?!, 
  alex jones ?!, 
  the person that argues about aliens , reptiles and illuminati ?!, 
  are you an idiot ? 
  both , it 's called reaction , you do n't need the stick for quick reactions . 
   `` at risk gay men '' is an euphemism for promiscuous gay men is hiv only a gay problem ? 
  do straight people not get and spread hiv ?
