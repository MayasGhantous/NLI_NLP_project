  after bringing up that meme statistic i guess no . 
  he is polish , he uses the flair for shock value . 
  i thought the result would be us and eu as equal partners in nato instead of being dragged around . 
  historically speaking they kind of were . 
  *** the silence is deafening ***, 
  you ca n't keep being on the fence forever , either pick a side or * die * . 
  and therefore very gorgeous . 
  nationalistic for their respective in-group . 
  okamura considers himself czech , which people find ironic since he would need people to be accepting of foreigners , something that nationalists stereotypically are n't seen being . 
  or some ultra libertarian ideology . 
   no borders for trade or people this is something liberals and capitalists would love . 
   culture does n't matter this could be seen as a parallel to extreme atheism and liberalism . 
  there still is some falafel , baklava and other sweets , but i would n't mind some more recipes . 
   communist  people are merely economic units kek, 
  we should retake antioch and jerusalem ( aka push further ) . 
  japan is pretty nationalistic to this day . 
  something something boogeyman . 
  there are elections . 
  he wo n't be here forever . 
  do you know anything about belgium ? 
  of course it 's multicultural . 
  france germany uk the netherlands belgium and northern italy were way richer for centuries . 
  it mostly depended on `` empire '' . 
  i sometimes feel time is a flat circle ... 
  this is the second time i 've seen this posted here . 
  here we go : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/362p04/the_relief_map_of_europe_created_by_anton_balazh/?ref=search_posts, 
  / u/dassinjoe is right . 
   fucking brexiter , i hope your economy crashes . 
  is anti-circlejerk circlejerk . 
  no / s, 
  who cares , i 'm being mean . 
  the same could be said for / u/lebron181, 
  1882 the uk passed an act . 
  1971 in switzerland , i would n't call portugal or switzerland `` backasswater '' countries . 
   bosnia lmao, 
  okay erdogan ... 
  the cvm is n't really that bad . 
  it just monitors . 
  it is n't that intrusive to the individual . 
   you can disagree with the outcome , and what the people want , but to say it 's undemocratic because the result was n't to your liking is ludicrous . 
  you 're seeing brexit where there 's no mentions of it . 
  did someone really downvote you because you did n't get their racist insinuation ? 
  what is india for 1000 . 
  presents and capitalism , mostly . 
  this medley contains a lot of other famous pieces . 
  it follows this [ pentatonix song . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/3mteslpxcpo ), 
  nobody disagreed with you , my dude . 
  stop having your panties in a twist . 
  greece was an exclave before the 2007 expansion . 
  but would n't the inhabitants have a name that follows their country ? 
  like russian , mongolian , korean ( as korea ' ending sounds like - ia ) and other - ia countries . 
  but i guess you could follow the german-germany ( since in old english it was - ye ) instead of hungarian-hungary . 
  denying facts is different than asking for information . 
  hence the genocide *** denial *** . 
  god damn it eu why wo n't you , for no reason , reprimand the largest contributor for not listening to one of their non-binding referendums . 
  1 ) they can , they ca n't join nato . 
  2 ) ukraine is n't entering the eu . 
  more like romanian or austrian since france and england are n't called francia and englia in english . 
  that 's pretty offensive since you 're making it seem like you view the country as just a border zone instead of a country in its own right . 
  no , i just had a problem with you using only the rich upper class as an example of european culture . 
  i believe that the era shown is way too romanticised . 
  of course european culture is based on the rich , posh europeans , but we should n't forget there also was the culture of the poor and sick , sometimes living right next to the rich ( like in our capital ) . 
  what our society and culture is right now is the best it has ever been in history . 
  we in romania call them cehia ( czechia with a soft ch ) . 
  also , chechnya is cecenia ( like czeczenia ), 
  and that did n't seem to stop him ... 
  that moment when our resident troll gets serious . 
  i was shocked . 
  hence the `` wow '' . 
  wow . 
  china would probably want a diverse source of meat . 
  also austria with holzindustrie schweighofer and [ ikea and harvard . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfbxrvqzq40 ), 
  some countries do n't have the capability to grow high numbers of produce ( china needs a lot of meat ) . 
  they might be focusing on something else because their environment is more prolific for that business . 
  fuck her , my dude , [ she deserves it . 
  ] ( https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-sees-measles-outbreak-due-anti-vaccination-campaign/ ), 
  we 've recently had a small outbreak on our western side ( probably caused by poverty or olivia steer with her pseudo-science ) one in italy and another one somewhere else . 
  i believe the intense red of 15-30 can be easily distinguished . 
  the biggest problem i had at the beginning was with 2-5 and 5-15 but once i 've seen estonia and latvia , it was easy . 
  the 5-15 looks meat-red , the 15-30 looks blood-red . 
  it 's pretty noticeable . 
  look at germany and france . 
   lmg light machine gun, 
   want them dead that 's pretty exaggerated , they do n't recognise their genocide as a genocide and they have a situation in nagorno-karabakh which was caused by movements during the soviet union . 
  angela merkel , by your rules of the democratic process , is n't elected , the same as with your prime ministers . 
  the merchant of death is because he invented something that would kill people , he did n't want to help in killing people . 
  get rid of all ministers , even prime ministers , in all `` democratic '' countries seems to be the solution to your problem . 
  it 's not their fault when people choose to use their technology for bad . 
  the same with internet that 's being used to recruit terrorists and other minors bad things . 
  he invented dynamite , he did n't do anything wrong . 
  i had a feeling he was `` just a concerned citizen '' . 
  i know , hilarious right ? 
  how can he be so stupid ? 
  i 'm pretty sure he is n't jewish , he is just polish using israel 's flag for shock value . 
  thanks lord . 
  of course , i was mocking the alt-right for their utopian view of japan trying to reason their racism . 
  i 'm fully aware of a lot of japan 's problems . 
  is n't that illegal since wwi ?
