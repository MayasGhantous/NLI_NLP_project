  probably italian, 
  but muh dacic intergalactic empire . 
  it shoots with teeth-shaped bullets, 
  it 's called summer, 
  seems like romania annexed hungary , sorry, 
  also the start of one of the biggests genocides in history, 
  check his flair . 
  why would they ? 
  polish spam is real . 
  oh my god this bullshit again , we pay billions for highways and they never finish them , you ca n't improve the standard of living if you steal all the money , do n't blame nato , blame our politicians . 
  ming : excluse me ? 
  destroyed them all . 
  damn ukrainians stealing polish jerbs, 
  til us is an empire, 
   soviets installed a puppet government , they tortured and murdered any former insurgents they could find over the next 10-15 years . 
  soviet union in a nutshell . 
   but that they 'll be able to take warsaw before russians come . 
  but , why ? 
  the soviets were still coming and forcing them to become their puppets , did they belive that poland would become an independent democratic country ? 
  the battle was costly for germans , 200.000 seems a fair numbers for the nazi leaders , they knew the risks from the death of heydrich but counted on soviet support which never arrived . 
  but even if they were helped their fate would be the same , the soviets would kill them all like the rest of the elites in other countries , i guess they let the germans do the work for them , they were the same people who invaded poland in 1939, 
  trusting russians is not a good ideea and in my opinion in that year all the revolts in eastern europe were useless . 
  why is the polish uprising a tragic event . 
   did he pick his pocket ?!, 
  xd you forgot mentioning that all romanians are gypsies . 
  these are used mostly by sheperds but [ these ] ( http://www.striblea.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iliescu-caciula.jpg ) are more common to normal people , older mostly , they are smaller and look like a fez , some people call it fes or c\u0103ciul\u0103 . 
  the point of this is ? 
   taxies , castings ... i see you 're a man of culture as well, 
  make 1939 happen again .

   and the reason why they are wondering how their memes and lies fail to effect european politics . 
  blaming a country for the actions of trump supporters . 
  you mean american elections system ? 
  maybe it was a kaiserreich joke . 
  saw this several times this year ffs . 
  they will leave the country anyway . 
  spain can not into eastern europe . 
  do n't repeat yourself . 
  as i said , terrain and fortifications kinda does that and even with the course of the war was n't changed, 
  yeah , terrain and fortifications kinda does that . 
  wittmann was a true hero , he and his tanks against the british . 
  the finns were heroes , fought against the huge su and inflicted huge casualties against them , terrain and weather helped them too, 
   you suggested , that poland was not present in ww1 at all , not involved with 0 history there . 
  which is denying history . 
  just because at the beginning of that war , there was no poland on map , does not mean , that there was no polish soldiers , military , etc. 
  i 'm talking about poland as an indepedent country not about some polish rebels do n't twist my words lol . 
   your jokes do not sound like jokes btw . 
  here is the joke i was talking about  yeah , in a minute you will say , lenin gave it for free . 
  indirect yes  you ca n't have a bad military history if you did n't had a military history . 
  [ context ] ( your jokes do not sound like jokes btw . ), 
   if the red revolution was stopped   when ? 
  how ? 
  i do n't care about alternative history , besides it has nothing to polish military history . 
  read the the whole comment please . 
   edit : [ `` 1-month resistance '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_contribution_to_world_war_ii ) yeah , the allies would lose without polish help , thank you poland , they fought to become soviet puppets . 
   poland was not really interested in the main event , they had to support triple entente for some time , in order to reclaim independence . 
  you may want to read about j. pilsudski and his activity during wwi and after wwi . 
  this activity allowed to reclaim the country and independence . 
  not sitting in the basement , waiting for this to end . 
  maybe you want to also read about rydz-\u015amig\u0142y or haller in that time . 
  whatever . 
   oh , so it is a joke now ? 
  the first comment you replied was a joke but i see you do n't understand it so is ok .  you are denying history here dude . 
  you are not accurate at any means . 
  yes i am , are you saying that poland existed as a country and not as a region during ww1 ? 
   poland was not really interested in the main event because it did n't existed oh my god . 
   they had to support triple entente for some time , in order to reclaim independence . 
  you may want to read about j. pilsudski and his activity during wwi and after wwi . 
  if the entente won the war in the starting setup russia woud n't give poland indepence  this activity allowed to reclaim the country and independence . 
  nah , that was lenin throwing russia \u00eento civil war that gave poland chance to become independent . 
   just dont deny the history please and youre golden . 
  saying that poland did n't existed during ww1 ia denying ? 
  but hey , you forgot about the partition of polish-lithuanian union that had nothing to do with military , was n't that denying too ? 
   who was the leader of poland during the ww1 , which side did poland take , who lead the army . 
    [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_poland_during_world_war_i )  [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_army_ ( poland ) from your link while ** poland did not exist as an independent state ** during world war i , ** its geographical position between the fighting powers meant that much fighting and terrific human and material losses occurred on the polish lands *** between 1914 and 1918 . 
   `` a total of 2 million polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers , 450,000 died and close to one million were wounded . '', 
  yeah , is not like the war was mostly fought in polish provincies with polish soldiers in all countries depending in region the blue army was formed because of the red revolution and us help . 
  if the red revolution was stopped and the russians were on the winning side then the polish independence would be just a dream . 
   dude , what argument , i gave you some examples , and your reply was like poland was gone for a century . 
  yes , but not because of military , because of politics . 
  in think you forgot to read the deluge i mentioned but that does n't help your ignorant argument , that was military .
