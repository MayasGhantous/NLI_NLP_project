  \u00cen 1990 an adviser of the pm asked the minister of defense for 20kg of trotyl to blow the protesters . 
  1940 worst year of my life . 
  my city after rains http://www.click.ro/sites/default/files/styles/articol/public/medias/2017/07/04/9-act-foto-1-7col-16cm.jpg?itok=jxxsdyn4, 
  six mineriads hapepned in total , the last one was in 1999 launched by the miners leader miron cozma because he was convicted for 1991 mineriads , he was later pardoned by the president iliescu but he revoked his pardon they mostly raised hell in the capital , thrasing everything in their way , beating up or even killing protesters , storming press offices and opposition buildings . 
  one of the miners declaration after they stormed pnt party :  we found drugs , firearms and munitions , `` an automatic typewriter '' , and fake currency, 
  not because we are poor of course . 
  pasta and pizza does n't have meat in it ? 
  coca fields in albania ? 
  the cocaine comes mostly from south america . 
  what ? 
  does albania have coca or poppy fields ? 
  nice to hear it . 
  yeah i know but did n't they closed it after those cops were shot ? 
  was n't it raided and closed by police the last time ? 
  did n't hate uk , untill now . 
  no problem bulgaria , no immigrants will stay in our countries anyway, 
  no , no , no , he was already pm of romania and this year the salvation party replaced him with [ this ] ( http://cdn1.tion.ro/2016/07/feature41.jpg ) that was replaced with [ this ] ( https://static2.playtech.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mihai-tudose-psd-prim-ministru-1-436x575.jpg ), 
  til i 'm a religious man , probably going to visit greece . 
   btw , are you ? 
  yeah , wan na see my red flag ? 
  or he just use soros for propaganda just like in romania , people protest against legalization of theft ? 
  soros paid them , sport fans wreak havoc at the peaceful protests ? 
  soros started a coup . 
  he is 86 years old and he keep fighting, 
   you tell me . 
  spam  do you have problem with freedom of speech ? 
  what , i 'm a nazi now ? 
  i do n't allow freedom of speech because i consider these things annoying ? 
   and ? 
  my thought exactly , what would happen if we start posting birthdays of every state that existed in europe ? 
  \\  plc is kill \\  no, 
  looks very comfortable, 
  seems like eu4 campaign hit real life, 
  romania be like : `` help '', 
  surprise motherfucker, 
  they do n't need those countries for cocaine smuggling when they have spain and italy ports like tauro port in calabria that is controlled by them, 
  i believe that is because those are doing only petty crimes and the italians are there only to launder the money they make in italy from open drug markets , waste management etc and they are harder to catch . 
  i 'm a vampire i will drink your blood, 
  in romania things like this are more common than shops , some of them were closed because of ties with camorra . 
  2017 shot in the head http://observator.tv/social/detalii-socante-crima-viilor-209348.html, 
  we have that to http://www.bistrita24.ro/foto/view/1200x1200/trio-aurolac.jpg, 
  there are rumors he even did a whole marijuana, 
   it 's about his skills and qualifications and intelligence that 's what i 'm afraid of, 
  memes on him, 
  that 's one of his good pictures , they could 've used [ this ] ( https://playtech.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mihai-tudose-psd-prim-ministru-1-436x575.jpg ) one , pretty sure his face was the reason op posted this anyway , we are fucked , there is theory that the majority leader send this proposal so that the president would 100 % reject him and the next proposal would be bad but better than the first proposal this is probably one of our worst pm . 
  we will make our own schengen area , with croatia and bulgaria, 
  something , something gibraltar, 
  remind me when they legalise the recreational one, 
   what i mean is that there is nobody even talking about impeaching the president [ now the president can trigger new elections or dragnea will impeach the president to prevent him from triggering the new elections . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6il0xo/romanian_government_impeached_by_his_own_party/dj72avb/_= ) we are n't talking about iohannis impeachment here ? 
  i never said a referendum will be held , i just said how that works and how popular is iohannis, 
  go read the constitution `` fake news '' man , if the president is impeached/suspended a referendum must be held, 
  i just explained him that situation , did n't say is possible, 
  very popular , a referendum will be held and probably will be rejected but that 's not the point , while this is happening he will be temporarly revoked and an interim will take his place , that interim can name a pm favorable to the party that revoked the president . 
   i have n't seen much about him in the news he had a meeting with trump a while ago , with merkel some days ago and he will meet with macron soon, 
  yes, 
  he would lose popular vote but he would still control the parliament untill new elections, 
  yes please, 
  he already lost popular support , if iohannis trigger elections dragnea will lose so the best solution is to impeach the president , do you think peoples will vote again for dragnea after he kicked out ponta from psd ? 
  we need elections, 
  temperature posts everywhere, 
  who is this belarus guy ? 
  hmm , i should fill that white with yellow, 
  [ here ] ( http://static4.libertatea.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sarmale-cu-carne-de-pui-620x465.jpg ) take a sarma, 
  relevant flair . 
  i like compot, 
  because the government renounced degree 13 which would make psd leader a `` honest '' man, 
  is the same as the old cabinet , the only difference is the number , working only in pictures , the pm is now in timisoara literally crying for support . 
  we are fucked , the political crisis may prolong to months or even elections, 
  germanfrankreich, 
  he was convicted for election fraud . 
   is this real ? 
  yes , the entire cabinet resigned except the pm who did n't want to resign and the coalition party that put him there will remove him next week . 
  this is a paradox . 
  at least building is faster than the romanian highways though . 
  romania ne like : '' hold my \u021buic\u0103 '', 
  the president probably will cancel those meetings , the country have a pm with no ministers and he will be kicked out by the majority in parliament so the president must propose a new pm we are fucked . 
  meeh, 
  but what about daea ? 
  pope, 
  those faces in third picture ,, 
  i like the old man happiness yeeeeeeee, 
  best romanian food ever, 
  who would win ? 
  a swedish guard or this little piece of lego ? 
  if you look at poland in the second photo you will see polish-lithuania commonwhealth, 
  damn czechs , stealing our coastline - hungarian nationalist, 
  lol , i thought it was real . 
  i will check it out thanks, 
   kickass still lives at https://katcr.co/ . 
  i know but it sucks , it 's just a shadow of what it used to be . 
  thanks , i will try it . 
  it work nice even if it is down sometimes , i started using it again after kickass was closed . 
  i need some pasta recipes except carbonara , tomato and bolognese , something similar \u00een simplicty would be nice . 
  what about the deluge, 
   also , north korea copied your arc de triomphe . 
  [ it looks nice though ] ( http://bucuresti.tourneo.ro/wp-content/gallery/arcul-de-triumf-artistic/arc-de-triumf-artistic.jpg ), 
  meanwhile romania . 
  dutch navy trolling uk before trolling existed, 
  the citadel is the front door , behinde the closed doors we will use the money to buy watermelons edit : of course soros is involved .
