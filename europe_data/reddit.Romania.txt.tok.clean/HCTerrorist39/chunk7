  2 fiddy and half a schmeckles, 
  i give you 3 smiggles . 
  how much ? 
  bravo ukraine . 
  nice flag finland, 
  no poster with trump kissing putin ? 
  in rate this 8/10, 
  yeah , he hit those innocent muslims , they were retriving the knifes they dropped in those british people, 
  yeah , i mean uk helped nk a lot with those money , nk really need those nuclear bombs . 
   mate . 
  undercover british detected . 
  money bro , always money . 
  man i never understood those things , here most of the food starts with an mc mcapplepie , mcchicken ( mcpuisor lel ) , mcnuggets etc. 
  and give millions of gbp to north korea . 
  i like him , his spirit is awesome , he was there , getting people in that bakery and giving brooms , sticks and paddles to people to defend themself . 
  `` go get that big paddle and some strong sticks , i bashed that terrorist head so hard '' i like how he shout : `` fuck you '' at the terrorists and then someone tell him to stop filming and go and he is : `` yes yes '' here is his video if anyone is interesed . 
  ohh i ca n't post fb videos . 
  is not flame , is a historical discussion , the europeans did n't the saw the ottomans as a real threat untill was too late , the romanians had some strong leadership but they were in most of the times betrayed or lost because of bad luck , i think the romanians were n't united in spirit until 19th century when the nationalist waves appeared in europe . 
   the only one i know of is micraes wars against the ottomans , which he ultimately lost but got a good peace treaty , while being our allies . 
  never heard that name . 
   vlad came to corvinus because wallachians deserted to his muslim brother radu , should n't have impaled everyone . 
  he came at mathias with his army asking for help against the ottomans and what he received ? 
  a big fuck you  hungary was n't occupied because of that , the only reason you know about vlad was because of his needless cruelty , not as a military leader . 
  vlad led one successful small campaign and a night raid against the ottomans , that was it . 
  is kinda a hard to fight an army of 100.000 with 20.000 even with the help from your ally that never arrived :|, 
  what did i said that you considered otherwise ? 
   that happened many times in history , you fight , you are defeted , you lose territories . 
  from my point of view it is , why i would n't want transylvania to be a part of romania ? 
   the wallachians accepted the ottoman rule without fight , hence why they accepted suzerainty . 
  that 's why the ottomans invaded wallachia so many times and failed a lot ? 
   the 14th and 15th history of hungary is just a long struggle against the ottomans that we have ultimately lost . 
  let 's remember how mathias corvin betrayed his fellow christian ally vlad tepes who was fighting the ottoman empire and imprisoned him , bad luck for hungary that they were occupied later . 
  not all of it because the rest was occupied by austria and they occupied it to for more than 100 years and some decades after they got occupied again . 
  the wallachians fought a lot of wars against the ottomans and helped other christian countries while hungary ... 
  so was hungary . 
  that happened many times in history , you fight , you are defeted , you lose territories . 
  no problem , they will take it while taking slovakia . 
  probably , he took their baker jerb, 
  ** sharping the knife **, 
   tu mi-ai dat downvote ma ? 
  of course is an insult to eat that pizza without ketchup . 
  tl : dr what the usr ever done for us ? 
  i mean , you want them to do with 8 % ? 
  he wants to keep the party together . 
  when they started the construction ? 
  ok then , put in on my mamaliga . 
  r/italy is kill, 
  trump joke went too far . 
  til penny is german and here in romania their diversity is low to . 
  i like kaufland and lidl for their diversity , i see a lot unknown products there that are great . 
  yeah , popescu is common and ion is used more common ionescu . 
  in romanians it means priest . 
  is popa a common name wtf ?

  hmm , what about the president stealing 1 billion of euro and then pardon himself ? 
  why i did n't become a president ? 
  it was used by the last president and in his time that ashtray would be replaced by whisky glasses . 
  [ here is a picture of him and juncker ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/1/1687/16286538/1/basescu.jpg?width=605 ) whisky kiss . 
  see the quote,

  thanks for the trigger . 
  r/austria be careful . 
  romania can into hungary, 
  this is a nice roma song https://youtu.be/durf0kkk4e8, 
  that 's why i was surprised , in the last incident in usa when erdogan bodyguards beated those protesters they blamed usa for aggresion and demanded excuses and now he is the opposite . 
  our army budget is 2 % of gdp , we invest but i 'm not sure how relevant those investments would be . 
  his name is klau ** s ** iohanni ** s ** do you still belive in coincidences ? 
  wake up good people, 
  hmm , i forgot about erdogan , did n't saw a single picture of him , he seems kind a quiet . 
   that muslim headgear who is she ? 
  isis claimed the toaster attack , 2 bread slices were burned to death . 
  this is such a stupid idea, 
  yes we can , there are berlin walls that are still standing . 
  str\u00e2nge that isis claimed the attack . 
   romanians do n't steal [ heh ] ( https://static2.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/even+if+he+was+serious+so+was+it+pretty+funny+_cca05407e204c6a68ce63137fb21d4e1.gif ), 
  i like that turkey do n't give a fuck about diplomacy , instead to hide that event they instead blame us . 
  they should learn from romania , ally with germans then switch side when war goes to shit . 
  i have no words for this . 
  i like pula , is a nice city, 
  that 's a tremendous plan , time to make constantinopole christian again . 
  last time that was tried hungary got occupied . 
  plot twist , we sack berlin . 
   i have n't been in romania in years , but i remember violent clashes , with more security personnel than participants . 
  there were cops ar both marches . 
  someone who understands good food . 
  [ that is n't even my final form ] ( https://homemadewithmess.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/pasta-011.jpg ), 
  i do n't know if i can live without potatoes , i rar them in all ways possible . 
  yeah , i like italian food like pasta with ketchup or pizza with ananas . 
  gib back dracula flair,
