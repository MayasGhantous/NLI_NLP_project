stop calling it fucking `` racist '' . 
  its not racist to say `` put all muslims in jail '' . 
  if i say `` all americans are prudes '' thats not racist , its xenophobic . 
  it would be racist if i would have said `` all blacks are drug dealers . '', 
  muslims are not a separate race . 
  they can be white , black , yellow , pink , whatever . 
  being a muslim is a cultural decision , its not a race . 
  yeah , but 1gb is so 2014 . 
  by 2020 people will think of it like we think of 100mb now . 
  if they keep this up , i 'll need to put my raid array into another raid array just to be able to download ( legally , of course ) movies . 
  lets hope 4k becomes a standard fast , or else all this speed wo n't mean anything . 
  it 's already faster to download an entire season of your favorite tv show than it is to find and select the one episode you were missing . 
  well , tbh , its a known fact that a lot of people in romania are `` employed '' without the proper papers so the employee wo n't pay any taxes . 
  so in reality , i think that number is way lower . 
  not second to last ? 
  romania stronk !, 
  its funny , any time i see any graphs on / r/europe , i dont even care about the first countries . 
  its norway/sweden/finland anyway . 
  i just look at the end to see the two of us . 
  as a romanian , is nice to know that we 're not second to last as usual ( hi bulgaria :p ), 
  news flash !, 
  bulgaria uses the russian diversion in ukraine to move in the former yugoslavia . 
  this was the master plan all along . 
  but they are good guys , so they just move there , dont annex it . 
  the serbs are not pissed off , they just move a bit north in hungary . 
  also , borders dont really touch eachother , that 's just so 2014 . 
  what do you mean ? 
  in romanian , about 25 % of the vocabulary has slavic roots . 
  i ca n't speak for bulgaria , but i 'm betting even more . 
  for example , a lot of rivers , mountains , hills or forests in romania have slavic names . 
  well , tbh , we kinda are . 
  same genetic mix ( romans , thracians and ~ ~ slaves ~ ~ slavs ) mostly, 
  romania stronk !, 
  only basescu would say that he has a contingency plan if russia attacks ... 
  wow , that is a huge convoy . 
  ty for the link !, 
  video does n't work ( in romania ) . 
  any mirrors ? 
  romania : very stringent , you would need to go through a lot of tests for hunting weapons : - you need to be subscribed to a hunting club or a registered weapons collector . 
  - medical ( neurologic , blood work , psychiatric , eye tests ) - go through a 6-30 days wait time after you pay the taxes for the permit - once you get the permit , you need to buy the gun fast or that permit will expire . 
  - you then have 10 days to go to your local police precinct and register the weapon - it is illegal to own more than 100 bullets at one time . 
  you can buy 100 , shoot them , buy another 100 . 
  ** edit : ** by hunting weapons , i mean only hunting rifles . 
  and you are not allowed to own more than 2 of the same caliber . 
  obviously , no auto or semi-auto weapons are allowed , at all . 
  for regular weapons : - all of the above ( except the hunting/collector 's membership club ) but you have to be either a policeman , magistrate , dignitary or in military . 
  otherwise you ca n't get one . 
  it 's both . 
  whoever thinks its only one or the other , is a plain idiot . 
  # 1 we have presidential elections coming up in a few months . 
  the current president , basescu , had his brother acquitted even if there were recordings of the said brother getting bribes from known criminals to influence the president . 
  thus , basescu had to create a diversion and try to get rid of the media trust that 's 100 % against him . 
  everyone knows that once basescu 's mandate will be over , he will go to jail for all the shit he 's done - corruption mostly . 
  # 2 now , on the other hand the owner of the intact media trust is no saint either . 
  none of the romanian multi-milionares are self made ( think bill gates , mark mark zuckerberg , etc ) . 
  they all did bad shit at one point in their life and profited from that . 
  be it selling the fleet ( our current president ) , buying land from the state and selling it back to the state at over 1000 % markup , or `` managed '' different contracts - we have one of the most expensive freeways in the world . 
  no , its not because its made of gold . 
  its because of corruption . 
  as a word of advice for non-romanian folks , anytime you read about romania 's politics , always assume that what you 've just read is half wrong . 
  we have different parties , but they dont matter since people keep moving from one party to the other based on where they have the opportunity of stealing the most money . 
  imagine the same guy moving from liberals to conservatives to liberals again . 
  this is a common thing here . 
  or today saying that `` x '' is an idiot and we should all hate him and tomorrow forming an alliance with `` x '' because . . money . 
  bucharest , romania : public transport is really cheap , a 30 day pass for all buses , trams and trolleys costs as much as 8 liters of gas . 
  the conditions are decent , most of the machines are quite new . 
  do n't expect superb comfort but they will get you to where you need to go and you wo n't feel repulsed by them . 
  i 'm 29 , never got a car because i dont need it . 
  my gf has one so when we need to go outside of the city or when we need to carry stuff around we are able to . 
  but to commute to work or go to the market , the public system is net superior . 
  you can use the bike here but we still have a long way to go in this regard . 
  if at any point you feel like you cant do it anymore , you can always take the public transit system and carry the bike with you there . 
  it wo n't be easy to do ( no special designated places for it ) but it 's doable . 
  my daily work commute would take 20mins by car or 30 by trams . 
  i do lose 20 minutes each day , but i dont get any nerves from dealing with the traffic and i can read/watch a movie on my way to work . 
  i also do n't have to bother with finding a parking space . 
  ** edit : ** i dont see the need for a car . 
  i can get to anywhere i want in the city using the public system , it 's a lot cheaper and depending on the hour , even a lot faster . 
  bran is ... ok . 
  nothing special tbh , its a regular castle . 
  made the locals rich with all the dracula shit going on , but other than that , it `` ok-ish '' at best . 
  good one !, 
  but germany only does that when they are involved in a war . 
  til, 
  thats awesome :d . only the russians can bring a rock song , army coir , an accordion and somehow make it work . 
  all politics aside , it sounds awesome : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u06jlgpmtqs i have no idea what the words mean , but the melody is nice . 
  go for the full version of it , well worth the time investment : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoh_h6yxgii, 
  i do n't know exactly . 
  could be that most of the former socialist countries had a skilled but poor medium wealth population . 
  they had the know-how to create the networks and operate them , but lacked the money to purchase the service from a dedicated isp . 
  also , lack of regulations or indifference in regards to cable management or piracy meant that creating your own lan had no downside to it . 
  also , in a lot of eastern countries knowing `` stuff '' is traditionally considered something to aspire to . 
  the `` nerds '' here never experienced the same social stigma as they seem to have ( had ) in us . 
  i remember when i was young , the `` hard core '' older guys in my neighborhood were always polite and civil to the folks who helped them out with networks and stuff like this . 
  they got it later , i cant say when because i 've lived all my life in bucharest . 
  but right now , most of the villages ( excepting maybe the remote ones in the mountains ) have decent internet . 
  if they have cable tv , they have at least a 50mb/s line . 
  i think the 50mb/s is the lowest speed offered at this point here . 
  but the 3g coverage is pretty good here so almost everywhere you go you have access to internet anyway . 
  no , this was the case when things got started , between lets say 2006-2009 .
