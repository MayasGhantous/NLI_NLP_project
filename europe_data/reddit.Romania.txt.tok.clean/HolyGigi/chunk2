  but for at least 5-6 years most of the people here have real 100mb lines and in the last year many have switched to 1gb . 
  wow , thanks for the gold and i 'm glad you liked the post !, 
  hm , i would say about 10 years ago , giver or take . 
  do n't remember for certain , but i found this on a quick google : ( http://forum.computergames.ro/86-networking-internet/64579-retele-de-cartier-unde-si-cum.html ) . 
  its in romanian so do n't bother unless you use google translate . 
  its basically a discussion that goes something like : - `` hey we have 10 computers around this address , anyone else want to join '' - `` oh , we are are 100m away and have 20 computers , lets get a cable over , anyone knows how we can get the cable over the power lines between the flats ? '', 
  yeah , so about 2003 is when things started, 
  most of the networks in romania are on fiber optics . 
  latency is not an issue , its like google fiber in us . 
  except we have a few places that ** do n't ** have it yet ( middle of the mountains ) , and you have a few that do have . 
  serious short answer ? 
  piracy . 
  we started out like any other country , with dial-up lines and 14440 or if you were lucky , 56k modems . 
  the state company that owns the landlines , romtelecom , had crazy expensive internet during the day , but after 10pm it was 10 times cheaper . 
  this period lasted about 2 years and a few people got to experience what internet actually meant . 
  the first real networks we had did not have access to internet , were basically big lans within an apartment complex . 
  this way , most of the people could play diablo2 , quake2 , or starcraft via lan - even if the game was pirated , direct connection via ip worked . 
  people realized that being in a network was cool , you could download a song on dial-up ( took about 1 hour with a 14400dial up connection ) and share it instantly with your neighbor . 
  he would download another song and you would get that one from him . 
  the flats stated to link up with each other and created `` neighborhood networks '' . 
  still no internet , we are now in about year 2 of dial-up being available in romania . 
  adsl made an appearance but it was too expensive for most people , so it all but vanished in leas than a year . 
  these networks had to be maintained by someone ( keep the switch plugged in , repair the cable that someone from the 6th floor cut because it look bad hanging near his window , link the network with others , etc ) so the local sys admin job was created . 
  since they were getting regular , small payments , they decided to bring the real internet and make more money . 
  you could pay `` x '' for lan , or `` x + y '' for lan and internet . 
  since the target customer was the kid on the next floor , the prices had to be reasonable . 
  more and more people started to get 2nd hand computers and needed software ( windows , office ) so they would pirate it . 
  yeah , its not nice , but back then , a licence for win95 was the equivalent of about 2 monthly salaries for a teacher . 
  or that of a policeman . 
  so no one , and i mean it , no one cared that the software was pirated . 
  people loved the internet because you could download movies and watch them at home . 
  you had software like dc + + that allowed you to download with 10mb/sec from others within your network . 
  and when i say download , you can read pirate . 
  i honestly think that there 's not one person in romania who used a computer at least once and never downloaded anything illegal . 
  by this time , there was at least 1 of these networks for every 50-100 people . 
  the networks started to link with each other via optical cable and would promote their speed with slogans like `` 100mbs within the city , 1mb outside '' or `` download a movie in minutes '' . 
  just in my neighborhood we had about 5 of these firms . 
  then the torrents got popular and the shit hit the fan . 
  people switched from dc + + to torrents within months and the networks had to keep up . 
  so they added more capacity and advertised better upload speeds and by this time most of the cities were connected via fiber so you could download almost anything with around 10mb/sec . 
  all in all , the switch from 56k to 100mbs took less than 2 years in the big cities . 
  extreme levels of piracy - literally , you did n't knew anyone who had a licence for anything back then - meant that the police did not care , they were pirating stuff as well . 
  ** tl ; dr ** romanians love movies , we needed a way to download them and fiber was the answer . 
  much cheaper than copper , no risk of the cables getting stolen . 
  omg i just wrote a novel !, 
  edit : thanks for the gold  . 
  also , rip my inbox . 
  btw , i 'm not saying software piracy is great . 
  i own a lot of software now and i 'm happy to pay for what i like because now i can afford it . 
  i 'm just explaining how things got started here . 
  and honestly , the companies never lost a penny because we got to download stuff for free . 
  no one could afford to legally buy the content . 
  there was never a choice between buying and pirating it . 
  this is something most people in the west dont get - we were never like `` hey , i can buy this new game , but screw it , i 'll just pirate it and keep the money '' - back then most of us did not have the money in the first place . 
  in 2003 the gdp was 2.700 $ . 
  that 's the median income for the entire year . 
  so less then 250 $ per month . 
  if you think with that income people had the option of spending 50 $ to buy a game or 15 $ to buy a dvd , you are dead wrong . 
  people had more pressing matters that needed money , like food and bills . 
  even now , the lowest income salary is at around 250 $ . 
  do you honestly think people who make so little are able to spend 150 $ for windows ? 
  buying the software is simply not an option for them . 
  also , to the people saying that this would n't work in us due to the huge size difference : who says you have to blanket the entire nation with fiber on day 1 ? 
  i agree , that 's impossible . 
  you start with areas that have a high population density and then fan out to lower and lower population density zones . 
  land , oil , same thing in the end = money, 
  1 ) nice tourist spot , lots of stuff to see and fairly cheap for what it offers . 
  lots of history , you can spend days in istanbul alone and still feel like you 're rushing . 
  being the capital of two of the greatest empires means you will always find something interesting . 
  good public transport system . 
  2 ) really friendly people , kinda annoying when they notice you 're a tourist and keep trying to sell you crap . 
  awesome food , bad beer and did i mention really friendly ? 
  3 ) if you cut all that religious crap that seems to have started in the last few years , sure . 
  4 ) cant say too much since i do n't follow your politics . 
  we have our own shitheads in romania to worry about . 
  5 ) i know he fought in ww1 , was instrumental in forming the republic after the war and also that almost everywhere you go , you will see statues or portraits of him, 
  no offence , but srpska is the worst name ever . 
  who the hell comes up with a 6 letter word where the first 5 letters are all consonants ? 
  visited cardiff last year and asked a guy in a pub why you have a dragon on the flag . 
  his face changed to shock and wonder and he went `` well , because dragons roam the valleys '' we both started laughing after that . 
  cool place, 
  uh , there was no war between romania and ussr in the 20s . 
  are you sure you 're not referring to the polish-russian war for ukraine ? 
  `` severely mistreated '' applies not only to minorities , but also to romanians during communism . 
  there 's a reason we had a revolution and ceausescu was executed . 
  a lot of people got scammed by the local police . 
  i know someone who was stopped 10km after entering the country by a police car and they asked him for a 50euro `` fine '' because he had a broken headlight . 
  he said he did n't , and one of the police officers moved to the front of the car , took out his baton and asked `` are you sure '' while pretending to hit the headlight . 
  there are a lot of similar stories , but this one happened to someone i know . 
  do n't worry , we understand . 
  you got most of our gypsies and you insist on calling them roma so the confusion is easy to make . 
  political correctness and all that shit . 
  but i 've been to uk last year for a week and never had any issues as a romanian , quite the contrary . 
  i was in reading and one of the tellers from the train station really went out of his way to help me and my girlfriend with the train tickets . 
  he looked over our plan for the day and saved us over 50 pounds in tickets . 
  another one : i was in a pub and wanted to try local beer , not the commercial stuff . 
  i ordered something that had a kangaroo as a logo ( dont ask me why , it seemed fun ) the guy filled up the glass , looked at it , asked me if i want good beer and tossed it in the sink and said `` that smelled like piss , have this other one , on me '' . 
  10/10 would come again . 
  but , keep the gypsies , we dont want them either :p, 
  we 've had german nationals in romania since forever .
