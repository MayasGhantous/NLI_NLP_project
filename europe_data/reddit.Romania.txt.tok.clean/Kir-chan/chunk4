  and i 'm not saying greece is well off , i 'm saying it 's * comparatively * well off . 
  better off than ez countries that are expected to bail them out ( this has been discussed in the previous threads , and i 'm not informed enough to bring it up again ) . 
  better off than other eu countries that will be hit with the consequences of their bad policies and their refusal to accept the terms of the bailout . 
  and greece will have those tools as well if they grexit , yet the grexit is the worst possible outcome ( and i agree with that ) . 
  i 'm also sorry , i trust the bottom line on my bills and the actual prices i see in supermarkets , stores and restaurants more than some random website on the internet with user-submitted research . 
  i do n't know where you are from , but i was comparing romania with greece , not romania with other , more developed countries where i personally know that rent is way more expensive . 
  and i did believe rent was more expensive in greece as well until now . 
  not to mention , there are other costs if you live in a richer country . 
  property taxes are higher , property itself is more expensive so loan payments when you buy a house are higher . 
  because there 's this much money involved , you also buy an insurance or three just in case . 
  because you have more income and higher standards of living , things like garbage disposal automatically become more expensive . 
  but , at the end of the month , after paying everything and buying food , * you still have more money left over * . 
  romanians spend an average of 20 % of their income on food and very rarely have any savings or insurance . 
  46 % live in poverty , where our definition of poverty is defined as ** 116eur/month ** , * not * a ridiculous figure like 600eur pensions !, 
  it 's * insulting * . 
  * only 26 % of the country can say that their wages and pensions are enough to last them for one full month . 
  * given these figures are the reality around me , i have trouble taking greece 's claims of `` humanitarian crisis '' seriously . 
  bulgaria is poorer than us . 
  i do n't think other east european countries are that far away either . 
  i do n't know about greece , but those numbers are almost wildly inaccurate for romania . 
   average monthly disposable salary ( after tax ) 1,782.61 lei riiiight . 
   basic ( electricity , heating , water , garbage ) for 85m2 apartment 423.41 lei 420 lei was my heating bill * alone * this winter . 
  and the numbers look highly suspect for greece as well . 
  so no , i 'd rather trust anecdotes from people who have gone on vacation or to work for a few weeks in greece ( yes , people like this exist ) , or more broadly , friends who live in other countries and come visit as well as my own experiences . 
  as for the second link ... the first thing people who 've been to the us mention when i ask how it was is how * cheap * everything is , so i do n't know how it 's calculated . 
  edit : i read the text below ,  statistics in eastern europe are weak . 
  well , that 's that . 
  but please , keep on believing that you have worse standards of living than the poorest eu countries and therefore should force them to give you money for your ridiculous  600 euro pensions . 
  yeah , i noticed the electricity in that guy 's list , because it was the only thing a lot higher than what we pay over here . 
  basic products , idk . 
  people i know who have been to greece said everything is cheaper there . 
  i can personally attest that most stuff is also cheaper in germany than here , especially clothing and electronics , but also food - more exactly , basic food is cheaper in germany , luxury items like pistachios are slightly cheaper here ( their property taxes are way more expensive though , and they have things like insurances ) . 
  you 'd think that prices would be highest in germany and lowest in romania , with greece in-between but closer to germany , but the market does n't work that way . 
  the `` living expenses '' argument seems like a load of bollocks . 
  i would have . 
  my sister actually bought one and she was super disappointed when she found windows on it . 
  okay , so you 're saying he said 200eur for 1 room , and i said 250eur for two rooms . 
  [ these are the prices for 1 room here ] ( http://www.anuntul.ro/anunturi-imobiliare-inchirieri/garsoniere/ ) . 
  you can find something around 100-120eur for 10mp ^ 2 i guess , but the price evens out because you 'd be living on your own there , while nobody lives alone in 200eur + apartments . 
  what i 'm saying is , your poverty line is very nearly lower middle class where i live and yet you still expect the poorer countries to bail you out because you do n't want to raise taxes . 
  bucharest is more expensive - [ here is a list of small 2 room apartments available for rent right now , in euro ] ( http://www.anuntul.ro/cauta/?m=e&amp;q=&amp;r=13&amp;c=19&amp;extra%5bsuprafata1%5d=&amp;extra%5bsuprafata2%5d=&amp;extra%5bmobilier%5d=1&amp;extra%5butilare%5d=&amp;p1=&amp;p2=&amp;m=e ) . 
  the average at a glance is 300 euro . 
  i also imagine athens is very expensive compared to the rest of greece due to being a highly popular tourist destination , so i would n't be surprised if rent there was significantly more expensive . 
  but the guy i was talking to there is also from greece . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ceu9d/give_me_the_money_or_ill_shoot_german_financial/csw1gv1 this guys says rent is 200 euro . 
  rent here for a 2 room apartment is ~ 250 euro , and around 350 for three rooms . 
  it 's also more expensive than this in bucharest . 
  according to what he says , bills also seem the same , with electricity more expensive there and gas/heating more expensive here . 
  the people who i 've known to vacation in greece said food is either the same or cheaper . 
  clothing and misc stuff is way cheaper there too . 
  so yes , they 're not at romanian level . 
  i 'll point you to this exchange : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ceu9d/give_me_the_money_or_ill_shoot_german_financial/csw1gv1 the idea that it 's somehow more expensive to live in greece is mostly a myth . 
  edit : np, 
  ^ ( that 's usually how it works though , in my experience ), 
   `` hey guys we have it rough and now our pensions are just 2x the average wage in your country instead of 6x , and we really do n't want to raise taxes to what you 're paying , maybe you could ... '' fixed . 
  well , in general . 
  i 'm not sure how much my country contributes , and i 'd be happy if it did , i 'm just ticked off about the beef thing . 
  those smallest pensions are still over 600 $ . 
  it 's just as unusual in romania . 
  you get a hand-written receipt when you ask for it at the restaurant , and then a real one after you pay . 
  yes , because the rest of eastern europe euthanizes old people / s, 
   100 electricity +40 ( and that is generous ) for heat +25 for water +30 or so for telephone 50 for electricity ( with everyone limiting electricity usage , and without things like air conditioning ) +50 for heat ( 100 during winter ) + 25 for water + 30 for phone/tv/internet / mobile sounds about right for us too , for a 3 person family . 
  a 2 room apartment is 250 euro rent . 
  all this without food . 
  what the greek sentiment reads like is  we should n't have to live like a developing country !, 
  poverty for us  poverty for you . 
  the more i read greek responses , the more this opinion strengthens . 
  everytime someone points out that living conditions are worse in other european countries that * are not * being financed to the degree greece is , you start screaming that `` living is more expensive here ! '', 
  while ignoring that living is expensive everywhere . 
  then you have #firstworldproblems like waaah my beef is romanian and not french ( yes , that is what ticked me off the most ) . 
  rent aside ( aren ` most families in greece homeowners ? 
  and you certainly do n't pay proprety taxes ) , the bills should be similar and just slightly higher . 
  raising the electricity and gas bills was one of the conditions of our own austerity , and our heating bill was  100 $ throughout winter and early spring . 
  and what i want is that you do n't accidentally end up like 90s romania while you 're throwing tantrums about having it bad * now * . 
  i do n't want you to be `` weaker '' ( whatever the hell that means ) and i 'm neutral towards your $ lending because we 're not an ez country . 
  you ca n't compare 50s germany with 660 $ = povertyline . 
  dude , your country imports food . 
  a * lot * of food . 
  i 've posted some comments that are negative of greece , but i 'm neutral on the issue and do n't think greeks are lazy or anything idiotic like that - it 's just that i 'm baffled how you can think you 're in a humanitarian crisis * now * , all the while complaining that you have to import romanian instead of french beef and that your 800 euro pensions border on poverty , but you do n't seem to realize * how bad it can get * . 
  you should have accepted the bailout , because a grexit will be disatrous for you guys - you 'll be * worse * off than 90s romania , because we at least had strong agriculture . 
  yeah , my grandmother 's pension * combined with my salary * is n't that high . 
   the average greek pension is 833 euros a month . 
  that 's down from 1,350 euros in 2009  below the poverty line of 665 euros wow . 
  the best part of that video was when the cafe owner said that he would n't get customers with a 23 % ( ! ), 
  tax rate , and then added that these days people come , drink coffee then leave without paying because they have no money . 
  the girl was n't joking though , this was said in a really sad and dramatic tone . 
  it also makes imports more expensive , and greece relies heavily on importing nearly everything . 
  god i hope so . 
  fair enough . 
  a basic one-room apartment is 100-150 euro to rent in romania 's second biggest city . 
  working there , you can expect a salary around 250-300 euro ( it depends on the job though , programmers get more ) . 
  electricity and gas are slightly cheaper than in western europe , but not by that much , let 's put all the bills for that one-room flat around 50-75 euro . 
  that usually leaves you with ~ 100 euro * for everything else - food costs the same as in the west , clothing and electronics are more expensive . 
  so any country where you can reasonably expect to have a positive amount of money left over at the end of the month living frugally has lowered living costs , when adjusted . 
  well excuse us for not acting like the beggars europe thinks we are . 
  and yet it 's greece that 's in a humanitarian crisis . 
  possibly , but the difference is important because islam is a religion with an extremely problematic philosophy that * needs * to be discussed , the same way any other religion is discussed and to the extent that christianity is . 
  some parts of the faith are fundamentally opposed to both rational discourse and basic morality , and those parts are still being practised in way too many places . 
  but having this discussion about the religion should not mean that we should talk about the people as a whole , as if * they * are incompatible with western values . 
  even if they are culturally muslims , they might practice it in a peaceful manner or cherry-pick the faith the way christians do ( cherry-picking is good ) .
