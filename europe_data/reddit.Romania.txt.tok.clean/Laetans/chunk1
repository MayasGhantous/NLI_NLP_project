you know those mig accumulators that you used to make ? 
  ... yeah well i need a few . 
   whatever you 're doing , whatever time of day or night , try to think in german sentences and correct them when you get to a dictionary or grammar . 
  never thought of that to be honest . 
  thanks for the tips !, 
  i really appreciate it :d . 
  also good luck with learning greek !, 
  we 're not vampires . 
  do you have any tips/secrets on how to learn a new language ( without living in the specific country ) ? 
  i 'm trying to learn german ( and planning to learn arabic ) but i find it very dificult for some reason . 
  also thanks for the ama !, 
  then what are we ? 
  more like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/wcwm_1hbu_c?t=55s ) since they are hungarians, 
  yeah , here in transylvania the majority has a pretty positive opinion about hungary . 
  not the same can be said for the rest of romania tho . 
  rush b !, 
  rush b !!!!, 
  cyka blyat noobs !!, 
  here sexual education is still a taboo subject and it 's not taught in school , while religious education is mandatory 12 years ( or at least was until last year ) . 
  i imagine it 's the same case in hungary and russia . 
  in poland abortion is banned unless the pregnancy is caused by rape ; woman 's life is endangered or the fetus is malformed . 
  yet nobody asks why most muslim countries are so awful to their own kin ... 
  it must be hungary 's fault again tho . 
  that still does n't mean much . 
  ukraine , mexico , russia all have a low english proficiency and those countries too have english as mandatory . 
  while arabic countries are pretty infamous for having the lowest rate of all the countries in the world when it comes to proficiency in english [ source ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/14-ef-epi_infographic-map.jpg ) of course they may be able to speak and understand a bit due to western influences but i highly doubt the majority can write by using the latin alphabet . 
  well it kinda is at least 60 % germany 's fault we became communist in the first place tbh . 
  every ex-communist country is earning shit in their country . 
  just look at the unemployment in eastern germany . 
  reminds me of lord of the flies, 
   the past week or so / r/europe [ 1 ] has gone from being quite a friendly place where europeans ( and non europeans ) had nice discussions about europe and european affairs . 
  i guess we already forgot about how much hate russians got until like 5 month ago ? 
  glad to see that i 'm not the only one that voted for russia . 
  why would any woman join isis tho ? 
  we do n't want them anyway tbh . 
  i suppose they do n't have zebra crossings in syria . 
  romania i love it because of the people who live here . 
  i hate it because of the people who live here . 
   why an influx of new blood would be a shot in the arm for the aging continent . 
  if europe 's population is aging then governments or eu should promote and support eu citizens who want to have more than 2 children , a chinese child policy but reversed with certain requirements ofcourse . 
  there are millions upon millions of people in europe that want a lot of children but they settle down at 1 or 2 children because it 's expensive to have more . 
  most people settle in their own house around the age of 30-35 + which is way too late to successfully produce offsprings it 's a lot easier to do this than to accept large numbers of immigrants that are too culturally different and will never integrate until a lot of generations pass . 
  most immigrants from the middle east and africa will inevitably be not educated enough to ever compete in the current job market and will only continue their statute of poverty and will inevitably cause more harm to the current economical situation of a country . 
  that during the the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 the ussr attacked us for refusing to participate but it ok because we had [ laser weapons ] ( http://www.realitatea.net/realitatea-net-va-prezinta-conspiratii-celebre-episodul-14-laserul-lui-coanda-arma-secreta-a-romaniei_652497.html ) . 
  we obviously had a flawlessly victory . 
  pronouncing it makes me sound like i 'm having a severe stroke, 
  i guess years of smoking weed can really affect your sanity, 
  you have to also realize that nato and the eu are n't sending jets just because the baltic needs them . 
  they are also sending them for their own benefits aswell . 
  also eu pours a lot of money into poland , romania and other countries because they have the potential to develop and contribute in the same vain as france or germany in the future . 
  since we are talking about languages [ here is a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3kzibhn8o ) of 32 newscasters speaking in their own language, 
  [ sounds like hungarian to me ] ( https://youtu.be/yvkuucw-iok?t=36s ), 
  belarus is pretty much one of the only dictatorial states left in europe . 
  despite the fall of the ussr they still kept the soviet policies and refused the `` shock therapy '' that other ex-communist countries went through . 
  their key industry is pretty much state controlled and they are also dependent on russia since there is were most of their export goes . 
  their president is alexander lukashenko and has been so since 1994 . 
  when the fall of the ussr was clear he was one of the only deputy that voted against belarus ' independence . 
  his whole regime is based on the soviet nostalgia . 
  [ he is pro union with russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state ) and anti-eu . 
  but in recent years he became a very strong critic of russia 's invasion of crimea among the ex soviet states and made some rather praising remarks of hitler 's dictatorship . 
   greece 's is fully committed to serve  greece 's is fully committed  greece 's is fully  greece 's is this is an official letter godammit, 
  poor latvia no tech and definitely no potatoes, 
  i do n't understand how the eu still does n't consider this to be an issue . 
  illegal immigrants are just that , people who cross the border of a country illegally . 
  eu 's constant acceptance will not only supports such acts but it will also support a rising mafia based on human trafficking in africa but also in europe , i highly doubt that 20 % of the current illegal immigrants came willingly and that they 're not part of something much darker . 
  also do n't you think people from moldova , ukraine , morroco and at least 5 million people of turkey 's 77 million want to cross the borders aswell for a better life ? 
  yet they do n't do it because they know the consequences as a whole for crossing the border , what kind of message does eu send for those people ? 
  people keep bringing the whole `` italy 's economy is better now with the added immigrants '' story is n't a good argument . 
  there are many factors that influence an economy and a few hundreds of thousand immigrants from no to barely any form of education wo n't change much . 
  i 'm not against immigration i just strongly believe that they should be regulated with extreme care and that they should take a strong stance when it comes to illegal immigration and not tolerate it . 
  damn ... and here i thought that the swedes and germans were the least tolerated ethnic group in europe . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge9l9ixjfx8 ) also a video about the same thing, 
  it reminds me of our [ presidential election ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/alegeri_preziden%c8%9biale_%c3%aen_rom%c3%a2nia,_2014#/media/file:alegeri_prezidentiale_in_romania_2014,_turul_2.png ), 
  and the iron man cartoon will have it 's own russian spinoff called `` stalin '' on the new tv channel . 
  when space is sending their aliens they are not sending their best !, 
   we can easily justify it because the most influencing our politician is now a slovak and more and more slovaks move here . 
  why not just reunite then ? 
  ukraine and georgia are n't nato member . 
  and to be fair ukraine always was very close to russia until recently . 
  now they are afraid of us `` flexing our muscles '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_mountain_brigade_ ( ukraine ), 
  the hungarian [ census of 1941 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_hungary#from_1938_to_1945 ) declared inheriting around 1 million romanians but yeah i do understand what you mean . 
  coming up with such data , especially during that period would of been extremely difficult . 
   none of which were romanian majority territories . 
  it 's hard to argue that borders were badly drawn in all countries after austria-hungary broke up . 
  [ they kinda were tho ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/recens%c4%83m%c3%a2ntul_din_1930#/media/file:romania_1930_ethnic_map.png ) . 
   there was heavy anti-communist sentiment there were anti-russian/soviet sentiments not communist since the iron guard appealed a lot more to the working class than communism , we did n't have a strong communist movement . 
  the only movement that i can think of was [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatarbunary_uprising ) which did n't get much support from the romanian population, 
   well why exactly ? 
  transylvania was part of the austrian empire for the longest time . 
  [ anti-romanian sentiments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-romanian_sentiment#kingdom_of_hungary_and_austria-hungary ) [ 1848 massacre of transylvanian minorities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1848%e2%80%9349_massacres_in_transylvania )  nazi germany was allied with romania during wwii 1 . 
  [ molotov -- ribbentrop pact which lead to us loosing bassarabia and bukovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) 2 . 
  [ second vienna award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award ) in which nazi germany , italy and hungary forced romania to cede southern dobrogea to bulgaria and northern transylvania to hungary which in turn lead to small hungarian raids like the [ treznea massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treznea_massacre ) . 
  [ german -- romanian treaty for the development of economic relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93romanian_treaty_for_the_development_of_economic_relations_between_the_two_countries_ ( 1939 \\ ) ) which left romania with giving most of it 's production to germany for `` technical know-how and military equipment which might be required . '', 
  while at the same time isolating itself from the world market and becoming dependent on nazi germany 4 . 
  nazi germany [ funding ] ( http://countrystudies.us/romania/21.htm ) the iron guard 5 . 
  i would argue that even helping antonescu ascend to power ( even tho he was n't a pro-nazi ) knowing he 's an extreme anti-communist figure and would continue the campaign beyond the nistru which was n't first intended . 
  just like finland we did n't join nazi germany because we wanted to but because we did n't have a choice mixed with carol ii 's terrible administration . 
  due to our position and oil reserves being neutral or joining anything else but the axis wa n't an option . 
  ofc today the relations are a totally different story . 
   germany - 9.2 % i 'm amazed it 's that high tbh considering our history .
