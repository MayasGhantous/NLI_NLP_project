next stop : romania . 
  this whole migrant crisis is a plot by the romanian government to get hungary fenced in . 
   2 : i was n't talking down on you i was in disbelieve with the comment above saying that romania was n't able to handle 1875 refuggee . 
  small clarification : the romanian president ** proposed ** the 1,875 quota . 
  the ** eu proposal ** is to make it about 6,000 people . 
  i realize even that does n't look like a huge amount , but the opinion is very split at the moment . 
   v.v. 
  ponta has joined the server everyone else quits , claims he is cheating . 
  he is , 
   every country does that in some way . 
  even germany has reinstated border controls ( albeit selective ) . 
  the comparison with germany does n't really make sense here . 
  not because they are bigger and richer - the reason can be seen when looking at a map ... 
   however , when croatia sent migrants to hungary , the authorities had the logistic support in place so it 's clear there has been some discussion . 
  i think the hungarian government simply predicted the course of events ( croatia would n't be able to handle the numbers ) and made preparations . 
   also it 's surprising hungary decided to let them in . 
  your government needs to partially appease the international community while this goes on , they are being portrayed as the black sheep of europe . 
  once the croatian fence is in place , they will be able to deter passage without resorting to excessive violence . 
  what part of romania is that ? 
  never seen this happen in banat or transilvania , 
  do you know who the king of norway is , though ? 
  it seems to me that except the queen of england , the rest of the royal houses are pretty much unknown outside of their immediate vicinity . 
  we will manage faster growth when we get the village population to take part in trade , and apply for funding and use proper agricultural implements instead of plowing with cows . 
  unfortunately a lot of the economy in the villages is subsistence , and the peasants i have talked to ( my grandfather included ) are still remembering forced collectivization - my grandpa talked about it every time he would look at his land - so they are resistant to any change . 
  you can also visit romania . 
  we do n't bite ... during the day . 
  angels on horses , bit of an overkill . 
  makes sense we would steal the horses . 
  i think we would like being called conquistadors , though . 
  let 's go with that version then , 
  thank you for the information !, 
  any particular reason norway would be so enthusiastic about it ? 
  is it simply being satisfied with the status quo , or are there factual advantages ? 
  those others are a lot less enthusiastic about their monarchy , though . 
  anyway , i was poking fun with the no brits part . 
  we 'll get that visa-free program , and make you pay for the changes !, 
  got it . 
  i agree . 
   im ginger ... well this is embarrassing . 
  see , i was right to ask for no brits  ( there is a running joke that he is not charles ' real son due to the color of his hair , and thus not entitled to the throne ), 
   i never understood why it was that important issue same comment at the same time . 
  our nations are finally starting to see some sense , 
   who were in the carpathian basin first : romanians or hungarians . 
  i have yet to understand why it matters so much . 
  what would it change ? 
  would transylvania all of the sudden become part of hungary if they were first ? 
  would we kick out all magyars living here if it was us ? 
  such a silly topic to be emotional about ... 
   he has no chance of becoming king yes , he is ginger (, 
  american spelling , to deter the brits :p, 
  i 'll go buy a bottle of maple syrup to honor my new subjects . 
  you are too emotionally involved to discuss the topic , i feel :p, 
   luciwiz is , in fact , the elected romanian king . 
  keep spamming this text , i want google to give me the honor i so much deserve !, 
   are we really not ready to put such paternalistic ideas behind us ? 
  sadly it seems like we are n't , but i hope that is the path we are headed . 
   but is a more democratic system automatically better ? 
  what do we actually gain ? 
  it 's also more democratic to have a free vote for every issue ever decided by government but many would argue that such a system would be incredibly worse . 
  the relevant difference is that you get periodic elections . 
  the people can decide who best represents them , and at least in romania this is pretty showing of how the nation feels about the world and the direction they want to head on . 
  for instance , we just elected a sober german ethnic who does n't speak much , after the always too colorful ex-navy captain . 
  quite a turn , and not a coincidence . 
   it 's the parliament who makes decisions over the line of succession . 
  no real king decides this . 
  they are not `` acting '' monarchy in romania . 
  just the historical ex-monarchy , they do n't even live in romania . 
  the parliament does n't really give a shit about their line of succession . 
  yes , your king seems nice , i got to admit . 
  but you have no guarantee about his offsprings :p the non-political part : very interesting . 
  i have n't considered that angle . 
  perhaps this is the reasons a small part of romanians still consider a monarchy . 
  we hate politicians with a vengeance . 
  i just hate hereditary nobility more . 
   you would not become king if you married the queen . 
  if you married her and killed her , charles would become king . 
  well , that is disappointing . 
  i do agree that having your life chosen for you sucks , though . 
  harry still seems to have fun , but he is 4th in line , so i guess his life is more relaxed . 
   you could n't even post on reddit any more , in case you offended somebody and messed up romania 's reputation . 
  i could pick an anonymous username , such as `` luciwiz '' , 
   the rumour goes that it 's because he 's gay . 
  what ? 
  i thought it was because he was involved in business ? 
  thanks , i kind of agree with everything you said . 
  btw , are n't canadians her royal subjects ? 
  hehe . 
  i think it is profoundly undemocratic that there is a state `` job '' ( as limited as it is , basically just ceremonial ) that people can not access , no matter what they do ; bar the intricate plan of marrying the queen and having her killed , but i digress . 
  basically , if there is a job which allows me to knight people , i want in . 
  maybe someone can explain to me monarchy in the 21st century . 
  no brits , 
  nice fish , up voted . 
  hey , hungarian women are awesome :p, 
   why do n't you just make your own economic succes instead of leeching of others . 
  i was not suggesting leeching ... why would you think that ? 
  romania is not even in the eurozone , this would not benefit us until we are at a gdp closer to that of the western countries , as i explained . 
  a fiscal union would provide the tools to control fiscal policy and stabilize the eurozone . 
  the current system is one of applying fines to members who misbehave ( as they have the opportunity to ignore agreed-upon fiscal rules ) , and this system predictably fails . 
  germany and france were not even fined for it - being the largest economies has its perks . 
  this affects countries in the eurozone such as netherlands a lot more than it does us .
