  joking ... the last dictator we had ( he expected romanians to be loyal ) was executed after the revolution . 
  and the revolution started with the communists trying to evict [ l\u00e1szl\u00f3 t\u0151k\u00e9s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l\u00e1szl\u00f3_t\u0151k\u00e9s ), 
  [ serviciul de protectie si paza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gabozusi7ig ) ( romanian secret service ) some stills with the [ romanian special forces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afwp14vt7y8 ) [ selection process for the special forces ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spirm90xvmo ) ( narration in romanian ), 
   im sure hes perfectly ok with anyone who is loyal to him yeah , we get kind of jumpy and tend to [ execute people like that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trial_of_nicolae_and_elena_ceau\u0219escu#execution ) . 
  and it 's the [ magyar ethnics instigating us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_ceau\u0219escu#timi.c8.99oara ) , so that spells double trouble for poor viktor . 
   and you 'll be saved from everything evil by our savior orb\u00e1n . 
  pretty sure his definition of evil includes romanians , 
   not they , we . 
  welcome to the family , luci . 
   i moved from timisoara to cluj , so i would be assimilated anyway  hungarians are cool , so i am fine either way , as long as i do n't have to speak this atrocious language . 
   russia : fuck you , give our gold back pls the `` pls '' is a nice touch , 
  oh , they even get timisoara now ? 
   romanians and albanians are stupid people that can do two jobs : build houses and steal . 
  but do we do it well ? 
  that is all that matters to us , 
  we call it `` cehia '' , and the people are `` cehi '' . 
  it sounds pretty rad in romanian , i suggest you adopt it . 
  and no real resemblance to `` cecenia '' . 
  let 's just be thankful romania is not mentioned , maybe we get rid of our `` fame '' , as other countries come under fire , 
  i have been to slovakia skying a few times , most people around here know it best because it was part of czechoslovakia and they broke apart a longer time ago . 
  i have never been to slovenia , so i know almost nothing about you guys . 
  it is on my travel list , though . 
  i doubt most people around here confuse the two , but i ca n't be sure . 
  never happened to me , 
   estonia ( 2.04 ) , greece ( 2.46 ) , poland ( 2.18 ) , uk ( 2.07 ) , and usa ( 3.62 ) are the only nato members who meet the 2 % contribution . 
  we will [ start doing it next year ] ( http://uatoday.tv/politics/romania-to-raise-defence-spending-to-2-of-gdp-in-2017-403287.html ) . 
   why so few guns ? 
  ( in comparison ) the population is generally against hunting , and we do n't need them for self-defense , because would-be attackers do n't have guns either . 
   if we have problems with our neighbors we just use a bat . 
  or maybe an axe if we want to get fancy . 
  like real men . 
  that is interesting , thank you for the information . 
  how long is the trip ? 
  i guess there are 2 reasons i would n't have thought of that . 
  first , because i live in the north-west , so i am farther away . 
  second , because i do n't drive , 
  not only from constanta , but yeah , agreed . 
  i guess salami-tactics might work easier . 
  `` please , just aerial and nautical , no big deal '' . 
  later : `` come on , we already have aerial and nautical , what 's the big deal ? 
  i think the government proposed a `` lite-ascension '' as a first step , which would involve the aerial and nautical borders only . 
  not sure how much transport of goods is done via plane , but the danubian transportation is quite sizable . 
  perhaps i am misinformed then . 
  well , the romanian people were happy to have had it in place , otherwise politicians would never have done it out of their own accord . 
  enlargement of scope makes sense , but i doubt most other countries would go with . 
  can you imagine the current hungarian government doing it ? 
   northern greece is full of serbians , romanians , and bulgarians during the summer . 
  romanians fly to greece , do n't know about the rest . 
  i think it would be more expensive to go by car , though i might be wrong . 
  all the romanian tourists you see in bulgaria are actually vacationing in bulgaria , 
   we also live in caves and drink human blood . 
  if i were you , i would n't risk it . 
  we do n't live in caves . 
   and here i am , everyone warning me to go on a solo motociclete trip through romania because i will be robbed , abducted and tortured to death ... every day . 
  or will i ? 
  ;  i do n't know any tourism agency that caters to such exquisite demands , but i will look around . 
  the `` death every day '' request will surely cost extra . 
  we do n't want it removed , it 's just that this is the last mandatory requirement for joining schengen ( until they come up with another one ) . 
  we would prefer this mechanism to be implemented for every country , and especially for companies activating multi-nationally . 
  for instance , germany has low level of corruption , but german companies are the most bribing-happy organisations i have seen . 
   `` knock knock knocking on schengen 's door '' - bulgaria , romania and roses damn , you actually made me search youtube for the song , i thought it was a funny spoof or something . 
   best-looking one is the romanian imo . 
  i think we were going for intimidating-looking when we elected him . 
  but ownership of guns through the general population is very restricted - which we like , actually . 
  what happens if i do it , while living in another country , and then visit poland ? 
  do i get nabbed at the airport by hussars ? 
   belarus , a landlocked country , became a major exporter of such goods as shrimps and salmon to russia . 
  that is both awesome and hilarious . 
  he will then climb on his unicorn and disappear beneath the stars . 
   clearly the country 's collective new year 's resolution is to not murder anyone anymore . 
  let 's hope it lasts more than getting back in shape resolutions . 
   russia 's security doctrine is based on controlling states around its border since there are no natural defences in form of rivers , oceans , deserts or mountains . 
  neither does germany . 
  that 's not an excuse . 
  trump has not been elected yet , and i doubt that clown would become president of the united states . 
  he is worse than bush . 
   in russia it 's renault , not dacia . 
  why is that ? 
   this comes from the country that sends every romany people they have to the rest of europe . 
  what does , the question `` do you have a new government '' ? 
  what do you think it means ? 
   and ee will get all the blood :( we like blood . 
  granted , that is a valid way of looking at the matter . 
  but i feel like the point of the article was to describe to the audience whom kasyanov is , like when they say `` russia 's putin '' , they will describe a leader of an opposition party who runs for presidency as `` putin 's opponent '' . 
  in this context , if they said `` kadyrov 's opponent '' we would have thought he is running in chechnya , which is not the case . 
  i do n't know the details of internal russian politics , so that may all be true . 
  still , since he is ( or intends to ) run for office for putin 's position , he is putin 's opponent . 
  if he was running for kadyrov 's position , then you would be right . 
  `` opponent '' in this context does not mean `` enemy '' , which kadyrov may well be . 
   so , kadyrov 's opponent then . 
  not putin 's . 
  what do you mean ? 
  kasyanov was the prime minister of russia , he tried to run for president but he was refused registration . 
  he is not running against kadyrov , he is putin 's opponent . 
  i am sure you know all that , so perhaps i am missing your point ? 
   do you have examples of other eu countries that could enforce a law allowing them to silence critics of the gov with fines just for criticizing the gov and got away with it ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  is this what the law does ? 
  i read it ( in romanian ) and it has nothing to do with this , at least to my understanding . 
  it only applies to defamation of people for being part of a ( disadvantaged ) social group , which is defined as the following ( i copied the translation from [ jondevries ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/jondevries ) , posted below ) :  according to the new text , social group will be defined as follows : ` category of people who are distinguished in terms of capital through one or more traits gender , age , race , religion , ethnicity , native language , cultural traditions , orientation sex , social origin , property , disability , non-contagious chronic illness or hiv / aids .
