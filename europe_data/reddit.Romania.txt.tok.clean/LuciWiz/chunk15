  i do n't see how it would be applied to members of gov. 
  so i could say to an mp `` you are a thief because you are in the parliament and everybody in the parliament is a stinking piece of shit '' and nothing would happen to me according to the law . 
  of course , i still do not support and will fight against it if it becomes law . 
  which i highly doubt . 
  as far as i know you get fined and ** even imprisoned ** in several countries for denying the holocaust . 
  we are nowhere near that level , and comparing us to hungary in this case is not warranted . 
  why would the eu disagree ? 
  i think a law like this already exists in many western european countries . 
  if anything , perhaps they would request it be put in place . 
  let 's hope it does n't get implemented in romania . 
  assuming you live in a western european country , chances are you already have this law in place ( it is a defamation law ) . 
  let 's hope romania does n't follow this trend . 
  i mean no offense , but this seems like a childish attitude . 
  romania is doing very well out of the trade relationship with germany as it is . 
  we have a lot of people buying luxury cars ( second hand ! ), 
  from germany out of their life earnings , rather than investing them in something worthwhile , which is the main reason we still have a slight deficit with you guys . 
   is it ? 
  i 'd like to think so but / u/ganymede07011610 is working some serious overtime here to try to make out that it is n't . 
  he still only gets one vote . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's just that the discourse seems too much skewed towards the negative . 
  the eu is an easy target for directing complaints at , but i doubt most people who understand the consequences would really want to leave it . 
  pushing for reform is a healthy action , in contrast . 
  thank you !, 
  at least on reddit we can talk back . 
  we do n't send them anywhere mate , they are `` travelers '' and we are happy for them to travel , 
  oh , i do n't own a tv for over 13 years . 
  it broke when i was a student and i just postponed buying another one . 
  brutal , 
   thank you slovakia , hungary , romania and bulgaria for being a good market for our products . 
  and thank you germany for [ buying almost as much back from us as we buy from you ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rou/ ) . 
  the common market is awesome , everyone stands to benefit if they work hard and are honest . 
  if someone were trapped in their apartment and formed their view on reality by reading this sub ( or a significant part of the press , to be honest ) , that person would not want to go outside  i do n't get it ; for the past 25 years , everything has been improving non-stop !, 
  it seems like mass depression to me . 
   surprisingly it felt pretty safe when i was visiting . 
  it depends where you go . 
  cluj-napoca is as safe as any western europe city i have been to , but there are more aggressive cities and towns . 
  i think worst-case scenario i have heard from foreigners was getting cheated on the taxi fair . 
  the germans and the dutch are the only ones i have seen getting in an argument ( in their language ! ), 
  with the driver , and paying a lower fair . 
  according to a report from march last year , romanians were the [ most optimistic about the future of the eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/romania/news/16032015_eurobarometru_romanii_cea_mai_mare_incredere_in_eu_ro.htm ) . 
  when reading the comments in this thread i thought the romanian posters are not at all representative of that report , but on closer inspection it appears to be just one hyper-active poster , 
  i assume he would n't get into that position by being dumb ; my point is he is in no way a good diplomat , unless trolling is seen as proper display of diplomacy in russia . 
  well , lately it starts to seem that way ... 
   i think most greeks and most spaniards do n't ... perhaps , as they were doing well before joining the eu . 
  like it or not , the eu has been a godsend for romania . 
  and that is not because of the money we get , like westerners like to say in every thread , that does n't matter in the grand scheme of things . 
  we were pushed into fighting corruption ( at the high level , police and other institutions are still harboring human scum ) , we were pushed into implementing critical legislation . 
  let 's admit the leaders we inherited from the old regime are far worse than the country deserves . 
  being part of the eu helps us overcome this , in time . 
  maybe we will be in a position to not ** need ** the eu at some point in time , but now is not it , not by far . 
  do you run a business , or work for a business that exports in the eu ? 
  have you seen the huge change in moving from talks to signing an actual deal since being in the eu ? 
  did you notice how even american companies are put at ease when you mention the country is part of the eu and the same standards of doing business apply ? 
  we are not at the level of the uk or norway right now , to be able to enter into profitable deals with the eu from the outside . 
  perhaps my advice is unwelcome , but your comments would make a lot more sense if you displayed some sense of proportion . 
  at least that is my opinion . 
   but whatever , go ahead and leave the eu for some petty ass reasons and see how it works out for you . 
  you are not replying to the president of romania , just so you know , 
   how would you expect them to be conducted ? 
  with courtesy . 
  i think most romanians agree . 
  all i know are the [ threats he made to romania ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/10/russian-minister-threatens-to-fly-bomber-jet-into-romania/ ) , which were taken really seriously around here and have severely damaged the relationship between the countries . 
  i would n't have expected discussions between leaders at this level to be conducted in this manner . 
  looks like i am living in a fairy tale world . 
   if this were true , the economy would have collapsed in 2014 . 
  sergey shoygu , ** dmitry rogozin ** , sergey lavrov are just a few of the many experienced and knowledgeable diplomats russia has . 
  do you really consider dmitry rogozin to be a knowledgeable diplomat ? 
  just to clarify , he wants to `` annex '' the part of romania called moldova into the republic of moldova . 
  yeah , 
  yes , like wtf is this guy talking about ? 
  maybe you should join a support group or something ... what do you expect to accomplish with internet rants ? 
  as we worked in foreign corporations that brought their business to romania ( german , american etc. 
  ) , one of the toughest lessons to learn was how to give , but even more importantly how to take , positive feedback . 
  we would just sit there being praised and feel embarrassed , not knowing what to do with our hands . 
  teaching people to accept feedback for improvement was easier - though we did , and sometimes still do , tend to take it more personally than other cultures . 
  i believe we still find it hard to interact with dutch people . 
  thank you . 
  i expected this to be more of a concern for nato , but there you have it . 
   there 's another player in the game with a long history of pan-slavism granted , i guess cis can be seen as a significant rival . 
  i would still be amazed if this played an important role in romania 's eu ascension , i expected it to be more about gaining a larger population , which in one decade or two could become an important market and even contributor . 
  do you know of some published literature that makes this claim with more data ? 
  also , sorry about assuming your knowledge of geography was at a toddler level , 
  we just enjoy complaining too much , good fortune hinders it . 
  why , though ? 
  does the eu want ex-yugoslavia in ? 
  no problem , they would be more than happy to oblige , no encircling necessary . 
  i apologize if i am being thick here , i just do n't understand your argument . 
  actually , romania contributes more to the budget than hungary , thanks to the higher population . 
  why would that be a factor in admitting new countries in the eu ? 
  if it were important , migrants would be going through bulgaria and romania , but they do n't , they would much rather take the shorter route . 
  and you are grossly overestimating the importance the eu gives to greece ( no offense to greece ) . 
  you may want to have a look at a map . 
  i must say , that is a strange request . 
  perhaps they accept to incur the risk for the fluctuations of the monetary rate , in exchange for their customers accepting the clause of payments in euro ? 
  i ca n't imagine iran specifically * wishes * to assume the risk , it does n't seem to make any sense . 
  ca n't you pick on the asians for a change ? 
   he needs romanian citzenship afaik . 
  that 's an easy fix . 
  quite the contrary .
