   in italian a villa is a country house . 
  similar to romanian . 
   wiktionary is useful for etimology . 
  how do i not know about this ? 
   apparently maison comes from latin `` mansionem '' interesting , i was n't able to find information on its etymology via google . 
  thanks for the information , i like to research my jokes , 
  france ca n't into romance , 
  i hope we anschluss these guys , their accent is adorable . 
  all right lads , we should easily win this one . 
  show them how it 's done . 
   still waiting for a positive neutral / u/dngrs comment on any hungary-related article . 
  honestly , `` who cares '' seems as neutral as you could get , 
   do they make problems for romanians though ? 
  it 's a joke between romanians and hungarians , you would n't get it ... 
   uhh , whops . 
  to be fair , they used a shitty color to represent the b 's group , and stronger color equates in the brain as more shitty , 
   how can belarus have a better rating than russia ? 
  that seems weird . 
  what do you mean ? 
  russia has bb and belarus has b on the linked graphic . 
  lighter shades are worse . 
  literally `` romania '' ? 
  no cool name , like `` llomaniwa '' or something ? 
   1956 oct 26 best day of my life !, 
  i googled it and apparently rita wilson was born that day . 
  brilliant !, 
   what 's next ? 
  team up with poland and go into space ? 
   regardless of the final score we won !, 
  :p haha , seems like you lost the game , mate , 
   of course it 's about nokia ... 
  it is a finnish newspaper , they would write about things of interest for their audience  i just do n't get what they mean about the football team reaching the champions league in this context ... do they think nokia brought football players ? 
   why is the netherlands always the odd one out in all these maps . 
  it 's the only one that has a very literal translation : `` tarile de jos '' = `` the countries below ' . 
  is it just me , or does my country look incredible well on the map ? 
  with all the latest map posts , i remembered how cute this little fat fish looks . 
  scandinavians must be salivating . 
   why the hell do n't they use `` britania '' ? 
  because , in romanian , the form of the substantive changed when qualified by the adjective `` great '' ( `` mare '' ) ** before ** the substantive . 
  though this it would be a ( somewhat ) literal translation of `` the great britain '' , and not of `` great britain '' . 
  so apparently we respect you a lot  for example , you would say `` great romania '' as `` romania mare '' , but you would say `` the great romania '' as `` marea romani ** e ** '' ,, 
   actually , apparently yes . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the project is not going through . 
  do you know of some new developments ? 
   romania have industrial amounts of raw gold and let foreigners dig it ? 
  oookay . 
  apparently not , 
  russia is an antagonist power in the region . 
  they use tricks , such as `` vacationing citizens '' to bring death and instability to neighboring countries , whether they used to be allies or not . 
  i assume you live in a country which is far enough ( geographically ) to not be immediately concerned about this horrible country . 
  i support poland 's efforts to ensure its security against the russian cancer ... 
   yea but thats cuz we are evil :( it started out like that , but now i think it is an advantage for germany , and i assume you would n't want them to leave ( that 's what my german friends tell me at least ) . 
   you know how stupid putin gets when he perceives a threat : / i think he reacts strongly when there is a threat he can easily destroy . 
  if the threat is significant , he will just cry in interviews or do fly-by 's . 
  that 's the whole point , russia ca n't be reasoned with unless you make a show of force . 
  sad but true . 
   allowing the usa to place weapons within their borders endangers all of the eu . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the us even troops stationed in germany , what is poland doing that is different ? 
   it 's dying down a bit now , but there always used to be users with romanian flair bitching about the uk in any uk thread . 
  they were from chad , mate . 
  congratulations lithuanians !, 
  i remember the time our parents faced ( our own ) armed forces to gain freedom . 
  it takes so much guts , and it defines nations . 
  never again . 
   beautiful . 
  can we see even more photos ? 
  [ his trip to mongolia ] ( http://bmwblog.ro/2010/09/24/interviu-in-exclusivitate-mihai-barbu-mongolia-ro-pana-in-mongolia-si-inapoi/ ), 
   well , at least you do n't get killed if you write wrong kind of article , but you might get fired , demonised and socially ostracized . 
  so nothing serious , 
   romania ca n't issue schengen-visa to people who are n't eligible but pay a bribe . 
  i did n't consider that . 
  would this be a case for non-romanian citizens ? 
  ( like , let 's say an afghan coming to romania and applying for schengen visa without meeting the requirements ), 
   off job you should be allowed to express your opinions . 
   [ ... ] this of course should n't interfere with your duty . 
  i agree , i did n't word my statement precisely enough . 
  but the person in question seems to have failed both points you made . 
   so many romanian flags . 
  i 'm having trouble keeping track of you all . 
  we are here to have our traditional circle-jerk feeling sorry for ourselves , and you interrupted it . 
  so there will be some repressed anger thrown your way , but it 's just blowing steam , do n't take it to heart ( not that you have a heart , you monster !, 
   we find your rule of law threatening . 
  i understand this is the image we are projecting in the netherlands at the moment , and a few years ago i agreed with you , but i no longer think it is the case . 
  i happen to do business with dutch people who visit romania regularly , and they share my opinion . 
  they would also benefit from romania joining schengen , so there is that ... oh well , it will take a while , but things will change . 
   with a brain like yours , i bet you 're not even dutch . 
  honestly , that is uncalled for . 
  ( s ) he is influenced by the public opinion in her/his country , just like us . 
   ... everything not related to labor movement . 
  do you mean merchandise ? 
  why do you find that threatening ? 
   do n't expect us to open our borders to someone we do n't trust ( yet ) . 
  you already did ? 
  it 's just transport of merchandise that is affected . 
  do you fear our products ? 
  those evil dacia cars will kill you in your sleep :d can you please explain why is it just the netherlands and finland that fear our merchandise ? 
  are these 2 countries the sole defenders of european values ? 
  we seem to have [ good trade between our countries ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rou ) , a schengen ascension should positively impact both our economies .
