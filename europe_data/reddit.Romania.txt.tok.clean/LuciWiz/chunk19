   see serbia and ie the minorities problems looks like a lived in a cave , because i was n't aware about these issues . 
  and i grew up in banat , 
   the name marea britanie is also wrong , but i 'm not going into that not if they actually mean great britain and not the united kingdom  but yes , calling it england is really ignorant . 
  true , but i assume they used the `` well-known '' name in the poll to avoid having to explain what they mean to the average joe . 
   itt : romanians complimenting everyone . 
  first time i hear about this . 
  i do n't thing this is a big concern in romania about this issue , if it exists . 
  how do you know so much about romania , did you major in romanian history or something ? 
   i keep learning new things about my country when reading your comments , 
   what country is olanda ? 
   the netherlands . 
   goddamnit they ask about belgium but not about the netherlands , what the shit `` olanda '' , 5th place , 
   is ireland included in '' marea britannie '' ?? 
  no , `` marea britanie '' means great britain , so not even northern ireland is included . 
  `` regatul unit '' means the united kingdom , and i am aware that does not include ireland either  i assume the average romanian does n't know all this , and they might lump ireland together with the rest . 
  portugal is no in the poll either , they are `` small spain ''  you can mend your ego with the fact you are probably third place , 
  bulgaria and serbia ? 
  the third one is stealth . 
  perfect defense . 
  wow !, 
   context ? 
  why was this clown playing in that game ? 
  is this action legal ? 
  i love the look on their faces , they really seem to consider themselves sooo smart ... stupid kids . 
  if i had to live in another country , it would probably be portugal . 
   someone should fine delivery companies in romania as well . 
  dhl charges 200 euros for a 4kg package to uk . 
  insane they also charge 66 euro for delivering a document ( 100 g ? ), 
  to portugal . 
  i have no stake in kosovo 's independence . 
  i am really sorry about what happened to kosovaars during the war , that was really fucked up . 
  i wish you the best of luck to making it as a country ; but please do not pretend the issues do not exist , you will not be able to fix problems if you pretend they do n't exist . 
  repeated tear gas in parliament is horrible , has nothing to do with a democracy , and this needs to stop and make way for the rule of law and civilized debate . 
  i wish i had some practical advice on how to make that happen , but sadly i am not some expert policy maker . 
  still , my advice is : please accept ( as a nation ? ), 
  that you have huge problems to overcome , and start working on them . 
  this will not be easy . 
  good luck !, 
   why are they failed states ? 
  because of some tear gas in parliament ? 
  you 're a bit dramatic are n't you . 
  i hope you are not serious ... 
  tear gas in parliament is afghanistan-level statesmanship . 
  this is not the first time either , the so-called `` state '' is beyond failed . 
   i 've never heard of this before , do you have a link to something explaining it in depth ? 
  he is referring to islam , not scientology , 
  yes we did . 
  in 1972  lots of equal scores though . 
  romania vs france is usually a snooze-fest , and it will be opening match . 
  oh , thanks . 
  probably a mistake . 
  i like to walk around a lot ( like many km ) when i visit a new place , and i walked over a bridge on a busy highway in california , first time i was there . 
  the side-walk all of the sudden got really narrow ( i do n't think it was a side-walk by that point ) , and cars were whizzing passed me at incredible speeds . 
  and there was no way to get away without actually passing the bridge . 
  closest i have been to death yet . 
  good to know i am not the only moron out there . 
   greek tourists on rental bikes were pulled off of the a10 highway . 
  please more details on this one ? 
  fair enough  may the best tiny country win !, 
  romania went through this stage as well , not sure we are completely out of it yet . 
  do n't worry , it is an easy enough fix , but you need to start building ** a lot ** more jails !, 
  the good news is they do n't have to be in good condition ( quite the contrary ) , so you can do it on the cheap . 
  buddy has a construction company looking to expand in se europe , let me know if you need to contract some work . 
  it 's saturday night and we all had a bit too much to drink  france will destroy romania ( sounds odd out of context ) . 
  last time switzerland beat us was in 1994 , 
  there was this homeless man when i was living in timisoara , who had 2 phd 's ( one of them was in philosophy ) . 
  he went a bit insane after his wife and child died in a car accident , and gave up on everything , started to live on the streets . 
  i would sometimes listen to him walking to the university , as he was talking to groups of other homeless people ( they gathered around him like jesus followers must have ) . 
  his most memorable speech was about how `` the others '' ( i felt like he vaguely pointed in my direction , but perhaps it was just my paranoia ) are sleeping and not living a real life . 
  i ca n't remember everything he said , but being young i was very impressed , i think i considered giving up my studies  the guy was really smart , to say the least . 
   i knew we would be in group with germans . 
  but no russians to help them this time , 
  i agree that the poll was ( intentionally ? ), 
  conducted using misleading language . 
  and they got an almost 50 % higher `` no '' response than the previous poll results , go figure ... 
   so that the rest of the eu member states do n't feel left out , european commission president jean-claude juncker will also take a seat at the negotiating table . 
  your country voted in favor of mandatory quotas , 
   remember the reaction of eastern europe when the eu wanted to resettle refugees from italy and greece ? 
  i would like to point out that there was a reaction against ** mandatory quotas ** , which were considered unsustainable in terms of integration capacity ( perhaps just a pretext ) , not against helping out per se . 
  also , even then , the majority of eastern countries voted ** for ** the package , not against it . 
  finally , this was a vote , not a veto , and there is an important distinction between the 2 . 
  the majority won , as in any democratic vote , and even the countries that voted against the measure will act according to the will of the majority . 
  i am btw not trying to defend the vote on refuges quotas from ( part of ) ee , just pointing out how this is not a `` tit for tat '' situation . 
  it is slightly amusing that the countries that voted against , ~ ~ with the exception of poland ~ ~ ( i just remembered even poland voted in favor of the quotas ) , are sufficiently far from russia to not be affected by lifting the embargo , in the short to medium term . 
  so i do not know whom italy are trying to punish . 
  edit : i remembered poland voted in favor of the quotas . 
   why do you need so many failing grades ? 
  we like to measure failure precisely , it is a favorite past time , 
   the issue is that most refugees aim for our cities while the manual labour is needed is in the rurual sector . 
  probably there are also a lot of people unwilling to do so . 
  if you used to be a car mechanic/own a company/whatever , it will be very hard for you mentally to take such a job . 
  i can understand that , to be honest . 
  at first glance it may seem conceited , but going down in ( even perceived ) status can be a tough thing to cope with , especially for ambitious individuals . 
  i wonder whether the proposal to move some of them to eastern europe would improve the matter . 
  there is more unqualified work to be performed , such as working in factories on the production line ( not as much robots as in germany ) . 
  but the locals do n't crowd to these jobs either , they can be gut-wrenchingly unchallenging ... 
  is there no unqualified work refugees could perform ( picking fruits , unqualified construction work etc. ) ? 
  or are they unwilling to engage in manual labor ? 
  thanks !, 
  i fully support the re-unification of hungary with transylvania ... under strong romanian leadership , of course  ( i stole this one from a british comedian , but i ca n't remember which ),
