  ca n't pin cop\u00e9 on us , he was born in france :p, 
  this is a rather good debate . 
  no matter your views on the issue , it is worth your time . 
  no scooters , 3/4 . 
  oh , i thought the swiss custom was to kiss 3 times on the cheek . 
  maybe they were fine with that ? 
  so glad i do n't own a tv . 
  good question , i am afraid i do n't have a good answer . 
  it seems like every generation will identify with the sort of music they are listening to at the moment and see that as representative . 
  my parents would mention some old french songs , as well as [ pasarea colibri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbyyps3bou0 ) , [ iris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mmgzbcf1g8 ) and [ phoenix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adro9oumolc ) . 
  i would do the same , and throw some newer rock in the pot , such as [ cargo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7n4wruuh68 ) . 
  but when it comes to timelessness , i believe enescu will be the go-to name , and the younger people will come around to it . 
  or so i hope . 
   ` old people music ' oh , so triggered  [ george enescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_enescu ) is the most famous romanian composer , but classical music is as popular with the youth as it is in most countries i suppose . 
  there is a thing called `` shadow boxing '' , we used to do it to music , and being able to ( sort of ) do it to `` ciocarlia '' was a great achievement . 
  today 's youth are not like in our time , what is the world turning to , grumble , grumble ... 
  i hear what you are saying , i just slapped one of these fuckers on the berlin bus from the airport . 
  i love french museums so much , and i have to avoid mentioning i am romanian so my day does n't get ruined by being given disgusted looks by fucking fruit salesmen ... 
  still , you should know the `` french '' people swarming in our country into the low-level `` universities '' we have going are hardly reminiscent of baudelaire . 
  they do n't beg or steal , but are annoying in other ways . 
  i hear what you are saying , though :(, 
  maybe we are just ladies men . 
  wholeheartedly agree , though i feel understanding the voiced message is important to fully appreciate this one . 
  like the immortal [ phoenix - in umbra marelui urss ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adro9oumolc ) , the message still gives me chills . 
  the romanian [ '' \u0103 '' ( schwa ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwa ) is actually different to the portuguese '' \u00e3 '' . 
  however , portuguese has the highest phonological similarity to romanian , though not being the closest from a lexical point of view - italian takes that honor . 
  an interesting tidbit , to my ear portuguese sounds very different when spoken by women ( very sexy ) than it does when spoken by men ( let 's just say , less pleasant :p ) . 
  glorious romania . 
  i keep spamming [ ciocarlia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pn1x1_a64 ) , but it deserves it . 
   french politician do n't need coherence . 
  this trait seems to be well correlated with populism/extremism in general , not only french . 
  i assume it 's because people prone to use a populist rhetoric were born without a spine . 
  they are your scottish , 
   ciolos for example speaks a very neat and fluent french . 
  he is married to one of you , he has little choice :p french accents are hard for us , when compared to italian for instance . 
  it is much easier to read than to talk or even to understand when spoken to . 
  people in lyon for instance talk too fast and with an odd intonation that makes it almost incomprehensible . 
  anyway , i will take it over german any day . 
  that course was a total waste of my money . 
  pretty bad accent , but i am not one to talk . 
  i think french is still mandatory at the faculty of journalism . 
  speakers of romanian generally find it easier to learn other romance languages than the other way around ( including spanish ) . 
  it seems to be due to the slavic influence in our language . 
  but if you learn romanian you should be set for life , we will rule this eu thing in 20 years or so , 
  desecrating the image of vlad should be illegal :(, 
  i believe she speaks french , but it may be at an unsatisfactory level for such an interview . 
  i mean the journalist , btw , 
  why would she join a conference in romania ? 
  does it not clash with her views ? 
  i bet her luggage was packed with disinfectant . 
   lgbt discrimination is illegal in romania , but so is same-sex marriage as far as i know same-sex marriage is not illegal per se , but `` unrecognized '' . 
  if a gay couple claimed they got married ( in the woods or something ? ), 
  they would n't be prosecuted for it . 
  but they would not be able to take advantage of their married status , so i guess it might as well be illegal . 
  do n't take this away from us . 
  that horse is now kebab :(, 
   not even remotely . 
  the uk is actually on 7th place . 
  but he is from the netherlands  that graph shows the dutch to be the 2nd contributors per capita after luxemburg , but this is data from 2007 . as far i know they are in first place now . 
  that looks like sorcery . 
  i still prefer his [ ciocarlia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pn1x1_a64 ) ( the lark - bird ) . 
  always makes me think of our country , for some reason . 
  very interesting , i was n't aware custom duties are taken into account . 
   the netherlands are the # 2 producer of agricultural goods in the world by worth , after the us that is very impressive for such a small country . 
  why do we know you just for tulips ? 
  is this achievement due to the extensive green house system you have going ? 
  does it matter that we are at least grateful ? 
  i think you are the biggest contributor per capita when you deduct funds coming in from funds put in the budget . 
  the question is why do you get so little money from the pot ? 
  infrastructure seems to be very good in the netherlands , so this is why cee is getting most of the money there . 
  but agriculture is mostly france and spain . 
  are you doing incredibly well there as well ? 
  perhaps you guys are trying to compete with sweden for the moral super power award . 
  and why is hungary getting the most funds per capita ? 
  they are being assholes , are n't they ? 
  none of this makes sense . 
  you are . 
  yes , vetoing canada is easy , nobody gives a shit . 
  if we did it to the us we would be in trouble , so we do it with canada and we hope it makes the us removes visas so the trade deal is not threatened . 
  unfortunately , the canadians seem to have an over-inflated sense of importance , they wo n't budge , so we need to actually wreck the deal :(, 
   by that analysis we can say that france played a fundamental role in the unification of romania . 
  well , that is true . 
  i recommend you start throwawa1889 . 
  maybe you will lose the racism on that one . 
   schengen membership is far more important to the everyday lives of romanians than a tourist visa to canada or the us . 
  for business though , they are equally important . 
  i mean the us one . 
  i do n't get the canada discussion . 
  it seems like a lovely country , but it simply does not matter for us . 
  this is actually a good point . 
  damn . 
   most notably `` disguising '' themselves as western companies , to bypass the stereotypes we do the same , 
  yes , but we do n't see it that way . 
  canada never comes up in conversation around here , while the us does all the time . 
  ok , maybe i exaggerated a bit there . 
   they are our 51st state , and honorary ` muricanstm you have a communist state !? 
  i guess that explains bernie sanders . 
  canada is not the us ... canada is n't even in this graph , i really do n't understand what you are talking about here ... edit : did romanians in this survey respond that they see canada as a main ally for national security ? 
  what am i missing here ? 
  i am not asking for protectionism , i am asking for fairness in trade .
