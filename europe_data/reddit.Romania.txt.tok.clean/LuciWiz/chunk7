  they do have a big issue with ** illegal ** immigration from mexico , but i have n't witnessed anyone , in california at least , being racist towards mexicans in general . 
  and when i say big , think a lot bigger than the recent refugee wave europe is screaming about . 
  now , i will not pretend that it absolutely does not matter that i am white , because i do n't know whether that is true or not . 
  but i can tell you , walking through silicon valley , you see more asian , indian and mexican people than you see caucasians . 
  and i have not noticed a sentiment of `` we need to do something about this '' , as is the case lately in ( a minority of the population of ) europe . 
  thanks . 
  i lived a couple of months every year in california for business purposes , it was great . 
  i just love my country , ca n't help it . 
  yes , it would be great to get some context on these polls , like which geographic area where they conducted in , what was the age of respondents and so on . 
  i assume hungary would n't be so low if this poll was conducted in transylvania , for instance . 
  yes , the us is lovely as a romanian . 
  if i ever decide to emigrate , it will be there . 
  americans in general do n't seem to give a shit about where you come from , as long as you work hard . 
   is `` marea britanie '' the uk ? 
  google says `` the sea britain '' . 
  that 's odd . 
  it says `` uk '' for me . 
  still incorrect , but less so  `` mare '' means both `` big '' ( great ) and `` sea '' . 
  i guess because the sea is big or something . 
  i think there will be some backslash after the polish thread , though  i hope you guys are well armed . 
  an invasion would go through hungary , so that 's 2 birds , 
  it is funny that i have you tagged as `` optimist ''  i ca n't remember why , but it fits . 
  i assume he was joking , like `` you think we are all gypsies , anyway '' . 
  what , all 10 million of them ? 
  dude , you can do whatever you like , as long as you stand on only one leg while doing it . 
  trust me , i study law . 
  thank you for the information . 
  i also got the impression that we are not really a cheap country , and i travel a lot in europe and the us . 
  i mean , sure , when compared to zurich - but otherwise it seems our cities are pretty expensive . 
  except for the rent . 
  hotel accommodation is also pretty high . 
  i can stay for the same price or lower in better conditions in berlin , for instance . 
  i ca n't compare to poland , as i was only in the airport on a layover . 
   i found romania a bit expensive when visiting not by much , but actually expected to pay less . 
  interesting . 
  can you share where did you go , and in which areas were the prices most out of expectations ? 
  ( accommodation , food , transport ? ), 
  thanks !, 
  that is strange . 
  i thought hungary was doing better than that . 
  i get that , but i kind of doubt the ukraine is in a position to really mess it up for the rest of the eu . 
  it is more likely we will pull them up rather then them pulling us down . 
  romania was also let to slide into the eu although there were iffy chapters , in the idea we would fix them along the way ( even if we need to be forced into it ) . 
  being in the eu has benefited us enormously , and i think it also benefits a little the netherlands already , and the common benefits it will even increase . 
  when we were n't worthy of the eu ( you might think it is still the case ) we were also led by awful politicians , and the situation is improving . 
  the population , or i as a person , did n't bare any fault for this state of things , and making required changes in the political class required many years to happen . 
  ukraine needs our help . 
  now , not 25 years in the future . 
  they are not turkey , who is ambivalent on the whole ascension deal , and is doing reasonably well as it is . 
  i say let 's do our best to lend them a helping hand , and reward the hardship they put themselves through as a result of trying to cozy up to us . 
  it seems only fair . 
  nah  some of the dutch voted against the deal because ( their politicians say ) this way they can impose better regulation in regards to animal rights . 
  sort of a carrot and stick approach . 
  think something like romania and bulgaria not being allowed in schengen until they improve their fight against corruption , but with different stakes . 
  i do n't know if there is much to explain . 
  dutch people care a lot about animal rights ( and i respect them for it ) . 
  they can afford to think about and consider things like these , because they are not starving or fighting a covert war against a force many times stronger . 
  ukrainians are probably concerned about getting some more human rights in the near future . 
  baby steps . 
  tells you how much people from the west understand about real problems . 
  they do n't know what it feels like to eat an orange for the first time after seeing them in movies for years , on your neighbor 's vcr , in secret . 
   the current people leading your country ruined it . 
  hold them responsible ... and talk to us in about 25 years , when you sort it all out ? 
  haha , you do understand ukrainians are dreaming about becoming like greece , right ? 
  have you experienced excruciating hunger , and people shooting weapons outside , as your mom hides you in the bathtub ? 
  greece is the poster boy for misery now , wow . 
  it 's what every ukrainian has been dreaming of , 
  oh , the daughter of petre roman ? 
  i am surprised she has such weight problems , her dad used to be voted by many women based on his looks . 
  also , i am glad i do n't watch tv ... 
   ** hold ** habits die hard . 
  is this a jab at the french habit of not pronouncing the `` h '' ? 
  if so , it is brilliant , 
   their symbian os was a pile of crap that needed to be revamped , but they could n't be bothered . 
  their development toolbox sucked even more . 
  it was so painful to even deploy an app . 
   our politicians constantly suck the dick of the orthodox church that is proof prostitution is in fact legal , surely ? 
  more clay for the motherland . 
  i do n't know who she is , but i am having second thoughts . 
  it 's all a big misunderstanding . 
  europeans do n't get how russians take holidays . 
  i am ready and up for the task . 
  look like not even the russians want us . 
  just like the refugees . 
  that is a possibility , for sure . 
  i would have assumed the romanian corrupt class ( living here and following the news , you know our information services are in close relations with the dna ) would know better than to try it , but i do tend to overestimate people 's abilities . 
  it is not mossad per se , but ex-mossad agents who started an agency for these sort of intimidation operations . 
  the best guess is they were hired by some high-profile person investigated by the dna , * maybe * the israeli billionaire [ investigated in a corruption case in romania ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/sixth-richest-israeli-investigated-in-royal-restitution-case-in-romania/161520/ ) ( in absence ) . 
   apparently turkish smugglers have already been buying up hostels along the black sea coast to sail people to bulgaria instead interesting . 
  will they then go through serbia and then try their luck with the orban fence , or take an alternate route ? 
  i know romania deports them right back , and they claim we are `` bad people '' , 
   tovarish , i just know what the future will bring . 
  russian women ? 
  you get we were changing flair just for april fool 's , right ? 
  or did we blow your cover , comrade ? 
   they tracked down a woman in panama who supposedly was ` director ' of 10000 companies at the same time and over 20000 in total . 
  now i feel like a failure ... i thought i was working hard . 
  sorry to hear that . 
   no , no , no , no . 
   you are asking me nonsense .
