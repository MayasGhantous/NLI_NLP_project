  wow , this guy is an awful liar . 
  at least our corrupt politicians handle themselves better under pressure . 
  they still go to jail , though, 
  haha , that is not suspicious at all , no sir , 
   but it seems he got his nickname/surname from being inducted into the order of the dragon not the order of the devil it seams the correct translation is the original one , current romanian language meaning shift notwithstanding . 
  you are right on that . 
  still , a very small percentage of present-day romanians are aware of the etymology of the word , so that does n't make it less spooky . 
   btw how is dragon in romanian now if dracul lost it 's meaning . 
  there is a recent tendency to actually use `` dragon '' , but read as it is spelled , not the english way : [ like this ] ( https://translate.google.com/#ro/en/dragon ) but the traditional romanian word is actually [ balaur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balaur ) . 
  boy , this reminds me of my childhood and reading over and over all those [ ispirescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petre_ispirescu ) stories . 
  such good memories ... 
   literally in the first line of your link it says in means dragon yes , you spotted that , did you ? 
   the word `` drac '' comes from the latin `` draco '' , which means dragon . 
  it had a double meaning back then , and it is the reason it got translated like that , but it no longer carries the old meaning . 
  it now literally means `` devil '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://istoriiregasite.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/de-unde-vine-porecla-de-dracula-sau-dracu1ea/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.rasfoiesc.com/educatie/istorie/dracula-negru-voda-vlad-tepes-73.php ) are good explanations on the etymology . 
  the wiki is right on the original translation , but the present day connotation is the one i mentioned . 
  no wonder nobody uses the surname any more , 
  yes , and a bit ominous . 
   it means refrigerator . 
  that is a cool name . 
  it means the devil . 
   it 's lithuanian version of polish surname - mickiewicz the lithuanian version sounds a lot cooler ( no offense ) . 
  i say you let them have him . 
  they unbanned me !!!, 
  sweet , sweet freedom . 
  i think i will visit their sub more often now , 
  i said their reaction made me laugh . 
  the funny thing is , i have n't . 
  only from / r/russia . 
  such is life . 
  does it ? 
  we make fun of everybody ( including us ) , not just russians . 
  the fact they react in the manner they do makes it funnier . 
  sort of like north korea , but with internet , so we can read their reactions . 
  i just posted my first comment there , and they banned me in less than 30 seconds :d, 
  ma lasi ? 
  * stop getting your facts in the way of my joke . 
  ... in africa !, 
  he seems to show a tiny bit of a devil 's horn in that picture . 
  there is so much disagree on the french side because they think their people ** are ** in fact perfect ( and their culture is superior to others ) . 
  i kid , i kid , 
  interesting . 
  in post-revolution romania , the mirror-events took place . 
  previous communists secured power as part of the new left , and they beat down student protests by using [ miners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltcamwpggnk ) ( class warfare was a favorite communist tactic perfected by the bolsheviks ) . 
  strangely enough , the right did not win any sort of asymmetrical hold on power as a result . 
  i would say the forces are quite balanced , with the left still being stronger due to the being united behind one party , unlike the fragmented parties on the right . 
  why would they do something like that ? 
  was it ordered by higher ups , or was the police acting by their own accord ? 
  and were the `` suits '' from the start iranian delegates ? 
  chilling to think about it in this manner , but the me people everyone complains about seem to just be stuck in a society similar to the european one only a few decades ago . 
   i guess you were quite scared for a moment . 
   like , this is all we have , 
  before you slaughtered the amerindians , 
   tolyatti city ah , i thought you were hungarian . 
  that makes sense . 
  oh , i was n't aware . 
  where is it located ? 
  oh , reddit posts are not sufficient to convey my anger , 
  too proud to buy our logans ? 
  and which country is latin ? 
  60 % of romania , that 's who !, 
  but erdogan 's reaction makes it priceless . 
  i feel like the footage is already very damming , even without the lyrics . 
  i do n't watch tv , and reading the news did n't really convey to me the seriousness of the situation in turkey ... that policeman randomly hitting the guy with the baton - holy shit . 
  i got no choice :p, 
  i will try harder next time . 
   i 'm not laughing i hope you are aware that is a choice you are making , and has little to do with me . 
  oh , i thought you were american for some reason . 
  ok , not british either . 
  are we good now ? 
  ( p.s : jokes are jokes , mate ), 
   muslims in foreign countries !, 
  like france ? 
  probably not americans or romanians , though . 
  so we are good , 
   vote hillary clinton , or donald trump will kill all muslims !, 
  but who will hillary kill ? 
   muslim detected . 
  get him guys . 
   in romania , hungarian police is quite known for taking bribes . 
  i think that changed in the last years . 
  or do i look more scary now because i wear a suit ? 
  everywhere is unsafe , he needs americans to elect him for president so that he makes the world safe again . 
  vote donald trump , or muslims will eat your babies !, 
  ( they are delicious ), 
  they used to pull the same stunt at the romanian-hungarian border 10 years ago . 
  basically they did this mostly with buses rather than with small vehicles . 
  it was also enabled by the bus drivers/guides who wanted to pass the border `` without problems '' , and did n't want to hold the entire bus for the odd person out who did n't have the requisite 500 euros to show to the guards as proof that they are not beggars ( or something ) . 
  this thing stopped when the anti-corruption thing started , and it was important for border guards to be `` clean '' ( there were also arrests ) . 
  once it stopped on the romanian side , it also stopped on the hungarian side , because they needed an agreement to do this sort of stuff . 
   but despite the police being called , her lack of english meant she was not able to lodge a formal complaint , and her husband was released from custody . 
  i feel like the articles lately are just trolling us . 
  in a city with a large arabic population , they could n't find anyone to help her write the complaint ? 
  come on , stop this shit . 
   `` nothing like this has happened at the western wall for years . '', 
   she said she would consider leaving the squalid idomeni camp -- where people are sheltering even on railway tracks -- if the greek government decides to give every migrant family `` a simple house '' . 
  come on , she must be joking . 
   is this the same chemtrails minister ? 
  wait , is this conspiracy theory famous ?
