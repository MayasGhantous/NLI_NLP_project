russia and france agree to coordinate again ? 
  apologize for what ? 
  putting their airspace in front of russia 's plane ? 
  what happened at the end of the war ? 
  the unification of romania happened due to romanians , both at governmental level and in the field . 
  from wikipedia :  24 aprilie s.n. 
  \\  helped romania a lot \\  [ mfw ] ( http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/11117962625_92c0ea3512_o.jpg ), 
   why would they intervene in romania ? 
  just so mean people like me ca n't say they never did anything ? 
   you mean they should have started a war every time or what ? 
  just once would 've been nice . 
  the opportunity to intervene into a former soviet satellite state ( ceausescu strong ok i know ) was handed to the west on a silver platter and they did n't take it . 
  keep in mind this was before the ussr collapsed . 
  i mean , i myself think that russia ruining europe to a degree that not even the ottoman empire , the mongol empire and the plague combined could 've even dreamed of is enough . 
  but you 're free to do as you please . 
  yes ... ? 
  that was my point . 
  this is very important since it was a turkish convoy apparently . 
  * western support during ww1 . 
  * western support for white russians during the russian civil war . 
  * western support for communists as soon as the tides turned . 
  * no western reaction to the first soviet republic in europe ( hungary ) . 
  * no western reaction to virtually all russian acts of war in europe before operation barbarossa . 
  * western support during ww2 . 
  included sacrilegious amounts of resources poured into russia for free and the biggest mobilization of american troops on foreign soil solely for the purpose of attacking russia 's main aggressor . 
  * western support after the war . 
  the west allowed russia to keep everything it wanted . 
  did n't even ask them to leave berlin . 
  * no western reaction to the countless massacres , rapes , exiles , tortures , regime changes and even a case of * complete genocide * in konigsberg . 
  * no western reaction to the annexation of parts of finland , ukraine and romania as well as the attempted dissolution of the baltic states . 
  * no western reaction to the hungarian revolution in 1956 . 
  * no western reaction to the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . 
  * no western reaction to the romanian revolution in 1989 . 
  * no western reaction to the fall of the ussr . 
  * no western reaction to the transnistrian war and the creation of transnistria out of annexed ukrainian/moldavian territory . 
  * no western reaction to russia trying to attack the baltic states shortly after the fall of the ussr . 
  * no western reaction to the current war in ukraine . 
  * no western reaction to cuba . 
  also : * all communist leaders from south america , except grenada , were removed by their respective countries ' forces . 
  * korea and vietnam were completely phoned-in and done purely to comfort japan . 
  i guess if you want to cite south korea 's existence as an example of westerns successfully engaging communists then ... ok ? 
  * no western reaction to cambodia . 
  * no western reaction to indonesia . 
  * the middle eastern interventions were done to comfort israel . 
  i guess when you 've done literally nothing for decades , some training and supplies go a long way as far as public perception . 
  apart from romania and hungary , no eastern european country sided with them . 
  and most of them were treated even worse after the war . 
  so do i. 
  almost a century of western-russian collaboration is more than enough . 
   its real reason for shooting down a russian plane it entered its airspace ? 
  are n't these things kind of antiquated now that nobody actually declares war anymore ? 
  presumably , russia did not deploy a missile cruiser near turkey in order to deescalate things . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u3n17/russia_to_stop_air_communication_with_turkey/ ) is also basically goading turkey into legitimately shooting more planes down . 
  your original point was that turkey 's military is not , in fact , more powerful than france 's and germany 's combined . 
  i think i 've disproved that ... 
  i know it 's almost impossible for the french to even conceive a world that does not have unwavering russophilia as it 's foundation but yes , it does exist . 
  and dropping nuclear ordinance on it would be a very bad idea . 
  attacking turkey or any other muslim country with nuclear weapons is a death sentence . 
  just the muslims * in russia * would go mad . 
  plus you would have literally * hundreds of millions of military age males * from all over north africa , the caucasus , the middle east and the stans pouring into russia looking to kill every man , woman , child , dog , cat , insect , plant on sight with their bare hands if they have to . 
  any reason why the bosporus ca n't be closed to russian vessels ? 
  even if shooting down that plane was n't 100 % legal , which it was , this is pretty significant escalation . 
  starting from 1900 or 1914 makes russia look even worse . 
   active personnel : more than germany 's and france 's combined . 
   tanks : more than germany 's and france 's combined . 
   aircraft : on par with both germany and france . 
   nuclear warheads : largely irrelevant . 
   aircraft carriers : largely irrelevant . 
  but ok , france has a whole aircraft carrier . 
   submarines : literally as many as germany and france combined . 
   budget : is this your point ? 
  do you have any sources on what these budgets are being used for ? 
  i 'd wager germany and france are blowing their money on `` next generation '' planes and tanks while turkey is sticking with buying f16s and whatnot . 
  and again , turks will actually use their military . 
  well they are in nato so it 's the thing to do . 
  are people seriously doubting turkey 's military and their willingness to use it ? 
  this is hilarious . 
  what do you mean ? 
  whataboutism ... about what ? 
  is this some kind of westerner delusion ? 
  that everyone from poland to turkey to russia `` needs '' the eu or the us ? 
  [ those are not turks though . 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/official-pepe/images/9/9f/pepe_pls.png/revision/latest?cb=20150819001133 ), 
  what makes you think turkey needs nato ? 
  their military is bigger than germany 's and france 's combined , their armor consists of more than just cast iron tractors with guns bolted onto them by slaves , and turks are very nationalistic and proud and will not shy from combat or abide by any stupid rules of engagement . 
  plus turkish military staff is not infested by russophiles and communists . 
  really , if anything , a nato intervention might be detrimental . 
  turkey 's acts of war in europe after ww1 : * cyprus . 
  russia 's acts of war in europe after ww2 : * countless people raped , executed , tortured , imprisoned and exiled . 
  * complete genocide in konigsberg , a historically non-russian region . 
  * annexation of historically non-russian parts of finland , ukraine and romania as well as the de facto dissolution of several non-russian states . 
  * attacking hungary in 1956 . 
  * invading czechoslovakia in 1968 . 
  * several assassination attempts on tito . 
  * attacking the baltic states as the ussr disintegrated . 
  * attacking moldova/romania in 1990 and annexing parts of moldova/ukraine in 1992 . 
  * attacking ukraine in 2013-2014 , still ongoing . 
  edit : oh yeah , keep in mind , this is almost 100 years compared to just 70 and russia was just as belligerent from 1918 to 1941 * and * i was nice and did n't mention any of the caucasus atrocities . 
  amazing amount of russian belligerence in just 24 hours . 
  turkey should close the bosporus and establish a blockade around latakia .
