but hungarians , huns , magyars or any other people related or connected with current day hungary demographics/ethicity were not there in those times , so such a conclusion could not be implied in the same way . 
  the migrant quotas as voted in 2020 : germany : 8 million france : 7 million ... spain : 5 million poland : 4 million ... romania : 3 million ... malta : 200 thousands and then , of course , there are some countries with opt-out rights . 
  those will use voluntary quotas , if any . 
  i bet that 's not the real reason . 
  romania 's president klaus iohannis , of german ethnicity , obviously fluently speaks german and i suppose he must speak english too , but how did this help romania ? 
  our `` quota '' has increased more than three-fold ( 1785 to 6800 ish ) , more than for other countries ( the new quotas are not in the same proportions as the old ones - for some countries the quota increase was a lot smaller ) . 
  the big countries were not open to any kind of negotiation , they just want to save their arses ( and as we say - remove the chestnuts from the fire using someone else 's hand  ) . 
  indeed , right now we in romania are installing huge signs on the borders with hungary and serbia : west is in the opposite direction !, 
  and if joking '' \u00e0 la '' timesnewroman.ro ( or , why not , madonion ) : hungary is trying to prevent entry of migrants in their country installing huge signs `` welcome to romania '' . 
  i work for a romanian company in sales/distribution with a few foreign business partners , most of them german . 
  we also have a usa based parner and this one is the only one having a `` code of ethics '' and also requiring its distributors abroad to take a short training in fcpa regulations and sign a `` due dilligence '' declaration by which the distributor agrees to accept fcpa and avoid with all costs breaking the anti-corruption and embargo laws . 
  i know this is also to protect the us company in case of a lawsuit . 
  but i wonder why do n't do german companies the same ? 
  ethics is not/no longer important for them , or they do n't care what their distributors do abroad ? 
  during the last 15 years or so i noticed a gradually increasing `` lack of corectness '' ( ca n't find a better wording for this ) in our german partners . 
  small issues or bigger ones , maybe a wrong price , maybe a wrong delivery , maybe they get a module out of a configuration but keep the price the same ... they kept apearing more and more often . 
  it 's been like the more we get unbalkanized ( in a way ) the more they get balkanized in our place . 
  it 's like the communicating vessels principle . 
  heck , one of our newer suppliers of `` made in germany '' products has the factory in turkey . 
  i supoose in any kind of statal or interstatal union , if forming an ideally stable system , after enough time the differences become minimal . 
  populations , mentalities , customes and values - all mix and diffuse like gases sonner or later . 
  so i think the explanation for the vwgate is simple . 
  germany has been getting used with lying , with corruption and so on . 
  and who were the usual culprits for this kind of stuff ? 
  the balkans . 
  so maybe they 've learnt it from us . 
  siemens was mentioned earlier on this thread . 
  i could bet siemens will be involved in a scandal involving its medical division ( i do n't work with them but i have a feeling in this ; they build and equip hospitals , a lot of money involved ) . 
  i know they had some huge scandals already in the energy field - including in africa . 
  maybe that 's what most other contries are for them - just some other africas . 
  i might sound germanophobe and i 'm absolutelly not . 
  but i really am dissapointed because germany/germans were a model for corectness ( not necessary fairness too ) - this is how they were percieved here in romania and this is increasingly far from truth . 
  i visited germany multille times and liked it . 
  i was even considering for my son to attend a german university since the brits hate us so much ( well it 's still early to decide ) - so i do n't hav esome issue with the german people but somehow i feel they are not the way they used to be like 20 years ago in respect to moral values . 
  i even know a german who told me that corruption in germany does exist , but no german would risk something for less than 1 million euros . 
  so cheating an emission test is just another step on their road as i see it .

  sorry for any typos . 
  i do n't think this is a real story . 
  a lot of unplausible elements . 
  maybe i 'm generalizing but imho his english , even being from hong kong , is too good ( i knew an engineer from hk during a technical training abroad and his english was terrible ) . 
  also , riding the bike trough europe since 2014 , eating nuts ... yeah right, 
  thank you . 
  it would be hard for me to think xenophobia might appear , it 's just a joke , 
  bien/alright  but i 've just received a request from mod ivashkin ( for my initial submission , which was to the google translate page directly ) : `` hi , do you mind resubmitting this as a direct link and adding a link to google translate in the comments please ? '', 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m1erp/satire_first_extraterrestrial_signal_received_by/cvb6emv so i had just deleted the original post , and submited this one . 
  now it gets deleted for low quality  i thought humor is a matter of taste and that among all this tension on the subject a little humor wo n't hurt . 
  edit : also , please note that while you 've wrote to me , i was preparing the translation in the comment . 
  maybe i should have added the [ satire ] tag in the title , to prevent any confusion ? 
  but come on , who could n't see it 's satire ? 
  [ satire ] obviously translation : https://translate.google.ro/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.timesnewroman.ro%2fit-stiinta%2fprimul-semnal-receptionat-de-la-o-civilizatie-extraterestra-nu-primim-refugiati&amp;edit-text= adjusted translation ( hopefully better ) : historic moment for planet earth . 
  seti institute in usa received the first message from space , from an alien civilization . 
  the message is very simple : `` we do not accept refugees ! '', 
  written in capitals , in all languages of the earth . 
  the message continues , detailing punishments earthlings would receive if syrian refugees would be sent into space . 
  the aliens have already begun to raise an intergalactic fence that separates the milky way galaxy and started using their space ships to patrol all transit systems . 
  `` we can not speak of a free galaxy anymore !, 
  it 's awful . 
  the aliens want to impose quotas for refugees , otherwise they are going to send a comet towards us '' says jeremy r , nasa employee . 
  aliens have warned mankind that besides arabs , afghans or pakistanis they wo n't accept any romanian or bulgarian , but did not say specifically why , arguing only that it was a `` political decision '' and that any clarification for the situation of these inferior category of earthlings would be made within a still undefined time schedule . 
  sure , no problem . 
  edit : i did that , but i was informed but it 's going to get delinted as `` low quality content '' . 
  too bad , i thought a little humor wo n't hurt . 
   the uk , ireland and denmark can opt out if they want . 
  wait , i thought we were a `` union '' ? 
  that does n't seem very equitable , but rather convenient for some . 
  and why not per gdp or per land area , or per a combined formula of gdp/land area/population ? 
  well it appears of lot of germans do , anyway , including merkel . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/merkel-refuses-to-apologize-for-welcoming-refugees-a-1053253.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-munichs-citizens-welcome-refugees-with-open-arms-10490455.html and so on ... 
  i think the difference between middle east migrants and your hypothetical example of north american migrants lies in their `` profile '' . 
  i would trust 99 % of the americans/canadians wo n't even think of committing terrorist attacks or taking part in a jihad . 
  i do know usa had some terrorist attacks too but they were not really backed buy an ideology . 
  they were ( i think ) usually the lone wolf type - involving a mentally unstable / deranged person . 
  when i think of middle east refugees i just can not avoid thinking of the beheadings or of that they come from an area inherently so violent . 
  in central/eastern europe , unlike usa , most people do n't have guns ( and are not allowed to , i think , without good reason ) , while in the middle east war zones everybody seems to have weapons and be really very used to violence . 
  brilliant !, 
  so everything might work out , eventually , for everyone . 
  germany wants them , they want in germany . 
  some other countries do n't want / cant support them , they do n't want there either . 
  it 's just the stupid eu bureaucracy that does n't understand that . 
  i want to help you but i 'm gon na force on you the way i want to help . 
  they found a solution for the gypsies from ro/bg , right ? 
  pay them 200-300 $ and book a flight to the destination . 
  the article appears not paywalled for me - i was able to read the whole text ( from europe ) . 
  maybe is geo-ip-blocked ( like it happens in europe for american music videos on youtube ) . 
  well that would be `` fair '' , but i saw a `` voting map '' on the ( usually best ) romanian news tv channel , showing every country 's vote , and the whole eu except 5 countries were blue ( meaning `` yes '' ) . 
  maybe they got it wrong . 
  edit : indeed they might have got it wrong , according to [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-eu-to-vote-through-quota-plan-despite-opposition-from-eastern-europe-10492190.html ) ireland has voted indeed , but that 's because they waived their opt-out . 
  so that implies the other countries who have the opt-out right did n't vote . 
  i do n't get this . 
  if uk , denmark and ireland have opt-outs from the `` area of freedom , security and justice '' and as a consequence are not required ( or forced ) to accept quotas , then why do they vote for establishing those quotas ? 
  i find this really puzzling and why not , unfair . 
  they do n't take compulsory quotas , then they should n't vote on this topic !, 
  in the end , what voting sistem has been used ? 
  nice or lisbon ? 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union#treaty_of_lisbon ) `` any member state can request that the nice rules are used for a particular vote '' but then again , the table lower on the same page appears to require unanimity in most of the areas using the nice system . 
  also according the same page `` lisbon rules eradicated the use of `` artificial '' voting weights '' but the table mentiones qmv for lisbon . 
  i wonder if wikipedia 's article is wrong ... 
  it appears that under lisbon rules a vote ca n't pass if at least 4 countries vote `` no '' and either 55 % of the contries or 65 % of represented population do n't vote `` yes '' . 
  lol yeah , but i was referring to the op , even though it was replying to nag3lt .
