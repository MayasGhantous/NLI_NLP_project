  out of 4 spanish articles i found on this topic , 3 were referring to `` possibly '' foreign customers with possibly `` east european '' accent . 
  apparently [ this ] ( http://www.infobierzo.com/una-familia-contrata-en-un-restaurante-de-bembibre-un-banquete-para-mas-de-100-personas-y-se-marchan-sin-pagar/292699/ ) is the initial article . 
  on the same website there is a newer article describing similar incidents that happened earlier in february . 
  so it 's an organised band of non-paying restaurant diners . 
  this seems funny and a little odd , police not being able to get them . 
  it seems there might be more to it than it was wrote and said . 
  it was n't criticism , just a question about your browser spellchecker . 
  as for your statement , it does n't really make much sense to me . 
  i guess you were referring to bulgaria and whether their citizens or rulers agree with `` what the majority wants '' , but still this does n't make any sense and seems unrelated to the op article . 
  maybe you were replying to a post above , but since you do n't quote , beats me ... bulgaria does not have any optouts ( so what optout should they be happy with ? 
  ) , bulgaria is already an eu member ( so what 's to join here ? ) ... 
  you lost me . 
  what should they agree on/participate , what majority you mean they are happy or not with , ... as i said , i do n't understand what you mean . 
  the time for optouts has passed . 
  they are no longer allowed for newer members . 
  does n't your browser spellchecker hurt because of all those punctuation marks not followed by spaces ? 
  i mean `` well , then '' and `` wants.if '' are not really proper words , are they ? 
  europe is already in two-tier mode : eu and non-eu . 
  i guess ms zlateva meant she was against a two-tier mode planned for eu . 
  but even if talking about eu , i do n't understand why the talk is about/against `` the creation of the so-called core [ ... ] and the rest '' like this would be a thing of the future , when in fact it 's a very present-day matter : the tiers and divisions have been already here , from the beginning or joining . 
  we have the schengen vs non-schengen split ( which should in theory come to an end but actually the non-schengen countries are at the mercy of the schengen ones in this respect , being postponed with or without valid arguments ) , then we have countries with opt-outs and countries without ( this division is apparently not going to disappear , because this is just the way it is ) , then there are further and maybe more important differences that divide eu countries : wealthy vs. poor , former communist vs the others , former colonial empires vs the others and so on . 
  in theory , given enough time , some of them might diminish or even disappear , but it 's not likely this will happen very soon . 
  of course , i understand what ms zlateva means , we do n't want additional divisions , but let 's just not pretend currently all the eu countries are equal in status and rights . 
  no problem , you 're right about the spam situation . 
  that must mean `` the kingdom of oysters '' ( or it 's just a false cognate ), 
  not to be pedantic , but i was posting a link to a news article , the previous post was just a link to a picture edit : or maybe you thought it was just the picture ? 
  wait , is n't this one the original one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe8wzynrpnu, 
  i do n't pretend i 'm smarter than the people in dutch universities , and i 'm not a linguist , but this map seems to be full of mistakes . 
  bulgarian and hungarian pujka/pulyka are wrongly labeled as having onomatopoeic origin . 
  in fact they are derived from the latin pulleus / pullus , similar to `` puica '' in romanian ( meaning female chick/hen ) . 
  this map mixes feminine and masculine version of the word . 
  at least for romanian , where `` curcan '' is the name of the male turkey , while `` curca '' is the feminine version . 
  according to romanian etymological sources , `` curcan '' is actually derived from `` curca '' , which is a loan from bulgarian `` kurka '' ( which might be out of use currently ) , which in turn is a loan from proto-turkic k\u00f6rt\u00fck , the same as the baschkir word [ \u043a\u04af\u0440\u043a\u04d9 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%ba%d2%af%d1%80%d0%ba%d3%99 ) . 
  i think it 's very likely that all the balkan/central-european words for turkey starting with `` c '' ( curca , kurka , curan , maybe even krokan ) could be derived from the same proto-turkic k\u00f6rt\u00fck . 
  as for the onomatopoeic sound , i am not sure what language do the turkeys speak in other countries but at leas where i am from , they do n't `` say '' truthuhn , but `` glu-glu-glu '' . 
  and by the way , if `` hahn '' means cock ( male of hen ) and trut-huhn ends in `` huhn '' - is n't there a connection ? 
  3 , 2 , 1 , bragging galore !, 
  just kiddin ' , but i hope reddit wo n't turn into facebook ii, 
   private even the hospitals [ edit : public hospitals ] `` externalize '' the clinical laboratory services , to specialized private medical practices or laboratories , that rent a space within the hospital premises . 
  this is the peak of corruption or incompetence . 
  the hospital is unable to manage a clinical lab , so they outsource the lab investigations to a private company . 
  they are either blatantly incompetent and ca n't keep working with profit , or are corrupt ( and the private lab company is most probably appointed despite conflict of interest ) or both . 
  i know pisa is secondary school level ( age 15 ) test , while the imo ( see below ) is high-school level ( under 20 ) and the participation scope is different , but still , it 's interesting how different are the results when comparing the two : https://www.imo-official.org/results_country.aspx?column=awards&amp;order=desc of course , pisa is for the average/all students , while only the best in each country attend the imos . 
  i see sweden , finland , estonia have very good math performance in pisa , but are ranked much lower in the imos and i 'm really wondering why . 
  at first i thought they are not interested in the imo 's and do not attend , but i was wrong : in 2016 sweden got 3 silver and 2 honorable mentions , estonia 1 bronze and 3 hm and finland only 3 hm . 
  meanwhile , in 2016 romania got 5 silver and 1 bronze . 
  to be honest , our education system ( in romania ) is really bad right now , ** overall ** , due to low funding and very low teacher wages . 
  but there might be an additional explanation to this bad performance in pisa : pisa is organised by oecd and some non-oecd contries ( including some in ue ) were rather late to the party and not really used to this kind of tests ( and , i heard , not really fully interested or involved ) . 
  pisa , timss , pirls and other forms of national testing were quite popular in some contries quite earlier , before being introduced in others . 
  i 'm not trying to find excuses ( i already said i 'm dissapointed by the current education system in romania ) but i 'm just noticing a fact . 
  the truth is that we have huge differences , with some very good students ( most of them in urban areas ) and , on the extreme , students in some rural areas with low acces to education . 
  the villages become un-populated , they are mixing ages in order to keep a school going ( e.g. 
  they make a single class for kids 6-7-8 years old and one for 9-10-11 y.o. , because there are not enough people - and kids - in those villages ) , schools are closed and kids must use a school bus or even walk 10 km to the next village ... and so on . 
  in rural areas there is also school abandonment ( even if education is compulsory by law ) . 
  ther 's no easy solution to this . 
  you ca n't force adults to remain in the villages if they get jobs in the cities and whole families leave , but you ca n't `` close '' the villages eihere , because there are still people there - so how can you keep a school with only 10 students ? . 
  you ca n't stop people going for work abroad ( unless you offer jobs here ) and that leaves some villages with a number of unattended kids ( or attended only by grandparents ) who only see their parents once in a year , some of them being forced to abandon school in order to work/care for their younger brothers . 
  while not at a very large scale , these issues exists are are extremely harmful . 
  these inequalities between urban/rural and between high-income and low-income families contribute a lot to the low pisa average score . 
  it 'd be interesting to se a breakout in rural/urban scores . 
  i upvote you for noticing how bad our education has fallen . 
  i 've been complaining about this for quite a few years but nobody seems to care . 
  happy birthday lithuania !, 
  romania has also celebrated 98 years from the `` great union day '' ( on december 1st 1918 ) which is practically our ( re ) birth day , marking the ( re ) unification of transylvania , bessarabia and bukovina with the romanian kingdom ( at that moment including wallachia and moldova ) . 
  the previous union was under michael the brave around 1600 but it did n't last long . 
  just wait , we 'll be right there in no time ; in fact , we 've already started . 
  being located between 3 empires ( habsburg , ottoman and tsarist ) and enduring half a century of communism is nothing we ca n't handle . 
   makes me wonder ... now i 'm genuinely wondering what you 're wondering . 
  ( i 'm guessing here - you suspect a ) a conspiracy involving your government in order not to broadcast this in czech media ... or b ) you wonder if the romanian protests really happen ? ), 
  all right , fair enough . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  what is your view on the double standards that might be applied when assessing what 's local news and on allowing question posts ? 
  some `` local news '' are allowed ( probably when deemed ^ by ^ whom ? 
  `` important enough '' ) , while some of similar scope are removed . 
  sometimes a question is allowed , while others are exiled to askeurope . 
  moderators are only human , so they might be prone to subjective judgement , but what 's allowed or not should n't be decided by personal preference . 
  there are ( or were , i 'm not sure ) mods that are ( or were ) constantly removing news ( news originating usually not from france , uk , or germany ) labelling them `` local news '' , even if they were no more local than others . 
  then there is the seldom question allowed once in a while , even if the rules say `` please use / r/askeurope for simple questions '' . 
  who decides what 's simple and how objective is that ? 
  thank you . 
  we have the best winds in europe . 
  it 's true . 
   it 's its , government 's pro-corruption decisions, 
  well , yeah , the heading did n't mention the absolute ( or absolute rubbish ) amount : $ 523.6 so hooray !, 
  oh , they even have a putin propaganda website . 
  you 'll love it , it 's true : http://www.fort-russ.com/ if someone says this site is fake news , he 's a total loser . 
  unbelievable . 
  lel ... and no mention of the red button ? 
  i did n't expect this to be such a touchy subject but oh well  maybe the way i phrased it ( `` their problem '' ) was not the proper way to say it - i might have got lost in tranlation . 
  i meant it in the sense that it 's not my business to judge them , and ( at least in romanian ) `` not my problem '' and `` not my business '' are almost synonyms ( we say it `` nu e treaba mea '' / `` nu e problema mea '' ) . 
  so i was not implying a problem exists , but rather i was stating it 's their business and not mine to judge ( their problem , and not mine - but `` problem '' in the sense of `` matter '' / subject/issue/thing , not in the sense of a problem per se , as a negative thing ) . 
  i confess that i 'm not familiarised with the psychology of homosexuality and i did n't put too much thought in the `` choice '' thing . 
  superficially , i might have seen it as a matter of choice and i stand corrected - i can understand it 's not a matter of choice , as per your explanation . 
  regarding the evolutionary perspective , i 'm rather stubborn on this . 
  we as living beings are meant to be born , grow and prosper , multiply and pass our genes to the offspring . 
  this is just how evolution works . 
  i did n't know homosexuality is common in animals ( maybe except bonobos ) and even if it is , i do n't think it 's normal , for the very reason expressed in my preceding statement . 
  all the animals `` do whatever is needed '' to survive and pass their genes . 
  this is how evolution works . 
  if hypothetically or not , an 100 % homosexual animal would exists , this is a no-go from a purely evolutionary perspective .
