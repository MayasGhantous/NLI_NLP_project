  i wonder why the romanians were the only ones to give their reply in inches . 
  stupid guiness book record : http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-sausage romania also held the title for longest smoked sausage ( in 2008 ) but those damn germans broke it : http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-smoked-sausage/, 
  being 5 times longer than vasco da gama , i 'm sure the plan was to fill 5 out of its 6 lanes , with one lane left for the people eating the sausage . 
  but `` abuse of power '' / `` malfeasance in office '' or `` official misconduct , '' is [ according to wikipedia ] * the commission of an unlawful act , done in an official capacity , which affects the performance of official duties . 
  malfeasance in office is often grounds for a for cause removal of an elected official by statute or recall election . 
  abuse of power can also mean a person using the power they have for their own personal gain . 
  * [ end wikipedia quote ] not really the same as bribery . 
  i think there might exist abuse of power without any bribe ( or without any gain ) - e.g. 
  when the official abuse of his/her power just to do harm to somebody , or to help a relative but without being bribed ( albeit this is maybe also a form of `` gain '' but not really `` personal '' ) . 
  also you could have bribe without abuse of power ( e.g. 
  a doctor being bribed just for doing what he/she was about to do anyway - perform surgery ) . 
  my feelings are mixed about usr . 
  their usp ( if i may use a marketing term ) is `` everybody else are corrupted , we are not '' . 
  while this sounds nice in theory , there is one problem : when something sounds too nice to be true ... 
  i do n't know ... 
  i 'd need to be quite naive or too optimistic to believe it . 
  obviously , they are less corrupt than psd ( the ruling party ) but that 's so easy - everybody else is less corrupt than psd . 
  then , even if they are less corrupt , what does this prove ? 
  they have n't been to power yet . 
  what if power corrupts almost anyone ? 
  and last , they undoubtedly have a high percentage of well-educated people in their ranks ( at least at leadership level ) but do they have enough experience to govern ? 
  i mean a nobel prize winner in medicine is not necessary a good minister of health - and nope , there 's no nobel prize winner in their ranks , i was just saying ; that is , unless they get [ emil palade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_emil_palade ) - but that 's too late now , he 's dead ( sorry if this sounded cynical or disrespectful , no offence meant ) my regret regarding usr ( and formerly usb ) is that their rise to the political scene has fragmented the opposition even more . 
  now there are three major opposition parties ( if i can count pmp as `` major '' ) and until now they were unable to unite in a coalition , and might never be . 
  so that only makes it easier for psd . 
  [ china !?

   it 's more like a park than a square . 
  also , on google maps the two halves are actually two different plazas/squares : to the right ( = north ) plaza enoseos , and to the left ( = south ) plaza leonida vlachou bah , i 'm just being envious  nice places you got in greece , guys , do n't mean to ruin your fun :d, 
  for those interested ( especially those in romania ) , 17:00 cet = 18:00 eet , 
  we already made [ teleorman great again ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bun8m9w.jpg ) - teleorman , the county where our great leader liviu dragnea is from - and soon romania will be great again !, 
  it is not true that romania is worse !, 
  that is fake news !, 
  fake news !, 
  - it 's true , believe me !, 
  when we have corrupt politicians we organize a huge protest , it 's huge , believe me , very huge !, 
  really huge !, 
  the largest huge protest ever in romania !, 
  like over 500.000 people huge throughout the whole country . 
  so the corrupt politicians do not dare to be corrupt , and that is a fact !, 
  they also go behind bars !, 
  also our dna ( national anti-corruption directorate ) has romanian dna ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . 
  romanian dna is the most pure and uncorrupted dna !, 
  it 's true !, 
  anyone who denies this is making false news !,

  scotland , you do n't need to remain alone !, 
  we , romanians , would gladly welcome you , with open arms , as the 4th major province of romania . 
  romania = wallachia + transylvania + moldova , and , if you will , + scotland !, 
  edit : corrected typos . 
  2nd edit : the order i listed the provinces is irrelevant , it does n't mean scotland would be 4th in importance . 
  in fact , we can move our capital city to scotland ( well , not move it really , but make edinburgh our capital city ) . 
  1939 : ribbentrop - molotov ... poland screwed , then wwii 1945 : roosevelt & churchill - stalin ( yalta conference ) ... whole eastern & central europe ( including half of germany ) screwed , then cold war 2017 : trump - putin ... what next ? 
  edit : it seems that the roosevelt & churchill trolls / web brigades are down-voting this . 
  heh , you ca n't afford the truth much ? 
  it 's true . 
  anyone who denies this is making fake news ( cnn you hear me ? ) . 
  just the other day i was in norway to buy broccoli and they asked for a valid eu passport/id card , checked my residence permit , then only sold me only one broccoli head . 
  also , most of the vegetable shelves were empty , with only some potatoes left . 
  the label on the potatoes bags said : `` made in poland '' - so this is clear proof everything is true . 
  nice . 
  damn romanians , when you 'll come to this party , it 'll be to late and you 'll be exiled to a megathread ... 
  i guess we 're too busy protesting , with all the tv channels transmitting live , no time for funny videos . 
   `` extrapoler '' keyword checks out : http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/extrapoler/32474 :d well in romanian we use it both figuratively ( like `` trend '' / expectation , or even in the sense of foreseeing ) and in the mathematical/scientific sense ( in statistics and charts - like the linear/polynomial/etc intra/extrapolation line you can add to a chart in ms excel ) . 
  i see in french both meanings are valid too . 
  i the context , i had used the scientific/mathematical use . 
  fact is , that guy was a sales & support guy , working in a rather technical field ( medical equipment ) so it was hard for me to believe he never did an inter - / extrapolation for a chart . 
  i did this in university , a few times , for different fields of study , when analyzing experimental ( physics/chemistry ) or statistical data . 
  regarding romania , if we extrapolate * the 2016 -  2017 change , the `` nem tudja/nem vlaszol '' ( probably i do n't know / i do n't want to answer ) will reach 0 in 2023 and the inkabb rossz ( `` rather bad '' according to google translate ) will reach 1 % in 2025 . 
  that is , if the evolution is constalty going in the same direction . 
  ( * ) funny fact , i met a guy from britain once , who said this word , extrapolate , does not exist in english . 
  after double-checking it on cambridge dictionary online , i was soooo proud :d edit : to be honest , you only need two points to extrapolate a set of data , but that extrapolation would be rather inaccurate , 
  i 'm not sure if there 's more to it , but for me , it sounds very funny and silly in the same time ; plus , igor is typically a russian name , so when saying `` most of the times he 's very igor '' is like , you know , most of the time he 's very ( pro- ) russian, 
   epic ~ ~ sax ~ ~ ** sex ** guy bullshit . 
  that is fake news , sir . 
  it 's true . 
  the city of belgium invented sex , not that guy .

  igor dodon - most of the times he is very igor , but he can be quite dodon sometimes , 
  belgium : a beautiful city , somewhere in europe . 
  netherlands : people tell me they wanted first , to be second , seems a little contradictory ...

  priceless quote i just stumbled on , from gina casey , spokesmen for boiron : *** `` of course it is safe . 
  there 's nothing in it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oscillococcinum#efficacy homeopathy is based on some mumbo-jumbo that says that you do n't need an active ingredient but only some `` molecule memory '' - e.g. 
  the medicine/pill `` remembers '' it had been in contact with some substance ... and only that `` memory '' renders it efficient . 
  an oscillococcinum pill contains less than the weight of a proton ( so practically nothing ) of a very special duck liver raised somewhere in switzerland , specially prepared and diluted a huge number of times . 
  or something similar , i forgot the full story , but you can find it somewhere online , it 's a nice and entertaining read . 
  from wikipedia , about homeopathy : < < the low concentration of homeopathic preparations , which often lack even a single molecule of the diluted substance , has been the basis of questions about the effects of the preparations since the 19th century . 
  modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of `` water memory '' , according to which water `` remembers '' the substances mixed in it , and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed .

  you need romanian dna to fight political class corruption . 
  pun intended , 
  this is the best part and unfortunately it 's what romanians who support psd do not understand , do not believe or do not care : * the dna has been accused of being overzealous . 
  but if any adjustments to its operations are required , a mass amnesty and decriminalising an important class of offences are not the way to achieve this . 
  the psd argued that by indicting more officials from its party than from any other , the agency displayed political bias .
