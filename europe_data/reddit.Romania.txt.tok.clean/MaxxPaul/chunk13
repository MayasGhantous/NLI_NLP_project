  opposition parties counter that the psd simply has a worse corruption problem . 
  they are right . 
  not a health hazard * per se * but by substituting for `` real '' therapy like , when you treat pneumonia with sugar pills ( e.g. 
  sadly , there are huge financial interests involved ( the manufacturers and obviously some doctors ) - in the end , patients pay - with money , and sometimes with their health ( or more ) . 
  of course , you thought the number of inhabitants in a country , per 1000 people , does n't matter ? 
  finland has about 2000 inhabitants per 1000 people , that 's about 2 inhabitants per capita , while romania has a much lower number due to migrant workers relocated to spain ( for picking strawberries ) and to uk ( for picking pockets ... and benefits ) . 
  if russian media implies that macron in france is a `` us agent '' , i wonder who could have come with the idea that the romanian protesters against corruption ( as well as the opposition parties ) are controlled by ... soros foundation - an idea the social-democrats , currently in power in romania , have been pushing a lot . 
  my take ? 
  either the russians , or just the current power , using the russian model . 
  funny fact , there are quite a lot of their voters that actually believe the soros conspiracy thing . 
  edit : oh , but macron is a soros agent too , according to frexit supporters : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fogaqwpaqgc that figures . 
  also because opposition is fragmented , which very well suits sdp 's needs ( sometimes they even manage to create alliances with former factions formerly in opposition - like the present one with alde ), 
  if putin has the chance , he will try to help governments he controls climb to power , in all the eastern europe countries . 
  ** for this , right now , i 'm really starting to believe in a united eu !, 
  ** ( pardon the pleonasm , since eu should be united by definition , from its name . ), 
  thank you , bulgaria !, 
  edit : ( however , i could n't find the full information or source on ziare.com , just some mention in the comments . 
  is this for real ? 
  our ruling party leader [ has bigger plans ] ( https://i.imgur.com/cc1zaza.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not sure if that would be a second , but it 's at least great . 
  i do n't know but for sure they explain the moustache ( or hamster as we romanians call it especially in his case ) . 
  he 's trying to grow a moustache in order to hide his teeth . 
  as a science fiction lover , i ca n't wait for a new kind of regime to appear - ai-cracy ( ai as in artificial intelligence ) or computocracy . 
  no more parliament and government , just a powerful supercomputer/server that gets input directly from the people and converts it to laws . 
  much closer to `` power of the people '' , nothing inbetween the people and the laws . 
  of course , that 's an utopia but i have the right to dream . 
  actually there 's already a habit , almost like a rule , that i quite admire ( even considering my recent mixt feelings about uk lately ) and makes be curious why they do it . 
  all or most of all ( not sure ) uk 's ambassadors in romania speak romanian when giving speeches to us . 
  of course , with strong accent , of course , not fluently , but they do it . 
  it 's nice and somehow flattering that they do this , even if , obviously , they do not really need to/are not required to . 
  i 'm not sure if they only read a text , or they really speak it/understand what they 're saying/reading , but still . 
  i understand that would be a mistake ( which he shortly did and is already criticised for ) . 
  i think the law might forbid him to involve , i 'm not sure , but even if not true , it would be advisable to leave the protests as they are - as protests of the `` regular '' population , and not to give them a political turn . 
  ( edit ) true , no word on modifying the criminal code and procedure , nothing about amnesty or pardons , during their campaign . 
  only promises of economic boom , higher wages/pensions and lower taxes ( to be fair , they did lower some taxes but how will they be able to sustain this ? ), 
  the society is kinda divided , sadly between elders and middle-aged/youth . 
  a lot of families are in these state ( of course , we do not fight each other , but strongly disagree ) . 
  we pay the pensions ( as tax from our wages ) , we want to have a say . 
  but the `` pensioners '' , the elders are ( i think ) more in numbers than the employees so there are plenty of voters for psd . 
  lately , some of the youth , disappointed with the political class , either started not to care for the elections or shifted their vote preference from other parties to psd , because the opposition is divided too , and not without their legal problems ( in much lower number but still ) . 
  meanwhile , the elder are very stubborn and keep their political views - and vote psd . 
  also , the elder are more `` responsible '' and see voting as a duty ( or something they really need to do - after all , they 'll get a pension rise ) , while the youth are busier , more active and have a lot more interests . 
  the elections were held during the winter celebrations and fairs before christmas . 
  to be honest , i did not manage to vote because i was paying a long visit to some friends ( it was during the weekend ) and i did n't see the time fly . 
  when i wanted to go to vote i realised it was after the closing hours . 
  i 'm embarrassed/ashamed now but i wonder how many others `` forgot '' to vote just like me . 
  they keep insisting they were legitimately elected , which is unfortunately true on a purely technical level ( at least in part due to low voter turnout , but also due to their populism and demagogy ^ \u00a7 ) . 
  ^ \u00a7 in their campaign , they 've promised simultaneously to lower taxes and raise wages and pensions , which is absurd and unsustainable unless they also increase our country 's debt to possibly dangerous levels , while the debt will remain to be handled in the future , by the present-day children and the employed youth/middle-aged , the very people that support the pensions of the elder - psd 's main electorate . 
  for them it 's a choice between ** hardline ** ( = keep the power and opportunity to steal , rendering some of their criminal trials null and clearing some of their previous convictions ; dragnea , psd 's leader , might even be able to claim the pm chair , even if just today he said he has absolutely no intention to do that ) vs '' ** listening to the street ** '' which equals for dragnea risk of going to jail because of his second criminal trial underway ( and some few more hundreds govt . / local psd officials under trials for the very criminal offences they are trying to decriminalise or reduce the penalty for ) . 
  it 's almost a no-brainer for them : they 're holding to this as long as they can . 
  they do n't give a shit on public ( internal or abroad / ue ) opinion considering what 's at stake for them , and they keep invoking the fact that some 3 million people voted for them in the recent elections ( of course , they would n't admit people voted them because the tempted them with empty promises and were mostly ill-informed by the psd-controlled media , including tv channels `` romania tv '' , antena 1 and antena 3 ) . 
  and last , the goverment decrees ( actually should be translated as bills or ordinances ) have the same power as regular laws . 
  the executive/goverment ordinances in romania follow the french model explained [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ordonnance ) . 
  they do n't need to be approved by the parliament or even get officially ratified . 
  the regular laws , yes , after being debated and voted by the parliament need to be ratified by the president ( he can return them the the parliament proposing amendments ) . 
  but not the ordinances , which are promulgated directly by the govt and become valid by simply publishing them in romania 's official legislative gazette ( monitorul official ) . 
  edit : normally , the govt . 
  ordinances are meant for emergecy/urgency situations , that 's why their complete proper name is `` ordonan\u021b\u0103 de urgen\u021b\u0103 '' ( emergecy ordinance ) . 
  this is an issue under scrutiny now : what really was the emergency situation here ? 
  to be fair , ruling the country via ordinances was an old habit in romania and there are plenty of precedents , but this time they really went overboard by trying to pass the ordinance in such a way and such blatantly in their interest ) . 
  also psd had the parliamentary majority for quite a few years , why now ? 
  why did n't they debate these as regular laws in the past ( including the most recent years , when we had a non-psd , technocrat govt. , but still psd had the parliamentary majority ) . 
  i tell you what was the `` emergency '' : dragnea 's criminal suit , which was about to proceed further these very days . 
   [ italy does not trust even itself ] ( http://new1.fjcdn.com/pictures/don+t+trust+italy_1c8bce_5446067.png ) from that table , what 's the view in france : most arrogant : france least arrogant : france o_o french guys , make up your mind , you cant be both most arrogant and least arrogant in the same time !, 
  not fabricated , proof here ( open the link posted by / u/dngrs and scroll down to the first audio clip , below the video ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rnrp9/liviu_dragnea_to_swiss_media_when_asked_about/dd8o70c/, 
  that 's more like a laugh or grin and it motivates me the most .

  just bought a slingshot . 
  i promise i 'll throw meatballs and candy for him , through the bars of his prison . 
  thank you , mr. timmermans . 
  out of beta !, 
  dragnea 10.0 final , long term support edition . 
  now with small hands !, 
  coming soon ... to a jail next to you . 
  some of us have school aged kids and have to wake up early . 
  tomorrow is friday , different story . 
  many people have agreed to meet there during the weekend . 
  * insert nervous laugh here *, 
  it 's not that simple , with family and kids going to school next morning . 
  but tomorrow evening , weekend begins and i 'll be there , one way or the other . 
  unfortunately i feel we are left with no solutions . 
  they just do n't care , the damage was done and will continue to be done in many different ways ( economy , foreign partners etc ) . 
  the only good part in this is that maybe some of psd 's voters realised psd did not deserve their votes ; and those who did n't like psd but also did n't vote , maybe they realise that was a mistake . 
  i ca n't troll in peace because of guys like you :(, 
  that 's more like it . 
  i like this one a lot more :d op picture is past . 
  the pic you posted - represents the future . 
  they have been removing posts from timeline ( peluzacatalinhildan page on fb ) , but google cache does n't forget that easily http://imgur.com/a/8dlob, 
  they have absolute majority - psd in coalition with a smaller , opportunistic party , alde ( itself formed by joining a psd puppet party and a break-away liberal faction that wanted to hang to power in 2014 with psd within the `` social-liberal '' coalition ) . 
  they should have hacked the election process , then . 
  the parliament is directly elected by the voters in romania , as well as the president ( that 's why we are a a semi-presidential republic ) . 
  on the other hand , government is basically `` elected '' by the parliament . 
  so practically it 's common sense that the government and the parliament would represent the same majority ( while the president might be from the opposition , situation named `` cohabitation '' - like in france ) . 
  so if the government and parliament represent the same political party , it would be quite unusual and maybe illogical that the parliament would n't agree to an ordinance issued by the govt . 
  ( usually , the elites of the same party that forms the majority in parliament , become the members of the govt . 
  ; liviu dragnea wanted to be prime minister , but he could n't be elected due to a previous conviction , so he `` had '' to be content with one of the parliament chambers ' presidency chair ) . 
  the parliament sometimes `` converts '' an ordinance of the govt . 
  with some additions/modifications into a law , but this might take time and it 's not really compulsory . 
  if no addition/modificatin is needed , the ordinance remains valid years . 
  all right then .
