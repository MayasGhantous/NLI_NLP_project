  bbc was a bit late to the media party though , on this topic . 
  the yesterday ( feb. 1st ) article you mentioned did n't specify the hour of publishing . 
  but when i searched for intl. 
  media coverage on this subject ( some time during the night between february 1st and 2nd ) , i easily found the wp article : https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/01/in-corruption-riddled-romania-officials-now-allow-room-for-modest-abuses/ published at 7:40 am washington time , but no bbc article . 
  in bbc 's defense , 7:40 am in washigton is 12:40 pm gmt and 02:40 am in romania , so maybe the british journalists were just sleeping . 
  that was the night the ordinance passed ( the official legislative gazette in romania , `` monitorul oficial '' obviously not `` sleeping '' at this late hour ) . 
   i 'm not sure brexit was about romania not in the slightest . 
  also not about benefits , gypsy ethnicity beggars or pickpocketers with romanian citizenship , not about uk `` paying '' to eu for the poorer countries , either . 
  i do n't want to get into this polemic . 
   did you have to elect them twice , they are quite a new political party with a lot of young people , established some time before the most recent local elections . 
  at first , they were only present in bucharest so that explains the initial name . 
  afterwards , they expanded in ( presumably ) all the country . 
  someone with more information might correct me , but i think in their short existence up to now ( maybe 1 year ) they managed to reach more than 10 % popularity , in avereage , with even 20 % -30 % in bucharest 's 6 districts . 
  now !, 
  save europe union , now !, 
  yeah , and that proves what ? 
  that i 'm paranoid ( 25 % as per my own estimation ) but also making fun ( 75 % ) and that i might have already made my opinion that most of the english people do not like romanians . 
  well , you have a referendum and plenty of statistics that proves it . 
  one swallow does not a spring make . 
  or , the translate romanian version one flower does n't make spring of course i was a little hyperbolic , of course from time to time you could see , as an accident , correct journalistic work about romania , but most of the time it 's what i wrote above . 
  has a nice touch to it . 
  a * je ne sais quoi * that makes you want more . 
  wait until you know the previous name : save bucharest union = '' ** u ** niunea ** s ** alvati ** b ** ucurestiul '' , or ... usb, 
  well , it just does n't work that way . 
  the parliament ca n't overturn emergency ordinances , but they can be attacked by the ombudsman or the judiciary power / constitutional court ( this is what 's being tried ) . 
  i was hoping to read an allusion to a current leader . 
  i forgot how politically correct can the german media be . 
  one more worry for losing stability in europe , on my paranoid list . 
  one more fuse for the powder keg . 
  it 's not enough we have putin , terrorism , refugee/migrants crysis , brexit , trump , now turkey too ? 
  about this esztergom memorial ... 
  it would be funny to notice how easily people forget , if it would n't be tragic instead . 
  * the low-key , 5-metre ( 15-foot ) memorial stands in esztergom , an historic town on the danube river upstream of budapest . 
  it depicts an * *** angel *** * with inscriptions at its pedestal praising russian soldiers who fought in both world wars there . 
  * * hungarian media quoted russia 's ambassador , vladimir sergeev , as saying the monument demonstrated the strength of hungarian-russian cooperation . 
  * * `` it is very symbolic , '' sergeev said . 
  * an angel ? 
  prasing the russian soldiers ? 
  what about a memorial for the war rapes committed by red army servicemen ( including in hungary ) ? 
  i know there is one in gdansk . 
  if you do n't know what i mean , read below : https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3600834.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes#hungary https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/11/24/silenced-shame-hungarian-women-remember-wartime-rapes/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1382565/red-army-troops-raped-even-russian-women-as-they-freed-them-from-camps.html, 
  well british journalism only features romania in invented/fabricated news - like the sky news gun smuggling scandal [ original documentary here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f8cwvq3hdu ) , [ spread in other media outlets like here ] ( http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/sky-news-correspondent-says-romania-stop-trolling-as-broadcaster-stands-by-report-on-illegal-arms-dealers/ ) , [ declared fake by authorities , so called smugllers found and proved hunters acting a script for sky news ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/romanian-investigators-charge-british-journalists-with-spreading/ ) , [ proved fake ] ( http://www.stopfake.org/en/diicot-head-sky-news-feature-report-on-arms-trafficking-in-romania-was-staged/ ) , also like the [ horse meat scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_horse_meat_scandal ) ( where romania was the convenient scapegoat ) and many others , ... or in carefully chosen news selected not for their importance but for being derogatory towards romania / showing it in a bad light ( like channel 4 's series `` romanians are coming '' which was mostly about romanians economic migrants of gypsy ethnicity , ignoring the largely superior number of educated romanian expats who work in uk and contribute to its economy , and also to its budged through the taxes they pay ) . 
  the worse part about this is that - in case of fake news proven fake - they almost never refute the initial wrong information , what about some apologies or reparation for damage ? 
   huh . 
  that is something romania differs from portugal then : here the president has the power to veto laws that pass parliament i 'm not sure it 's different . 
  as i said , the romanian president can veto ( but only once , i think ) a law that passed through the parliament . 
  if the president does this , he tells the parliament what are his objections , and the parliament can reanalyze/debate the law then submit it a second time to the president for promulgation ( signing ) . 
  but he ca n't veto an emergency ordinance ( / decree/bill ) issued by the government . 
  an ordinance ( a.k.a. 
  [ `` ordonnance '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ordonnance ) in france ) is similar to a law , in the sense that it walks like a law , acts like a law and quacks like a law , but it 's not really law because it 's not issued by the parliament , but by the executive power ( government , in romania , or council of ministers , in france ) `` in an area of law normally reserved for primary legislation enacted by the parliament '' . 
  this is meant for the executive to be able to pass a `` law '' in a very quick way ( usually meant for emergency / urgency situations ) bypassing the parliament . 
  this kind of `` law '' ( in fact called ordinance ) can not be vetoed by the president but has the same `` power '' as a `` regular '' law . 
  sometimes an ordinance is later debated by the parliament and `` converted '' in a `` regular '' law . 
  of course nominal figures would , berlin has 3.5 mil.population and bucharest 2 mil . 
  but still , per capita is the more relevant data and for me it was hard to believe . 
  according to some statistics i 've just read to satisfy my curiosity , the gross average monthly wage in berlin is 2950 $ ( minus 30 % -40 % taxes that would lead to about 1917 $ netto ) while in bucharest it 's 618 $ netto , three times less . 
  in order for bucharest to have a higher purchase power , that would need prices and cost of living to be less than 1/3 of those in berlin - that 's hard to believe , because i know the prices in germany . 
  the restaurants are more expensive , but supermarkets such as lidl have the same price or even lower ( ! ), 
  for some goods . 
  lower , yes , for clothing and tassimo espresso capsules , in germany vs bucharest . 
  as for accommodation , rents are higher , but apartments comparable in size and position are not that different in price ( i remember seeing a price of as low as 80.000 $ for an apartment ) . 
  i am indeed unaware of prices of other stuff like electricity , water etc. 
  oth i 'm not sure how average wage correlates with gdp ppp . 
  edit : yes , after i wrote the above i realised the data is for gdp not average wage . 
  i mean , the companies based in bucharest might make a lot of profit but still offer low wages ( and keep more profit to them or spend it on anything else but salaries ) . 
   ~ ~ ministry of justice ~ ~ ministry of truth ( ctfu ), 
  he can re-submit for parliamentary debate regular laws , issued by the parliament . 
  but emergency bills ( decrees/ordinances ) issued by the goverment , he ca n't . 
  ctfu . 
  not shame , but : shame !, 
  shame !, 
  shame !, 
  shame !, 
  damn i ca n't help myself ... hijacked the press conference and then what ? 
  smuggled it outside country to a soros foundation bunker ? 
  soros , give back psd the press conference , now !, 
  or else ... 
  no problem , it was 75 % joke , 25 % paranoia . 
  i might be a little paranoid or maybe it 's due to an inferiority complex we romanians have ( or just me ) . 
  i had other posts removed in the past too ( like when i came too late to the castle-cattle-kettle party with my `` kitten '' post ) so my paranoia must be overreacting . 
  englishmen - even if halfbreed ( according to flag/flair ) - do n't like us romanians ... lolz, 
  the prominent romanian journalist is cristian tudor popescu and he is quite a `` funny '' guy . 
  let me explain . 
  most of the things he says , are well thought and well said . 
  maybe his language/vocabulary is a little too harsh for a journalist but still almost within acceptable limits ( he does use a lot of strong epithets , though ) . 
  i usually see him on digi24 tv channel , a channel usually featuring respectable guests , smart reporters and good journalistic work . 
  but ... what i do n't like about mr. popescu is the ** foam at his mouth ** ( not only figuratively , but also literally ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i mainly respect this guy - i have to say this again - and i 'm usually on the same wavelength with him ( although there might be some opinions i do n't agree with ) . 
  but when he speaks , when he gets into an angry tirade criticizing some corrupt politician or some scandalous event , he 's able to talk for minutes without pausing to swallow his saliva . 
  so this saliva of him gathers near one of his mouth 's corners and starts foaming - a white , unpleasantly looking foam . 
  ( gee , the wonders of full hd television ) . 
  my advice for him would be : take a small break in your discourse , lick your lips , gather your saliva from the corner of your mouth , maybe drink a bit of water , then resume talking . 
  i 'm fine with the epithets , with the hard and harsh talk no matter how unusual from a prominent journalist ( after all , they fully deserve them - the corrupt politicians ) but please , keep the saliva in , not out !, 
  and please , no more white foam !, 
   no offense meant , just saying . 
   president is the head of foreign affairs and defense the president , as chief of defense , should invoke martial law and overthrow the government , in order to save/preserve the state and the state of law ( *** rechtsstaat *** ) . 
   a message from a romanian citizen hint : the only citizen in full colour . 
  the rest of them are b & w. 
  haha , someone can afford to joke , writing ( most probably ) from denmark - the most ** un-corrupt ** country in the world ( according to statistics ) . 
  i envy your optimism ( and your country 's politics and society ) .
