  bucharest higher than berlin ? 
  i just ca n't believe that , and i do live in bucharest . 
  why is this labelled `` controversial '' ? 
  `` they must have '' was just a funny assumption ( a joke ) i had no idea who really invented polandball - thanks for the background info !, 
  if i 'm not mistaken , the president signs ( promulgates ) the `` regular '' lows , those that are voted and passed through the parliament , but not the emergency decrees ( ordinances ) issued by the government directly . 
  the latter can be directly promulgated by the government , bypassing the parliament and presidency , in `` emergency '' situations . 
  in this case the emergency situation was that liviu dragnea ( president of the psd party and pm wannabee ) was about to go to jail if found guilty and convicted in his second criminal suit , currently ongoing . 
  they must have invented polandball . 
  marie s. curie was a polish scientist who contributed to radioactivity discovery and research and won two nobel prizes we ( romania ) helped the polish [ evacuate their national treasure during wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evacuation_of_polish_national_treasures_during_world_war_ii ) ( and also some refugees ) they helped us with funding to build a [ hospital in bucharest ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/spitalul_clinic_de_urgen%c8%9b%c4%83_pentru_copii_%e2%80%9emaria_sklodowska_curie%e2%80%9d ) after the big 1977 earthquake ; the hospital was initially named polish hospital , currently curie hospital they are catholics and pope paul ii was polish their country was split at the beginning of wwii and their people suffered a lot `` polish plumbers '' was a meme in western europe like the more recent one for romanians in spain ( `` strawberry pickers '' ) some of the polish people do not know romania very well ( i suppose the younger generation ) and some might not like us or think romanians are gypsies, 
  europe !, 
  i found the wp article was `` featured '' in multiple other newspapers ' online editions . 
  as for the guillotine hint , we 're living a different century . 
  forced labour for life is a much more civilised punishment . 
  i could live with that ... ( that did n't sound very well ) ... 
  i mean , i could live with they doing that for the rest of their lives ... , 
   justice minister florin iordache said the measure will decriminalize cases of official misconduct in which the financial damage is valued at less than 200,000 lei ( $ 47,800 ) . 
   just wow . 
  we 're so rich we can afford a few thousands cases $ 40k here and there ... 
   i would recommend holding ** political ** violence as a last resort . 
  i think ** physical ** violence is due now ... hehe, 
  happening now , live : http://www.digi24.ro/live/digi24 http://webtv.realitatea.net/live, 
   he cant be the pm anymore . 
  come back and read this post in a few months ( after his first sentence is erased , i just ca n't assume the law wo n't pass ) . 
  oth he might enjoy the role of grindeanu 's puppeteer - same power and control , less exposure and risk for the future to come `` abuses of power '' ( of course , lower than the threshold , just to be on the safe side ), 
   he still has the old sentence though for that , he 's waiting for the amnesty ; then no more `` old sentence '' ... gg dragnea he flawlessly fucked about 49 % of romania 's population ( might be more - if they did n't vote , we ca n't know for sure ), 
  my somehow inexact post along the lines a few days ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pi6cm/bucharest_right_now/dcsfeq5/, 
   the man even said he has no idea what the changes are about . 
  of course , he was conveniently visiting us while this plot started - by pure coincidence - while he was away . 
  as we romanians say , `` he neither ate garlic , nor did his mouth stink of it '' . 
   well maybe we do n't need western europe ? 
  france , germany , netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria , denmark , sweden , norway , iceland , findland , maybe spain , portugal and italy , i guess you meant eastern europe :( hey , do n't leave us out !, 
  ( again ), 
  thank you . 
  you managed to get rid of some of my inferiority complex . 
  i guess that 's a first step , 
   unite into one single organism and what would that organism be ? 
  as this video [ nicely explains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lj127tku4q ) it , a country is a social construct . 
  to have a country , you need society 's acceptance of the country . 
  i take it you 're french . 
  would you see a romanian as your co-national , as your equal within your proposed * organism * 's borders ? 
  and even if your answer is yes , would most of the french people do ? 
  to answer your question , yes , that 'd be nice , but not gon na happen . 
  not this century . 
  there is too much superiority complex to loose by some , and maybe too much inferiority complex to get rid of , by the others ( assuming your `` organism '' was meant to include those , too ) . 
  there 's a nice fable by a romanian poet , grigore alexandrescu , that might have some relevance to this . 
  if i can manage to find it in english translation i 'll edit this post . 
  edit : the dog and the puppy a fable by grigore alexandrescu published in 1842 `` oh how very much i dislike some of these beasts , such us the wolves , bears , lions and few others , who think that they are worth something !, 
  if they descend from a noble species , that 's just fortunate : even i may be noble , but i do n't like to show it off . 
  people often say that in civilised countries there 's equality . 
  there 's change everywhere and the world is remoulding , only our pride does n't want to leave us alone . 
  as for me , everybody else knows , i 'm happy to accept , if all the other beasts , even the stupid , call me a dog , and not your majesty . '' that 's how the other day , samson , the big yard dog who barked very loudly , was talking to one ordinary ox . 
  samurache , the puppy , sat to one side , like a mere outsider , simply watched , and listened to their conversation , that they had no pride , nor were they hard to please , so he instantly approached them , to show them all , he loved them : `` your way of thinking '' , he said `` i think it 's wonderful , i give thanks to your sentiment , my brothers . '' `` us , your brothers ? '' answered samson , full of hatred , `` we 're not your brothers , you good for nothing rascal !, 
  we 'll give you a beating , one you shall remember . 
  do you know who we are , and how dare you , talk to us that way , you shameless toady ? '' `` but you were saying ... '' `` and , why do you care ? 
  am i asking you to tell me what i said ? 
  i was talking truth , that i do n't like the pride and that i hate the lions , and want equality but not with little puppies . '' moral : this happens so often among us , and we want equality , but only with those bigger than us . 
  ummm ... is n't that a manhole cover ? 
  the roundabout should be on the left , not visible in the picture . 
  [ i saw what you did there  ], 
  priceless memories . 
  no matter what . 
  and from kettle to megathread . 
  too late for kittens ... :(,

  nothing new in the pharma business ( especially in developing countries , east europe or balkans , africa etc ) . 
  in a lower degree common in the medical devices/equipment business too . 
  i remember a case involving pfizer in poland ( ca n't find the link ) . 
  also pfizer : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-settlement-idusbre8760wm20120807 other illegal practices are common too , such as [ undeclared wage payments ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0965156x.2012.718570?journalcode=cdeb20 ) ( aka `` black money '' in romania ) . 
  i heard an acquaintance of mine , who heard it from an acquaintance of her ... ( repeat this a couple of times ) ... that roche romania did this on a regular base some ( many ) years ago ( not sure if it 's still common practice in the company ) - it was the norm to pay employees the main income without declaring it and without paying income taxes , while the declared income was just a small part of the total amount . 
  [ eradicate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eradication ) ? 
  hmm , sounds a little extreme . 
  i hope finland finds a way to do this in a civilized and painful manner ( lethal injection maybe ? ) . 
  but if they quit smoking , are they spared ? 
  uk 's reply : so long , and thanks for all the fish . 
  that means they are certainly dolphins . 
  what some people do n't understand - those who ask why do n't let a legitimate government do its job - is that if the bill ( ordinance ) would have been promulgated ( and for that the only thing needed was to publish it in [ monitorul oficial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monitorul_oficial ) ) it would have produced its legal effects instantly ( meaning instant amnesty for all the eligible convicts ) even if in contradiction with other laws , even if proved unconstitutional and even if canceled later ( due to the [ `` most favorable law '' ] ( http://www.drept.unibuc.ro/a-brief-analysis-of-the-principles-of-most-favorable-law.-controversies-and-directions-of-interpretation-in-the-new-criminal-code-nicolae-irina-raluca-s614-a925-en.htm ) principle ) . 
  this type of bill , called `` emergency '' ordinance , is promulgated by the government without passing through the parliament ( and in fact is intended really for emergency situations ) and can be effective even the very next day , without any public or parliamentary debate . 
  additionally , the constitution of romania forbids modifying the criminal code ( penal code ) through `` emergency '' ordinance ( and that was exactly what the ordinance was meant to do ) ; so the constitutional court would have been able to immediately ( within days , most probably ) cancel the ordinance . 
  but nevertheless , since it would have been already published in the monitorul oficial , with its legal effects already applied even for a day , its cancellation ( as being unconstitutional ) would have been too late - the bill would have already served its intended purpose and those for whom it was meant would have been already amnestied . 
  dragnea has one suspended sentence and one ongoing trial ( for instigation to abuse of power / official misconduct ) . 
  if he is sentenced in the second trial , he goes to jail ( you can get your sentence suspended only once ) . 
  if his first conviction gets cancelled , he can get his second conviction suspended as it would become his first conviction ( after the previous is cleared ) . 
  that 's why the amnesty is meant for suspended sentences too - to help dragnea . 
  also , they bill they wanted to pass intended to decriminalize abuse of power ( if some conditions are not met ) , so they are working on two fronts to `` wash '' dragnea ( he 'd get the chance his second trial to have no purpose ) . 
  i saw this on a news channel earlier . 
  such a tragedy . 
  according to that [ report ( in romanian ) ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/externe/ue/o-romanca-si-copiii-ei-prinsi-in-avalansa-din-italia-652767 ) , one of the survivors is married to a romanian woman . 
  he went outside to get something from the car ( which was parked quite far from the hotel ) when it all happened . 
  the woman and two children like all the others , are still missing and the rescue teams had a difficult task getting there due to the only access road being covered in the snow from the avalanche . 
  i think he meant it figuratively . 
  dodon is russian `` by heart '' or by interest , not by birth ( although , he could really be ethnic russian , i do n't know about that - after all , romania has a president of german ethnicity ) . 
  romania is a semi-presidential republic . 
  while the president is head of state , the prime minister is the head of government and executive power is exercised by both . 
  currently they belong to opposing parties ( aka cohabitation ) so what the president says might matter only 50 % . 
  he is a [ russophile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/igor_dodon#political_views ), 
  all this while the puppeteer who orchestrated psd 's move ( liviu dragnea , leader of the ruling party - psd - and who was barred from being appointed prime minister due to a previous conviction for electoral fraud ) keeps a low profile and attends trump 's swearing-in ceremony ( where he was invited by another felon , elliott broidy ) . 
  i assume dragnea was n't certain his little scheme will end successfully , so he organized it during his absence , in order to mask his involvement . 
  i was wondering how come such an unimportant figure as dragnea managed to get himself invited there ( i thought he must have paid somehow for this invitation just to be able to brag about it ) . 
  til that elliott broidy has close connections to israel . 
  dragnea and other members of psd also frequently visit israel `` for experience exchange '' ( sometimes using public money to pay for the expenses , like in the case of gabriela firea , bucharest 's current mayor ) .
