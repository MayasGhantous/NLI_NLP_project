  [ dragnea , his mustache and ( some of ) his teeth ] ( http://media.obiectiv.info/image/201507/w620/dragnea_95112900.jpg ), 
  lol , funny stuff . 
  yet ... something 's not right ... 
  i like coffee and enjoy the beatles - check , running shoes - check ... but i also like asimov ( and not xml ) ...  i am not normal / : !!, 
  yeah but about restaurant prices being quite low , some say that 's a marketing strategy to make the customers assume ikea 's prices are very affordable . 
  the 2nd quote was from the article , not from u/miskimoon anyway , i might have been overly defensive as per your suggestion but i felt damn good writing it . 
  tie break !, 
  [ those ... hot-dogs ] ( http://www.timesnewroman.ro/files/attach/images/127/419745/magazin_nou_ikea.jpg ) translation : ikea , 1st place in hot-dogs ( krenwurst ) since 1943 . 
   what matters is that we beat bulgarian again yeah and they beat us in pickled cucumbers , rose oil ( and possibly jam ) and tourism  i 'd rather be second place after bulgaria , than 20th before bulgaria , would n't you agree ? 
  as a thought experiement , how would you feel if romania would be the 2nd larger exporter of cars in europe , after bulgaria ? 
  lol - i know , i know , not gon na happen ( any soon :d ), 
   til romanians are bears . 
  romania bears a lot , and has been bearing a lot for centuries , 
   a part of x wants to secede because it has a majority different population and does not want to live together with x any longer how about a large , happy europe , almost like a country , where we all live in peace ? 
  next : the three mandatory laws . 
  a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . 
  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law . 
  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws . 
  i know , and i know you ca n't project the surface of a sphere on a plane surface without some kind of distortion . 
  i was only mentioning google earth because there , the areas of the countries can be seen properly . 
  exactly my thoughts , almost . 
  but if poland holds the presidency , then romania must be the honorary president . 
  also , you forgot the gypsies !, 
  you hate them so much you even did n't include them in your list !, 
  yeah , but look at google earth  anyway , the [ gall-peters projection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gall%e2%80%93peters_projection ) preserves the areas properly , on the expense of shape ( some countries are `` stretched '' ), 
   shit , we hate swedes now ? 
  i can not keep up with this shit . 
  so ... with what shit can you keep with ? 
  other nations are ok , but that 's it , up to the swedes ? 
   she was shocked by the uncertainty and xenophobia experienced by swedes in the uk since the referendum something is not right in this . 
  shocked ? 
  i mean , in the good old days , xenophobia had a clear limit , that you could trust and depend on , right ? 
  ( gypsies , romanians , poles , and maybe bulgarians ) up to a certain ** point ** it was acceptable , it was the `` kinda ok type of xenophobia '' , the xenophobia you knew it existed but you could discretely look away , or seem busy arranging your tie or examining your fingernail polish , the xenophobia you could live with like with a noisy neighbor who nevertheless goes to sleep at 11 pm so in the end it 's not that bad ... but beyond ** that point ** , you start realizing that xenophobia becomes shocking . 
  well , in case the reports of xenophobia towards swedes are real , then that means life serves a lesson : never take limits for granted - some limits are fuzzier than you 'd expect . 
  i wish someone would eli5 what is the limit - up to what point is `` not shocking '' and when has it started bothering or shocking us ? 
  i think ... paris ? 
  even if/wen the fighting stops , the problem ( s ) wo n't be solved any soon . 
  we 've been witnessing the creation of a new frozen conflict zone which will remain in this sate for many years . 
  but who can/should do more to help ukraine , and would it be wise to do it ? 
  it 's a lose-lose situation :(, 
  why the eff do they still use the mercator projection ? 
  it makes countries in the southern europe look so small . 
  finland 's area is no larger than spain 's and iceland is n't larger than romania . 
  in fact spain is almost 50 % larger than finland , while romania is more than double vs iceland . 
  edit - best example : turkey : 783,562 km ^ 2 vs finland 338,424 km ^ 2 and on this kind of map turkey appears smaller than finland . 
   so many potatoes . 
  did they have latvians on board ? 
  does n't matter . 
  eat less pork , more potatoes is the newest recipe for a longer life . 
  look at those japanese in okinawa . 
  ( ok and less radiation , too ) . 
   ice tea foot for the many not speaking romanian : pronounciation is similar to what in romanian ( with moldavian accent ) means `` lem me f ** k you '' ( * [ h ] ai s ' ti foot * - where the h is implied ), 
  i 'm not even reading this . 
  i 'd hate to see the per capita statistics . 
  it must be because i left the r&d field about 20 years ago ... me and some thousands others ... 
   and this is the prime example why european federalisation is a bad idea . 
  and then ...  if you centralise europe , you make it easier for multinationals to influence people in power . 
  federalisation \u2260 centralisation ... or am i wrong ? 
   europe 's security starts with turkey ... and ends with it . 
  well dragos might a a professional photographer , or in any case a better photographer than me ( i 've seen some of his photos ) . 
  but the photo i 've posted was shot by me , this morning , with an old sammy phone . 
  quite true , i hesitated a lot whether i should rotate it or not . 
  so someone actually tied a rope to a car , and snow-wakesurfed ( i do n't even know the proper name for that ) on `` victorei '' ? ... 
  got ta see a video with dat . 
  to get black , you have to lower brightness . 
  then , maybe , 
  no problem , i 've been told i 'm no longer fun at parties like i used to be , 
  just scroll down to the second ( 2nd ) picture - `` toinen kuva '', 
  credit goes to iss , but thank you . 
  i did remove venus ( or mercury , not sure about that ) by cropping the picture , and might have slightly adjusted brightness , however i did n't touch colours . 
  you mean greece , constantinople , right ? 
  is this just in front of the [ national art museum of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_museum_of_art_of_romania ) on [ victory avenue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calea_victoriei ) ? 
  geez !, 
  looks like fun . 
  yes it is .

  nah , our blue is bluer , just like in the picture . 
  i really like this image . 
  i hope i did nothing wrong , but since in space `` there 's no up and down '' , i 've rotated it and reduced gamma a little .

  yay !, 
  i 'm tempted to say eastern europe stronk , can into top 5 !, 
  but actually the number of beds does not reflect the quality of healthcare ( just look who are the bottom 3 places ) . 
  the number of [ doctors per capita ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/db/practising_physicians%2c_2009_and_2014_%28per_100_000_inhabitants%29.png ) should matter too , equipment , health insurance and a lot of others . 
  knowing romania can not into healthcare right now , i ca n't help wondering : were the mortuary beds included in the count too ? 
  j/k but anyway , i think how they use those beds must play some role too . 
  i 'm not into stereotypes , but facts . 
  what was misinformed in my post ? 
  fact 1 : https://www.numbeo.com/crime/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016&amp;region=150 romania has a lower crime index than e.g. 
  france , italy , germany or uk . 
  fact 2 : how many terrorist attacks took place in romania ? 
  maybe you can help me find romania on this list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_terrorism_in_europe_ ( 2014 % e2 % 80 % 93present ) so who 's the one into stereotypes ? 
  if your are really concerned about terrorism , these are n't very good times to do tourism in western europe ( imho ) - and a lot of other parts of the world for that matter . 
  i think in europe , currently , there 's a trade-off ( kinda ) , between safe and nice . 
  western europe sure might be nicer in many ways but i suppose it 's a little on the `` less safe '' side ( in france for example , a state of emergency state has been declared and it 's still in effect ) . 
  eastern europe is safer but might not be your cup of tea , depending on what kind of tourist you are . 
  i might be biased ( i 'm romanian ) , but i think romania is currently among the safest places to be in europe . 
  my family and i were planning for this summer a 4th visit to disneyland paris but in light of the recent terrorist attack we decided we 'd rather spend this summer holiday in our country for the first time in quite a few years .
