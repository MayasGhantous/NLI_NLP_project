  i think we might visit the danube delta for the first time . 
  here is a guide i found with some popular destinations in romania : http://www.touropia.com/best-places-to-visit-in-romania/ for nature , hiking , relaxation and some nice architecture you could visit the painted monasteries in ne romania / bucovina ( [ here are some pictures ] ( http://hellobucovina.com ) ) or maybe the brasov area and the [ bucegi mountains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucegi_mountains ) ( part of the carpathians ) in central romania , with peles castle as a bonus ( in sinaia ) . 
  the [ bran castle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hphsvezuteq ) ( advertised as dracula 's castle ) is in the same area , but be warned , while nice to see , it 's a tourist trap - i would n't recommend it unless you 're interested in the romanian royal family ( that 's where queen marie of romania , princess of edinburgh lived for a while ) . 
  the real `` dracula castle '' is the [ poenari castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poenari_castle ) located more to the south ( e.g. 
  closer to middle east ! ), 
  but that 's a ruin and to visit it you need to climb about 1500 stairs . 
  nice cities to visit are in the central and western part of the country ( brasov , sighisoara , sibiu come to mind ) . 
  as for the capital - bucharest - ymmv , do some research . 
  if that 's a threat , i wonder to whom is it addressed and what caused it . 
  why now ? 
  ah , i knew i should n't have opened this . 
  another virtual slap in romania 's face . 
  i want to visit croatia , that is , when or if the refugee crises ever ends . 
  your highways will come in handy and i 'll spend a lot , as a tourist . 
  you know that inessa sinchougova , like luciana bohne , michel chossudovsky and sites like globalresearch.ca and fort-russ . com are part of the soviet ... 
  i mean putin 's propaganda machine , right ? 
  so what 's the point in providing that link ? 
  so , the other ivans must be all right then , i suppose . 
  like adolf - that 's as good for a name right ? 
  it 's not that adolf hitler has a monopoly on it . 
  i 'm curious how many jews go by the name adolf , or hans for that matter . 
  they are just names , we must n't overthink it . 
   send armed forces fyi russia denied this . 
  they were little green men from mars . 
  i doubt an educated family in uk would n't know ivan is a russian/slavic name . 
  but i guess uk and ussr were indeed on friendly terms even then , and maybe ivan was a fashionable name . 
  after all , in 1941 they 've invaded iran together , in 1944 chuchill ( such a generous guy ) handed eastern europe to stalin , proposing the percentages agreement and even in 1960 ( the year sir ivan rogers was born ) , the 1942 [ twenty-year mutual assistance agreement between the united kingdom and the union of soviet socialist republics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-soviet_treaty_of_1942 ) was still effective . 
  til there are such russophiles in uk . 
  forgive me but otherwise i ca n't explain a family naming a child ivan in the '60s . 
  i wonder if there 's any truth about uk befriending russia ( even more ) after brexit . 
  after all , if there 's profit in this , why would n't they , right ? 
  who ? 
  poland ? 
  and why ? 
  i thought they were doing rather fine . 
  i meant about september 1944 but indeed , as i read more about it , it was n't a very extensive fight ( about 1000 death tall on each side ) . 
  at first i thought it was a more serious campaign like the one romania entered in aug 23rd . 
  joining eu helped , but not enough . 
  the change must come from within . 
  i ca n't help compare romania to finland - both countries got their independence around 1900 ( more or less ) , both fought against the soviets and then against the nazis , both fell under the soviet influence ( but in different ways and degrees ) . 
  the difference is that finland did not really have communism and dictatorship after wwii . 
  some of these facts might be inaccurate , i 'm not a historian , but see where are they now , and where are we . 
  their gdp ( ppp ) per capita is double ( 40k vs 20k ) . 
  heck i 'd be glad to reach 30k like czech rep. , slovenia , slovakia and ( almost ) estonia . 
  then i 'd say we are on the right track . 
  but for now , our progress is just not enough . 
  and i think the problem is at social level - if the people still vote for corrupt and convicted politicians , we wo n't see that progress any soon . 
  i used to think romanians were smart ( and sure , some are ) but let 's do n't forget that we were once a predominantly agrarian country ( used to be `` europe 's granary '' ) and only the elites from the cities received a higher degree of education ( attending universities in paris or vienna , traditionally ) . 
  communists tried to mass-educate the population ( maybe succeed in some degree ) but old habits die hard ( e.g. 
  the habit of being stupid - that 's a joke ... or maybe not ) . 
  the `` smart '' ones always find ways to exploit the stupid ones ( sure , this is valid for the whole word if you think of it ) either by cheating the laws , or by making them ( or both ) . 
  after the communism fell ( more or less ) , the official disapproval of religion ( or too much of it ) and anything mystic disappeared , and people embraced them , a little too much ( they were the forbidden fruits ? ) . 
  the communism was creating engineers , now we have fortune tellers and way too many priests . 
  sometimes i browse the tv channels and see all this shit on 1/4 of them - horoscopes , teleshopping featuring all kind of pseudosciencific medicine ... it 's gross and scary . 
  the respect for education and science , which was maybe state politics during communism , is gone . 
  this is not going to ascend us very soon from the old status quo - of a mostly uneducated and agrarian country . 
  i do n't regret communism , absolutely not , and i love my county , but the progress we do , is too slow . 
   i wouldnt say its quite as black and white ummm ... but the 2 % migrants committing 22 % of criminality are from mahgreb ... so maybe it really is a black / white thing ... just kidding but it 's kinda ironic ` cos people from mahgreb are of the darkest complexion ( at least compared to those from the midle-east/caucas/se-europe ), 
  nope , they started in mali and burnt their documents . 
  but they were definitively talking french with a strong bambara accent . 
   use the same tactics we use against russia what , strong public condemnation ? 
   you happen to have an uninhabited island lying around that is also large enough ... ? 
  \u2713 uninhabited \u2713 large enough compiling query ... [ skjoldungen island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skjoldungen ) seems nice . 
  the rest of it ( security , facilities ) can be built . 
  nope , we have no suffix or - ul ( definite article ) for masculine , e.g. 
  : ( masculine ) : * rom . 
  * a cretin / the cretin and for feminine we add usually a voel ( e.g. 
  \u0103 - pronounced '' \u0259 '' approximately like the last sound in the word idea ) : ( feminine ) : * rom . 
  * a cretin / the cretin, 
  the word exists in english too , both with a medical meaning and a pejorative one . 
  in romanian `` cretino '' is the feminine form in vocative case ( e.g. 
  when you shout/call a female `` you idiot ! '' . ), 
  i think he was serious . 
  maybe brainwashed , but serious . 
  i hate those - they are damn hard to remove without leaving marks . 
  in bulgaria you have to attach them on the windshield ( or else ... ) and that 's not nice if wan na spend a few holidays there . 
  in romania the road tax vignette is electronic-only , you can pay it in any gas station ( they check it with anpr in a database ) and is valid retroactively for the same day ( so even if you forget or ca n't find a place to pay for it nearby , you still have time till 23:59 ) . 
  coolest metal band from wales : skindred ninja : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luc3n7brnmo kill the power : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsfnygzslnk nobody : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsqhuxpssje, 
  thanks , but i do n't like this kind of vocals , actually not at all . 
  i prefer heavy/nu/alt - metal with cleaner vocals such as godsmack , metallica ( and also not the high pitch kind which remind me of glam metal era ) . 
  talking about high pitch glam rock vocals - romanian `` rockers '' will down-vote for this supreme sacrilege but i have to say i even dislike iris , the iconic romanian band , and especially i dislike their lead singer 's voice ( who i do n't really recall his name ) . 
  it 's not lack of musical culture , it 's just a difference in taste  you can hear them here ( iris ) in a collab with uriah heep : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7sb3j3cs8s, 
  about implant pentru refuz  sidef sounds very much like nu-metal , maybe that 's why i liked this song  i know what hardcore is ( but i 'm more the grunge type ) . 
  i just quoted their genre from [ wikipedia ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/implant_pentru_refuz ) ( romanian article ) assuming it 's correct and without thinking too much - after all same band can sing multiple genres throughout time or even in the same album . 
  now i see the wiki article says they ate metal/progressive in the rightmost infobox  !? 
  another band i kinda liked ( now disbanded , they were quite criticized for being a linkin park copycat band ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh-f0uuioli ( i like this song and also the one playing auto next ) . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i 'm a romanian and i 've never seen the danube delta . 
  every summer i think i should do that ... sometimes ... and that there 's still time . 
  where have you stayed ? 
  was the accommodation satisfactory ? 
  `` metal '' is not very popular in romania ( the number of bands per capita shows this quite clearly ) . 
  i like this band , *** implant pentru refuz *** ( actually they are classified as `` hardcore '' - is that even metal ? 
  ) : `` apus '' ( acoustic live video ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y7hdaj53ls `` sidef '' - music video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgfpfjfor0 `` apus '' - live on balconytv : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f23ekpoho9i, 
  running away from [ burebista ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burebista#caesar.27s_civil_war ) . 
  edit : thanks for downvoting me just for pointing the obvious and for asking a very legit question . 
  came back after one day , results still not published on either of the official or unofficial sites . 
  question stays valid . 
  any other source for that ? 
  the results for the 2017 edition have n't been published yet : http://www.ipho2017.id/ http://ipho.org/index.html http://ipho-unofficial.org/timeline/2017/country,
