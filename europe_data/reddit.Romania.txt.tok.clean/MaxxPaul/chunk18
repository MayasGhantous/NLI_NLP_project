  what makes you think a `` superordinate '' must necessarily exist ? 
  there is already a universal hierarchy in place , which does n't give a sh * t about us mortals , and thats that 's in the laws of physics : from sub-atomic to galactic levels , there is always something larger or smaller . 
  i do n't think there is an inherent requirement or need for something superordinate to exists , other than the universe itself . 
   if you were to be perfectly rational , with nothing above you , you are destined to become some kind of hedonistic nihilist , and that 's not a happy life . 
  this is some irrational statement and really based on personal misconceptions and wrong assumptions . 
  why would i need to have `` something above me '' in order to avoid being a hedonist or a nihilist ? 
  i think one can live a perfectly happy life without being a hedonist , and without needing to have something above . 
  i do n't need a god to give a reason to my life . 
  there are plenty of atheists who live good , happy and productive lives . 
  why not , ca n't they ask them before trying to make it home ? 
  in fact , it is relevant to know if they ** feel ** safe ( that is , in advance ) , and not if they * felt * safe retrospectively . 
  i was replying to the '' ** something always will replace religion ** '' thing - i mean , i do n't think this is really true for everyone . 
  and by the way , religion/gods/supranatural are all within the same category ( and contrast to naturalism/physicalism/realism ) . 
  they might be very different for your , but for someone who does n't believe in god , they 're pretty much the same . 
  ( in the same movie , there 's a funny comparison between god , santa claus and tooth fairy ) . 
  i do n't know if you listened to the dialogue in the scene i linked earlier , the girl says yeah well , the universe is great and all , but she would n't be able to just `` believe '' in the unvierse , without knowing `` somebody '' is there to `` talk to '' . 
  and the guy ( sorry i do n't recall the characters ' names ) says : - that 's what i thought , see ? 
  you do n't want a spiritual life based on truth . 
  you want a daddy in the sky , and even if he is totally imaginary , he 's always gon na be there when you need him . 
  that was what i referring to - only if one really wants/needs to fool him/her-self he/she would insist inventing things to believe in . 
  the ledge ( 2011 ) has aired just last evening in my area and this scene was interesting ( the scene when they lay on the roof and stargaze ) . 
  listen to the male character : https://youtu.be/ldxp1fhxera?t=111 i do n't belive in gods/mysticism/supranatural etc. 
  i think the universe is just there , with its rules ( laws of physics ) , life is just there/here , did n't need to be created for it to exists . 
  i do n't have `` someone '' higher to believe in , and that 's that ... 
  it might be harder for me when i live tough times , but that 's just the reality and i 'm not gon na `` invent '' someone to believe in - i just ca n't fool myself into this ... 
   even though suspects are in the picture , formal charges have not been brought yet . 
  it is highly questionable whether suspects will actually make appearances in court . 
  russian and ukrainian constitutions do not allow the extradition of subjects . 
  were there indeed any suspects identified ? 
  my sincere admiration for the czechs .

  nah , best potassium is from here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potaissa_ ( castra ), 
  if the growth values remain constant , romania would catch czechia in about 25 years and poland in 16 years , in gdp per capita , nominal ( for ppp , even faster ) . 
  of course , this is just a mind game ( based on unchanged growth ) . 
  romania | 10081 | 5,4 % poland | 15049 | 2,8 % czechia | 21707 | 2,3 % for calculating catch up time i 'll use the nominal gdp per capita , not the ppp one ( because we assume the prices and purchasing parity would change when nominal gdp will change ) . 
  we need to convert the growth percentage from difference ( +5,4 % ) to absolute factor ( e.g. 
  after n years of constant growth , a country would have a nominal gdp per capita equal to initial value times yearly growth factor at a power of n , something like gdp ( n ) = gdpinitial x ( growth-factor ) ^ n that is , for romania and czechia : 10081 * ( 1,054 ) ^ n = 21707 * ( 1,023 ) ^ n this leads to the simple exponential equation : 0,4644 = ( 0,970588 ) ^ n which can be solved using logarithms - e.g. 
  https://www.symbolab.com/solver/exponential-equation-calculator/%5cleft ( 0.970588 % 5cright ) % 5e % 7bx % 7d % 3d0 .4644 so , in n = 25,69 years , romania will have the same nominal gdp per capita as czechia ( that is , if the yearly growth for both is constant ) . 
  for romania and poland : 10081 * ( 1,054 ) ^ n = 15049 * ( 1,028 ) ^ n 0,669878 = 0,975332 ^ n n = 16 years second equation solved here : https://www.symbolab.com/solver/exponential-equation-calculator/%5cleft ( 0.975332 % 5cright ) % 5e % 7bx % 7d % 3d0 .669878,

   fermin muguruza nope but i know about garbi\u00f1e muguruza . 
  specex has been recovering its rockets ( 1st stage ) since 2015 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spacex#reusable_launch_system credits should go to spacex - they took the space launch market by storm with innovative designs and low prices . 
  and this pressure on the prices can only bring benefits for space research and exploration via increase availability and economy of scale . 
  i thought the spanish word would be `` muguruza '' , to match romanian 's `` bububurza '' . 
  mildly disappointed . 
  it seems there are three synonyms in romanian : [ m\u0103riu\u021b\u0103 ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=m%c4%83riu%c8%9b%c4%83+insect%c4%83&amp;num=20&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj83eyprnpuahvc1hqkhzi_ctoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=672 ) ( which means `` little mary '' , quilte uncommonly used for the insect ) [ m\u0103m\u0103ru\u021b\u0103 ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=m%c4%83m%c4%83ru%c8%9b%c4%83&amp;num=20&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiz3kvpq9puahvfarqkhdrmahoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=672 ) and [ g\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103 ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?biw=1366&amp;bih=672&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=g%c4%83rg%c4%83ri%c8%9b%c4%83&amp;oq=g%c4%83rg%c4%83ri%c8%9b%c4%83&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1.25491.29429.0.29783.11.10.1.0.0.0.121.793.8j1.9.0....0...1.1.64.img..1.9.720...35i39k1.42jugxodkcg ) ( actually a different insect , sometimes used for ladybug too ),

  most/many of the latest attacks 's perpetrators were radicalised muslims who were already living in europe . 
  most of them were poorly integrated and/or unhappy with their life/economical situation . 
  some were even born here , and i think some even had their parents born in europe . 
  i wonder out of these over 2 million `` newcomers '' in germany , how many could become radicalised in a few years , and how many of their descendants might become radicalised in the next 1-2 generations , if they ca n't make a decent living or they feel they ca n't integrate with the existing population . 
  they would have to pass ukraine 's territory for that ... 
   first tests have begun [ something like this ] ( https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/expanse/images/b/b4/160202_northfront_ext_donnager_anubis_battle_01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170412144404 ), 
  well , sadly enuf , the term `` romanian treasure '' appears to have quite a different origin / s  during world war i , since bucharest was occupied by germany , the romanian administration moved to ia\u015fi , and with them , the most valuable objects which belonged to the romanian state . 
  fearing an eventual german victory , the romanian government decided to send the treasure abroad . 
   among the ideas considered was to send it for safekeeping to the vaults of the bank of england or even to send it to the united states , but there was the problem of transportation , since germany and its allies controlled most of central europe and sending it via northern europe was dangerous , as the germans could have intercepted it . 
   the decision had to be taken by the romanian prime minister ion i. c. br\u0103tianu . 
  although the banker mauriciu blank advised him to send it to london or to a neutral country , such as denmark , br\u0103tianu feared the german submarines of the north sea and chose another ally of romania in world war i , russia , using the argument that `` russia would feel offended if we sent it to england '' . 
   the romanian government signed a deal with the russian government which stated that russia would safe keep the romanian treasure in the kremlin until the end of the war . 
   at 3:00 am during the night of december 14 -- 15 , 1916 , a train with 21 carriages , full of gold bars and gold coins ( around 120 tonnes ) , departed the ia\u015fi train station eastward . 
  in four other carriages , two hundred gendarmes guarded the train . 
  the gold load of this train has as of 2005 a value of $ 1.25 billion . 
   seven months later , in the summer of 1917 , as the war situation was getting worse for romania , another transport was sent to moscow , containing the most precious objects of the romanian state , including the archives of the romanian academy , many antique valuables , such as 3,500-year-old golden jewels found in romania , ancient dacian jewels , the jewels of the voivodes of wallachia and moldavia , as well as the jewels of the romanian royalty , thousands of paintings , as well as precious cult objects owned by romanian monasteries , such as 14th century icons and old romanian manuscripts . 
  it also contained various deposits of the romanian people at the national banks . 
  the value of this train is hard to estimate , especially because most of its contents are art objects , but most likely nowadays it could even surpass the value of the other train . 
   soviet russia and soviet union  after the romanian army entered bessarabia , at the time nominally part of russia , in early 1918 , the new soviet government severed all diplomatic relations and confiscated the romanian treasure . 
  the romanian government tried to recover the treasure in 1922 , but with little success . 
  in 1935 , the ussr did return a part of the archives , and in 1956 paintings and ancient objects , most notably , the pietroasele treasure . 
   all the governments of romania since world war i , regardless of their political colour , have tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a return of the gold and of the culturally valuable objects , but all soviet and russian governments have refused . 
  the soviet union tried to use the treasure in the dispute over bessarabia , however no agreement was reached . 
  *** but at least we learned the lesson - do not fight the germans and do not trust the russians : ***  during world war ii , the valuables of the national bank of romania were not taken outside of romania , but hidden inside a cave near tismana , gorj county and from there , they were safely recovered after the war . 
  romania would have about 11.2 grams per capita , if we would ' t have trusted the russians back in 1916 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure 120 tonns ( 120 * 10 ^ 6 grams ) divided by romania 's population ( 19.83 * 10 ^ 6 ) equals a little over 6 additional grams per capita,

  very bad for '' * us * '' or for us ? 
  commonly would mean the language of `` everyday use '' . 
  * `` speaks as a second language '' * does not mean `` commonly spoken '' . 
  i know english as a second language and that does n't mean i *** commonly speak english *** . 
  just as i wrote in the previous reply , more people know english than german , french etc. . . but i do n't think that makes english the most *** commonly *** spoken language in ue . 
  most spread as a 2nd language , most known , maybe , that 's very likely . 
  but not *** most commonly spoken *** . 
   even excluding uk , ireland and malta , english is still the most commonly spoken language in eu ummm . 
  not the `` most commonly spoken language in eu '' . 
  maybe the most commonly spoken 2nd language . 
  in eu there are about 82 + 66 million german and french people , that most certainly do not * commonly * speak english . 
  edit : i see the down-votes and it seems some do not really grasp the meaning of `` commonly '' and `` spoken '' . 
  of course english is the most spoken/best known *** 2nd language *** ( as a foreign language ) in eu , it might even be the language *** known *** by most people to some degree ( if you count all those who know some english as a 2nd language ) but get real people !, 
  - it 's not the *** most commonly spoken language in eu *** , is it ? 
  especially if not counting uk , ireland and malta .
