  romania can into nordics !, 
  romania safe and sound !, 
   when all of our taxes go to bucharest and only a small percent comes back yeah bucharest can join the eurozone already . 
  what you say makes no sense , because gdp is not about taxes , but about products and services sold . 
  and gdp per capita is a measure of the productivity of the workforce ( of the people in an area ) . 
  but if you complain about the spending of the taxes from the national ( state ) budget to individual areas , you are ** very ** wrong . 
  in this [ map ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qt98d ) , the regions with less than 100 % are net contributors , while the regions with more than 100 % are net beneficiaries to the/of the state budget . 
  bucharest and ilfov area are by far the strongest net contributors , receiving back only 11 % , respectivelly 15 % from what they pay to the state budget ( 2011 data ) . 
  other more recent sources show the [ same ] ( https://republica.ro/draga-attila-hai-sa-ti-zica-mitica-de-ce-taxele-tale-nu-imbogatesc-bucurestiul-capitala-da-grosul-la-buget ) - for bucharest , only 15-20 % of the amount paid to the state budget return there ( are spent back for/in bucharest ) . 
  there are a few other net contributor areas ( including prajova , brasov , cluj etc. ), 
  but then there are also the regions in n-e and south , that receive more than they pay to the national budget . 
  bucharest is the largest contributor to the state budget ( having the largest gdp it also pays most of the taxes - it pays over 17 % of the state budget if you do n't count the `` large contributors '' and over 60 % if you include them - see [ here ] ( http://www.economica.net/harta-judetelor_80453.html ) ) if you want to be picky you could point that commuters ( who live in neighbouring regions but work in bucharest ) increase the gdp of bucharest without really living there - and that might be true , but it 's valid for all big cities . 
  holding the middle button ( mouse wheel ) - at least in chrome - enables scrolling of the whole page , but the displayed zoomed map area stays the same , wo n't pan/scroll either left-right or up-down . 
  romania -  bucharest - ** 39600 ** $ `` per abitante '' that is , if your screen is big enough and you have a lot of mouse dpi . 
  why on earth a map would feature zoom , but not panning ? 
  the zoom is centrered on the map , not on the pointer location , so it 's useless to see an area not in the center of the map . 
  the point is that those in bulgaria are really in the basement ( of the apartment building , i suppose ) .

  they must install a photo camera there , during the summer days :d i think these stores must be run by dwarfs :d, 
   they for sure fish illegal here in bavaria and that 's kinda stealing . 
  compare to this : http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/whales/which-countries-are-still-whaling imo also kinda stealing ... big scale . 
  a new ( actually ak-based ) , locally manufactured 5.56 x45mm assault rifle is being prepared for quite some times ( pa model 2000 ) . 
  but the standard service rifle is still the old `` pa model 1986 '' . 
  there are 5.56 x45 rifles in use by special forces : https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/list%c4%83_de_echipamente_ale_armatei_rom%c3%a2ne#armament_de_infanterie for the new rifle , they already have the bullets : http://romarm.ro/product/cal-556-x-45-mm-cartridges-ball-bullet-ss-109/  as for the side arm , they are working on an improved transphase eradication rod . 
  in romanian we have three words for snow , and two words for walls , they all get [ translated ] ( https://translate.google.com/#ro/en/pere%c8%9bii%20%c8%99i%20zidurile%20ap%c4%83r%c4%83%20casa%20de%20nea%2c%20om%c4%83t%20%c8%99i%20z%c4%83pad%c4%83 . ), 
  to the same word ( respectively ) in english . 
  i find this funny , but i am sure plenty of examples could be found the other way . 
  uk will need a really big yellow submarine , ` cos this 'll happen again . 
  of course , in the end all words ( or most of them ) in use in europe should be traceable back to proto-indoeuropean ( sanskrit is an indoeuropean language too ) . 
  i just find it hard to conceive the concept of etymology for a loanword that entered a language in an unmodified form ( i thought etymology needs a change in the linguistic form ) . 
  how does one define etymology - if a ( loan - ) word enters a language and starts being used unmodified ( like `` servus '' ) do you get a new , `` german '' word ? 
  or it 's just a latin word in use , in a different language or area ? 
  and then , if this word enters usage in a 2nd language , also unmodified , would you say it 's etymology is german , or rather the original one ( latin ) ? 
  if a romanian says from time to time `` wtf '' or thanks or voila , or vis-a-vis , does this make these words romanian ? 
  then , if romania conquers russia ( for the sake of example , not that we want to do that ) and these words are used there , would they have a romanian etymology ? 
  compare https://dexonline.ro/definitie/sandvi\u0219 to https://dexonline.ro/definitie/whisky first one ( sandvi\u0219 / sandvici ) is a romanian word because the linguistic form developed , changed when transmitted from english `` sandwich '' . 
  so we can talk about it having an etymology and indeed one is listed ( * `` din fr. , engl . 
  sandwich . 
  '' * ) but what about whisky ? 
  is it a romanian word , or an english or irish word in use in romanian ? 
  the link above indicates two etymologies `` word in english language '' or `` irish word '' my point was that - in my humble and non-professional opinion - even if servus was used in central-eastern europe , it never became a german word . 
  it 's like one romanian youngster says to you `` thanks omule '', 
  maybe that was the source of ezglot as well , but i doubt it is correct . 
  how could `` anonim '' have a latin etymology as listed also on dexonline , and anonimity have a german one , if it 's derived with a romanian nominalizing suffix from a latin loan word ... ( rethorical question ) . 
  yeah , and my grandma in north-western transylvania was shooing the cats out of the kitchen and from the vicinity of the sour milk pot with the word `` katz ! '', 
  ( it 's true , i 'm not joking ) . 
  and that 's indeed from german language ( via austro-hungarian empire , actually ) . 
  but ** servus ** is a very bad example ( and you practically offered the argument for that ) , because it has a ** latin ** etymology and it was used traditionally throughout the austro-hungarian empire , so it 's not `` a loan from germans '' - it 's a loan from austrians or hungarians and it 's not even a german word , but a latin one . . 
  anyway , i did n't say we did n't import words from german , but only that the list on http://www.ezglot.com/etymologies.php is b/s judging by the first word ( anonimity ) . 
  even if by chance the word would have entered in romanian use through contact with german-speaking people , its *** etymology *** is still not german . 
  and it 's not derived from german anonymit\u00e4t , but from latin anonymus . 
  it 's like saying that anonimity in english is derived from german . 
  and the latin word in fact is a loan from greek : *** an\u014dnumos *** = ` nameless ' ( from *** an - *** ` without ' + *** onoma *** ` name ' ) . 
   romanian did import some words from german i wo n't argue that , but a first look at the 1st word in the list made me think it 's bulls * it . 
  anonimitate from anonymit\u00e4t ? 
  its from latin [ `` anonimus '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anonymus ) derived by [ morphological derivation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morphological_derivation ) with the '' - tate '' , the most common [ nominalizing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nominalization ) suffix . 
  like naiv - naivitate , complice - complicitate etc.

   it seems kind of hard to believe actually , even in 2014 , regional gdp per capita at ppp of bucharest was higher than those of warsaw , budapest , athens , lisbon , madrid , rome and ... *** berlin *** - yeah , but it 's *** regional *** . 
  while the country still lacks behind , the capital city 's gdp/capita is that high . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gdp_at_regional_level ) and [ charts ] ( http://imgur.com/a/7vagp ) - in % 's of eu average . 
  also , as far as i recently read , berlin is the ** only ** eu capital having a ** lower ** gdp/capita ppp than than its country average . 
   are actually interested in upgrading our infrastructure i think the bucharest-danube channel issue in firea 's discourse is just another example of populist and demagogic propaganda , aimed at the communist-era nostalgics . 
  everybody knows there are quite a few old people who think `` ceausescu was not that bad , at least he built something and almost everybody had jobs '' . 
  she 's just capitalizing on that . 
  or else , let 's talk again about this in about 30 years , when a new feasibility study will be auctioned in a public tender , or - in a `` best '' case scenario - the officials will inform the public about yet another few months delay of the project , pushing the deadline from the initial 10 years to ... e.g. 
  25 years ... 
  almost every legislative project of their parliamentary group , every ordinance of the psd government and every decision of the local councils seem to be aimed to winning or keeping voters and increasing psd 's chances in future elections , by any means , on the expense on common sense ( when they just blatantly lie ) and future generation 's welfare ( when the borrow money for their fantasy-populist projects ) . 
  no offense , but it 's a little too easy to admit a crime , after the perpetrators are long gone ( as in dead and buried ) . 
  so who 's gon na pay for such crime ?

  boii , our old neighbours  the dacian kingdom was neighbouring the boii across the tatra mountains , in bohemia . 
  * more celts arrived during the bc 3rd century , and in bc 1st century the people of boii tried to conquer some of the dacian territory on the eastern side of the teiss river . 
  the dacians drove the boii south across the danube and out of their territory , at which point the boii abandoned any further plans for invasion .

  as soon as i posted this , i got a message it was deleted . 
  ( oth now i no longer see the deleted tag ... so is it on ? ), 
  in romanian , `` limba '' means language . 
  so if for romania we keep the `` limba '' in the language designation we should also have deutsche sprache , langue fran\u00e7aise and so on ... 
  not until we find the end of pi . 
  while there still are irrational numbers , philosophers , mathematicians and physicist agree these numbers are valid proof that we are not living a simulated reality . 
  but if you find the last digit of pi , then you are living in the matrix . 
  yeah but think of this - a lot of cultures had their highs and lows , from golden ages to complete decadence or being assimilated . 
  what is iraq now , and they had on their territory the largest cities in their times ( uruk , alkkad , sumer , nineveh , babylon ) . 
  someone on this thread was longing for the armenian kingdom , we ( romanians ) dream about dacia ( what if decebal did n't attack rome - might dacia have resisted as an independent country ? ) ... 
  at least portugal had a colonial empire  even if speaking a romance language .
