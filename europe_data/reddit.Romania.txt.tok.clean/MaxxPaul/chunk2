  hey , i just could n't help myself from pointing that . 
  maybe it was n't nice of me and i know i 'm not perfect either , 
  ooops , sorry , i missed / somehow overlooked the part about him being the mayor right there in the title , i thought he was only the leader of the center party !, 
  i did know tallinn is your capital !, 
  that 's quite a coincidence then because our capital mayor is not only suspected , but under trial !, 
  hey but if i keep bragging about this , we have the prime minister under trial now , too and a former one that was convicted already !, 
  it 's not a contest , i know , 
  happy independence day from a neighbor to the north !, 
  i was curious about bulgaria 's independence and i found out that romania and bulgaria got their independence pretty much following the same war ( but at different moment of times ) . 
  do n't judge me , i did n't like history in school  then i found this : http://www.bulgariainside.eu/en/articles/romanian-mausoleum,-grivitsa/942/index.html do bulgarians visit it ? 
  is this worth visiting ? 
  because they get even more corrupt after being elected ( if this word accepts comparatives ) . 
  being elected is the way to getting even more illegal advantages . 
  well at least he was not the mayor of the capital city , was he ? 
  we got our mayor in bucharest caught with bribe marked money in his possession , now he is under arrest and will be trialed . 
  i 've been working with german partners for 14 years ( doing import-export ) and i can tell they are n't representative anymore for the `` correct as a german '' label that i was used to . 
  increased commercial activities with the balkans after '89 somehow balkanized them in a way . 
  siemens among others is known to have been involved in various corruption ( including bribery ) scandals in east/central europe or elsewhere ( e.g. 
  africa ) . 
  so cheating in some technical document is like piece of cake . 
  it seems we are so contagious than even american companies are not immune ( e.g. 
  its programs or their, 
  definitelly !, 
  then maybe , just maybe , we can get our 2700 ( as of 2012 ) `` uneducated '' doctors back !, 
  i guess you did n't know that most foreign doctors in germany are from eastern europe and especially romania . 
  zeit.de ( in german ) : http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2014-01/infografik-aerzte-ausland chart : http://images.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2014-01/aertzte/aertzte-540x304.jpg english : http://www.antena3.ro/en/world/romanian-doctors-go-to-work-abroad-most-of-the-foreign-doctors-professing-in-germany-come-from-240068.html http://www.mededworld.org/news/news-articles/germany-romanian-immigrants-in-a-white-coat.aspx but wait , they might go to france instead , where they make were making more than 12 % of the foreign doctors ( as of 2010 ) and more than 17 % in 2013 : http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/where-did-all-the-romanian-doctors-and-french-med-students-go.html http://www.ibtimes.com/est-il-un-medecin-dans-la-maison-number-foreign-doctors-france-surged-43-2008-1293229, 
  that reminds me of those saying that the romanian provinces would be different countries ( and that romania would be an artificial construct lol ) ... 
  while hunyadis `` of hungary '' came from wallachia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunyadi_family#notable_members vlad the impaler , king/prince of wallachia , was actually born in sighisoara/transylvania . 
   edit : i 'd also like to point out that his son , king mathias , was also one of the biggest enemies of vlad tepes , now considered a national hero of romania . 
  mathias actually kept him imprisoned in his dungeon for years at one point . 
  that 's how they were solving family problems in those times  during those years vlad married mathias ' cousin : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilona_szil%c3%a1gyi anyway , they were not really enemies , since initially they were allied against the ottomans , but mathias was a backstabber sob after all , changed his alliance and betrayed vlad : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlad_the_impaler#second_and_main_reign_.281456-62.29, 
  well some guys in sweden beg to differ : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl7ju42u0wo wtf ? 
  0-100 k/h in 3.0 seconds ( using a v6 engine ), 
  damn this as a whole and the comments are so funny that i 've lost 30 minutes of my planned planetside 2 gaming time here . 
  or was it a loss really ? 
   thank you all for being such funny, 
  wait !, 
  wait !, 
  in my son 's school we got no teddy bear !, 
  instead , a representative of the mayor office came . 
  i feel so cheated !, 
  so this year we had : - a representative of the sectorial mayor ( or the deputy-mayor - who cares ) - that is because the mayor of our `` sector '' ( in bucharest ) was himself visiting a `` better '' school ( and the mayor of bucharest is in jail , as you might know , but he would n't have come in our school anyway , there are better ones ) - a priest ; his speech was the most boring one - a former director who retired 10 years ago - the current director and the deputy director so no teddy bear for us . 
  i am angry now . 
  oh , and i must add this : do n't pray in my school and i wo n't think in your church . 
  edit : i forgot the line breaks . 
  well they ca n't withhold eu funds from switzerland can they ? 
  is switzerland part of eu ? 
  al-qaeda was n't more lethal than a plane crash either , in the states . 
  that is , before 9/11 . 
  and they were not beheading americans . 
  you ca n't seriously argue that since isis has n't been lethal in europe ( yet ) we should n't be concerned about the danger . 
  the tip of the iceberg . 
  it 's only the beginning . 
  raed arafat attended a medical unviersity in romania . 
  that 's why he is so good at what he does , 
  yeah , moldova has less gypsies and more blonde people . 
  and you got o-zone and originated numa-numa too :d, 
  from a satire news website ( timesnewroman ) - not real fact but still funny : liechtenstein , completely flooded because an inhabitant wanted to do the ice bucket challenge ... 
  the bottom of this ( no pun intended ) : it 's not the `` two '' word that unites us all ( in europe ) . 
  it 's the shit  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_profanity#cac.c4.81re:_to_defecate, 
   poop caca means `` poop '' in romanian too ... 
  it seems sh . . t trancends language barriers after all , and does n't give a. . . well ... yes ... a sh . . t on all this indo-european and finno-ugric language differences . 
  why not ? 
  they were saying they do n't want to stay/go to hungary/bulgaria/greece because it 's too cold there . 
   swift identification and return of persons who do not abide by such agreement is already possible under the eu law haha !, 
  good one - already possible , but is it really being done ? 
  so the commission says the eu countries need to build a chain of prisons , actually , for resettling migrants ... 
  wow that 's a lot of countries !, 
  some very good geography there !, 
  so , is it better to be `` a country '' ( e.g. 
  switzerland , austria , moldova , latvia ) than a `` developing country '' ( hungary , romania , france ) ? 
  kinda mixed do n't you think ? 
  oh , and could you make up your mind about portugal , please ? 
  monarchy for romania is a very good idea but only if we get dracula as king . 
   but the eu mutual assistance clause requires eu members to aid finland . 
  i bet germany and france and all other eu countries will send a lot of tents , blankets and bottled water . 
  but i wonder will/would/could eu do more ? 
  so if russia attacks finland , russia attacks eu , right ? 
  and then russia will say to eu ... `` whatcha gon na do about this , punk '' ? 
  and ... what 's gon na eu do , anyway , if an eu country is attacked ? 
  makes me wonder ... 
  ha-ha !, 
   `` anti-semitism started world war ii , russophobia could start the third . 
  finland is one of the most russiphobian countries in europe , together with sweden and the baltic states , '' says russian president vladimir putin 's personal envoy sergei markov , interviewed by hufudstadsbladet this weekend . 
  what !? 
  - maybe they do n't like russians too much , but if you got ta name some `` russiphobian '' countries , how can you name sweden and forget ( in no particular order ) poland and romania ? 
  as a counter-challenge , i 'd be curious to see how an european is able to draw usa and all the states in their proper places . 
  spoiler : la is somewhere west and florida is south-east ... 
  i think . 
  well , we wo n't have our famed female gymnastics team in the olympics either - i think this happens for the first time in decades .

  it is true , also i remember learning in biology ( in the university i mean ) that historically sicily had a higher sickle cell rate for the same reason . 
  the gene `` survives '' in the collective genome of a population , in a certain geographical area , because it offers an evolution advantage during the malaria outbreaks . 
  that makes me think that if malaria has been eradicated from europe , on the long term more and more europeans will `` loose '' the gene for sickle cell anemia ( and this would be quite bad if we would n't have good healthcare , but otherwise i think it 's good ) . 
  it 's like antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria - they hinder the bacteria 's metabolism ( forcing the cell to `` manufacture '' anti-antibiotic enzymes or other normally unneeded metabolites ) but when the antibiotic treatment is present , then these gens are helpful . 
  so in a bacterial population there is a balance between those bearing the antibiotic resistance gene ( s ) and those which do n't , their ratio varying depending on the environment ( e.g. 
  the presence of the antibiotic ) . 
  malaria has a interesting connection/interaction with [ sickle-cell anaemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sickle-cell_disease ) . 
  the red blood cells have a different shape which causes problems , but on the other hand makes the bearer almost immune to malaria . 
  when there were malaria outbreaks in the mediterranean area , those bearing this disease ( and gene ) had a higher survival rate .
