  so we have vandals , avars , venetics ... all kinda pejorative words and all kinda names of `` barbaric '' tribes . 
  there must be something to it  no offence meant for the present-day people that could be those tribes ' descendants . 
  obviously the culture and civilisation of people change and evolve . 
  it 's more or less dalmatia , but you are right . 
  i did n't make the map ( unfortunately also i can not cite the source , i found it on multiple internet sites ) . 
  the map is from 50 bc ( bce ) and according to wikipedia , there should exist an illyricum province [ - that existed from 27 bc to sometime during the reign of vespasian ( 69-79 ad ) . 
  the province comprised illyria/dalmatia and pannonia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illyricum_ ( roman_province ) ) also there was the prefecture of illyricum according to a different wikipedia [ page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illyria ) : * the romans defeated gentius , the last king of illyria , at scodra ( in present-day albania ) in 168 bc and captured him , bringing him to rome in 165 bc . 
  four client-republics were set up , which were in fact ruled by rome . 
  later , the region was directly governed by rome and organized as a province , with scodra as its capital . 
  * * the romans defeated gentius , the last king of illyria , at scodra ( in present-day albania ) in 168 bc and captured him , bringing him to rome in 165 bc . 
  four client-republics were set up , which were in fact ruled by rome . 
  later , the region was directly governed by rome and organized as a province , with scodra as its capital . 
  * * the roman province of illyricum replaced the formerly independent kingdom of illyria . 
  it stretched from the drilon river in modern albania to istria ( croatia ) in the west and to the sava river ( bosnia & herzegovina ) in the north . 
  salona ( near modern split in croatia ) functioned as its capital . 
  * * after crushing a revolt of pannonians and daesitiates , roman administrators dissolved the province of illyricum and divided its lands between the new provinces of pannonia in the north and dalmatia in the south . 
  although this division occurred in 10 ad , the term illyria remained in use in late latin and throughout the medieval period . 
  * according to the last paragraph , if the division took place in 10ad , there should still be an illyricum province earlier thant this . 
  funny , on the same wikipedia page there 's a map labelled [ `` 375-379 ad '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/prefecture_of_illyricum_map.png ) apparently contradicting both pages quited above . 
  yeah , i reached the same conclusion after some more search . 
  it 's ... interesting how ... interesting history seems after so many years of not being ... interested by history  al those years of chemistry really pay off :d, 
   is n't that related to venice and venitian merchants ? 
  i did n't exclude that possibility . 
  as i wrote ,  unless the term appeared referring to traders from venice . 
  likewise for avars - in romania * avar * means stingy/cheap and i was wondering if it was borrowed from the avar people name ... but it might in fact come from latin * avarus * . 
  yet , on the other hand , the name for the avars ( people ) in latin was also * avarus * o_o, 
   wends yeah , venedae , veneti ( of the vistula area ) and wends are [ the same thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wends#roman-era_veneti ) . 
  also [ venedae ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=venedae&amp;redirect=no ) redirects on wikipedia to west slaves so i guess that 's indeed so . 
  edit : the listed possible etymologies for venetic with the meaning foreigner in romania are : czech ven\u00e1tky , greek venetikos , turkish venedik , albanian venetik , slavic venedik\u016d ... but i have no ideea if the meaning is really the same in those languages . 
  in romanian venetic also means a kind of currency from venice . 
  without being a linguist ( or sometimes even if being one ) it 's easy to fell into the trap of fake etymologies for words that sounds similar . 
  i have no proof the venetic ( foreigner ) in romania should be derived from the wends/venedae ; it could very well be derived from venice - since even in latin , veneti name was given to quite a few different peoples ( two or three if i 'm not mistaken ) . 
  well without austrian empire there would have been no austro-hungarian one and no vienna congress , i guess . 
  but i guess a more correct phrasing was `` the austrian empire should not have existed in the first place ''  - of course , this my personal view . 
  it 's true , who would n't ? 
  except that the austrian ~ ~ austro-hungarian ~ ~ empire should have not existed in the first place , 
  maybe i was a bit too ironic , or touchy . 
  peace . 
  the point is that i came to realise the search for truth is still a ongoing ( never-ending ? ), 
  process in a lot of fields ( do n't get me into baryonic matter/dark matter/dark energy ) and unless someone says that the universe was created by the great invisible pink unicorn , you never know when a previously science fact thought to be true is invalidated by some new fact . 
  so when discussing the validity of some scientific fact , i always think it 's better to take it with a grain of salt . 
  science is a series of models , each one perfecting the previous one [ like the plum pudding modle of the atom - it was true , unitil proved wrong  ] . 
  of course , you were not addressing this issue , but the much too broad scope of the labels on the original map , and on this i agree with you ( but please do note i think the map is quite old , since it uses i1b instead of i2 , and also i was not the one who posted it , nor the one who labelled it and my wild guess of the population groups was just a game for me ), 
  hushhh ... they were n't suppose to see that !, 
  now you spoiled it . 
  the soil is great too  makes good crops  as for the people , i 'm afraid a lot of great ones left , or died . 
  but on the other hand , a lot of bad ones leave - so we might still have a chance , 
   many examples of language being transmitted between cultures while leaving only few genetic traces , and vice versa this is a very good point . 
  nothing wrong in what you say , but let 's not forget that all those features you mentioend are the perfect expression and proof of the current globalism . 
  we - world 's population - on the whole are a culture from a global/globalistic point of view , and in the same time consist of multiple discrete cultures , that could be called nations or ethnicities if you prefer . 
  not the same can be said about the ancient world - i suppose - where a large empire was maybe the maximum possible kind of `` globalism '' on a much smaller scale . 
  but when specifically referring to older , less organised people , only relations between groups i doubt could have brought the unitiy in workmanship techniques and language , unless they were a little more related than only by trade or warfare . 
  but since i 'm not a historian , that was just my understanding ( be it right or wrong ) - that celtic people really spoke a similar language ( originally ) , then when some of them started moving west , maybe their languages and habits diverged . 
  should we still consider them a culture or a people ? 
  i guess it 's a matter of perspective . 
  i 'm not sure why you got so unsettled or agitated ( hopefully , one of this could be the right word ) . 
  you must be the owner of the ultimate knowledge , and the real truth , do n't you , unlike the ignorant mortals that surround you . 
  but i do n't really see the point of your * inflammation * ( if that 's the correct english word ) , i clearly stated from the start that i was just guessing ; this is not my field of expertise ( neither genetics nor anthropology ) . 
  the labels are very broad in the map , and so were my guesses . 
  but then , again , if you asked , this is what i found about j2 ( and these , i hope , are more authoritative sources than the random wordpress blog you 've pointed ) : [ haplogroup j2 is thought to have appeared somewhere in the middle east towards the end of the last glaciation , between 15,000 and 22,000 years ago . 
  ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/haplogroup_j2_y-dna.shtml ) and [ it is likely that j2 men had settled over most of anatolia , the south caucasus and iran by the end of the last glaciation 12,000 years ago . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_j-m172 ) for me , middle east , south caucasus , anatolia and iran seem quite ... middle east ( or arabic ? 
  - i admitted history is not my filed either ) . 
  and regarding i1b : [ haplogroup i-m438 , also known as i2 ( and until 2007 as i1b ) , is a human dna y-chromosome haplogroup , a subclade of haplogroup i-m170 . 
  haplogroup i-m438 originated some time around 13,000 -- 15,000 bce and has two primary subclades : i-l460 and i-l1251 . 
  the haplogroup reaches its maximum frequency in the dinaric alps in the balkans , where the men are on record as being the tallest in the world , with a male average height of 185.6 cm ( 6 ft 1.1 in ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_i-m438 ) and [ regarding the old europeans , additional analysis of more than 1000 hg i y chromosomes from 60 population samples revealed several subclades in europe , with divergent geographic distributions ( 30 ) . 
  authors suggested that haplogroup i provided an excellent record of pre-lgm differentiation followed by geographic contraction , isolation , and subsequent post-lgm expansions and spreading . 
  occurrence of i1a in scandinavia is consistent with a post-lgm recolonization of northwestern europe from franco-cantabria . 
  the expansion of i1b * in the wider adriatic area suggested demographic processes that started from a refugium located in that region , whereas , i1c covers a considerable part of europe , with the highest frequencies in northwestern europe . 
  it is suggested that haplogroup i originated from a pre-lgm pool of europeans ( 28,000-23 000 years ago ) . 
  also , it appears that i1a , i1b , and i1c diverged from i * , possibly during the post-lgm recolonization of europe . 
  regarding the old europeans in this area , high short tandem repeat diversity within i1b * lineages in bosnia and herzegovina and croatia supports the view that the p37 short nucleotide polymorphism may have been present in the balkan area before the lgm . 
  this implies that the territories of these two countries were probably very attractive for `` summer vacation '' during the lgm . 
  ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3118711/ ) so again , i was n't so far from the truth , unless you know the true truth and my source are the wrong kind of truth . 
  i2 , aka i1b , originated  15.000 years ago in the balkan/dinaric area , which according to my poor history knowledge should be somewhere in europe ... 
  i 'd love to stay and chat more , but maybe you 'd find a better and more intellgient audience in the genetics subreddit , or the subreddit reserved for clever people ( if they do n't have one , you should start it ) . 
   romas and gypsies he meant romans and gypsies , but i suppose he was n't aware that the roman empire had collapsed a few weeks ago . 
  i am a life scientist who did n't study enough history in school , that 's where my curiosity comes from . 
  but even as diverse as you say , i see cultures as a language continuum . 
  because language as a mean of exchanging information implies contact and living/working together . 
  maybe i got your point wrong , but if the cultures were so disconnected as you propose , with different tribes not knowing / speaking to each other , the strange resemblances between words or idioms belonging to different peoples or `` branches '' of the same people become even more strange . 
  maybe is a terrible example , or completely in the wrong context , but i was astonsihed when i learn that the superstition and idiom of `` knocking on would '' or `` touching wood '' has such a wide presence - from britain to lebanon or even more . 
  that must meant that all those poeple were in contact . 
  and according to wikipedia , the origin of this superstition might have been in the germanic folklore ... 
  if the each of the `` cultures '' was so diverse so that would be improper to even call it a culture , how do we explain the language ? 
  in fact , what do they use to define a culture ? 
  language ( if known ) , pottery , weapons style ... and all these show being together , making a culture ? 
  or am i wrong ? 
  hibernia , the land of the winter ... , 
  i meant the scottish people . 
  but i understand your point ( according to wp : * the latin word scotti , originally the word referred specifically to the gaels , but came to describe all inhabitants of scotland * . 
  ... and ... * scoti or scotti was a name used by late roman authors for the irish . 
  scotland was named after irish settlers from the 5th century on . 
  * ) interesting stuff . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant by not being sure about the politically correctness of the term . 
  thank you !, 
  i take it as a compliment  in fact , i did a quick web search for the i1b haplogroup and those were some of the results , with the most probably correct one east mediteranean , but still some say proto-slav and/or `` old european '' . 
  [ edit  this just came into my head : ** gauls were a celtic people ** !,
