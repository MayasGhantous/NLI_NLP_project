  so the apparent `` separation '' between the british ones and the central-european one is only because the map shows the freshly-conquered gallia province in yellow . 
  i suppose all the celts must have been genetically and linguistically related , and originate din one place ( maybe iron age central europe ) but in those times people were less sedentary than we are , so they might have moved a lot throughout the ages . 
  also the population density was quite low , so that allowed settling different areas with less `` population pressure '' . 
  look at the bulgarians and serbians . 
  even if the slavs originated in north-east europe , they moved to the south and settled their current areas . 
  romania is a ** great ** country already !, 
  not sure about the inhabitants , 
  [ bronze age balto-slavic cultures ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/balto-slavic_lng.png ) ; also look at the haplogroups map posted by [ _ hopped _ ] ( / u / _ hopped _ ) it seems the ( proto - ) slaves were in the area , maybe a little more to the east . 
  see also : [ vistula veneti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_veneti ) - proposed proto-slav people . 
  i think on the map they are venedae . 
  curious fact : in romanian , [ venetic ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/venetic ) means `` people coming from somewhere else and considered foreign in the new place they settled '' . 
  i 'm not sure what relevance is to that . 
  maybe the proto-slavs moved westward and southward and they were called venetics in romania , unless the term appeared referring to traders from venice . 
  i finally decided my watch brands for the next decades !, 
  seiko and casio ftw !, 
  thanks switzerland !, 
  oh , i only saw the legend within the map , thank you  [ edit  i was quite close , 
  very interesting , too bad the haploid groups or what they 're called are not labelled in more detail . 
  my guess is : red = celtic yellow = slavic green = middle-east/arabic light green = germanic dark blue = old european/proto-slav/east mediteranean - quite [ controversial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_i-m438 ), 
  damn , and this is where my estonian language skills abruptly end  * in the modern estonian language , eesti is the endonym for `` estonia '' . 
  estonia was known as estia or hestia in some early latin sources , and eistland in ancient scandinavian sagas . 
  estonians themselves used maarahvas , meaning people of the land , to refer to themselves until the early modern era . 
  the etymologies of [ aesti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aesti#overview ) and eesti remain subjects of scholarly conjecture . 
  what i find funny ( not being a historian ) is how did the celts get separated ? 
  some on the british islands , and some in the central europe . 
  hmm ... must be the gauls . 
  and the germans . 
  it 's right there buddy - aestii  right beside `` popoli baltici '' . 
  you just missed scandinavia by a few km , 
  i meant the `` old scots ''  the ones to the north of hadrian 's wall . 
  they must had a name for the island they were living on . 
  that name must have been - obviously - in their language , right ? 
  ... and i think i found it !, 
  was it [ alba/albion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alba ) ? 
   great britain til that great britain does n't already include northern ireland and isle of man and actually is the current name of the `` larger '' island ( formerly known as britannia by the romans ) . 
  but what about the scots inhabiting it 's northern part , i wonder where they ok with the name britannia ? 
  in fact , that was an exonym , right ? 
  i wondered what was the endonym . 
  i bet ec and junker now want to express their sympathy and regrets for the visa issue . 
  so cute / s, 
  sorry , i wanted to add `` sans scandinavia and northern part of the * british * [ is that even a `` politically '' correct term in historical context ? ], 
  islands '' but the title was too long . 
  i 've only cropped the map a little to the south , the north was already missing from the original image . 
  and by the way , i 'm genuinely curious , what was the proper scottish term for the ~ ~ ( british ) ~ ~ [ great britain ] island ? 
  i see this was a [ disputed issue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute ) . 
  did scots accept the term * britannia * for the whole island , as named by the romans ? 
  [ edit  wikipedia does n't clarify it : following the conquest of ad 43 the roman province of britannia was established , [ 98 ] and roman britain expanded to cover much of the island of great britain . 
  an invasion of ireland was considered but never undertaken , and ireland remained outside the roman empire . 
  [ 99 ] the romans failed to consolidate their hold on the scottish highlands ; the northern extent of the area under their control ( defined by the antonine wall across central scotland ) stabilised at hadrian 's wall across the north of england by about ad 210 . 
  [ 100 ] inhabitants of the province continued to refer to themselves as `` brittannus '' or `` britto '' , and gave their patria ( homeland ) as `` britannia '' or as their tribe . 
  [ 101 ] the vernacular term `` priteni '' came to be used for the barbarians north of the antonine wall , with the romans using the tribal name `` caledonii '' more generally for these peoples who ( after ad 300 ) they called picts . 
  [ 102 ] the post-conquest romans used britannia or britannia magna ( large britain ) for britain and hibernia or britannia parva ( small britain ) for ireland . 
  the post-roman era saw brythonic kingdoms established in all areas of britain except the scottish highlands , but coming under increasing attacks from picts , scotti and anglo-saxons . 
  at this time ireland was dominated by the gaels or scotti , who subsequently gave their names to ireland and scotland . 
  you two , leave romania out if this ... and get a room , will you ? 
  '' * 1 % of those surveyed across the 11 other european countries identified that they would like their country to be more like ireland * '' - - so i find it only fair that 1 % of the irish people would want their country to be more like romania . 
  i call this solidarity , 
  the 2014 census held in `` core '' moldova ( without transnistria ) shows that 75,1 % of the population identify as `` moldovan '' and 7 % as `` romanian '' , totaling 82,1 % romanian and moldovan . 
  also , 78,6 / 80,2 % of the population declares romanian or moldovan as fist / native language ( by difference 82,1 % -80,2 % , there might be about 2 % of population that identify as moldovan and yet speak a different language , maybe gagauz and/or russian ) . 
  also , there are moldovans who declare themselves moldovan but use russian , maybe due to mixed families and/or russification . 
  and yet , the breakdown of the 78,6 % having romanian/moldovan as primary ( and most likely also native ) language shows that * [ 54.6 % of the population named moldovan whereas 24.0 % named romanian as their first language in daily use ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldova#languages ) * . 
  this is interesting , because most of the [ polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_romania_and_moldova#moldova ) held in moldova showed a similar 20 to 30 % of people agree to unification - most probably the same people who declare romanian as their language . 
  in the end , as ~ ~ metal gear solid v ~ ~ romanian philosopher emil cioran wrote * `` on n\u2019habite pas un pays , on habite une langue . 
  '' * ( `` one does not inhabit a country ; one inhabits a language . 
  that is our country , our fatherland - and no other . '', 
  - - or , according to mgsv translation , ** `` it is no nation we inhabit , but a language . 
  make no mistake ; our native tongue is our true fatherland . 
  you do n't have to down-vote him for stating the truth . 
  the polls show that a large number of the moldovans who speak romanian/moldovan , actually do not vote for joining romanian in the polls ( which puzzles me , but each to his own ) . 
  - that , or the polls are fake -, 
  sorry , i 'm not really an expert and - usually - traditional folk music is not my cup of tea . 
  sometimes i happen to like such a song , and many of them are from moldova . 
  i just listed a few , the post was already too long , 
  there 's a saying `` the romanian was born poet '' . 
  not sure about that , but i know moldovans were born musicians . 
  i bet this is a side of moldova many europeans do n't really know . 
  zdob & zdub is a ethno-rock band singing in romanian , english and/or russian : [ moldovenii s-au nascut / moldovans were born ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8_c2xsssmk ) , [ moldavian hardcore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycpgis6zybk ) , [ videli noch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp8gl7hwp3m ) , [ bunica bate toba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvhtwfc7rf4 ) mihail sandu ( born in russia to moldovan parents , spent childhood in moldova and moved to romania for university ) - ** i highly recommend you to listen ** : [ noi ne privim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qmepcka0om ) , [ simt ca ne-am indepartat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy1pmdemitm ) , [ ma ucide ea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqruvmffyag ) , [ seara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gysjeutmlvc ) alexandrina hristov - [ orasul umbre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tktg0fncsu ) , [ nimic nu e ca tine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq4_yp6h2ma ) [ angelika vee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hopg6so4jpc ) [ nicoleta nuca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fcoq_l3u_w ) + 2 bonus romanian hotties ; [ alternosfera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyiwga6gocu ) ( alt.rock ) carla 's dreams [ ne bucuram in ciuda lor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyb94o7ojcm ) , [ sub pielea mea/under my skin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vyj3uqcmtm ) , [ te rog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4es6bu1ydvk ) , [ unde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y1rhv52plg ) [ o-zone - de ce plang chitarele / why the guitars sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfyhz6fmat4 ) , [ dan balan ( ex-o-zone ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmkbbpoiuow ) , and of course there are others ... 
  some classical music composers too : the neo-romantic eugen doga - [ my sweet and tender beast - waltz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvug7klacla ) @ 1:15 gets more interesting , and i 'd add the romantic-era ciprian porumbescu ( he was from bukovina , north-east romania , now in ukraine , so not really the present-day moldova republic ) : [ danube fairy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0zm8wqhj6u ) , [ ballad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om3iw5ggqx0 ) and some old traditional folk music : [ trece-un noura\u0219 pe sus / little cloud passing by - by osoianu sisters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5fymesz_gs ) [ ballad ( doina ) - instrumental ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgvn5nyuaqi ) [ female ensamble ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtj3_ztwhwo ) [ male ensamble ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3caaqvvumma ) so you have it all ( well , not all , but the whole music spectrum ) . 
  you do n't know moldova until you listen to its music .

  seriously , you got ta fix your `` totally seeing '' , your sources or your counting skills . 
  countries in east europe do accept refugees - for romania see [ 1 ] ( http://europesworld.org/2016/12/09/romanias-odd-one-stance-refugees/#.wqpgjvl9670 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/articles/2016/12/01/refugees-relocated-by-e-u-struggle-to-get-by-in-romania ) - but on one hand the refugees do n't want to stay and on the other hand we ca n't offer the living standards they expect ( or the standards they assume would receive in western europe ) and lack the resources and experience to integrate them properly . 
  and who on earth would learn romanian , to get a job , anyway , right ? 
  you see , maybe if these eastern european countries would have had colonial empires in the past ( like france and uk , for example ) , they could have built some wealth in those times ( i mean , from the plundering and slave exploitation ) and could have afforded now more resources for integrating the refugees . 
  not knowing how to govern a country , maybe ? 
  not having enough `` capitalist '' experience ( the older ones ) or enough experience in general ( the younger ones ) ? 
  hooray , we are a democracy !, 
  or is it idiocracy ? 
  now you tell it to us ? 
  quite a few weeks late mate !, 
  he/she is not representative of all romanians . 
  he/she should be speaking for himself/herself . 
  i am also sad , for a fellow romanian publicly declares he/she dislikes a country for no particular reason other that he/she can not make the difference between ukraine and russia . 
  that 's quite blunt . 
  you * think * ? 
  that we dislike 'em ?
