  on the other hand , sometimes i feel some of the europeans are `` less equal '' than the others , or have a lower status . 
  i strongly feel there are `` two eu 's '' or `` three europes '' : non-eu , eastern/former communist eu and western eu and that it 's really unlikely that this would change in less than a few centuries . 
  sometimes i see or feel that some of the `` others '' in the western block treat us with disrespect and superiority - even if it might be for good reasons - and it does n't feel nice . 
  it feels unfair , like no matter how honest , educated or hard-working i am , i will almost never be seen by a `` westerner '' as an equal , unless i emigrate and integrate , which i do n't really intend to ( too lazy to exit the comfort zone + have family ) . 
  so , yeah , as i said , mixed feelings . 
  i could n't have said it better . 
  except , in my list i would have added german redditors :d, 
  europe is governed by a secret organization controlled from the shadows buy a secret lizard race . 
   over 500 years of slavery ( until the phase out in the mid-1800s ) , with large pockets of ethnic cleansing and genocide conducted against them , as well as the grotesque forced integration techniques . 
  from an evolutionary point of view , that might explain their high birth rate - it 's like an adaptation to high mortality and low life expectancy . 
  maybe if their birth rate would have been lower , their kind would have been extinct . 
  or , only those with high birth rate survived to pass their genome to the offspring . 
  i think it might sound childish but maybe the solution to all this would be to create a country for them , somewhere in middle east of n / ne africa ( egypt or north from saharan area ? ), 
  but then i wonder how their country would look like , and would they stay there ? 
  damn !, 
  they just had to be romanian gypsies . 
  i just hoped ... wee ... the spanish ppl have their own gypsies , but no , they just f * in had to be romanian . 
  now i 'm hurt in my feelings and expectations . 
  edit : this is gross !, 
  i 've never seen something like that here in romania . 
  well i might have never visited to proper places ? 
  edit2 : this is ... omfg . 
  but what 's funny , they talk to the reporter ( s ) in romanian but argue/fight each other in their language ( rromani language ? 
  is that its name ? 
  oh , some of them are very skilled , in : - confidence stricks - singing `` manele '' - listening to `` manele '' very loud on the street or in public transport - [ might be obsolete/a thing of the past ] `` shell games '' or ( in romanian ) `` alba-neagra '' ( the white - the black ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shell_game - begging at the traffic lights , maybe sometimes washing the windscreen too ... and so on ... 
  this might sound a little politically incorrect or like over-generalizing so ... disclaimer : i do n't think all gypsies do those activities listed above on a regular basis . 
  i ca n't estimate how many of them do . 
  it 's just that we tend to spot easier the ones who are involved in such activities . 
  translated title : `` us study : majority of germans would not defend nato partners '' ( according to spiegel online ) . 
  edit : strangely enough , the study mentioned in the article [ `` these are results of a study presented by the american pew research center '' ] has no mention of germany whatsoever : http://www.pewresearch.org/2015/06/10/ukraine-2015-how-we-approached-our-sample-design-in-light-of-insecurity-in-eastern-ukraine/ wrong link , spiegel ? 
  :d other translated parts ( directly from google translate , unedited ) : 58 percent of german respondents say that germany should the allies do not come to the military aid in case of `` serious military conflict '' between russia and neighboring nato country . 
  this is the peak ahead of france ( 53 ) and italy ( 51 ) ; nato average is 42 percent . 
  only 38 percent of germans would help the partners - so watch article 5 of the nato treaty : an attack on one is an attack on all . 
  at the same time go 68 percent of germans believe that the us would intervene militarily in such a case to protect the nato partners . 
  fewer and fewer german express consent to nato : gifts in 2009 still 73 percent of respondents said they had a positive image of the defense alliance , so there are 2015 only 55 percent . 
  in no other nato country the loss of trust is so serious . 
  while invariably firstly and secondly give all nato countries russia the pro-russian separatists to blame for the violence in eastern ukraine , the values in germany are somewhat lower than elsewhere : say 29 percent , russia was to blame ; 25 percent think that the separatists were responsible ; twelve percent have the west to blame . 
  polish capitalism expanding  good job guys !, 
  i mean no sarcasm . 
  it 's good to see growth and progress in a former eastern block country . 
  i get your joke , but the other half have voted 9 % germany , 4.5 % france and so on . 
  i get you 're hurt we do n't expect norway to help ? 
   j/k, 
  [ article ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/what-countries-do-romanians-like-the-most/168803/ ) in english , from romania-insider . com seems romanians are unexpectedly realistic about what will or can `` europe '' do to help ... 
  i mean ... almost nothing ( ? ), 
  thanks , so that only works for text posts , not for link posts . 
  hey s0me_guy9 , sorry for the off-topic but how do i make a follow-up description of the submission , like you did in yours ( the `` how can i learn more about it etc '' text ) ? 
  i mean the aa + icon . 
  i ca n't seem to find where to insert my comment in order to appear like this . 
  i will appear only as a regular comment . 
  it is also mentioned here : https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1wtacq/what_does_the_aa_icon_next_to_a_reddit_submission/, 
  also , from a different [ article ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-orthodox-church-patriarch-gets-honorary-degree-from-bucharest-polytechnic-university/168827/ ) :  the university awarded this title to patriarch daniel as a recognition of his support to romanian education and for the role the church took in relation to the education institutions , to ensure the continuity of the ancestral faith , according to a press release issued by the university . 
  wtf ? 
  the church 's support to education of engineers and it specialists ? 
  the church succeed a few years ago in convincing the ministry of education to introduce compulsory religion classes in schools . 
  how does this support technical education ? 
  the poor kids ~ ~ learn ~ ~ are indoctrinated in religion instead of learning science or any other useful stuff . 
  the more i read it , the more i realize it 's a disgusting political scheme ^ ( honors for votes or money ) . 
  both the university 's rector mihnea costoiu and the senate chair ( person ) ecaterina andronescu are members of psd ^ ( and most probably politically appointed in their current functions ) . 
  andronescu is also former ministry of education , while costoiu had held various positions in the ministry and was recently re-elected as rector without holding a doctorate degree and without any competition ( [ source ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/special/dezvaluiri/mihnea-costoiu--reales-rector-la-politehnica-fara-contracandidat--sa-fie-doctor--fara-performante-academice--fara-sa-vorbeasca-fluent-o-limba-straina-410476 ) - in romanian ) ~ ~ huston ~ ~ ms k\u00f6vesi - we have a problem !, 
  thank you !, 
  beautiful pictures . 
  i get you too . 
  i 'm a biochemist , not a physicist . 
  i 've loved , studied and read chemistry and biology since i was about 12 . 
  when i was 14 i asked my parents a microscope as birthday present , and told them `` if it 's too expensive , consider it also for 15th birthday '' . 
  so i know about plasmids , mutations , antibiotic resistance , cell metabolism , ... none of them explained in the bible . 
  so i do n't know via personal experience what is age of the universe , but somehow it seems plausible for me to believe science . 
  because science does not invent stuff . 
  like the astrophysicist might have never injected a plasmid or a phage in a cell but he can trust me on that . 
  i have nothing against me being generalized as atheistic or romanian . 
  that 's what i am , after all . 
  and i 'm proud of it - at least of the first of the two . 
  but i do n't consider either of them a form on insult . 
  let 's not apply labels . 
  every person is naive in a certain degree . 
  naive is fine with me . 
  better naive than a believer in supra-natural . 
  naive as i might be , i believe in facts - observed by me or by others . 
  i do n't have to prove something . 
  i just wrote an opinion . 
  and how many murders or wars are there in the name of science or knowledge , huh ? 
  i just ca n't believe in : * wonders * turning water into wine * walking on water * man was created out of clay * the world was created in 7 days * you can get something out of nothing so any other explanation is more plausible to me . 
  physics works with models . 
  each model is `` good enough '' until a better one is developed based on scientific observation . 
  someone mentioned psychiatric evaluation . 
  downvote me as you want but i think all religious people might need one . 
  be it christian , muslim or whatever . 
  because it 's unconceivable ( for me ) how one can believe in something you do n't really know it exists , you just think or wish it does . 
  and then motivate your actions on this ? 
  indeed , the `` civilized '' word has mitigated the bad consequences of religion in current times but look at the past !, 
  and how much of it we see its bad influence on the present . 
  religion - in my opinion - was and is the worst phenomenon the human kind experienced and the root to most evil since ancient times . 
  the little kind gestures made out of religious motivations ( e.g. 
  donations , charities etc ) pale compared to all the bad consequences of religion : lack of `` real '' education , hate , wars , lack of true healthcare . 
  edited :d, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates excluding micro-countries and non-eu , estonia , latvia , bulgaria and romania have low corporate taxes too . 
  but 0 % in estonia ? 
  o_0 where does the state get enough money from , to pay its government , pm 's , infrastructure ... ? 
  of course i was joking,
