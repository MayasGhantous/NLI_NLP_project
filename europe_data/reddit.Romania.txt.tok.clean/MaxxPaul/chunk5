  o _ ( ) damn , i was hoping to win this , maybe they offer a ferry trip from tallinn to helsinki . 
   i 'm in !, 
  i can understand shipping the migs by maritime transport , but shipping the tanks by plane ? 
  would n't be cheaper to send them by train ? 
  the translation is wrong . 
  correct version : our migs will be * shipped * to riga , our tanks will * land * in prague - they mean military technology export . 
  it 's a jungle where the `` strong '' win ( e.g. 
  cheat taxes ) and the weak are those who pay them . 
  the weak suckers pay taxes while the slicks find ways all kind of ways not to pay , on all levels -- from the `` self-employed '' ppl working without declaring incomes , without invoices and without paying invoice tax ( value-added tax ) to the big fish with off-shore companies . 
  you got the whole spectrum . 
  the only advantage for those who are correct is that * normally * you sleep better at night , no having anything illegal to worry . 
  but i wonder how many of the others are really found and fined/convicted ... 
  there are no * legal * ways to pay less taxes on salary while working in eu . 
  that is , not until you find a panama/bahamas/seychelles - based employer ( and even in this case , i think some of the taxes are compulsory by law - you have to declare your annual income in your country , and pay tax ) . 
  most if not all eu countries impose wage taxes that include income tax ( from the company income and from the employee income ) and social security taxes ( the compulsory health insurance , retirement fond , unemployment insurance ... ) . 
  how can you avoid that , * legally * ? 
  there is of course , the black market - such as a mechanic doing small car repairs in his free time and getting paid , or people who do masonry/wall painting/plumbing/electric installation without being employed - no invoice , no value-added tax , no wage tax . 
  i tutor your kid in english/chemistry/guitat , you paint my walls .

  well , there 's more to it . 
  it seemed to me this submission has been downvoted quite a lot . 
  i was quite surprised , then thought le pen must have a lot of supporters , who do n't like this article . 
  panarama must be the comparative . 
  `` server error '' ... 
  i guess there are so many readers that the site crashed . 
  that , or a dos from le pen 's supporters ? 
  well , yeah , i forgot about that . 
  it 's schengen . 
  and i do want equality / but not for little dogs - [ grigore alexandrescu ] ( http://europeanfablewaytohumanvalues.weebly.com/uploads/4/2/7/8/4278416/fables-booklet-final.pdf ) i feel i need to explain my rant and the quote from the romanian fable about equality . 
  it 's not about le pen 's ideology , of course . 
  it 's about the values western europe declares and use to set itself somehow apart , compared to `` lesser '' members of ue . 
  they are teaching lessons and pointing fingers to other countries but using double standard regarding corruption . 
  how clean is the west europe actually ? 
  france : patrick balkany , politician , deputy les r\u00e9publicains , mayor of levallois-perret j\u00e9r\u00f4me cahuzac , former minister of the budget fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric chatillon , businessman , linked to marine le pen and the front national nicolas crochet , chartered accountant , linked to marine le pen and the front national jean-marie le pen , father of marine le pen , politician and former president of the front national https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_named_in_the_panama_papers#other_government_officials, 
  how many of these `` high-ranking '' politician are from schengen countries ? 
  ughhh , this cant be . 
  i thought they definitely said schengen area is free from high level corruption . 
  azerbaijan = 95 % muslims ( of which 85 % shia and 15 % sunni ) . 
  probability of perpetrators being shia muslims = 80.75 %, 
  partnership for peace ... 
  oh , they do have a few `` elites '' : http://www.romaniajournal.ro/new-corruption-case-dna-asks-for-psd-mp-madalin-voicus-preventive-detention-anaf-heads-prosecuted-for-abuse-of-office/ madalin voicu , violonis and conductor - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c4%83d%c4%83lin_voicu is n't corruption elites ' petty crime ? 
  you mean this one ? 
  that is true , our coastline is not that long and there is a lot of improvement both on the seaside and in the cities . 
  but in the current climate , i 'd rather spend my vacations here . 
  it would be first time in a few years , and the first time i 'm really hesitant to travel abroad . 
  suddenly none of my past options ( france , greece , turkey and even bulgaria ) look appealing anymore . 
  looking for a safer tourist destination ? 
  hei , * even * the russians have returned something : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietroasele_treasure you swedes got to be nicer than them , right ? 
  better later than never !, 
  most likely , but how damn unlucky ( or stupid ) one must be to do that !, 
  i know , but what country had bears first ? 
  just kiddin ' , 
  hei , ursus is a romanian beer , not a polish tractor !, 
  interesting article . 
  but i wonder , if only al-qaeda commits its attacks as its * raison d'etre * , then what are the motivations of is ? 
  they can prove they are able to commit attacks and mass murders but i really do n't understand what are they trying to achieve on long term . 
  are they doing this only to convince the `` west '' not to involve in middle east , and leave it all to them ? 
  most other terrorist organizations have a clear objective - they are `` protesting '' this way for a territory that they consider occupied , or that they want it split out of a country and so on ... 
  but if is hopes through their attacks they will force `` the west '' not to involve , they actually might get the opposite outcome . 
  edit : wow , look at this : https://www.google.ro/search?q=what+is+isis+or+isil+trying+to+achieve&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=vpz7vogshkkcygo21jpoaw a lot of people is asking this question over and over ... 
  i think the author of the article ( ben green ) needs support - for his math education , that is ... 2 \\* x = 4 is an equation 2 \\* 2 is just a arithmetic expression, 
  of course it 's 288 , what were you thinking ? 
  you do n't know the whole story , after leaving lidl and still being unable to find a toilette , our hotel being some 20 km in the opposite direction , we reached the outskirts of the city , and ended peeing outdoors `` in the nature '' like true savages :d one of the happiest moments in my life , ` cos i was the one who needed it from the beginning . 
  wishful thinking maybe ? 
  we knew lidl does n't have toilette but we thought lidl in germany might be special , 
  thanks for the advice . 
   you too !, 
  because i 'm not looking for votes ? 
  lmao . 
  i do n't really care , i was just agreeing with the article in the most concise possible way . 
  although if you do get downvoted , why bother writing , right ? 
  i guess i 'm still rather new on reddit . 
  hey , i always wondered do artists ( music bands , singers ) that visit slovakia or slovenia mistake them one for the other due to their names starting with the same four letters ? 
  we had a few cases ( i think madonna , michael jackson and metallica in ' 99 ) who started their bucharest concerts with `` hello budapest '', 
  i did n't think it as a conspiracy , but only as a possible long term effect . 
  having the same problem , the same enemy , does unite nations . 
  i 'm not a religious person but `` god-forbid '' if they do so easily their attacks , i wonder how safe is the pope , really ? 
  it happend int the past , right ? 
  now they are fixed on the nato/eu , but would n't be the pope a `` good enough '' target too ? 
  i do n't respect him as a religious person really , since i 'm atheist , but i do respect him as a nice person who tries to promote peace . 
  i would be sorry if something would happen to him . 
  this . 
  i do n't think it 's really incompetence . 
  i suppose a country 's security forces and intelligence agencies might receive hundreds of suspect reports per day . 
  i suppose it would be close to impossible to find them all and interrogate them , and even if you do ... they benefit of the presumption of innocence according to most legals systems . 
  i think also one of the perpetrators in paris was known to the turkish authorities as a possible terrorist . 
  haha , i was once taken for a terrorist . 
  sort of . 
  i was last year in germany with 3 coworkers for a training and something really funny happened . 
  after having dinner and leaving a restaurant , one of us forgot to take a pee before leaving , and needed that badly . 
  we did n't want to return to the same restaurant just for a damn pee and we thought we 'd better find a pub or a supermarket ( we wanted to do some shopping too ) that would have some kind of toilette . 
  after driving around for about 10 minutes in that little city , we stopped in a lidl parking and we were approached by a couple of policemen in civilian clothing ( they had two cars , with no police markings , one parked next to us and one on the main road ) , asking for a id/passport check because they thought it was suspicious we were driving around for so long in the city . 
  fact is , they saw us * before * getting to the restaurant to have dinner , tried to follow us and lost us ( how can police lose some foreigners driving with 30-40 km/h on side roads in a small city , looking on the gps for a restaurant ??? 
  ) , and then saw us again after we left maybe two hours later , in our desperate search for a toilette and they thought we 've been driving for all that time throughout the city , and that looked suspicious . 
  they were polite but stubborn in their goal - we told them what company we were visiting , even shown them marketing material/brochures , our badges , all in vain : they had to do the check via their radio station . 
  and one of us was dying to take a pee meanwhile !, 
  we talked some chit-chat and then in maybe 3-5 minutes we were clear to go find a fucking toilette . 
  that was happening in a lidl parking lot . 
  and yes , lidl do n't have toilette . 
  there might be some truth behind this .
