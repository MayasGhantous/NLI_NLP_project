  they are as oppisite as the can be : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/color_star-en_%28tertiary_names%29.svg absolutely no harmony . 
  and about the best : any flag consisting of two colours ( with or without extra white or black ) . 
  especially i like poland 's flag . 
  most probably its battery ran out and crashed ,

  well ... it 's not the same submission `` per se '' , but i admit i did n't notice the other one ( from bbc ) . 
  i can imagine how that worked ... [ turkish military ] : `` unidentified aircraft , you are violating turkey 's air space , please change direction or we are going to open fire '' [ drone ] : blip blip i 'm a drone i ca n't hear you .

  lmao, 
  i 've known a service engineer during a training in germany ( we were there from all of the europe ) . 
  he was from russia and was very content with their government and external affairs . 
  i could n't believe how indoctrinated and/or one-sighted he appeared to be . 
  he had an answer to any question ( such as about democracy , crimea etc ) - directly from the russia 's official propaganda machine . 
  i remember before the romanian revolution , when i was a teenager ( e.g. 
  12 y.o. ), 
  i was explaining - when talking about politics with other kids - ( seems strange but sometimes kids did that , in those times - we had no fb and youtube ) how good socialism was , because everybody had jobs and was being taken care of by the state , while in capitalism they had lots of jobless people and poverty ... lol . 
  well nazis , germans , central powers ( pre-1945 ) ... 
  i just slipped the word nazi instead of `` german army '' without realizing this . 
  it 's my fault , do n't blame the source . 
  well now it has 97 % or 87 % - not sure which one is the approval score . 
  i 'm shocked . 
  i guess it 's a matter of taste ( being a huge sci fi fan i hated `` inception '' too , which also was praised by lots of people ) . 
  otoh i see i 'm not the only one : https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/36bkpn/serious_can_someone_please_explain_why_mad_max/ edit : i thought it was terrible because it had too much kitsch in my opinion and even failed to produce on me the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a work of fiction . 
  everything seemed forced and implausible . 
   we fought with the turks as allies , as absurd as that may seem absurd ? 
  you were allied with them as members of the central powers , were you not ? 
  romanian occupiers ? 
  i guess all those historians got it wrong about what happened in 1916 . 
  they say bulgaria together with the ~ ~ nazi ~ ~ [ edited as per silence_hr note ] german army invaded dobrudja from south , opening a second front that proved vital for occupying southern romania by the central powers :  while the romanian army was advancing in transylvania , the first counterattack came from field marshal august von mackensen in command of a multi-national force composed of the bulgarian third army , a german brigade and two divisions of the ottoman vi army corps , whose units began arriving on the dobrudja front after the initial battles . 
  this army attacked north from bulgaria , starting on september 1 . 
  it stayed on the south side of the danube river and headed towards constan\u021ba . 
  the romanian garrison of turtucaia , encircled by bulgarian troops ( aided by a column of german troops ) surrendered on september 6 . 
  the romanian third army made further attempts to withstand the enemy offensive at silistra , dobrich , amzacea and topraisar , but had to withdraw under the pressure of superior enemy forces . 
  mackensen 's success was favoured by the allies ' failure to fulfill the obligation they had assumed through the military convention , by virtue of which they had to mount an offensive on the macedonian front and the conditions in which the russians deployed insufficient troops on the battlefront in the south-east of romania . 
  these factors meant that the romanian forces became too strained to put up effective resistance against the enemy advance . 
  romania had to fight on two 1,600 km-long battlefronts , the longest front in europe , with a varied configuration and diverse geographical elements ( by comparison , the russian front , stretching from the baltic sea until bukovina , was only 1,000 km long ) . 
  and later on :  back on the coast , field marshal mackensen and bulgarian general stefan toshev launched a new offensive on october 19 , after a month of careful preparations , and achieved a decisive victory in the second battle of cobadin . 
  the romanians and russians were forced to withdraw out of constan\u021ba ( occupied by the central powers on october 22 ) . 
  after the fall of cernavod\u0103 , the defense of the unoccupied dobruja was left only to the russians , who were gradually pushed back towards the marshy danube delta . 
  the russian army was now both demoralized and nearly out of supplies . 
  mackensen felt free to secretly pull a large number of troops back to the town of svishtov in bulgaria with an eye towards crossing the danube river . 
  and towards the end of 1916 :  on december 1 , the romanian army went ahead with the offensive along the arge\u0219 and neajlov rivers . 
  initially , the romanians experienced success , taking a large number of prisoners , however mackensen was able to shift forces to deal with the sudden assault and falkenhayn 's forces responded with attacks at every point . 
  faced with the overwhelming superiority of the invading forces , the romanian army , its ranks thinned from the previous actions , inferior in equipment and lacking russian support , failed to check the enemy advance . 
  although it recorded numerous daring actions ( among these the prunaru charge , in which the 2nd ro\u015fiori cavalry regiment was almost wiped out ) , the battle of arge\u015f-neajlov ended unfavourably for the romanian army . 
  within three days , the attack had been shattered and the romanians were retreating everywhere . 
  bucharest was captured on december 6 by falkenhayn 's cavalry . 
  the romanian second army made a fighting retreat to the siret river , which had originally been fortified against the russians and was facing the wrong direction but nevertheless would end up proving invaluable , protected by the impassable danube delta to the southeast and a flank in the carpathians in the northwest . 
  fierce fighting took place at r\u00e2mnicu s\u0103rat between december 22 -- 26 , with mackensen 's forces entering the town on december 27 . 
  around this time , the russians began sending numerous reinforcements to moldavia to prevent an invasion of southern russia . 
  southern romania , including oltenia , muntenia , dobruja and southern moldavia , was now in the hands of the central powers . 
  while retreating , the romanians burnt stores of grain and destroyed oil wells to prevent them from being used by the germans . 
   the remaining russo-romanian forces in dobruja abandoned m\u0103cin on january 4 and br\u0103ila on january 5 . source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_during_world_war_i#kingdom_of_romania_enters_the_war.2c_late_august_1916 please do note that constanta , macin and others cities mentioned are not in southern dobdrudja , but in the northern ( romanian ) one . 
  so the fights took place in romania , not bulgaria . 
  last mad max movie was terrible . 
  big disappointment . 
  too good to be true ? 
  how many muslims would adhere to these concepts ? 
   romania right there ... 
  i mean , on the same page lol , 
  romania seems to be the most isolated . 
  anyway this kind of displaying the data is inherently flawed , because the distance between two countries on the map is proportional to the sum of `` unfavorable views '' between the two , but it does n't really show what is that `` sum '' made of '' . 
  two countries might have a score for `` bad view '' of each other , of `` 50 '' so the distance is 100 , while other two might have 100 and 0 and the distance would be the same . 
  i 'd say in the first case the relationship between the two countries would be friendlier , than in the latter . 
  http://i.imgur.com/pkuowo9.png or https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/romanis-historical-distribution.png why do n't italians from rome ( romans ? ), 
  have the same problem ? 
  anyway , r ( r ) omani is a [ misnomer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misnomer ) because is a wrong name given by others and ( later ) assumed by themselves , without properly representing their origin . 
  gypsy is too a misnomer . 
  the are not from egypt and not from rome or byzantium ... but still they got to be named as such ... 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#endonyms ) the greek and the ancient romans are to blame for that : '' probably from greek \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 `` roman '' , signifying inhabitants of byzantium , who considered themselves successors of ancient rome '', 
   seriously you never heard of metro newspapers ? 
  that 's a massive press group , i 'm surprised you do n't have it in romania as well . 
  obviously i was joking , ( maybe the / s was too subtle ? ), 
  i realize it 's a newspaper , but since ( afaik ) we do n't have it in romania i ca n't help from thinking of the supermarket chain when i see the word `` metro '' . 
  would a french businessman register the newspaper name auchan in france ? 
   i think `` metro '' it 's already irremediably connected to the en-gross shop meaning - at least in romania ( do n't know about germany , but i would doubt they have it as newspaper too ) . 
  cats = miau dogs = ham ham birds = cip cirip hen = cotcodac rooster = cucurigu !, 
  cows = muu ( pronounced moooo ... ) sheeps = bee or behehe ( or mee or mehehe ) - pronounced with `` e '' like in net ( but longer ) ducks = mac mac ( pronounced with `` a '' as in `` cup '' ) geese = ga ga horse = ihaha donkey = i-ha, 
  til metro has a newspaper . 
  hopefully tesco will follow ? 
   here is mine about colectiv :p ugh ... not personally connected to colectiv in any sort , but i think joking about that would be really gross . 
  i think fire jokes are tabu or bad taste for at least 10 years from now on ... 
  i wonder where that little river flows into , eventually ... danube ? 
  maybe poorest of the rich ( so to speak ) , but still richer than the ( really ) poor :d i always wondered why is n't portugal following the rule ( large colonial empire -  `` rich '' country ) . 
  after all , they had the 4th [ largest empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_empires#largest_empires_by_land_area_and_population ) in western europe . 
  lol ... illegal `` waggon '' parking . 
   us troops training in moldova the moldavian tank does n't look bad either !, 
  spellchecker fun : recently i was shocked to see a spellchecker still suggests ~ ~ r ** u ** mania ~ ~ ( nope , it was r ** ou ** mania , actually ) in british english - yep , just checked again , it 's chrome 's one . 
  switching to us english changes the suggestion to r ** o ** mania . 
  this has a [ special meaning ] ( https://translate.google.com/?hl=en#en/ro/the%20dick ) for romanian tourists . 
  nice ruins by the way . 
  hey , do n't put the blame on me , it 's not me who used flash - they did it , it 's their official website ( well philharmonic 's one anyway ) . 
  but i think the 360 degree panoramas are nice . 
  allow the page a few seconds to load . 
  help and photo descriptions in romanian but you should understand them easily . 
  too bad they did n't create a real english version . 
  you can pan/rotate by dragging the mouse , and navigate from area to area by clicking the little circles with a description in their tooltips . 
  more information on their [ website ] ( http://fge.org.ro/en/romanian-atheneum.html ) - actually the site of `` george enescu philharmonic orchestra '' . 
  a loot of clicking is needed to get inside so here 's an image from inside : http://festivalenescu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bucharest-enescu-festival-romanian-athenaeum-950x612.jpg,
