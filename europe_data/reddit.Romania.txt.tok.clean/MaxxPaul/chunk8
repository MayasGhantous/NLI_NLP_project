  oh , it was at a fitness centre . 
  i thought he slipped and hit his head on a bullet . 
  you must have got ~ ~ ten ~ ~ the wrong chart version . 
  it 's keeping the `` defence ties '' what the chart says ( in my interpretation that would mean e.g. 
  being part of nato ) , and not `` to defend them '' as you misread . 
  and i do n't see any mention of `` british tax payers hard earned money to subside them '' . 
  interesting that bucharest has a higher gdp than madrid and almost reaches helsinki . 
  of course , this could be due to commuting , so in a way , these statistics - for regions - are not that relevant . 
  maybe the country ones make more sense . 
  and even those could be flawed by the inverse of the commuting effect - the `` outflow '' ( working abroad ) reduces gdp per capita of the initial country or area , if the people still have their id cards registered there but produce gdp somewhere else ( or in a different country ) . 
  if a person from ne romania , with a romanian id card and residence , temporarily works ( contract-based ) in western europe , where is this person 's gdp registered ? 
  there can be [ only one ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gixnh ) !, 
  romania offers free education too , up to post-graduate/master/phd level ( iirc phd is free only if `` full time '' and having no other job meanwhile ) and i bet the number of those who leave romania after finishing their studies is much higher compared to denmark . 
  not only most of the foreign students leave , but evem many of the romanian ones . 
  some leave right after getting their diplomas , but there are also those who work a few years here , then leave as experienced professionals . 
  while there 's no doubt romanian universities rankings are not as high as western/north-european ones , the ones in cluj-napoca , bucharest , timisoara and iasi are good-enough to be sought by ( the more adventurous ) students in the rest of eu . 
  it 's not uncommon to have greek students in bucharest medical university or german/austrian students in cluj-napoca . 
  some of the foreign students attend free of charge ( limited availability , subject to entry exams ) , some pay the fees ( usually about 600-800 $ / year , with medical university in bucharest being the most expensive at 1200 $ / year ) . 
  first russia , then uk , then usa , now turkey ... eu is so lonely now . 
  their genetic mix changes every time is invoked in an argument , according to what suits them better . 
   ~ ~ enemies of the people ~ ~ the foreign agents ( in ceausescu-speak `` agenturily '' ), 
   noneducated people no guts , no glory , but why is `` the guts '' mostly with the non-educated ? 
  it must be their lack of `` common sense '', 
  iraq simulator has denuvo . 
  it says `` wait for crack '' . 
  and what ? 
  i was just saying that being saved after 9 minutes in water , probably unconscious , is amazing and quite lucky ( that is , if she survives ) . 
   til romania makes wine . 
  they have been doing it ( and drinking it ) for quite a some time now : http://www.vitis-metamorfosis.com/en/the-history-of-wine-and-viticulture-in-romania/ edit : [ here ] ( http://romaniancoins.org/repliciromane06.html ) are some roman imperial coins ( replicas ) , including - in upper right corner - a coin with '' a woman personifiyng dacia , holding in the left hand a roman standard , two children holding a wheat sheaf and grapes , inscription dacia august , in exergue provincia and s \u00b7 c '' and here is how a real coin looks now ( not reconstructed replica ) : http://tjbuggey.ancients.info/images/trajdackids.jpg, 
  true . 
  i guess it 's not enough to complain about our image , if we do n't change / do enough for it to change . 
  what balance of power if , according to your previously posted opinion , `` the missile defence project is just a cynical money grab '' ? 
  if that 's all the project is , then russia could ignore it completely , right ? 
  why would it feel compelled to enter a new arms race , competing with a useless project , or protest against it out of fear `` their economy is n't up to it '' ? 
  so i think the above works as a * reductio ad absurdum * proof that in fact , the project has a certain usefulness/efficiency and russia ca n't ignore it . 
  nah , i really do n't think so . 
  romanian rap is indeed a musical and social phenomenon reflecting the state of society , but the lyrics and language ... 
  sometimes i wish some rap groups could keep the good music and drop the language . 
   romania does n't have a `` country premium '' sadly , this is because we are not seen as a `` cool '' country . 
  most of the europeans ( including maybe even most of romanians ) see romania as a `` shitty '' country ( that is , if they care to have a view on romania ) . 
  so no good products could come from a `` shitty '' country , that 's the general perception . 
   there 's no point in acting surprised about it . 
  all the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning department in alpha centauri for 50 of your earth years , so you 've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it 's far too late to start making a fuss about it now . 
  ... then ... there 's nothing left to say now , except `` so long , and thanks for all the fish '', 
   the whole missile defence project is just a cynical money grab . 
  no one except defence contractors have anything to gain from a new arms race . 
  if that would be true , russia would n't care so much . 
  totally irrelevant but here it is - [ bad joke - romanian rap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8h2klxyhrs ),

  edit : i do n't get it , my post is down-voted just for noticing the article is pay-walled ? 
  i understand from the news that she was saved after 9 minutes floating face down ? 
  i wonder how is this even possible - was she unconscious ? 
  i read that in case of drowning , a laringospasm and a lower water temperature might increase the chance of survival , but still ... 9 minutes ? 
  nice . 
  thanks for the info . 
   what kind of idiot well , not your kind , but is there any other ? 
  look , man , you 're not paying attention , or are either `` incapable '' of understating , or just do n't want to ( because it does n't serve you ? ) . 
  you are quoting the wrong statistic for the wrong idea . 
  the 96.4 % number is not the number of romanians owning a house it 's - according to the wikipedia page you 've linked - `` the ratio of owner-occupied units to total residential units in a specified area '' . 
  i 'm sure it 's not that hard to understand for a person who can read english and has at least an average iq . 
  it 's the number of owner-occupied residences divided by the total number of residences [ in that country ] . 
  it 's a rate of ownership ( = the state of being owned by their residences ) of the residences . 
  the statistic strictly refers to residences and does not consider the population or residents . 
  geez . 
  you are reading the statistic wrong . 
  look better - it 's `` the ratio of owner-occupied units to total residential units in a specified area '' . 
  that is , in the specified area ( each country ) , x percent of the total residential units are owner-occupied . 
  that only proves that 96.4 % of the apartments/houses in romania are occupied by their owners ( or owned by their residents , same thing ) . 
  * that does n't give any information about how many people do not own a house/apartment * . 
  the 96.4 % is not the percentage of romanians owning the residence they inhabit , but its the percentage of residences inhabited by their owners . 
  i 'll give you a hypothetical example : there are 20 million romanians living in romania and there are 5 million residences ( houses/apartments etc ) accommodating 15 million persons ( e.g. 
  in average 3 persons per residence ) . 
  out if these 5 million residences , 96,4 % are owned by their residents ( e.g 4.82 million ) while the rest are owned by landlords/companies that rent them . 
  so , even if 96,4 % of the residences are occupied by their owners , you still have ( in my example ) 5 million people not owning a residence , and that would be 25 % of the population . 
  my two conclusions : 1 . 
  romania and france can into scandinavia . 
  sorry denmark ( and findland ) but you ca n't into scandinavia without the proper ( pass ) word for wine ( which should be exactly `` vin '' ) . 
  and no , ( palo ) viina does not count . 
  four regions in europe ( basque country , greece , hungary and karelia ) are fake europeans . 
  you do n't get to be european without a proper wine word - that is , starting with `` v '' or `` w '' . 
  i know basques have an excuse - they were here way before , as proto-europeans , while karelia ( according to the map ) can not into wine . 
  but what 's your excuse , greece and hungary , huh ? 
  ( i purposely left out of these the gagauz people in southern moldova , since they simply speak turkish , so in their case it 's all right . ), 
  romania receiving american aid in 1918 ? 
  what a joke !, 
  any source for that , besides the said joke ? 
   serbians but you were replying to a redditor with a bulgarian flair . 
  ( not saying that the ottomans did n't do a lot of bad to all the countries in the balkans - but i see you know that already ) . 
   smthhappy : yeah and took young kids for their armies and killed everyone when they conquered and stopped progress in their domains , pretty cool guys !, 
   eldorado1234 : how else are you going to rule a huge empire though ? 
  i 'm not explicitly saying the ottomans were hot shit , you know . 
  also make sense that the first person to respond to this would be ... you know ... of your origin . 
   conformism and at least some of the following : - cowardice/too much respect for tradition/family - they do/say what the tradition/family ( especially elders ) say it 's right , they 're `` afraid '' to differ ( do n't want the `` complications '' / disapproval that might occur ) - do n't know/don ' t care/lack of own opinion - it 's easier to use majority 's - lack of education ( especially in science ), 
  this is embarrassing . 
  self-irony , so typically balkan , 
  i was hoping for [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3a0oath.jpg ), 
   ( and germany does n't make the top 10 ) romania stronk , makes it to top 10, 
  i do n't mind the clubs spending , if there 's a market for that . 
  it 's their money ( club owners ' money and paying fans ' money ) .
