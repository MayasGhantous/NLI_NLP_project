  they are not charity , they are entertainment business . 
  if people pay to see good sportsmen play , so be it . 
  ( it 's a pity though , that an average football player gets paid millions of euros per year , while a good neurosurgeon gets , in romania , less than 20,000 euro/year ) . 
  but church -- that 's a different matter . 
  they get money from the believers - that 's fine , it 's their money , but they also get money from the state , from the public budget , and that 's not really ok ( democracy and rule of majority is sometimes quite a bitch ) . 
  but there 's another thing . 
  they got their priorities so wrong . 
  if the additional role of the church in a society is - in general - to do good things for the society , they could do charities . 
  they could spend their money to do really good things . 
  a cathedral does no good ( in my opinion ) or at least , objectively , does quite a lot less good and is a lot less needed than building hospitals , schools and motorways . 
  how did you guess that ? 
  indeed i prefer basketball . 
  but please do tell , how did you guess it ? 
   nuclear bunkers yeah , so our esteemed orthodox church leaders will be safe there . 
  i feel so better now . 
  oh , but what about the rest ? 
  we need more of these big churches , please / s, 
  ummm based on what statistics/polls ? 
  the ( at least ) 200 million us$ atrocity , that 21st century god mall . 
  the 1500 schools or 300km highway not built , or the 40 hospitals not fully equipped with high end , last generation medical devices - that 's the cathedral . 
  i am all `` live and let live '' , and all that , but knowing this how ca n't you start hating religion ? 
  ( ok i 'm an atheist too ), 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantin_br%c3%a2ncu%c8%99i ) : constantin br\u00e2ncu\u0219i ( romanian : [ konstan\u02c8tin br\u0268\u014b\u02c8ku\u0283\u02b2 ] ; february 19 , 1876 -- march 16 , 1957 ) was a romanian sculptor , painter and photographer who made his career in france . 
  considered a pioneer of modernism , one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th-century , br\u00e2ncu\u0219i is called the patriarch of modern sculpture . 
  as a child he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden farm tools . 
  formal studies took him first to bucharest , then to munich , then to the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts in paris from 1905 to 1907 . 
  his art emphasizes clean geometrical lines that balance forms inherent in his materials with the symbolic allusions of representational art . 
  br\u00e2ncu\u0219i sought inspiration in non-european cultures as a source of primitive exoticism , as did paul gauguin , pablo picasso , andr\u00e9 derain and others . 
  but other influences emerge from romanian folk art traceable through byzantine and dionysian traditions . 
  happy national day !, 
  goulash and palinka ftw !, 
  romanian nation was formed after the dacian kingdom was conquered by the romans , on the territory of dacian kigdom , under roman rule and cultural influence . 
  for me , it 's the same nation , it only changed language . 
  if this applies for the english * ( britons + romans + germanic angles + normans etc ) , i do n't see why it would n't be valid for romanians ( dacians + romans + some other influences ) . 
  so for me , the lands of the dacian kindgom are previously united lands of what was to become the romanian nation . 
  * [ english nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_people ) formed from pre-roman britons , post-roman germanic tribes including the angles , plus some danes and normans . 
  their language changed throught time but still they are a nation . 
  i read that wrong . 
  i meant transylvania was not larger than half of the former hungarian kingdom . 
  it was less than 1/3 of the total area ( 325,411 ) . 
  i do n't see the point comparing to present-day territory , instead of comparing with the one that was then . 
  from wikipedia : it left hungary as a landlocked state covering 93,073 square kilometres ( 35,936 sq mi ) , only 28 % of the 325,411 square kilometres ( 125,642 sq mi ) that had constituted the pre-war kingdom of hungary ( the hungarian half of the austro-hungarian monarchy ) . 
  and the bullshit part refers to not mentioning the romanian population ( 2.8 million ) and using the term `` annexation '', 
  ~ ~  a territory that 's larger than what remained of hungary ~ ~ ( wrong quote ) that 's not only wrong , but complete bullshit , and i bet you know it deep inside, 
  ` caus you said `` these lands were never togheter '' - were n't they ? 
   your side of the story is just wrong . 
  it was n't reunification because these lands were never toghether to form romania before besides michael the brave and existing ethnicity during middle ages , there 's the previous [ dacian kingdom under burebista ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burebista#dacian_kingdom ) one people , one kingdom - united enuf for ya ? 
  oh , and dacian pottery in present-day budapest area , circa 100 bc . 
   how do romanians feel about the rights of ethnic hungarians in transylvania ? 
  as a romanian i feel they have a lot of rights , while many of them not only do n't love the country which granted them those rights , but even publicly declare they hate it - the country or its values . 
  it 's not their fault that they were born here , but it 's not ours either and many of them make no effort to get along with the romanians . 
   zerg zerg sound pretty slavic to me . 
  or tzarist , if you prefer , 
  palatschinke and strudel slavs, 
  a minister for economic affairs of a smaller eu member state said : `` we have been very controversial for two years , but i am proud to announce that my country is ready for a bilateral strategic partnership with china . '', 
  i 'm curious , what country was the minister from ?

  russia can be enraged even about what happens in a conflict-free country : [ the guardian , may 2016 : kremlin angered as us switches on missile shield in romania ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/us-hails-important-step-as-missile-defences-go-live-in-romania ) [ the independent , feb. 2017 : russia calls romania a ` clear threat ' and nato outpost for hosting us missile shield ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-romania-clear-threat-nato-outpost-us-anti-missile-shield-putin-tensions-a7571031.html ) [ reuters , may 2016 : putin says romania , poland may now be in russia 's cross-hairs ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-europe-shield-iduskcn0yi2er ),

  i 'm not sure which one is the sarcasm tag for , 
  busted !, 
  that 's russian , not romanian . 
  do a google image search and see [ most of the results ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=statusuri+caterinca&amp;hl=ro-us&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=672&amp;tbs=simg:caqslqej404psoy9kt8aiqelekju2aqaaggjdasqsiyncbpicmaiaxio1bcihocf1rccg7qf8bgrej0q1hc9jyww3y-llt0v8c-nmj0x7c-gmrowa57uomsuxo_1zn1njfztbcjeuvqz8_10g_1sprswwisnzcjghm-1awhznqng1vbidfniaqmcxcorv4iggokcagbegqbue2mda,isz:m&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnt&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjf_djlnctsahxbajokhw_lauuqpwuieg&amp;dpr=1 ) are from russian sites . 
  the image was later used on some romanian website ( s ) to make fun of stupid facebook status ideas .

  i might be wrong , but i think i saw this image in a russian action-comedy film . 
   hot you mean rachel welch , 
  wait , why did they wear croatian costumes in australia ? 
  i thought they wear gondolas throughout the whole year . 
  til in fact they wear masks . 
  yes , i know gondola is a boat , just sayin ' ... :d, 
   it does n't explain the mystery how 160 people can leave at once and disappear gypsy magic . 
  it ** is ** the mardi gras period after all . 
  i 'm not sure if anyone noticed , the 3rd photo is of raquel welch . 
  i found a long list of celebrities supposedly [ wearing romanian blouses ] ( https://positivenewsromania.com/2016/06/24/6613/ ) . 
  at first i was a little skeptical , thinking similar blouses might exist throughout all eastern europe and balkans , with various designs . 
  but then i checked about jackie chan and zhang ziyi , and at least in their case , according to [ getty images ] ( http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/hong-kong-actor-jackie-chan-wears-a-traditional-romanian-news-photo/455255338#hong-kong-actor-jackie-chan-wears-a-traditional-romanian-outfit-a-picture-id455255338 ) it 's true . 
  i know daily mail it 's not a `` reliable source '' , but according to [ them ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2812750/romanian-peasant-blouse-fashion.html ) , * the `` ie '' ( ee-yeh ) is an intricately embroidered gossamer-thin garment originally worn by byzantine nobles in the sixteenth century and later adopted by peasants . 
   no adidas ? 
  nah , that 's the russian dress : http://9gag.com/gag/azeovzq/they-really-love-adidas-in-russia, 
  indeed , romania is the only romance language having an enclitic definite article ( added at the end of the word ) . 
  for feminine nouns usually - a is added ( or the last vowel is replaced with a ) , as in : floare -  floarea ( flower -  the flower ) patrie -  patria ( homeland -  the homeland ) for masculine nouns it 's - ul , - l , or - le ( usually ) , e.g. 
  soldat -  soldatul ( soldier -  the soldier ) c\u00e2ine -  c\u00e2inele ( dog -  the dog ), 
  that 's interesting . 
  since you mention an english-born lady wearing `` ie '' , i remember i saw photos of queen marie of romania ( pricess marie of edinburgh ) wearing it on multiple occasions - [ there are quite a few ] ( http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/imagini-regina-maria-n-tradi-ionala-ie-rom-neasc ) . 
  note ( and unnecessary romanian grammar lesson ) : * `` ia '' * is the articled noun , pronounced in 2 syllables , with accent of the first one ( \u00ed-a ) , * `` ie '' * is the noun without article ; * `` ii '' * is the plural, 
  i could swear i 've seen exactly the same map , here on \\ r \\ europe just a few weeks ago . 
  edit : [ as someone else pointed out ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59boyx/who_do_europeans_joke_about_most_xpost_from/ ) it was actually 4 months ago ; time flies ... 
  i agree with the location of the plant , nothing wrong with it . 
  i 'm not sure how glad the croats are , though , about this . 
  i saw the thumbnail and thought it was one of those jokes : * a shoulder , a door , a wall and a hand walk into a ~ ~ bar ~ ~ meeting ... *, 
  for this kind of fair play , i regret there 's no `` 100 upvotes '' button . 
  edit : typo, 
  bah ... those finns , they never forget to forget romania . 
  this is an article about him , published 20 years ago in the independent : http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/obituary-ion-voicu-5578546.html, 
  maybe they did n't agree on the exact count of scotch bottles . 
  i mean , 2000 $ could mean 20 bottles of scotch @ 5 $ / 35ml ( 100 $ / 70cl bottle ) . 
  so the customers might thought , hey , this guy is trying to rip us off , let 's get outta here , we 're not paying for what we did n't drink . 
  but joke aside , they are n't even sure the diners were romanian ( although we ca n't exclude this hypothesis either ) . 
  disappointed by bbc , i thought they had higher standards .
