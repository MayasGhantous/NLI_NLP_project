how about ... not supporting anyone . 
  in that case , one could say your beliefs are wrong . 
  where i work ( which is none of the above mentioned multinationals ) , we have a good number of brits , frenchies , spanish and dutch people . 
  none of them can speak romanian . 
  at least not fluently . 
  we even had a guy from zimbabwe for a couple months . 
  and his name is ... 
   wide spread voter fraud sauce please . 
  you 're wrong . 
  very wrong . 
  i can literally move to the uk tomorrow and i can live there however long i want , as long as i have resources allowing me to do so . 
  no restrictions . 
  you do n't have to be active at all to upvote or downvote . 
  perhaps they like the money they get from people buying shit more than just getting food . 
  it 's like when i tried to give a beggar a sandwich , which he declined because it had mustard . 
  even though he was begging near a food place who served all their sandwiches with mustard . 
  what does you mentioning orange/ft/dt have anything to do with google , a company that operates throughout the whole eu ? 
  i dunno about you , but in romania telecom companies are competing pretty fiercely . 
  uhm ... because that company wants to do business in the eu ... does n't it make sense to you ? 
  because they can ? 
   they might find reasons to sue , ** but unless those reasons are actually backed up by something substantial they 'll lose . 
  ** and that 's wrong how ? 
  he did n't . 
  he got banned from / r/europe ; most likely by that mod that got demoded . 
  yeah ... this ca n't be real ;, 
  i 'll take a wild guess too ; it might have to do with this [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_romani_people#origin ) for example . 
  they may take our jobs , our food , or even our women . 
  but the line has to be drawn somewhere !, 
  we need to rise up , and fight !, 
  do n't ever let them take our good weather !, 
   most of the comments in this thread are [ blablabla ] actually , most of the comments in this thread say something like : `` maybe if i got a really nice job offer , otherwise no thanks '' . 
  only a handful go into detail and say how they hate your stupid culture , your politics , and stupid pieces of shit like you . 
  and it 's funny , cause that polish dude mentioned nationalistic shitheads like you , and he was proven right moments later . 
  if sova is ponta 's right hand , then wtf is dragnea ? 
  mmmm ... 
  you know how you can buy fake ` maple syrup ' ? 
  kinda the same with honey . 
   uk does n't have any control over its borders with regards to eu citizens . 
  this is what you 're saying , and you 're lying . 
  are you stupid ? 
  the uk checks everyone 's passport at entry , including eu citizens . 
  cause how the fuck would they know you 're an eu citizen if they did n't . 
  i believe you 're either very misinformed , or you 're misinforming others on purpose . 
  why were the western , more civilized countries , not able to integrate their muslim minorities better ? 
  the simple fact that at the moment the investigators have no conclusive evidence saying what you 're saying ? 
  past wars ? 
  does n't say much ... especially when most of the other countries hardly spend even the required amount on military . 
  oh look at that ... other countries should accommodate the brits again , while they do n't do anything ... another opt out , but this time from your own citizens ... wonderful, 
  i dunno about you guys , but in romania , there are a couple parliament seats that are meant to represent the diaspora . 
  so voting for governments makes sense . 
  i 'll tell you why : cause even the diaspora has representatives dedicated to it in the parliament , at least in romania . 
  do you even statistics ? 
  if somehow russia ends the civil war that 's been going on in that region ... do we still have to take in as many refugees ? 
  you cared enough to comment on it . 
  but to be fair , you probably are a nobody . 
  the fuck did n't you fuckers do a better job at integrating them then ? 
  show us how it 's done . 
  come on . 
  and do n't turn them into suicide bombers , please . 
  you mean combatants , surely . 
  food is the worst in romania ; when compared to the avg income . 
  that wo n't be around forever . 
  yeah , like , why should anyone help you if you start choking on food ? 
  they should let you die right there . 
  you knew the risks . 
  i believe you ca n't give a tax break to only one company like this . 
   dictator like not if the people want it : https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/european-voters-reject-generous-deal/, 
  the people are all for giving you a shitty deal per some polls . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/european-voters-reject-generous-deal/ and it wo n't be the eu to give you a shitty deal , it will be the eu 's members . 
  just a source here : https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/european-voters-reject-generous-deal/, 
   but unfortunately , we do n't really care comes with the history, 
  why do you even bother breathing when i 'm sure there 's someone better and more successful than you doing it . 
   if your opinion is so rare that none of the current parties shares it , you simply get the shaft . 
  no , you go out and see if anyone else shares it ; then you make a party ; then you become a politician ... boom, 
  if ** you ** lose our business ** you ** potentially lose it forever . 
  like the financial passporting for example . 
  the brits did it ; why should n't we ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that if they start exiting officially , any trade deals will only start being negotiated after they are out . 
   a lot of cities in the uk for example are cleaner than bucharest you know what 's weird though , in the uk ? 
  the total fucking lack of garbage bins !!, 
  i do n't get it ... 
  i mean i kinda do , i heard they 're scared of bombs being placed in them . . but still ... 
  they came back to you after they ran for their lives . 
  good luck . 
  if you 're so not shit , teach us how to integrate the gypsies instead of sterilizing and ethnically cleasing them ; k , thanks , bye !, 
  hey , at least we never did ethnic cleansing the same way swedes did it . 
  i 'm aware , hence why i 'm not the one complaining about my government being shit . 
  shit society  shitty politicians . 
  could n't have . 
  was n't born back then . 
  do n't let the door hit you . 
   look at how many votes ukip got , yet they only got 1 seat . 
  tough fucking luck mate . 
  a couple of years back the same shite people did n't want to change the election method . 
  fucking nigel could n't win his constituency . 
   do n't blame the british people , blame our shite government . 
  but saying as you are irish , i can understand why you hate us . 
  oh please do tell ... who voted on your ` shite ' government ? 
  romanians and bulgarians could n't get work without a work permit for a fair few years . 
  i got my hungarian citizenship just so i could work while i studied in the uk ; for some extra cash .
