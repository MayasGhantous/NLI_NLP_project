history has proven you 're right - in the long term it 's solvable . 
  one of the factors which make this especially difficult is the dissolution of the social bonds and sense of purpose that defines communities as opposed to just a bunch of people who happen to live near each other ( half a century of not being able to trust your neighbor for fear of a remark sending you to jail will take care of that . ), 
  there certainly * is * progress , it 's just maddeningly slow . 
  it 's annoying , for sure . 
  if there were any simple solutions , the problem would have ceased to exist years ago . 
  people are complicated ... 
  you might be on to something here ; it most certainly sports tradition ... 
  unfortunately that would result in the opposite effect , cementing power for the worst specimens of the ruling caste . 
  large swathes of the population are vulnerable to nationalistic propaganda ( mainly due to the communist party 's decades-long careful nurturing of suspicions towards hungary . ), 
  the media apparatus would jump at the occasion of pointing out an evil external influence , poisoning any chances such a candidate would have to make a difference . 
  does n't work , unfortunately . 
  they 're modern vampires - crossbred with hydras . 
  if you get rid of the head one , three more pop up . 
  fyi : you can usually bypass the paywall on many news outlets ( wsj and ft included ) by entering the article url as-is as a google search term and clicking through to the target site * from the google search results page * . 
  using a private browsing / incognito window increases the chances this will work . 
  european unity as envisioned / implied by the un has never existed , and the eu has trudged on ( badly , but still ) . 
  humphrey appleby [ said it best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrn-gkzvyi ) -- as relevant today as it was back in the '80s . 
  no italy either , and i 'm willing to bet it 's for the same reason -- media independence has been eroded too much ( the freedom house site does n't want to render on mobile for me , so i 'm conjecturing , but it 's a fairly safe bet . ), 
  according to the [ corruption perceptions index 2014 study ] ( https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) , corruption perception is very similar in italy and romania . 
  ** edit : ** yup , that 's why . 
  `` partly free . '', 
  it 's not `` eroded too much '' but rather `` never was fully free in the first place '' , though .

  nononononono , $ deity forbid , no , they 're not lies . 
  they 're just clarifications re accidental , potentially equivocal misstatements taken out of context that were issued as personal opinions while being cost-efficient with the truth . 
  yup , that 's the one  my ninja edit muddled the punchline a bit there . 
  that 's true . 
  recognizing that there 's a problem is essential but not sufficient , you have to also * do * something to solve your problems . 
  unfortunately , social cohesion leaves a lot to be desired , so for the time being there 's a lot of navel-gazing involved . 
  there 's progress , but maddeningly slow . 
  aaaand see , i 'm doing it as well , 
  feeds the national pastime of nurturing a victim mentality . 
  it 's a beautifully self-sustaining cycle , 
  true -- what 's life worth without a little whimsy ... , 
   the trick to good passwords is making them long . 
  that 's good advice . 
  however , it 's not worth much if people reuse passwords across different services . 
  a compromise of a single service would then compromise all of them and that 's arguably even worse than easier to guess but different passwords . 
  using a password manager is n't really that much of a hassle and it enables having distinct strong passwords for each service , as long as one has the database backed up properly . 
  [ keepass ] ( http://keepass.info ) is an awesome open source one . 
  but if one were to insist on reusing passwords , one should at the very least segregate services into multiple security tiers , for example : * banking / my money 's in this thing * critical to my identity * not vital but i 'd be annoyed if i lost this * eh , whatever , i 'll make another account and use strong passwords for the important ones . 
  happens  the clip could just as well refer to romania , by the way . 
  perhaps they picked the target alphabetically . 
  now , now . 
  budapest is the capital of * romania * , not bulgaria !, 
  i apologize for taking it somewhat off-topic and a bit too lightly for the seriousness of the matter -- probably should n't have : / i was referencing the fictional book * [ the seventy maxims of maximally effective mercenaries ] ( http://ovalkwiki.com/the+seventy+maxims+of+maximally+effective+mercenaries ) * . 
  `` maxim 29 : the enemy of my enemy is my enemy 's enemy . 
  no more , no less . '', 
  this works for many paywalled sites : copy-paste the exact article url ( e.g. 
  from the address bar , or from the actual link ) into the google search box . 
  the article will probably be the first result . 
  then click through the article * from the google search results page * . 
  this will very often take you to a non-paywalled version of the article . 
  publishers ca n't afford to alienate google-driven traffic . 
  technical explanation : relies on the referer http header coming from google . 
  for bonus points , do that in an incognito / private browsing session , which will prevent the target site from setting cookies and local session data which would restrict your ability to view articles after a few reads ( `` you 've read 5 free articles this month , now cough up '' . ), 
   hey , i actually read the article heresy !, 
   you make it sound like the government ca n't spend any money . 
  sure it can . 
  but in this case * it needs to be appropriated through parliament * . 
  that 's the crux of the matter here . 
  different situation , i 'm afraid  there * are * specific rules for transport infrastructure , especially in domains and geographical areas where it would take massive capital expenditure to build competition so that there 's a de facto natural monopoly . 
  in some situations it 's allowable for * local * government to provide aid to infrastructure that has been deemed critical . 
  in many other cases ( including , repeatedly , for inner city mass transit ) it * did * turn out to be illegal and the money had to be returned . 
  for smaller cities , infractions against state aid prohibition often happen to fly under the radar , too . 
  i 'm sure there are tons of exceptions and special cases -- unfortunately , i 'm not an * expert * here  but none of those situations apply to the state broadcaster ... 
  while unarguably important , it 's * not * a natural monopoly , it 's * not * an area of activity that would exhibit natural entry barriers for competition , and it 's * not * low-key enough to be solved creatively by ignoring the rules ... perhaps even more importantly : even ignoring the eu rules , the ** government ** can not provide relief since the broadcaster is ** not ** under the budgetary authority of government but under that of parliament . 
  as far as is currently known , if anyone in the executive were to authorize payments for this mess , they would be committing misappropriation of funds . 
  they might come up with a legal solution in the end , but that 's for lawyers to decide . 
  my initial reply of `` unlikely '' was meant as a rebuttal of the all-too-common commingling of executive and legislative that many people in my country reflexively commit . 
  whether you can believe it or not is a bit immaterial -- what matters is what the legislation says  the nhs is not a company so the concept of state aid does n't apply and the situation is n't comparable . 
  there are specific rules on state aid for railway transportation ( see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv%3atr0004 for details ) , the situation is n't comparable . 
  no idea about bus transportation since i do n't know the names of any of the entities involved so ca n't search eurlex . 
  just because it 's state-owned does n't mean it can be provided with state aid willy-nilly . 
  the same goes for the bbc . 
  the prohibition on state aid exists because state aid is deemed to distort competition by default . 
   i 'm guessing the government is going to pay their debts again unlikely . 
  that would be state aid , which is generally illegal unless first approved by the european commission . 
  see http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/overview/index_en.html for details . 
  cool , no problem . 
  while they 're on the `` reclaiming our heritage '' page , i 'll assume that they also plan to return [ all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom ) the [ stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure ) they stole from us over the past century or so . 
  verbing weirds language :p, 
   ** january 27 , 2016 **, 
  i guess it 's the same all the world over  describes the `` fourth estate '' ( bah ! ), 
  situation on this end perfectly , with the added bonus of having had the journalistic profession -- sometimes quite literally -- gutted for half a century . 
  i suspect the net pretty much killed any hope there -- it 's go tabloid or go bust . 
  we 'll have to come up with something to somehow tone down the crazy ( for all its faults and oftentimes lack of integrity , traditional media did provide the service of moderation . ), 
   there is a certain kind of reader who associates `` superstate '' with the soviet union , basically . 
  sure . 
  therefore , my point : the article is pure pandering . 
  the subject matter is n't even important to the author -- it could have been about the dangers posed by donkeys mating in the middle of the village road , or any other interchangeable problem . 
  and the fact that it 's so transparent speaks ill of the moral integrity of its author : it 's like he 's not even * trying * to pretend he has respect for the readers ' intellect . 
  by the way , i had no idea who boris johnson was until after i read the article , so -- apart from not having a say in internal british politics in the first place due to being a foreign citizen living in a foreign country -- i do n't think i 'm harboring any particular biases or preconceived notions about him . 
  i 'm just disgusted by the primitiveness of the appeals to emotion used there . 
  perhaps it 's because , as a romanian citizen who grew up during communism , i 'm particularly allergic to blatant manipulation like this . 
  oh , do n't bother . 
  it 's a weak article . 
  apart from the blatantly obvious attempt to manufacture controversy and revelation , what gives away its character as a pure pandering fluff-piece is exactly what is * missing * from the text : it casts this hypothetical superstate as something * a priori * undesirable under any circumstances without even attempting to mention * why * that would be the case . 
  in other words , its audience is expected to already believe its conclusion . 
  there 's always hope !,
