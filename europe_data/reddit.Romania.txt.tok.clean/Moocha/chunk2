  we used to be in that exact same place a few years ago , and there has been staggering progress . 
  even more left to do , but things * can * change !, 
  actually , it would be `` flak '' , not `` flack '' ... , 
  ah , in that case i * completely * misunderstood the point  thanks . 
  wait , the fact that people get to vote for their own representatives as opposed to having someone elsewhere impose them is * a problem * ?!? 
  or have i misunderstood and you mean the pool of representatives from which you get to choose sucks ? 
  * that * problem can not be solved by anyone except you , nobody can magically teleport in better politicians due to the first issue above . 
  sure , but she inarguably wielded enormous influence , hence my nitpick . 
  agreed with virtually every point you listed . 
  second hand nostalgia is even worse when it 's so badly informed . 
  just a small nitpick/oversight :  and concerning high ranking female communists that had influence ? 
  there really were n't that many . 
  the only one i can think of is ana pauker and that 's it . 
  in 45 years of communism rule , that is n't much . 
  uh , you kinda sorta forgot about the nation 's first daughter \u2122 , academician doctor engineer bitch queen supreme , 
  i know , right ?

  who knew it could backfire ? 
  but [ what ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ ) about [ mars ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/54/ ) ? 
  i think the actual question is whether the ** complete ** energy use of the entire chain ( manufacturing , packaging , shipping , distributon , use , and disposal ) has gone down . 
  considering the cfl 's more complex structure and potential polluting residues , and given that the lifetime for most bulbs falls far short of what we were promised , i do n't think that 's a given . 
  i 'd be very interested in seeing reliable estimates . 
  * thank you . 
  * i 'm sick and tired of cheap appeals to emotion , playing on people 's fears . 
  besides ignoring reason , they literally feel * cheap * , like no effort was even worth expending to sell the idea . 
  and that , of course , makes people suspicious and defensive -- and rightly so . 
   an extra $ 240 for every man , woman and child in the eu every year for the rest of time . 
  you ca n't just dismiss that as chump change . 
  i can * trivially * dismiss that as chump change even coming from one of the poorest eu countries , just given the very questionable patent legislation changes we 've seen so far . 
  i 'm not willing to sell off my future development prospects that cheaply . 
  look up the concept of opportunity cost . 
  ** be quiet !,

  romania 's in the same boat ... to the extent that the phrasing '' _ [ public ] authorities were taken by surprise by this year 's unexpected winter snowfall _ '' has achieved the same status in public media catchphrase perception like * yes minister * 's '' _ the pound had another bad day _ '' bbc joke . 
  pensions are not salaries . 
  similarly , salaries are income but not all income constitute salaries . 
  that 's why your above statement was misleading . 
  it might be a good idea to edit it to clarify , 
  2700 lei is most certainly not the median , way too high . 
  iirc , the official average figure was around 1800-ish , and the median will likely be less than that due to the comparatively high number of people still working in rural areas in low wage domains such as agriculture . 
  the median should lie somewhere between minimum wage and the official average ( discounting unreported wages since there are no reliable estimates for that . ), 
   this is 2700 romanian lei , almost triple the ** real ** average salary in romania . 
  i think you mean median , not average . 
  yup . 
  in technical terms , they check the http referrer header ; if it 's originating from google , they let you through the paywall . 
  they do set some cookies by which they check how many articles you 've viewed per month etc , which is why a private browsing window will help ( since it wo n't send back or store any such cookies past the current browsing session . ), 
  yup , that 's why it 's at zero . 
  please note that this is not a poll on popular opinion ; the figures represent support from the ** meps ** from the corresponding countries , and since ireland has the military opt-out it * must * legally be zero . 
  yup . 
  and the `` so far '' is prophetic ...

   fallback to wto rules and trade tariffs , actually , no , not even that . 
  [ the uk is a wto member as part of the eu ] ( https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/united_kingdom_e.htm ) with some gatt grandfathered in , so most of the wto framework would * not * automatically apply .

  lower cargo transport costs . 
  i understand where the argument is coming from , but that logic ends in infinite regression : had the us financial system not triggered the 2007 crisis , the euro crisis might not have happened , or might not have been / be as bad . 
  had the clinton administration not continued reagan 's deregulation policies , had bush jr stayed away from iraq , had deutsche bank not renounced the great concordium style of doing business , had , had , shoulda coulda oughta right back to gilgamesh . 
  i know this makes no material difference for someone still suffering the effects of 2007/2008 , but it still irks me that people so easily conflate proximity and causality . 
   polls suggest the royal family is the most trusted institution in romania wait , what ? 
  i would very much like to see the results of any such polls conducted by a respected polling institution . 
  otherwise , i call bs . 
  but that 's very much ** not ** the same question . 
  at * all * . 
  the survey question does n't diferentiate between a defensive and a non-defensive war . 
  yup . 
  but , unlike other banks who have managed to quietly flog off all the toxic assets onto the back of the tax payers , db seems to have been sleeping on the job -- and in a game of musical chairs it 's vital to move quickly ... 
  i remember reading an interesting article about db 's change of strategy somewhere a few months ago ( it seemed to be a bit light on sources / more of an opinion piece , but smelled relatively credible . ), 
  i 'll see if i can dig it up . 
  ** ninja edit : ** found it : https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/24/deutsche-bank-uber-alles/ -- use a high concentration of sodium chloride since it 's fp , but worth the read , i think . 
  ahh , did n't read up on those yet . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  still , i think there is cause for concern even if only the us unit were the only shaky one . 
  db has been gradually abandoning their decades-old grand concordium style of doing business in the last decade and a half in favor of a us-style investment bank approach , so i think the us unit can legitimately be regarded as a soundness proxy for the future . 
  actually , no , they did not : http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0zg0dm ( sorry about the mobile link , on mobile right now , 
  indeed . 
  this stuff must have been established technique back when we left the caves ... 
  true . 
  but the * impact * of those costs will very obviously be disproportionately felt by poorer households who often live on a razor thin margin between income and expenses , since consumer expenses do not fall as quickly as income does : a 5 % reduction in income can be catastrophic for someone who barely scrapes by but not very relevant for a high income household . 
  i hope the uk will put together measures to help low income households in the wake of this ... 
  a lifetime might not be enough to be done with this ... 
  but we could be persuaded to look into cloning and memory transfer technology ... , 
  yup , it was deliberate .

  well done !, 
  * tips hat *, 
  oh , zerohedge has definitely published some good stuff !, 
  it 's just that the wheat is interspersed with a ton of chaff ( usually the weekly questionable predictions about yet another recession/depression/whatever ) so it 's really , really annoying to fact-check them .
