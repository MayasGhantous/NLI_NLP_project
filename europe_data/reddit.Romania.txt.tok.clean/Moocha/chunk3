  they also love to take quotes out of context , veering dangerously close to yellow journalism . 
  the pseudonymity of the bloggers does n't help either  ** edit : ** forgot : te is often paywalled , i think that 's why ... 
  it 's zerohedge ; assessing information from there critically involves risking a fatal sodium chloride poisoning ... 
  oops . 
  our bad . 
  indeed . 
  especially given that the * best case * scenario right now is a two-speed europe ( a * worst case * scenario just 5 years ago . ), 
  there might be ways . 
  the eu could figure out a way to make the treaty termination provisions of the [ 1969 vienna convention of the law of treaties ] ( http://www.oas.org/legal/english/docs/vienna%20convention%20treaties.htm ) work , even if it is meant to apply only to treaties between states , not between states and international organizations , and even if france and romania are n't signatories . 
  but even if ( and i 'd have to stress the if ! ), 
  that would work , it definitely would n't be quick . 
  i 'm personally not set on taking too seriously what * anyone * is saying for the first couple of weeks or so ; it 's a waste of time . 
  i 'm sure that many people will adopt positions quite distant from their usual outlook . 
  this is a matter too grave to be handled while emotions are running high -- this needs to be handled pragmatically , after everyone 's stopped running around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off . 
   what totalitarian bullshit is this ? 
  is it only democracy when you agree with the decision ? 
  it 's hilarious coming from a romanian how democracy should n't be trusted , i 'm sure all those years of one party rule really helped guide the people well nice ad hominem you did there , and also thanks . 
  it might interest you to know that / u/professionalwil is british . 
  that 's not to say i agree with his position , mind you . 
  but your reaction was inappropriate . 
  they make a whole lot of sense . 
  do n't assume they 're stupid or arrogant ; they 're not ( or not in the sense you might believe . ), 
  they 're simply laying the groundwork so that later , when it goes to shit , they can point back and cry about the evil eu screwing them when they were clearly open to negotiating in the first place , boo hoo , we 're all you 've got , vote for us . 
  celebrating pyromania for shits and giggles is n't something to be * proud * of . 
  at least not for adults . 
  i can respect the opinion of someone who actually believes the bullshit trump espouses ( even if i then ca n't respect their intellect too much ) , but trolling is n't opinion , it 's just ... trolling . 
   at any rate , i 'd pay good money to see the look on the faces of the people who just `` went along with the joke '' after trump wins ... 
  a decision is * only * ever democratic if the results align with your beliefs and only has consequences which benefit you under all circumstances now and forever amen , did n't you know ? 
   someone described / r/europe as being to the eu what / r/the _ donald is to donald trump , and i think that 's rather accurate . 
  i ** strongly ** disagree . 
  while the hivemind effect is most certainly real , there 's a * qualitative * difference between this subreddit and that one , and it 's expressed in the most minute things , not only in the level of discourse ... / r/europe even links to / r/eurosceptics in its sidebar ; i do n't see / r/the _ donald extending the same courtesy to opposing viewpoints . 
  ceau\u0219escu and the curent kim jong version had much in common , among which a predilection for megalomaniac projects with little economic value ... 
  it 's almost as relevant nowadays as it was back in thatcher 's days  humphrey could be any senior civil servant in any modern bureaucracy ...

  so far i do n't think people really know . 
  he ran the interim / caretaker government after ponta 's fall up to the legislative elections in december on a platform of political neutrality and specifically without any sort of explicit parliamentary support , so it largely stayed out of political decisions . 
  he would ** _ probably _ ** ( !!, 
  - utter speculation on my part , based on hints and inferences ! ), 
  lean slightly towards the latter , so , in theory , center-right , but we have _ very _ little data to go on . 
  ** ninja edit : ** _ classical _ center-right , mind you , not 2016 center-right ( the definitions in current use seem to have shifted a _ lot _ towards the right . ), 
  they 're not ** his ** votes to give . 
  he can certainly _ request _ that his voters cast their votes in favor of another specific candidate , but that does n't automatically mean they will do so . 
  if what he asks runs contrary to his initial premise , a significant portion of his potential voters will likely ignore him . 
  probably better suited for / r/askeurope ... 
   coming from / r/all . 
  do you get a flag automatically when you post a comment ? 
   edit : nope , it 's user flair . 
  why is n't there a usa flag ? 
  um , there is one . 
  look ** more ** closelier  it 's fully spelled out instead of just the acronym . 
   can someone explain the england one ? 
  `` the falklands belong to argentina . '', 
  trump is a zero-sum cannibal ; his modus operandi precludes a win-win . 
  he has repeatedly stated this in unambiguous terms in his books . 
  if anyone harbors illusions of a mutually beneficial deal with him , they 'll be in for a rude awakening . 
  nitpicking an oversight , but : technocratic , not theocratic , 
  i actually feel bad that you took the time to detail a cogent argument about this :( wasted effort in the face of a closed mind . 
  the person to which you replied is from the `` burn it all down '' camp , untouchable by objective reality . 
  that being said , your reply is spot on . 
  why thank you , it 's nice to be hated with such a forceful brush . 
  really makes me want to buy uk products and services . 
  i got a headache trying to parse that sentence . 
  well , if farage claimed that , i think it 's safe to say that the truth is that the eu employs a lot of translators . 
  mostly because farage 's statements are usually not even wrong . 
  speculation : brexit and trump happened in the meanwhile , possibly leading people to reassess their positions and/or motivating stay-at-home voters to vote . 
  `` this video is not available . '', 
  neither , because it does n't measure ** results ** , just expenditure . 
  you ca n't work miracles without a minimum budget , but it 's also easily possible to waste funds . 
  in the form it was posted , this data set allows for neither simplistic good/bad conclusions , nor for any opinion based in reality ( let alone for comparison between the countries ) ; it 's rather pointless . 
  yup . 
  and romania is one of the most religious countries ( arguably more in observance than belief , but still . ), 
  there 's another aspect he seems to have missed : research costs . 
  at that point in time there were many low hanging fruit left in the physical sciences ( which also happened to have direct application into the military field ) , and the capital requirements for that research were tiny in comparison to the possibilities of a small funding organization , and the feudal system made it easy to extract capital from the economy . 
  this type of research nowadays is incredibly expensive for smaller entities and requires transnational cooperation . 
  do n't bother , they 're just one of the regular low-effort trolls  was bored and decided to trigger them -- not proud of it because it was in _ turn _ low-effort entertainment , but it 's nice to every so often verify these people are just as easy to manipulate as ever and are n't getting any smarter . 
  in that , we agree . 
  ooooh boy , i sure done got put down by your marvellous command of rhetoric and the accuracy of your facts . 
  how shall i ever go on living . 
  yeah , you know , it really makes your point believable when you spout random `` facts '' that even on a cursory look turn out to be bullshit . 
  romania has one of the lowest debt to gdp ratios in the eu . 
  um , it 's ** _ satire _ ** , and skewers stereotypes about both countries . 
  the _ whoosh _ must have been _ deafening _ ... 
   in that sense the electoral college did exactly what it was designed to do : it stopped the numerical dominance of coastal states to determine the election . 
  that 's not what it was designed to do -- it 's provably false with a trivial thought experiment : 1 . 
  move the entire population of the us into a single state -- say , texas 2 . 
  except leave a single person in each of the other states . 
  let candidate a win in texas , and candidate b win in * every single one * of the other states . 
  candidate a will win the election . 
  since texas will then have unilaterally decided the election , we have proven that there exists some population threshold , somewhere between 1 and the number of registered voters in the us minus 49 , at which this mythical safeguard falls apart . 
  it 's not necessary to find out that number , since it ** must ** exist , by the above demonstration and the compactness of the set of natural numbers . 
  now , since we can safely assume the designers of the us constitution were n't naive idiots , they must have seen this weakness , and they must have taken into account the possibility of population imbalances ( in fact , _ one existed right from the start _ , in favor of the east coast . ), 
  the logical conclusion is then that `` stopping the numerical dominance of coastal states '' was ** not ** a design consideration for the electoral college . 
  oooh , nice catch !, 
  tsk , man 's never heard of the concept of self-plagiarizing ... 
  the opposite . 
  stop the circumventions . 
  and yes , i know that it 's a nuanced issue , and i know it 's a very difficult ask . 
  agreed , and , for what it 's worth , they 're an utter mess everywhere ... 
  the us is in the same situation , they 're being eluded en masse ( e.g.
