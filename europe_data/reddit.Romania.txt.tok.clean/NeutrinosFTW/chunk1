get with the times bruh, 
  when i hear the term `` partial job '' that 's what i think of , and it 's true , there are many people who have them that would n't otherwise be employed . 
  as far as i know , there is n't a program that works like the one he was describing , but if he was in fact referring to those jobs , then i do n't know why he thought they were n't real . 
  there are a lot of partial jobs , sure , but they 're only subsidized in the sense that you do n't pay taxes on the income ( so a sort off `` workers ' subsidy '' , if that makes any sense ) . 
  if you earn less than 450 euro a month it 's considered a partial job , but the private sector does n't get any economic incentive for hiring people into those jobs . 
  i 'm with you on that . 
  it 's belgium 's own fault really . 
  i 'm not sure this sub could handle the [ sheer awesome . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afl9wfgje0m ), 
  and pedophiles . 
   unless you guys strike oil . 
  that 's such an american thing to say . 
  yeah , but the cost of living is also a lot higher in ireland . 
  not to mention unemployment is nearly twice as high in ireland ( about 11 % ) than in the czech republic . 
  i know it sounds a bit far-fetched , but the truth is the czech economy is currently doing better than the irish economy . 
  ireland was pretty heavily affected by the economic crisis , and their severe austerity measures put a lot of people at risk of poverty . 
  the czech republic recovered pretty well , a lot better than ireland did anyway . 
  i hope for your sake you do n't . 
  well , we did better than the russians , that 's got to count for something . 
  i think it was oscar wilde who once said `` life is too short to learn german '' . 
  as someone who speaks german as a second language i could n't agree more . 
  i thought corruption was our thing . 
  what the fuck hungary ? 
  the fact that politicians get prosecuted is tremendous news . 
  corruption 's been happening since forever . 
  the fact that they 're now getting caught is new and exciting . 
  you can also add as many * dup\u0103 * 's ( after ) as you like . 
  example : dup\u0103 r\u0103spoim\u00e2ine ( the day after the day after the day after tomorrow ) dup\u0103 dup\u0103 r\u0103spoim\u00e2ine ( the day after the day after the day after the day after tomorrow ) etc. 
  people rarely do it because it 's retarded , but i did it all the time as a kid . 
  and because he was n't accepted as an arts student in vienna , he became a soldier for germany . 
  thanks a lot , austria . 
  yup , you 're probably right , i just really ca n't help myself from quoting that one south park episode . 
  i do it every chance i get . 
  as of course is tradition . 
  nope , not really . 
  schengen has nothing to do with it . 
  you can literally wake up tomorrow , pack your things and leave for western europe , without as much as a how do you do . 
  aww yiss . 
  seriously guys . 
  do you want isis to find out about us ? 
  this seems a bit over-the-top to me . 
  i 'm not saying it 's false , because i do n't have the data to back that up . 
  but the article says the issue will be discussed on `` romania , te iubesc !, 
  '' , which is a tv show that tackles stuff like this . 
  the thing is they 're very scandalous , and more often than not they exaggerate , and sometimes even flat-out lie in order to sound interesting . 
  take this with a grain of salt is what i 'm saying . 
  agreed . 
  i 'd actually be a bit disappointed if anyone thought higher of me because of it . 
  thank you . 
  that 's exactly what i was going for . 
  ... maybe you could give it to us ? 
   but it has sparked criticism , with both eu and u.s. opponents claiming that ttip may give too much power to corporations , especially foreign investors , and that it could undermine food safety and environmental standards , lowering u.s. chemical regulations and forcing europeans to consume genetically-modified american foods and chlorinated chickens . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/ ) if these concerns are based in reality i would n't really blame the germans for not wanting it . 
  can confirm , asked 6 year old cousin , he said it was a great argument . 
  it 's weird how reddit makes me cry and smile with a single post . 
  oh my god , go fuck yourself so hard . 
  seriously . 
  you have to meet certain requirements to join the eurozone . 
  greece had not met these requirements when it signed up for the eurozone , but they made it look as if they had . 
  this is entirely on them . 
  i really hope [ varoufakis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afl9wfgje0m ) does n't come after me for this . 
  hey that 's not fair , neither are they !, 
  ^ ^ ^ they 're ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ their ^ ^ ^ way ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ radical ^ ^ ^ fascism . 
  `` the cunt went off charging across the tussocks '' `` fuck your mother , not again '' . 
  i think i 'd get used to living in russia just fine . 
  i always thought `` ich glaube ich spinne '' was weird as hell . 
  whenever i heard it i thought i spider . 
  our base is your mother 's cunt too . 
  `` du-te-n pizda ma-tii '' ( go to your mother 's cunt ) is definitely our all-time favorite . 
  that 's the strongest bond between two peoples that i can think of . 
  well you should , you 're really missing out . 
   we 're planning to fight the government by defiantly playing board games and eating pizza . 
  now that 's my kind of protest, 
  lyrics from that singer :  here i go , it 's coming for me ** through the trees ** yeah , i do n't see it . 
  romania did fulfill the chapters . 
  we had been trying to get in for years , and had worked towards that the entire time . 
  i do n't know about bulgaria , but i 'm guessing it 's the same there . 
  not yet , he 's still an mp , and they have immunity . 
  there are going to be legislative elections next year , and judging by the current state of affairs he 's very unlikely to get a seat in the parliament . 
  but if we 're lucky he 's going to lose immunity and be prosecuted by then anyway . 
   the only reliable and fair partner of romania for the past 25 years has been the us i mean i have nothing against the us , but i see literally no reason why that would be the case . 
  well fuck . 
   wrong country u fokin wut m8, 
  you 're right , but i 'd really like to point out that the bit about eastern europeans abandoning pride to accept help from the eu is n't what we do at all . 
  i 'm glad to be a part of a european community and a european citizen at that . 
  the financial benefits my country gets from the eu do n't in any way , shape or form affect how i feel about it or the eu as a whole . 
  `` takes a certain lack of pride '' my ass . 
  it takes a certain amount of nationalistic narcissism to say that . 
  that 's the most depressing thing i 've ever heard, 
  oh i realize that , it was your president who suggested america had a negative gdp . 
  unless ... [ uhm ... you add countries with negative gdps ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-gdp-never-negative-ter/ ) . 
  hmm so let 's see : - corrupt assholes - corrupt and/or incompetent assholes - they 're alright i guess but ca n't do shit - corrupt assholes - corrupt assholes - corrupt assholes - useless assholes so much variety on the romanian political scene . 
  loving every minute of it :(, 
  i 'll start off . 
  a romanian does n't get shitfaced drunk , he makes himself boogers ( `` a te face muci '' ) 2 . 
  in romania you do n't overreact , you make a stallion out of a mosquito ( `` a face din tantar armasar '' ) 3 . 
  in romania you do n't waste time , you fuck the owl ( `` a fute buha '' ) let 's hear yours . 
  note : i got the idea from [ here ] ( http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/24-funniest-romanian-expressions/ ) , there are a few more romanian ones there . 
  which is the best kind of western . 
  i think it 's good to separate somewhat corrupt/inefficient judicial systems from completely non-existent ones .
