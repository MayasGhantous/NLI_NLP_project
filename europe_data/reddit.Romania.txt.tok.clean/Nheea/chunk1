he did n't break his neck though . 
  iliescu screwed us , but it does n't mean that before him r moldova did n't want to be independent , especially from russia . 
  at least that 's what we learned in history classes . 
  and please , do n't twist your words into sounding like the whole romania wanted what iliescu did . 
  yes , he was corrupted . 
  but he is n't `` us '' . 
  indeed , there 's no eu problem , i was wrong about that . 
  but bad for both ? 
  i am not confirming nor denying that . 
  we need a deep analysis to be sure of that . 
   they were the ones that wanted the separation . 
  they were the ones that wanted their own language . 
  that 's true , indeed . 
   why should we let them back now that they hit rock bottom ? 
  i disagree with this though . 
  also , it 's not like they 're coming back crawling . 
  read about this though , maybe you 'll change a bit of your point of view : http://adevarul.ro/economie/investitii/daca-unim-republica-moldova-iesim-profit-1_534e5d7b0d133766a8d63b3b/index.html the actual problem is now that russia kind of `` forbid '' them and maybe us , from reuniting , so that 's an alarm signal to say at least for both of us . 
  sooo . . apparently not . 
  i was mistaken . 
  for a while . 
  that 's a real concern indeed . 
  but think of it this way : better to have them with us and than against us because russia got to them first . 
  anyway , this is all theoretical . 
  my point is that your comment sounded troll . . ish . 
  if i were a moldavian , i would find it offensive . 
  not really . 
  it 's just unachievable right now . 
  not because we do n't want it , but because r of moldova is not an eu member yet and we actually are n't allowed to reunite with them . 
  even if we wanted to . 
  edit : i was wrong about what i previously said . 
  there 's no law that forbids us a union . 
  do n't troll please . 
  it 's the pro russians who reject that idea from what i learned from a few moldavian friends . 
  yeah what the fuck is happening in portugal ? 
  it was the first thing that catched my eye . 
  what is * that * ? 
   ps : i heard a lot of people around me joking about `` we all are nation traitors and enemies of the russian people '' . 
  like , we 're a `` fifth column '' and that queue was barely moving because the cops had to check the id and make a photo , in order to make it easier to find us in the future . 
  it was weird but funny . 
  wow that 's horrible :( i 'm still very proud of you all for not backing down . 
  no wonder this brainless prime-minister keeps coming and going from turkey . 
  he loves erdogan . 
  yeah , also they have a lot of money to travel other ways , with guns too , not only with a backpack with some pita bread and a few clothes . 
  not if you 're a muslim or coloured , trust me . 
  you should head over to / r/romania and see the racism , xenophobia and islamophobia over there . 
  i remember a few weeks ago , when the threads about immigrants started , you could see comments like : `` shoot them '' , `` they 're gon na bring terrorists '' , `` they 're gon na try to convert us '' . 
  and it ' still going . 
  i 'm ashamed of my fellow romanians who think this way . 
  because it 's bullshit , that 's why . 
  a lot of factories are closing because they 're not turning profit . 
  a lot of their workers even protested because they are out of jobs . 
  mind you , people who had experience . 
  you ca n't assume every refugee will be able to work in it or in a factory . 
  nice logical fallacy you have over there . 
  i think it 's called a slippery slope . 
  maybe you should stop with the ignorance and ad hominem arguments . 
  they already said there are no civilians in there and that they 're doing this as a defensive , not as offensive tactics . 
   like i said , it 's not the rules of reddit , but of life . 
  yeah , what rules ? 
  the rules of getting bombed and not fighting back ? 
   you know that you ca n't fight back without using fuckin ' bombs , right ? 
  oh look , a redditor tells others how to fight back in a war . 
  unbelievable . 
   let 's sent fuckin ' bombs into this motherfck3r country !, 
  ( it does n't matter if some civilian dies , the important thing is that the dikhead got blow up too ) you completely ignored op 's and others ' comments then where he says which site is bombed and why . 
  how about a little bit of knowledge before saying that they bomb civilians ? 
   everybody knows that many armies use civilians as human shields `` oh look , i 'm supporting my statements without having/knowing the whole story . '', 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ajxfl/when_war_comes_to_reddit_rukraina_sends_a_hello/csdag9e http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ajxfl/when_war_comes_to_reddit_rukraina_sends_a_hello/csdf3ue next time , get your context together before assuming stuff and that they 're bombing civilians . 
  and do n't think that anyone is praising war just because . 
  i doubt that many of them even will come back alive or in one piece and they know it . 
  do you think these people want that ? 
  nobody wants that . 
  they have to do it though . 
  they ca n't all flee the country and give in to russia . 
   reddit banned the `` fat people hate '' because it was an incentive to joke around fat people . 
  neah , it 's because they broke the site rules . 
  like you know , harassing people . 
  otherwise , other subreddits like fph would 've been banned too because of the content . 
   the rules of humanity , not reddit . 
  what rule are they actually breaking by posting this ? 
  like someone already said : it becomes even more real when some guys you know from the internet join the army . 
  do you they they wanted to go there instead of browsing reddit in their free time ? 
  do you think they want to kill anyone ? 
  who do you see here that is `` praying for the war '' ? 
  are you serious ? 
  i guess when someone comes in your own home and hits you and throws bombs at you , you just say : `` neah dude , i 'm against war , i wo n't fight back !, 
   it 's not being invaded . 
  yeah , tell that to my ukrainian friends who moved to my country because the city where they lived was destroyed by those invaders . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  and what do you suggest ? 
  that they give up and take it in ? 
  i do n't see how you can avoid a war that 's happening in your country , without your will . 
  what should they do ? 
  just accept being invaded ? 
  it 's called empathy !, 
  `` end in peace '' . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  as if they would n't want that ? 
  are you that oblivious to what 's happening there ? 
  i do n't think so .
