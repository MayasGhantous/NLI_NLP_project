well , you know , after you miss the first party where everyone got some [ land ] , you really really want to go to the next one . 
   nice one . 
  a recent opinion poll showed that romanians have a very very positive view of spain ( it might have scored first in the world ) . 
  my answer is regarding this from a few posts over mine . 
  in romania there 's a very big class divide , but it 's different then the classic sense . 
  there 's upper and middle on one side , and lower on the other . 
  the lower side , due to lack of economic means , educated or well informed entourage , opportunities or really choice tend to develop a different way of thinking and acting . 
  they 're often impulsive and tend to hate the country that gave them nothing ( ro ) and praise to no end the country where they earn a bigger wage ( it , es , uk ) . 
  they come home and tell everybody about a country made of marble where money grows on trees and how they ( the listener ) too can make 1000e out of picking strawberries from the field for 60h/week . 
  everybody and their grandma would not have a `` very very positive '' view on most countries if they took 2 hours out of their lives to research the current and historical relations between them and us . 
  i mean , in all fairness , why would romanians like spain more than belarus ? 
  i 'm not anti-spain or something , but if you ask the people who answer the poll `` why is spain better than belgium '' they 'd ask what the fuck is a belgium . 
  edit : they should filter the people who answer these polls about europe . 
  ask basic questions beforehand `` what are the countries in europe ? 
  can you place half of them on a map ? '', 
  if you ca n't answer kindergarten level questions then your * opinion is as valuable as my dog 's . 
  * `` your '' refers to the poll respondent , not yours as in a reader of this . 
  why did n't romania join the first balkan war ? 
  that 's actually a very good question . 
   romanians have a very very positive view of spain makes me laugh every time . 
  maybe it 's `` why do poles do n't beat ** their ** kids '' . 
  leave our kids alone , poles !, 
  foreign image is relevant only regarding external investments and tourism . 
  investments are n't a problem at the moment , tourism has way bigger problems than lack of foreign interest . 
  on the other hand , going from a state where nepotism and corruption exist but can be prosecuted to a state where nepotism is encouraged and corruption on the part of the crown can not be legally charged is , in my opinion at least , dumb . 
  in the end , i care very little if the dude that thinks kangaroos are from austria thinks that romania is somewhere near french guyana . 
  i care about the college educated dude who started a business or is an employee of a big company . 
  the first one because he might be interested to move production or to outsource , the other because he 's been to spain before and he 's tired of france and is looking for something or somewhere he 's never seen/been . 
  i can understand the idea that `` they all let us down '' , but that 's not a reason to not vote , or at least consider every candidate when it 's voting time and decide then if there 's a point in voting . 
   in my opinion it 's true we are severly lacking good politicians that show they have a degree of backbone it 's true , at least part of it is . 
  while this is the way the problem appears , it 's more the fact that if a `` good '' guy comes into a group of 50 `` bad '' guys , he will either get ignored or silenced . 
  this particular problem is very hard to solve , as you usually need a big influx of `` the other guys '' , one individual at a time will increase the pool of `` bad '' over time , rather than fix it step by step . 
  it 's not . 
  if it comes to a vote monarchy would maybe get 5 % . 
  the royal family is not popular . 
  i mean , they 're `` those nice old people with the nice house who take part in that official dinner once a year , i think '' monarchy , in itself , is popular between people who : 1 . do n't understand the concept , or 2 . 
  consider hereditary rule is a great idea . 
  not choosing representatives worked great in communism , after all . 
  have no understanding of politics , and consider that : ** a. 
  ** giving full power to one dude is a good idea ** b. 
  ** giving full power to parliament is a great idea ** c. ** ( most importantly maybe ) this has worked well in the past , so it should work amazingly now . 
  it did n't work well in the past , it wo n't work now . 
  i found that people who answer `` they 're all the same '' tend to be really ** really ** simple minded . 
  most of them do n't know shit about politics and just want to add to the conversation with the laziest answer possible . 
  ask them `` who would be good if not them and why ? '' . 
  if they come up with some historical political figure or some guy who 's known for upstanding qualities or former success and they follow that up with competent logic then they 're not idiots , even if the choice is debatable . 
  if they say some retarded line like `` they all steal and we 're poor because of them '' you should never mention politics around them again . 
  we 're trying , but then again , we have a lot of bullets and a lot of feet . 
  transnistria is another story completely . 
  there 's no way to annex that region . 
  let it become a failed state and let it 's population be miserable until they learn to play nice . 
  russia ca n't and wo n't ever annex them , but they 're blind . 
  one thing you learn early when studying this specific branch of law is that you do n't go after the biggest fish , but after those who leave the biggest trail . 
  edit : i 'm not saying you avoid the biggest fish , just that the size of it is irrelevant . 
  it 's not their fault they 've been kept uneducated . 
  if you talk with moldavian college students , even those who go to moscow at uni , they will all say moldova has failed and there is a dire need for change . 
  russia ca n't annex them , they just could n't handle it at this point in time , so the only option is romania . 
  but , even if unpopular , do we really want the annexation ? 
  is is worth the trouble ? 
  if they truly feel like brothers why do n't they move here ? 
  there are ** plenty ** of villages that offer free housing and land . 
  the ones from the city can come and work at factories in for triple their wage . 
  of course you do n't want to work in assembly after finishing law school , but if you can barely pay the bills , do you really need to question it ? 
  you can always count on uneducated people to vote based on politically unrelated stuff . 
  i remember a conversation in a bus between two old ladies , one saying '' i 'll never vote for tariceanu now , how can you vote for someone who got divorced 4 times ? '', 
  [ obligatory link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sizivcj9pzu ), 
  she was part of a shady deal involving some land a few years back . 
  apart from that , she kept a fairly low profile , especially in recent years . 
  i may not be the best at answering this though , i never took her seriously . 
  ( not because she 's a joke , but because she never did something to catch my eye ), 
  i ^ almost completely agree , sans the conviction . 
  i would n't be so sure he 'll get away if he is , indeed , guilty . 
  romania is on an upwards trend . 
  former presidents always fall in popularity after their term ends in these situations , as most think he had his shot , regardless of the outcome . 
  also , basescu is regarded as one of the old school politicians and people tend to remember the bad rather than the good . 
  you will see his true popularity if he actually tries for the mayor of bucharest office again . 
  he wo n't get many votes if he does , he 'll prove my point if he does n't . 
  i know very few people aged 18-40 who would vote for him . 
  do n't forget that a good part of votes are often anti-the-other-guy , rather than for the person voted . 
  ( this is regarding the terms he got ), 
  who he is and * how he is perceived * are two very different things . 
  who you are is irrelevant when running for office . 
  that would complicate things a lot , but that 's a long way from this point and money laundering does not lead to very long trials or investigations , as making such a claim regarding someone with public notoriety is backed 99 % of the time by conclusive evidence . 
  it would in a indirect way . 
  basescu is anything but popular in romania at the moment , so romania 's position regarding the relation will likely remain the same , but , on the other hand , moldovans , * if he would n't get convicted , would gain citizenship , would run for the seat and would win * , should see this as getting closer to the west rather than russia and * if * basescu actually is n't a bad choice for them over the years they should be inclined towards strengthening relations even more with us . 
  a lot of * if 's * and * should 's *, 
  [ they do ] ( http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;lang=1&amp;id=313530 ) art . 
  sadly , he might still be better than what they currently have in rep. moldova . 
  russian is extremely rare . 
  a few years ago there were some news of interest from moscow to fund some public schools if they would include russian as a foreign language . 
  do n't know if that materialized . 
  spanish can be taken in a few highschools in bucharest , but i guess that 's the full extent of it . 
  portuguese and italian , at least to my knowledge , can be taken in maybe 1 or 2 highschools . 
  there are some specific universities where you can study most if not any language you would want , but we 're talking about optional education here . 
  most common third language is french , then german . 
  usually you start your second language in primary ( 1st-4th grade , 7-11 y/o ) and your third in 5th grade , and one year of latin in 8th . 
  so you would get 2 classes / week ( 1h each ) for your second language and 1hr/week for your third in a regular non-intensive class or specialized school . 
  it was a clarification for those who do n't know . 
  while i 'm sure any romanian would understand that `` there are prostitutes '' is not part of the saying , it 's because we 're familiar with it . 
  it could 've created confusion for others , especially with the human trafficking problem there is in the east .
