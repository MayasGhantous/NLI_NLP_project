  that 's not really the case . 
  while sex is taboo at that age , it 's not viewed as a sin . 
  there are loads of contraceptives , and they are n't ** that ** expensive . 
  sexual education is lacking , true . 
  plan b exists and it 's like 11eur . 
  abortions are frowned upon but they are , at least in the first moths , cheap ( 100-200eur ) or even free . 
  who exactly are these friends you 're talking about ? 
  we 're not weak as fuck . 
  there 's nothing to defend against at this point . 
  who 'll attack us ? 
  hungary ? . 
  there 's no value in territory in this century , especially from russia . 
  you think russia invaded ukraine for farm land ? 
  they have no business in or through romania . 
  there 's a bigger chance of bulgaria attacking us , and we have a better military than them . 
  we have 2 planes and they have 1 , i doubt any of them work , but still , we got 'em . 
  this should be called : `` what european country does your country like this month ? 
  - may 2016 '' / r/dataisbeautiful could gather info from the 60 identical posts in the last 5 years . 
  now ** that ** would be a study to read , 0 % fluctuation on a medium term is as rare as a left-wing ~ ~ polish ~ ~ chinese politician . 
  lack of education is their problem . 
  sadly , they had no choice . 
  leaving school to work the field was a necessity some decades ago . 
  this is n't a romanian specific problem though , it 's a problem in most countries . 
  not by all the population . 
  while the people in major cities and regions around them do live better from year to year , those in the rural areas and most of the moldova region feel like nothing has changed in the last 10 years or so . 
  everyone knows we 're doing way better than we did in 2000 or 1990 but not everyone can see that that 's also true when you compare to 2007 or 2012 ( before-after recession ), 
  if those fall , we 'll build others . 
  building stuff costs money . 
  so you basically want to pay more taxes , taxes that they 'll use to rebuild the buildings destroyed . 
   gib back clay ...  [ ... ] ** back ** [ ... ] ... 
  triggered, 
  now that this is settled , my cousin is selling his '82 bmw e30 , i might be able to convince him to sell it to you for 3000 $ since we 're friends , but you 'd have to pay cash and do n't ask many questions . 
  not that there 's something wrong with the car , my cousin is just sensitive . 
  4 % is quick . 
  you just named the problem - infrastructure . 
  education is decent . 
  there is a lot of corruption related to infrastructure but i expect it to get cleaned up in the following years, 
  bulgarians steal cars from france , we steal from germany . 
  check your facts pls . 
  it 's not something spectacular . 
  romania is growing economically based on lower taxes , foreign investment and faith in the economy and political stability ( meh ) . 
  there 's a lot published in romanian explaining every aspect , but the tl : dr is `` lower vat 's made people buy more , factories are moving production because wages are cheap , we buy stuff so we 're happy and like it here '', 
  pretty much the same as in regular poland, 
  i do n't know if you know this , but `` taranpula '' means `` peasant dick '', 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2qyv1xh.jpg ) map from / r/mapgore shows the historical differences between poland-russia and other poland ( the one bordering ** ausria ** hungary ), 
  like what ? 
  '' ... but i still stole 4 toothpicks and this pack of sugar , because you never know when you need 4mg of sugar '', 
  the good thing that came out ( for us ) out of your unfortunate situation ( alongside hungary and maybe greece ) is that these leaders are seen as extremists or eccentric , and , after the bad media , romanians are less likely to vote for people like them . 
  so , thank you poland . 
  i think the general consensus is to consider the years before high school as primary . 
  most countries have a number of years that are `` obligatory '' , but that does n't mean that if you do n't go they 'll force you into going . 
  in romania , the obligatory education is until year 10 . 
  so you have year 0 ( at about age 6 ) when you can enlist your kid into a preparation year ( not kindergarten ) , years 1-8 obligatory primary , years 9-10 obligatory high school and the rest ( 2years hs and university ) are optional , but almost nobody will hire you if you do n't have the degree for finishing your 4th ( sometimes 5th ) year of high school, 
  imagine if this was done by measuring : - yeah , mate , could you , uh , drop your pants ? 
  - uhm - good , good , god i hate this job , uhm , could you , ah , get hard for me mate ? 
  - i mean , pfff , i 'm trying . 
  kinda hard with 40 other men jerking it next to me . 
  and after that imagine all the men saying `` it was so cold inside '' in 40 degrees weather . 
  romanians need personal space because nobody around here seems to know the concept exists , especially older people on public transportation . 
   there are ones that resonate through the whole nation . 
  -- '' boss , do you have a ( - n extra ) cigarette ? '', 
  i swear to god , if i hear this one more time . . 
  so what does kekes mean?the blue one ? 
  nothing is too difficult for our not-pm-but-totally-the-pm dragnea . 
  good to hear . 
  the second part , at least . 
  are things in portugal that bad ? 
  i mean , i know portugal does n't exactly have the fastest growing economy but still , i expected something closer to spain or italy . 
  how would you pronounce * jade * in french ? 
  i 'm in . 
   that is who you are named after , not the latin romans . 
  truth be told , the latin romans were the worst type of romans you could be named after . 
   4 million romani people in romania , which is 20 % of your population hold your horses there , discount denmark - 4 mil is closer to 22 % . 
  ukraine would 've been so rich if this would have been real . 
  clearly, 
  good thing you acted early and not based on a eu4 reference you did n't get . 
  nothing some harsh treatment ca n't fix . 
  i do n't think 3 eur buys you decent bread in switzerland , but , then again , there 's also a huge gap in wages . 
  in any case , 3 !, 
  nope . 
  i think it 's actually 2.92 eur . 
  reason why it 's so cheap is that that was the only way to break the market dominance of orange and vodafone . 
  one company , now owned by t-mobile , halved the prices . 
  another company decided to do better and got the prices to the level you see today . 
  they also offer 1gb fiberlink internet for 10 eur, 
  romania : for 3 eur/mo you get unlimited everything except international calls/texts . 
  this is from a local provider . 
  4g speed gets capped after 20 or so gb and 3g after 40gb of traffic if i remember correctly . 
  bucharest , romania : english is widely spoken . 
  - rent is 300eur tops if you do n't want anything fancy . 
  ( 2 bedroom appartment in a decent area ) - university is cheap , most cost about 800eur/year or free if you are in the first ~ 1/3 results wise . 
  - wages are low if you have little education and require romainian which is pretty hard to master but there are domains that are paid great by comparison with the cost of living and there are big communities of arabic speaking people and there is no racism problem concerning them that i know of . 
  a lot of them have started businesses and prefer hiring people of similar culture and backround . 
  it 's not the best country in the world but it might be what you 're looking for , at least at the moment . 
  crime is also very low and romania is one of the fastest growing countries in europe gdpwise . 
  edit : if you know a bit of it , english is all you need and wages start at ~ 700-1000eur, 
  yes , yes . 
  remember that catholic priest whose vision made belgium a better country ? 
  cause i sure do n't . 
  the question was if anyone * hunts * mushrooms as a hobby or at a small scale .
