  nevertheless , good post . 
  did n't know about the virgins market . 
  did n't want to know either , but still . 
   there are prostitutes , as we say for `` every wallet '' . 
  to clarify : `` for every wallet '' is the thing we say , not `` there are prostitutes for every wallet '' . 
  it 's not like when someone tells you he 's broke you cheer him up with `` do n't worry , mate , there 's a prostitute for every pocket '' . 
  also , it 's more common to say `` for every pocket '' rather than wallet . 
  anal mcdick rape has spoken !, 
  it 's in the grey area of things too uncomfortable to discuss . 
  if there 's a lgbt couple married in a country where it 's legal it wo n't be recognized in romania , but if they act as a couple in relation to a romanian entity , without actually being here , it will sort of be accepted . 
  it 's in the `` i do n't wan na talk about it '' file cabinet alongside stuff like prostitution . 
  prostitution is illegal but there 's sort of no sanction if you 're caught prostituting yourself . 
  you 'll be fined for sex in a public area or something related . 
  steve . 
  not the republic of steve , just steve . 
  that 's great news . 
  i hope people are supporting this move and not siding with the president . 
  the day every russian asked himself `` how can slovakia beat us , they do n't even play football in ne micronesia '', 
  there 's also less pressure from parents to get married . 
  see china for example where 28 yo unmarried women are called `` leftovers '' . 
  it 's not generally used when talking about human reproduction, 
  bee hives need to be something like 10km away from any major road so bees do n't take pollen from flowers exposed to exhaust gases . 
  there ca n't be any pesticide used in the same radius . 
  they ca n't add sugar to the honey or any chemicals . 
  things like that . 
  wait 10 years or so . 
  their kids will have whatever your citizenship is so you wo n't have this problem anymore . 
  no more import beggars for you !, 
  best made is home made , or whatever . 
  yes , seems reasonable to think that refugees , who made people think twice about open borders and * not * the increased trade with western europe , are the reason for the reconsideration regarding romania joining the schengen area . 
  i 'll also call everybody i know and tell them that we ** must ** prioritize those thank-you emails to the terrorists , we 're not moving fast enough . 
  in my experience , people see greece as the bad guy in relation to germany . 
  i understand , though , why germany would be seen in a bad light by greeks . 
  nobody , ** with an objective view on things ** , would consider germany bad if they refused to be part of an unproductive deal . 
  but keep in mind that 's only step 2 . 
  you 're taking for granted the fact that greece will have a ~ 2 % gdp increase ( sans tourism ) without contracting any other loan in that 2 year span . 
  i , personally , belive they ca n't do it , and it will prove the point that greek policies are not where they need to be so the people who lead the country should change them , or the people should change those who lead . 
  page 22 and 23 have the detailed analysis by country . 
  that kind of move need a ** guarantee ** for the future . 
  they should suspend the payments for 2 years or so and see what happens in that time period . 
  if greece does n't show comparable economical results to other states ( that are paying off debts in the meantime ) without taking into account tourism ( unreliable ) then do nothing , but if things look like they could improve it would be undeniable that everyone would benefit from some kind of deal . 
  debt cancellation based on the sole reason that the loanee ca n't pay is never an option . 
  `` pay debts '' is a satirical take on a real situation while the confusion between romanians and gypsies is based on ignorance . 
  imagine if people actually believed that the greek debt crisis would have been caused by the fact that greeks are lazy fishermen that do n't understand economics , rather than the reality . 
  then i 'd come and reinforce that and then say `` why so butthurt ? '', 
   writing paragraph texts as a general rule , if i do n't take time to organize my text , i do n't expect anyone to take time to read it . 
  as for length , it 's 4 lines of text , seriously now , 30 seconds reading time . 
   do you see me downvoting people ? 
  well , do you see me downvoting people ? 
   the ~ ~ butthurt ~ ~ people on this subreddit , i swear to god . 
  i gather you wanted to say that people think romanian and gypsy are the same thing , so they make jokes about it . 
  that 's a misconception and it 's usually common between stupid , uninformed or ignorant people . 
  if you have an account on reddit i assume you consider yourself a pretty competent dude , so i do n't understand why you 'd argue against someone telling you you made a mistake with the reason for why it 's a mistake . 
  `` fer '' is a gypsyball thing , not romaniaball . 
  know your references . 
  i hear it 's near impossible to find it even in bucharest . 
  not even that many cocaine dealers . 
  ecstasy , on the other hand , is easy to find . 
  obviously the worst case scenario is war . 
  i 'm not talking terrorist attacks or something like that , but rather war with russia . 
  while terrorist attacks are awful the casualties are extremely low on our side if you compare it to any other war in history . 
  good thing for most of the west is that the war would probably take place in the east - ukraine , north-east until poland . 
  best case scenario is that most of the economies remain stable . 
  in the end , even if not everybody is driving a ferrari , the fact is most europeans can live a decent life , not having to worry about not having food to put on the table . 
  a small loan of 200k maybe . 
   then explain to me how those minimum wage low education people are the most unemployed of all people ? 
  i provided an explanation . 
   so in short you agreed with me we need your highly educated people and not more low income job people to work at our grocery stores ? 
  there was literally one answer to one question that you needed to process . 
  it was impossible to get that conclusion if you would 've read my comment and remembered yours . 
  i 'm done . 
  either you ca n't or wo n't understand what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm thinking it 's the first one based on the low effort comments . 
  here are some reasons off the top of my head . 
  * the ratio between low and high educated people is not where it needs to be . 
  people with higher education will often try to work something out if they find themselves unemployed . 
  those who lack education will blame the system usually and develop a belief that it 's everyone 's fault and they ca n't be blamed . 
  ( not saying that belief is wrong or anything , just saying it does n't help their case at all , quite the opposite ) * there 's always a need for higher educated people as their work translates to more money . 
  in light of this , employers will be willing to invest more in training and getting them better at what they need to do , so they will be more qualified for their next job as an indirect result . 
  low pay jobs offer little training or other benefits and can only hire as much as it is needed to fill the request . 
  if i hire 50 programmers over my needed amount , i will be able to assign them to another project or encourage them to create something that might be worth my investment . 
  if i hire 50 more janitors over what 's needed , i 'd be throwing money away , as they need an already existing unit where they can go and do their job . 
  * people with less education will almost never relocate , at least not far away , unless they are desperate . 
  it 's hard to leave your house ( usually your most precious possession ) and i understand that , but it 's still a fact . 
  people with higher education will often relocate if needed ; the amount of apartments available for rent in a non-tourist city points towards the level of people who were born there and work elsewhere with a stable job and no predictable coming back date . 
  * it 's hard to motivate yourself to work if the difference between social aid and potential wage is small . 
  obviously i 'd be more motivated to get up for work every morning if the difference would be from 100 to 1000eur , not that much from 100e to 300e . 
  just like you need some guy to work for minimum wage at the grocery store , rich countries need poor ( er ) countries to supply them with cheap workforce . 
  because of this , there is no interest in getting serbia , moldova etc at a decent level . 
  here 's what would happen if everybody would have a good education and their countries would do well for themselves : everybody would want to work in an office , but that office ( building , road to it etc ) would need to be built , maintained and cleaned . 
  nobody from europe would take that job so we 'd have to import workforce from africa or asia . 
  there would be a huge difference in culture between the two groups and , as all the europeans are educated people with high paying jobs and all the non-europeans would be the opposite , we 'd almost certainly create a division by race , so racism would be rampant . 
  this racism problem would be ** impossible to fix ** . 
  the way you fix it is by providing a chance at education in order for the victim to integrate , but , if they would integrate , we 'd need other imports who would work for low wages , and this time we need more than before . 
  so let 's say the effort pays off and 50 % would get decent education and will now want high paying jobs . 
  if at first we had , say , 100mil europeans and 20mil asians came over to fill the gap , we 'd now have 110mil educated and 10mil uneducated , so we 'll need 12mil more . 
  this will go on for generations and will lead to europeans hating asians because they benefit from tax benefits , free this or that , in order to help them integrate and asians ( especially the now educated ones ) will hate europeans because of the racism issue . 
  this is just one of many scenarios and it focuses on a very specific part of the problem , but i believe that it 's hard to argue against it and it alone would be enough to deter the eu from trying to reach financial stability all around europe . 
  edit : adding to the part about racism . 
  but what if , hear me out here , you pay for the condom , but it comes with a test run .
