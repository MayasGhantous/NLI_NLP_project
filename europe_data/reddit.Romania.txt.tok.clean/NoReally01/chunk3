  you do n't pay for sex , but you need to know you can rely on their product . 
  it 's obviously more complicated , but a romania-bulgaria union of any sort would , without a doubt , benefit both of us a lot . 
  i 'm shocked , ** shocked ** . 
  yes , please . 
  there 's no way we would decline that offer . 
   who the hell wants to enter a password and pay a fee per minute of usage of site ? 
  at least that was the hope when they made the law . 
  * a total of 185 countries . 
  * the idea that we can only have first/second/third world countries . 
  * romania ranked # 61 ** that must mean ** romania is a first world country . 
  ignore the statistics about rural population and infant mortality and unimportant stuff like that . 
  ** it 's undeniable ** now . 
  who would 've thought anti-vaxxer logic would benefit anything ever . 
  page 17 and page 27 for the incredibly lazy ones . 
  i would 've guessed `` p\u00e4\u00e4st\u00e4 paastosta '' meant `` pasty pasta '' . 
  did they get the `` miss '' title ? 
  yes and no . 
  while it 's true current day rep. moldova was part of moldova the country , all the records show that both wallachians and moldovans spoke the same language , had the same culture and were basically the same people . 
  if you want to take into account only the historic geo-political side of things , yes , rep. moldova was half of a different country , but i feel that that 's not the whole story . 
  that 's the problem they 're trying to fix . 
  nitpicking a bit here . 
  mexico should try a sneak attack on houston . 
  they should stop being pussies and take texas back . 
  now ** that ** would be entertaining to watch . 
  it even has a tattoo . 
  that tree really wanted to be alpha . 
  obviously people care more about it happening , rather than thinking about why or how . 
  this is in part because people hate thinking as a rule . 
  it is somewhat accepted that the initial impulse was most definitely caused by the eu membership . 
  the actual `` fight '' and it 's success is attributed to laura kovesi , and rightly so . 
  i 'd say both parts are important , but people have n't asked themselves this question that much so i ca n't give you an informed answer . 
  '' ** europe ** travel alert '' . 
  is n't declaring all of europe as unsafe a bit overkill ? 
  i 'm pretty sure wartime finland would be safer that any normal day in dc . 
  or an empire . 
   do romanians think it 's all just a mafia show ? 
  there is strong support from the people . 
  general trust in the dna ( anti-corruption agency ) is at an all time high and one of the most trusted institutions of the state . 
  romanians knew corruption was rampant for decades but they felt that they could n't do anything . 
  now everyone feels like their big brother just came to deal with the bullies . 
  this time they are getting back some money at least . 
  to my understanding they froze some accounts and will recover somewhere around 10mil $ . 
  this might not be that impressive but it 's 10mil $ more than 0mil $ . 
  also , even if they recover nothing , it still discourages corruption and this is obviously more valuable than whatever was stolen until now . 
  yes , that 's a totally valid reason to call a country a * failed state * i 'd also like to add that a letter was n't delivered last month and i saw a street lamp that did n't work a few weeks ago . 
  you had a good run , belgium , but we ca n't just ignore this stuff . 
  i wonder if it 's the gdp per capita of the countries or the gdp per capita of the regions that make today 's countries . 
  they have no reason to ignore kosovo , the czech rep or slovakia if the source data is for the regions of europe , because kosovo or no kosovo , that land was there 100 years ago . 
  this makes is it seem like it 's historical data of the the economy of the countries that existed back then and ignoring the border changes , but ( if i remember correctly ) ukraine did n't exist in 1890 and it exists on the map . 
  i know , i know . 
  i 'm just saying it 's amateur work . 
  the title is pure clickbait and the article itself seems like it was written in a 15 minute coffee break , half of it being spent spellchecking . 
  ps : i 'm pretty sure that every language uses `` cost '' in that manner . 
  i actually checked all my comments on this thread to see if i made some huge grammar mistake that would make you believe i do n't understand english . 
  thanks . 
   i am not surprised if romania was the worst offender over those years . 
  yeah . 
  hard to argue with that one . 
   corrupt european countries costing eu nearly # 800bn a year i 'm fairly sure the writers from the english newspaper know english well enough to differentiate between `` x is costing the eu '' and `` the eu is missing out on . . ''  the new estimate of the total ** annual loss ** , at # 782bn  this is because it measures the full ** cost of the problem ** i 'm certain i can find a misleading sentence in every paragraph of the article . 
  transparency international lists italy as a country with more corruption than romania . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 ) . 
  the independent linked to the same map 2 months ago [ here ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/somalia-north-korea-and-afghanistan-named-most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world-but-fight-against-a6836286.html ) . 
  i do n't understand how corruption in a country can cost the eu 800bn . 
  i can understand a potential amount of money , but the eu ** losing ** 800bn because countries are corrupt is hard to believe . 
  can anyone link the study this is based on ? 
  i 'm having a hard time finding it . 
  the worst thing we can do is panic . 
  belgium will be surely on high alert from now on . 
  let 's just hope the number of casualties does n't rise . 
   looking into the situation what confuses me is why do moldovans not support unification as much as romanians seem to ? 
  very good question . 
  i 'll start by saying that , although i consider myself decently informed on the subject , it 's still just an opinion . 
  hard facts are hard to come by regarding this subject . 
  ** history ** the region ( bessarabia ) became the socialist republic of moldavia ( 1940ish ) as part of the ussr . 
  at this point in time it was overwhelmingly populated by romanians , as bessarabia was , for the most part of history , a romanian region . 
  this was part of the divide and conquer tactic used by the soviets . 
  following their `` independence '' , a lot of people were deported into forced labor decreasing the percentage of romanians from 75 % to 50-60 % . 
  fast forward to the 90 's . 
  the ussr falls , but , as ever , russians do not let go . 
  romania starts looking to the west , relations with russia are n't great . 
  anti-romanian propaganda in bessarabia has it 's beginnings . 
  this continues over the last 25 years and now the population over there is devided : some are pro-romania , some are pro-russia . 
  ** so there 's a chance , is n't it ? 
  ** no , not really . 
  russian propaganda has done it 's job , sadly . 
  the fear of russia is stronger than the desire to join us , and this is only in discussion regarding those who do want to unite . 
  so their only option is to support an independent rep. moldova knowing that they were kept underdeveloped on purpose and that the country was designed from the beginning to be dependent on russia . 
  they have no resources , no access to the black sea , people are leaving , those who stay behind mostly lack education . 
  they are exactly how the west portrays eastern europe . 
  we could push for unification , but it 's either too late or too early . 
  sadly this is the situation they 're facing . 
  he can be president from the moment he gains citizenship , if i remember their law correctly . 
  the 10 year delay was regarding my personal opinion of the point in time when romania will be at a point economically where we can handle annexing them and not leaving them with a feeling that they were somehow cheated or of not having been worth the effort . 
  as for the reunification desire : there is strong support from romania regarding it , not so much from rep. moldova . 
  i know it does n't seem so , but i would love it if they would join us again . 
  the only problem is that my love for moldova is second only to my love for calculated decisions and not regretting impulsive actions . 
  i will address the issue of reunification as a response to another comment somewhere in this thread . 
  i 'm also happy you 're taking an interest in eastern european politics , hope you get all your answers . 
  you have to take into account the current state of romania . 
  while it 's true that the fight against corruption is working , the economy is growing and the people in general are progressively living better lives , we still have regions in the country where unemployment is very high .
