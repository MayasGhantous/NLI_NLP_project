  we 're still suffering from the communist divide between urban and rural and also between big cities and small ones . 
  the region that 's doing the worst is our own moldova ( ne region of romania ) . 
  until we can think about annexing other territories we need to take advantage of what we have . 
  should we annex rep. moldova tomorrow it will help them very little in the first 5 years or so . 
  should this be true , they will surely regret the internal fighting and opposing russia just to live in the same conditions and losing independence . 
  this will cause unrest . 
  in my opinion this is the most likely scenario after annexation if things remain the same . 
  i 'm sure that 10 years from now we will be able to propose annexation and not suffer the consequences of going all in on a bluff . 
   from someone who knows very little about the area , why is he doing it ? 
  this was the question . 
  if he had asked for a 5 page essay about traian basescu i 'm sure i would have tried to include everything . 
  although you 're not wrong , it was n't relevant to the question . 
  was trying to keep it as short as possible , but yeah , that 's true . 
  here 's the long answer : ** very short history ** rep. of moldova used to be part of romania . 
  this is not worth getting into details , let 's just say ww2 happened and russia is not far away from us . 
  both countries became democratic republics ( for realsies this time ) in the early 90 's . 
  both struggled at first but romania overcame some of the problems and is now decent while moldova is maybe worse than 20 years ago . 
  ** how things stand now and why basescu is doing it ** firstly , basescu was the president of romania between 2004 and 2014 . 
  while he was legally elected and he had , say , support from 51 % of the romanian population , the other half really ** really ** did n't like him . 
  fact is , while he did do some shady stuff and was n't always subtle about what or who he disliked , we did get into nato , the eu , survived the recession , and are better overall by comparison to 10 years ago . 
  now , after he served for 2 ( maximum ) terms , he has no legal possibility to get presidency again . 
  moldova is in a political crisis ( alongside every other crisis imaginable ) and basescu wants to profit off of this . 
  ** why basescu winning elections in rm would not be a good thing ** * he will most likely take part in the corruption rather than fight it . 
  * this will upset russian supporters over there , a lot . 
  * he most likely wo n't solve anything directly . 
  ** why basescu winning elections in rm would be a good thing ** * he would actually push for unification . 
  this is a good thing for rm , not that great for romania . 
  * negotiations with the eu will be easier , as he is someone who went through that before . 
  * it would be a clear sign that rm wants to distance itself from russia . 
  this is more important to the region , rather than for rm itself . 
  * they might do better economically , not because of basescu 's reforms or anything like that , but because he will cling to presidency like nothing you 've ever seen , he 's practically immune to insults and pressure and he usually finds a way to handle problems . 
  this will create political stability , and that 's the first step to a better future for any country . 
  hope this helps . 
  romania exported to italy , usa , switzerland and france but somehow it 's worth 0m $ . 
  did we give up free samples or some shit ? 
  did they return them within 30 days ? 
  in romania it started snowing yesterday at ~ 9pm . 
  snowed for 4-5 hours . 
  now it 's like 15c, 
  [ does n't seem so ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/gdp-per-capita ), 
  in our defense , we did try to do more . 
  moldova has a lot of problems , but it 's law system is a joke . 
  if you invest in a company in moldova and by some miracle it 's successful , you have no guarantee against someone just coming to your gate saying `` yeah , this is mine now '' . 
  they reject unification talks and we 're in no position to throw money away . 
  they need to get their shit together ; until then , nobody can help them . 
  nowhere outside of iceland could you increase artificial light by 20 % with just one light bulb . 
  ah , i see your point now . 
  i was n't thinking about that side of things . 
  you misunderstood . 
  i 'm saying knowing those languages is a big advantage on the job market . 
  you can be one of the few connections between a population of like 5mil ? 
  with anyone in ro wanting to do regular business with them . 
  good news is that there are almost no speakers of estonian/finnish ( related ? ), 
  in romania , so finding a job should be easy . 
   everybody would profit not really . 
  political tension in that general region would be something to avoid . 
  i 'm not saying they should n't think about joining or that them joining would be unthinkable , but it 's something with very low chances of happening in the next decade , unless somehow the eu ** needs ** them to join . 
  really nice . 
  clicked on it and expected to waste 4 minutes . 
  quite the opposite result . 
  agreed, 
  it 's also interesting to note that the romanian way of saying `` for fuck 's sake '' is `` in my dick '' ( in pula mea ), 
  there 's a long list here but one of the most common curses in romanian is more or less threatening someone with fucking their mothers ' dead relatives . 
  i 'm certain there 's a plan b actually . 
  it 's just that it is n't one that will win votes . 
  plan b is using armed forces . 
  it was and still is the solution when the pc way fails . 
  maybe he 's talking about lenin, 
  you have to admire turkey . 
  500 years and no change in foreign policy . 
  the third law of eastern europe : `` for every action or plan there is an equal and opposite balkan alternative '' ( maria sharapova - `` how to train your feet for chess '' 1932 ), 
  i feel like when the teacher asked a question and the front rows are trying to come up with the most complicated answer . 
  the simplest way to look at it is this : western europe is great , anything else is shit . 
  a lot of non-western-europeans at our door ? 
  fuck that . 
  make `` insert country '' great again !, 
  i doubt bulgarians would just give up their hard earned independence , but yeah , it does sound like a great idea to create a force in the region . 
  country 's twin would be the republic of moldova . 
  closest ally would be any country with similar interests . 
  hard to say in times of peace . 
  throw in a war and we 'll find out . 
  this response is for any country , not for romania . 
  i personally would n't mind bulgaria joining romania . 
  there 's a lot of potential there regarding trade and tourism . 
  the other reason is the fact that no other neighboring country would be a good option : rep. moldova would bring literally nothing to the table , serbians are nationalists by default , relations with hungary are `` not-great '' and that 's the best they 've been in a long time and then there 's ukraine . 
  all i see is `` 1 nap/day maximum '' . 
  you do n't own me , sign !, 
  depends on what you 'd settle for . 
  anywhere between 200 and 500e/m . 
  keep in mind that we 're not talking about some luxury apartment or anything . 
  for 300 e/month you can either get a one bedroom apartment close to the centre ( 30min ) or a 2 bedroom apartment like 1hour away . 
  i 'm talking walking distance . 
  here 's an idea of bucharest expenses . 
  * renting a small apartment in eastern bucharest will cost 250e/m + expenses like water/heating/etc . 
  ( so like 300 total ) . 
  it 's 30min away by metro to anywhere else in the city and close to the corporate area . 
  * food will cost about 100e if you always eat at home and another , say , 10e every time you eat out . 
  ( nothing fancy again ) * add another 100e for random stuff and that 's it . 
  you can live comfortably with 500e . 
  i do n't want to get your hopes up here , and do n't expect 3000e in the first 3 years or so , but here you ca n't get anyone that knows any programming language with 400e .
