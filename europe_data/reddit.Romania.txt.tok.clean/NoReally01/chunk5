  i mean , maybe you can get unlucky and only get like 700eur , but i 've never heard of any full time programmer with under 800eur . 
  again , do n't make big decisions over what some random dude on reddit told you . 
  do some reasearch , decide for yourself . 
  maybe i do n't know what i 'm talking about . 
  edit : timisoara is a bit cheaper so let 's say 450eur for the same things and cluj should be just about the same as bucharest but i only went there as a tourist and could n't tell you anything for sure . 
  edit2 : [ this ] ( http://img.wall-street.ro/image_thumbs/thumbs/9a96c0ce315129fa9e29e087fab9b9f1/760x0-00-65.jpg?v=1440489850 ) from [ this ] ( http://www.wall-street.ro/articol/careers/187929/cu-ce-salarii-sunt-remunerati-angajatii-din-domeniul-momentului-it-ul.html ) . 
  google translate is your friend, 
  then , if you really want to , have a look at bucharest , timisoara and cluj . 
  there are countless job offers with wages starting at , say , 1000e/month if you have no experience . 
  if you 're good at your job and have a bit of experience i 'd say you could get 2000e-2500e with ease + medical insurance + somewhat flexible hours, 
  if it is your thing , knowing romanian is n't even a requirement , provided you 're fluent in english . 
  i know , i know . 
  but you have to admire the simple nature of naming stuff after what they do and adding - zeug . 
  `` you told me you 'd throw that thing away months ago '' `` i 'll throw it away tomorrow , before i leave for the station '' . 
  `` fucking husband of mine , leaving this shit in the gar ... oi , you forgot this at home . 
  should 've listened to the family , should 've married hans '', 
  tomorrow in the news : `` it 's `` unacceptable '' that romania will have a fence at the border with hungary , and make them pay for it '' ( trump 2016 ), 
  i just find it funny that germans call a vehicle a `` driving thing '' ( fahrzeug ), 
  contries are unlikely to keep using the euro if , say , half of those that are part of the eurozone decide to revert to their former currencies . 
  the reasons for this are a bit debatable , but , in general , i consider it a solid bet . 
  should everyone decide `` k , that did n't work '' and switch away from the euro , we can be certain that the monetary exchange market would be more or less of a joke for at least a year . 
  this will cause international trade ( for example ) to slow down , as risking it for no apparent reason is obviously stupid . 
  inflation/deflation will depend on the country . 
  one thing that is for certain is that the $ will increase in value , should nothing major happen in the us in this timeline . 
  infrastructure - or rather , the corruption surrounding building and maintaining it . 
  the almost complete lack of education in rural parts of the country . 
  the public health system . 
  again , a major problem in rural areas , minor in big cities . 
  based on what exactly ? 
  it 's a bit more complicated , but to answer your question : yes , our intelligence service is considered very capable as of late . 
  this is , in part , the result of higher budgets . 
  just in 2016 , the internal intelligence service had a ~ 39 % increase in its budget . 
  police presence on the streets serves mainly to discourage crime , not to have close available units to intervene . 
  the lower crime rates and the newly active presence of law enforcement services on social media has increased the trust in their capabilities and made them more relatable . 
  this caused people to stop thinking that * `` all cops are bastards '' * and , as a result , both civilians and police officers are more comfortable with being on the street . 
  my mistake . 
  somehow i did n't notice that . 
  small hotspots are n't usually representative for any general statistic , just like the richest neighborhoods are n't . 
  on top of that , people are less likely to report a crime in a poor neighborhood and police are less likely to act or even register it . 
  the chart in that particular comment is for * perceived * crime , not actual statistics . 
  it 's ok for general discussions , but it should not be taken as hard data . 
  tirana does ** seem ** safer . 
  [ not really ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_cities.jsp?country1=italy&amp;country2=albania&amp;city1=rome&amp;city2=tirana ) it depends on what you consider dangerous . 
  i 'd say there are more chances to get killed in tirana but it 's far more likely to get your wallet stolen in rome . 
  edit : i assume you 're talking as somebody who never went to the cities you 're talking about and still thinks we 're in the 90 's, 
  also , [ these ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016&amp;region=150 ) are the statistics for cities, 
   i understood that you were comparing your very fast fiber internet with our very fast mobile internet . 
  those are not really comparable . 
  1gbps over fiber is simple . 
  i 've already covered that i was n't ( and why ) . 
  as for the real question i asked . 
  found the answer for myself , thank you . 
  i thought mbps and mb/s are the same thing . 
  750mbps is 93.75 mb/s . 
  i now understand that we need to stream from 6 ( not from ~ 45 like i believed ) cameras filming at 1080p@60fps via a samsung s10 hotspot , 5 years from now . 
   the trick is that it 's wireless . 
  so is 4g . 
  i do n't know where you were going with that one . 
   we 've had 1gbps fiber internet for many years . 
  that 's great . 
  i was n't trying to win a competition . 
  we have it for only ~ 2 years ( i believe ) , did n't know you were so advanced in this domain since 2010 or whatever `` many years '' stands for . 
  here is what i do n't understand and why . 
  is 750mbps something that was previously believed to be impossible ? 
  we have 4g with up to ~ 300mbps ( @orange i believe ) and i do n't think it was a big deal when they introduced it , or i must 've missed the party . 
  was there a smartphone or tablet that could transfer data at 300mb/s and the providers needed to one up the phone companies , and today they finally did it ? 
  otherwise i do n't understand why we 're having this conversation . 
  edit1 : oh , and to explain why i mentioned fiber . 
  there is a need for high speeds and the technology to receive data at that speed , and that need is taken care of via fiber , because there is hardware advanced enough . 
  so the only reason this could affect anything else than mobile devices is if the mobile internet would be faster or would have some other technical advantage , which , to my understanding , it does n't . 
  if it works for you , i see no need to spend anything extra to get a land connection . 
  good for you , dude . 
  i understand the basics of it all , and it 's great that lithuania gets 4g . 
  my question was solely on the 750mb/s part . 
  from the title i understood ( might be wrong ) that it would be theoretically possible to get a plan with 750mb/s maximum speed . 
  if in reality there 's a 750mb/s cap , divided between how many use it at a specific time , i do n't understand why that 's news . 
  we have 1gb/s fiber optic internet in romania and 4g mobile internet . 
  i assumed this must be somehow better then what we have . 
  it depends on how soon you 'll use that infrastructure , because maintenance is usually expensive and it tends to degrade , and this is the happy situation in which the actual future is as projected . 
  i believe such an investment would n't be the safest bet , but that 's just me . 
  would n't this be good only for internet usb sticks ? 
  i doubt any smartphone has good enough hardware to recieve data at that speed . 
  it 's not like he could 've done anything about it , given that the eviction was done legally . 
  wikipedia does n't seem a reliable source to me . 
  i find a few of these variations hard to believe . 
  there would be , to some extent at least . 
  the article would provide details , so if you would be interested in the subject you would click on the link , as opposed to the current trend of needing to access the link in order to decide if you have interest . 
  yeah , but then again , any title would be if they did n't want it to be click-bait . 
  they missed the opportunity for a great title , it should 've been : `` only policeman who ever wrote a book enforces the law on his superiors while one of the leaders of the local red cross is the opposite of helpful '', 
  things might not look good over there , but here 's the plan i propose based on what happened in romania that accelerated the anti-corruption effort : * first : acknowledge that things ca n't go on like this and spread the word . 
  this was 2008-2010 roughly in ro . 
  * second : identify the party that does most of the corruption . 
  this should be easy as it usually is the party that has had the most power in the last decade . 
  in romania 's case there were 2 : pd and psd . 
  * third : search for the opposing party that will ** never ** ally with that particular party and is not usually one of the favorites at elections . 
  hype them up , find good things about the younger or second line of politicians in that party . 
  get support on the internet for them , usually facebook is the most receptive . 
  * get them to win or at least make them get enough votes in order for them to catch a lot of media attention . 
  second situation is better , because they will realize why they got votes and will promote those members that fit the criteria , but it will take longer . 
  * they should win in the next 4-12 years and ** will have ** to do part of the things they promised and will likely focus on corruption , as that would be the most important project on their list .
