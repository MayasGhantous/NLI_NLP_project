  i know this is a lengthly process , but it will produce results and it 's something ** you ** can do from the comfort of your desk . 
  we did , sort of . 
  i remember reading that in the year 2006 , in bucharest , there were at most half the number of beggars that were in 2000 . 
  that happened because people stopped giving them money . 
  after 2007 , * a lot * of people emigrated to wherever in the eu and became beggars . 
  i do n't know of any data but i bet there are 5 times more romanian beggars now as compared to 2000 , simply because the north ( not the west ) simply throws money at them for no goddamn reason . 
  worst enemy and closest rival are different things in my opinion . 
  closest rival would be hungary , because they have claims over land in romania and let 's just say relations are n't always respectful . 
  ~ ~ worst enemy would be russia , but then again they would destroy us if war starts , so ~ ~ we do n't have a worst enemy , we believe in peace in europe and we respect every country , unless nato wants to attack , in which case fuck everybody , it 's not like we 're gon na say `` no '' . 
  ukraine , poland , rockets . 
  putin will love to hear that the neighbors get along . 
  them being capable of being independent is another discussion altogether ( spoiler - they are n't ) . 
  the real question is - should romanians want unification ? 
  ( spoiler - they should n't ) every other aspect except them being basically romanians points to annexation being a bad idea at this point in time . 
  the fact that we would go for it , even though we have our own problems and the annexation would create far more of those , while they would n't , even though they have ** a lot ** to gain , speaks volumes . 
  it 's a rather complicated explanation . 
  both romania and moldova became democratic republics at about the same time , ** but ** romania , in time , escaped the influence from russia and moldova did n't . 
  in the early years things went , as expected , pretty badly for both countries , but romania slowly grew into a fairly stable eu member with a growing economy while moldova did n't . 
  moldova stayed ( or was kept , depending on who you ask ) a poor country with terrible corruption and heavy russian propaganda for 25 years . 
  this is a known fact there and people are sick of it , so , naturally , they want to be truly independent . 
  so that 's basically the root of those statistics . 
  romania feels it 's in a safe position and could annex moldova if that 's what 's wanted over there , while moldova is sick of external influence and just wants to be left alone . 
  it 's not that much them not wanting unification with romania , but rather them wanting everybody to let them have a try at ruling their own country . 
  you 're clinging to a word out of a 5 row comment . 
  what word would 've been better to describe a guy who became the image of communist crime while doing only a small percentage of the total damage ? 
  as for the second part , i can tell anyone anything with a straight face , as long as i can back it up . 
  taking things personal ** never ** helped anybody . 
  you have a point . 
  no problem . 
  good question . 
  your definition has 2 cases . 
  `` takes on the sins of others '' or `` is unfairly blamed for problems '' . 
  if they made 2 cases , that must mean they are different . 
  in the second case the main point is that he is innocent , so in the first case he must be guilty , but is charged for more than he has done . 
  my logic is based on the fact that `` taking the sins of others '' and being `` unfairly blamed '' can not be the same thing . 
  it is , sort of . 
  romania never had to deal with big minorities ^ 1 so racism ^ 2 was never a big deal here . 
  anti-racism laws exist ^ 3 and have existed for a long time . 
  as such , hate speech was never a * real * problem here so it did n't need regulation . 
  of course we have our anti-hungarian extremists , anti-rroma , feminists and what not , but they never were enough of a problem to create such a law . 
  in my opinion , this is just old school politicians ^ 4 trying to do old school politics ^ also4 . 
  the population of romania usually identifies itself with overwhelming majorities regarding ethnicity , religion , politic views ( sort of ) and any other domains that might fall subject to hate speech . 
  ( ~ 90 % ethnically romanian , ~ 90 % orthodox , ~ 90 % pro not being the poorest country in the eu , thx bulgaria , we love you ) pulling numbers out of my ass , but you get the point . 
  i say racism , but i mean `` attacks on a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation '' [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ) 3 . 
  in the constitution , all the branches of private law and some of public law , although that 's a bit more complicated , as some things regulated by public law are exclusive to those with certain attributes . 
  by old school i mean communist . 
  psd is the former pdsr , party that was formed by the second line of politicians in pcr ( romanian communist party ) disclaimer : i 'm not saying other parties are different , but at psd this fact is the most obvious ; my attention on psd should not be viewed as a political preference towards another party , but objective considering the subject we 're discussing . 
  edit1 : grammar, 
  iliescu is a far bigger fish . 
  if visinescu is a pawn , iliescu is the king , the board and both the players . 
  that 's one opinion . 
  the other one is that they 're simply butthurt . 
  it wo n't pass , and if it will , it wo n't be enforced . 
  psd - the socialist democratic party - fails to understand again and again that their voters , 60 + year old people from the countryside , uneducated questionable-ethnicity overweight bus-riding-for-the-fun-of-creating-drama idiots * will die * in the next 20 years and they will be reduced to a local party in potatoville unless they somehow appeal to the youth . 
  he 's more of a scapegoat , not because he 's innocent , but because he was unfortunate enough to catch media attention . 
  he 's part of a large group of people who committed similar crimes , but most of the others either are influential or have benefited from the disappearance of various evidence . 
  the conviction in itself is good , but i fear that it will give the impression that something 's being done about the crimes of the communist era and of the revolution , and in reality there will be little further progress . 
  here we go again . 
  let 's break it down : * it 's a defamation law , not a censorship law . 
  * by defamation , it should be understood as the act or comment that puts a person into a position of inferiority based on his membership in a social group ( rough translation from defaimarea sociala este : `` fapta sau afirmatia prin care o persoana este pusa in situatie de inferioritate pe temeiul apartanentei sale la un anumit grup social '' ) * this `` step closer '' is not even the first one out of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 ( debatable ) , but just a preliminary procedure . . * it was to be expected that it would pass this particular step , as the guy who started the project is the leader of the party that has majority in parliament . 
  it will not pass . 
  it 's a bad move from a party that 's losing popularity . 
  even if it passes the vote of both rooms by some miracle , it will be contested by the constitutional court or by the president , one being independent ( obviously ) and the other being part of the opposing party , and , i might add , not stupid . 
  restaurants are private property , unless they are state owned . 
  but , otherwise , you 're right . 
  the hair is the biggest problem , especially if you bring a girl home . 
  her hair will be in your face all night and you ca n't just get up and sleep on the couch . 
  i 'm assuming you do n't sleep with underwear near your face , but if you do , i do n't judge . 
  it is . 
  in the original law there was a list and people found a way around it . 
  it 's intentionally vague so owners ca n't say they do not qualify as a subject for the law . 
  there were discussions about the fact that any house can qualify and should you have friends over that smoke you will be fined . 
  ^ this is stupid . 
  it 's held alive by people who do n't understand how laws work . 
  interpretation of any law is done `` in the letter and spirit of the law '' , so it 's intended to produce effects over the subjects that the lawmaker had in mind . 
  should a need for clarification appear ( say , if you had friends over , made noise , police came , and they found you smoking and fined you ) the lawmaker would clarify that the law does not apply in that specific case , so the fine would not stand should you contest it in court . 
  this , of course , is pure theory , as policemen are n't as retarded as the internet makes them seem , so they would know not to fine you for smoking , but for something they know will stand in court . 
   m ) spa\u0163iu public se \u00een\u0163elege orice spa\u0163iu accesibil publicului sau destinat utiliz\u0103rii colective , indiferent de forma de proprietate ori de dreptul de acces rough translation : public space should be interpreted as any space accessible to the public or for collective use , regardless of the form of property or the right of access . 
  i went to a smoke free restaurant a few months ago and i was surprised by the fact that ** you could smell the food ** . 
  this was great , although we did end up ordering everything on the goddamn menu and 89 % of us would go out every hour in a blazer at sub 0 temperatures . 
  so we went home broke and with a cold , but we did n't smell of smoke , so there 's that . 
  do the smokers in the igloo perform any kind of work ? 
  do kids play in or around it ? 
  does it have public access ? 
  if it 's not covered by a roof or tarp , held by at least 2 walls - yes . 
  join us next time on `` eu leaders '' where we find out ______ . 
  fill in the blank . 
  e-liquid usually contains nicotine . 
  i 'm guessing it 's an effort to discourage kids thinking about how cool smoking is . 
  e-cigs are not banned by any means , they 're just recognized as a smoking related product . 
  ( this needs more reasearch , i did n't have time to read every change to the original law ), 
  it 's a big change for bars and coffee shops . 
  we used to be able to smoke in 99 % of them , so romanians were a bit reluctant to support the change over the years . 
  recently i saw a poll that stated that 80 % ( or 90 ) are in favor of the law . 
  there is hope for a civilized eastern europe , and we seem to be leading the trend . 
  this makes me very proud . 
  ( speaking as a smoking romanian that goes to coffee shops on a next to daily basis ), 
  both the title and the article are a bit misleading . 
  clarifications and details : * the law is n't new , it 's newly modified . 
  the original law is l349/2002 .
