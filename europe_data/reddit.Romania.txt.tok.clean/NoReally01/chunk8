   how can you even be this insecure about this . 
  again , i 'm sure this is a tactic that works in your kindergarten . 
  using big statements and concentrating on the opponent rather than on the subject ( exclusively or in great proportion ) to attract the support of fellow 5 year olds works great in uneducated mediums . 
  often enough , arguments do n't matter if enough people are shouting `` you are cancer '' ( unrelated example , ofc . ), 
  see here 's where you 're wrong . 
  canada , for example , has no citizens , as all the people inhabiting it are a mix of english and french long term tourists . 
  the usa has 0 americans , as americans do n't exist . 
  there are about 70mil irish in the world and so on . 
  this is clearly the way to look at things . 
  so let me get this right . 
  to you , americans do n't exist . 
  all non-native citizens of the americas are french , spanish , irish and so on ? 
  like i said : those who were born in romania are romanians , even if they have hungarian ancestry . 
  if they wanted to move to hungary , they would 've , so clearly those who stayed want to . 
  if there are people with hungarian roots living ** unhappily ** in romania , they should either move or realise that they 're idiots that have options to solve their problem but ca n't be bothered to do something about it . 
  as for the land aspect . 
  it 's ours , not yours . 
  even if you believe it should be yours , the fact is that it 's ours at the time i 'm writing this . 
  notice the frustrated tone that accompanies blunt statements without backing on your side and the calm tone on my side . 
  this is the exact situation in small parts of transylvania : some dudes with big mouths do some attention whoring and everyone ignores them after they fail to understand counter arguments . 
  this being said , i will also take the general approach and end this conversation , as you and your side have failed to provide any information or opinions of any value to support your cause . 
  no , `` you are cancer '' does not hold any value in a debate outside hungary and league of legends . 
  i am truly sorry you did not have the chance at proper education . 
  i 'll pray for you . 
  cheers . 
  yes . 
  i 'll trust your assessment on the quality of arguments . 
  in other news , we 're not leaving our lands ( at least most of us are n't ) . 
  if you want it , come and get it . 
  let 's see how that works out . 
  there are no tensions to inflame . 
  if you want to be in hungary , the border is open . 
  if you 're still here , you 'll deal with it . 
  you overestimate the importance people give them . 
  unless they 're at least 100 years old or have moved from hungary to romania after their birth , they 're not hungarians . 
  it 's been a century . 
  if they were so upset with the situation they had plenty of time to leave . 
  those who are here chose to stay . 
  this ca n't be inflammatory . 
  as for useless , it 's as useless as celebrating the national day . 
   at most local news . 
  part of the aim of these kinds of events are to attract public attention to something or another or to encourage nationalism . 
  if this should make at most local news , what is the `` at least '' option ? 
  it 's also noteworthy that your comment is this bad after you edited it ; i ca n't begin to think about it 's original value . 
  most of the time you can show up to the station and buy the ticket . 
  i believe that the last ticket can be bought 5 minutes before the train arrives . 
  edit : i would not recommend buying the ticket 5 minutes before the departure . 
  if you get there an hour early you should be able to get a ticket in 95 % of trains , the other 5 % being full . 
  i do n't understand the part about the ticket and the reservation . 
  you buy a ticket and you get assigned a seat . 
  as for advice : [ this is the site you need ] ( http://www.infofer.ro/ ) . 
  on the left you can select the date , time , departure and arrival location and it will create a list of all the trains you can take and the price of the ticket . 
  regio trains are the worse comfort wise and go slower and stop at every station imaginable . 
  interregio are better . 
  if you 're a student you get a discount if you have something that proves it . 
  i 'm pretty sure this works even if you 're a student at a foreign university . 
  leg room is usually a problem so do n't be tall . 
  ( best advice ever , i know ) while some trains have ac , i would not recommend risking it during the day at 35 degrees c. do n't fall asleep if you travel alone because you never know . 
  there 's not much that 's different from trains in other countries . 
  this is actually a larger scale problem . 
  old people ( and adults over 40 ) vote more and , as the west has a aging population , they hold the majority of votes . 
  i know things are n't great right now in spain , but was n't it getting better ? 
  i might not remember correctly . 
  yeah . 
  this was over a long time ago . 
  better luck next time , dude . 
   i like to change the subject when it does n't go my way anymore . 
  maybe he did n't understand that i 'm mad ... what can i do ? ... i 'll just make more stupid statements without basing them on anything . 
  that will show the world i 'm smart . 
  no , my friend , we wo n't take you back . 
   asks about a highway he knows does n't exist , but the other guy gave a good answer  asks a better question about highways after looking at google maps . 
   he answers the question . 
  ... scratch the highway questions , they 're ineffective . 
  ** i 'll use my french charm ** , jk , i 'm also an immigrant . . where from ? ... moldova of course . 
  i hate people who make jokes about moldova but i myself make jokes about vaslui ( part of moldova ) . 
  i 'd be surprised if you could list all the countries in europe . 
  i 'm not even getting into placing them on the map , deciding what country is the moldova of europe would be way too much to ask . 
  you 'd need facts and data and that makes your brain hurt . 
  `` willingness to work '' is bolded for a reason . 
   but i guess the dumb circlejerk is stronk . 
  true . 
  ** as dumb as it gets ** . 
  you 're the third one to cherry pick that comment saying the exact same thing and ignoring the rest . 
  ** this ** is the comment . 
  you could 've quoted this part and bold the important parts you 're going to refer to , but why would you do it in the correct way when it gives you less of an advantage in defending mighty bacau and co. `` there are cities that are more successful than others ( bucharest , cluj , timisoara , constanta etc ) and , due to the success of these cities and others like them , certain regions are wealthier than others . 
  proximity to the west , quality of infrastructure , number of people , their education and willingness to work ( ... moldova ) , population density and land price are also important factors to consider . '', 
   i 'd be less critical as you are , considering that romania is the moldova of europe . 
  that 's the attitude they teach you not to have at the best uni 's in iasi . 
  if nobody opposes the general opinion that if moldova does n't get infrastructure , there 's nothing we can do than we 'll be in the same position 10 years from now . 
  you have cheap labor and tax exemptions . 
  companies move across continents for those things . 
  in hungary you mean ? 
  as close as moldova will be to the new romanian highway . 
  i 'll prepare myself for the economic boom . 
  the exact same number as there are between timisoara or cluj and bucharest . 
   as i said it 's minority . 
  of course . 
  i did n't phrase my idea correctly . 
  [ yes . ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/romania_historic_regions.svg/2000px-romania_historic_regions.svg.png ) there are cities that are more successful than others ( bucharest , cluj , timisoara , constanta etc ) and , due to the success of these cities and others like them , certain regions are wealthier than others .
