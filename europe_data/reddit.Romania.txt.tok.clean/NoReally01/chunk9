  proximity to the west , quality of infrastructure , number of people , their education and ** willingness to work ** ( ... moldova ) , population density and land price are also important factors to consider . 
  so , looking at the map provided in the link , dobrogea , muntenia , transilvania and banat are wealthier , while the others lag behind by more or less . 
  crisana , for example , is n't that bad ( also oltenia , although this is one of the regions where parts of it go really well and parts are really bad ) . 
  there 's also a highway being built right now that would connect the black sea ( next to dobrogea ) to hungary through crisana/banat that should impact the regional economy quite a bit when it will be finished ( large delays due to everything that could possibly go wrong happening and corruption ) . 
  the title should be `` one country , more economies '' -- edit : [ this article ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/economie/stiri/decalaje+dezvoltare+regiuni ) should further answer your question . 
  google translates it well . 
  ( the video offers the same information as the text , more or less ) . 
  the unification is between transilvania , crisana , banat and bucovina ( formerly under hungarian control for a while ) with the rest of romania . 
  edit 2 : the translation offered by google is actually not that great if i look closely . 
  this is interesting . 
  in romania , only the poor miss the days of communism ( well , the poor above 50 and the rebellious under 20 who never lived in communism ) . 
  there 's also a certain nostalgia for the times where everyone was equal , but people usually snap back from it because 1 . 
  equality was an illusion and 2 . 
  being equally dirt poor is not great at all . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that , in poland , even people who earn a decent living miss the days of communism . 
  if i remember correctly , romania and poland were equally poor in the 80 's , so the situation you face currently is certainly strange . 
  maybe the current political leadership might influence that a bit ? 
  also , i agree completely with your last paragraph . 
  the thing in romania is that the classes are divided like never before . 
  in urban areas : the young are earning a lot more than the same age group did 20 years ago , but those who are part of the workforce since before 2000 are stuck with low wages . 
  most ^ 1 under 35 earn decent wages and can afford eating out from time to time and some time off away from home . 
  there are plenty of companies that hire right now and it 's impossible to ** not ** get a job ^ 2 if you want it . 
  in rural areas there is a lot of subsistence farming so there is not a lot of money for investments or vacations . 
  this is on the decline , as people do not want to live in rural areas anymore , and there 's a trend already of large land owners expanding . 
  crop land prices are on the rise and have been for some time now and i hear more and more about european funds being accessed by large and medium size farmers ^ 3 . 
  this means that small villages will disappear in time and the average living condition of the country will improve . 
  there 's little the state can do for some of these people , as investments look ( again , in certain places ) like throwing money out the window . 
  this is , in large part , an effect of the transition from a small country between giants 100 years ago , to communism , to a struggling 3rd world country in the ' 90 's , to a decent 1st world one in the future , ** or at least that 's the hope ** ---------------------- 1 . 
  most should be read as 70 % + , not 99 % . 
  for those with little education might need to move a bit and understand nobody will give them management positions , but that does n't mean it 's not a possibility . 
  factory workers earn a decent wage and get opportunities that standing around and waiting for shit to fall from the sky does n't . 
  ( i 'm looking at you , moldova ) 3 . 
  the medium sized farmers ( 30-100 hectares or so ) might only get nonrefundable european funds of only 50 - 200k eur or so , but that 's still 50-200k they did n't have before . 
  we got yo ' back poland . 
  prepare your airports because our airforce is coming . 
  that 's exactly what i would say if we had an airforce . 
  the title is misleading . 
  it should be '' lithuania gets 200 used vehicles in a 8 mil $ deal with the netherlands '', 
  god damn it . 
  mikko , it just bearly looks like a sauna . 
  we talked about this . 
  nowhere in your comment do i see drinking ouzo and blaming germany for your troubles so i do n't believe you 're a true greek , i 'm sorry . 
  it 's the kind of thing you have to do because even if nobody cares if you do it , everybody cares if you do n't . 
  guess romania took his advice and stopped [ trolling ] ( https://twitter.com/ramsaysky/status/763504494109925376 ) . 
  is n't it a rule in britain to do exactly the opposite of what boris johnson says ? 
  pipeline bad . 
  no pipeline . 
  there 's no report of his arrest in the romanian or international media as of 2 minutes ago . 
  source , op ? 
  `` surely it will snow until tomorrow . 
  54 years i 've lived on this planet and i have n't seen 2 straight days without snow '' - lithuanian official in charge of uncool shit happening in portugal, 
  the point of the links was to offer opinions of economists not on reddit about the subject . 
  while the data is n't relevant , the theories are . 
  my point was that your average citizen should be more concerned with the lack of people to clean the streets , grow their food and sell it to them rather than a drop in gdp due to not being able to access the market . 
  edit : if i remember correctly , some 7 % of britain 's workforce is made up of workers from eu countries . 
  you 're free to believe otherwise . 
  i agree that there 's no point in debating this anymore . 
  it 's a contraction that you expect so it should be easier to manage . 
  it 's not a big deal by comparison . 
  when you talk or write about two subjects that are in close relation and offer an opinion about one of them , you can assume it 's given considering the other . 
  [ read.this ] ( http://www.oisp.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/pdf/wp57_who_s_afraid_of_population_decline__by_david_coleman_and_robert_rowthorn.pdf ) and [ this ] ( http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol25/13/25-13.pdf ), 
  the map would look quite a lot different if the size of the regions depicted would be equal across europe . 
  britain 's problem is losing cheap workforce and the companies that need it or seek it . 
  a 5 % drop in gdp is n't that big of a deal unless it snowballs . 
  it depends on how educated they are . 
  if they believe that most romanians come to steal or beg we 're more than happy to take them back alongside all the doctors and such and the hard working low payed ones since there 's a lack in workforce at the moment over here . 
  a jump of 2mil in population , mostly comprised of people who are fit and willing to work qould be incredible for our economy . 
  you have no idea . 
  that 's one of the hidden advantages of joining the eu . 
  trust me , we hate proffesional beggars way more than you . 
  half of them leaving was a blessing . 
  the way this could 've been done is by adding to `` the employee and his relatives will have the benefit of flying for free should seats become available '' one of two things : 1 . '', 
  the employee [ ... ] if there is n't a risk of the return flight to be full '' . 
  this will never happen , because it obligates the company to assess the risk every time . 
  there is no company with the financial power to buy a plane that will do something this stupid . 
  the employee [ ... ] in the time periods when the company considers that the risk of returning is low enough '' . 
  the company will chose february and november and that 's it . 
  people will not see this as much of a benefit and this is a big problem , as the company is surely using this as a selling point . 
  why is this the airline 's responsibility ? 
  these are the people that caused `` caution , when heated , contents get hot '' on food packaging ( paraphrasing ) . 
  how do you not expect this and why does it matter if the company told them about it ? 
  these are adults . 
  you assume they think about their actions and possible consequences , so , if they did , this is n't news , if they did n't , they will from now on . 
  so basically the equivalent of a 5km taxi ride . 
  they should 've written `` gift '' on the box . 
  that always fools customs . 
  reminds me of an article where the author was implying that nikola tesla was actually romanian and was named nicolae teasla . 
  it 's pretty hard to do that as of late . 
  if you would 've voted you would 've known that they scan your id now before voting . 
  sigh ... stop trying to be romania , england and wales !, 
  it 's not gon na happen . 
  all moldovans i know mix romanian with russian when talking to each other . 
  edit : ah , i see what you mean . 
  i did n't choose my words correctly in my first comment, 
  nope , well , not really . 
  it 's in romanian with elements of russian . 
  it 's sung by somebody from rep. moldova . 
  ( not that i know the song , the accent and the russian influenced romanin si their thing ), 
  sweden - pregnancies that end in abortion 69 % . 
  wow .
