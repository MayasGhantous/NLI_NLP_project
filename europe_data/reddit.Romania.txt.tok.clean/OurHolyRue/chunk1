  because , female iranian communists ... so quaint , feels like the 70s again . 
  i know , right ? 
  thoroughly depressing photos . 
  that 's my dream too , man , that 's my dream too . 
  how about a blowjob and steak and you call it a deal ? 
  dude , that 's hilarious , i ca n't wait to use that ( mem ) !, 
  6 months later ... same shit , same stink , and only a facebook photo as a memento . 
  communism 's legacy , i suppose it was n't * all * bad . 
  a grammatical nitpick : correct would be ' * whom * of you ' , would n't it ? 
  check out [ `` subcarpati '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xu1tkect4i ) if you have n't already !, 
  haha , i 'm the same , i love portuguese ( regardless of the regional variance ) and dislike castillian , especially when i hear women speak it , makes me want to claw their necks bloody . 
  i 'm ok with catalan though . 
  on the flip side , i * love * hearing polish girls talk , but not men . 
  check out [ if the seed does n't die ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1733118/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) , i 've seen it recently and i liked it a lot , it 's not just romanian though , but gives a look into balkan culture , or at least a feeling of it . 
  inb4 ro is n't a balkanic country etc. 
  awkward trailer , the acting lacks all naturalness more so from their speech than anything else . 
  terrible map . 
  too little focus on actual cartography and too much on cramming as many images as possible in w europe ( information overload ) . 
  looking at this map i feel an urge to write a bit of speculative historical fiction . 
  meeeedic , someone call for a medic !, 
  shots fired !, 
  please . 
  the election results mean nothing , and would 've meant nothing even if any of the other parties would 've won . 
  the bitter truth is the only thing winning the election does is give you the turn to be in the business of syphoning money from the state and through state power . 
  no party in ro has any real policy they want to pursue , it 's mostly random and decided by external circumstance , if you would ask the politicians what left and right mean in a political context they would n't be able to tell you ( in fact i saw some interviews a few years ago about this very issue ) . 
  i have no hope that local elections will solve any of the countries problems , only way something positive will happen is a ) through very slow and gradual change ; b ) if the eu will intervene more in the governing of its members . 
  it 's been the same for the last 200 years . 
  nope . 
  just think of how many people still live with parents or grandparents in the same house , plus women in general still consider it their task to cook , so you 'll have more homemade meals . 
  those can vary in quality , of course . 
  and since income is generally lower you ca n't really afford too much fast-food anyway . 
  what i 'm wondering is ... where are they aired ? 
  i 'd disagree with you on the german part , swiss german is bloody hard to understand !, 
  sometimes i forget switzerland is a part of europe . 
  it just does n't seem present at all . 
  somewhat . 
  it 's just that when i was in middle school i thought i loved the french language best ... until i heard someone speak it correctly and then all interest died . 
  i was even invited to paris for last new year 's eve but i had to turn it down because i just ca n't make myself go to france . 
  mind you , i do read a lot of french literature and am quite fond of it , it 's just the country itself that arouses no interest . 
  france is in reality more powerful than thought ( socio-economically ) , but at the same time the romantic fantasy that 's woven about it is quite disappointing in reality . 
  ( ` duh moment ' right ? ), 
  actually , i simply do n't care about france . 
  at all . 
  and i do n't know why . 
  good , the worst part of being a student in the uk is having to apply for that shitty yellow card just so you can work . 
  i think one reason for the decline in the quality of this subreddit ( if it has declined ) is the fact that if you have a lot of recurrent discussions then the level headed and more understanding people might have already had their say with a long and thought out post in the past and they might see no reason to either copy-paste it or say it again so you are left with mostly people that just take a very simple ( ignorant ) approach and bicker about that . 
  just look at the gypsy issue for instance , people often say either ` the societies where they are a large part of as a minority are n't tolerant enough and just blindly hating them ' ( this is usually people that have had little encounters with them ) , or it 's something like ` gysies are simply the scum of the earth ; what a horrible culture ; you do n't really understand etc. ', 
  but to me it 's a whole host of mixed factors that determine how people of a certain ethnic origin will turn out , and also how they will be perceived , it 's a complex issue that has n't had enough in-depth research nor has it ever been given a good enough discussion on reddit . 
  it 's either someone complaining about them because they have them as neighbours and they do n't like them , therefore fuck everyone else of that origin too ; or it 's someone that has no clue about it but is keen on promoting tolerance even in the face of intolerance . 
  so , once the n-th thread is again created and the largely the same discussions take place , it 's hard to find a reason to post as it does take a bit of time , especially if you want to make a thorough and informed post , even less so if you already made one before . 
  i think it 's simply inevitable . 
  no , you 're wrong , and here 's why . 
   [ propaganda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda ) is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument . 
  this does n't say you need more than one side present to the discussion * so long * as that side presents all sides of an ** argument ** . 
  in other words , who is saying what is not important , while * what * one is saying ** is ** . 
  while this may or may not be the case in the video linked , in any case , your comment has not shown that it has n't and is simply making a blanket accusation . 
  what ? 
  is it common for dvds to be region locked ? 
  they are in a way , see [ inverted totalitarianism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inverted_totalitarianism ) ( and in [ democracy incorporated ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/democracy-incorporated-managed-inverted-totalitarianism/dp/0691135665 ) by sheldon wolin ) . 
  actually , i do n't even think he 's racist , just trolling . 
  could be both , though . 
  i can tell you with certainty that romania * wo n't * catch up . 
  my bets would be on poland . 
  exactly , the behaviour of various romani ( especially ones that congregate in ` clans ' ) is inexcusable , but that does n't mean you have to start pogroms against them !, 
  and it 's not just gypsies , western countries have their own problems with specific ethnic minorities . 
  it 's a complicated issue and hard to solve , but violence is n't the way . 
  this is a good point too . 
  romania would totally turn extremist if it would profit the political elite , but alas , we are a moderate people and no one really cares . 
  which in this case works for the best , in others ... not so much . 
  would certainly explain why they go bust all the time . 
  you 're wrong , bec has counted 99,97 % of polling stations , it 's unlikely the rest will make a difference , regardless of how much the votes will be ( further ) rigged . 
  game over , brosky . 
  this one sounds great !, 
  haha , that 's awesome !, 
  ignore txampion , he 's a troll on this subreddit . 
  i 'm learning german and i love practicing listening with videos like this one , they 're quite fun !, 
  oh no , life is unbearable now that you ca n't mutilate a newborns genitalia . 
  let me get all the million of children in the world that are starving and dying of various easily preventable diseases and we 'll cry you a river . 
  fucking delusional people . 
  who said moldavia matters to romania ? 
  it 's old stuff . 
  most romanians are more pragmatic , if they were asked if they would want moldavia to be re-united with romania at the price of reduced standard of living they would tell you to fuck off instead . 
  sure , sometimes they 'll have week-end feelings of patriotism but they fade away by monday . 
  you give me a quote which has no relevance ( one , because if you have no money for tuition fees then it makes no difference as you wo n't pay anything for the tuition itself ; two , because if you say you wo n't afford living in the uk due to living costs then i ca n't see how you 'd do better in the other countries mentioned ) . 
  the thread was about the fact that fewer people go to uni because of rising fees . 
  you comment that because the tuition fees have gone up it is n't affordable for you anymore . 
  i 've tried explaining why the price of tuition would make no difference to how ` affordable ' studying in the uk is . 
  you 've also said you 'd rather go to germany/netherlands/whatever else . 
  all of those being countries which require * upfront * money when signing-up for each year , compared to a country where none is required of you ( based on student loans , afaik none of those countries offer full tuition loans for people not born there ) . 
  i 'm sorry but i will stop replying now . 
  if you want to play stupid that 's fine , i just ca n't be bothered to repeat myself over and over again . 
  i 'll explain for one last time : if you do n't reach a certain annual income then you do n't have to pay ** anything ** . 
  if you do reach a certain annual income then you 'll start paying a modest sum every month ( starts at # 30.00 / month ** edit : this is wrong , starts even smaller at around 7.5 a month ; not exactly a back-breaker though ** ) until the loan is payed off fully , in which case you * will * be able to pay your debt . 
  or to put it in an even simpler way : ** possibility 1 ** . 
  you take a student loan , but you 're broke . 
  =  it costs you 0 money . 
  you do n't take a student loan , but you 're broke . 
  =  it costs you 0 money .
