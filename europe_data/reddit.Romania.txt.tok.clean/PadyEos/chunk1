lidl does n't have toilets in romania either . 
  what were you guys thinking ? 
  no , just `` tourists '' . 
  hard to tell since i had to turn around a bit to observe the scene . 
  at that point he was about 3-4 meters away . 
  none of them had realized what exactly had happened yet . 
  the cop was looking for where the bullet hit instead of the casing and the guy did n't know what happened since he was hit by the casing in the upper part of the back of the head . 
  thankfully after a few more seconds the police officer realized the gun seemed to have been pointing down when it discharged and no one was hurt or worse by the bullet . 
  he must have been buried in paperwork for weeks after this ... 
  their nato , or eu members list seems to be `` incomplete '' to say the least . 
  ca n't really blame them since there 's so many countries . 
  there were some immigrants who accidentally crossed the border to romania instead of hungary who though they missed the eu and started crying . 
  not that i 'm complaining , i hope that they continue not realizing we exist . 
  the daily annoyances of traffic , loud neighbors , the gym or the boss at work are enough adrenaline for me . 
  not so hilarious live ... 
  the dude hit was bleeding . 
  do n't know . 
  i was just passing through and had another flight connection so i did n't stick around . 
  people did n't panic much or anything when they saw it was a police officer . 
  they calmed down almost before they had a chance to panic . 
  this was in december , after the paris attacks . 
  munich airport was full of police officers with handguns and submachine guns . 
  some of them really young , they looked like 16 ( probably were more close to 18-20 and i 'm just showing my age ) . 
  i 'm from romania . 
  they do n't even know we exist , i 'm feeling very safe . 
  the closest i 've gotten to terrorism was back in 2006 when a guy , romanian citizenship and ethnicity , who was nuts was caught driving with 2 home gas canisters in his car . 
  he wanted to `` bomb '' the city i live in . 
  he was caught about 900km away from the city and i was n't even there . 
  does being in close proximity of a german police officer accidentally discharging his handgun in munich airport last year and the casing hitting another romanian dude in the head count ? 
  i guess not ... 
   i have no idea whatsoever what we 're talking about and that exactly is the problem . 
  it 's not because we 're ignorant , or we do n't want to know . 
  they are keeping it secret . 
  in romanian it is `` poft\u0103 bun\u0103 '' virtually everywhere . 
  although in some rural regions you will hear old people say `` bogdaproste '' . 
  generally that come from bulgarian and has an old `` thank you for this meal '' ( to god and/or the host ) meaning in christian orthodox countries . 
  so this would be the last time this changed back in 2015 : http://www.realitatea.net/noi-planuri-rutiere--timisoara-fara-centura-si-autostrada-spre-belgrad--a6-devine-drum-expres_1609605.html i ca n't really be sympathetic to the always changing infrastructure plans of the government when i 'm coughing because of truck smoke and dust walking through the city . 
  i was talking about a n-s highway . 
  the eu tried to convince our government to make this highway twice before , on eu money , and the government found ways to not do it . 
  so no , i wo n't belive it until i actually see it finished . 
  and until the government in bucharest actually builds a ring road to the 3rd largest city ( that they 've been promising for 10 years on every election ) instead of ring roads for 20k cities , you can keep calling me `` provincial '' because i wo n't change my views on hollow words from the government but only on actions . 
  they ca n't really say no ... 
  but they 'll find one of their usual ways of delaying it . 
  yeah . 
  our government hates this . 
  they do n't want any highways in the vest of the country unless they lead to bucharest . 
  this it the 3rd attempt from the eu on forcing our government to make a highway from the north to the south of the country . 
  i hope they succeed because i live in that area ... 
  basarabia was part of the kingdom of moldova again from 1856 to 1878 and part of the kingdom of romania between 1918 and 1940 and then again from 1941 to 1944 . 
  after this a lot of moldavians moved , or even were moved , to transnistria since the ussr built most of the area 's industry there . 
  it 's not a simple history in this area , a buffer zone where many great kingdoms met , and it 's the same with the language . 
  linguistics is never simple . 
  especially for the romanian language simple explanations do n't work . 
  and russian influence or not the lady is speaking almost perfect romanian with only the accent being on the wrong part of the words . 
  also the period i was talking about is about 100 years long , longer than the period of russian influence . 
  seems shortsighted to discount it . 
  they do n't seem to since they bother having the news in both languages . 
  not quite . 
  it 's a bit more complicated . 
  in the 1850-1940 period `` president '' ( pronounced ` prezident ' , yes with a z ) was a very common pronunciation for `` presedinte '' ( english : president ) used by the lower and less educated classes . 
  french was all the rage at the time and it comes from the french `` pr\u00e9sident '' , written with an `` s '' and pronounced with a `` z '' : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pr%c3%a9sident this is highlighted by writers from the period , one famous ( in romania ) example is the writer [ i. l. caragiale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_luca_caragiale ) in some of his short stories and theater pieces . 
  `` president '' was used in his pieces by less educated characters when speaking about people in a presidential position , usually in politics , and it 's purpose was to highlight that the character has a less educated background , but wants to make it look like he fits into the educated crowd by using french words . 
  so the term that is still being used in transnistria probably has it 's origins in the common romanian before ww2 and was kept since it 's so close to the russian one anyway . 
  my mom had to bring her service pistol home when i was little . 
  i have held some of the bullets . 
  that was in the 90 's . 
  that and the occasional trip through the airport in basel and lately munich and walking near the central post office in my city when an armored car comes by is as close as i have gotten to one in my life . 
  can confirm . 
  the company i work for is hiring 500 programmers , it and support personnel in barcelona because they ca n't find people in germany or romania ( unemployment is like zero in those fields ) and switzerland is way too expensive . 
  was 1.28 % in the area i live in november 2015 , companies are starving for employees . 
  yet migrants believe there are n't jobs here and cry when they realize they 've missed hungary by 20km . 
  and they all got caught . 
  at least until spring we do n't have much to fear . 
  there is a tiny piece of the border with serbia that they can use to come in , that is easy to monitor . 
  the rest is the danube and mountains , in winter . 
  hey , we also did our [ part ] ( https://www.google.ro/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjdno39k7nkahwb3swkhbwnbscqygqimdab&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fmilitary_history_of_romania%23anti-ottoman_wars&amp;usg=afqjcnfwr1mzf9pv7u_axj81c0jzv2bgla&amp;sig2=d970dykuooluz1xxryipaq ) :(, 
  aaa . 
  that sounds like a normal day back then . 
  and i lived in a safer area of the city . 
  ofc it was n't like that 24/7 . 
  but you had these incidents and others , either on the news or someone told you about them , several times a week . 
  i still remember my dad when we entered the local market `` mind you pockets !, 
  keep your hands were your money is son ! '', 
  summer holidays were nicer , in the village next to the mountains or in a small town where most people knew each other . 
  i actually was interested and had a look for romania . 
  on a windy day , 10.03.2017 the production was : wind - 33 % hydro - 24.5 % nuclear - 20 % coal + solar - 22.5 % normal daily consumption in romania is ~ 8500mw/day and installed solar and wind capacity is currently 5000mw/day . 
  the gdp output of one on the regions grew by 56 % between 2012-2016 due almost entirely to installing wind turbines . 
  around ~ 500k around the country . 
  right at this moment all of them are singing the national anthem . 
  it 's already tradition every hour . 
  he accidentally spoke the truth . 
  in sibiu , a city of 150k , 40k are on the streets protesting right now . 
  that 's nuts . 
  edit : 300k just in the capital right now . 
  over 400.000 overall . 
  that is just insane for a people that were so apathetic for 27 years . 
  i am proud to be one of them . 
  sorry if i offended . 
  let me make it clear . 
  out of like 8-9 million living in towns maybe they find 100k drunkards and deranged pensioners .
