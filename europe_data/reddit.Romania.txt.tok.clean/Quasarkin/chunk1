you 've never been to romania , have you ? 
  i use the bucharest metro system . 
  it gets me anywhere in bucharest in less than 45 minutes . 
  it 's very effective and it is electric . 
  bucharest is currently undergoing full-time renovations and it looks that they are trying to implement a biking system along with it as well . 
  you can only get your bike on the metro on the weekend though . 
  i would also like to mention that the people using the metro system seem different to me . 
  they are unlike the people who use the bus or the tram . 
  i think they are more sophisticated and interesting . 
  maybe that 's just me . 
  i 'm surprised there 's no romanian post in here as of yet . 
  romanians are all about changing things in our country and you can usually hear about a billion things that each individual would change if they were in charge . 
  in any case , this is the first thing that i would change : -- & nbsp ; ## ** the educational system is flawed from the ground up . 
  ** & nbsp ; * the children have to assimilate an enormous amount of information in the span of their first 8 years . 
  it gets somewhat easier once you 're in high school but by then you 're already years behind on your curriculum . 
  * the students are not taught why the required curriculum is necessary for their future nor what it 's practical uses are . 
  it 's always about `` this is the problem and this is how you solve it '' and never about `` why should i solve the problem '' or `` why does the problem need solving '' . 
  it 's a very ` within-the-box ' thinking . 
  * physical education is not taken as serious as it should . 
  the programme usually allows for 1 hour of physical education per week but in the past even this has been done half-assed and seen by the kids as a `` free hour in school '' . 
  there have been some improvements in recent years ( in the main cities anyway ) but 1 hour a week is * clearly * not enough . 
  we used to have so much sportive talent in our country . 
  * we have a schedule made up of 6 hours of mathematics and 5 hours of romanian language and literature . 
  how are the students supposed to assimilate so much information ? 
  and do n't even get me started on the 32 hours of school per week schedule beginning with the 5th grade when the children are barely 11-12 years old . 
  it 's almost as if it 's a full-time job . 
  so much useless fucking information . 
  that 's when the children start to care less ; and less ; and less . 
  i will try to do so in the future . 
  thank you for your feedback . 
  much appreciated . 
  ** really . 
   initiated this is the key word that you seem to have a problem with . 
  and i 'm once again stating that i 'm merely quoting the news story that i put forward in the main post . 
  i 'm not adding anything on my own accord , i urge you to read the article and blame them instead . 
  thank you . 
  everything i wrote is taken from the articles that i linked . 
  and it 's a matter of fact that the impeachment procedure was initiated by members of opposing parties , not by some mystic voodoo shit , and that the leader of one of the opposing parties was in fact dan voiculescu . 
  ** romania ** -- * [ romanian mogul dan voiculescu got sentenced to 10 years in prison for fraud . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2719933/romanian-mogul-gets-10-years-prison-fraud.html ) he has claimed the case is politically motivated which that may very well be true since his television stations have been very critical of president traian basescu and he initiated the impeachment of the president on two occasions , in 2007 and 2012 . 
  since his conviction his television stations have turned to propaganda tactics similar to the communist era . 
  no one here will miss him . 
  * [ dan voiculescu 's television stations and other assets will be seized by the state . 
  ] ( http://anticoruptie.hotnews.ro/stiri-anticoruptie-17848964-sediile-antena-grivco-vor-confiscate-prin-decizia-curtii-apel-dosarul-ica.htm ) the state is presently waiting for the exact evaluation of voiculescu 's assets . 
  the amount of money they are looking to get is 3.515.756,4 usd + vat by seizing voiculescu 's grivco headquarters , the antena 3 tv station and his daughter 's money which voiculescu donated to in 2006 . 
  * [ klaus iohannis vows that he will win the presidency of romania if he is designated as a candidate . 
  ] ( http://revistapresei.hotnews.ro/stiri-radio_tv-17827655-klaus-iohannis-sunt-convins-daca-voi-desemnat-voi-castiga-presedintia-romaniei.htm ) he is expected to be announced as a candidate this month by the pnl ( national liberal party ) and will become one of the two main candidates , along with victor ponta , the incumbent prime-minster of romania . 
  * [ monica macovei has announced her independent candidacy for the presidency of romania . 
  an ally of president traian basescu , basescu has declared that he will not give her his support because she has been `` dishonest '' with him in the past . 
  she is expected to be a 3rd potential candidate to this two-man race for the presidency of romania . 
  i wish her good luck . 
  * [ new curriculum in schools for 2nd graders . 
  until now the children were required to know multiplication and division in the 3rd grade . 
  on top of that they will start using numbers from 1 to 1000 instead of 1 to 100 . 
  the teachers are saying this will be an educational failure . 
  some of these are clouds . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n3sg6mk.png ) is the definition of fog . 
  for shame , op . 
  for shame . 
  we once had a real naked girl on / r/rogonewild . 
  good times . 
  ** romania . 
  ** i know what you 're thinking . 
  why the fuck would i move to romania ? 
  so here 's a list of reasons to move to romania : -- * very cheap high speed internet . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  * sophisticated , beautiful women . 
  have n't you seen ? 
  * the architecture is an amalgamation of a million styles , old and new . 
  it never gets boring . 
  * very small rate of violent crimes . 
  2 % of all crimes are violent . 
  we have severe laws for this including no-weapons allowed . 
  literally , we 're not even allowed to carry around a knife to cut your apple . 
  * the people are very welcoming of foreigners because we love to make new friends and feed off of your personality . 
  we are after all , vampires . 
  * we have one of the most beautiful landscapes in europe . 
  visit / r/romaniaporn to witness how epic our country is . 
  no seriously , we 've got everything except a decent minimum wage . 
  * we get straight to the point . 
  we do n't beat around the bush . 
  if we 're asking you something , we want to know the answer to it !, 
  tell me your secrets dammit !, 
  * we are hardworking . 
  back in the days we did n't have much and the new generation wants to prove itself very much ; and we will prove it . 
  just watch . 
  * we have great sense of humor . 
  ironic and black , very similar to that in the uk . 
  just kidding , it 's shit but you 're going to laugh anyway . 
  -- also check this [ blog post ] ( http://pvewood.blogspot.ro/2013/04/25-reasons-why-i-love-living-in-romania.html ) because i think it does a much better job than me of explaining to you just how awesome romania is , despite what every single other romanian will tell you . 
  be wary of romanian opinions regarding romania . 
  very wary . 
  the old , noisy and uncomfortable ones have a lot of personality though . 
  i love them . 
  it really is n't . 
  and to this very day piracy is n't taken very seriously in romania . 
  they play football in europe therefore they are a part of europe . 
  they are the gatekeepers towards europe for syria and iraq so i 'm glad we have them . 
  apparently moldova was granted a visa-free entry to the schengen area on 28th april of this year , so that renders my comment void . 
  but yeah , a passport will do .
