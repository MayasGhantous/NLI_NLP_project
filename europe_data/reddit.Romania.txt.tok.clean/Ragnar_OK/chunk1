wtf does my mod application even have to do with the topic at hand ? 
  why they 'd do that ? 
  because they 're being treated like animals and rejected almost everywhere they go . 
  you want to turn people into extremists ? 
  treat them like dirt and then act like they 're ungrateful . 
  oh , man , that article from 1956 is amazing . 
   canadians for the most part have welcomed hungarian refugees to this country as heroic victims of a noble lost cause . 
  but , to our shame , occasional dissident voices have been heard to question and even to protest the efforts being made to bring the refugees here . 
  this unreasoning bigotry brings discredit to its possessors , but that is their concern ; more regrettable , it brings discredit to canada , since their clangerous views are given circulation . 
   the latest example of this selfishness was demonstrated by the town council of little current . 
  it decided to ignore a request from the northern ontarian hungarian relief organization to do what it could to help . 
  not content to be merely inhospitable , it embellished its boorish behaviour with slanderous remarks about the refugees . 
  the mood of the councillors was summed up by one of their number , mr alf cranston , who was quoted as saying : `` they ( the hungarians ) ca n't get along in their own country . 
  they will just make trouble here . '', 
   that is should be necessary to defend canada 's decision to given haven to refugees is lamentable . 
  but the task is easily done . 
  in the first place , the number who will come form an infinitesimal part of the new canadians who have settled here in the past decade -- not , as the critics are trying to make out , a huge mob which will somehow absorb canada instead of being absorbed . 
   this country welcomes and needs all the immigrants it can get . 
  it especially welcomes and needs people with the qualities of mind and heart exhibited by the hungarian people . 
  there is no need to recount the invaluable contribution made to canada 's development by the more than 1,000,000 immigrants who have come to this country since 1945 . 
  suffice it to say that our wage levels , standard of living and other barometers of prosperity have never been so high as now . 
  we have achieved all this not in spite of , but in part because of , the newcomers ' talents , skills and industry . 
   the argument that the hungarians will somehow get something for nothing -- and deprive native canadians in the doing -- is fatuous in the extreme . 
  by coming here , they acquire certain rights , with the rest of us . 
  they also acquire obligations : as soon as they earn money , pay rent , or make a purchase , they are paying taxes , with the rest of us . 
  in some instances they are penalized ; they are not eligible for old age pensions , for example , until they have been here twenty years , no matter how much they pay into the pension fund in the meantime . 
   the argument about new arrivals causing unemployment is so much clap-trap . 
  in addition to creating new jobs as consumers , many immigrants in the past ten years have begun successful enterprises of their own , employing significant numbers of canadians in the process . 
  they came not to take jobs but to make jobs . 
   the record of the past ten years reveals nothing to make anyone fearful of performing a simple of humanitarianism for people willing to risk their lives for freedom . 
  some of the critics now whining the loudest are not noted for taking many risks other than those involved in making a dollar in the quickest possible way . 
  for their own good , they should not risk drawing too much attention to their own contribution to the community 's or the nation 's development . 
  `` the country 's past has been plagued by priggish xenophobia ; let us for once live up to the standard of a truly civilized nation and meet the challenge of this glorious opportunity to serve freedom and mankind -- as well as ourselves . 
  +1 filantropica ; excellent , hilarious movie . 
   an extent that leads to your own people 's demise citation needed . 
  over half the migrants are from the balkans , and 99 % of them will be sent back . 
  muslim refugees count about 1/3rd of the total , with the rest being christian or secular ( again , from the balkans ) . 
  it 's a huge influx and it 's a problem that needs to be dealt with , but it ** absolutely ** will not spawn a new `` dark age '' or whatever the fuck else your deranged mind might come up with . 
  oooh , the refugees are ruining the core european values that we * just * finally managed to start this year !, 
  before this year we were like that , this year they are threatening this newfound superior european morality . 
  also , every letter in there is a link to a different article . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraine-gay-pride-parade-attacked-stones-smoke-bombs-1955426 ) is from this year . 
   reasonable things i 'm saying here that made me burst out laughing . 
  you really think that `` new dark age '' and `` you can be held as a political prisoner for saying the wrong thing * in canada * '' are * reasonable things to say * ? 
  you are spewing ** insanely ** paranoid shit . 
  you have nothing but paranoid delusions if you truly think these things while saying them to me over the internet . 
  like  evolving secular conversations and arguments on morality is , i.e. 
  slavery and its abolishment tell me more about what `` evolving arguments on morality '' say about helping people ? 
   no tolerance sure , just like there 's no tolerance of far-right extremist groups who pelt gay pride parades with rocks . 
  we 're so much better than those muslims , it 's not like the [ new right party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noua_dreapt%c4%83 ) can still exist as a party knowing their members , with orders from the party , beat people up for being gay . 
  romania 's part of europe , our values are clearly superior to those muslims who use violence to get their point across . 
  these groups exist in literally every country , and they have existed throughout europe for decades , nobody cared about `` no tolerance '' for those guys . 
  people laughed at them , sure , never took them seriously . 
  but that 's all they did as long as they did n't commit any crimes . 
  i do n't get what 's so different with refugees even if everything you assume about them is true . 
  canada is literally a dictatorial hellhole , is n't it ? 
   in europe we respect our women [ funny .

   `` hate speech '' laws that are in effect de facto blasphemy laws used to silence those who are n't part of the ruling class wait , you * actually * believe that ? 
   new dark age i 'm sorry , which part is n't an overreaction again ? 
  i read a comment in a different thread that said merkel is a `` hyperemotional leftist extremist '' , said completely earnestly , with people agreeing . 
  when you 're that far gone that you actually agree with wilders , it 's easy to convince yourself that `` the left '' does just about anything . 
  i agree . 
  i think a bit of regular nationalism is a good thing too , in fact . 
  i do n't think overreactions and paranoia and fear-mongering is ever a good thing , though . 
  i 'm not saying the situations are 1:1 , i 'm saying the reactions are : fearmongering , xenophobia , bigotry . 
  i can understand people being scared , i ca n't understand people making apocalyptic predictions i.e. 
  `` an invasion that threatens our prosperity , our security , our culture and identity '' . 
  is n't tolerance a core `` western value '' ? 
  actually , can you give me a comprehensive ( hell , even cohesive ) definition of `` western value '' ? 
  you know it 's bad when people think fucking wilders has the right idea . 
  it 's not the nationalistic tendencies that i disagree with , i think a fair bit of nationalism is a good thing . 
  it 's when it gets taken to the extreme , mixed in with a dose of fear and small-mindedness , that it becomes a bad thing . 
  my point is about overreacting , not against being nationalistic . 
  everything about this is the biggest overreaction since america went super crazy nationalistic after 9/11 . 
  the ~ ~ terrorists ~ ~ refugees are threatening our way of life !, 
   `` masses of young men in their twenties with beards singing allahu akbar across europe . 
  it 's an invasion that threatens our prosperity , our security , our culture and identity '' completely sane !, 
  it 's like he 's been getting his rhetoric from this sub . 
  it 's the same freedom of speech that allows people to criticize you . 
  it goes both ways on all issues . 
  yes , but i mean eu & germany already [ criticized hungary ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-hungary-migration-handling-pushback-human-rights-von-der-leyen/ ) , they 've made their position clear on the issue . 
  they ca n't force hungary to do anything , so they just scowl from across the room . 
   at least , uber has to declare everything , and pay taxes because of it . 
  uh , no they do n't . 
  they 100 % operate illegally in romania as unlicensed taxi services are against the law here ; they simply said `` cops need a warrant to check cars , so as long as our drivers follow the law , nobody has any right to check whether they 're working for us or just driving around '' . 
  honestly , what do you want the eu to do ? 
  they 're already saying hungary is literally hitler , it 's not like they 're gon na send troops in there to stop them from protecting their borders . 
  hungary 's enforcing eu law , not intentionally repressing people . 
  nobody is saying to sit idly by , but going from `` we need to do something about this '' to `` omg the terrorists are targeting our children and destroying our way of life '' is a huge fucking jump . 
  fearmongering that `` terrorists can get fake passports '' does nothing but add fuel to paranoia . 
  if you 're that scared of terrorism , stay in your house all day , getting hit by a car is waaay more likely to kill you . 
  again , the problem is * compulsory * quota . 
  there is already an agreement to redistribute 40k refugees . 
  key-word there is * agreement * . 
  oh , i agree , i think it 's really stupid to let your life be * this * governed by fear . 
  i think people are really not being rational right now , they 're letting themselves get way too caught up in the paranoia and fear-mongering . 
  no , but this time people realized that those * terrorists * can get them too !, 
  jesus christ , the reaction i see here is \\* exactly * the same reaction europe was laughing at in the early 2000s , after america went all gung-ho after 9/11 . 
  the same fearmongering , stupid people overreacting , ridiculously nationalistic rhetoric , even the fucking `` but our children ! '',
