  western europe invests in sports more than we do . 
  i completely agree , it 's a really stupid way of doing it , it 's like one of those decisions i 'd have expected from the communist government in romania in the 1980s . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  literally everything you said is provably wrong . 
  people go to church in the villages every sunday . 
  maybe not the cities , but most urban folks i 've met are n't exactly religious , and i 'm pretty sure that 's the case with western europe as well . 
  we had massive protests over here during the last president 's tenure , and during/after voting last year . 
  a few winters ago , there was a huge protest in bucharest during a blizzard . 
  cnslr-fr\u0103\u021bia , a politically-backed union , but a union nonetheless , has 800k members just by itself , and we have loads of unions here . 
  there 's even an it worker union in timisoara . 
  also , what does `` sporting or recreational organizations '' even mean ? 
  i play football with my mates at least once a week . 
  a ** lot ** of people i know go to football matches or concerts or theater or movies or whatever . 
  i think the difference is that most romanians feel by now that they 're helpless , because a lot of the country actually is . 
  i ca n't convince joe jerkoff in the middle of buttfuck , nowhere that ponta is corrupt if ponta 's party gives them `` aid '' during electoral season . 
  it 's not a * culture of corruption * , it 's poverty and lack of education . 
  and many of the ( previous and current ) governments ' decisions have been made to keep the population uneducated , because they know they 're easy to control . 
  i 'd love it if you could provide a source for even one of your claims , because it seems to me you 're talking out of your ass . 
  because `` cheaper food '' does n't mean anything if it 's coming in from china ( or wherever ) , in this case . 
  the greek government , the way i understood it , wanted to keep the internal producers relevant in the face of cheaper external goods . 
  no , i 'm not worried about anything - i genuinely did n't understand what you were trying to say . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  i do n't even get what you 're supposed to satirize with your comment . 
  i ca n't make heads or tails of it , can you please explain what you mean ? 
   do you think that the fight against corruption in romania has itself become corrupt in a way and is being used to abolish or achieve the wrong things , in the interest of a corrupt political or economic elite ( or certain voter groups ) ? 
  i do n't know what the guy you asked this thinks , but i can say that for me and most of the people i know , the fight against corruption is stronger than ever , and i do n't think it was corrupted in any way . 
  it only seems like psd is targeted more because they 're the most corrupt . 
  well , again , i think you 're wrong and our country , along with many others from our region , have proved you wrong . 
  sure , in an ideal world , the government will work to make sure the entire country is more prosperous , but reality has shown everybody time and time again that nothing is more important to the people running a country than money and power ( at least in our general geographic location ) . 
  there are a few countries that get it right , but the majority look at people as numbers and nothing more . 
  i think you 're wrong , and it depends on the country you 're talking about . 
  i do n't think many would have a lot of objections about that statement if it were made about russia or china or even some african countries . 
  obviously it 's not true of everywhere , but not pointing it out where it * is * true wo n't serve anyone except the oligarchies . 
  i still fail to see how it 's `` dehumanizing '' . 
  can you please expand on that point for me , maybe i 'm missing some information . 
  i do n't understand what you mean by `` dehumanization '' . 
  could you please expand on that ? 
  i know it used to be the same way in romania too . 
  when she had me , my mother had to pay $ 50 to get a private room and then another $ 100 to the various nurses and doctors that tended in order to get them to take care of her . 
  it does n't matter anyway , because planeth 's prices are wrong , there 's only a few `` low-class '' bars in bucharest that sell 0.5 l beer for under 1 euro . 
  most places in the center of town charge anywhere between 2 and 4 . 
  0.56 euro is corner-store price , not pub price . 
  they 're still not great compared to western europe , but most of the salaries at my company are between the 1500 - 3000 euro mark for developers . 
  even qa gets about 1000 euros for a senior position , even more for an automator position . 
  that 's the reason why we get so many openings over here in the first place . 
  in belgium or france , for example , some of my coworkers would easily be making 40-50 thousand euros per year , so the big companies can afford to pay them 30k / year and keep them in romania . 
  they save money and provide jobs . 
  it 's really provided some great sustainable growth for romania , and done wonders for urban youth employment . 
  honestly , it feels like everybody is hiring developers in bucharest right now . 
  they 're even offering hundreds and thousands of dollars in compensation for recommending someone at my company . 
  testers , sysadmins , python , java , . net developers , most companies have at least a few positions opened for each over here . 
  we 've got both gaming companies , like ea or ubisoft , but also major software corporations , like ibm and adobe over here , as well as local start-ups like bitdefender . 
  the it market is absolutely booming in romania , and that 's thanks to some shrewd , smart reforms by the last few governments . 
  and what 's the minimum salary in greece ? 
  because in romania it 's 200 euros / month . 
  haha wow . 
  this whole situation deserves to be made into a scorsese movie :p, 
  well , it 's true though , but he just meant `` if people abroad hear how hardcore dna is , then people will be more reticent to deal with my corrupt ass '' so in a sense he was right . 
  these actions are damaging the image that they wanted it to have - corrupt country where you can just pay the bigwigs to get whatever you want . 
  if this image is changed , they wo n't be able to steal as much anymore , and none of 'em want that . 
  paywall 'd . 
  goddamn it , 0.39 % ?!, 
  why are banks taxed so little ? 
  i have to pay around 40 % tax off my gross income . 
  i feel so left out :'( beautiful video , though !, 
  absolutely stunning . 
  lol farage telling tsipras to quit euro . 
  even tsipras is unimpressed . 
  hahaha , it just takes one wrong word for it to descend into [ utter chaos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me3gwzk4aeo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=111 ), 
  holy shit , webber is absolutely burying tsipras . 
  i 'm expecting him to end it with `` so that 's why i 'll fight you in the cage this sunday on the wwe network ! '', 
  yes , and you think any civilized country nowadays would accept to live as they did in the 1800s ? 
  christ , i hope so !, 
  i think dna set an excellent record with elena udrea being arrested after the whole mess behind [ gala bute ] ( http://www.romaniajournal.ro/elena-udrea-can-be-arrested-in-bute-gala-case/ ) . 
  hopefully they 'll pursue the same justice once the euro 2020 bid comes to attention . 
  that 's exactly the problem - they left it to the individual countries , because they always have other options in europe , and have basically opened the floodgates of `` oh , yeah , let me award this multi-billion dollar contract to build infrastructure to my cousin 's brother 's third nephew 's company , that 's best for romania ! '', 
  that 's what they 've always done when nobody was looking , and that 's what they 'll do in this case , since uefa is n't directly invested in this case , because it 's a `` pan-european '' event . 
  there 's too many different bureaucracies to go through for a united event , it 's just easier for them to leave it up to whoever . 
  i think it 's short-sighted on their part . 
  and our politicians are jackals , they 've jumped at the opportunity . 
  i think i can shed some like on your edit . 
  from what i 've seen on here and at my job , most young people see expats as `` quitters '' who needed foreign intervention because they were stupid and have a victim complex , instead of staying here and trying to fix the problem . 
  it 's like an ultra-conservative ( in the american sense ) view on the world and it 's really baffling to me . 
  i do n't know about any other countries , though , it 's just what i 've noticed over here . 
  i 'm guessing the difference between eastern europeans over here vs over there is that the ones over there had the time and acceptance to take in other points of view and to develop some human empathy . 
  because the majority view over here is `` we went through that , what makes the greek think they 're better than us ? '', 
  which is insane to me - it 's like they 're not satisfied until everybody goes through the same indignities . 
  i ca n't wait for this lying , corrupt jerkface to go to jail . 
  i think it is when the narrative presented is that they did it intentionally . 
  oh , i agree it 's a very simplistic view , that i disagree with , maybe i should have made my point clearer . 
  i was just saying - that 's how a lot people living here and neighboring countries see the situation . 
  oh , man , that 's why i 'm so worried about romania hosting matches at euro 2020 . 
  we only have a single stadium over 30k seats , and our infrastructure completely wo n't be able to handle it . 
  it can barely handle regular romanian traffic , the increased activity of hosting euro 2020 would completely cripple us . 
  the government was supposed to build a metro from the airport to the stadium , ** 12 km ** until then , but they have n't even started . 
  the same country that took 5 years to build a 2km bridge is supposed to build 12 km of subway in that same period . 
  and they have n't even started . 
  it 's such a stupid endeavor that it 's obvious to everybody that it 's only another scheme to steal more money , and it outrages me that nobody else over here wants to do something about it . 
  well , sort of ? 
  at least in my opinion .
