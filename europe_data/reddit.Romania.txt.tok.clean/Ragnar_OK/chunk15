  we 've seen the failure of unchecked immigration coupled with unwillingness to integrate time and time again ( both gypsies within romania and muslim immigrants in france , germany or scandinavian countries ) , and anybody with eyes and a brain can see that it will lead to nothing good . 
  edit : i realize that `` economic refugee status '' is n't an actual thing . 
  i meant it more like offer refugee status to people who come here directly from wartorn countries . 
  people who move to europe from , like , egypt or morocco and claim refugee status are coming here from peaceful nations - they 've already reached safety , they have no reason to come here except to take advantage of the economic opportunities offered by europe . 
  i 'm not saying immigration should be completely stopped , but way too many people are taking advantage of the `` refugee '' status just so they can skip out on following immigration procedure . 
  as long as people follow the legal procedure and attempt to integrate , i have absolutely no problem with immigration . 
  oh , yeah , because generalizations and hyperbole are so much better . 
  `` leftist dream '' my ass . 
  i know , right ? 
  it 's always been my dream as a bleeding-heart to live in a sharia-law middle-eastern shithole , that is literally what all liberals want to happen in europe !, 
  wtf why ?!, 
  that 's fucking stupid , why would italy have to pay reparations to illegal immigrants ? 
   the left [ ... ] they 'd rather side with islamists than give up pc bullshit . 
  christ , i hate these generalizations . 
  i 'm hardcore bleeding-heart liberal , and i 'm against unchecked immigration , especially against people who do n't even attempt to integrate ( muslims being the clearest offenders ) . 
  the current immigration requirements are way too lax in my opinion , and they need to be tightened up across the board , and i 'd do away with `` economic refugee '' status completely , as well as create a european institution to check the situation of all supposed refugees that come to the eu . 
  i do n't know if they already do it , but i 'd make language and history tests mandatory when asking for citizenship . 
  most left-leaning people i know think about the same , even our leftist , populist government is against unchecked immigration . 
  it 's basic common sense to want to protect your national integrity in any way possible in my opinion . 
  that being said , i have no problem with immigrants that attempt to integrate . 
  i 've met some perfectly fine african immigrants in bucharest , who came here to work , and they both seemed happy to be here and to attempt to integrate in our culture . 
  i have no problem with those people , and i ca n't think of many reasons why anybody would . 
  an influx of immigrants is not by itself the problem imo . 
  huge influx of immigrants who try to change europe so it 's more like the shithole they left is what the problem is . 
  we 've seen the failure of unchecked immigration coupled with unwillingness to integrate time and time again ( both gypsies within romania and muslim immigrants in france , germany or scandinavian countries ) , and anybody with eyes and a brain can see that it will lead to nothing good . 
  oh , yeah , i totally get that , the taxi system needs to be overhauled completely , i 'm not disputing that . 
  i just think it really sucks that we might not even get a better choice or even an actual competitor to uber because they 're doing their best to stifle the competition . 
  they 're just as bad as the taxi companies from that point of view imo . 
  i would say they 're even worse than the cab companies in some ways , because they always have access to your location once you 've installed their app . 
  [ and they 've demonstrated this ability ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/10/03/god-view-uber-allegedly-stalked-users-for-party-goers-viewing-pleasure/ ) . 
   but it 's not how they generally do business . 
  they got discovered doing it in january 2014 , then they apologized . 
  they then again got discovered doing it in august 2014 , and then they apologized again . 
  then they stopped doing it themselves and * hired a company to do it for them * , i 'd say it 's standard operating procedure for them by now . 
  speaking of shady shit , uber vp [ suggested that uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists , with a million-dollar budget , to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about uber ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists#.denj5aqgpv ) . 
  edit : also , [ uber does n't give a shit about your privacy ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/10/03/god-view-uber-allegedly-stalked-users-for-party-goers-viewing-pleasure/ ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not opposed to the concept itself , i agree that the taxi system should be overhauled - it 's uber that is terrible and i wish they 'd go away . 
  oh , man , you should come to bucharest , at least 4 out of every 10 cars you see on the street is a taxi . 
  we have tens of thousands of them here !, 
  then again , cabs are really cheap in . ro ( about 30c / km ) , so there 's plenty of demand to begin with . 
   open competition lol uber has done some insanely shady shit to stifle competition . 
  hundreds of uber employees would intentionally start ordering cars from rival startups and then cancelling them just so they could waste everybody 's time and money :  uber issued an apology on january 24 , 2014 , after documents were leaked to the valleywag and techcrunch publications saying that , earlier in the month , uber employees in new york city deliberately ordered rides from gett , a newly established competitor , only to cancel them later . 
  the purpose of the fake orders was two-fold : wasting drivers ' time to obstruct legitimate customers from securing a car , and offered drivers incentives -- including cash -- to join uber . 
   in august 2014 , lyft , another ridesharing service , reported to cnnmoney that 177 uber employees had ordered and cancelled approximately 5,560 rides since october 2013 , and that it had found links to uber recruiters by cross-referencing the phone numbers involved . 
  the cnn money report identified one lyft passenger who canceled 300 rides from may 26 to june 10 , 2014 , and who was identified as an uber recruiter by seven different lyft drivers . 
  --  if you get rich by actually doing a good job im fine with it , but if it 's from political favours then you can get fucked . 
  completely 100 % agree with you , except these people are getting rich not because they 're better than their competition , they 're rich because they fucked up their competition with terrible business practices . 
  hell , once they got caught fucking with lyft , they [ hired a company to do it for them ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/26/6067663/this-is-ubers-playbook-for-sabotaging-lyft ) . 
   they deliver better and cheaper service i do n't know how taxis operate in denmark that they can get rich off it , i know several cab drivers in romania , and none of them are in any way rich . 
  maybe cabs are super expensive over there , so i 'll concede `` cheaper '' , but better ? 
  i do n't know , i 've never used uber , but i 'd totally trust a licensed driver way more than i would an uber driver . 
  man , it 's not even funny . 
  uber has some of the worst business practices i 've ever seen . 
  speculative pricing hikes , sabotaging competitors , anti-worker practices , threatening journalists - and even hiring teams of pis to keep a close eye on journalists criticizing them , complete lack of respect for user privacy ( even moreso - they got hacked in sometime in 2014 , they discovered in september and only announced it in feb 2015 ; names and license plates of over 50k people were acquired ) , industrial espionage ... how nobody blinks an eye at an entire history of nefariousness , i 'll never understand . 
  what are you talking about , the guys that own uber are worth over $ 1 bil. , and they are terrible fucking people . 
  uber as a company has some of the most terrible business practices i 've ever seen . 
  that 's an excellent idea regardless of the wage gap - parenting leave imo should be extended for both genders . 
  but the wage gap is n't a simple problem with a simple solution , it 's a complex issue with multiple facets , all of which have to be addressed before a solution is reached . 
  a `` simple solution '' will only scratch the surface and would n't solve the underlying problems . 
  you 're assuming markets are totally rational and totally efficient . 
  the reality is that they are neither . 
  the difference in wages for men and women is not enough to have that big an impact on a company 's bottom line . 
  the reality is that most hiring managers are still men , and there 's still a stereotype about men versus women in the workplace . 
  the prejudices are strong enough to influence actions and the difference in value for pay is n't big enough to force a change . 
  the scientific study i linked to a few comments above targets this exact question . 
  according to [ different studies ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/12/managers-avoid-hiring-younger-women-maternity-leave ) , managers generally tend to prefer hiring males based on the assumption that women might have children and take maternity leave in the future . 
  in a case like this , prejudices overpower pure capitalism , unfortunately . 
  both average wages and living costs are higher . 
  minimum wage in . ro is 200 euros , does that make the suffering of the greek people any less real ? 
  does empathy end at the point where others make more than you ? 
  besides , i 'm not answering your `` question '' because it 's stupid and has no basis in reality . 
  your simplistic interpretation of the facts is n't worth acknowledgement . 
  no , no , i meant that your understanding of it is the opposite of what it 's supposed to do . 
  every time a pilot program like this was tested out , it lead to increased economic activity and better living standards , with minimal-to-no reduction in work effort . 
  [ read about it ] ( http://www.guystanding.com/files/documents/basic_income_pilots_in_india_note_for_inaugural.pdf ) , it 's pretty interesting . 
  yes !, 
  cast that blame , does n't it feel good ? 
  judging and feeling superior and smug over an entire country where a lot of people ca n't even afford food is great , amirite ? 
   the solutions which you 're advocating are not improoving the numbers and standars of employment , they 're just promoting unemployed people living on welfare . 
  that is literally the opposite of what it 's supposed to do . 
  so data that shows that in literally all interviewed occupations and across all spectra of earning brackets women make less than men does not support the conclusion that women are paid less than men ? 
  or is this where occam 's razor no longer applies ? 
  edit : and , further , wanting women to be paid equally to men is somehow inherently wrong in your view ( from what i gather from your words , at least ) , can you explain to me why that is ? 
  oh , do n't get me wrong - i agree with that , i 'm just saying that it 's how it 's viewed by a lot of people , especially middle-aged people , around here . 
  alright , let 's say it 's true , and you 're right ( and you 're obviously not , you ca n't apply occam 's razor to a complex socioeconomic issue - but your bullshit logic aside , i want to address another issue i have with people like you ) . 
  why would the us government , they performed the study mind-you , lie about it ? 
  what possible reason would they have to do that ? 
  that 's just how it 's seen over here , though . 
  it 's a mentality of `` what are you gon na ' do , take on the international corporation and think * you 'll win * ?! '', 
  so it 's a sort of accepted part of the cut-throat business that capitalism is , so to speak . 
   facts are facts . 
  bahahahaha that is fucking hilarious , when the first and third `` sources '' you posted have `` opinion '' right at the start of the posting . 
  the huffingtonpost one is a blog post . 
  but most hilariously , the now.org link you posted actually ** refutes your own point , dumbass ** . 
  your argument is bullshit . 
  the us government did the study , and they [ totally 100 % took into consideration what jobs they had ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/us_womens_earnings_and_employment_by_industry_2009.png ) . 
  the wage gap is a real thing , and [ women 's career choices ca n't explain it away ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-14/women-make-less-than-men-even-when-they-are-equally-qualified-mbas ) . 
  besides , it 's something intrinsic - [ a real , actual scientific study ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/2012/09/23/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/ ) showed that when presented with the same cv , employers offered the one with the name `` jane '' [ ~ $ 5000 less than the ones with the name `` john '' ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/files/2012/09/gender-bias-figure-2.jpg ) on them . 
  that was a very interesting story !, 
  y' know , i 've worked with a bunch of other nationalities ( english , american , danish , hell , even pakistani or brazilian , possible thanks to working in an international conglomerate ) , and i 've never encountered this sort of arrogance from foreigners .
