  jesus , man , take your tinfoil hat off . 
  excellent way to prove exactly my point , by the way . 
  y' know , we do n't really pass the buck to anybody . 
  we 're just not a target in the first place , romania has seen almost no uptick in asylum-seekers . 
  the government over here promised to help , but so far nobody ( as far as i know ) has been sent our way . 
  they did it [ earlier this year ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/ecb-decision-to-weaken-euro-comes-with-pluses-and-minuses-a-1015322.html ), 
  this is the stupidest `` celebration '' ever . 
  50 years of communism have turned betraying our allies into a `` day of national celebration '' ; we even used to have the national stadium in bucharest referred to as the 23 ^ rd of august stadium . 
  honestly , this really is n't a thing to celebrate or be proud of . 
  we were faced with 2 terrible choices and , overall , we took the smaller evil , but that 's in no way admirable or worthy of celebration . 
  honestly , i really hate that about this sub sometimes . 
  i 've seen americans who made excellent points get downvoted and discarded out of hand for `` this aint the us m8 '' , as if that automatically discounts your point of view . 
  what worked ? 
  bulgaria never had a high number of economic `` refugees '' ( which i agree are a problem ) or even regular refugees in the first place . 
  * at most * it was used as a passing point towards france or germany . 
  hell , or even hungary . 
  they built the fence * in expectation * of an influx , which never came . 
  romania did nothing of the sort , and we still have n't seen any meaningful rise in illegal immigrants - because we were never a target in the first place , just like bulgaria is n't either . 
  saying that the fence had any sort of meaningful impact is outright not understanding the social , political or economic reality of europe . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , i just disagree with gunning people down when you have other choices ( like tear gas ) . 
  and my personal opinion is that there always should be other choices when it comes to a bunch of desperate people rather than shooting them dead . 
  tear gas , water cannons , segregation from general populace , basically ( almost ) anything that does n't end with the death of another human . 
  are you american by chance ? 
  no offense meant ( i.e. 
  discounting your opinion based on your nationality ) , but i see this `` deterrent '' type of mentality a lot from americans - and it 's a view i completely 100 % disagree with since it 's been proven to not work . 
  well , i do n't really agree with shooting them . 
  these are still human beings , and i do n't think anybody should be killed for trying to find a better life - illegally or not . 
   stick them in solitary confinement you are advocating cruelty for no reason . 
  psch , see , you 've been brainwashed . 
  civilization [ literally started in romania ] ( http://humansarefree.com/2010/11/true-history-lessons.html ) !, 
  you did n't know , but ancient dacians invented the latin language , they were the first people on the moon , arsenie boca is the closest humanity will ever get to an orthodox pope superstar , the balkans are half as civilized as we are and we literally invented technology . 
  all of it . 
   such wealth [ indeed ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=tigani&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmivlsdmse6xwivcz8uch0fnqpi&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=930#tbm=isch&amp;q=tigani+lux ), 
  it 's just a formula that calculates the `` weight '' of recent results . 
  it really does n't reflect reality , i agree , but it 's not really supposed to - just general result trends . 
  because english is the de facto lingua franca right now . 
  romania is doing quite well nowadays , though - we 're [ # 7 in fifa 's standings !, 
  ] ( http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ ), 
  [ me_irl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tck0mygnhjo ), 
  france did something that was hilarious ( to me , at least ) - they gave $ 300 euros and paid for planes back to romania for all the illegal rromas that they caught . 
  the only thing they managed to do was give them money to pay for their own way back to france . 
  oh , man , you really need to watch the mario bros movie , it 's insanely terrible . 
  i completely recommend watching it with rifftrax . 
  damn , that 's some inflammatory language . 
  plunder . 
  looting . 
  `` agreement '' . 
  it does n't even try to be an actual analysis , it starts from the conclusion that germany is evil and then builds the rest of the blogpost around that . 
  next they 'll accuse germany of salting the earth and burning greece 's barns and killing their livestock . 
  any anglophone country . 
  more people in romania need to speak english . 
  it sucks that all this is happening , but ...  large numbers spent the night stuck on macedonia 's southern frontier , and tried to charge police in the morning . 
  i mean , hundreds / thousands of people charging at you makes it pretty understandable that they used tear gas , as regrettable as the entire situation is . 
  i have almost no idea what 's going on in turkey , what 's all this about , can someone break it down for me please ? 
   i might as well say that `` the us https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism, 
  he looks like kingpin from spiderman cartoons . 
  well , it answers the `` what your country is '' part of the question . 
  the other one is also simple , `` looks like a fish , above greece '', 
  `` oh , i always wanted to visit bulgaria ! '', 
  super simple , just say `` dracula '' and everybody instantly knows . 
   number of rapes in sweden since they started multikulturalising themselves christ , i hate seeing this shit parroted by stupid people who have no fucking clue what they 're talking about . 
  the number has increased , you bigoted fuck , because since 2005 the definition of rape in sweden has been [ expanded to include many more situations ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372 ) that just `` forced vaginal penetration '' . 
  more than that , every single instance of sexual assault is recorded individually - if a woman is raped 3 times by the same person , 3 new cases will be opened instead of 1 containing all them . 
  reminds me of that scene from arrested development where jim cramer upgrades bluth stock from `` sell '' to `` do n't buy '' . 
  i think it meant to say `` relocating '' instead of `` relating '' . 
  `` oh , just 19 people missing ? 
  psch , big deal , i 'll only acknowledge it when it 's over 1000 ! '', 
  as reality as we know it continues to disintegrate around us , can we expect eldritch horrors from the beyond to rise up and claim their thrones above humanity ? 
  it totally exceeds the rise in cost of living . 
  i 'm earning a lot more than that now - i got lucky and got a job right out of highschool for a major it company which set me on a great career path - but a $ 600 / month salary is still pretty good for bucharest , which is by far the most expensive city in the country . 
  $ 600 does n't mean as much nowadays as it did 7 years ago , but you can still live pretty comfortably with it . 
  though , when i started working , i was only making about $ 350 / month , which was about the median wage . 
  for comparison , right now the median wage in romania is ~ $ 450 . 
  but it salaries in romania rival western europe . 
  a programmer can easily earn $ 2000 / month or more at any of the major it companies active in bucharest . 
  the article itself is n't bad , but the way the title is phrased , and the adversarial way in which lagarde is presented makes no sense . 
  varoufakis did n't make any outlandish statements that nobody believed - just that by its own rules , imf ca n't be involved . 
  i fail to see what the vindication is . 
   are your wages going up in bucharest , completely and unequivocally yes . 
  when i started working in 2008 a good salary was considered anything over $ 600 . 
  nowadays , $ 600 is considered entry-level salary at the same company . 
  romania - most popular musicians nowadays are actually masons who worship satan and serve nwo and are doing all they can to brainwash our country 's youth . 
  it 's not the * top * conspiracy theory , but plenty of people believe it . 
  mostly stupid people , but we have plenty of those . 
  wooo , romania can finally into western europe !, 
  my mother went to turkey for vacation a couple of years ago - she ended up spending ~ $ 250 for a 4 day vacation , lodging included . 
  she stayed at a pension , so it cost a lot less than a hotel room , but she still spent about half what she would have in romania , even if she stayed at a pension over here . 
  you 're very welcome , friend !, 
  let me know if i can do anything else for you . 
  no way , man , bulgarian beaches are 3x more beautiful than romanian beaches imo . 
  hell , romanians are going to bulgaria for vacation nowadays , prices over here are fucking stupid . 
  hotels on the romanian seaside would rather have empty rooms than lower the prices a bit . 
  man , not even 10 years . 
  it wages are super high in romania * right now * , you can fairly easily get a $ 24000 - 36000 / year net salary in bucharest working as a programmer . 
  enough money to live in western europe , enough money to be pretty fucking rich in bucharest . 
  that might be true , romania has a major victim complex ( myself included , as exemplified by these comments ) . 
   when you say the uk , i think you mean our government . 
  i meant the government , private newspapers and tv stations were all involved in what was seen over here as a denigration campaign against romania and bulgaria . 
  i only saw the first part of the documentary . 
  i realize the average british person does n't feel that way and had nothing to do with that campaign .
