  they 're always talking about each other , throwing small passive-aggressive barbs ... it 's clear they want each other !, 
  so personal responsibility does n't mean anything , because you were * forced * to drink more than you should . 
  and also * forced * to act like a bellend . 
  i was thinking something more along the lines of alpha protocol or sid meier 's pirates !, 
  than a telltale game . 
   a weak euro is beneficial to countries that the real exchange rates of their economies are much lower than the euro , so you 're telling me it 's beneficial to the countries that have to pay more , and not to the countries that receive more money ? 
  right ... 
  i think that 's because germany basically sets policy , so everybody looks to them to fix the problems they cause . 
  the recent euro-weakening was done almost solely for the benefit of germany - incidentally , to the detriment of greece . 
  i do n't think it was a coincidence in the context , and i would n't put it past the germany-oriented ecb to do it for exactly that reason . 
  i think this is the conclusion that most pro-eu people ( like me ) have come to during this greek crisis . 
  if you want the eu to succeed , you ca n't just let it continue with the same policies as it has been . 
  it needs some reforms , and it needs to be less germany-focused , but i still truly believe in the ideals of the european union . 
  there needs to be more closer cooperation , a bit more understanding , and a whole lot more oversight . 
  y' know , semi-related to the subject , i 'm surprised that more games do n't use this setting . 
  to me , the lawlessness and inherent danger of working in the `` high seas '' seems like it would make a great background for an action-adventure or an rpg game . 
  i 'm not even opposed to the idea of a `` trigger warning '' , as it can be very useful for people who actually * do * suffer from ptsd . 
  but the way it 's used nowadays is less `` this serves a purpose '' and more `` i do n't want to be confronted by differing opinions . '', 
  man , when you have a website like thuisbezorgd.nl , i 'll believe that . 
  i wish romania had a centralized fast-food network like that !, 
  maybe they just meant us-based outlets ? 
  does n't russia also have a pretty big muslim minority ? 
  i swear , switzerland is the smartest country in the world - getting paid to make more money !, 
  they 'll never see it coming !, 
  so they 're like the tea party of germany ? 
  nowhere directly , but the talk of `` export market '' was clearly directed at germany . 
  at least , in my opinion . 
  if not , my bad , i take it back . 
  sure you can , at least then you can aim high yet realistic !, 
  can i just choose english ? 
  so , in the end , it 's not about `` what 's better '' , it 's all about national interest . 
  which is exactly what germany is doing , and is what the us is doing , yet you 're only blaming germany for it . 
  eu is not a federal state , so the same rules do n't apply , but you 're still trying to conflate them . 
  see , it 's exactly this type of mentality that annoys so many of the poorer eu countries . 
  this `` well , we 're rich , you ca n't expect us to just be poor ! '', 
  line of thinking , while the rest of us had to sit on the sidelines hoping the eu would do for us like they did for you . 
  now that you 're in the same position that a lot of post-communist states were , you act like you 're above it , while nobody did shit for us while we were trying to get ourselves together . 
  of course , i realize this is n't your fault , and that it 's insane to blame the greek population of that , but i 'm just saying - that 's one of the majority views when it comes to poorer eu countries in regards to the greek crisis . 
  oh , shit , my bad , i need to pay more attention . 
  yeah , i know , i just made a bad joke . 
  the ron has had about the same value compared to the euro for about 3 years now , it 's by far the most stable it 's ever been . 
  easy to talk from the sidelines ( i know , i do it too ) and say `` yeah , if i were involved , i would have done this '' , while refusing to actually get involved . 
  anaf ( romanian tax authority ) is [ great at weeding out tax fraud and tax evasion ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanias-tax-authority-eur-1-bln-tax-evasion-five-months/151478/ ) . 
  and they 're completely separate from dna . 
  honestly , why would you build your village on the hills when there 's a plain right behind it ? 
  it looks wonderful , though . 
  more than that , though , i think europe would be fucked by the supermutants , since guns are n't as widespread over here as they are in usa . 
  hey , worst comes to worst , we can get that fallout universe that is so [ interesting in video games !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtbyud1juc4 ), 
  oh , since it happened over the course of several centuries , does it mean that the french revolution is also in question ? 
  the one that was several orders of magnitude worse in violence than the romanian revolution ? 
  or is robespierre beyond your arbitrarily chosen time frame ? 
  edit : wait , the fact that i gave actual sources while you gave * none * is also `` butthurt feelings '' ? 
  also , yet * again * you skip over my argument ( poverty and lack of education , not `` culture '' ) and just go for something else completely . 
  which is because , in my opinion , you have no actual argument beyond `` corruption is cultural because reasons '' . 
   when have hundreds of thousands gathered to demand better schools , or better healthcare . 
  when have hundreds of thousands gathered to demand an end to the corruption and incompetence that has made millions of them leave their country for another ? 
  when did that happen in western europe ? 
  again , you skip over my * actual * argument . 
  ok , so what 's a `` proactive protest '' then ? 
  a protest is , by definition , a reactive gesture . 
   in most cases try to come up with even vaguer terms to defend your position , please . 
  i mean , when you 're proven wrong and do n't give any sources for your claims , the next step is even more nebulous terminology , right ? 
   only an utter imbecile would take [ ... ] you 're again shifting the goalposts . 
  you said , and i quote ,  when has there ever been a case of hundreds of thousands of citizens coming together to defend their rights ? 
  never . 
  and when i proved you wrong , you changed your argument . 
   btw , what were the results of this revolution ? 
  oh , that 's right . 
  the former communist nomenclature ( after swift re-branding ) took over power . 
  yes , i agree with that , maybe if you 'd have made * this * as your initial point instead of `` corruption is cultural '' , i would n't have answered you in this fashion in the first place . 
   unlike some other people that have to be babied by an overbearing government . 
  wow . 
  you really think the romanian government `` babies '' us ? 
  i 'm not denying romania has issues , it 's immediately obvious even to the blind . 
  what i 'm opposed to is this ( in my opinion , extremely stupid ) notion that romanians take everything laying down . 
  sure , it might have been the case 20-30-40 years ago , but to outright deny the fact that romania 's ( educated ) youth has n't been trying to make romania better by whatever ways they have at their disposal is not only immensely patronizing , it 's down-right dehumanizing . 
  you 're telling me that i 'm corrupt because it 's my `` culture '' , instead of taking the time and trying to * understand * . 
  you skipped right over my argument about lack of education and poverty , and jumped straight to `` it 's cultural '' . 
  so all the [ rosia montana ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=proteste+rosia+montana&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmiup61s77yxgivhklych2veac6&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=930 ) protests were just a wank , then ? 
  my attending them , along with literally tens of thousands of other people throughout the country , makes me and the people who actually care enough to do it , what , mewling children when compared to western europe ? 
  edit : what about the smurd protests ? 
  did those not have any effect either ? 
  i do n't know if you 're intentionally dishonest or you 're just really poorly informed , but  your `` massive protests '' never numbered more than several hundreds in most cases . 
  thousands at a national level . 
  i ca n't decide if you 're really stupid or just trying to paint a wrong picture of romania for some reason .

   when has there ever been a case of hundreds of thousands of citizens coming together to defend their rights ? 
  never . 
  i 'm guessing you 've never heard of the 1989 revolution or the student protests / mineriads of the early 90s . 
  would n't blame you , you 're the type of person who thinks `` corruption is cultural '' , it makes sense you 'd do as little research on a topic as possible before talking about it . 
   some romanians go to church where they 're talked down to like drones . 
  i actually agree with that , i 'd much rather volunteer in a children 's hospital than go to church and pray everything gets better . 
   you see , a western european would know that . 
  lol honestly , i do n't know why i expected anything else but a childish answer . 
   romanian unions are a joke . 
  the unions have no influence whatsoever because regular union members have no influence on union leadership . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moving_the_goalposts  sport is an important part of german culture and society . 
  in 2006 about 27.5 million people were members of the more than 91,000 sport clubs in germany . 
  alright , i 'll concede this point too .
