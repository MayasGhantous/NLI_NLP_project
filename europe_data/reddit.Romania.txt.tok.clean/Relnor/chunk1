i just translated the article . 
  i did get the underlying assumption that us would be better than here , but did n't feel the need to change the meaning of what was said . 
  he ** has ** lived here for 35 years , i just made a mistake saying he 's 35 years old , which was incorrect . 
  he 's lived in both syria and a european country ( romania in this case ) and has a more balanced opinion than `` lets deport everyone and shut every border up tight '' or `` we must accept every person that even thinks about coming here '' . 
  most of this subreddit seems bent on extremes like that , so i thought maybe a more moderate opinion from someone who , unlike 90 % of us , has lived on both sides , would be interesting to see . 
  oops , yeah , was actually thinking it makes no sense , i just was n't paying attention . 
  some slight liberties were taken with the translation since the article had ( imo ) a few problems so far as making sense goes . 
  regardless , i think it would be interesting to see what a native thinks . 
  ~ ~ a 35 year old syrian ~ ~ a syrian that 's been living in romania for 35 years warns of the refugees that will be brought into the country : \u201e the authorities should pick them very carefully , verify them one by one -- they should not accept large numbers of strangers that can not be verified . '' abboud bachar is a doctor -- he studied here , married a romanian and has 5 children -- three of them are also doctors , like their parents . 
  they do have relatives in syria but none of them want to leave . 
  \u201e people that want to live in another country , should choose a legal path , such as a visa . 
  the problem is , right now , the syrians that want to go west legally , for example , to their relatives , are stopped , while those that run over the borders in waves are welcome with open arms '' , said doctor bachar . 
  \u201e very few of those that we see assaulting the borders of europe are truly poor people , that need help '' -- warns the doctor . 
  despite living in romania for 35 years , seeing his native country destroyed is painful . 
  \u201e the biggest problem that romania has right now is not the number of immigrants -- but the identity of the ones that will enter our country '' , says the doctor . 
  doctor aboud bachar studied in romania . 
  he took his wife to syria , then moved to romania for good , despite having the chance to live even in america . 
  mr.bachar mentions with saddness about the way europe 's leaders suddendly became interested in the syrian 's fate after images of aylan -- the three year old that drowned -- spread across the world , despite thousands of syrian children being killed in the last few years without much in the way of intervention . 
  in other news , russia has revealed today that the ~ ~ political prisoners ~ ~ proud workers sent to gulags were ~ ~ cynically murdered en masse ~ ~ really going on state-paid vacations and enjoyed ~ ~ daily beatings and starvation ~ ~ the picturesque siberian landscapes ~ ~ as they froze to death ~ ~ while singing patriotic songs next to warm fires . 
  russia also mentions that it is very cross with ~ ~ human rights activists ~ ~ western imperialists for trying to derail it 's ~ ~ murderous dictatorial regime ~ ~ attempts to bring marshmellows and paid-vacations to their neighbours in ukraine and the baltics as well . 
   i wonder how this tactic will pay off . 
  perhaps this sort of event will put others off from engaging in this line of business . 
  you think ? 
  i 'd say there are plenty willing to take his place . 
  as long as there 's a demand for people to leave , providers will pop up all over the place . 
  but it is n't european intellectual 's job to criticise islam . 
  what will that solve ? 
  how will that convince the fundamentalists to put down their arms ? 
  they see us as the bad guys , the crusaders , the devil , etc - why would they ever listen to what we have to say ? 
  criticism of fundamentalist islam has to come from within islam itself - clerics with authority within the religion have to take up a moderate stance and criticise these violent murderers . 
  we are not a believeable voice - islam does n't have a analogy to the pope , but if imams with a lot of weight , on both shia and sunni , speak out against violence - it will work , in time . 
  will it get rid of ** all ** the fundamentalists ? 
  no , the most hardcore will denounce the moderates as traitors etc , but the average guy that might be thinking about joining them will be strongly discouraged , if clerics that he respects speak out against terrorism . 
  ofcourse , right now the moderates are bowing their heads , meekly showing some dissaproval whenever some big attack happens , and otherwise saying nothing - which basically translates into tacit approval . 
  maybe , but not here in europe - there is n't really a ` solution ' to be had here . 
  these people 's homes have to be fixed , else they 'll keep coming this way . 
  and it has to be us , because the rich arab states will never lift a finger to help - they 're mired in this tribal/religious view of the situation and would rather see the area remain in chaos than the other islamic sect take over . 
  i think most of the refugees would want to return home if they are safe , but when has the middle east ever genuinely been at peace ? 
  at least they apologised , but why anyone would be offended by the guy 's uniform is beyond me . 
  what did another altercation have to do with this ? 
  was the other man involved in the altercation still there ? 
  if so , was it caused by the uniform itself ? 
  or something else ? 
  what would prompt the staff to ask him to move ? 
  i appreciate that the sgt. 
  did n't make a fuss though , he proved to be the better man - the lady that bothered him in the first place should be ashamed . 
  and that 's why some of us are calling out the right wingers , people can not end up seeking more radical options - can more radical options quickly solve the immediate problem ? 
  yeah , absolutely . 
  and then what ? 
  what do the radicals do after they solve the immigrant problem ? 
  do you think they 'll be like ancient rome 's dictators and hand power back to the senate ? 
  uhm , no . 
  they 'll turn the power they 've been imbued with against those that gave it to them . 
  it 's the same with actual terrorism - the us 's patriot act is a great example - passed quickly with everyone 's approval because of the emotion of 9/11 , later used against actual us citizens . 
  it 's a dangerous road to go down on . 
  that 's okay . 
  they can leave , i 'll come instead . 
  i 'm an atheist , have higher education , do n't mind the cold , prefer boredom over getting blown up/decapitated/set on fire by fundamentalist howler monkies and have already betrayed my romanian roots by never having stolen anything . 
  sounds good ? 
  good . 
  pretty much , lots of families ( including my own i believe ) got moved into these apartment blocks and when the communist government fell a bill was passed letting everyone keep the places they owned . 
  most of the people living on rent are students from outside whatever city they 're studying in , people generally still seem to prefer buying homes rather than renting . 
  it 's also why it 's not unusual to see young adults living with their parents up to ages that would be considered weird in other parts . 
  i 've heard from people in the west that it 's not that unusual to move out when you 're 18 , while here that 's rare - usually people move out when they form their own families . 
  interesting , did n't know that 52 % of germans rent their homes - by comparison , romanians live in homes they own themselves by an overwhelming 96,6 % . 
  wonder if there will be an update on this , would be curious to see if they actually evict her , and what the public reaction would be if it gets enough media attention . 
  perhaps all of us being thieves can help us come together ? ~, 
  hold it right there !, 
  we of romania claim first dibs on complaining about everything being shit - do n't you dare claim to be worse than us !, 
  same for romanian - it confuses a lot of people trying to learn english that are n't immersed in english-based media , internet , etc ofcourse , english is famous for it 's fucked up irregularities : http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html, 
  saudis fund other extremists in syria , i do n't think they 're on the best of terms with is , despite both sharing wahabbist roots . 
  i know the immigrant situation is the popular subject now , but these are the same guys who are anti homosexuals , anti reproductive rights and the same ones who 's propaganda posters feature maps of hungary with bits added on that were under the austro-hungarian empire . 
  i would 've said they were fascists 6 months ago too before any of this refugee clusterfuck was going on in europe . 
  her own quoute in the article : `` she said : `` i really believe that meat should be treated in exactly the same way as tobacco , with public campaigns to stop people eating it . '', 
  ofcourse , i do n't think anyone implied that she will stomp all over your neck with jackboots whenever you try to eat meat . 
  and anyone who did was being silly . 
  dunno about the others , but here in romania we then take all the meat on meat and meat side dish and wrap it all up in a few loaves of bread . 
  not a big fan of eating everything with bread , but it seems really popular . 
  ofcourse not , that 's boring . 
  a more cynical part of me would say that being a politician she did this for support/votes/etc - but since vegans are such a minority , it feels like a pretty stupid move . 
  so i can only assume she really believes what she says . 
  as on pretty much any other subject , some people ca n't help but fall into one extreme or the other - what the hell ever happened to having a balanced diet ? 
  oh i know , that 's hard , is n't it ? 
  requires some thought and care , much easier to ` champion ' one cause and declare yourself a `` militant '' supporter - as if been militant about anything is something to be proud of . 
  reminds me of the scandal here in romania in 2009 over the president hitting a boy - hordes of propagandists flocked to explain how the president 's arm could n't possibly move that fast , how there 's a blue pixel there and the video is obv fake . 
  she tripped him . 
  you just found a video where it is n't as clear . 
  she hit someone else too . 
  should this have been turned in as big of a deal as it was ? 
  it was a minor incident that did n't require the media attention it got - it was obviously trying to appeal to people 's emotions . 
  but she did do it - was it malicious ? 
  was she thinking about how much she hates them while doing it ? 
  probably not - we do n't know . 
  white-washing her however feels pretty desperate . 
  the fact that you speak so loosely about mass murder makes you every bit as disgusting as the worst of the worst within isis . 
  i 'd say something about western values and being better than the other guys , but if you 're serious then you 're obviously a ( n ) ( un ) diagnosed psychopath and it would be lost on you . 
  presidential candidate `` the donald '' seems to be having a lot of success with his anti-immigration campaign , a smaller more nihilistic part of me almost hopes he wins just so i could see how he fucks everything up in america and abroad . 
  was n't aware the refugees were all `` the people '' of the terrorist groups . 
  surely with this information in hand , the only solution is to kill all of them ? 
  romania volunteered to take in 1875 refugees and said we ca n't take more than that .
