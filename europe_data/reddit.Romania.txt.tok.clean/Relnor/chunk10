  she thought the me interventions were sanctioned by god too . 
  `` i care for the lives of the combatants killed in airstrikes but show blatant disregard for the life of this other combatant cause he 's russian '', 
  are you implying most muslims adhere literally to their scripture ? 
  they most certainly do not , just like christians do n't either . 
  i hope i need n't remind everyone that christian scripture is similarly harsh . 
  the point i 'm trying to arrive at is that lumping 1.5 billion people together as behaving in one way or another feels ( to me at least ) very wrong . 
  i 'm eastern european . 
  and although i ca n't really complain about discrimination , i 've seen plenty of stereotypical opinions about people from ee - are these grounded in ** some ** truth ? 
  usually , yes . 
  does it feel shitty to be painted with the same brush as certain segments of your society ? 
  totally . 
  which is why i always try to avoid doing it to others . 
  i always try to form an opinion on individuals rather than groups and even though i might fail sometimes , i try to stay aware of my prejudices . 
  the people responsible for last week 's attacks and those who support them need to be wiped off the face of the earth , but to think that someone who was born muslim and might not even be an ardent practicer getting mistreated for the actions of radicals is unconsciable and i am certain it has already happened . 
  anyway , i 've ranted enough for one day , my tldr point would be : it 's easy to blanket groups with hate , but treating all of them this way will only push more into the arms of radicalism . 
  maybe i have no idea what i 'm on about cause we do n't have a muslim minority and i do n't interact with any , but i like to think i 'd be reasonable . 
   it 's a totalitarian political ideology that seeks to enslave my entire gender . 
  same as the other abrahamic religions if you actually read what their holy texts say about women . 
  and yet , there are millions of muslim women outside of morally bankrupt regimes such as saudi arabia that are not enslaved . 
  in fact , here 's a fun game we can play : quran or bible ? 
  exhibit a : that they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children , to be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of god/allah be not blasphemed . 
  exhibit b : men are in charge of women , because god/allah hath made the one of them to excel the other , and because they spend of their property ( for the support of women ) . 
  so good women are the obedient , guarding in secret that which god/allah hath guarded . 
  as for those from whom ye fear rebellion , admonish them and banish them to beds apart , and scourge them . 
  america 's muslim population is way , way smaller . 
  taking mexican immigrants as an example , just like most muslims , most mexicans come to the us because they 're looking for a better life , not to cause trouble . 
  the main difference is between the negative elements of these groups : the `` bad '' mexicans are usually criminally motivated ( drug cartels , etc ) and as you would expect from criminal organizations , they would rather keep their activities as low profile as possible , because they 're in the business of making money . 
  the islamic terrorists on the other hand are ideologically and religiously motivated , which is why you 'll never see a mexican gang shoot up 100 civillians in a concert hall ( no $ $ $ to be gained ) but to the terrorists that is the whole point . 
  the eu also has open borders in the same way us states would between eachother but is not a single entity like the us - which is why even to this day 2 of the terrorists responsible for orchestrating the attack are at large . 
  thats all simple and good except real life is n't like that . 
  there are multiple denominations of islam , just as many of them as there are of christianity - you need to direct your attention towards the toxic wahhabism exported world wide by saudi arabia . 
  that is the ideology from which the vast majority of militant groups come from and as you know the saudis have some powerful friends that have cynically looked away for economic reasons . 
  guess what , i 'm an atheist , i do n't really like any of the religions . 
  if you really sit down and examine them they all have strongly patriarchal features that supress the rights of women and lets not even talk about anyone who 's lgbt - but : the moderates of all religions have changed with the times and while i might think the day when all these religions are relegated to the same status as greek mythology will be a good day , i shut up about it around religious people because i understand and respect the fact that the things they 're feeling are very real and very meaningful for them . 
  as long as they do not hurt others , it is not my place to shut down their churches , mosques , synagogues , altars , etc. 
  i love that reddit is supposedly this really liberal place which values human liberties and all those other good european values but banning religions gets upvoted by a ton of people . 
  what you suggested is about as un-european as you can get , maybe you 'd get along with the fundamentalists better than you think ? 
  based on my reading of the letter they were warned while they were on course to turkish airspace but still outside of it , and fired upon 17 seconds after entering it . 
  if you 're a 29 ~ yo resident who 's basically just starting out , you earn about 2250 ron which is about 500-ish euros . 
  meanwhile , in the real world outside of `` student actvism '' , well adjusted , civilized people follow tried and tested common sense methods such as not treating other people like shit or hurting others and civilisation has not collapsed yet . 
  we should strike at the french before russian mobilization is complete , we 'll go through the low countries and be in paris befo - oh , wait , nevermind . 
  isis are not talibans hiding in cave networks - they do have a place - it 's called al-raqqah . 
  that said , nuking that place would be unconscionable even if all the major powers would agree , there are thousands of civillians living there who could not leave even if they wanted to . 
  the damage to their leadership and infrastructure could be severe , but it would also be the biggest pr win they could ever hope for . 
  i never said the romani do n't have the same rights or are n't citizens , the guy asked what the difference is . 
  romanians are white eastern europeans of latin descent with slavic influences . 
  romani are also known as gypsies , they have their own language and culture but are better integrated ( in eastern europe anyway ) compared to certain minorities westerners are having trouble with / cough . 
  they originate from the indian subcontinent but have been in europe for well over 700 years . 
  romania in particular has a 3 % - ish roma/romani minority , the 2nd highest under hungarians with 6 % - ish . 
  `` i promise not to turn the republic into an empire '' , or how did that go ? 
  i love how the article talks about failing to integrate the roma and how bad we are , and yet i very clearly remember the sarkozy administration deporting thousands of roma a couple of years ago - i guess french society was n't better at integrating them ? 
  i guess if the roma had a religious ideology backing them up , it would n't have been so easy to deport them . 
  i propose this guy for pope : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdv1sbktxbi, 
  some elements of one minority group steal your wallet , other elements of another minority group steal your life . 
  the former is more negatively perceived ? 
  interesting . 
  regularly , probably not - in the aftermath of what happened not even a week ago , it probably would , yes . 
  til : people regularly carry assault rifles during their daily commute . 
  is n't this the same bloke that was sad with the french `` shoot to kill '' policy regarding the terrorists and said that uk joining france against them is a `` hypotetical question '' ? 
   it looks like radicals in the balkans are not nearly as capable and organized as their counterparts in france or uk . 
  we here in the balkans are known for being less capable at everything . 
  this time it worked in our favour . 
   they are vermin , and should be dealt with accordingly . 
  this kind of rhetoric sort of implies that what they did was outside of human nature , it 's not . 
  hate them all you want - i hate them too - i hate them for making me feel hate , but do n't dehumanise them , better to stare straight into the face of what people can be capable of than to relegate them to `` non-people '' and feel comfortable . 
  while this story turned out to be false , we usually consider people who put themselves at personal risk for no personal gain heroes . 
  a security guard at a concert hall in paris does n't typically have `` fight off assault rifle toting terrorists '' in the job description . 
  the hypotetical guard could 've run off and hid and no one would 've thought ill of it . 
  i 'm sure al-quaeda 's 2004 madrid attacks were also because of spain 's ** extensive ** involvement in the middle east ... 
  ottoderps are op . 
  the purple phoenix shall rise !, 
   when you look at the usa you see vibrant , multicultural  it 's a sad state of affairs for europe that there does n't seem to exist one nation which is tolerant and accepting of non-white people . 
  you do n't play with people 's lives just for the sake of being pedantic . 
  is 204 square km at threat ? 
  would you rather tell people to maybe stay at home tonight unless they have to ? 
  rather than seeing more potential victims , yes . 
  `` waah waaah different people now have the same rights as me waaah '', 
   completely different on almost everything . 
  sounds a bit far fetched . 
  all these countries you mention have very similar forms of governence . 
  romania 's for instance is even directly copied from the french model - eu countries have a fair few things in common and while its dumb to see them as homogeneous , it 's not really true that romania or even a language stand-out like hungary is as different from france as the us . 
  and the % of hiv positive homosexuals is much higher - this is n't about prejudice or hate , it 's a statistic . 
  gay men are a comparatively small percentage of the entire population - gay men that have n't had sex for 12 months are an even smaller percentage - it 's all pr for the sort who value their ` offence ' over other people 's medical well beign . 
  i do n't think shooting ceausescu was necessary . 
  besides , the mock trial and shooting was handled by what really were 2nd echelon communist party members who then went on to lead the country in the early 90s . 
  the most orthodox communists of 1989 became the most savage capitalists of 1990 . 
  fun fun . 
  with a 12 month abstinence period it basically sounds like a pr move . 
  the ban is n't there because `` we hates teh gays '' - it 's for good , medical reasons . 
  i 'm sorry if this upsets any tumblr people , but even 1 patient infected with an incurable disease because of notions of ` social justice ' is too many . 
  think of the big parties sort of like gangs . 
  they 've all been in power at one point or another , sometimes as parts of coalition governments , other times with a majority cobbled up with the help of one of the small parties . 
  there were two `` right wing '' parties , one of them - the liberal democrats , were ( unconstitutionally ) lead de-facto by the previous president . 
  for a few years in his second term he had a puppet prime minister in an almost putin-medvedev style affair . 
  these guys became very , very unpopular - the other ` right wing ' party along with the big ` left wing ' party formed a union and ousted their government in 2012 - since then , that union was dismantled and many of these very unpopular guys were merged into the clean/sparkly party that were the national liberals . 
  meanwhile the left party remained more or less alone in government , they lost the presidentials and are universally seen as corrupt - this is largely true , its a big , creaky party with many old faces that were part of the old communist state apparatus . 
  but that 's not to say the same is n't true of the other guys . 
  tldr : everyone sucks . 
  most protesters are asking for the removal of the ** entire ** current political class . 
  one of the most popular chants is `` psd - pnl - aceeasi mizerie '' - or `` psd - pnl - the same trash '',
