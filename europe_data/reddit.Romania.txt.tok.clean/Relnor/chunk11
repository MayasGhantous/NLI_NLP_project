  correct . 
  about political ideology though - you can put all of that to rest in romania . 
  political ideology is a joke here . 
  politicians routinely switch parties between `` left '' or `` right '' wing . 
  hell , the political union that lead the country after 2012 was the `` social liberal union '' - a mix of the biggest left wing party ( social democrats ) and one of the oldest right leaning parties ( national liberals ) - in truth they were far better than the previous government , but how is that for a political abomination ? 
  one of the smaller parties that had been propping up the current government , for instance , was a mix of exiles from other parties of all political colours - we even have a party that is basically based on ethnicity - the democratic magyar union of romania - they were in parliament for 20 + years . 
  the political crisis is n't getting comparatively little coverage cause it does n't ` fit a narative ' it 's because the whole thing is a quagmire of power struggles and greed over who gets to steal next and because romania is eastern european . 
  he will lose a lot of political capital/trust and possibly not win the next election , other than that , not much . 
  short answer : yes and no - eastern europe is n't as racially diverse as many western countries . 
  people are n't used to interacting with and seeing people of other races - seeing a black person for instance is a rarity for me , and i live in bucharest . 
  i 'd like to think i would interact with them the same as with everyone else , but simply the fact that they 're rare already makes them curious and probably at least subtly changes my behaviour subconciously . 
  it seems it was about 25.000 people by the way , not just 10.000 . 
  expect another one tomorrow , but i think even after just one protest of this size there is no way mayor piedone wo n't be evicted from office . 
  i think the prime minister will announce it before noon tomorrow . 
   i think you 're confused . 
  politicians dont sign authorizations . 
  the ** mayor ** might be a politician , but he has a position that is very much administrative , not just political . 
  he is responsible for this particular district of bucharest and his administration was responsible for giving that club authorization . 
   educating them in etiquette excellent . 
  it appears we agree . 
  i 'm just not quite sure how the education comes at the end of a baseball bat . 
  we do n't even play baseball here . 
  and thank god/allah/baby-jesus / sphagetti monster for that . 
   the local pop decided to solve it this way , there was no more trouble for 60 years yes . 
  and hundreds of years ago we had pogroms . 
  remember those ? 
  they were fun . 
  if we turn our nose up at these guys for being uncivilised , then it is ridiculously hypocritical to then proceed to beat them up with bats . 
  we need to prove we 're better - if these people are guilty - they need to be dealt with by the justice system . 
  lock them up , or deport them , all fair if they break the law . 
  is the system too soft on these people for political reasons ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  if it is , it needs to be fixed . 
  what wo n't fix it is this senseless violence . 
  radicalism breeds radicalism , i can run my mouth all i want - this will continue , exactly this kind of behaviour you seem to want . 
  so if this is what you want , do n't worry , we 'll see much , much more . 
  and what may have been moderates will feel more and more threatened and pressured . 
  with each attack like this , more supporters for terrorists are born . 
  are you serious ? 
  were these the rapists ? 
  or are you going to tell us that all refugees are rapists ? 
  are you going to go full-on donald trump ? 
  these were a bunch of ** thugs ** that beat up innocent people because of their misplaced ** hatred ** - it was n't heroic , it was n't just and it was n't brave . 
  it was cowardly , it was barbaric and it was most definitely un-european . 
  where are ** you ** from ? 
  tell me where you 're from and i 'll come up with some stereotype about your country and your population that makes it `` fair '' to get beaten up by a pack of savages . 
  sounds good ? 
  finally , even if these ** were ** exactly the rapists , we have a justice system here in europe - we have laws and ideals to uphold . 
  if you think brown-shirt style beatdowns belong in 2015 europe , then maybe you should n't be against these migrants , because this mob rule behaviour belongs to the middle east , ** not ** europe . 
  you sure ? 
  the first 44 photos are from yesterday 's march commemorating the victims . 
  after that it 's from other protests etc. 
  30 vs 3 huh ? 
  so not only are they violent thugs - they 're cowards as well ? 
  who ` da thunk it . 
  its unlikely anyone will be moved . 
  all they said is that contingencies are in place to move people if need be . 
  as it stands , the hospitals were overwhelmed , but by now they 've handled it . 
  you 're right about the earthquake though , if this is to be looked at as a stress test for a bigger event like that , then we 've clearly failed . 
  to you , this is some distant bullshit event that you can paste your political agenda over ; for some people in this sub , this might be about someone they know/knew - have a look below at the picture of the charred bodies . 
  might make things more real for you . 
  then again , i heard troll hearts are made of the same stone they build their bridges out of . 
  yup , it could 've happened anywhere , and we were `` lucky '' it happened in bucharest where there are a bunch more hospitals - and they were still overwhelmed . 
  can you imagine this same incident in a smaller city ? 
  it would definitely depend on how much your family would care to teach you about hungarian customs though . 
  i think in this case as far as nature vs nurture goes it 's very much nurture and very little nature . 
  i do think america is a special case though , it 's pretty impressive how all these different european cultures melted together into basically a new one . 
  a lot of people left europe with their italian , german , irish etc heritage - but then their children maybe married americans - by the time they had grandchildren what could 've been a full italian is now 1/4th italian , has never been to italy , and most people they know speak just english . 
  america is all they 've ever known , i would n't be surprised if they 'd identify as american . 
  ofcourse , it 's different in europe and especially in places the ussr messed with where populations were intentionally moved rather than the natural changes that happened in the us . 
  theres nothing ironical or cynical about the incident happening during a particular kind of party . 
  the same thing could 've happened in a crowded church while holding a sermon and it would n't - wait , no , that ** would ** have been ironic . 
  do n't you fucking put victims in quotation marks . 
  thats exactly what they are . 
  they 're victims . 
  do you think everyone 's thinking about safety at all times ? 
  how safe are you ? 
  how safe is the building you live in ? 
  what happens in case of an earthquake ? 
  shit - what if you walk outside tomorrow and a drunk idiot runs you over ? 
  just how far down the rabbit hole do you go . 
  i know it makes you feel better if you think you 're more clever and intelligent than everyone else , but guess what , if proper regulations would 've been followed , nothing would 've happened to those kids - and this has nothing to do with `` hand holding '' and everything to do with one 's responsibilities as the owner of an establishment . 
  if you walk into my store and shit falls off the shelves and hurts you - it is ** my ** fault , it 's not your fault cause you did n't think about it , or because you did n't consider the dangers of a fucking shelf . 
  i am the one that would be held responsible . 
  i wo n't even indulge the `` murderer '' part - you seem to know the words and if you know the words i assume you 're aquainted with how people behave in those situations . 
  and before you tell me you would n't , yes , yes you would . 
  you wanted to seem clever and edgy and make a statement about society , etc etc - heres what i think you should do : check the post right under this one with the picture from the club . 
  that is no longer abstract high level thinking . 
  thats real . 
  those are the `` degenerates '' you 're talking about . 
  have fun . 
  there is nothing wrong with halloween . 
  your agenda is transparent as hell . 
  also , it was ** not ** a halloween party , it was a rock concert , but i guess that 's bad too , since it 's not wholesome and conservative . 
  maybe you should blame the club owners and the ones responsible for safety instead of the victims ? 
  also , everyone here is or should be 18 + , so blaming their parents is even worse . 
  you 're not a `` degenerate '' if you want to have some laughs with your friends . 
  about 400 people apperantly . 
  26 dead and 140 something wounded so far . 
   one 's identity should n't be dependent on their surroundings .
