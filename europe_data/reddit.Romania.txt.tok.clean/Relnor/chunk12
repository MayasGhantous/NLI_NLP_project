  completely hypotetical , but if you would 've been raised by foster parents in the us who were n't able to teach you anything about your heritage , then you might be ethnically hungarian , but culturally you 'd be as american as one can be . 
  pnl internet propaganda too stronk . 
  i was all for pnl - a few years ago - now they merged with the worst of the worst . 
  the president won his election with the likes of blaga and ungureanu right there on the stage next to him . 
  it 's disgusting and it makes me sick that the oldest romanian party in existance has been hijacked by these parasites - then again , the public seems oblivious to it , so it 's pretty funny at the same time . 
  the protest was politically manipulated bullshit . 
  i wonder how many party members from the opposition were among the crowd organising everything . 
  the blame is soley on the people responsible for the huge fucking holes in the ground , not on the dignitary that was being escorted . 
  i would bet - anything - that if this happened to president iohannis 's motorcade it would n't have raised even half as much outrage , certainly nothing towards him . 
   a warning shot is use of deadly force . 
  is it ? 
  the warning was n't meant to kill , the bullet was n't meant to hit anyone - again , at least based on the info we got . 
  there 's a reason the word `` survivor '' is used for those who survived the now-ubiquitous us mass shootings , or the holocaust or other similar events - they were groups of people who , for one reason or another , were being exterminated . 
  that is n't what was going on here , unless they were being violent , the other refugees were not in danger . 
  maybe there 's a piece of this story that i do n't have , but based on what 's available now , it looks like an unintentional accident to me . 
  there 's free speech and then theres libel - if someone would be maliciously spreading rumours about you , possibly damaging your chances of getting new jobs , damaging your reputation , etc - would you not want to have a means of recourse ? 
  really ? 
  it 's simple , ** surviving ** implies that the group was subject to an attack - based on the info we have , this is simply not the case , the death of the migrant was an accident - the guard fired a warning shot and a ricochet killed one of them . 
  if this group of guys would 've been chased through the woods by guards with the intent of murdering them all , then yes - the remaining migrants could 've been called ** survivors ** - otherwise it 's a subtle push towards making the bulgarian guards look malicious , rather than the ** accident ** that it was . 
  i think the people who are glad that this guy was shot are - absolutely insane - and disgusting people that have nothing to do with western values , but it 's easy to see how the bbc is trying to put a certain spin on this incident . 
  anyone who tells you there is n't much in common between european countries just has some political agenda . 
  ofcourse there 's a lot in common - a big family though ? 
  not sure about that one , could argue either way . 
  perhaps you should brighten ** your ** image by learning some geography . 
  i 've seen this article before - it 's great . 
  i 've said time and time again that it 's moderate muslims that need to work to de-radicalize their own . 
  this guy could 've gone on to the middle east where he would 've lived a miserable and probably short life . 
  instead he 's a normal member of society , and this could only be acheived with the help of someone he could relate to . 
  shameful , i expect this stuff from florida or texas , not sweden . 
  i am distraught at these accusations !, 
  brave russian ~ ~ dictators and oligarchs ~ ~ worker-politicians have long standing tradition of ~ ~ rabidly bigoted and anti-democratic views ~ ~ fighting western imperialism and decadence !, 
  plans to segregate homosexuals are merely popular ~ ~ because we 're small minded and afraid ~ ~ because of caring and nurturing nature of population !, 
  with all the ~ ~ undesirables ~ ~ different citizens in one place - they can find happiness among their own kind !, 
  furthermore , equally dissapointing is the willful misunderstanding of `` liquidation '' - ~ ~ people actually concerned with human rights ~ ~ western dissidents would have you think that the word hides a nefarious purpose - in fact , nothing could be further from the truth !, 
  liquidation is merely ~ ~ a cowardly and cynical word for murder from people who presume to follow jesus ~ ~ a term we use to refer to a program to increase awareness on the importance of hydration among the populace - even when trying to ~ ~ kill people for the way they 're born ~ ~ improve our citizen 's lives , everyone sneers in contempt !, 
  remember komrades , pravda is the most reliable news source . 
  untill next time . 
  edit : downvoted by ~ ~ homophobes ~ ~ western shills !, 
  stay strong komrades , ~ ~ bigotry ~ ~ the truth will win out !, 
  did the people react like the story a month or so ago in france ? 
  was there screaming and panicking in the streets ? 
  oh , oh i got it - hey guys , at least , our hospitals suck so much , no immigrants will want to come here ~ !, 
  a silver lining for everything . 
  yes . 
  some romanians do like to whine a lot . 
  and other romanians are ashamed of the truth . 
  you say no one here cares about these posts . 
  well shit . 
  half of the posts on this subreddit are about local stuff in various countries that is interesting/weird/etc . 
  the other half is whatever the big story is ( russia/ukraine a few months ago , immigrants now ) . 
  with that logic no one cares about the former half at all , so lets not post anything ? 
  i suspect your tone would change if this would 've been a positive post about something beautiful rather than something ugly . 
  or would you also say `` why post this , no one gives a shit . '', 
  assad is a pawn . 
  the problem when you call russia `` evil '' or `` the bad guys '' is that it does n't leave much room for , well , anything . 
  what politcian will dare try to work towards some compromise when the other side is portrayed as satan incarnate ? 
  what is the alternative ? 
  again ? 
  the more you push to make the people on the other side look different , evil , inhuman , etc - the easier it will be for certain kinds of politcians - the kind who would just love some more regional conflicts to make mone money off of - to get into power . 
  i 'm not saying the west should sit around doing nothing , but this `` good vs bad '' rhetoric is just fodder for the masses . 
  and this is basically the dark side of the nanny state - this would never happen in romania : authorities here are pretty much on the exact opposite side , they 're criminally negligent . 
  obviously neither way is good - meh , i have no idea what being a parent is like , but i can imagine doing things that would probably end up with me in prison if they did this to me . 
  how is it not relevant ? 
  those magazines were banned to save a foreigner from feeling discomfort . 
  it 's not just relevant - it 's exactly the same . 
  i 'm too cynical to think this prince would 've been `` offended '' - he 'd be unlikely to care . 
  ofcourse , since the italian authorities stand to gain from him being happy ( investments ) they will bend over backwards to please him . 
  i was largely joking , and when i say this i do n't mean they 're all like that , but i 'll say it anyway : at least none of us ever thought to blow ourselves up in crowded areas or kill anyone in the name of a deity . 
  i really do hope there wo n't come a day when people will be nostalgic about having mostly eastern europe migrants because they `` only '' robbed them . 
  he 's not a good guy or a bad guy , he 's protecting russian interests . 
  the americans have been doing the same , i wish people would drop the good/evil dichotomy , it is n't really a thing in geopolitics . 
  russia is flexing it 's muscles at the us and showing them they have the same toys the us does . 
  at the same time they 're helping prop up assad 's regime . 
  whether it 's good or bad depends who you are - if you 're assad , it 's awesome . 
  nato wo n't like it because they want their own regime in syria , and that seems ever more unlikely now . 
  if you 're just some civillian in syria , you are now at even greater risk of being murdered than before , hurray !, 
  you get to take all the middle east migrants , and we all leave and stay in eastern europe , deal ? 
  deal . 
  you let them do their thing and show everyone what they believe . 
  good ideas win out over bad ones , given enough time . 
  here in romania , universities are totally different : i do n't know about all of them , but `` campuses '' are n't really a thing . 
  if you live in the city the uni is in , you just stay where you normally would - your parents/your own place if you have one/etc if you 're from outside the city , you live in a hostel , which i guess could be compared to a campus , but meh , not really . 
  economic inequality is n't as big a thing , we 're much more racially uniform , and student groups are n't really a thing either . 
  people just come to class , go home , rinse and repeat . 
  it 's really almost just like a more adult version of high school . 
  we do n't have any social justice stuff either - in my section ( english-japanese ) , we just follow simple social norms such as `` do n't be a dick '' and it seems to work out fine for everyone , i 'm always baffled at what i hear coming out of us and uk unis . 
  because we get bored and have too much time to think about stuff . 
  whenever i get any ideas , i just smack myself over the head and have another look at living conditions in other parts of the world . 
  that said , i do n't feel entirely comfortable with her getting in legal trouble over tweets , it 's slippery ground , free speech should be defended , even that of idiots . 
  iliescu is obviously a vampirical sith lord and will never die , so you 're out of luck there . 
  how much is that in real measurements ? 
  neither of them are incorret per say , but my example is a lot more unnatural than the one in the article , where ` woman ' is used as an adjective - it 's okay to do so , albeit less common . 
  interesting fact : in romanian , we have gendered nouns . 
  some occupations such as doctor or teacher have a female equivalent , created with a suffix . 
  however , using the female versions is totally ** incorrect ** , in proper/official speech , you always use the `` male '' version . 
  wonder what that means if i put the pc goggles on . 
  hello . 
  you seem like a nice male . 
  `` woman/women '' is a noun . 
  you would have to use it with , say , an occupation to turn it into an adjective - ie : a woman teacher a lot of the other people replying to you will get into gender politics bullshit , for what it 's worth ( read : not much o / ) i have a bachelor 's degree in english , i 'm not a native speaker though .
