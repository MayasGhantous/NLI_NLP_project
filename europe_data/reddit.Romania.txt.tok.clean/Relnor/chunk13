  as far as i 'm concerned , it 's a matter of nuance : male/female are basically medical terms . 
  no one ever says `` he 's a nice male '' - they say - `` he 's a nice guy '' . 
  generally , if you 're reffering to a specific person , i 'd stay away from male/female , since it just sounds wooden . 
  there 's a reason the ferengi on star trek keep calling their women `` feeeehmaaales '' . 
   there are strong differences in world view , beliefs , viewpoints , and their view of themselves in historical context , from the historical developments of each . 
  damm right there are - see what happens when these colonial types rebel from under the crown ? 
  long live king george iii !, 
  how the fuck do you equate homosexuals ( consenting relations between two adults ) to pedophilia and zoophilia ( adult imposing their will on a child or a creature that is n't self aware ) ? 
  just how do you do that ? 
  you ruled religion out , so i 'm only left to conclude that you get your news and education from pravda . 
  in which case , dasvidaniya - i 'm sure your komrades await you . 
  lucifer , obviously . 
  i see you have n't been doing your homework . 
  you tell them komrad !, 
  ~ ~ genocidal maniacs ~ ~ brave leaders in kremlin fight tooth and nail against ~ ~ democracy and self determination ~ ~ western imperialists only to be stabbed in the back by ~ ~ people they mass murdered in dark forests ~ ~ neighbours that were treated equitably for many , many decades !, 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  probably less close minded than the guy who does n't think other people deserve equal rights though . 
  i was just ridiculing you by the way . 
  i do n't care if you 're really religious or not . 
  people with shitty ideas do n't get argued with , they get ridiculed . 
  next you 'll probably go tell someone the refugees ca n't integrate ; then in the next breath you 're as bigoted as some of them are . 
  never change , 
  and jews killed jesus , so we better show them what for , ey ? 
  who 's in for a pogrom ? 
  and yet , all i 've seen are some skeptics , support in this post has been pretty much unanimous . 
  when you paint an image of `` the others '' in your head , it will become distorted as hell - which is what you 've done here . 
  he made a joke , no need to go straight for the genocide . 
  komrad , i find your comments about ~ ~ russian oligarchs ~ ~ brave worker-politicians highly disagreeable - the ~ ~ money grubbing ~ ~ esteemed leaders of ~ ~ soviet ~ ~ russian republics are merely worried about the shoddy work of ~ ~ polish people we would like to shoot in the back of the head in forests ~ ~ our otherwise good polish neighbours and the potential loss of life that might come as a result . 
  in order to ~ ~ reeducate ~ ~ show you the true face of our nation , we offer you an ~ ~ deportation ~ ~ all expenses paid vacation to ~ ~ a death camp in siberia ~ ~ the picturuesque siberian landscapes - your whole family is also invited !, 
  neither of these issues affect me in any way , but i have to call out nonsense - kim davis was trying to keep the status quo , to keep rights away from a minority in order to satisfy her own insecurities/delusions . 
  this priest is trying to change discriminatory rules , guess what , not all rules are good , that is why rules change . 
  before the courts in the us made gay marriage legal across the board - it was illegal in a lot of states . 
  i guess you would have said `` well dems the rules '' and that would 've been it , fortunately some of us want others to have the same rights even if we 're not part of that group ourselves . 
  but comrade !, 
  sovjet army 's ~ ~ ironically imperialistic invasions of sovereign countries ~ ~ friendly visit of good neighbour was merely attempt to ~ ~ cynically murder everyone and replace them with russians ~ ~ share culture with the rest of europa !, 
  < something something , refugees are getting crafty these days , something  in all seriousness though , awesome shot . 
  dammit , that was going to be my joke =(, 
  you know the new pope is doing at least some things right when conservatives hate him . 
  one situation comes from bigotry , the other situation comes from the way you 're born . 
  the woman is trying to live in the past , while the priest is trying to change old rules that should no longer apply in 2015 . 
  oh well ofcourse - putin loves his frozen conflicts . 
  georgia , transnistria and now ukraine , but perhaps we 'll see an end to people murdering eachother at least . 
   burn countries and kill millions the us has made some major blunders in the middle east , and have certainly cost a lot of people their lives - but , millions of deaths ? 
  unless you get your news from pravda , that is n't . . realistic, 
  are you implying that the norse scandinavian heathens do n't still sacrifice fair christians in the bl\u00f3t every october ? 
  the meaning - has - changed , the article says that experts are laying the blame ** partly ** at the feet of the us ( because of the us 's toxic relationship with sa ) - but obviously , the saudis were the ones that opposed it . 
  your title says that the us itself is completely at fault , which is n't true - it was n't intentional , but it did change the nuance . 
  smoking kills you and i would love nothing more than to see all these tabacco companies and the reprehensible marketing they 've used in the past - when they could - go bankrupt . 
  they sell death , if tabacco would kill you in days/weeks instead of years they would all be in prison , funny how things work , no ? 
  the law though ? 
  probably stupid . 
  is it really up to the government to enforce such specific things ? 
  i would rather see even harsher taxes - if people ca n't be educated out of their addiction , make it even more expensive . 
  a more nihilistic part of me would wish he would win just for the bottomless barrel of laughs that his administration would be - but if we 're to be realistic , it would be horrible if he would , and if he gets the nomination then the democrats basically win for free . 
  then trump wins and proceeds to call putin `` a baby , a loser '', 
  i do n't know if it 's the most ridiculous , but here 's a guy trying to sing romanian folk music in english : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drn4sf9gki4 i 'm sorry . 
  considering the majority of countries are accepting refugees , this seems like really bad business sense . 
  do we sieg heil before or after the execution ? 
  i 'm still new and trying to learn , sorry . 
   you only have one playstation 3 per person well shit . 
  if i were a murderer i 'd only settle for a pc in my prison . 
  the ottomans will be driven back !, 
  constantinopole shall rise again !, 
  tell me where you 're from and i 'll list off a bunch of inane stereotypes and generalizations about each and every person in your country . 
  i see 17 points on my post , it 's the guy i replied to that is hidden with -9 . 
  anyway , while there 's animosity here ( some warranted , a lot also not ) , my morbid curiosity has taken me to stormfront in the past and , i can assure you they 're much worse =p, 
   it is quran 's bidding to follow laws of non muslim countries . 
  funny that you would say that though , christians routinely pick and choose which parts of the bible they listen to and which they do not and i have this sneaking suspicion that muslims do exactly the same thing . 
  there 's a large % of hungarians living in about 3 of the counties in that area . 
  the vast majority of people on both sides get along just fine , but people still embroiled in tribalistic bullshit will argue over names . 
  as you 've already seen . 
  leaving serious things aside for a moment , i spent a few minutes thinking how exactly these people got the excrement that they threw at the soldier . 
  do they carry it around in bags for such occasions ? 
  did they create it on command ? 
  perhaps someone local can shed some light on the poogistics ( sorry , i 'll see myself out . . ) at play here . 
  while i think hillary would 've been better at least for europe , i 'm still laughing - the incredible hubris of the democratic party is what lead to this . 
  hillary is incredibly unpopular and i suspect if she was running against anyone else it would 've been even worse for her . 
  it was obvious the american people no longer want a career politician and the elites just covered their ears and did n't listen . . well , there you go then , you just put a crazy populist into office . 
  watching cnn on the tv , tyt and fox on stream , and refreshing the / r/the _ donald and / r/hillaryclinton megathreads . 
  so much fun . 
  you know , i 've been following the election , it was great fun . 
  personal preferences aside , i will be laughing all the way regardless of who wins . 
  the hardcore supporters of both candidates are * so * obsessed and hateful , you know the losing side will go into complete meltdown , it will be amazing to watch . 
  on the other hand , when hillary wins , you get to ( * eventually * ) hear trump 's concession speech , which would also be amazing . 
  honestly , i 'm not even sure which one would be more entertaining to watch . 
  i visited greece , italy , france , germany , austria and ` passed through ' bulgaria and hungary . 
  that said , you have plenty of time for the rest , considering brexit wo n't happen for years , if * ever * . 
   also taking part of fucking satanic rituals . 
  alex jones is great , is n't he ? 
  just silly . 
  they 're afraid their child would be ** indoctrinated ** by . . what . . a short visit to a mosque ? 
  is their kid that mentally feeble ? 
  have they not educated him/her properly ? 
  these are the same people who come up with brilliant arguments such as `` what will i tell my child if they see two men kissing ?! '', 
  i do n't know . . it 's your shitty kid . . deal with it ? 
  the way they worded the title is just silly . . it makes it sound as if the albanian pm actually threatened greece . 
  have you really never seen anyone ( even people in positions with a worrying amount of power . . ) butcher their native language in a wide variety of ways ? 
  it 's really common here . 
  assuming there is n't a logic behind what the kremlin does is about as dangerous as pretending they 're totally innocent and have only the best of intentions . 
  everything governments do is based on what they ( or certain people within them ) can gain .
