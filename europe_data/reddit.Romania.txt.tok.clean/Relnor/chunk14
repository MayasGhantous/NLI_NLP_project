  or do you actually believe crimea was invaded out of nationalist fervour ( lol ) and the government persecutes gays because the oligarchs are really pious ( extra lols ) ? 
   second , my view is that welfare should be disconnected from industry . 
  if you 're poorly-paid , and the state wants to produce a more-egalitarian spread of income , any subsidies it provides you should be disconnected from your particular industry , since the real thing that matters is income . 
  it should n't be because you industry happens to be politically-connected . 
  but then how are you going to get those sweet sweet votes from them voter blocks ? 
  away !, 
  away with your reason !, 
  my re-election campaign is more important !, 
  considering the stability of the region , iraq could 've become a water slide park by the time news gets back to reporters . 
  i too can meme : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot, 
  you 're right . 
  lots of ** bad hombres ** out there . 
  so the 15 and 17 yos should 've been put in prison for underage sex . 
  got it . 
  that 's clearly the right direction . 
  how about an ideology in which we do n't hate people for the way they were born ? 
  dangerous idea , i know . 
  good thing macedonia is n't a member of the eu then . 
  i do n't know if he 's trying to justify it , but he 's totally right , that * is * how people think , regardless of you agreeing with it or not . 
  there 's a difference between observing a phenomenon and agreeing with it . 
  it would be hard to argue with the point that foreigners doing something bad gets more coverage . . 
  notice how even the weather improved ever since the commies were driven out . 
  not really , since apart from some vegans being kind of annoyingly preachy , they do n't try to infringe on the rights of anyone else . 
  now if there would be a terror group of vegans who proclaim to speak for all vegans and who throw meat eaters off of high buildings , i might understand why you 'd show apprehension when someone claims to be one , although i 'd still say that just like most muslims are normal humans who just want to live like everyone else , so would most vegans not want to commit genocide against meat eaters . 
  so i take it if two people lived together for , lets say , 30 years , and one of them dies , you find it completely ok for the family of the deceased to be able to inherit everything with no consideration given to their partner ? 
  if their so has a medical emergency and certain decisions have to be made on their behalf , is someone who they 've lived with for 30 years not considered and its passed to `` next of kin '' instead ? 
  what about the tax benefits ? 
  should gay people be exempt from these because we do n't like them ? 
  what else should they be exempt from ? 
  maybe we should keep them away from certain jobs ? 
  certainly from anything with kids , else they might infect them with `` teh gay '' , right ? 
  why not go to the logical conclusion and segregate them ? 
  maybe we can look for a cure . . 
  same sex marriage is `` progress '' in the same sense that women 's suffrage was progress . 
  the world was working perfectly fine before it too , and i 'm sure many guys like you back then were like `` wiiiimenz votz ?!, 
  lel '' , but it was progress in the sense that we stopped treating certain people as 2nd class citizens . 
  i find it supremely hilarious that when someone applies the same sort of generalization to your country you recoil in horror and explain that it 's a minority , while 3 posts up you were doing the exact same thing ... 
  you should n't dismiss the koran so quickly , they share your homophobic attitudes . 
  perhaps reconsider your stance on them and start growing that beard ? 
  yes please . 
  in your little boxes , all of you . 
  do n't even try to understand `` the others '' , they 're scary , weird and different . 
  keep exclusively to your own and boo and hiss at anyone else . 
  big brother likes it this way . 
  i do n't even have a drivers license , but is n't it common practice to look in your rear view mirror before opening your door ? 
  makes more sense than having to open the door with your right hand . . 
  you 're right . 
  for the longest time it was also not considered a big deal to just kill someone who disagreed with you . 
  who would * you * fight for in syria ? 
  there are a lot of brilliant factions to choose from !, 
  you can fight with the guys who chop off heads and drown people in cages . 
  you can fight for the dubious mustachioed man in damascus who gasses children . 
  you can fight for the so called moderate rebels , but you might as well jump off a cliff cos they 're on their way out anyway , and ` moderate ' does n't quite hold the same meaning we usually assign it . 
  oh , and did i mention that depending on which side you choose , nato or russian bombers could kill you essentially at any time ? 
  fun for all !, 
  so , you can fight for your `` country '' - is it your country though ? 
  why , that depends on your ethnicity and your religion - and in some cases on the specific denomination of that religion . 
  you might not feel that this place you were born in is `` your country '' at all . 
  but let 's assume you feel at home , you 've made your peace with being at constant risk of being blown to a million bits , and you 've found your favoured group of ideologically charged murderers ... 
  wait . . what 's that ? 
  nothing you will be sweating and spilling your blood for will ever be achieved cos syria is a playground for world powers that do n't care about you or your plights ? 
  well ... well shit then . 
  i do n't know if you 're an idiot like the other guy called you , but you took a very complex situation and ignored all of it just to take a potshot at someone who genuinely seems like the sort of immigrant we * do * want . 
  not clever . 
  of course they 're reactionary , that does n't make them any less stupid . 
  and there 's no good reason to put sensitive in quotation marks , it 's the truth . 
  thin skinned , hyper sensitive , `` you 're with me or against me '' bullshit , from every side . 
  these guys will be `` triggered '' just as badly when you mention that maybe not all < insert minority  are out to get you as the far left crazies do over `` cultural appropriation '' by wearing a certain kind of hat or whatever . 
  this behaviour is more dangerous than you may think . 
  people putting their blinders on to anything other than their own way of thinking is just one more step towards a totalitarian regime . 
  just look at the state of us society and tell me that it would n't be really easy for a strongman ( trump is too stupid and self absorbed ) to take advantage of this sort of sentiment and whip up one side against the other for whatever nefarious purpose . 
  and it 's not only a us problem , it 's happening here too . 
  this unwillingness to listen , this entrenchment along ideological lines , the bullheaded stubbornness , the hatred towards anyone that shows even a hint of a different opinion - at the risk of sounding dramatic , this eats away at our societies more than any terrorist element could ever hope to . 
  i do n't know what the exact fix is , but `` they started it ! '', 
  is n't it . 
  understanding will have to come from both sides . 
  difficult to answer . 
  probably needs to start early in education . 
  perhaps a debate class of some sort , mandatory ? 
  where people learn how and why you need to respect other people 's ideas and what you can learn from them even if you do n't agree . 
  the internet , ironically , made things worse . 
  instead of meeting a more diverse group of people and having your world view challenged by them , it 's now even easier than in real life to segregate yourself from the rest and only ever read what other people who think the same things you do say . 
  this ca n't really be helped though , only by instilling people with a healthy dose of skepticism , curiosity , open mindedness and a little bit of empathy can you break this cycle , but how exactly you 'd do that ... probably someone more clever than me needs to say . 
  have said it before and everyone hated it , so i 'll say it again : everyone is super sensitive nowadays . 
  and no , i 'm not talking just about the so called `` far left '' , i mean ** everyone ** . 
  whether they 're `` alt right '' or `` far left '' or whatever , everyone is super sensitive about their beliefs and ** hates ** the other side so much , that they do n't even give a moment 's thought to the other side 's ideas . 
  the alt right loves to mock the idea of `` safe spaces '' , but my god do they love their own echo chambers too . 
  * so * much hypocrisy . 
  take brexit for instance . 
  regardless of how you voted , there will be large groups of people on the other side who will * hate * you . 
  does it matter why you personally voted and what your beliefs are ? 
  they already have preconceived notions about all of it . 
  so if you voted to leave , you must be a racist , xenophobic bastard who probably loves trump too . 
  if you voted to stay , you must be part of the `` pc world gone wrong omg '' who `` hates his culture '' and `` identifies as an attack helicopter '' . 
  heavens forbid any of these people would spend even a moment thinking more deeply about ** why ** other people hold different beliefs and care even a little about supposedly core tenants of our democracies such as free exchange of ideas . 
  nope , it 's just `` you 're either with me or against me ! '', 
  as if totalitarian systems of government do n't pander to the lowest denominator . 
  both fascism and communism did their thing by whipping up the uneducated masses into a frenzy over whatever ideology they had . 
  not to mention that in totalitarian system people who have no business being in positions of power can end up there simply because of their connections or because they 're brutish thugs . 
  see goering , stalin , etc.
