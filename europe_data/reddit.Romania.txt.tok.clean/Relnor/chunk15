  those guys would n't have been allowed to run a lemonade stand in a real democracy . 
  the difference with democracy is that it recognizes the individual 's lust for power and for that reason power is separated in the state ( * in theory * , anyway ) . 
  so yes , bad politicians in democracies will pander and lie their way into offices , but after x number of years they 'll be gone . 
  bad politicians in authoritarian systems will pander and lie their way into office ... and stay there . 
   as far as we are aware , no authority in hungary has banned the possession of political dissent . 
  and that 's good , i hope it stays this way . 
  op in particular was clearly happy with silencing opposition though , which is not cool . 
  both sides do it , there is a lot of hypocrisy ~, 
  what does this have to do with you being `` glad '' it was closed ? 
  you should n't be ` glad ' opposing viewpoints are silenced , regardless of circumstance . 
  viewpoints you do n't agree with are not necessarily 100 % wrong and most people who have them are n't whatever boogyman embodiment you and others with your viewpoints have built up in your heads . 
  this is true for every `` side '' . 
  that 's a moot point . 
  if you 're in favour of democracy you wo n't be `` satisfied '' when opposing view points are silenced , regardless of the circumstances of their silencing . 
  he is n't in favour of democracy , he just wants his viewpoint to be the only viewpoint . 
   i said i was personally glad this newspaper closed since i have a different , opposing view concerning politics . 
  that makes me a fascist now ? 
  this is a joke question , right ? 
  remember that whole bullshit about democracy and exchange of ideas ? 
  you know , defending the right of someone to speak their mind even if you disagree with them ? 
  if you 're advocating for closing a newspaper because it has different political views to you , then you 're by definition a fascist , there really is n't anything to argue about here . 
  people deeply entrenched in their political ideologies will always wave off anything that damages their position and confirmation bias the hell out of anything that reinforces it , it makes no difference where on the spectrum they are . 
  hey op - do n't worry about stupid people vilifying you . 
  even when it comes to brexit , people need to remember the vote was almost 50-50 , so when you 're looking down on brits as xenophobic or whatever , remember that almost half of them did n't want to leave the eu , and even some of those that did vote to leave did n't do so for xenophobic reasons . 
  that said , there ** is ** , as i 'm sure you know , a portion of british people that have always looked down on the rest of europe . 
  i do n't know how many times i 've heard british people say that they 're `` not part of europe '' or refer to everyone else as `` continentals '' . 
  but those are just the stupid people on your side , and not representative of the majority . 
  finally , some stereotypes are just for fun . 
  if i say the british are stealing all the romanian dentists to care for their horse teeth , i 'm not actually being serious . 
  only parents or can we go for all the other relatives as well ? 
  if so , how many times removed ? 
  2nd cousins for sure , 3rd too maybe ? 
  do we put them in normal prisons or make special camps ? 
  i hear * madagascar * would be nice , but if you have a more definitive * solution * , do let us know . 
  of course .

  once again with the quotation marks - in supposedly serious publications , quotation marks are not used for irony like they are on the internet . 
  they 're used , unsurprisingly , for quotes . 
  if you read the article , you 'd see this quote : * `` we have reason to believe that the incident was a terrorist attack , '' a spokesman for the belgian federal prosecutor 's office , eric van der sypt , said . 
  * so all the bbc 's title did was quote the prosecutor . 
  this is like the molestation case from last week where the title said something like `` hotel worker awarded 70,000 in `` molestation '' case '' - it did n't mean they were like `` lol yeah right molested huh '' - it was what the authorities called it . 
  maybe they 're wrong , maybe this is n't a terror attack , but i do n't think the bbc did anything wrong with their title here . 
  there 's plenty to complain about how mainstream media handles the news , this is ok tho . 
   mentioning hitler kinda gives reference to ww2 . 
  or i might not understand you clearly enough . 
  could you try to explain what you meant with the : he probably means that it 's a tank bed in the shape of one of the wehrmacht 's tanks . 
  like a pz ii or iii . 
  they 're using quotation marks for molested to quote the official charge , not to put in question whether it was actually an assault or not . 
  why would you be surprised ? 
  people with power transcend the rules that are forced on the majority . 
  if you 're an every day woman in islam , all the rules and restrictions apply to you . 
  if you 're a saudi princess , you can do more or less whatever you want . 
  what you do n't actually think most of the elites believe the religious shlock do you ? 
  that 's for the little people . 
  see , they 're not fundamentalist after all , just greedy , exploitative dicks . 
  as if trump would n't have to tow the line too . 
  the us president is n't all powerful , there are far too many interest groups and powerful people that want to maintain the status quo with saudi arabia . 
  change that , then we can talk about which potus would push for a change in foreign policy towards saudis . 
  this is not the way abuse from a supposed loved one works . 
  you 're probably thinking that a man is physically stronger and a woman could n't stand up to him in a physical confrontation , that 's usually true , but even when it is n't , this sort of abuse is usually mixed with emotional abuse as well . 
  you could say `` no prob bruh i 'd defend myself smack her right back hah ! '', 
  and that 's all well and good but now imagine not some girlfriend you 've had for 3 months but someone you care really deeply for who is just losing it , either from alcoholism or mental illness or whatever , and assaulting you . 
  yeah , it 's not the same . 
  that 's great and all , but you could go to any metropolis and show it in a flattering or unflattering light . 
  as someone else mentioned ny you could go to all the landmarks and it will look amazing or you could go take pictures of all the homeless people and the run-down , abandoned buildings they squat in . 
  do n't get me wrong , there 's a lot of legit things to complain about in romania but i also see certain romanians be so jaded and cynical ( not that i 'm not sometimes ) about everything and never miss an opportunity to say how shit everything is . 
  you 're partially right , but it 's not ** that ** bad either . 
  under the sea the mermen feast on starfish soup , and all the serving men are crabs . 
  well that 's no fair . 
  boris is a funny doofus that we all giggle about and will never really do anything while trump is a narcissistic simpleton who might bumble his way into leadership of the most powerful nation on earth . 
  hate it . 
  i was awake , it was basically nothing . 
  i felt it , but did n't even care enough to get off my chair . 
  the media is in a frenzy over it , right now i see `` breaking news : new 3.1 earthquake in less than 12 hours ! '', 
  ... seriously ? 
  why is that worth reporting ? 
  of course , everyone here is deathly afraid of earthquakes and the way they 're reported on is a large part of it . 
  one guy apparently panicked and jumped through his window , good thing he was on the 1st floor . . no deaths , no injured , not even any damages , and this non-event will be discussed in dozens of talk shows , and that will be about it . 
  cos all we do is talk about it , then everyone goes back into their rickety buildings and keep meeting up every night in those death trap clubs in buildings from 1900 . 
  within his legal power , yes . 
  politically ? 
  i 'm not so sure even trump would be able to do whatever he wants without repercussions for his administration . 
  if he * can * , then perhaps that 's a serious flaw in the us democracy ? 
  even assuming he would , does trump actually have the power to do whatever the hell he wants ? 
  i would assume there are powerful people with strong interests in maintaining the status quo that would do their utmost to influence the trump administration away from any course of action they disagree with . 
  austrian teen learns about streisand effect . 
  while i 've never smoked ( except passively . . ugh ) and would totally be in favour of this , it 's not going to happen . 
  prohibition does n't really work , just ask america . 
  there just needs to be better education so as small a % as possible get into it . 
  `` you 'll die , you idiot ! '', 
  does n't really work since dying of lung cancer from smoking is a long term deal , and humans do n't do well with long term . 
  try to `` save '' as many as possible , you wo n't be able to help them all . 
  the president does n't have executive power in the romanian republic , at least not in theory . 
  there 's this impression people are dissapointed with him because this election was one that galvanized the youth and they rallied around him , and of course since it was their first rodeo they expected everything to suddenly change to milk and honey . 
  as it stands , other than talking as if he 's an automaton operated by an alien invader , he has n't done anything particularly egregious . 
  where are we sending them away ? 
   is there any benefit for serbia from gaining kosovo ? 
  maybe someone from serbia can tell us , but my guess would be : none whatsoever . 
  does this area have any strategic or economic value to the serbian state , or is it all rah-rah nationalism ? 
  makes sense .
