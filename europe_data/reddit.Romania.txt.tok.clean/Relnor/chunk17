  oh wait . . what 's that ? 
  i should n't listen to what a minority of crazy people say or think and assume their view is a consensus ? 
  meh , that 's no fun . 
  pray tell how many generations does someone 's family need to live in europe to live up to these standards ? 
  i can complain about the us a lot , but here is something the us gets right - you were born in the us and lived in the us all your life , brought up with us values , you 're american - not english , german , dutch , japanese , nigerian , or wherever else your ancestors could come from . 
  you can criticize people for not integrating but i 'm going to stop you and call bullshit when you say that someone who otherwise behaves and believes the same things you do is too brown for you to call them european . 
   an apology from uk for selling eastern europe to russia after ww2 . 
  to be fair , i do n't think russia would 've let the countries that would become the warsaw pact go over to the allies peacefully . 
  the last thing we would 've needed was a continuation of the war , especially if it would also involve us nuclear weapons which i 'm sure they would 've been happy to use since there was no soviet bomb at the time to deter them . 
  millions would die and i do n't even want to think about what would 've happened when the soviets eventually got their own bomb . 
  the real historical outcome was for the best , and i say that knowing full well how much 50 years of communism fucked this country up . 
  [ he 's way late to the party .

  they do n't attack people themselves because for all their bluster , they do feel like they have things to lose . 
  terrorists usually feel they do n't have anything to lose , i do n't think you 'll find a lot of terrorists who 's profiles read something like `` they had a great relationship with their family , a loving spouse , 3 beautiful children and a job they really enjoyed '' - usually it 's people who have nothing going for them except their belief in the ideology . 
  yes , some of them might be `` well educated '' , but that 's not the whole story . 
  as for inciting . 
  if some mentally ill person would run out and stab a gay person then say he was inspired by wbc sermons , would wbc have any blame for providing inspiration , or was the guy just unstable and would 've done it anyway ? 
  the moment this thing genuinely affects the bottom line of people with real power , the situation will be quickly and efficiently dealt with , i 'd almost guarantee it . 
  as it stands , it mostly affects average people , and who cares about those ? 
  i doubt it . 
  why would anyone be trying to fly their drone around at 4:30 am ? 
  went through only 1 page of your comment history . 
  * you * are disgusting . 
  hope you 're a troll . 
  just terrible , hopefully the local authorities were well organized enough to provide the survivors with shelter and medical attention . 
  take note though - this is how the bucharest old town will inevitably look like after we have our own earthquake , if not worse . 
  hundreds of old , historical buildings that have n't been consolidated will come crashing down , mostly on the heads of youth , since they 've been turned into bars and clubs . 
  i would say i hope this tragedy makes us wake up , but i 'm a bit past that by now . 
   can they also get rid of massive crosses worn as lockets ? 
  well that 's clearly not possible . 
  you think terrorists are bad , just wait untill you have to [ deal with this guy .

  this shitty attitude is the same nonsense as when people get called `` defenders of islam '' when they talk about the bullshit other religions do . 
  you can talk about a certain group 's problems without automatically neglecting everyone else . 
  your problem is that you hear about `` women 's problems '' and all you can think of is what you can read on / r/tumblrinaction . 
  now i love tia , its funny , the people shown there are clearly insane , but you have to realize they 're an extreme minority , just like the people showcased on / r/thebluepill are also an extreme minority , albeit less of the funny and more of the depressing sort . 
  try not paying attention to the extremists sometimes and understanding why certain people might believe or care about certain things , you 'll find most of them are n't insane , but the internet ** does ** give the insane ones a megaphone . 
  you know your democracy is fucked when the only words people on different sides of the political spectrum have to say to each other is `` retard '' or `` salty '' . 
  do n't you guys dare to think about why there are millions of people adhering to both kinds of ideology , the < insert one you do n't feel you `` belong '' to  must be all retards . 
  the elites love it when you keep your horse blinders on . 
  they do n't give a shit about this `` lel left wing right wing '' bullshit you guys fight over . 
  being a billionaire transcends political ideology . 
  they moved romania to the north caucasus and forgot that the actual countries there exist . 
  in the same sense that there are romanian police officers in italy or other countries with a large romanian minority . 
  they cooperate with the local police to catch romanian criminals or , in the chinese case , to put a familiar face for their clueless , non-english speaking tourists . 
  if i nail a lobster to my door will that deter the evangelists ? 
  i 'm pretty sure if , say , a guy in a truck would run over 100 people in vladivostok , it would get on the frontpage here . 
  why ? 
  because it 's an event that might affect russia 's foreign policy , and russia 's foreign policy affects europe . 
  this is n't any different , turkey has been a part of european politics and culture ever since the ottoman empire . 
  hell , a lot of countries in south-eastern europe were under the ottoman empire for a long time . 
  and turkey 's foreign policy continues to affect us today , so when things like this happen , they are relevant to us as well . 
  my guess is , op has a problem with turkey and likes to pretend what happens over there does n't matter , but he also seems to be american , so whatever . 
  if i were to guess , i 'd say that the last line annoyed some people as it came off pretty arrogant/smarmy . 
  if i were to be meaner , i 'd say people do n't like having their world view rattled in any way and being told that not all 1.6 billion adherents to a particular code/set of rules interpret it the same way is `` triggering '' them . 
   regions in romania that have a distinct identity that is not related to any major regional country or gypsies . 
  most regions do not have their identity related to gypsies since gypsies are like 3.3 % of the population . 
  it 's about as silly as saying most regions in germany have an identity related to turks , since there 's pretty much as many if not more turks in germany than gypsies in romania . 
  and yes , you can easily trigger a lot of romanians saying something like that =p, 
  there is free healthcare and education , but i would n't bet my life on either of those two . 
  for healthcare , if you 're in a big city , you 'll get care , and if you 're lucky , it wo n't kill you . 
  if you 're in some village somewhere , well , just do n't get sick okay ? 
  no shanty towns , but some beaches are ridiculously overpriced ( as in , ibiza style prices ) while not offering anywhere near the level of service you 'd expect for the price . 
  if i were you , i 'd go to greece if you 're after beaches . 
  if you want to visit anything in romania 's coastal area , you 're better off visiting the danube delta , at least that is unique . 
  cultures are not equal . 
  if your culture drives you to mutilate little girls or kill people because of who they love , it deserves to go to the trash bin along with all the other shitty ideas we 've had , like witch trials and eugenics and yes , imperialism , which you seem to have no problem condemning . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm just really bigoted against those who intentionally harms others because of how they were born , whether it 's race , gender , sexuality , or whatever . 
  i ca n't help it , i 'm just ** that ** intolerant . 
  i mean , i aim to be god-emperor of europe by 2030 . 
  we all have dreams . 
  politics do n't work the same way as your schoolyard , honey . 
  as unjust as what happened is , you are amazingly delusional if you think politics between countries works the same way arguments between individuals do . . 
  they probably had a lot of practice from all those big choreographed displays that communist regimes liked to do all the time . 
  see !, 
  they were good for something after all !, 
  well , i 'm sure the mayors of all these towns have their seats firmly secured for the next election cycle after this fantastic defence of french values . 
  * so triggered . 
   russians are mongols/bit slavs and belarussians are slavs . 
  mongols and russians look very different , unless you 're talking about citizens of the russian federation that live in the far east . 
  in fact , what you said is so ridiculous that i can only assume you consider being `` mongol '' an insult , so ... racist much ? 
  ps : and no , mongols pillaging what would later be russia for a very long time does not make russians mostly mongol and a bit slav as you try to imply . 
  even the most casual observer can tell they do n't share the same characteristics , christ . 
  damm straight . 
  everyone knows * the lord * ( take your pick whichever one you prefer ) made everything as-is 5000 years ago . 
  you 're not being as clever as you think you are . 
  there have been `` rules '' for war for much longer than any of the `` oh no pc culture gone wrong '' that you probably think this is derived from . 
  people die in war , especially combatants . 
  that is how war works . 
  that does n't mean there should n't be rules against being needlessly cruel . 
  those savage things you describe are as a result of dehumanizing the enemy , which is a great strategy if you 're one of the elite sitting in your ivory tower but not so great if you 're a human being . 
  might be channeling godwin here , but you need only compare the wehrmacht 's occupation of france to what they did in poland and the ussr . 
  the treatment of the occupied areas and even of the pows was very different , as i 'm sure you know . 
  so no , `` this is war '' ! = `` everything is permitted , go crazy '' . 
  you can fuck off . 
  what government mistreatment of roma gypsies ? 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  where do you get your information ? 
  i can safely say our minorities are better treated than almost anywhere else in europe .
