  did you know we had a party based on ethnicity ( magyars ) in parliament for over 20 years in a row ? 
  do you know there are clans of these * terribly mistreated * gypsies that build literal palaces for themselves and are in many cases basically above the law ? 
  i could go on , but you 're obviously projecting the treatment of minorities in your society to ours . 
  also , your guy is n't a journalist , at least he certainly was n't a fucking journalist here , it was a hack job and it was obvious from the moment the video was put out . 
  if you truly care about journalism , you would admit this . 
  2 reasons : 1 . 
  nationalism derp . 
  nothing else to say here , you know the shtick . 
  just people generally being dicks and using differences between eachother to justify their behaviour . 
  i always try to avoid doing this , but you know how when you see someone you do n't like , especially a stranger , you might start looking for things that are `` wrong '' with them or that you perceive as negative ? 
  if they 're the same ethnicity/race/etc as you , you 'll look for something else - are they fat ? 
  do they look funny ? 
  do they talk weird ? 
  are they poorer ? 
  richer ? 
  anything different . 
  if they 're from a different country/race/etc , well then that makes it easy , especially if there are historical differences involved . 
   and what \u00b4 s the point of man going to the beach without watching almost naked beautiful women ? 
  i mean , surely that 's a perk of going to the beach , but if without it there is `` no point '' then i would have to question how healthy your decision making is . 
  `` local imam killed by state for preaching the quran '' i 'm sure the locals will ** really ** love you now . 
  yup , killing people has been an amazing solution to everything . 
  heavens forbid we would n't opt for the lizard brain option every time and instead think of how we could replace him with a more moderate speaker that has a different narrative for these youths . 
  ah , but no , that 's complicated !, 
  thinking hurts !, 
  how about we just go the extra mile and kill ** all of them ** ? 
  i mean , if they 're all dead , the only people left will be other wholesome people like ourselves and everything will be awesome , right ? 
   one guy in cardiff says something way to understate things . 
  the difference between `` one guy '' , as in some random guy as you clearly imply , and an imam , a respected community figure , is huge . 
  young people look up to this guy , they take his words as gospel and his words are poison . 
  so no , it is n't `` just some guy man you guys are racists '' , it 's a bigot who is filling the minds of yet another generation with more bigotry , right in the middle of a european country . 
  so yes , i think it 's newsworthy . 
  i know . 
  and did you notice how quick and sprightly everyone moved back then ? 
  we 've grown slow and sluggish now by comparison . 
  it 's very telling of how he feels about romania , he thinks he 's untouchable and can say/do whatever he wants cos `` romania lol '' hopefully he 'll get a lesson in humility . 
  at least i do n't have to fear for my life around law enforcement . 
  who ** would ** say it though ? 
  `` hey guys , remember that big thing you all voted in and it was controversial but one side won and we may not be legally obliged to follow through but are morally ? 
  uh , yeah , fuck that , woo ! '', 
  regardless if you voted remain or leave , i 'd think in a serious democracy that politician would be killing their career by doing that . 
  even the people who voted remain would denounce them , or at least they * should * , if the democratic process means anything . 
  what 's your prefered method ? 
  hanging ? 
  shot in the back of the head ? 
  hmm , maybe something more traditional , a good ol public beheading ? 
  none of that towelhead riff-raff way of doing it though , good , wholesome european guillotines only !, 
  not modern enough ? 
  i know . 
  very pasee . 
  a gas chamber maybe ? 
  could round up the rest of her chums , family and acquaintances and stuff them in it too . 
  efficiency !, 
  ps : seek help immediately . 
  the number of refugees we 're taking in is fairly minimal and most of them do n't want to stay anyway . 
  not to mention that the refugee quota plan that seemed so inevitable before is now a lot more muddy . . 
  even if all that would go through , i 'd say the benefits far outweigh the odds . 
  as for our relations with the us , some might say they could be endangered based on some comments trump made . 
  but i think that even if he does win , the us establishment would n't permit him to mess up decades of foreign policy is eastern europe . 
  we nailed the hats of the estonian diplomats to their heads for this insult . 
  now the question remains , how do you foil ** all ** of these plans without doing away with a free society ? 
  organized terrorist attacks are one thing , but how do you stop a guy who was born in your country from strapping into his truck one day and plowing through a crowd ? 
  i would bet that they stopped plenty of organized attacks , but stopping the random ones is more or less impossible . 
  just think that if you 'd really want to , tomorrow , you could hop into your car and run over a whole bunch of pedestrians before anyone would have a chance to stop you . 
  you do n't do this because you 're not a crazy murderer , and you have things to lose ( guess who does n't ) , but you certainly ** could ** , if you 'd be inclined to . 
  i do n't think belief is irrelevant , but there are degrees of belief . 
  and one belief does n't make someone a wholly terrible person . 
  for instance , there are plenty of otherwise lovely and likeable religious people that might feel uncomfortable around certain groups , such as the lgbt community . 
  sure it 's unfortunate that they believe that but i do n't see someone who is uncomfortable and someone who is outright violent as the same ( obviously , you 'd think ) . 
  for a secular analogy : someone who says they 're a feminist is probably not a radfem tumblr poster with a blog about the evils of men and the depravity of the patriarchy , but quite often , that seems to be the perception , just because those that are that way tend to be very loud . 
  it goes the other way too , if you disagree with the loud ones in any way , they already mark you as some sort of insane medieval-age misogynist even though you never expressed such views . 
  i guess the tldr is that extremists suck , morality and worldviews are complicated , and everyone should try to be more nuanced and less quick to slot people into predefined camps based on very little information about them . 
  whenever i tell people in this subreddit ( or elsewhere really ) that they should treat people as individuals and judge them based on their own actions and words rather than where they come from or their religion , i 'm looked at with suspicion or even called some sort of `` super leftist libtard jihadi apologist blargh '' . 
  if you saw this guy on the street and did n't know who he was , there would be no way to differentiate him from his brother , who was not only an enemy of the west but an enemy of life in general . 
  in your daily life , leaving all the rhetoric aside , all you can ( or should ) do is treat other people kindly regardless of their colour , origin or beliefs . 
  everyone has innate prejudices , but if you are aware of them , you can work against them . 
  that , however , seems to be a contentious opinion nowadays though . 
  the question is loaded because what exactly `` fighting for your country '' means can be pretty vague . 
  does it mean defending your country if it 's borders were invaded ? 
  does it also mean invading other countries ? 
  when the soviets ( and the americans after them ) were in afghanistan were they fighting for their country or for the business interests of the elite ? 
  so yes , it 's certainly a loaded question , in fact i saw the infographic first and the term came to mind before i read the title again . 
  practicality and price . 
  and a machete can do plenty of damage , a chainsaw would be clumsy and where would you even get a claymore . 
  you would be surprised how many people never had to interact with the police and live in their own little world where the justice system is perfect and everything is awesome . 
   just do n't expect to be able to talk yourself up without anything to show for it . 
  dreams . 
  dashed . 
  10 is a particularly annoying thing that seems to happen all the time in romania . 
  whether you 're in a car in heavy traffic or waiting in a queue , people get the impression that if they sit really really close behind you , they will somehow get to their destination quicker . 
  again , i think the first thing i said was that this protest is bullshit , but for protests in general , you would be naive to think you can go protest in a little corner and get the same kind of media attention that you would if you 'd actually cause some inconvenience . 
  if there is gross injustice going on that only affects a minority ( ** will reiterate again that i do n't think this is true in this particular case ** ) , then loud and ` inconvenient ' protests are how you properly get attention . 
  appealing to people 's `` humanity and logic '' is all well and good but truth is , for most people , if it does n't affect them , it does n't exist . 
  if it does bother them , then maybe elected officials would start caring about something that is affecting their larger electorate and consequently , their chances of re-election . 
  maybe i 'm wrong , maybe the culture is different and in western countries quietly and obediently protesting infront of parliament ( lol ) works swimmingly . 
  think this protest is bullshit , but devil 's advocate here : if your protest does n't inconvenience , no one will give a shit . 
  if you 're trying to get your ideas to be seen by as many eyes as possible , you want media coverage and controversy is usually a great way to get it because of the way the media ( unfortunately ? ), 
  works . 
  considering the expression on his face during all those r'hllor scenes in earlier seasons , i seriously doubt stannis actually believed . 
  just compare the mesmerized look of his wife to his look of disgust or at least indifference when they 're burning people in s3 or 4 or whenever that was . 
  that 's interesting cos they did actually have a military coup that pushed the country far more towards islamization , and then another coup that lead to a more democratic ( by comparison at least ) regime .
