  besides , the notion that france is `` going sharia '' is comical at best . 
  all that happened here was some people rented out a water park for a day and they can do whatever they want there . 
  i suspect if the story was `` nudist-only day at french water park '' , no one would have cared . 
  probably never , consider [ there already is one and the world has n't ended ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pakistan ), 
  gta iv is haram anyway . 
  no doubt whoever was playing it was part of the subversive elements trying to topple ~ ~ the sultan ~ ~ democracy . 
  it 's true though . 
  it was politically difficult to declare war since the current sentiment among the population was that isolationism was for the best . 
  the embargo definitely set the us on a warpath with japan and i think you 'd be incredibly naive to assume they did n't know that . 
  now , whether they knew specifically about the pearl harbor attack or not , that 's more for the conspiracy theorists , but the rest would be silly to argue . 
  it 's not that different from how the bush administration used 9/11 as justification to invade the middle east . 
  of course i think the actual `` inside job '' conspiracy is just stupid since i doubt such a huge secret involving so many moving parts could be kept under wraps , but they certainly seized a convenient opportunity and used it . 
   we will never see the russian flag waving from capitol hill since trump has the most powerful army in the world plus enough nukes to destroy any invador . 
  i would rather see the russian flag on capitol hill ( as fantasy of a scenario as that is ) than , you know , the complete annihilation of the human race . 
  unless you 're pretending that they would n't fire all their nukes back or that you 'd be able to stop them . 
  i do n't think there are any pictures or any footage in which himmler does n't look ridiculously grumpy at all times . 
  even hitler and stalin regularly have footage of them smiling or laughing , this guy was just all grump all the time , i bet no one liked him . 
  honey it 's okay , you can go back to your twitch streamers and memes about jews now , we 're not mad that you stumbled into a subreddit for actual adults , shush now , it 's fine . 
  the communists would never do anything ever so beastly / s, 
  do n't pay attention to all the people who are trying to pretend they were n't forced . 
  they were . 
  the communists were in power and they could do whatever they wanted , there was nothing he could 've done to change these facts . 
  or maybe they 're talking about the arrest of marshal antonescu , in which case , they 're wrong again : the soviets would 've run roughshod all over the country and fucked us up even more than they did anyway . 
  romania sitting on hitler 's side to the end would n't have changed the outcome of the war . 
  there would have just been even more death . 
  i suppose he could 've defied the communists at every turn and then he 'd just get a bullet to the head , for all the good that would 've done . 
  i never said the solution is to pretend there is n't a problem and i think that came across in what i said about counter-narratives , there 's a lot to talk about in that context but unfortunately it 's more complicated than `` deport them all , build a wall and make them pay for it ! '', 
  so it does n't lend itself well to internet forums , where people assume they already know all about what you believe simply cos you said `` hey guys maybe thinking all the brown people are the same is bad k ? '', 
  regardless , i like to take individuals at face value . 
  their actions and their words are what matters to me , not where they come from or what colour their skin is . 
  i believe in things like self determination and individualism and i will never accept the position of `` uh , yeah , those brown people , better watch out '' . 
  to say that they 're all bad and we should hate them all as he did is reprehensible . 
  even if you take that 43 % statistic at face value , that means there are 57 % who are not that way , and i refuse to lump them in with the others . 
  this is all moot as far as romania goes since the muslim minority here is tiny and we 're not a serious target , but holy shit do i hate people who paint everyone with the same brush and then unironically call themselves european and talk about their superior civilizations . 
  i 'm very calm thanks . 
  i have no prejudice against roma , but they are associated with criminality . 
  its the same deal , only a certain % of them are criminals , but since they look and act different , people assume ** all ** roma are that way . 
  and then people assume all romanians are that way too , since that is their only interaction with romanian citizens , get it ? 
  of course you do . 
  you 're right that it 's up to muslims to figure it out , i 've always said that any kind of reform can only come from the inside , that respected figures in their communities must establish a counter-narrative to the one isis is using to draw in young , disenfranchised youth . 
  but this has nothing to do with any of that , the guy basically just said they 're all bad and put peaceful in triple quotation marks . 
  in his little world , anyone called mohammed is secretly plotting to blow himself up in the nearest crowd or at least does a little fist bump whenever this happens . 
  that kind of thinking is not any different from `` all jews are obsessed with money and con-men '' or `` all western women are whores '' , and i will call it out every time i see it no matter how much i get called a `` libtard '' `` pc radical '' or whatever else they come up with . 
  i never thought i 'd see the day when i 'd have to argue for maybe not indiscriminately hating whole ethnic groups or whole religions , but here we are . 
  you know what else is really annoying ? 
  injustice . 
  i 'm not muslim , i do n't really know any muslims , but fuck if i 'll not say anything when someone basically says the modern day equivalent of `` jews are evil '' . 
  i like to put myself in the shoes of others and think how i 'd feel if i were born into a muslim family , i would be minding my own business and some fucker would say i want to `` butcher '' him or blow myself up in a crowd just cos i have brown skin and a muslim name . 
  the answer is : it would be pretty shitty . 
  if this is n't something you can come to grips with , try this instead : a lot of westerners think all romanians are roma . 
  feels bad does n't it ? 
  i hope you 're fucking joking . 
  by that logic you ca n't tell if ** anyone ** will attack you . 
  guy with `` non conformist '' haircut ? 
  maybe he 's crazy . 
  guy with tattoos ? 
  was he in prison ? 
  will he mug me ? 
  brown person ? 
  i saw some brown people blow themselves up so what if this brown person also does that ?!, 
  death metal guy ? 
  [ what if he 's this guy ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f85az-frfr8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9s ) yes , the ideology is a problem . 
  yes , there are plenty of so called `` moderate sympathizers '' . 
  yes , western nations should n't have allowed in masses of people with a different culture all willy-nilly . 
  but `` all of them '' ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  are you really , literally saying that ? 
  can you take a moment to think about what you said ? 
  how about i replace muslim with jew ? 
  or with blacks ? 
  or any race/group really . 
  just out of curiosity i looked through the first page of your comments and all of them are about how terrible people who are n't exactly like you are , christ . 
  you are a racist . 
  no , not the vastly overused kind that all those radical leftist/pc types use , a ** real ** racist . 
  shame on you and on everyone who upvoted your shitty racist beliefs . 
  you are the antithesis of western culture and the enlightenment age beliefs that made our societies what they are today . 
  you are much more like the radical , savage part of the ethnic groups you hate than you would like to believe . 
  yes , go ahead , call me a `` brainwashed leftist '' , continue with your name calling and hateful ideology . 
  i only have this to say : you said millions of people are out to kill you . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , you are mentally ill . seek help immediately . 
  would never want to defend trump , but slight difference here : trump was talking about families abroad . 
  this does n't make it less despicable of course , but he did n't say `` lets kill us muslims if their kin were involved in anything terrorism related ! '', 
  i 'd want to say that saying something like that would go over very badly even with his electorate , but chances are , it probably would n't . 
   that should be your defensive argument in court , not the reason why you should n't have to go to court . 
  so i should waste a ton of time in court over the actions of someone who is functionally a stranger to me , just cos we share the same last name ? 
  sounds absolutely , completely mental to me . 
  thankfully this will never happen , and if it does , well , gg democracy . 
  i have family that i 've literally never spoken to , i have one 2nd generation cousin who is in america , a few aunts and uncles who are in moldova ( i 'm in bucharest ) and others heavens knows where . 
  anything they do has absolutely 0 to do with me and if they were to go crazy and kill a bunch of people it would have nothing to do with me . 
  any other stance is just collective punishment ala north korea or ussr . 
  as for parents if your kid is 18 + and no longer living with you then again , he/she bears full responsibility for their actions and unless there is evidence that you helped or encouraged them , any kind of punishment is grossly unjust . 
   family members should be legally obligated/motivated to pay closer attention to the opinions and attitude of at risk individuals , and involve themselves in the lives of these troubled people as if their life depended on it as well . 
  are you prepared to extend this process to ** yourself ** as well or are we only keeping it for the brown people ? 
  no problem . 
  we can just extend the same laws to everyone . 
  so when your hick cousin ion from the village who you have n't spoken to in 10 years caves someone 's head in with his hatchet while drunk , you and all your family get at least half of his punishment , sounds good ? 
   and that 's why people do n't run from that country yeah ... about that ... 
  the pirate is trying desperately to find a new niche electorate to cling onto for his new party . 
  utterly despicable as he may be , he is a cunning political creature and knows there is political capital to be gained by capitalizing on people 's fears and animosities .
