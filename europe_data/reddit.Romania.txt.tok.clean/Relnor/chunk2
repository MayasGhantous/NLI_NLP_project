  personally i doubt we can even properly care for that many . 
  brussels thinks we should take at least twice as many , i just know the authorities here will be as incompetent about this as anything else . 
  there 's also the whole sovereign state thing blah blah blah , but who are we kidding , we 've been a colony for a long time . 
  canada has some distinct advantages , such as this big ocean and their only border being with the most anti-immigration country ever . 
  i know this will sound shitty to any ukranian - but ukraine is not worth the potential repercussions of an all-out east vs west war . 
  europe/nato can support ukraine in other ways , directly ? 
  that 's just insane . 
  putin got his new buffer/frozen conflict , he wo n't be rolling to kiev , why would he ? 
  what 's there to gain out of that ? 
  russia can only sort itself out by the way , we ca n't force them to become more democratic , it has to come from their own people , hopefully it will come before 2065 . 
  as reasonable as this sounds , the actual terrorists are n't reasonable people ( duh ) and might not think about repercussions . 
  not to mention lone wolves do n't have to be directly affiliated with isis to be inspired by their 'cause ' . 
  the whole ` dem turrurists ar herez ! '', 
  shtick is largely scaremongering though , it does n't offer a solution and is just good ol `` you 're different , we do n't want you here , eff off '' . 
  time for incredibly unpopular statement again : the vast majority of the people coming in today are not and will never be interested in being terrorists . 
  no worries , none of them want to move here in eastern europe anyway . 
  in fact , i 'd be willing to bet they 'd even feel a little ashamed to blow themselves up in a square here . 
  i do n't think i 'd put `` assad '' and `` justice '' in the same sentance , considering he gasses children . 
  you have this three or four pronged war in which so far the us has been involved bombing isis and , in a more limited fashion , bombing assad to help the supposedly moderate rebels . 
  in the last few days now we 've seen news about russia moving in to prop-up the assad regime and starting their own bombing/attacks on isis - this part is good , but the part about helping assad ? 
  what happens when us and russian aircraft meet on ostensibly different sides ? 
  it 's a more volatile and messy situation than you 're making it out to be . 
  do n't agree with the lady , even think some of the things she 's saying are ridiculous , but she should absolutely be allowed to say them . 
  i do n't think public discourse should be silenced to protect the feelings of muslims , christians , jews or even pastafarians . 
  free speech is more precious than any of their feelings and should be afforded to even the most hateful rather than even a slight risk of a slippery slope where ever less radical thoughts are considered unfit for public debate . 
  i 'm not trying to justify her - as i said with my first words , it too was an overreaction . 
  but the proportions are . . different . 
  i do n't know if the teachers involved were racist . 
  maybe they do n't feel they 're racist , maybe they did n't even think `` oh he 's called mohammed so better watch out for the bombs '' , but they reacted the way they did because certain ideas about his ethnic group ( some legit , others exagerated ) have been repeated to them again and again by people with agendas . 
  one of the cops , upon seeing the kid , purportedly said something along the lines of `` yeah , i knew it must 've been you '' - i 'd expect a police officer to be more balanced , but hey , i also expect a solution to the middle east , and we know we 're not getting either . 
  an overreaction as well , but i hope i do n't have to point out the difference between suspending someone for disrupting class ( as the article you linked says ) and arresting someone and interrogating him without a parent/guardian present . 
  one is a dumb teacher getting fed up with a kid that was probably being annoying , the other is creepy and certainly racial . 
  even if it was a ` hoax ' as some people say ( which i do n't really believe ) , they sure fell for it , hook line and sinker - says a lot about the people working there . 
  it 's a kid who did n't actually do anything wrong , but the supposedly well balanced adults in the school went batshit crazy over him . 
  there 's a difference between being cautious and seeing bombs on every corner when an arabic name is mentioned . 
  this kid was born in america , his parents are immigrants - his father is part of a smaller islamic denomination that is apperantly more liberal . 
  i do n't know a lot about them , so i wo n't claim to know if this would make a difference - but to those texas teachers , it was all the same . 
  imagine yourself being young and well intentioned and being met with suspicion and disdain at every turn , because of your name and/or skin colour , fun , no ? 
  this kid seems smart , he 's seen a lot of support , so it probably wo n't get to him , but who 's to say there are n't 100 other muslim kids who also just want an easy , quiet life , who are n't looking to blow anyone up , but met with derrision at every corner , turn to despicable imams who see them as nothing more than cruise missiles with sneakers . 
  it 's basically `` how to help radicalization 101 '' . 
  i have n't explained what i meant - they 're competitors , yes , but he has certainly been at the tip of the spear of this kind of movement - is he more `` moderate '' than jobbik ? 
  yes . 
  but i can easily see people inspired by his ideas go further . 
  i suppose an analogy ( although i do n't believe in it , but it gets the point across ) is like gateway drugs , you take the weed first or whatever , then move to harder stuff . 
  neither is croatia , yugoslavia all the way . 
  oh i 'm sorry , is it not as funny when people do it to you ? 
  sure , the problem is , when and how does the war in syria end ? 
  i know it 's unpopular to say , but if the kid would 've been white he would 've had to do a whole lot worse before the police were called in . 
  whoever went straight to `` it must be a bomb ! '', 
  because the guy was called mohammed should n't be a teacher . 
  oh but mr.orban is not a maniac at all - he 's a great politician , he 's appealing to a very specific group that 's a mixture of right wing/nationalists/christians who have felt somewhat disenfranchised for a long time now . 
  ofcourse when you push too far what do you get ? 
  groups like jobbik - they 're not his party , but you can bet they 'd be less successful if he was n't around , and what do they do ? 
  they 're anti gays , anti reproductive rights and just generally anti western values . 
  incidentally , i think a slightly brushed up version of trump would be very popular with the same crowd too . 
  is n't that great ? 
  honestly though , i do n't even know if mr.orban really believes everything he says , but he 's playing the part really well - then again , watching the romanian political scene has made me pretty cynical about anything politicians say . 
  at least geoana would 've just been bad . 
  careful , mr.orban is this sub 's sweetheart , anything except the best said about him will see you downvoted to hell . 
  you forgot the reptillians operating from their underground city under la. 
  there absolutely are radical agents seeded amongst the refugees . 
  there also absolutely are people that are trying to find a better life , you know , like everyone else . 
  by all means , arrest this guy , interrogate him for what else he knows , when you 're done with him , deport him - but infering that they 're all terrorists ? 
  pretty low . 
  ofcourse , `` dey al turrurists '' will get upvotes , while if i say that maybe not all of them want to detonate themselves in public squares , i 'm an insane libtard . 
  yeah obviously the 14 yo wanted to get frisked by police officers and expelled from school . 
  quite the contrary - just as the internet can be an incredible tool for spreading information , it 's also an amazing tool for spreading misinformation . 
  i 'm not a math surgeon , but personally i find the chart hard to misinterpret , you just look at the bar you care about , then peer over to the left and see whereabouts the scale it ends . 
  ofcourse , they could 've avoided all potential misinterpretations with a simple list of countries with numbers by their names . 
  please , president klaus verner iohannis was very clear - ** 1875 refugees ** - i hope you 're impressed with our german precision , many of the people here certainly are !, 
  but yes , knowing our authorities , i would n't be surprised at all if we could n't provide for them . 
  saw the news about tents being built outside these poor villages for the refugees to come - wonder how our peasants will get along with people that might as well be from another world as far as they know . 
  sorry , just a short question , does this happen to be your ringtone ? 
  - https://youtu.be/2ygdt7ptyle?t=5s, 
  the rich arab states are n't lifting a finger to help though . 
  they 'll never accept refugees , especially if they 're not of the same religious denomination . 
  yesterday i said some really unpopular things about how the refugees are also humans ( shocking i know ) , for which i got tons of downvotes , obviously . 
  allow me to alienate the other side too now : saudi arabia and the other rich arab countries are still tribal in nature . 
  yes they look civilized with their big shiny white skyscrapers and what not , but they 're not . 
  they would rather dominate these regions than help them , they do not share our values , a few million dollars would be nothing to them and would go a long way towards solving some problems , but it 's not going to happen . 
  tbh i have doubts we can handle even the number that was proposed ( what was it , 1875 ? 
  we 'll be forced to take more refugees , and the authorities will probably fumble it with our trademark incompetence . 
   i sometimes feel like being `` leftist '' for some people is just some kind of scene and youth movement and basically you have to take the full package what comes with very conform views , attitude and clothing and the like . 
  heavens forbid you 're a balanced person and agree with some ideas from the left and some from the right - if you do that , both groups will ** hate ** you - the leftists will attribute all the right wing attributes to you , and vice versa . 
  more like i no longer saw things in clear cut , black & white lines . 
  ( i 'm 24 btw ), 
  they might not be in the government - but their 20 % parliamentary result is huge for what is a fascist party . 
  nevermind the rhetoric that their leaders spout that has nothing to do with civilized europe - just go have a look at some images of their rallies . 
  ofcourse , you know these things , but if you favour them , you 'll fervently deny it . 
  i feel sorry for all the hungarians who are being mis-represented by these xenophobic , homophobic , goose-stepping hooligans . 
  in iraq 's case at least , europe put the minority in power ( sunnis ) basically so the majority ( shia ) would n't murder them all - obviously , this caused a ton of resentment . 
  now there is big money and political will to keep iraq in it 's artificial form - even if isis were to vanish from the face of the earth ( would n't that be sweet ? 
  ) , sectarian violence would continue unimpeded with the status quo . 
  splitting the country along more natural , cultural/ethnic lines ** might ** lead to peace , but aperantly peace is unpopular . 
  so would you stay or leave ? 
  cause in one sentance you said you would and in one you would n't =p you have to keep in mind though that iraq is n't like usa or a european country . 
  they 're a post ww1 construct , they do n't even really belong together , the people who are staying and dieing ? 
  they 're not dieing for iraq , they 're dieing for their families , or their local tribe . 
  perhaps in the future we 'll see the country split along sunni/shia lines , and there might be some peace , but as long as isis is there and the rich arab states wo n't lift a finger , it 's not going to happen . 
  sweet ?
