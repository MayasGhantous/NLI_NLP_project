  not even donald trump managed to say something this ridiculous . 
  where do you deport people who were born in these western countries ? 
  you 're right . 
  it probably will happen . 
  and the person that does it will be just as reprehensible as the jihadists are now . 
  he will not be a hero , he will be scum all the same and wholly an enemy of life . 
  i 'm not sure what is worse though , the fact that you are giddy about it or that so many people upvoted you . 
  so much for being the civilized ones . 
  so nowadays even ethnic cleansing gets a `` so ? '', 
  on / r/europe , maybe the subreddit needs a new name for our united continent , think they had quite a cool sounding one in the early 40s . 
   if you leave those countries alone they will probably consolidate into an isis super state , run over israel and then start an invasion of europe , full jihad , like the middle ages bit dramatic do n't you think ? 
  why would these states want to consolidate into an isis super state ? 
  iran is shiite , they hate their guts , and isis is n't about to walk all over iran , you 're vastly overestimating their reach . 
  even other sunni majority states in the region would n't want to give up their sovereignty to be ruled by a bunch of extremists . 
  as for israel ... two words : nuclear weapons . 
  impossible . 
  surely any terrorists on us soil would be wiped out by good guys with guns . 
  same here . 
  two weeks ago it would 've probably went by unreported outside local news , but not now , even if it does n't seem to be related . 
  welp , looks like this is already not the case . 
  the vile leftist reptillian agenda tried to obfuscate the truth about the innately violent and sadistic nature of all brown people by changing his name to something white and wholesome . 
  alternatively , he was called david so they `` added '' david to his name . 
  it 's almost as if people with similar beliefs are drawn to each other regardless of their political or religious ideology ... 
   the local mayor released a statement early on , that got zero little press afterwards . 
  you remember wrong then . 
  it did get some press , but ** it stopped because it turns out there was no bomb ** . 
  no bomb . 
  no story . 
  no press . 
  also there was little press because , you know , all hell broke loose in paris . 
  never walked past a burnt out car in my life , maybe i complain about romania too much < 3, 
  ridiculous . 
  so if a guy goes and shoots up a mosque , it 's cool ? 
  you do n't have a problem with that ? 
  you do n't have a problem with the barbaric violence that the culture you 're supposedly so afraid of losing is against ? 
  seems people tend to be shitty everywhere . 
  regardless of nationality , religion or lack of . 
  who 'd have thunk it . 
  if the details that are coming out are confirmed , then according to this attack , we 'll have to nuke ourselves . 
  you down ? 
  an id card , like this - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:idrou.jpg you get one when you are 14 yo . 
  what a clown . 
  you 'd think a grown ass man would know better than to joke like this , especially if he 's a public official . 
  he should never hold any office again , even if he did n't really mean what he said , it was grossly irresponsible . 
  i 'll assume that was a joke . 
  you reminded me of the story about that pastor and the `` virtual cyber demons '' . 
  children are pretty good at separating fantasy from reality , i will never understand why some adults are so bad at it . 
  is this like the lasers created by students that melted soviet tanks in 1968 ? 
   it could be so easy . 
  i wish it would be , but it really is n't . 
  it is simple to read about cases like this and say `` well if i were there i would 've done xyz '' but instead imagine you 're on your daily boring commute that you 've done 1000 times before , you 're either half awake cos it 's morning or tired after work and you 've never had to use that weapon of yours before . 
  then bam - before you know what is happening someone with an axe/gun/etc just killed someone , people are running and screaming everywhere - you do n't even ** see ** the attacker right away . 
  it really is n't that simple . 
  then take something like the shooting in orlando . 
  can you imagine what would 've happened if multiple people in that club were armed ? 
  they would 've just shot the attacker , right ? 
  probably not , what would 've probably happened was a lot of people would draw their guns - then you have lets say 6 armed people and there are bullets flying . 
  as one of those people how do you know which is the `` good guy with a gun '' and which is the `` bad guy '' ? 
  he wo n't be wearing an easily identifiable uniform or a turban or whatever , will be just like any other dude , and you have to make a split second decision , if you run into someone else with a gun - shoot or not ? 
  being paranoid and armed sounds like a great combination . 
  no doubt more to it , but usually i would guess it 's about disenfranchised people who feel like they do n't belong in their society . 
  feeling like they 're part of something bigger is pretty important for a lot of people and for these people who do n't get that feeling , poisonous ideology such as that of islamic radicalism can be very attractive . 
  you 'll never see one of these attackers described as someone who was very popular , had a lot of friends , a great job , etc. 
  because no one who is like that ( ie : who has things to lose ) would do this , regardless of their religion . 
  this is why i would say the solution is not murdering everyone not because `` oh no it 's immoral '' or whatever , but because it probably would n't work - what you really need is some kind of counter-narrative , preferably from people like them ( in this case other muslims ) that can make them feel like they `` belong '' in a peaceful and productive manner . 
  there is n't such a narrative yet , at least not a loud one . 
  the only loud narrative is the one isis puts out , maybe that will change sometime . 
  [ ahem . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3tokbq/france_can_now_shut_down_any_website_and_search/cx7ypit?context=3 ), 
   that will make them think twice about going to syria will it , though ? 
  if you know anything about criminal psychology ( not claiming i 'm an expert ) , you 'd know this kind of punishment is n't a deterrent . 
  what makes you think it is any different with terrorists ? 
  sounds to me like all you 'd be doing is handing the bad guys amazingly effective and free propaganda and perhaps even more importantly - possibly killing someone innocent , which is completely unacceptable . 
  and what does ` connection ' mean ? 
  what about family members ? 
  that 's a connection , right ? 
  will we be rounding up families and killing them ? 
  how will these laws work ? 
  ** how do you prevent a police state from using these laws against other people unrelated to terrorism ** ? 
  same reason you 're on reddit while still having stormfront , i would guess . 
   and saying that you should ask the kid when he 's older is kind of stupid . 
  it 's painful and at that age you 'll remember it if you 're a true believer , you 'll do it anyway . 
  if not , then hey , you 're not getting bits of yourself chopped off . 
   plenty of kurdish women have been captured and brutally raped , no thanks . 
  and plenty of men in every conflict ever have ** died ** . 
  as in , you know , you 're gone forever . 
  no thanks i guess ? 
  these people that sign up know the risks , if they decide to do so anyway , how is it our place to say `` no , you might get raped '' ? 
  also , attachments ? 
  are we dealing with professional soldiers here or a troupe of clowns ? 
  i will not disrespect people that put their lives on the line in an armed conflict by assuming they 'll forget their hundreds of hours of gruelling training and just go `` fuck it , got to save the chick ! '' . 
  it 's what you would try to do , it 's probably what i would try to do , but i hold these people to higher standards . 
  so in other words you do n't actually care about justice or treating others decently , you just have a dislike for a vague and complex group of people who do not all behave the same way or hold the same values . 
  sounds awfully familiar . 
  `` cue claims by russian and transnistrian officials that ukraine and moldova are imposing an economic blockade ; civic leaders in transnistria last week appealed to russian president vladimir putin to protect them `` in case of emergency '' . 
  on monday , dmitry rogozin , russia 's hard-line deputy premier , assured transnistria 's leadership that `` russia will always be there '' to ensure regional security . '', 
  - http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/06/transnistria-shapes-up-as-next-ukraine-russia-flashpoint/ `` a senior russian politician said on sunday he had brought to moscow a petition by residents of moldova 's russian-speaking , breakaway region of transdniestria backing union with russia . 
  dmitry rogozin 's comments will further rattle moldova , an impoverished former soviet republic which , like neighboring ukraine , is seeking closer ties with europe but faces stiff resistance from moscow . '',

   france is becoming less and less relevant on the world stage and holland is n't helping it .
