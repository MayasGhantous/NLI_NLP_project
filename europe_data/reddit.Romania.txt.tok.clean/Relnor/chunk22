  i 'd be more scared of them than these attacks . 
   take them to the woods alternative : point your weapons at them while ordering them to dig holes in the forest . 
  once they 're done , let them sweat a little bit , then bring out saplings for them to plant . 
   would have removed themselves further and further from catholicism in a bid for power and with that their religion would have changed a lot . 
  they did do that . 
  it was called the great schism . 
  it resulted in orthodoxy . 
  as long as chicks do n't ruin video games the fabric of our society will remain intact . 
  go back and ask for the rest of the sock , you 've clearly been cheated . 
  its fine , it just does n't make sense logically . 
  if you were in 1943 europe and said `` i think fascism is beginning to fall in europe '' it would make sense , fascism had taken over europe and now we 're seeing its downfall . 
  trumpism ( whatever that means anyway ) has n't taken over europe in the first place . 
  to be honest though , i take more issue with the whole `` elections are on schedule '' part . 
  as much as i do n't like trump or people like him , that is some very unfortunate phrasing for people who , as they say at the end `` still believe in a liberal democratic west . '', 
  they do it a lot . 
  japanese have a whole type of words ( essentially imported words ) written in a different script . 
  usually they 're bastardizations of english words , though sometimes other languages too . 
  everything from `` konpyuuta '' and `` hambagaa '' and `` furaido poteto '' to weird ones that do n't even make sense like `` baikingu '' ( viking ) for all you can eat restaurants . 
  you do n't have to imagine anything , he was very explicit : `` women are less intelligent , pay them less . '', 
  i do n't like extremists , i do n't like alt righters or sjws , but fucking hell , if hating this guy makes me an extreme lefty or something , so be it - fuck this guy and his hillbilly opinions . 
  isis claims responsibility ? 
   it 's just how the westerners roll , i 'm getting used to it . 
  why do you cherry pick what insane people say to fit your narrative ? 
  nobody wants nuclear war - it could possibly lead to extinction and at very least certainly lead to the collapse of our societies . 
  it 's a shitty deal for everyone - no one wins . 
  do you know how many times russian officials threatened romania ? 
  should i say `` it 's just how russians roll '' cos rogozin repeatedly barked about `` visiting romania in a bomber '' ? 
  hell , he 's an official representative , i 'd have more of a point than you basing it all off what some random prick on reddit said . 
  considering the trump administration 's stance towards iran , i 'd find it way more likely that they get attacked first . 
  not nuclear , ofc . 
  also , this might just be me being cynical , but i feel the whole `` we will burn israel in nuclear fire ! '', 
  is just rhetoric for the conservative population - the people in charge are n't stupid ( / coughusa/cough ) - they know it 's the end of their country if they start a nuclear war . 
  faith is for the little people , officials pray to realpolitik . 
  are these the same no-go zones like the ones fox news told me about in birming ~ ~ ham ~ ~ or are they different ? 
  i mean , if that 's the logic you 're going to use , why not just commit genocide and be done with it ? 
  only one little genocide and all your problems will be solved !, 
   usually racists are forced to confront their stupidity once they are in contact with the other . 
  so if this is n't happening , could it possibly have something to do with the behaviour of said other rather than the people being horrible racists ? 
  you 're aware that people live there , right ? 
  why should * those * people want them any more than we do ? 
  [ the ~ ~ romanians ~ ~ british are coming !, 
  distant indeed , no burnt cars , no shops broken into . 
  very un-european / s, 
  soldiers are supposed to follow orders , not to be smart . 
  if you were told to carry your weapon , you will do it . 
  regardless the idea that them holding their weapons has anything to do with insecurity is ... silly at best . 
  i 've played both wot and war thunder , but i was pretty familiar with the vehicles before - i 'm sure a true grognard can come along and say exactly what version of stug and panther those are though . 
  tanks in ukraine ? 
  the pictured tanks are obviously a panther , a stug ( early version ? 
  short barrel ) and the blurry one seems like a pz ii - obviously these are just ww2 reenactors , nothing to worry about komrads , just fake news . 
  he pays for the upvotes too , all the allegedly opposing left/right wing leaders are actually his agents - kind of like the illuminati in the deus ex game we do n't like to talk about . 
   have their own unique language . 
  * triggered *, 
  as far as i 'm concerned iran is as natural an ally against sunni terrorism as the ussr was against the nazis . 
  it * is * more complicated than that though and as far as i see it trump is just pushing for war with them . 
  ( you can check his tweets - they 're the best tweets , everyone says so ), 
  take note rioters across the world ( regardless of political affiliation , i do n't give a shit ) - peaceful protests are not only possible but also effective . 
  apart from some agitators a few days ago , every day has been peaceful . 
  people were having fun - they did n't burn shops down , they did n't light cars on fire , they did n't attack the police . 
  you can look at any of the footage - it was a nice and friendly atmosphere , people were angry at the government , yes , but they were happy/proud to be there rather than use it as an excuse for anarchy . 
  the constant demonisation of the press is the worst part as far as i 'm concerned . 
  do outlets have biases ? 
  yup . 
  they all do , to various degrees . 
  when you rabidly consider all opposition against you fake/paid off/lying/etc though , you start conditioning your supporters to think its ok for these outlets to be marginalized or banned - by the time you 're done , they 'll be cheering you on ( this part already happened , see the `` you 're fake news ! '', 
  shout out to cnn - many `` keks '' were praised that day ) when you shut them down . 
  perhaps more importantly , not related to freedom - climate change . 
  i would vote * anyone * - ** anyone ** - left , right wing , super conservative , super lib - whatever - instead of trump simply because of his stance on climate change - that on it 's own should have had him thrown out . 
  unfortunately that 's long term damage and people do n't have the foresight to not fucking smoke nevermind to protect our world . 
  there were other things - the casual , grossly unpresidential tone he constantly has on twitter , the provocative tone - yesterday he said `` iran is playing with fire '' ( enjoy that war sometime in the next 4 years btw ) , the narcisism , the volatile reaction to any form of criticism - how should we put it . . 
  sad ? 
  i mean seriously , i get it , the democrats were arrogant fucks that thought that the election was in the bag from the start and they could run whoever they wanted , but christ , potentially millions of people will now be screwed in various ways because the clintons wanted another go and they miscalculated how effective trumpian populism could be . 
  the parliament is psd/alde majority - it wo n't go away if its up to parliament . 
  this bill will only go away under public and outside ( eu ) pressure . 
  in theory : why not ? 
  in reality : france is a pillar of the eu and they will never mess with them . 
  that said , i approve of them forcing psd 's hand . 
  excellent . 
  this has to happen . 
  the convict ( s ) that are currently leading this puppet government need their hand forced - they tried to weather out the protests , hoping people would get too tired/cold/hopeless and just give up . 
  they ca n't weather the eu though - even for them , romania getting this sort of penalty will tarnish that entire party 's already shoddy reputation so deeply , they will never recover . 
  i hope it 's a serious threat - serious enough for the 2nd echelon in psd to say `` oh shit , we 'll be pariahs for life if this happens , lets not pass this law ** made just for our party chief ** '' . 
  this is an opportunity for the eu to use it 's power to do something unequivocally good . 
  western countries with long traditions of democracy can whinge about eu regulations or infringement on their sovereignty , but some of us , we need to be forced in the right direction . 
  the violent `` protesters '' are paid scum , members of football galleries ( so brain about the size of a walnut ) , who 's only purpose is to cause a diversion and give the police a reason to disperse the otherwise peaceful crowd . 
  the gallery leader has close affiliations with a bigwig of the party currently in government and they are a common occurrence at any protest against or celebration of this particular party . 
  this is not the us , we do not shoot police officers and pretend we did a good thing . 
  ironically , isis banned the burqa and niqab in their territories because other groups were assassinating their leaders dressed up like that . 
  no one is asking for a ban on the hijab though - the hijab does n't conceal your face . 
  niqabs and burqas though , they should be banned for the same reason you 're not allowed to go into public buildings wearing motorcycle helmets , ski masks or pumpkins . 
  something really drastic would have to happen in eu-russian relations for ukraine/moldova/georgia to join the eu . 
  eeh , true . . 
  i was only half serious - there are plenty of other good reasons to not stand close to the edge - someone could bump into you by mistake ( everyone staring at their smartphones ... ) , losing your balance for whatever reason , etc. . of course , scum like this is pretty rare and i would n't expect random people to try and push me in front of a train - still would n't sit inches away from the edge tho . 
  this is why i always sit close to the wall or in the middle if there is n't one . 
  when i see all these people waiting right on the edge for whatever reason , i think about how i could push them and there would be no way to stop me . . seriously , why do some of you sit there ? 
  why should it be illegal to bash him ? 
  thought republicans were pro 1st amendment and small government ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  how many times removed from her do you have to be to not suffer this collective punishment ? 
  i guess children , parents , siblings would go right away - what about cousins though ? 
  2nd cousins ?
