  lets assume in cases where the attacker is older , the parents have n't been in contact with them for years or even decades , do they still go ? 
  still their fault right ? 
  `` fuck the ragheads '' , no ? 
  whats that ? 
  north korea is barbaric ? 
  damn right !, 
  with their political murders and their collective punish - oh . ~, 
  bad idea on the referendum - you know what will happen here , the more organized and zealous psd electorate will come out en masse , while the majority will not care . 
  sprinkle in some fraud too , and the bill will pass just as they want - after that happens , he ca n't say anything anymore , it was ` the will of the people ' , right ? 
  just change the things wrong with the bill - no amnesty for corruption , no amnesty for suspended sentences ( lol . . ) , let petty , non-violent offenders go , especially the older , and that 's it . 
  snark aside , the bill also pardons corruption cases with ** suspended sentences ** ( as in , not going to prison ) , this is why there are protests . 
  just a lot of older people that are used to voting this way , psd is the most recognizable political `` brand '' in romania . 
  it does n't help that the opposition is either a laughable mess that is only slightly better ( pnl ) or still new on the scene ( usr ) . 
  it will die down by then , in fact i 'd be surprised if there would still be anyone out by this time next week . 
  even if they do n't , it 's not a problem for tourists , there is n't any danger of it becoming violent , it 's not ukraine or syria . 
  the main problem as i see it with the bill is largely the fact that , for some bizarre reason , people with * suspended sentences * ( as in , not going to prison ) are also getting amnesty . . when supposedly this bill is being touted as reducing overpopulation in prisons ( which is a true problem ) . 
  then what is the case ? 
  why are they getting pregnant with these unwanted children ? 
  where is their contraception ? 
  again , i 'm all for abortions , but if you willfully had unprotected sex and are then `` oh gosh darn it , abort ! '', 
  - you 're uneducated . 
  it 's still lack of education - abortions can be damaging to your body , even if they 're accepted , it 's not something you just want to have willy nilly . 
  and i 'm talking purely from a pragmatic pov , i 'm not particularly convinced by arguments that having an abortion is immoral or `` wrong '' - you should just be using contraception in the first place and never get there . 
  sure there is , just like anywhere else in europe . 
  it 's the lack of education that leads to pregnancies . 
  interestingly enough , it was only like that since the late 60s , before that it was very open and the rate was ridiculously high , like 80 % + . . 
  it did result in a birth rate surge , but only for a short time before people found ways around it . 
  one wonders how many people will still be `` praising kek '' 2 years from now - when all you have is promises you 're free to dream and be hopeful , but then things actually have to be put into practice ... 
  when you have the kind of populist discourse trump does , the actual results will almost inevitably be disappointing . 
  in any case , short of anything really dramatic , we wo n't be seeing any big results until 1-2 years later . 
  good luck o /, 
  kind of rich coming from someone that is mad with fucking chemo patients and other people in extreme suffering getting a bit of relief . 
  wait what - they did n't allow phones and cameras in the louvre when i was there . . then again , that was in like 2007 . 
  am i the only one that feels uncomfortable about the ussr nuclear arsenal being `` rounded up meh we 're not sure '' ? 
  one mcdonalds meal is n't going to kill you , if it 's your only meal that week though and you refuse it , then that might . 
   culturally and geopolitically it is not european . 
  except . . they 've been involved in every major european power struggle since the napoleonic wars at the least ? 
  culturally could you really with a straight face say that the likes of tolstoy and dostoyevsky are * asian * writers ? 
  c'mon now really , i hate what the soviets were and disapprove of the current russian government too , but this kind of historical revisionism is stupid . 
  no-go zone !, 
  would n't be at all shocked if the guy gets impeached at some point during the next 4 years . 
  if you think the gop are his friends and they would n't do it , just remember that after his impeachment the 36th potus would be mike pence . 
  i ca n't wait personally , the twitter meltdown during the impeachment will be amazing . 
   devolved to into an islamist socialist union . 
  whoa !, 
  news to me . . incidentally , did you hear about the 1000 muslims that burnt down a cathedral in koln ? 
  [ to be fair ] ( https://gazetadespania.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lia-olguta-vasilescu.jpg ) , the lighting in that one is pretty unflattering . 
  then again , the woman on the left is probably half her age . 
  whenever you think about why powerful people will do something , you should ask a simple question : `` what money ( or power ) is there to be gained in doing x ? '', 
  so lets test it here : what $ $ $ is there to be made in turning what could be a large , lucrative and exploitable market with a huge population into a glass crater ? 
  dead people wo n't buy your shit - your megacorporations ca n't open up new chapters in smoking ruins - seems like a pretty shitty deal overall . 
  current population trends are hardly a good indicator for what will happen * generations from now * . 
  i seriously do n't know why you buy into this narrative that the birthrates of african migrants would remain unhindered across generations . 
  hell , we do n't even know what europe will be like 50 years from now - you know - just like if you would 've asked a european about it in 1967 , they would 've almost certainly been wrong . 
  by the way , most people do n't hate themselves , you should stop conflating stuff you read on the internet from vocal minorities with how the average person in a country feels . 
  it 's the same as thinking all trump supporters are / r/the _ donald trolls or all people who consider themselves feminists are like the shit you read on / r/tumblrinaction, 
  the robots already exist , and they do n't have to be ais to put millions of people out of jobs . 
  just think about everyone in the transportation industry being replaced by self driving vehicles - those already exist , today , and they 're already better than humans . 
  the benefits of replacing your truckers , taxi drivers and deliverymen with unblinking , tireless robots who do n't get stupid behind the wheel is undeniable . 
  obviously , not everyone will go at once , they 'll be replaced slowly , but it 's something we do have to think about ahead of time . 
  destruction of their nation , what ? 
  who ? 
  where ? 
  too much of that ` fake news ' maybe ? 
  as for making fun , riffing on nationality is a time-honored tradition , it , believe it or not , brings people closer together rather than dividing them . 
  if you think you 're being patriotic by getting defensive whenever someone makes a joke at your country 's expense , you 're hugely mistaken , try some self-deprecating humour every now and then , it will do you good to not take yourself so seriously all the time . 
  i also ca n't possibly conceive how you 'd think anyone in the eu wants to `` re-fight ww2 '' ( ?! ), 
  or fight any war at all - again - less breitbart , maybe ? 
   well , get ready for that cranked to 11 , on cocaine , with smaller hands and a shittier haircut . 
  the tweets . 
  the tweets will be glorious . 
  incidentally if you guys get someone else and put him in a replica oval office with just twitter access and aides indulging him , do you think that would work ? 
  you could even make a reality show !, 
  just fyi this kind of bellicose attitude is the kind of stuff people in europe usually do when they 're making caricatures of americans . 
  oh , and the whole hegemonic `` you exist only by our good graces '' is n't very much in the american spirit either , or is that only celebrated when it 's favourable to you ? 
  i know certain other places where he would 've been dead ten times over for the behaviour on display here . 
   a rise out of the leftists ironic , considering the history of the thing she was praising . 
  1 in romania , the refugee crisis simply is n't a subject . 
  a literal handful of refugees are housed somewhere out in the countryside and otherwise no one wants to come here since we do n't really have the opportunities for skilled workers or the welfare state for those who want a free ride . 
  if you ask the average person , i think they do n't want them here . 
  personally i have pretty mixed feelings - people from war torn countries should get help , but i also do n't want minorities that ca n't integrate living in enclaves ala belgium or france - if they do stay here , it should be temporary , when it 's safe again , they should go back and rebuild their own country . 
  2 i 've traveled around western europe some but i 'm a very unimaginative eater so i have n't tried any special local dishes , all i will say is that i ate better in germany than in france  3 romanian movies often have that typical eastern european depressing feeling about them , tackling subjects such as [ the corrupt and uncaring healthcare system ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456149/ ) or the [ `` golden age '' of romanian communism ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032846/?ref_=nm_knf_i1 ) - they 're quite authentic , though . 
  i ca n't think of a lot of well translated books where the meaning or social context is n't lost on someone who is n't romanian or at least eastern euroepan , though . 
   it just says that the man ought to have the final say in many matters . 
  why ? 
  probably wo n't work - i 'd prefer an aggressive campaign that paints smoking as a ** stupid ** habit only indulged in by idiots and hoping it seeps enough into society that it becomes an `` uncool '' habit and those who do it are ostracized . 
  social ostracization is more powerful than any ban a government could ever impose . 
  most anti-smoking campaigns say its unhealthy - nope - that does n't work , people have a hard time understanding long term health effects . 
  tell them they 're morons or they 're not manly/feminine/patriotic / whatever if they do it though , hit their self esteem , that works better . 
  of course , older smokers will bitch and say they 're being persecuted but who cares ? 
  the lives and health of future potential smokers are more important , both to their families and to the government who wo n't have to pay for their lung cancers later . 
  you 're not permitted to use sidewalks , there are * some * cycling lanes , but mostly in parks and the likes . 
  you ca n't really get from point a to b on a bicycle without weaving through traffic . 
  it 's both horrifying and exciting to see the memefication of politics . 
  but then how will cyclists have an [ exciting commute ] ( https://youtu.be/lcsqzhrsohy?t=24s ) every day ? 
  you guys should take note from us instead . 
  if mr.asylum seeker was rejected by germany for being too dangerous/suspicious , why should one of us take him instead ? 
  from the article - `` how to proceed with rejected asylum seekers , including holding potentially more dangerous rejected asylum seekers seen as islamists in detention before they are deported . '', 
  this is about * rejected * asylum seekers , not quotas or regular refugees . 
  so really , why should romania , or poland or any other eastern eu country take these dangerous criminals ?
