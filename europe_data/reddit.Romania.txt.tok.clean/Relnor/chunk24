  not that they want to be here anyway , not enough glory in killing us . 
  fortunately , no one is asking for that , which you would have known if you even skimmed the article - they 're talking about the countries of ** origin ** of these potentially radicalized asylum seekers . 
  why would asylum seekers rejected by the eu try to go to other eu countries ? 
  * feeling * safe is important too , it 's certainly not arbitrary , i know it 's popular nowadays to laugh at `` feels over reals '' and all that , when ironically the whole human experience ( regardless of gender ) is mired in feelings and irrationality and even when you do push back against it , your * feelings * remain important to your mental health , regardless of how vulcan you pretend to be . 
  i can ask women about what it 's like to be catcalled and followed by groups of strangers , they can give me the details and explain what it felt like , but i ca n't pretend i * really * understand it because it 's not something i experience . 
  as a man , i 'm not particularly afraid of a dark street or even a not so great neighborhood , the worst case scenario for me would be a mugging , it 's highly unlikely i 'd be murdered if i was n't looking for trouble and its even rarer for anything else to happen . 
  so when a man only wants to show how macho he is to his friends and yells after a woman on some poorly lit street , what do you think she is thinking about ? 
  do you think she is `` evaluating the safety of the area '' and processing the statistical chances that she will be raped and killed ? 
  * no * , she 'll be afraid - then she can go home and say `` man it really sucks to fear for your life on your own streets . . '' and someone comes along and says `` well , you know , actually . . there is only a x % chance for you to be sexually assaulted so your feelings are really just arbitrary , be logical ! '', 
  . . yeah . . that helps . 
  ps : referring to women 's fears of rape and assault as dryly as `` gathering the required information '' says a lot about how poorly you understand their perspective . 
  i know turks are n't popular here nowadays , but i would n't equate them with other middle eastern or north african cultures , they really are n't the same and it would be silly to assume you wo n't be facing different challenges integrating different groups of people . 
  totalitarian regimes are notorious for under-reporting crime . 
  have n't lived through it myself but here there were barely a few hours of tv a day and it was almost always all positive . 
  there was no `` 24 hour news cycle '' where you 'd hear about every stabbing , shooting , car accident and assault and then assume you 're stepping out into a warzone whenever you go outside . 
  people with similar opinions gather in the same place , it 's a human thing , also by design . 
  ideally what you should try to do is to understand why each group believes what they believe and how they got to those conclusions , then try to figure out which of them mesh best with the reality of where you live . 
  r/the _ donald is as much an echo chamber as / r/hillaryclinton - i should know - i read them both daily during the election , it was great fun . 
  not all ( or even most ) of sexual assault is about attractiveness , just because you 'd only be interested in groping the hot ones does n't mean a rapist thinks that way too . 
  in fact , since we 're talking about germans anyway , you should read about what the soviets did when they entered prussia , you could 've been 15 or 70 , it did n't matter . 
  and most people in 19th century uk lived under similar if not * worse * conditions , but if i were to come along and say 19th century uk was n't a developed country i would be laughed at . 
  it 's one of if not the largest economies in the world , they build things on a ridiculous scale . 
  yes , hundreds of millions live in poverty , human rights are a joke and they 're experimenting with a nightmare-ish social media based totalitarian system that orwell could 've only dreamed of , but it would be really callous to compare them to african nations . 
  if i were being dramatic , i could even say that they might be dangerous to our way of life in the future and civilizations that ignored and laughed at the `` barbarians '' before were often in for rude awakenings . 
  about time you did , what the hell did they teach you in school ? 
  when those obsessed with politics get their hands on the history books and rewrite hundreds of years of deeply intertwined history between russia and eastern/central europe , i would wager . 
  itt : people with 21st century political and ethnic grievances pretending that no really russia and uk are totes not part of europe and all that other nonsense over hundreds of years of history did n't mean anything at all . 
   oh wait is it because they 're allowing thousands of illegals to stream through their borders to flood europe ? 
  i know they might all look the same to you , but you 're really after the wrong brown people . 
  iran is shia - there are no shia attacks in europe , nor are iranians leaving their country as refugees to come here . 
  china is a highly developed country as well , that they do n't share our values does n't mean it is n't true . 
   travelling rumanian criminal gangs are actually a thing i learned from my fellows on / r/europe that if the bad guys are of a different ethnic group you can just refer to them with quotation marks . 
  `` romanians '' . 
  in most places in europe seeing police armed to the teeth patrolling around is a break from the norm . 
  as creatures of habit , such breaks would make anyone feel at least a little uncomfortable , even people who you might otherwise consider rational . 
  i know i 'd be weirded out if the bucharest subway i use every day would suddenly be patrolled by police with guns rather than the 3 ~ half asleep , unarmed private security guards that usually lounge about , especially since i can probably count the number of times i 've seen guns in person just using my two hands . 
   i do n't even now what pizzagate it 's a satanic pedophile cult run by hillary clinton and her aides out of the basement of a pizza shop . 
  if you 're not into the kid-stuff but dig satan , i hear the `` worship satan '' only days are on tuesdays . 
  a [ brave patriot ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/12/04/d-c-police-respond-to-report-of-a-man-with-a-gun-at-comet-ping-pong-restaurant/?utm_term=.0e3d7db7b065 ) tried to destroy the cult but upon arriving on the scene found that the pizzeria had no basement ( obviously a satanic illusion ) . 
  he was apprehended by strange , blue satyrs and never heard from again . 
  his * coat * was handed to his wife in a special ceremony . 
   chemtrails this one is a bit older , but no less sinister !, 
  you know all those condensation trails aircraft leave behind ? 
  well , they 're actually dropping chemicals on everyone in order to . . [ fill in the blank - personal suspicion : preparing the atmosphere to be habitable for the lizard people under l.a ] in all seriousness , the real reason you might be feeling that most people are `` looking at you weird '' is because ** the average person does n't care about this stuff ** - not everyone is a consumer of political discourse , left or right . 
  most people , when you start telling them your shtick instead of just letting them enjoy their beer/do their work/etc , will scream internally `` oh god not this shit again '' and this might be perceived as `` looking at me strangely ! '', 
  from someone who expects everyone to have some robust ( and preferably similar to theirs ) opinion on these things that ultimately do n't affect their day-to-day lives . 
  why do you believe that the population growth trends of various ethnic groups will remain unchanged over 200 ( ! ), 
  years ? 
  the societies and technologies of 2200 are likely to be almost as foreign and alien to us as the 2000s would be to someone from 1800 . 
  20 years ago you would n't be saying something like this as the society was totally different , i certainly doubt any prediction you 'd have made back then would 've been close to our reality today either , and now in 2017 you presume to know how things will be not in 20 more years but in 200 . 
  bollocks . 
   it 's not how europe was . 
  those times are over , these new kind of people are now a part of society and they 're here to stay . 
  and if they do n't integrate then this will be a permanent change . 
  as of now , there is no known way to integrate them . 
  so why discuss all of this , as if it was just a temporary thing that will pass in a few years ? 
  why would they though ? 
  they 're not wanted here , and , ostensibly , most of them do n't really like it here either . . and the more incidents like this and attacks happen ( and they both will again ) , the more the once polite , mild-mannered people of europe will despise them and vote in those who promise to get rid of them one way or another . 
  it does n't have to happen this election cycle , it can happen the next one , after isis in syria/iraq has been defeated and all the angry survivors and sympathizers will seek revenge . 
  fast forward 5 more years and something like a dozen more big attacks and i wonder how european electorates will react . 
  so really , it would probably be in the favour of most of them to return to their countries and rebuild them in whatever image they want once the current conflict is over . 
  on the other hand , maybe it 's your guys fault that you have n't had the foresight to be a poor and unattractive destination . 
  we 've been planning this for decades . 
  romania . . stronk ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned the most worrying statistic is that 112,214 people searched for ** boris johnson ** . 
  if he does n't hold ghal maraz how do we know he 's sigmar ? 
  i do n't trust this man , the agents of chaos are everywhere , stay vigilant !, 
  try it out in your professional life and let us know how it worked out for you . 
  if the region would 've still been part of greece would you still be saying this ? 
  only trying to catch up with you guys . 
  give us some time , we 're slower to change . 
  i know right ? 
  it 's obviously strawberry pickers . 
  disappoint . 
  probably was n't the best link to exemplify it , but i 'm assuming that what he 's getting at was that party officials and especially hitler himself would routinely remove capable commanders for political reasons or for simply not liking them . 
  ah , well , the solution is simple - whenever we see a story about gypsy-related crime , we 'll just all come into the threads and put just say `` romanians '' like all the westerners do when * their * ethnic minorities do something bad - i 'm sure everyone will agree !, 
  considering his name , i 'm assuming it 's a joke . 
  the decision to switch sides only resulted in fewer deaths and maybe ( but now we 're going into speculation ) more lenient treatment from the soviets - considering how we were treated anyway , you can imagine what could 've happened if it was a bitter campaign all through the carpathians . 
  i guess if he 's a rabid nationalist he could invoke `` honour '' or something like that but i 'll take extra hundreds of thousands of our guys not being dead instead , thanks . 
  compromise : glorious [ reincarnation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire ) into the 3rd vlacho-bulgarian empire . 
  we pitch in transylvania and then we can restore constantinopole together . 
  yup , i 'll enjoy the world where brown people do n't get beaten up just because they happened to be running away from the place an attack happened . . ( * you know , like everyone else * ) thankfully those men with brains and balls have enough of the former to not behave as savagely as you would want them to . 
  have never been religious , used to think people that were religious were less intelligent . . ** when i was a teenager ** . 
  this is only a thing you tell yourself to feel better and superior , you 'll get over it when you stop caring so much what others think about you . 
  seems perfectly reasonable to beat and torture suspects that you barely even have circumstantial evidence about . 
  all hail our civilized societies !, 
  human right 's abuses !, 
  hindsight is 20/20 . . in nazi germany gobbels was n't this dark or evil figure , he was a highly respected party official , a model of how `` proper '' germans should be . 
  does this sound like [ anyone else ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1133558/images/o-putin-horse-facebook.jpg ) you might have [ heard about ] ( http://www.mrctv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/monica/may/screen%20shot%202016-05-26%20at%2011.34.48%20am.png ) ? 
  it 's actually funny seeing people be so vehemently against these paper pushers in the nazi administration but finding excuses for all sorts of leaders that are in power ** today ** and who would be just as awful given the chance . 
  when moscow or washington kills innocents it 's just ` collateral damage ' and you 're ok with it because of the extremists that might be among them . 
  you have no problem waving away the thousands of innocent dead muslims because they `` probably have extremist beliefs anyway / x % of them support suicide bombing '' etc - while unironically looking down on all the citizens of 1930s germany who also vaguely disliked an entire ethnicity ` for reasons ' . 
  when that asshole in the philippines has his modern-day einsatzgruppen mow people down in the streets , some of you might tacitly approve it `` cos they 're doing it to criminals and those who destabilize our society anyway , good citizens have nothing to fear ! '' . 
  but what the germans did in the 40s ? 
  that 's bad , it was totes different though , really !, 
  the more you dehumanize the average nazi party supporter and the more you wave them away as racists and devils rather than ordinary humans , the more susceptible you are to just accepting whatever those in power tell you , because they 're on `` your side '' , and since its ` your side ' , it ca n't possibly be evil - no one * thinks * they 're evil . 
  the ordinary people in the 3rd reich felt just as justified and righteous when they thought about the jews as the many posts i see here explaining how all muslims are evil . 
  or whenever the subject of allied bombing campaigns in germany come up there are ** always ** people posting with an almost fetishistic glee at how much all the women and children in these cities `` had it coming '' - oh yeah buddy , you and the nazis are ** so ** different . 
  when you 're aware of your own biases and faults , you stand a better chance to control them . 
  if all you do is point them out in others , you 'll just be easier to manipulate , just like the ordinary nazi .
