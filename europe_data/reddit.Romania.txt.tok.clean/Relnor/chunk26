  thinking it 's only a thing women do and that men are beings of superior moral character ( lol ... ) is so ridiculous and so far on the extreme end of / r/redpill that i 'm frankly surprised the replies were as civil as they were . 
  this bullshit about an `` islamized west '' was repeated often enough as a joke that people actually started believing it ? 
  the protest was an emotional knee-jerk reaction type deal to the club fire and the corruption/negligence that lead to it . 
  romanians ( and tbh just people in general ) are n't good at thinking in the long term or of thinking about policies . 
  they do n't have a long `` political memory '' . 
  and it 's not even about being stupid as most people will tell you - it 's simply about being busy with other things in life and not having time to understand all the details in such complex issues . 
  so when you 're living in some small town , you 're relatively uneducated ( this does * not * have to mean you 're stupid ) and you 're busy working 8 + hours a day for a minimum wage job , your opinions wo n't be the most informed , and someone promising you a better life will be tempting . 
  have said it before , interest groups and powerful people in the us will not allow trump to undo decades of foreign policy just because he thinks it 's a good idea . 
  his powers are not only * not * unlimited , but plenty of people in his cabinet ( check out all those bush-era types he 's bringing in ) will influence him in the `` right '' direction - presidents are n't omnipotent , the people around them have a significant hand in shaping what decisions they * think * they can take . 
  perhaps we can convince germany to send us a prince . 
  maybe it will work a second time ~, 
  while psd is a corrupt party with a lot of problems ( * and it 's not the only one by the way * ) , using cartoonish descriptions such as `` forces of evil '' and `` forces of good '' is just ... it shows a deep lack of understanding , imo . 
  to elaborate a bit : pnl are certainly under no definition the `` forces of good '' - the mere thought of that is silly . 
  i know political memory is short , so i will remind you that today 's pnl is a fusion of the old pnl and of pdl , the previous president 's party who was every bit as bad as psd . 
  could you say they 're the lesser evil ? 
  maybe . . ? 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  then you have usr - their members are all new to politics , that 's refreshing , it 's promising . 
  they seem to have a generally liberal agenda without straying into the insanity that has befallen others in the west , so it 's all good . 
  but they were never going to win a large % , not this time at least . 
  do remember that this formation only exists since february this year , so getting into parliament at all was a feat in of itself . 
  it would 've been interesting to have them be tested in government , see what they 'd actually do ( since talk is cheap ) , but it was unlikely to happen this time . 
   all romanians on this sub have a chip on their shoulder . 
  we only strive to emulate the best . 
  do n't think about it too much . 
  political ideology in romania is n't really a thing . 
  you should instead be thinking about each party as an interest group/gang/clan and the fancy political affiliations are just something we heard about from the west and we 're paying lip service to it . 
  sure it 's easy , but my point was - he was talking about their raison d'etre - i did n't `` identify '' as an atheist , it was just something i would n't think about and was n't part of my life , at all . 
  today i 'll freely tell anyone i think it 's all fairy tales ( but it 's cool to believe in them if it does n't hurt anyone and comforts you !, 
  ) , but being an `` atheist '' is n't how i 'd describe myself or present myself to someone , or something i even think about all the time . 
  i would n't be ` pissed ' if religions would suddenly vanish , since at least in my personal life it would n't make any real difference . 
  it 's silly to talk about the reason for existing of something like atheism : if all religions would be gone , would everyone be atheist or would atheism be gone too ? 
  does n't make much sense when you think about it . 
  my family was n't religious or at least did n't practice it or talked about it . 
  until i was older and thought about these things myself ( and came to the conclusion that they 're fairy tales ) , it just was n't a thing i would think about . 
  was i an atheist then ? 
  or just a person who did n't care/think about religion ? 
  any tldr on what the referendum was actually about ? 
  i read a guardian article , but they were very vague about the `` reforms '' . 
  terrorism is big , flashy and ( relatively ) easy for everyone to understand . 
  it 's fairly rare and the media covers it obsessively . 
  other issues such as social inequality or financial corruption are just really complex issues that you 'd need to spend a good amount of time to fully grasp , and most people do n't have the time or inclination to do so . 
  this is the same reason politicians like to talk rhetoric and repeat catchy phrases instead of focusing on more complicated issues . 
  tldr : we suck . 
  it 's worth keeping in mind that you 're only considered unemployed while on unemployment benefit , which you only get for a limited number of months while you look for a job . 
  once that stops coming in , you 're not counted anymore , even if you 're still unemployed . 
  your own hatred for this minority is very transparent when you try to troll like this . 
  you 're right . 
  you should watch out for those isis training camps in alabama too . 
  i hear they 're about to impose sharia law over there as well . 
  well , obviously . 
  the 1935 picture is how the city looked before it was bombed in 1940 , the 1942 picture is what was left after all the debris was cleared . 
  the british are coming !, 
  why is it that whenever someone mentions something bad that ** one white guy ** did , someone like you comes out and says `` hating white people huh !? '' . 
  on the other hand if i said `` muslims are ** all ** violent and incompatible with our society '' , i 'd probably get all of your upvotes . 
  stop comparing all criticism of someone who is white to what a very very small minority of extreme left-wing nutjobs say . 
  you will never have a useful conversation if you just bring out the race card ( which ironically right wingers say they hate ) every time . 
  jihadists ( who by the way , while mostly brown , come in all colours ) are enemies of life . 
  anders breivik and thomas mair are also enemies of life . 
  they are all terrorists , they are all scum . 
  the only difference between them is following different ideologies . 
   and now , with the forthcoming withdrawal of the usa from the agreement , and the possible negative momentum it will bring to the paris agreement , i think it is safe to say we may well be headed toward a worst-case scenario . 
  in case you have n't seen it , trump already backpedalled on his vow to withdraw and claims he is `` keeping an open mind '' and that there is probably `` some connection '' between climate change and human behaviour . 
  it 's pretty clear someone educated him during one of the briefings since he won . 
  probably wo n't help much and we 're already fucked anyway , but hey . 
  have to wonder , if i 'm white and speak the local language without a funny accent , would anyone even think twice if i told them that no really my family has been living there for many generations ? 
  he did n't specifically say `` we should kill them all in concentration camps '' , but it was n't exactly ambiguous either - he was very clear in his belief that they were a mortal danger to the german nation . 
  which begs the question : how * do * you deal with mortal dangers ? 
  also worth keeping in mind this was the 20s-30s , so * mortal dangers * were n't dealt with through dialogue , therapy , and political correctness . 
  that said , the comparisons to trump are tenuous at best , not only is the political landscape vastly different , but beyond superficial similarities they 're pretty different characters too . 
  it 's all moot anyway since i might be wrong here but i think the people around the president collectively have more real power than the president himself ( not by law obviously but by influence ) and * those * are who i 'd be concerned about . 
  he did write everything he was going to do in great detail in that book of his while he was in prison ~, 
  as far as i 'm concerned this is the biggest issue with a trump presidency , the rest is peanuts compared . 
  supreme court decisions such as rights for gay marriage ca n't , as far as i know , be overturned without a majority of the states agreeing to it . 
  gay marriage across all states is n't going anywhere . 
  the wall will never be built , at least not the version he promised , the border is just too long , this is n't like israel 's walls , the us-mexico border is 3200 km . 
  he wo n't deport millions of illegals , not in any good time at least , it 's just too big of an undertaking . 
  i 'm not saying he ca n't do other harm , there are plenty of bad things he can do , but it all pales in comparison to the harm he can do by ignoring climate change . 
  any regression of social rights is unfortunate , but you can come back from that , climate change , not so much . 
  i can only hope that now that he 's president elect they put him in a room with a whole bunch of scientists and they all explained to him in detail why climate change is n't bullshit , and that he 'll listen . 
  do the trains still run on time too ? 
  and a trick like that is * exactly * what would drive all these trump supporters into a frenzy . 
  you know what that would look like ? 
  it would look as if the d.c elites once again got their way and gave the win to the candidate * they * wanted . 
  all of the ( in many ways legitimate ) built up anger that caused these people to vote for a populist demagogue like trump would then have to be released in another way other than through the democratic process , and that is a scary thought . 
  4 years from now the trump presidency will probably be mediocre at best and a hilarious mess at worst , i really doubt he 'd win reelection but that also depends on the conduct of the democrats during that election cycle , this time they were awful , and they got what they deserved . 
  as much as i do n't like him ( although i * was * laughing in the dem establishment 's face as he got elected ) , peaceful transfer of power ** has ** to happen . 
  yes , you could argue that it 's undemocratic that he lost the popular vote and still got elected , but you do n't change the rules of the game after it has already been played . 
  also if they somehow overturn the results , many of his desperate , well armed supporters with nothing left to lose other than minimum wage jobs will make the current riots look like nothing . 
  i do n't usually like the words `` civil war '' being thrown around , but this would be a time when i 'd say `` could happen . . '' . 
  how is romania part of the ` balkans ' and greece is n't ? 
  if anything , romania should be blue . 
  we 're * culturally similar * in some respects to the people of the balkans and have some significant historical connections but the balkan peninsula ends at the danube . 
  on the other hand you have former yugoslav states in yellow instead , wut . 
  oh and , i know you do n't like them , but can we cut the bs on russians not being european ? 
  they look like us , they speak an indo-european language and their culture and history are deeply intertwined with that of europe over many centuries . 
  this is as silly as other people i 've heard saying the uk is n't european . 
  i mean shit , you even included eastern thrace ( so turkey basically ) as part of europe but not kaliningrad . 
  you must hate them extra much . 
  * progressive * ?
