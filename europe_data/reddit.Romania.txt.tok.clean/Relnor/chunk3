  this is a shitty situation . 
  the last thing you ever want to hear is that someone has authorized the use of weapons , against anyone , really . 
  i know it 's unpopular to hear , but the migrants are humans like the rest of us too and the fact that some people in this thread are rubbing their hands at the thought of blood being shed is disgusting . 
   muh age i did n't necesarily want to presume that he 's younger than me ( tho it maybe came out that way ) - maybe he 's in fact older , but this sort of attitude is what i 've normally associated with the younger sort . 
  i had very militant anti-theistic opinions when i was a teen too - i 'm still an atheist , but my opinions have nuanced somewhat . 
  funny that you would say that , a lot of germans integrated very well into roman armies and fought with them from gaul to the middle east . 
  i know the point you 're trying to make , but there are subtle differences between the 300 to 800 ad migration and what is happening in 2015 . 
  well heavens fucking forbid anyone cares for the well beign of anyone else . 
  jobbik is a fascist party , it 's not even a matter of degrees - they do n't try to hide it , it 's pretty open - in the way they rally and in the things they say . 
  if you did n't vote for them , that 's great , if you did , at least own up to what you are , the way this subreddit is looking , you might have a lot of friends to back you up . 
  as long as their methods do n't involve severely abusing or murdering any of the refugees , i do n't think anyone sane would have a problem . 
  besides , these people do n't want to stop in hungary , germany is offering to take the lion 's share of the lot , all hungary has to do is have the refugees cross their country in a safe and orderly manner , i 'm pretty sure none of them want to stay , they 're obviously not welcome . 
  i wish people would pay more attention to what i 'm saying - i said that deploying the army ( especially with non-lethal weapons , as seems to be the case ) can turn out to be effective and even more conducive to peace and make the refugees even safer than they currently are . 
  ofcourse , apperantly raising even a slight question of concern for the lives of these people on a subreddit that 's ostensibly for the civilized part of the world seems to be very unpopular , 
  to be fair , that 's whats going on right now , dial back 6 months and we were talking about russia instead . 
  they rioted , hopefully bringing the army in will calm them down . 
  as someone else said , people behave differently to blue uniformed policemen than they do to gun-toting soldiers in fatigues . 
  also , i know this might be an unpopular opinion : but when our own citizens riot , we do n't murder them , so i can only hope we afford the same treatment to the `` invaders '' . 
  metaphors are not exempt from critique - the intent was pretty clear : these are bad people , they 're ** invading ** us . 
  anyway , i still find it funny that i get downvoted because i call for more reasonable discourse instead of `` we 're over here , they 're over there - they 're bad , we 're good . 
  fuck them all . '' . 
  i guess if i would have said i hope some of the crowd is weeded out with bullets i would 've been showered in upvotes . 
  i have serious doubts any of these people would attack armed soldiers . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying hungarian soldiers would be ordered to fire on the crowd - hungary might have problems with their democracy , but i do n't think they 'd go down that path . 
  but i can easily see a confusing , rapidly changing situation leading to someone getting shot - especially if the heads of the guys with guns are filled with `` these are dangerous dudes that are n't like you '' rhetoric that groups like jobbik like to put out . 
  we will see - i should remind you that a neo-fascist party won 20 % of the vote in hungary . 
  what happens if some of their rhetoric influences the soldiers on the ground ? 
  seems like a volatile situation to me . 
  i suppose i can only hope some of the cooler heads in hungary prevail . 
   thats because it is an invasion no it 's not - it 's dangerous hyperbole . 
  these people , whether they 're refugees or economic migrants , are trying to find a better place to live , they 're not here to pillage , they 're not here to kill you . 
  now you can argue about whether they should be allowed in or about how the situation should be handled , but the ** words ** you use are important - invasion comes with a certain stigma and baggage that poisons the discussion from the get-go . 
  i mean , shit , if they 're invaders , we should just shoot them all , right ? 
  again , regardless of which side you 're taking on the crisis , nuance and the meaning of your words is crucial , this is not black & white shit we 're talking about here . 
  i suppose it 's because most of those methods would require help - and a lot of societies are rabidly against assisted suicide , largely because it reminds them of their own mortality . 
  ofcourse , i do n't actually approve , but forcing someone who wants to go to stay feels cruel at best . 
  and why guns ? 
  i guess it 's fairly expedient , and painless ( unless it does n't kill you , in which case , shit . ), 
  - i do n't think anyone in that state quite cares about the mess they leave for the janitor . 
  because the death would be a result of his government 's choice to deploy the army and the quite frankly xenophobic stance he 's taken for long before this crisis showed up at our doorstep . 
  it 's certainly what i would expect from a western official , and i 'd like to assume that we here in eastern europe can be held up to the same standards . 
  as i said though , we can only hope there will be no such escalation , and the army will instead calm the situation rather than make it worse . 
   a damn invasion language and nuance is important - calling this an `` invasion '' is portraying them as an adversary or something to be feared and resented - which is hardly the case . 
  it 's a dangerous way of representing these people . 
  also , i do n't think we should hold up what nations outside of europe would do as something to aspire to . 
  that said , hungary may have some success in using it 's army to ** contain and prevent violence , not to cause it ** . 
  if the hungarians can use their military to prevent the refugees from rioting and ultimately hurting themselves , that can only be a good thing . 
  on the other hand , if anyone is killed by a hungarian soldier , then surely mr.orban will do the right thing and resign ? 
  right ? 
  right guys ? 
  edit : woo , the downvotes are fun . 
  sorry guys , you 're right . 
  mass graves it is . 
  i 'm in bucharest . 
  no one wants to come here . 
  everything you 're saying makes perfectly good sense , but i think you 're underestimating just how dangerous iraq can be - i do n't know a lot about 80s new york , but i 'd wager today 's iraq is more dangerous than that . 
  maybe these guys are less fearful for their lives and i 'm just a big coward , but i 'd take a shitty and probably temporary life in a very safe place like finland instead of fearing for my life pretty much every day in iraq . 
  just the peace of mind that there is n't a chance i 'm going to be blown up on my way to work on any given day would do wonders for me . 
  which is why i can understand why some of the other europeans here are n't very sympathetic about these guys complaining . 
   it 's lame to lie about matters like this , immoral i would say . 
  when i was a teen ( which was n't so long ago ) i was very martial and black & white about a lot of things too - while i ca n't say i 'm 100 % ashamed of anything i used to think , i 've found my opinions have been more chiseled and i 've become more understanding with time - i hope it happens to you too . 
  lol has also taught me `` ja pierdole '' - where 's my degree ? 
  i guess someone who has been coddled in a safe , western european state and most likely has never so much as heard a gunshot or had a finger lifted against them knows all about bravery and cowardice . 
  by the way , before you spin the arguement around on me : yes , i am also coddled and have never been truly threatened and always safe , but i do n't pretend and ** i do n't call people who risk death every day cowards ** for wanting to get away from that . 
  but hey , i guess being brave in vidya games is a good enough substitute . 
  going to bite , although i smell a troll : it 's pretty rich talking about europeans hating `` brown people '' while you 're across the pond in the us - how is the weekly beating/murder of blacks by us cops working out ? 
  or gop frontrunner `` the donald '' and his plan to build a giant wall on the mexican border ? 
  or maybe we 'd like to talk about his even more insane buddy ( although in all honesty is anyone more insane than trump ? 
  ) , scott walker - who proposed a ** canadian border wall ** - presumably to keep all those terrible moose people out who just ca n't wait to immigrate to a worse country than theirs . 
  oh , wait , what 's that ? 
  you do n't like the republicans ? 
  well tough shit . 
  i guess when someone generalizes about the place you 're from , they can paint you in a pretty bad light too . 
   so all the civil wars , ethnic strife , the rise of isis - you 're placing all of that at europe and america 's feet ? 
  all of it ? 
  not at all . 
  a good share of it ? 
  absolutely . 
  european powers creating artificial states after ww1 , with no regards for ethnic lines or anything local whatsoever , created abominations like iraq - where sunni and shia muslims can murder eachother in perpetuity . 
  you talk about idealistic nonsense - but what about the arab spring ? 
  remember that ? 
  remember how western powers pushed for the removal of all these secular dictators in the middle east ? 
  this is the result : trying to impose western values on these people , either through invasions ( iraq , afghanistan ) or through bombing ( libya , syria ) has failed - we 've toppled or tried to topple their ( admittedly terrible ) governments and allowed religious fundamentalists to take their place . 
  make no mistake , the middle east may have been a shithole 20 years ago - but it 's an even bigger shithole now , thanks in no small part to the bumbling intervention of bush & co. . you know it is a sad day when you wish people that gas children like saddam and al assad stay in charge instead of the maniacs that took advantage of the chaos we left in our wake . 
  and who 's burden do you think it will be ? 
  the rich arab states ? 
  that 's great . 
  i agree . 
  they should help - a few million dollars would be nothing to them , and would go a long way towards solving the problem - but they never will , because as i 've said , they have a very tribal outlook . 
  i could go on about something like how its then up to the civilised world to stand up for the values it upholds - but that 's ` idealistic nonsense ' - so i 'll just say this : they 're here by the truckloads now , what was once only a `` middle eastern problem '' is a european problem now , and as convinient as it would be , saying `` pack up and go home ragheads '' wo n't solve the problem . 
  i 'm romanian . 
  no guilt tripping here . 
  still , building a big wall and saying `` well it 's not our problem '' is not a solution - how many times in history have big walls actually worked out ? 
  while everyone would rather all these people be back in their countries , they 're here now , and sticking our head in the sand is not a solution . 
  ofcourse germany ca n't take them all . 
  europe ca n't take them all - we need a solution for their own countries . 
  ofcourse , without the help of rich actors in the middle east ( saudis , emirates , the lot ) , there will never be a permanent solution . 
  and with the tribal culture present in those places , they will never help - the rich arab states have not lifted a finger to help these refugees , they would rather take advantage of the chaos and try to dominate those regions , directly or by proxy . 
  naturally , it 's not very pc to say that these guys have a tribal mindset and have been slaughtering eachother in a religious conflict for over 1000 years . 
  but hey , it 's easier to just make nazi analogies .
