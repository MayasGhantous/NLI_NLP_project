  for all the stumbling and the giant mess that this crisis is , at least europe is trying to do ** something ** - while the powers in the middle east are grinning from the sidelines . 
  that 's pretty simple : germany is a rich country , if you 'd be one of them and trying to get the best shot possible at a better life , would you stop in greece , a country with severe economic problems - or hungary , one of the most xenophobic countries in europe - or would you move to germany or sweden , who are rich and have big welfare states ? 
  not going to argue if what they 're doing is good/bad/right / wrong , but the reasons why they 'd want to go there are pretty clear . 
  ofcourse it has n't . 
  the saudis might be a state in the modern sense , but they 're still very much tribal - they would rather dominate these territories than help them . 
  lets not even get into the whole shia vs sunni clusterfuck and how that affects the way they behave . 
  cute analogy . 
  but how do you propose to help the hundreds of thousands of refugees crossing into europe ? 
  mostly right , except hungary 's only solution to the problem is to build a big wall and stop anyone from getting in . 
  not only does it not work , but it 's not a solution either . 
  people like to laugh at trump 's proposal of building a wall on the mexican border ( and rightfully so ) yet they seem to appreciate what the dangerously undemocratic hungarian state is doing , which seems pretty strange . 
  no one really wants to take all these people in - but they are here , and something has to be done about them . 
  building a wall and blowing rasberries at them from on top of it wo n't make them magically go away . 
  more importantly , something has to be done to fix their homes ( homes which , by the way , are in the state that they because of europe and the usa , ultimately ) - so they can return there . 
  how do we do that though ? 
  more bombs ? 
  we 've been doing that . 
  boots on the ground ? 
  tried that for the last decade or so , did n't work . 
  imo the only real , long term solution is an intervention by the rich arab states in the area ( emirates , saudis , etc ) - but they will never intervene in good faith because of the tribal way in which they see the region . 
  in fewer words , the middle east is severely fucked and will probably remain severely fucked for a long time , and while we do n't want these refugees/immigrants , it 's hard to fault them for wanting to leave . 
  stupid statements get stupid answers . 
  get out of hand how ? 
  what will they do ? 
  will the handful of chinese police officers take over a country in the heart of europe and . . do . . what ? 
  maybe you do n't know , but having a few liaisons from countries that provide a lot of your tourists/immigrants is common practice everywhere in europe . 
  we have a few officers in paris , rome and a few other places too , but you wo n't be seeing the romanian flag above the eiffel tower anytime soon . 
  movie props !, 
  nothing to worry about . 
  move along komrads . 
  actually he is right about internet speeds . 
  our internet in bucharest and other important cities matches or exceeds the average speed of much more developed countries . 
  just look at the steam metrics for instance : http://store.steampowered.com/stats/content/ maybe not the ** best ** measurement , but they are interesting - rcs & rds is the most popular and widespread one . 
  on the other hand ... in 2015 , ** 30 % ** of romanians still had their wc outside their homes and i suspect this has n't changed by a lot . 
  i 'm not talking remote mountain villages , but even some poorer homes only a few kms away from the capital . 
  soooo . . there are pros and cons i guess o /, 
  disappointed . 
  i thought we were the pesky dutch art thieves . 
  one upped again . 
  when will we ever shine =(, 
  how is a 20 year old in elected office ? 
  a 20 year old knows nothing about anything . 
  i 'm almost 25 and i know even less than that . 
  please , no . 
  you 're obviously the pictured baby eater and are just angry that your secret is exposed . 
  well . 
  said europeans are obviously lightweight loser babies . 
  oligarchs need to eat too . 
  the eu will wag it 's finger very strongly at the naughty dictator and then leave him be because realpolitik is n't fueled by feelings or human rights issues . 
  far right wingers sink quicker with that religion boulder tied around their necks , while i 'm still floating , you 're at the bottom of the lake already . 
  what 's this ?!, 
  a white cissy ** male ** in a position of power oppressing a beautiful multi-gendered member of the lgbtq ~ ~ master race ~ ~ community ?!, 
  i hope she demands full compensation for this and that he receives it , in full , from the offender himself !, 
  she should n't have to suffer such ~ ~ minor annoyances ~ ~ cruel oppression from those chained so tightly to gender norms !, 
  he should become the headteacher instead and teach the upcoming generation about her plight so that , in the future , his kin will never have to suffer like she has . 
  also , i see ** so ** much mansplaining in this thread . 
  makes . 
  sick . 
  i suppose it depends if you 're the sort that can find amusement in everything burning to the ground or not . 
  if you are n't , then i get it , it becomes super frustrating . 
  if your financial situation is stable , there is no better place than romania . 
  you need only turn the tv onto some news and you will find an almost endless supply of farcical events perpetrated by the `` leadership '' . 
  as long as they do n't directly affect you and you can be detached - it 's awesome !, 
  are you favoring one political party or the other , and you think i 'm talking about your favorite ? 
  well , worry not !, 
  - all - of them provide unlimited entertainment , no matter who is in power at what time , fun for everyone !, 
  o / in all seriousness , i feel a lot of younger romanians have been disenfranchised - i grew up ( born 1991 ) thinking everything that is romanian is bad and that the west is this magical place of wonder and awesomeness that can do no wrong . 
  the generation before mine lived under communism and they were `` waiting for the americans to come '' so they transferred this magical view of the west to many of their children . 
  today ? 
  we see that the west , while in many ways still better than us , is not the land of fairies that have it all figured out which we thought it was . 
  while i still deeply roll my eyes at fervent nationalist types , perhaps as this realization sinks in , people in eastern europe will look more towards improving their own countries instead of moving en-masse to the ` promised land ' . 
  if pravda says so , it must be true !, 
  no naples ? 
  london on the ** 15th ** place ? 
  really ? 
  latvia should be careful . 
  tanks do n't need visas . 
  edit : people sure took my comment seriously . 
  impressive . 
  the purple phoenix rises !, 
  nope . 
  more satire videos please . 
  without knowing a lot about turkey , i 'd suspect that the youth ( especially those living on the european side of the country , like izmir & surroundings ) are more modern and the further into anatolia you go , the worst it gets usually . 
  that 's nothing new though , go to some village in transylvania or moldova where they still use outhouses and do n't have indoor plumbing and electricity and ask them about their world view , do n't expect it to be very cosmopolitan . 
  you sure about that ? 
  all i have to do is google image `` charlie hebdo jews '' and i see quite a few covers making fun of them . 
  also i know short , definitive statements are all the rage , but are you ** sure ** they stand for free speech as much as isis ? 
  you know , isis ? 
  the guys who ** chop off your head if you disagree with them ** ? 
  or do you just have a bone to pick with this publication ? 
  if they get shot up again , the survivors will probably make their own cover about the attack . 
  no counter narrative , no ideological victory . 
  muslims that want to see their religion coexist peacefully with western values ( and let 's not pretend that is n't possible , middle ages christianity was no better and it could change , so can islam ) need to ** actively ** create a narrative that goes against islamism . 
  they have failed to do that so far , formal declarations of `` guys this is bad '' after terrorist strikes is not enough , moderate imams and muslims in positions of authority need a concentrated campaign against islamists and jihadists . 
  these guys with authority need to tell the disenfranchised youth `` no , this is the wrong way '' . 
  you can bomb the middle east until there 's nothing left , but without a counter ideology you will never kill the idea . 
  this kind of legislation needs to become a reality in every european country , christianity used to be barbaric too and it was dragged kicking and screaming into the modern age . 
  it 's islam 's turn . 
  ca n't wait for him to win . 
  seeing him try to run the country into the ground will be a delight .
