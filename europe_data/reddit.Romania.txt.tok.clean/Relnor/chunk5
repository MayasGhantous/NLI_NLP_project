  i 'm not even joking . 
  i want him to win for my entertainment , i 'm fucked up . 
  i know . 
  a lot of places in the united states are n't safe either . 
  far less safe than most places in europe . 
  for instance , i know that the chances of being shot dead by someone who has some grievance with me is almost entirely zero in bucharest . 
  we do n't have terrorism either ( because who wants to blow themselves up in romania , psh ) , but even if i were to pick a place like paris that saw two major attacks in a single year , i suspect you 'd be safer in paris than in a lot of american metropolises . 
  this is just fear-mongering , your chances of being killed in a terrorist strike are far smaller than those of dying shot by your paranoid neighbor - and your chances of dying in a car accident are even larger than those . 
  i do n't know a lot about him , so you might be right , was just the first `` traitor '' that came to mind . 
  my point was , looking down on all `` traitors '' is stupid . 
  if you 're betraying darth vader you 're not one of the bad guys , it does n't have to mean you 're automatically one of the good guys either , but this `` traitor is a traitor '' stuff is medieval nonsense . 
  after all , continuing with the nazi analogy , career officers were hanged at nuremberg for just ` following orders ' as the op thinks everyone should . 
  `` refugees will be made to live `` where we as the state see as appropriate , and not where the refugee sees as appropriate . '' '', 
  i do n't see the problem here , these people should understand that they are ** guests ** - and that germany ** does n't owe them anything ** , even more so as a country that has n't been deeply involved in messing up the middle east in the past . 
  if i were coming from a war-torn country , i would feel grateful simply to be in a place where i know my life is n't in danger at all times . 
  just that feeling of security would be enough , the rest is a bonus . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'm sure claus von stauffenberg and the other anti nazi plotters were some of the worst people to exist as well . 
  while i agree that there 's a constant push ( with malicious intent or not , that 's for the conspiracy theorists ) for more surveillance and control , do n't you think this is a bit dramatic ? 
   if muhammed were alive today which would he more likely be ? 
  where would he born ? 
  saudi arabia like he originally was ? 
  or indonesia ? 
  india ? 
  there are a lot of places where islam is a state religion or has a huge % of the population and they 're very different . 
  thing is , the place you 're born has a massive impact on your upbringing , life experience and education , it basically defines who you are . 
  each of these countries practice different forms of islam , in some cases drastically different . 
  i know this might be shocking , but most of them do n't export terrorists and do n't want to invade your country or spread to it . 
  so if muhammed would 've been born today in saudi arabia , he would have probably grown to be a deeply conservative sunni muslim following the poisonous , wahhabi form of islam that sa so loves to export to the western world and is responsible for pretty much all the terrorism with the exception of hezbollah who is shiite . 
  you are trying to pretend all muslims ( or a huge number of muslims ) are ** islamists ** which is not the same thing . 
  if i were to judge all christians based on how people in the american bible belt behave , wonder if i 'd get as many upvotes as you did for doing the same thing with muslims . 
  but hey , they 're the easy target . 
  ps : this is coming from an atheist who believes we 'd be better off without anyone believing in any of this made up crap at all . 
  honestly , i would convict the guy on the right for that horrific beard alone . 
  we live in the free part of the world where people can do whatever the fuck they want in their bedrooms . 
  i heard there 's these other places further to the east that are more like you want , but a lot of people seem to be running away from there , ca n't imagine why . 
   if you have sex , be prepared to have children . 
  no dodging responsibility for you . 
  how about no ? 
  why should people be forced to bring children into the world that they do n't want ( or ca n't take care of ) just because `` responsibility '' ? 
  so people are n't allowed to have sex other than for conception ? 
  are we in medieval europe again ? 
  i must 've missed the memo . 
  its ** absolutely ** only their business and any other argument is just conservative bullshit . 
  there is no `` baby '' when the morning after pill is taken . 
  whatever argument you could make when it comes to abortions falls completely flat now . 
  i 'd rather live in a world where people can be free to do as they want in their leisure time as long as both parties agree . 
  you seem to want a strict , depressing world where we are all worker drones and it 's all about `` responsibility '' and `` duty '' and the 9 to 5 . 
  fuck that . 
  this is n't an anti muslim post , it 's an anti islamist post , and everyone except the most die hard pc adepts and colonial guilt ridden types are or should be openly defiant of islamism whenever possible . 
  especially other muslims . 
  time to close it then , no questions asked . 
  it 's a nest of vipers in your midst . 
  close it , arrest/deport the imam and let the moderates form a new mosque where everyday muslims do n't get fed this poisonous , fascist ideology . 
  `` but relnor !, 
  that would be ever so beastly !, 
  someone might think we are racist then !, 
  [ we can only spout propaganda about people who are white enough !, 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4460636/ ) - like you !, 
  no sympathy for the smug self-satisfied idiot . 
  he 's obviously a shit person and if i were doing any sort of business with him i 'd have no qualms about giving him the middle finger and never dealing with him again . 
  that said , i would hope no charges stick to him over something like this , as much as i like to see puffed up muppets like this squirm , you ca n't arrest someone over a tweet like that or you 'd find enough reasons to arrest like half of the people who ever use twitter ( psa : twitter sucks for anything other than following noteworthy people with shows etc , do n't use twitter for discussion . 
  ever . ), 
  in the meanwhile twitter and facebook have hundreds of islamofascist accounts openly praising the way all of those people who were just minding their own business got plastered all over that terminal - the holders of these accounts ca n't all be abroad . 
  they found this `` man '' who was `` tough '' on that random woman , can they find the islamists too ? 
  do people in the uk really not know where the czech republic is on the map ? 
  is that how they got you at the munich agreement too ? 
  that ... that 's not how the language works . . 
  but hey , anything for perpetual offense . 
  when satire imitates reality so closely no one believes you 're joking . . \u1d40\u02b0\u1da6\u02e2 \u1da6\u02e2 \u02e2\u1d43\u1d57\u1da6\u02b3\u1d49 \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57, 
  yup , being groped by groups of strangers in a crowd and being tapped on your ass with a twig by your friends is ** absolutely ** the same kind of thing . 
  just no . 
  stop trying to use this excuse . 
  did the western powers fuck the middle east up after ww1 and created artificial countries ignoring ethnic and religious lines ? 
  yes , yes they did . 
  did a coalition of western countries lead by the us trample all over iraq and afghanistan for their own interests ? 
  yes , yes they did . 
  did we waltz into these countries controlled by secular dictators and turned them upside down chasing some fantasy of creating democracies and nation building ? 
  ( and in some places cynically cashing in on the results of the war ) - yes . 
  did we kill innocent people with our bombs ? 
  yes , yes we did . 
  was it out of greed and corporate interest with little thought for the locals ? 
  maybe not entirely , but it was certainly part of it . 
  however , you can not go all `` oh the poor victims that have been killing hundreds of civilians '' - are all muslims islamists ? 
  they 're not . 
  most of them are just trying to get by , like everyone else , they only want to be left alone and they hate these radicals who bring suspicion and animosity onto them . 
  but you can not - can not excuse the actions of islamofascists this way . 
  our actions , some of them were reprehensible , yes , but they are not an excuse . 
  in the early 1940s , nazi germany cynically murdered ** millions ** of jews - a genocide so heinous that it got it 's own special name - and not one jew - not a single jew has blown himself up in a german airport . 
  we can discuss our failures , we can learn from them , but we can not use them as excuses to turn these barbaric murderers into victims . 
  they are not victims . 
  they are purely evil . 
  make the distinction between muslims and islamists - it 's a super important distinction , the former are just people like everyone else , the latter are scum that are unrecoverable and need to be stamped out like bugs , physically and ideologically . 
  i 've ranted enough . 
  you 're right , she ** is ** 34 !, 
  never mind , i must have been drunk , i 'm only 25 . 
  uh , woo i guess ? 
  the reddit posters you mention are simply mentally ill ( sorry , no other way to put it ) and the bbc and guardian were simply regurgitating far leftist agenda which was far more popular at the time . 
  i 'd be interested in seeing how many people and publications would still write articles in that style following another attack in the us after what happened twice in paris and now in brussels . 
  i 'm still impressed that this lady is like 2 years younger than me and flies attack helicopters .
