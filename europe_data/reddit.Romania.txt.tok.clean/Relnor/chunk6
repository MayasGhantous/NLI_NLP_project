  the attackers will be identified eventually , i 'll be surprised if they were n't on some kind of watch list already , would n't be the first time . 
  amazing that this attack could still go through even with the height of alertness in belgium at this time . 
  just hearing on tv that le figaro reports gunshots as well . 
  sad . 
  i hope people keep a level head through this , we need decisive action and decisive change , but it must n't be dominated by irrational hatred either . 
  superpower under what definition ? 
  france was certainly one of the ** great powers ** . . if you deny that , i 'm either really sorry you were taught history so badly or you 're just trying to make some ww2 french surrender joke . 
  people who behead others ( even their corpses ) are obviously not fit to be part of our societies , even if the beheaded person was one of the bad guys . 
  any of this `` give this guy a medal '' crap is either pure trolling ( seems bout right judging by the poster 's name ) or uneducated barbarism just like isis . 
  sad to see this can happen in a european capital , even in it 's worst neighborhoods . 
  i think it 's awful that people can attack police officers or their vehicles with little to no reservations . 
  you know , i 'm super lib , i think what the police force in the usa are doing is downright criminal at times , but maybe western european police is too far in the other direction , there ** should ** be some level respect for authorities . 
  no , you should n't be shot dead for vandalism of a police car but you should n't think `` lol no problem the consequences are minimal '' either . 
   long trips in big groups are dangerous . 
  you 're right . 
  none of us should ever go anywhere . 
  away !, 
  away with your logic and rule of law !, 
  kill the raghuds !, 
  wrauagghh < foams , 
  we have scorching summers and arctic winters , if you want temperate weather i 'd recommend something like the benelux countries tbh . 
  constantinopole is not in europe . 
  til . 
  ps : get a grip . 
  what ? 
  no no no no no . 
  you can not teach people about everything in the educational system . 
  there is no time . 
  i 'm not going to pretend the romanian educational system is good , but in our history classes , we mostly dealt with national history and large events ( ie - world wars ) that directly affected romania , i suspect this is true of the history classes of a lot of countries . 
  now if the op would have been portuguese , i 'd get why it would be sad , but he 's polish . 
  pray tell why the polish educational system would spend precious few history hours talking about the portuguese empire ? 
  games can teach you about things and places that school does n't have time to teach you . 
  at the very least , it can act as a gateway for you to become interested in something and go out to learn more from other sources , it 's certainly not sad that he learned about it from euiv . 
  you 're right , heavens forbid anyone criticizes those with power and authority . 
  well , i never looked for `` scooby doo '' either , [ but apperantly it 's up by 104 % last year ] ( http://cdn1b.static.pornhub.phncdn.com/insights-static//wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3-pornhub-insights-2015-year-in-review-focus-romania.png ), 
  actually if you remember the 2015 statistics from january or so , `` local porn '' was the top or close to the top searches in most countries , dunno why , but it 's not specific to the netherlands . 
  are you sure you want to wall off the peloponnese ? 
  the lacedaemonians might not appreciate that ... 
  would n't say i 'm ` sure ' about it , but it makes sense . 
  people will say they believe in `` something '' in order to end the discussion in a non controversial and non confrontational way . 
  that way no one except the most fundamentalist believers can be offended by what they said . 
  are all of them lying ? 
  no , but if i was trying to be gentle with pious people , i 'd probably say something like that too . 
  i do n't believe our world is hell at all btw . 
  yes , there is a lot of suffering , and the universe is random and uncaring , but when you put it all in perspective and think about how far we 've come , i think we 're doing okay . 
   a petition against gay marriage , not against homosexuals . 
  semantics are fun . 
  they 're against unions of gay people , when you say `` marriage '' we 're talking about lawful unions , you wo n't see 2 girls or 2 guys get married in a church , so our church has zero business getting involved . 
  it 's absolutely against homosexuals and it is because of religious beliefs , at least for the vast majority it is , i 'm sure there are a few atheists out there with serious sexuality frustrations who hate gays too . 
  the rest ? 
  just people steeped in medieval age thinking . 
  in the meanwhile in romania 1.5 million people signed a petition against homosexuals . 
  why now ? 
  this is n't the first attack by far . 
  nevermind the place already being a clusterfuck with the us and russians involved . 
  russian for when we 'll have to communicate with our new overlords . 
  i know !, 
  i 've been following it to some extent - still - i would consider what has happened so far a failure already . 
  maybe i should n't talk , considering the kind of people we elect , but then again , i ( perhaps wrongly ) hold the us to a higher standard . 
  the colonials have recognized their failures following the recent presidential nomination elections and have chosen to dissolve their republic and re-pledge their nation to queen lizzy . 
  i too am against those that try to spread the teachings of mehrunes dagon . 
  moldova republic would be the obvious choice , [ but an empire sounds more tempting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire ) . 
  they stole them from the women , obviously . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  replace our leadership with foreigners ( [ we 've done it before and it worked out pretty well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carol_i_of_romania ) ) and give us lots of money . 
  i understand how countries that used to be great powers in the previous century might not be pleased with such an idea , but we ? 
  we 're a colony already , things can only get better if the leadership here has to answer more directly to an eu government . 
   was wearing a pair of nike well that solves it , it could n't have been one of those middle eastern types , [ i think we have our culprits right here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiwkggu.jpg ) . 
  not sure how you go from him saying `` it 's not as fucked up as some of the users here want you to believe '' to `` nye attacks were a conspiracy !, 
  middle eastern gropers do n't melt steel beams ! '', 
  [ romanian halls of government ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d5sa2yq-2g ), 
  do n't know what you 're talking about , australia is already in europe . 
  a lot of people would n't exist if the fascists won ww2 ... 
  it was a joke ( he only sold the commercial fleet  ) but clearly / r/romania 's political brigades seep in here too . 
  silly portugal . 
  that boat will never carry you to new spain . 
   he 'll just start speaking some really fucked up nonsense so that hillary can win i ca n't imagine what he could say that would completely disqualify him at this point . 
  actually the klingons kind of were supposed to be the russians , but only really in the original series . 
  they probably hate it . 
  those people who worked hard to integrate with their adoptive cultures could now end up being seen as no different to the average observer . 
  if i was n't white and i 'd be living in a western european country , i 'd probably be fighting this harder than any would be patriots . 
  found trump 's secret account . 
  i thought a certain pirate sold our entire navy . 
  i know russians are the big bad and all , but that does n't mean you can pretend they 're somewhere else . 
  to be fair , later in the article he does mention that the us justice model is a failure and `` even nonviolent offenders are routinely locked up for decades . '', 
  this reads like an onion article . 
  you would have potentially thousands of people watched 24/7 , by whom ? 
  armed guards ? 
  cameras ? 
  that is besides the point anyway . 
  if what you care about is the safety and mental well being of the victims , then a separate facility is the best solution . 
  it 's the simplest solution . 
  honestly , this is a non issue , judging by your posts , you 're just trying to piggyback on this thing to make an entirely separate point . 
  wait , what ? 
  that is your solution as opposed to another facility for the victims ? 
  how is that a more efficient solution ? 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/28/us/colorado-planned-parenthood-shooting/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_tiller or for a longer , more fun list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_the_united_states#christian_extremism people do n't like it when you point this shit out . 
  it gets them upset . 
  because they know christians , they have christians in their family . 
  their parents are probably christian , their grandparents almost certainly are .
