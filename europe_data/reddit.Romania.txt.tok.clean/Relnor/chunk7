  they know the cases i linked above are the fringe , the christians ** they ** know would never do something like that . 
  on the other hand , take a scary sounding , foreign , alien religion , of whom they do n't personally know anyone and suddenly it 's much easier to say `` oh , yup , those guys , many of them are bad guys '' . 
  if the majority or even a significant portion of the muslim population would actually be extremist , we would be well and truly fucked , cause there are a lot of them . 
  by that logic , american christians are clearly more extreme than european christians . 
  after all , you have the westboro baptist church . 
  i would have preferred a horse head in her bed though . 
  using a pig cause muslims is low hanging fruit . 
  while i 'm not a vegetarian , i do n't drink alcohol ( not out of principle , just not into it ) and i 'm already starting to feel like invading poland . 
  the guy who says it 's `` too dangerous for the general public '' must be seriously out of touch . 
  anyone who really , really wanted to read this thing could have obtained it ( albeit illegally ) on the internet , it was n't some closely guarded secret hidden away in some vault . 
   there was n't a single instance of abuse of power to prolong their stay . 
  well , true , there was n't , until , you know . . ** that one time ** . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_of_the_roman_republic, 
  i 'm not saying erdogan has no blame in it at all , of course he 's an authoritarian . 
  what i mean by `` deeply rooted '' is that these things do n't just happen on their own . 
  its not a scary dictator on his throne that thunders all these orders down and the frightful servants obey . 
  it 's an administration ( and i 'm not talking about close associates , but as i said , thousands of public functionaries ) , that enthusiastically implements not only the authoritarian leader 's direct orders , ** but also his ideas `` in spirit '' ** - he does n't have to order this kind of dissent suppressed , the servants are quick to step up before he even says anything , to a zealous level . 
  this has happened all over eastern europe with the communist regimes , and elsewhere with pretty much any kind of authoritarian regime ever , there always seem to be fervent supporters who ca n't wait to implement the leadership 's policies with an almost religious righteousness about them . 
  it 's all erdogan this , erdogan that , but what about the people that reported these kids in the first place ? 
  why did they do that ? 
  how did they become so rotten ? 
  if you thought i was talking about the turkish people in general , i was n't , this exact same thing has happened in every authoritarian regime , i guess the tldr is that people everywhere can be shitty . 
  when i was 15 years old , the height of defiance for me and my collegues was skipping class to go home and play video games . 
  a lot of you guys have it all wrong - this is n't fucked up because erdogan was `` personally insulted '' - he was n't . 
  do you really think he even ** heard ** about this story before it came out in the media ? 
  or that he personally ordered these kids expelled ? 
  ofcourse not . 
  what happened is a lot more fucked up than that : it 's not the first time we hear a story like this , it just shows there is a whole state apparatus , tens of thousands of people that grovel at the feet of the leadership and zealously defend against and supress even the slightest perceived dissent . 
  this is no different than what was happening in communist romania , where neighbours would report their neighbours for an anti-party joke . 
  if all the blame would rest with erdogan as many posts here make it out to be , then that would be great , eventually he wo n't be in power anymore and all would be rosy and great , right ? 
  nope . 
  he 's just the top dog now , the real problem is more deeply rooted than that . 
  you can only see things within your own experience and your own context , completely incapable of realizing that not everyone is well informed , educated , or even intelligent . 
  hopefully you 'll never end up having to make decisions for a lot of people . 
  because it sounds cool ? 
   i would love to see more women be strong in the islamic community and if you 're overly optimistic ( as i tend to be ) you could say that this can be a gateway to that , they wo n't just shed their faith right away , it 's too big a part of their identity . 
  but hey , maybe if they 're there on their own talking about islam without a bunch of old dudes telling them `` the truth '' , some of them will stop one day and say `` hang on , as a woman , this is a pretty shitty deal '' - obviously subtler than that , but one can hope . 
  what are russia 's objectives in this cataclysmic , civilization-ending conflict ? 
  easy for you to say from your western high information bubble , but when you 're living in a closed society and everyone tells you things should be a certain way , you end up believing it , it starts early , and it 's not something you easily rationalize away . 
  never mind that there are serious threats on your life if you try to leave . 
  by this logic everyone a few hundreds years ago was a complete moron since christianity was just as violent and sexist and no one just stopped and said `` hey wait guis , are n't we being sexist and violent ?! '', 
  / yawn , every once in awhile a russian minister will come out and say something controversial to keep the propaganda machine spinning . 
  in 2014 we had this scandal between our ex-president and one of their vice premiers where they called each other drunks after he was denied flight over romania and he said he will `` visit romania in a bomber '' . 
  i think another time the same guy said something like `` tank 's do n't need visas '' , which i admit was kind of funny but it was the same kind of saber-rattling nonsense . 
  yes !, 
  be afraid !, 
  be very afraid !, 
  they 're here !, 
  they 're everywhere !, 
  they 're around every corner !, 
  pretty sure back at home unless he was someone powerful and influential he would have been strung up already . 
  there are a lot of legitimate complaints about the cultures these people come from ranging from abhorrent treatment of women to that of lgbt people or just human rights in general , but insinuating he would n't have been lynched by a mob back in iraq or syria is disingenuous at best . 
  fear mongering and sabre rattling . 
  putin might be a cynical , brutal oligarch but he will not be nuking anyone . 
  why would he nuke someone and basically put all of human civilization at risk when he can quietly continue doing what he 's been doing in ukraine and other neighbors ( what is even happening in georgia nowadays ? 
  never hear about it around here ) without any serious intervention or risk ? 
   so your reaction is to come to foreign forum , which fundamentally hates our country , to make them laugh and humiliate you and the country , those people will be happy the entire week for the bad news from our country . 
  you deserve that what happened to you . 
  i wish you disappear from the country , one way or another . 
  pravda approved translation : comrade !, 
  we are terribly disappointed with your choice of words !, 
  you run to the evil imperialist pig-dogs and complain to them about patently false issues within our glorious republics !, 
  the capitalist swine-pigs will rejoice for a week at these falsehoods !, 
  a ~ ~ firing squad ~ ~ free state-sponsored vacation awaits you in siberia to change your mind on such issues . 
   the quran is meant to be taken literally , the bible is n't . 
  depends which christian denomination you 're talking about and even inside those denominations it depends on the individual and their upbringing . 
  what makes you think christians are so diverse in their beliefs from ultra-conservative to very permissive while muslims are a unified , singular block ? 
  how many of these were deeply religious/practicing though ? 
  in some government census somewhere , i 'm put down as orthodox christian , even though i 'm as atheist as can be . 
  i would however have no qualms lying about it and saying i 'm totally christian if i felt it benefited me in a particular situation , after all it is all pretend stuff . 
  ca n't see why we would want to have a union with them . 
  i know all the `` patriots '' will rage at me , but we would be uniting with a poorer country that we would then have to invest in . 
  we 'd also be getting all of those moldovan politicians - if you think our guys are corrupt , oh just you wait until you see what they 're doing over there . 
  or what ? 
  do you think all of the moldovan politicians will just go take up different careers ? 
  i do n't see any benefits for romania , other than giving russia the middle finger ( tempting , but not worth the cost ) and `` there is more of the place i was born in on the map now '' from the rabidly patriotic types . 
  thanks . 
  i can have a lot more fun than i would if i would be breathing in smoke with ** literally ** every breath . 
  you can poison yourself and only yourself by walking outside for your nicotine shot . 
  the rest of us non-addicts want to be able to breathe . 
  you know very well most places used to allow people to smoke all over the place . 
  maybe this will also lower smoking overall and save some people 's fucking lives . 
  but hey , if you want lung cancer , that 's up to you , the `` nanny state '' wo n't protect you . 
  nothing new here . 
  we had a few refugees enter our country by mistake a few months back and they were like `` we are where ? 
  romania ? 
  oops . 
  our bad . 
  we 'll be on our way now '' our poverty and lower quality of life spared us !, 
  as someone who 's never smoked nor intends to , its a great change . 
  most clubs and bars were unbearable smokestacks , sometimes it would feel like you 're breathing in more smoke than actual air . 
  hell , even places where people would eat routinely allowed smoking . 
  good . 
  i 'm an atheist , and yes , i do find the flying sphagetti monster thing funny , and i think it illustrates a point very well , but do you ** have ** to bother authorities with your nonsense ? 
  also , do you ** have ** to constantly go around trying to invalidate the feelings of others ? 
  what if some people use religion as refuge from a lot of suffering ? 
  is it a delusion ? 
  yes , its all bullshit . 
  does it make them feel better ? 
  yes . 
  and who are you to take that away from them ?
