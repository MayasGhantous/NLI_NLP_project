  obviously theres a whole discussion to be had about indoctrinating children and violent acts in the name of religion , but going around telling the average religious person `` your feelings are buuuullshiiit !, 
  seems incredibly cruel and it 's not the kind of atheism i want to be associated with or part of . 
  rds is a national company , they only operate in romania unlike all those other multi-national companies that you pay out the nose for and that does n't care about you . 
  they established their infrastructure in the early 2000s and while there were a few years with hiccups/stability problems , we now have one of the most stable and fast internet speeds in europe . 
  apperantly when you have a smaller customer base you care more about not pissing them all off . 
  you 're right . 
  we should do one of those good , wholesome stake burnings again for all these ` heretics ' . 
  pretty ironic that you make an allusion to nazis while you 're on the side of `` this group of people should n't have the same rights we do '' . 
  the authorities here are always `` taken by surprise '' when it snows as if it 's a freak event that can happen at any time . 
  i do n't agree with everything modern day feminists and gender equality movements say , but the things that singer in the title said are incredibly regressive . 
  `` it 's ** not your place ** to earn as much as i do , go back to making babies '' - it 's totally reprehensible and shows a baffling lack of empathy . 
  i suppose the short of it is that people should stop being dicks to eachother and allow everyone to live as they want as long as it does n't infringe on someone else 's rights . 
  the quouted singer , as well as feminists who take personal offence at women who choose to fulfill traditional roles , are incapable of following this simple rule . 
   relax , take a deep breath and calm down . 
  i 'm super calm , thanks . 
   there is nothing wrong with someone who wants to embrace their traditional gender role . 
  nope , there is n't anything wrong . 
  equally , there is nothing wrong with someone who ** does not want to ** . 
   this modern day society seems to forcefully push women to become ` independant ' and ` self-sustaining ' . 
  this is how societies work . 
  this is push-back for centuries of literal enslavement . 
  the pendulum swings hard in the opposite direction , there are excesses , but , at the end of the day , no one is forcing anyone to do anything , if you want to assume a traditional role , you can , and people who look down on you are just idiots . 
   it 's actually a very feminine and natural thing . 
  nothing about modern society is really ` natural ' - and telling people that this is the ` natural ' way to do things subsequently implies that if they do n't , it 's unnatural and bad - that 's not a very nice thing to say to someone who just wants to do their own thing . 
  who exactly is `` pushing '' men and women into the same roles ? 
  where is this said ? 
  what exactly is so bad about being allowed to do whatever you want with your life ? 
  are n't those the values we adhere to here in europe ? 
  self determination ? 
  free will ? 
  you know , we can at least pretend . 
  then this idiot comes along and says if you 're a woman you should `` belong to someone '' ? 
  and you should `` give a child to someone '' - the child belongs to that someone else , you 're just a dispenser , right ? 
  what . 
  the . 
  and i believe that everyone should be allowed to follow whatever goal they want in life instead of being lumped under their `` traditional gender role '' - regardless if we 're talking about men or women . 
  traditions are ** not ** holy , they are ** not ** all worth keeping . 
  some of them are shit , and we should ( and have ) evolved past them . 
  you agree with the principles because it 's convinient for you . 
  if the shoe were on the other foot and you would be told you ca n't earn as much as a woman because you 're a man , or you ca n't do xyz job , you 'd change your tune . 
  if we even want to pretend we like `` freedom '' and `` democracy '' and all those other `` good western values '' then forcing people into specific roles because of how they were born is not the way to go . 
  otherwise , saudi arabia is an excellent model and we should all follow suit . 
  yeah , i 'll get downvoted , but fuck everything about this - a woman earning as much as a man or being allowed to do things other than birth and raise children wo n't destroy society . 
   my little its ok , i 'm sure it 's about average size for europe . 
  romanian does n't ** really ** sound like russian if you listen to two speakers side by side , but certain very common words ( yes = da for example ) are the same as in russian so if that is all you pick up i understand why you 'd mistake it for russian . 
  yeah was n't entirely serious , was mostly trying to rib on them for appearing ungreatful . 
  but in a sense , i do understand them , it can be difficult being away from home , especially in a culture very different from what you 're used to , things like climate only exacerbate the issue . 
  people get homesick , apperantly welfare is n't enough to make up for not being where you 've grown up surrounded by people like you . 
  said this before , they can go if they want - i 'll come instead . 
  university educated , atheist , used to snow . 
  do n't speak finnish but i studied languages so i could probably learn . 
  deal ? 
  facebook i get - although - it still should not be up to a government to regulate who is allowed onto it . 
  but email ? 
  are you insane ? 
  you need an email . 
  for legitimate , school related purposes . 
  i live in ** romania ** and even we used emails in high school . 
  this sort of policing should be the responsability of parents . 
  if the parents ca n't deal with what their kids are doing online - then that is bad parenting and the problem should be solved there , not at a legislative level . 
  aye komrad , they smear image of glorious republics and of great tsar with their imperialist notions of free speech and right to protest . 
  constitution be only paper , words of tsar be as holy as those of patriarch . 
  we take people with wrong opinions , give them fresh siberian outdoor vacation , their opinions turn right , everyone happy , win-win !, 
  similar story - we even have a joke about it which i 'm sure you know . 
  the transilvanian goes to his magyar neighbour and says `` neighbour , i 'm going to have to kill you now '' - `` but , why ?!, 
  '' , he asks . 
  `` you magyars killed michael the brave . '', 
  `` but neighbour , that was 400 years ago ! '', 
  `` yeah , but i found out yesterday . '', 
  you seem to think i 'm in favour of one side or another , both of them have hatreds that run deep and neither are willing to even start a process of reconciliation = tribalism . 
   would turkish government accept that ? 
  no , because despite all the supposed sophistication these rivalries and others like them are still firmly stuck in tribalism . 
  romanians are white enough that pc rules do n't apply . 
  you know shit is fucked up when people arguing against capital punishment get downvoted . 
  the terrorists are bringing out the worst in all of you and making you feel good about it too . 
  you know , romania had an 800,000-ish germanic minority in the early 20th century , and nowadays around here germanness is right next to godliness , so naturally the right place to migrate to !, 
  you ca n't be both stupid and cunning , they kind of cancel eachother out . 
  maybe you mean they were under-handed . 
  peter jackson called , he wants the count to return his lotr remake script immediately . 
  being incompetent at everything to the point that it 's really funny . 
  if you have no financial woes and understand the language , romania is the best place to live , you can just sit down , turn on the tv ( to a news channel ) and laugh the day away . 
  who needs comedians when it all writes itself ? 
  be careful if you run for public office though , there are murmurs that all public officials are implanted with chips that constantly loop this inside their heads : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lqftyk2n8o, 
  hey , hey !, 
  it was english-japanese at least , that 's got to be worth something , right ? 
  maybe ? 
  please . . 
  i was derpy and did language & literature instead , where do i sign up for that one ? 
  yes , 6,33 is n't good . 
  6 is the passing grade . 
  or maybe it 's just 5 for the 8th grade exam . 
  but for the bacalaureate ( end of high school ) and any final university stuff , it 's 6 .
