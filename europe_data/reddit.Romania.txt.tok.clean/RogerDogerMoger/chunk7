  or russians and romanians !, 
  or romanians and other romanians !, 
  damn romanians , they ruined romania !, 
  seriously , if you comment anything that might be mildly offensive , you just unleashed the hounds on your ass . 
  romanian or not . 
  you should see the toxicity in facebook arguments . 
  that 's the good stuff . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the uk will do its britbong magic to get better stats than france . 
  just to spite her . 
  al-wot wot the fuck you said about me m9 ? 
  i 'll have you know that britbongia once ruled the waves and had over 300 million people in the british raj . 
  if it makes you feel better , i only know austria for the hre . 
  you 're a brit . 
  just look at a map of europe or something . 
   r/ukpolitics is a little more balanced , but is nothing but politics  r/ukpolitics  name m'gentleman . 
  / balk / the only thing you 'll ever need . 
  so like the / hell / threads on 4chan ? 
  `` hey greece , you dropped a coin , let me pick it up for you . '', 
  / pol / is n't the us . 
   fabricating territorial claims and pressing them * eu4 intensifies *, 
  whining about shit is reddit 's thing . 
  kinda like calling for genocide on 4chan or making meme dumps om imgur or eating your own shit on 9gag . 
   like  comment  subscribe  favorite this guy . 
  one of you can out shitpost the whole of europe . 
   a taxi obeying these rules ... those exist ? 
  is this the first time this has been posted ? 
  i remember a thread on / pol / about it a few days ago , and it 's the first time i see it here . 
   the false song of memeism [ come on , love , there 's nothing that can go wrong . 
  wew lad did he just go super sayan ? 
  would n't a norway deal mean you have to obey euro laws without a say in them ? 
  it started circulating on / pol / almost immediately . 
  so they tried to 4chan but safe-space ? 
   visit the balkans instead why do they want to flood our countries and change demographics is n't this against their ideology ? 
  fuck off we 're full, 
  someone literally started a laugh at le pen thread . 
  good shit . 
  `` france needs another bataclan '' has been floating around for * months * . 
  not sure why you 're surprised . 
  calm . 
  / ptg / - president donald general thread . 
  despre donaldo in general . 
   and are free to voice their opinion in the form of a downvote even though that is not the intended use of the downvote this is why 4chan hates reddit . 
  i swear they would overlap much more if there were n't votes . 
  / r/the _ donald and related are his subs and you can definitely feel it . 
  very good atmosphere and friendly people in all honesty . 
  t_d the only truly pro-trump place on 4chan are the donald generals on / pol / . 
  even in the rest of / pol / people hate him . 
  more like a bunch americans were under constant attack and migrated to a safe space . 
  needs a `` really makes you think '' remark , and that emoji that managed to meme its way into 4chan . 
  then someone could post it and trigger / pol / . 
  uber shills confimerd where da jews, 
  how about a switzerlake ? 
  it would make sense to a roman i guess . 
  i kinda wonder who the next china is gon na be . 
  east africa ? 
   europe well , what did you expect ? 
  just call it mcdicks like the educated 4chan classes do . 
  * trggered * those are n't even alphabets . 
  an alphabet is one symbol per sound . 
  katakana and hiragana are syllabaries , so one symbol per syllable . 
  kanji is a logography , so one symbol per word . 
  sorry if i was an asshole , but this activates my almonds . 
  lennies aside , i 've discovered that greek sounds like italian . 
  must be all the roman blood and other fluids that got shoved up the hellass . 
  i knew about / pol / and the others but / new / i 've never heard out . 
  thanks for telling . 
  eh , if they overdo it they 'll get punished like last time probably . 
  how so ? 
  shills get called out quickly . 
  / pol / was never with trump because / pol / never agrees with anything . 
  just a small subset . 
  but these downvotes illustrate reddit 's problem . 
  yeah . 
  anything reddit is mocked viciously . 
  especially t_d since they 've become one of reddit 's echo chambers and they try to start circlejerk threads . 
  just stay on the trump general is you support him . 
  well i do . 
  subs become echo chambers pretty quickly . 
  people on / pol / will disagre with you even for the sake of disagreeing . 
  i like it . 
  so ... do we throw the `` welcome to eastern europe '' party now or ... ? 
  just wait until they realize that they 've become / pol / ' s laughing stock . 
  they have , quite litterally , sunk to a new low . 
  / pol / has been colonizing like they 're polynesians , eh ? 
  * we can see greece , in his natural habitat , being horrified that someone would n't pay denbts . 
  he meant warhammers . 
  obviously . 
  i do n't get it . 
  many moldovans in transylvania ? 
  some guy from / int / has been complaining about it in / balk / threads . 
  this . 
  just browse a little on / pol / and you 'll find out that it 's an unorganized mesh of ideologies . 
  the only things that persists is that straya , muhple leafs and finns make the best shitposters . 
  at least a good chunk of germoldova was n't claimed by the democratic union of democratic soviet socialist democratic people 's republics . 
  tovarish , please head to the demokratik people 's 123 not gulag street and present yourself to the demokratik people 's politburo for demokratik and voluntary reedukashun . 
  it 's more of a general thing . 
  it 's hard to catch things on the fly . 
  sage, 
  yay for poland . 
  aussies confirmed best shitposters kek bless,
