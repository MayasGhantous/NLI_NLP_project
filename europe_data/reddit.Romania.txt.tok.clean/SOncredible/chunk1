mention 2 : you forgot to say that the totalitarian regime , inducted and protected by the intelligence force `` securitate '' created a atmosphere of untrust and fear , which was the main reason the revolution and the executation of ceau\u0219escu happened . 
  i have to deal with this in my everyday life . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  lovely to see him just doing his job but silent protest against the circumstances with his shirt . 
  can we please let more bulgarians participate on the russian olimpics ? 
  pls . 
  pls . 
  what is the meaning of the word in the response ? 
  anyway , nice gesture from both sides . 
  wow , this really works :d, 
  that was fast . 
  go france !, 
  you 're still in this penis comparison games ? 
  germans and brits are right now ( as much as i know ) the only european contries availible to host such a big prestige event without going completely bankrupt . 
  london did even make a small win during the olimpics 2012 . 
  looking forward to it . 
  in germany there 's [ a discussion ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/em-2020-wird-in-13-staedten-ausgetragen-a-879727.html ) right now if they should choose munich , berlin , stuttgart or dortmund to host some games . 
   ** military service ** poor young , male austrians :(, 
  [ common guys !, 
  you can do it too . 
  do n't be so shy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lgykesy.jpg ), 
  cool map . 
  i 'm so intrigued with the `` no data '' regions ... 
  do not forget [ klaus iohannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_iohannis ) , the mayor of sibiu and the president of the democratic forum of germans in romania . 
  no one really hate him . 
  many people love him , and he is very succesfull doing his job . 
  good man . 
  why , hello japan \u0ca0 \u25e1 \u0ca0, 
  in germany is just like you would expect it would be . 
  there was a popular song some years ago from `` wir sind helden '' . 
  it describes the situation in germany very good . 
  no hard feelings from any size . 
  btw . 
  [ relevant breast cup size woldmap ] ( http://cdn1.billjaquette.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/breastcupsize.png?4d9d5d ), 
  come on , man ... do n't break the spirit here ... you 're in r/europe . 
  the most pleasant circlejerk on reddit . 
  wow ... never thought of this . 
  shitty weather and the use of internet are indeed correlated . 
  except madrid , catalonia , corsica and france 's south . 
  they 're just l\u00e9g\u00e8re ;d, 
  there are a lot of reasons . 
  if you 're interrested , you can find some good discussions and some explanatory links in [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/13r9fm/world_map_of_internet_speed_2012_1711_x_890/ ), 
  very interresting indeed . 
  while romania have the fastest ( average ) internet in europe [ and second fastest in the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v8xgv.png ) , the [ recent data posted above ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=isoc_ci_ifp_fu&amp;lang=en ) by half_wit , shows that there are not really much internet users there . 
  so when we speak about a `` digital divide '' , we can be sure that romania is one of the best representatives for it . 
  dude !, 
  your whole life was a lie . 
  wut where are you from ? 
  seems legit, 
  converting luxembourg and saarland into a new bundesland would solve a lot of problems . 
  at least for saarland . 
  and the language barrier would n't be that big ... 
  poor depardieu ... 
  had some great partys in ireland, 
  that culture clash !!, 
  ( except `` mallorca-action '' , which is loved by both ), 
  russia-china would be the killer . 
  could you expand that please ? 
  i am not aware about these `` things '' . 
  seems like an interessting little story, 
  i thought you would say bavaria, 
  indeed . 
  about ~ 1,237,746  - still ... by far moldova in the first place . 
  same language , same religion , same ancestors , etc. . . - hungary would be second because of known reasons ... - i think serbia could come very close in third place . 
  there 's much sympathy with serbia in romania . 
  moldova of course, 
  \u0414\u044f\u0434\u043e \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430 is coca-colas santa claus \u0414\u044f\u0434\u043e \u041c\u0440\u0430\u0437 is the real one `` grandpa frost '' . 
  same in romania , poland , germany and think almost all christian europe, 
  we had * mo\u0219 geril\u0103 * thousends of years in romania . 
  well ... until that coca-cola * santa claus * marketing gag in the 60s-70s . 
  now more and more every year coca-colas * mo\u0219 cr\u0103ciun * is sort of kicking out our * mo\u0219 geril\u0103 * . 
  same thing in germany with the * christkind * and * v\u00e4terchen frost * being kicked out by the coca-colas * weihnachtsmann * . 
  can you see the aurora borealis also during the summer ? 
  are there some predator animals in lapland ? 
  looks like an awesome place for some weeks of summer hike, 
  * per se, 
  did some research . 
  mindblowing : they had ** two chinese ** ( daniel hu , josh lam ) and ** one romanian ** ( matei mandache ) contester in their team this year :d [ source ] ( http://www.imo-official.org/country_individual_r.aspx?code=unk ), 
  nice to know . 
  thanks . 
  to be fair , the insect incident happened in ostende maybe after about my 10th try and at a new merchant . 
  the other times i was fully satisfied . 
  found some fellow campers in bredene and we aggreed that dried fish is the best snack for beer drinkers . 
  lifeprotips, 
  this summer i walked ~ 500 km in three weeks from saarland ( ger ) through luxembourg-brussel-brugge to ostende ( bredene ) 1 - brugge is a really awesome city . 
  must see 2 - brussels looks nothing like belgium and for me it was the most boring and somehow depressing capital i was ever in . 
  i 'm sorry , maybe just bad luck 3 - antwerpen . 
  awesome things to see and to explore in this city . 
  fell in love with the city . 
  4 - mussels and fries at the sea side tipp : chose carefully where you buy from . 
  found various insects , spiders and all kind of life forms in my mussel soup in ostende . 
  i 'm grossed out till that day . 
  5 - ghent ( ca n't say nothing . 
  never was there ) also : if you eat belgian fries , take the time and try all their sauces . 
  if you try various exotic beers , ask the waiter or bartender about their annecdotes about the beer . 
  a new world will oppens to you . 
  south korea ? 
  china ? 
  to be fair : they were busy winning the european championship in handball . 
  the time stands still there and you 'll meet the warmest people ever,
