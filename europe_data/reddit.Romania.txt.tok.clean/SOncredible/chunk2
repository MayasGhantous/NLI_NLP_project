  are you kidding ? 
  it 's not funny . 
  it 's sexy as hell, 
  yup . 
  that is some serious tasty stuff, 
  [ poultry feet ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/chicken_feet.jpg/640px-chicken_feet.jpg ) and [ porc feet ] ( https://escacicuina.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peus-de-porc-al-forn.jpg ) are common dishes in romania . 
  also the majority of saarland , germany ( mostly lower class ) they put [ maggi w\u00fcrze ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/maggiw%c3%bcrze-neu.jpg ) on everything . 
  and by everything i mean ** everything !, 
  now_kiss . avi, 
  island is actually very obsessed with their hot dogs, 
  sometimes it 's not even pizza, 
  i can confirm `` put all corrupt politicians behind bars '' makes a nice goal  we should have started much earlier . 
  you 're right . 
  blue is own gas extraction . 
  so , this news is quite exciting , makes a good headline , but one have to see it in perspective, 
  bada bada ... iron man,

  you know , a lot of countries have air forces ... 
  i think that he do n't really tell the truth , but then again he is not even liyng  it 's about nostaliga . 
  during the communism , we all grew up with 1 kind of chocolate , 1 kind of eiscreem , 1 kind of pickles , soda , and so on ... 
  i growed up with [ this ] ( https://i2.wp.com/amintirifrumoase.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/68598_10202113575546345_7898995781530320381_n.jpg ) as the only chocolate you could get in romania ( if you did not have relatives in diaspora or your parents did not worked for securitate ) . 
  all chocolates after that in my life were more or less `` meh '' ... 
  i 'm sure tho , it would taste semi-mediocre . 
  only if i 'd hat a chance to get one again ... 
  still well done ,

  oh thanks . 
  i see it now . 
  i just realized eastern europeans are so used to take that kind of shit from western media , that it does n't bother us anymore . 
  i do n't get it . 
  belgrad is in serbia . 
  topic here is romania, 
  romanian living in germany here . 
  it 's all cool . 
  some german politicians are just criticizing the croatian politics at the moment . 
  they are already sick of the politic telenovela in romania that occurs at the moment . 
  we could all aggree about that . 
  no need to argue, 
  hey !, 
  nothing wrong with saarl\u00e4nders . 
  never see ** that ** happen !, 
  i love how all the dacians gone suddenly dead , leaving today 's romania for more than a milenium uninhabited . 
  must have been some hell of a time / irony off, 
  i saw this so many times ... wonderfull movie [ joyeux no\u00ebl ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424205/ ) and [ la vita \u00e8 bella ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/ ) are also very good . 
  same genre, 
  yes !, 
  that is the one we 're talking about . 
  browse your link to germany section and you will find the d\u00f6ner you will see these times from scandinavia to iberia and from britain to balcan . 
  d\u00f6ner is german . 
  turkish community in berlin created it in the 70 ' . 
  it 's really really creepy . 
  some weeks ago here on reddit there was [ this ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/v3fxn/i_was_a_machine_gunner_during_a_major_iraq_war/ ) of this machine gunner in iraq , he got home and found out he does n't received enough credit for killing a bunch of people and got pissed about it . 
  that fact and the supportive comments were to much for me .

  i live for 20 years now in germany . 
  and by now i feel like 51 % romanian and 49 % german . 
  but there 's no such tag here , 
   we do n't get money in germany this is what deutsches rotes kreuz want you to think . 
  they want to sell it themselves for profit . 
  every bundesland have one or more kliniks where you can donate blood for money . 
  then they sell your blood for big money to a hospital . 
  the same like in germany . 
  i prefere donating it directly to a hospital ( klinik ) and get from 25 , - to 40 , - eur, 
  ** german hospital : ** * 25 , - $ * ( can vary depends which hospital/land ) * * free , unlimited non-alcoholic drinks * ( not to take away ) * ** german red cross : ** * 1 sandwich * 1 chocolate * unlimited cola * unlimited saltsticks ( nothing to take away ),

  well , the ones who pushed for the referendum declared that the romanians are desparate and want `` the dictator '' out . 
  it looks like it was n't true at all . 
  well , the ones who pushed for the referendum declared that the romanians are desparate and want `` the dictator '' out . 
  it looks like it was n't true at all . 
  nah ... that is normal . 
  because of the historical influence of the austro-hungarian empire on the people here , transilvania and banat were culturally always more `` western '' oriented ... 
  i just feel some french accent in this portugese . 
  do she have a dialect ? 
  nice videos though, 
  same here ;( this kind of shitty music pops up everywhere in romania these days . 
  it 's not about making music here . 
  it 's about getting international and earning money . 
  i am so happy that they do n't succeed, 
  sadly she 's not with dj project anymore :(, 
  do n't even bother to get the reddit enhancement suite . 
  it 's a shame to see that almost every post here have more downvotes than upvotes . 
  this is absolutely not what r/europe is about ... 
  that 's right . 
  `` bei dem '' is often shortened to `` beim '' .
