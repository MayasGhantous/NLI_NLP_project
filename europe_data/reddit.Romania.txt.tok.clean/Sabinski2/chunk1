ah ... communism ... . eraticated those old and beutifull buildings and saved this ugly concrete box to show how great respect they have for property . 
  so in german law , when do you transfer the property right in case of estate trading ? 
  after you `` clean '' the estate of your furniture and then give away the keys ? 
  or does the principle of abstraction apply here as well . 
  well , i said it for experts then . 
  right , for us , e.g. 
  we have 3 obligation of the saler in a sale contract . 
  to give the right to buyer ( in abstracto , the power to control , the will to control , different than the good itself ) to give the good that we are trading , and to guarentee ( that remains in buyer 's property ) . 
  art . 
  1672 romanian civil code . 
  but the contract is valide from the moment it is signed . 
  that means the contract starts to have effects in real life . 
  the real right ( property in this case ) is transfered * de plano * from the saler to the buyer . 
  then he must procee to fulfill the rest . 
  for exemple if you sign a contract and dont give the good after , means that you brake your obligations . 
  very nice comparation with the * ius in re * in these two systems . 
  late justice , still justice . 
  well ... about raw meat it says that it 's from romania , but it taste horible , so i do n't buy it . 
  maybe is made in romania , - the product , - but the meat - from the animal - isnt from our farms for sure . 
  too many preservatives for a local product . 
  here is diferent . 
  they bring everything from abroad . 
  the food is terrible . 
  meat is not meat , just salt and water , nobody buys the cans , and its 33 % more expensive ( like a polish guys said ) here in lidl-romania than in lidl-poland . 
  in my opinion , lidl 's stuff isnt cheap at all . 
  kaufland on the other hand ... 
  laserul de la m\u0103gurele , am i assuming right ? 
  why romania doesnt have researchers ... oh yea ... they are all working in other countries . 
  can you also make a short summary of each party . 
  like doctrine , waht they want , who is voting for them , etc, 
  watch and learn europe !, 
  with love from romania . 
  wish you best neighboard ~ romania, 
  america , **** yea !, 
  moldova = transilvania = tara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 = same people , the name came a lot more lately, 
  how is that car seen there in the nords ? 
  romanians on hungary 's national day : happy national day !, 
  hungarians on romanian 's national day : mourn day for hungary !, 
  not nationalistic . 
  let me explain , here in romania is a special kind of people that want to look smart and pretend they know everything . 
  they try so hard to look smart and impartial that they agree even with those who say that transylvania was stolen , romania is s *** , everything is better outside , etc. 
  my reactions maybe were exagerated but it express the feelings i have for them . 
  they dont do anything to make things better , they just complain on internet ... 
  i ca n't keep my mouth shut when a `` romanian '' calls his own history fake . 
  ( `` great mythological history '' ), 
  if you know so much about history , you should find by now that nothing is pure or perfect in this world . 
  and by comming here on forums to `` share '' your knowledge in a way that does n't help our country 's image , or even worse , bring arguments that help the ones that threaten our homeland is n't the right thing to do . 
  you love history more than your country . 
  got you again , hungarian , with romanian flag . 
  the internet is full with you . 
  stop talking bad about romania and pretend that you are a romania . 
  we dont hate our country , we love it !, 
  i saw that you commend with a hostile atitudine toward romania in multiple commends . 
  by any chance you are a maghyar from covasna ? 
  the internet is full with `` romanians '' that in fact are huns with romanian citezenship . 
  +1 bravo , true romanian here . 
  in romania they are called sa\u0219i, 
  then you know nothing , our religious figures vanished in night and we found them ( most of them dead ) after the fall of communism in prisons . 
  ceusescu hated the church . 
  in bucharest there are tall buildings that hide old churches even if that stupid soviet constitution shit that we had until 89 said that relgion is free for everyone . 
  nobody respected that . 
  lol , true that , things are much more calm here in romania . 
  connection between romanian and albanian ? 
  i am a romanian , and this is fake news !, 
  looks nice , [ here is another picture of it ] ( http://fs.casapoporului.ro/38518f9a1324a39693597e0ddee7384b.jpg ), 
  ** bad word ** rusia !, 
  welcome to he club portugal !, 
  well ... tell me !, 
  what consequences he faced ? 
  for what i know uk is blocking our investigation . 
  like that guy from skynews who was talking bullsh * t about an imaginary ilegal gun traffic in romania that helps terrorism , no ? 
  ** idiotic primitive alien life for detected ** ** initiate respond protocol ** < < down vote in progress   error : not enough space, 
   britain because then at least he would face consequences . 
  probably you are right , but we already have heli built under airbus licence . 
  ca n't deny that the bell is superior but we know how to operate puma and superpuma . 
  on the other hand viper or yankey are new stuff for us . 
  so that the romanian people were born . 
  does it looks to you that [ this man ] ( https://www.paginademedia.ro/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19961605_2162843387275314_7283316279959761011_n_508_tb730.jpg ) can be stopped ? 
  airbus was obvious . 
  i am surprised that they choice bell . 
  plus patriot system !, 
  iohannis loves trump . 
  is 101 % for sure bell helicopters . 
  anybody know what poland have in attack helicopter matter ? 
  option where : - sikorski ( lockheed martin ) - ah-1 dracula ( romanian model ) - airbus h 215m ( upgrade version of what we have now ), 
  welcome home !, 
   some that 's the key . 
  buddy , russia gov does n't give a damn thing about what you want . 
  and seeing what my neighbor is doing right now , , for the best , we will buy a new high tech security alarm system for our homeland . 
  he is learning . 
  do not let yourself fooled by the sweet words of socialism .

  nah ... this guy is well known for his pro-russian opinions . 
  well . 
  usa have 3 millitary bases here , and uk hates most of easten europe ( source of hate : guys looking for work , man they hate them , have lot of friends working i. london ) ... so yea , usa is # 1 in security matters .
