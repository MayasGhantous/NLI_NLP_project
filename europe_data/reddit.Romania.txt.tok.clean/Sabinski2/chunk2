  nobody is idiot thinking that uk ( e.g ) will help any eastern country . 
  i do n't think that france , uk , for exemple , will ever help us in a open conflict with . . er ... `` bears '' . 
  therefor , we commit to be 100 % pro usa . 
  sorry , guys , that 's the truth . 
  ask your family . 
  where are the sheeps ? 
  romanians unite !, 
  only romania has different enthics ? 
  uh didnt know we are so single . 
  my reaction reading the comments : what ... ? 
  so a man that cheats the most loved person in his life surely will be faithfull to his country ? 
  ( e.g. 
  will not accept goods to break the law etc ) . 
  imo you ca n't trust this kind of person . 
  imo he will try to get things only for his own good . 
  not giving a damn thing about anything . 
  mission complete !, 
  lucky us . 
  we have 6 secret services : sri , sie , sts , spp , dgipi , dgipa ( dim and dsm/j2 ), 
  respect !, 
  i prepared the stick guys ... 
  wow , so mature . 
  triple trigger : is there another name for them too , beside holland ( olanda ) ? 
  `` suggests '', 
  corruption probably .

  the american people grow with the ideea of respecting the gun . 
  here seeing a demon or a gun is the same thing . 
  but i like the idea . 
   is n't doing those thousands who died during the regime any favors . 
  yea right , everyday there is a post about victims of communism regime . 
  we talk about nazi victims so rarely ... / s, 
  so the thousands that died under the communism regime are `` poor , wee us addendum '' for you ? 
  i can only say that i am sorry for you . 
  we are deeply sorry for what happen under the legionary regime . 
  but many more were persecuted and killed in the communist regime ... but who cares ... they were just other romanians ... 
  yummy ... !, 
   i do n't know why so many are afraid to be associated with the balkans . 
  why would you want to ? 
  yes , it is true . 
  but still the system has more experience in field than any other series of missile system . 
  well , we need new equipment . 
  patriot missile system was tested in gulf war , so we know what we are buying . 
   balkans oh , no . . you did n't say that . 
  glory to arstotzka !, 
  especially hugnary . 
  too much romanian blood was spilled after their annexation of [ north transilvania . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_transylvania#/media/file:p%c3%a9rdidasterritorialesrumanas1940-ro.svg ),
