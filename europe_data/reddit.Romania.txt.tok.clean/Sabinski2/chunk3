  we use romanian tab . 
  [ tab-77 ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/fi%c8%99ier:tab-77_apc.jpg ) [ tab-71 ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/fi%c8%99ier:tab-71_land_forces_day_2.jpg ) [ tab-79 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/batalionul_33vanatori_de_munte%2812%29.jpg ) and swiss [ piranha ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/mowag_piranha_iiic_military_parade_on_december_the_1st_2009.jpg ) . 
  wee already have [ iar-330 puma socat ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/list%c4%83_de_echipamente_ale_armatei_rom%c3%a2ne#/media/file:romanian_iar-300.jpg ) romanian prodution and [ iar 330 ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/list%c4%83_de_echipamente_ale_armatei_rom%c3%a2ne#/media/file:iar_330_medevac.jpg ) . 
  the helicopters are good , but the old tabs need to be replaced . 
  edit : in the future we want 42 ( in total ) f-16 , and in the future , the gov plant to buy more german military tehnic like leopard tanks . 
  we kinda like everything from germany . 
  even our president is a sa\u0219 ( german minority ) .

  read books . 
  facts speak louder than words . 
  i am ok with u/protonagap . 
  today we only talk about culture , back in those days people were living trough culture . 
  the memory is still alive ... 
  for religious groups of course . 
  where is that tolerance europe ??? 
  or tolerance apply only to gays ? 
  just write romania lanscape on google to see what are we talking about . 
  free romania !, 
  hater . 
  we had a hungarian dude that tried to blow up a bomb at a military parade on national day . 
  where is the market ? 
  we may not have the most beautiful capital in europe , but at least we have g. firea in our hearths !, 
  nice picture , but transylvania is better . 
  / triggered hungarians, 
  exaggerating . 
  they are lefty for sure , ( social free money and stuff ) but their voters have conservatives values . 
  they do n't like the foreigners to buy our lands yes . 
  they do n't like when eu talks about corruption . 
  yes . 
  anti-gay ? 
  yes , for electorate . 
  finally a nice and simple and effcient gouverment . 
  just psd things . 
  and i respect your opinion !, 
  even if i disagree . 
  nice word !, 
  we are not makers of history . 
  we are made by history . 
  - mlk jr. 
  beautiful !, 
  i like poland !, 
  romanian pessimism at his finest . 
  what did you enjoy in bucharest ? 
  i am very happy to know . 
  the society is awake and they ca n't do what they want . 
  so now they ca n't adapt to it . 
  your diagnostic is correct . 
  do you know how to read ? 
  oldies loves comies . 
  just psd things . 
   accusing them ? 
  of course not . 
  the majority 90 % speaks romanian . 
  the biggest minority ( 5-7 % ) speaks hungarian , then there are the germans ( sa\u0219i ) . 
  romanian is the majority since forever . 
  ( even when it was under austro-hungarian authority the hungarians were still the minority ) ; edit : [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians_in_romania ) they hungarians stay in those mountain regions covasna and harghita . 
  ( good water ), 
  uh ... we hear this everyday in romania . 
  guys from the `` innocent and persecuted '' hungarian minority ( bozgori ) trying to torn us apart . 
  but romania is stronk . 
  ca n't be defeated by words . 
  a romanian - bulgarian economical union would be nice . 
  more than eu . 
  some real investment of private and public funds . 
  or a big fund for both of us . 
  plus we can provide juridical aid . 
  i think will do good for both our economies . 
  we are comming for ya hungary !, 
  his boss ceausescu was overthown . 
  mr. iliescu had 2 and a half mandates as president . 
  because our oldies `` love '' democracy !, 
   basically arguing that the authority prof. bianca gu\u021ban is somehow more relevant than that of larry diamond , a leading political scientist that teaches at stanford university . 
  sa imi recomanzi o carte de larry diamond pe care ai citit-o . 
   this is n't really an argument , it 's populism . 
   the guy thinks he won the argument because i have n't replied to his reddit post in under an hour . 
  looking for help ? 
  because you are not talking to me anymore . 
  edit : gramatic\u0103 . 
  he is imortal !, 
  do n't you know ? 
  is too old ? 
  what ? 
  where did you get that ? 
  why ? 
  it it very easy to be in the party that has the most supports . 
  but being with the majority is n't always the right path ; i will always stand for my values . 
  but you ? 
  you will change them every 3-5 years ; we need stability , strong characters , good people , with good values even if they do n't have populist values like you have . 
  but ... what can i say furthermore ? 
  may god bless you and i hope what is best for you !, 
  dude , that 's the problem . 
  `` modern '' democracy is about lobby , money , etc not the people who should be in center of the system ; si sunt 7 principii ale statului de drept nu doar 4 . 
  un stat care are atributii de doica ? 
   i frankly find it very hard to see the merit in denying other people legal constructs and people should say what is legal and not based on their common beliefs .
