i ca n't really comment on behalf of my fellow co-nationals when it comes to visas because it 's a very broad subject and i would n't be impartial - but it would sure be nice of them to do so after we joined the war in iraq with them , allowed them access to the black sea as well as gave them permission to set up military bases here along with antimissile systems to effectively piss off putin forever . 
  i mean , it 's not like poland and romania are the most relevant eastern allies the us is ever going to get in this area - which might prove relevant in the future , especially after we saw how the eu handled the crimean situation so well . 
  as for people of the other eu countries : if you do n't really see a problem with the fact that citizens of the poorest countries of the eu have to pay 160 $ and go through some worthless paperwork to enjoy the same privilege as you do , then i guess you can go suck an onion . 
  if you want to be right-wing and everything , it 's fine by me : but by leading through an example of `` together when it 's convenient , separate when it does n't suit us '' then you 'll reap what you sow in a couple of years and we 'll all kiss our eu goodbye . 
  to the american people : as much as i would love for you to experience at least a fraction of the kind of bureaucratic shit people in `` less favored '' countries have to go through , i would suggest an injection of realism and consider whom - or what kind of person - would benefit from a move such as this . 
  if you think the criminals around here have issues with money , falsifying documents or smuggling people and [ have never considered ] ( http://www.ceeinsight.net/2013/03/26/romanian-u-s-police-bust-illegal-immigration-ring/ ) crossing the border through mexico then you are very naive . 
  consider that for your average person , 160 $ is not a sum to be so easily discredited when the minimum salary is of 250 $ a month - a sum that could be very well be spent elsewhere , browsing through your shops , food , and what not . 
   how would you organize it ? 
  each member state provides a number of military personnel of a percentage proportional to that state 's active military ( say a third ) . 
  a joint fund made out of a fixed amount paid by each country for each military personnel deployed will be made for the training , arming , housing of those operatives . 
  also , fix a minimum number for each country in case they decide to train less military to reduce the number . 
  military operatives are sent on basis of public contest held by their native country ( best x out of whoever shows up and meets certain minimum qualifications ) . 
   would it be just cooperation between 28 different states or a single army ? 
  single army with major decisions ( military engagement ) made with a simple majority on behalf of the countries involved . 
  no countries to have the right to veto this process . 
   would national armies dissolve completely ? 
   how would you organize production and specialization of military equipment and military research for a federal army in various countries without destroying industries in some of them ? 
  exclusivity agreements for research and research-related equipment . 
   how would you handle favoritism and military lobbying by certain countries ? 
  by not giving them the right to veto any major decisions , setting strict rules on when and how we can decide to engage in military operations , the usual . 
   which of you would be comfortable paying tax to the eu to raise an army and dissolving most of your own armies we have shitloads of fucking taxes as is . 
  a standing army would be pointless and expensive at this point - unless there was a direct and serious military threat at our doorstep ( and no , i 'm not considering russia ) - we can solve our shit diplomatically . 
  the only way you could possibly justify such a thing would be in a context similar to what america is doing with ( or in ) other countries ( fighting for `` freedom and democracy '' ) . 
  ** however ** - considering europe is close to wherever europe/america would decide to send some thousands of tons of democracies exploding in their faces - we should take a step back , look at what happened with syria and realize we should n't shit where we eat anymore . 
  i actually did not know that - but i guess swamps , guerillas , drug traffickers and dangerous jungles still do n't count as `` drowning '' , so it could be worse lol . 
  my [ 2 cents ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kmcbdde.jpg ) on the subject . 
  ** translation here ** hungary is ready to immediately begin working on raising a barbed wire fence along its border with romania if migrants will begin transiting romania , declared the hungarian minister of external affairs peter szijjart on tuesday for reuters . 
  `` if we 'll have to build a fence there ( i.e. 
  at the romanian border ) , we will be ready to begin the second they decide to do so '' , said the hungarian official . 
  his statement came after the austrian minister of internal affairs , johanna mikl-leitner , announced on friday that austria will forbid migrants who would rather intend to transit towards germany instead of asking for an asylum there from entering its territory . 
  following that , slovenia immediately took a similar measure to prevent migrants from transiting its country . 
  these measures could potentially make romania a preferred route for the migrants who would attempt to further traverse hungary in their attempts to reach western europe , notes reuters . 
  presently , the migrants arriving in greece continue their journey on the balcanic route , traveling through macedonia , serbia , croatia , slovenia and austria , where they further proceed towards the western european states , particularly germany . 
  on the other hand , the chief of hungarian diplomacy suggested that the current plans of the eu to control the afflux of migrants who are still arriving in large numbers are unrealistic , requiring tens of thousands of police officers or soldiers to stop this wave of migrants in his opinion . 
  `` if it were n't a tragedy i would 've laughed hearing the european officials saying that a couple of hundred frontex officers would be the solution . 
  if greece does not wish to be part of this solution ( ... ) then we 'll have to discuss with the bulgarians and macedonians '' said szijjarto . 
  after hundreds of thousands of migrants from the middle east , africa and asia have crossed the hungarian territory last year , hungary secured its borders with serbia and croatia with the help of barbed wire fences and in september the few migrants which succeeded to cross these obstacles were arrested and prosecuted for illegally crossing the border . 
  the implementation of these fences was severly criticised by the eu despite the fact that slovenia and austria decided to build fences around their borders as well - although only with the purpose of controlling the incoming wave of migrants , not to stop it . 
  generally/stereotypically : hard working , punctual people . 
  a bit too fixated on certain matters for my taste sometimes . 
  very good engineering skills . 
  beer , sausages and wacken . 
  language sounds so brutal you can carve a functional volkswagen if you yell at a bunch of scrap metal in german long enough . 
  currently : same except merkel fucked up a bit with the refugee crysis . 
  would be silly to blame it on the german people - most of my german friends disagree with her . 
  amen . 
  ah man , where do i begin . 
  we had [ corneliu vadim tudor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_vadim_tudor ) , our very own right wing nationalist anti-semitic hungarian-hating nostalgic for communism , known for making obscene and outrageous statements on public television and [ putting up a show almost every time he was on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd_44kz4zfa ) . 
  on the bright side , he was a very knowledgeable man . 
  then there 's [ george becali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gigi_becali ) ( or gigi becali as most people refer to him ) known for his ownership of a popular soccer club as well as his outright stupidity . 
  he became rich after some shady business with the state . 
  he held extreme nationalistic views topped with an open support for far-right activists and `` the good old days '' of romania under nazi leadership - openly homophobic , xenophobic , antisemite and [ very vulgar towards news reporters and political opponents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsu7hjwvbs ) ( in this video he 's telling the reporters to write that `` his dick could break in two for all he cares about the dna = national anticorruption directorate ) . 
  his grammar and way of addressing others can only be compared to that of a redneck 4 ` th grader after failing his grade two years in a row . 
  he was also a devout christian . 
  we also had [ dan diaconescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_diaconescu ) , founder and head of two trash-tier tv channel where he held a talk-show almost 24/7 [ inviniting pseudo-celebrity nullities ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddhar9r7f9c ) to take part of and promoting stupid [ sensationalism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iszdttwxum ) . 
  his show became very popular in romania and decided to form his own party , the [ `` people 's party '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_party_%e2%80%93_dan_diaconescu ) - a very populist , short-sighted and far-leftist party , with a political platform revolving around demands such as : `` 20.000 euros to every citizen , confiscation of illicit wealth amounted by the rich in the past 20 years , founding of a people 's tribunal to urgently trial and condemn all those who have governed in the past 20 years '' etc. 
  he was arrested , sentenced to prison and his tv show 's license was revoked . 
  ** about the videos ** i am very confident that no prior knowledge of romanian is needed to admire and understand these works of art so feel free to give these videos a try and hope for some good laughs . 
  if you want more clarifications on any of the scenes or would like to see more coming from those politicians , feel free to ask !, 
  edit : forgot to mention the first two were members of the european parliament . 
  implying that hormone treatment , breast implants and operatively removed testicles single out just the transsexuals - as if a bodybuilder who shoots up testosterone , someone who had to undergo surgery for testicular cancer or any woman who 's ever had a breast implant operation is n't affected by this . 
  if there 's anything to object against it 's the criterias themselves - argue against why someone who takes testosterone injections or has had his testicles removed would be deemed unfit to be part of the police . 
  but saying `` oh , we feel this thing targets us and we feel bad about it so change it '' is just silly and ignorant . 
  courage to piss against the wind of propaganda and stand up for a balanced , rational approach over every issue . 
  courage to voice the concerns of others regardless of how irrational and illegitimate they might be so that they may be addressed and solved instead of shoved away in one extreme or the other to be poked at in stereotypical political terms . 
  courage to embrace divergent opinions through discussions and debates instead of labels and accusations . 
  intelligence to address issues before they reach a point of no return by thinking many steps ahead before implementing anything . 
  intelligence to acknowledge the problems we have objectively in abscence of bias and political pressure . 
  strength to establish democracy , equal rights , secularism , to answer for problems and mistakes before the people regardless of what consequences might follow . 
  strength to fight crime , corruption and terrorism without forsaking the rights and freedoms of its citizens . 
  strength to stand up for its culture , identity and future . 
  welcoming almost a milliong refugees against 48 % of your voter 's opinions , pushing for mandatory quotas for other countries to take them in as well with threats of economic sanctions , failing to reduce unemployment rates and so forth equates to `` moving to the left '' . 
  disagreeing with them means you 're a far right trumpist . 
  i enjoy reading unbiased opinions such as these . 
  people in romania are definitely split on anything that has to do with moldova . 
  on one side you have the populists , nationalists , mostly conservative ( and so forth ) who are all in for making moldova part of romania again , `` our brothers over prut '' sort of mentality . 
  on the other hand you have the people who do n't want anything to do with that russianized poor and corrupt ( more so than romania is ) country . 
  since we are part of nato and we have some american military operations going on here , we feel pretty safe that russia would n't attempt anything funny on romania 's territory . 
  however , if we were to decide for a military intervention in moldova against russia without the us 's backup we would be sending men for slaughter . 
  the fear of that conflict escalating to a full blown war probably would make the young people of the country emigrate even more than they are doing now . 
  if we 'd just sit quietly we 'd anger the populists who would also likely push for mandatory military training ( again ) and more military spending to get into a sort of bubble that we could hold out against the russians . 
  both cases considered are political suicides . 
  is there a way to get the transcript for this ? 
  pardon my french but i do n't understand a bloody thing . 
   he 's seen people staring at muslims like him `` a bit bizarrely '' everyone get ready to jump on the `` i 'm so offended , please kiss my ass otherwise you 're a racist '' bandwagon . 
   some muslims also feel the additional burden of having to justify and defend themselves and their community and point out their islam bears no relation to that of the violent zealots because ** islamic ** terrorism is almost just as often carried out by christians , hindus , atheists and so forth , right ? 
  silly paranoic french people , i wonder how they made the connection between ** islamic ** terrorism and the ** islamic ** religion . 
   `` with charlie , we were n't for a massacre , but it is true that we were n't too sorry . '', 
   but this time , muslim opposition to the bloodshed appears more universal . 
  the january gunmen specifically targeted journalists and jews . 
  the latest killers did n't care who they mowed down or what their victims believed . 
  that made them terrifying for everyone . 
  so you tend to care less about a tragedy when the issue itself sides against your religion because you feel it was justified and you care more about a tragedy when people of your religion also get killed because that is completely wrong . 
  okay , let me rephrase that : you 're not completely sorry about some people getting killed for insulting your ideology . 
  but you are completely sorry about some people getting killed when ( according to your claims ) that has nothing to do with your ideology . 
  and then you wonder why people have an issue with your ideology . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  i felt certain that turkey would not mind humanitarian effort and a chance to get off a significant portion of the refugees off their hands . 
  i seriously doubt turkey would be willing to take orders and directions from the eu as to how to handle its situation - which is n't the case here . 
  it should happen but i also doubt it will happen .
