  strictly speaking the only thing that turkey would need to provide is the same thing that it has been providing so far - a somewhat secure landmass outside the eu territory where the eu can set up emergency consulates and provide a bit of relief for the refugees . 
  agree , especially if you 're taking a hard language such as finnish . 
  my idea was for them to quickly learn the fundamentals of a language as fast as possible so they have the possibility of settling on their own and to make a fast sort of those who are unwilling to even put up with the very basics of integration . 
  if they are willing to learn then they will surely learn it in time . 
   the life and future of a syrian child are worth the same as the life and future of an hungarian child in principle , yes . 
  does your country pay child support / allowance / welfare or provide access to education , protection against abuse and discimination and so forth to each and every syrian child though ? 
  i understand and agree with the humanitarian perspective of it but from a political and economic stance - our own take priority over others . 
  we neither have the will nor resources with dealing with each and every single child in the world and that 's a fact . 
  that does ** not ** mean we have to be completely selfish in all regards . 
  it 's one thing to help ( which we can do for sure ) and another thing to open our borders , give them money , provide them with shelter , manage their integration , guard them as well as others against conflict ( which is bound to occur due to the cultural differences ) , find them jobs and so forth.heck , we ca n't even do that for many of our own citizens . 
   because any solution that involves controlling inner borders is an admission of defeat . 
  no , it 's a sane reaction against a real potential threat . 
  do you think that brushing it off and acting as if this action did not affect us will do any better ? 
  that 's like saying that you 'd gladly take another fist in the face if it means you wo n't have to attend a self-defence course in order to protect yourself next time that might happen and it 's insane . 
  especially due to the fact that this might not affect you but rather your friends , family , and so forth . 
   if the cost of freedom is a couple hundred dead every 7 years or so , i 'll gladly pay that price . 
  the laws themselves would barely affect you as an eu citizen . 
  i 'm not vouching for a big brother network - i truly believe that the issues we have which are already inside our borders should be treated differently . 
  saying `` i 'd rather have them kill us once in a while than change a couple of things '' is an admission of defeat . 
  oh , of course . 
  the measures would be in place for refugees only , i do n't believe that our freedoms should be restricted due to this situation . 
  perhaps i should 've specified that a border control inside the schengen area should be in place for a couple of months only to rally up the refugees who 've made it in . 
  afterwards , the outer schengen area should be guarded - much , much more than it is now - in order to prevent smugglers and illegals from entering . 
  maybe similar to how america handles its borders . 
  this would only be a measure of handling potential terrorists coming from outside . 
  to handle those that are already inside would involve too much loss of liberty on behalf of us . 
  if i decide tomorrow that i want to blow myself up for isis then there 's really nothing much any government can do about it , provided i 'm not stupid enough to google `` how to make a bomb and be cool like isis '' or something of the sort . 
  i personally agree , though perhaps your average superstitious romanian would disagree even with all the measures in place . 
  before you comment , consider my following stance on the subject : * i believe that europe is at war with isis * i believe there are realistic chances that isis might attempt to use the refugee crysis to commit acts of terrorism * i believe that the security of eu citizens is of utmost importance * i believe that we do not owe refugees anything and despite what you might think of my idea on how to handle the refugee crysis ( inb4 nazi , unfair , harsh , etc. ), 
  i would still consider these acts to be humanitarian and the conditions to be reasonable considering our current situation i apologize in advance for any inconsistencies you might find . 
  i did not spend more than 20 minutes thinking through these but i hope that you get the general outline of it . 
  ** step 1 ** close borders immediately in order to prepare implementing the plan . 
  ** step 2 ** organize a joint military force to secure the borders . 
  have two rows of defences - one to guard the interior borders ( austria , hungary , france , germany etc. ), 
  and one to guard the outer borders ( greece and italy ) . 
  for the refugees who are already inside - immediately set up refugee homes just outside the interior borders which will be supervised by local police and proceed to displace them there . 
  offer them the possibility of going back to turkey/home if they so desire running buses/trains on a weekly basis which will also be escorted by the military to ensure a proper delivery . 
  on the outside borders of europe , send them back without question . 
  ** step 3 ** set up emergency consulates in turkey/neighboring countries for the refugees . 
  these should function as places where refugees may apply for visa to the eu/refugee status without having to step on european soil . 
  change legislation accordingly . 
  ** step 4 ** establish a plan to cooperate with turkey on the humanitarian effort . 
  provide refugees with housing , food , medicine and whatever they may need for the duration of processing requests . 
  the same will be done with the camps set off on the outskirts of these interior borders as well . 
  ** step 5 ** process the requests by making a thorough examination of each candidate and grant access only to those who meet the following conditions : * they have realistic chances of integrating within the eu territory this includes : basic education ( an educational evaluation provided in their own language if they lack the papers to testify for it ) , tolerance for other genders , minorities and religions ( a psychological evaluation is in order ) , will to work and achieve integration ( another psychological evaluation ) , ability to speak a european language is a plus . 
  * they have no connection with islamist terrorist groups beyond all reasonable doubt this includes a thorough background check on relatives as well as private e-mails , phone records , messages and such . 
  put them to swear an oath on the quran that they 're not if you have to . 
  i know that they can bypass all these methods if they 're smart enough but it 's the least we can do . 
  * they agree to be subjected to special procedures which will apply to them due to current conflictual conditions and we refer to these special procedures in a bit . 
  if an application is accepted , a series of special procedures will be applied to the residents . 
  each country will put up a number of refugees it is willing to take free from obligation from the other states . 
  the residents will have the option of choosing which countries they wish to be part of provided there are still available places at the time . 
  the spots will be awarded in chronological order with no particular priority . 
  the residents will ** not ** benefit from the country 's current welfare system what so ever . 
  instead , a collective fund will be raised in which every country of the eu will have to contribute equally repsective to its population/gdp . 
  this funding will cover for the following costs : * qualification courses of 1 year for entry-level jobs with the possibility of extending for up to 1-2 years based on performance in order to earn a degree * language courses ( 1 year ) of the hosting country 's respective native language * housing , food , clothes , sanitation , internet etc. 
  * monthly allowance ( equal regardless of country ) provided they attend these courses * a place of worship * creating job opportunities for them the ** special conditions ** which will apply to them will be the following : * they will not have the right to settle in a different country/place for an indefinite amount of time ( until the isis threat is resolved to say the least ) * they will be subjected to strict telecommunication monitorization for an indefinite amount of time ( to prevent contact with isis ) * a special police unit will patrol to area and whereabouts for an indefinite amount of time * residents will be subjected to the same laws which apply to the country of residence ; patrol will have the right to conduct body seaches and account for any missing residents * any misdemeanor as well as conduct which violates the rights of other minorities , genders , religious groups etc. 
  will be noted upon each and every single one 's file ; serious offences proven in court may instantly grant the hosting country the right to the declare the offenders as `` persona non grata '' and send them back to turkey * failure to complete the language course will grant the country the right to send them back * serious violations of the law acomplish the same * contact or suspicious activities over the internet acomplish the same * any suspicious activity which might point towards a terrorist attack will be investigated - if found guilty , acomplishes the same * any acquisition of a telecommunication device without informing authorities about it acomplishes the same if these issues are resolved , the residents will have to apply in order to settle in a different area provided they have completed their language course and acquired a job . 
  the monthly allowance will be deducted from the rent for another year in order to allow for a better accomodation . 
  strict surveillance will be maintained however as well as all the clauses which might earn them a ticket back to turkey for at least 10 years . 
  the blood is on the hands of all those liberals who have welcomed them into europe , [ despite the fact that we were warned even by isis that this would happen ] ( http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/isis-smuggler-we-will-use-refugee-crisis-to-infiltrate-west/ ) , despite the fact that the media kept reporting it [ over ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/11863978/europe-is-at-risk-from-incredibly-cruel-isil-warns-pope-francis.html ) and [ over ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/islamic-state-isis-smuggler-thousands-extremists-into-europe-refugees ) again . 
  i doubt anyone will ever hold them responsible . 
  if anything , they 'll lobby for taking in even more refugees . 
  i can already see it :  if we do n't take in more refugees , the terrorists win  the terrorists want us to hate them so we have to love them  they 're going through this every day in syria , europe has a moral obligation to take them in and so forth . 
  i can only wonder what it would take to put some sense into these people . 
  it is a sad thing that many people had to die to prove that the right wing has a point - and seeing how awful the leftists are at managing this situation , europe will have no other sane choice but to vote for the right and gods know where that could take us . 
   any society has some cultural rules about clothing . 
  the reason why you can not be naked in the street has to do with indecency or maintaining public order . 
  but things like bringing an even number of flowers to a girl ( in my country , an even number of flowers is only brought at funerals ) or using the wrong kind of fork at the table may be wrong , but should n't be punishable by law . 
   in most of the western countries , it is not acceptable to promote your religion in public . 
  a burqa does not , in any way , support or actively encourage islam to other citizens no more than a jewish hat , a sikh turban , a catholic cross and so forth do so for their respective religions . 
  jehovah 's witnesses will actually and actively promote their religion and as far as i know , they are legal in both germany and france . 
  it just seems to me that islam is being singled out not because of any objective consideration ( because it 's actively promoting religion and that is illegal , because wearing religious clothing means promoting a religion etc. 
  ) , but because a lot of people hate it . 
   in western countries , the women rights are very important because there are considered equals as men [ ... ] women have to prove this is their choice . 
  up to know we mainly only see man defending them i wholeheartedly agree , which is why i think a law banning burqas is n't the way to go . 
  forbidding it on children/teenagers until they reach the age of adulthood and are capable of deciding for themselves , protecting children and adults from familial repercussions , providing counselling and so forth - with those i can agree . 
  but it 's hilarious to me to say we 're giving women freedom to wear whatever they want by telling them what they ca n't wear in public . 
  how can you be certain that is true and why should it be up to you to decide what is and is n't a choice when it comes to someone else 's religious expression ? 
  if a woman wants to have sex but does n't because she 's been indoctrinated since birth that premarital sex is wrong , sinful and so forth - should the state step in and force her to have sex because that 's what non-brainwashed atheists generally do ? 
  i do n't even know where to begin with these arguments . 
   it shows that an open society will not accept just anything . 
  an open society is n't synonymous with an anarchic society . 
  in other words , just because you live in a free society does n't mean you have to accept everything . 
  that 's why you have laws and special places where you send people who break those laws !, 
   it shows that the liberal constitutional state is resolved to take steps against the enemies of liberality . 
  how exactly is the burqa an enemy of liberality if a woman willingly chooses to wear it ? 
  how dare you imply that after admitting in the premise of your argument that `` yes [ ... ] the mere fact of contemplating a burqa ban is a sign of illiberality '' ? 
   the burqa is not a sign of religious life , or even religiosity ; otherwise , women from morocco to pakistan would all wear the burqa . 
  they do not , although the moroccans are just as religious as the libyans , egyptians , iranians , or pakistanis . 
  wearing a cross is not a sign of religiosity ; otherwise , every christian would wear one . 
  therefore , banning people from wearing the cross is not an oppressive act targeting a religious group in particular because the act itself is n't religious because christians do n't have to be able to wear crosses in order to be christians . 
  try and think for a moment how stupid that argument sounds and listen to yourself again . 
   does it include also the mutilation of young girls in islamic countries ? 
  the man 's violent dominion over the woman ? 
  the total lack of self-determination for women ? 
  are we acquiescing to all this just because we want to be religiously tolerant ? 
  you 're completely ignoring the fact that there is legislation to combat every single point there , yet you still assert that if we allow burqas today , we might as well allow child molestation tomorrow because what the fuck is the difference , right ? 
  since there have to be limits in every society , let 's ignore the fact that we 've already drawn them and show them we mean business ; soon enough , all the other states will follow and everyone will be banning burqas to combat domestic violence - the same way banning catholic prayer will prevent child molestation ( we all know prayer leads to church and church is where the pedophiles are ) or banning statue nudity will reduce the incidence of rape ( perverts wo n't be triggered by stone tits anymore ) . 
  brilliant !,
