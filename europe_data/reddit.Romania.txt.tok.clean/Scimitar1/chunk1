professional radios are not designed for you to get on instagram or play 2048 . 
  they 're huge and bulky because they have big-ass batteries , big transponders , geographic coverage that 's like 10x your average gsm signal . 
  the cases are also made to withstand water pressure and explosions and shit . 
  you do n't have time to mess with a touch screen if you 're a fire fighter . 
  also end to end encryption and relatively simple circuit boards . 
  why do you have to get so defensive ? 
  i have n't noticed anything like what you 're whining about ( except the usual snide hungarian remarks ) . 
  to me this subreddit feels surprisingly nondiscriminatory and positive-minded in regards to eastern europe . 
  who the fuck wants oter countries to catch up ? 
  that 's a recipe for conflict . 
  the biggest problem with western mentalty today is that people are comfortable with superiotiy when we should be aiming for euroamerican supremacy . 
  not everyone can mobilize the manpower of the united states . 
  not everyone borders russia . 
  no , because we 're not all wothless hippies . 
  some of us take civic duties seriously . 
  and i 'm sure those women will , especially when it comes to the security of such a wonderful country like norway . 
  get the fuck back to tumblr . 
  i 'm glad to see feminist politicians staying true to the basis of feminism : gender equality . 
  30 % more fat on average wo n't make a lot of practical difference in a modern military that has a lot of other imperatives besides raw physique necessary in combat and long-term maneuvering . 
  and i 'm sure women are just as capable in every way . 
  and do n't tell me about institutionalized opression in the western world . . in fucking scandinavia . 
  russia could be a normal , stable and mature nation that is n't upsetting european security and territorial stability while being a constructive member of the international community . 
  and it was so for a significant time . 
  instead i am watching putin waste over a decade of potential and running russia into the ground for an outdated concept that no longer exists of dominating the so-called `` near abroad '' and i feel like that is an endemic problem of the russian mentality , not just their political class . 
  those with soviet ideals need to understand that 's a lost war , and with every additional `` battle '' , they stand only to lose more . 
  ukraine is now ireedimably anti-russian . 
  sevastopol is nice , but they could have kept leasing that . 
  i have no idea why this is still going on . 
  maybe it 's like most people are saying : just an attempt to solidify putin and co 's grip on internal power . 
  who cares ? 
  what is this obsession with form over substance ? 
  hard truths like these need to be expressed more often . 
  oh noes , recognizing the superiority of the american recovery measures . 
  quick , got ta shower him with downvotes before anyone reads . 
  fookin legends of gin alley, 
  no , just because you are a marxist with the intellectual depth carved by a few videos from cgpgrey . 
  * a blatant agenda does n't warrant a closer look at the facts ? 
  * * the soros foundation does n't have any initiatives worth supporting ? 
  ( such as their activism for marriage equality ? 
  ) * not that a number on some profile matters , but it says a lot about the thought processes of some people ( here : you ) . 
  i suppose it 's easier to silence those with dissenting opinions , but downvotes are meant for those insult or are uncivil . 
  it 's actually for real this time . 
  and there 's no reason to demonize that fact ; i support a lot of initiatives of the soros foundation . 
  i just think a blatant agenda warrants a closer look at the facts , and as it stands out , these guys are complete liars on this issue ( criticatac.ro in general ), 
  read my other reply . 
  it 's kind of true . 
  it 's not a widespread conspiracy or anything of the sort , but yes - those think thanks are , if not direct russian agents , working for russian pr . 
  ** environmental concerns are rarely ever brought up , just the appeal to anti-american sentiment . 
  seriously , just ignore this publication . 
  they 're a romanian think thank funded by soros to support far-leftists ( sounds pretty archetypical , but it 's true ) . 
  it 's mostly full of communist nostalgics , but it does n't hurt to spice it up with some anti-americanism . 
  there is an `` anti-fracking day '' that they 're trying to make happen , but it keeps not happening . 
  about 30 people showed up in romania judging by their pics , so i guess if it 's 50 in bulgaria then it 's large scale . 
  anything goes as long as russian interests are represented . 
  russia today is pretty reasonable by comparison ( just read some random articles ) ... because energy collaboration with america is the real threat eastern europeans face . 
  their chief editor , vasile ernu is a ussr-born and self-described soviet , regularly lobbying against moldova 's entry in the european union . 
  they literally believe [ moldova ** and romania ** ] ( http://www.criticatac.ro/19843/de-ce-romania-republica-moldova-sint-state-artificiale-cint-va-exploda-bomba-social-europa-interviu-cu-vasile-ernu/ ) are artificial states , prophesizing a breakdown of social order in europe so we could further integrate `` east '' . 
  [ and it 's the same thinking that freed my country from the communist scourge . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1989 ) anything goes when you have to get rid of marxists . 
  it 's an unfortunate reality . 
  maybe if filthy nationalists/leftits would n't have interfered with their benefactors , the transition would be peaceful . 
  wherever it was peaceful , it meant economic development , integration with the world financial markets and individual freedom for citizens . 
  and in many places where it was n't peaceful , it still led to positive results . 
  i do agree it 's something extreme and should n't be taken lightly , but it should be considered an option . 
  in fact , it already is . 
  denmark and nl have nato nukes although not operationally controlled by their homeland militaries . 
  poland and romania are not dangerous borders . 
  and to your last point : russia ** seems ** at least presently to be a rational actor guided by relative interests ( unlike , say , middle eastern theocracies ) and as such , we have to show that it 's not in russia 's interest to incurr the wrath of euroatlantic alliances . 
  we have to stop treating russia with diplomatic gloves , so to say . 
  they 're not some failed state , plagued by division where ultranationalist reactionaries could be at least excused . 
  they 're not in some financial collapse that would warrant the return to their empire . 
  everything was going fine between us/eu-russia , diplomatically and economically before it decided that ukrainian self-determination is not something they can abide by . 
  so let 's roll over and allow external threats to erode western civilzation , because that will de-escalate things . . right ? 
  oh lookie where the marxist from the other thread was . 
  such cultural relativism . 
  so much inclusion . 
  reading your comments just solidifies my certainty that the extreme left is naturally racist , but they just internalized it . 
  [ not resentment per se ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ressentiment ) do n't worry , you 'll grow up and realize the reason your life sucks is not because of any system , but because you are worthless . 
  yes , i do n't see how anyone could be `` against '' the only entity that guarantees world peace . 
  it 's rational to criticize means and policies , of course , but anti-americanism is just leftist envy and ressentim\u00e8nt . 
  `` they are acting like the third reich '' i stopped there . 
  your hormones and emotions will subside and you will probably have a rational viewpoint when you grow up , but for now it 's just all anti-american dribble . 
  they should never have rebuilt your country . 
  there 's too many anti-western , eurosceptic subs , because this is reddit and nobody is rational . 
  which one do you mean ? 
  why wo n't nato do the same in eastern europe ? 
  i 'd be happy to host anything that keeps the russian expansion in check . 
  why bother with icmbs or sicmb when tactical warheads are much more effective ? 
  stop debating with insane pro-russians . 
  seriously , it 's a mental condition . 
  would you spend so much time on a holocaust denialist ? 
  that is just how anti-americans think . 
  it 's not hyperbolic . 
  what reformists dude ? 
  have you been to / r/russia ? 
  and these are russian ** redditors ** . 
  some programmes got better absorbtion ( regio ) while others remained plagued by the same bullshit ( posdru ) . 
  but yes , i agree i was harsh with my judgement of psd . 
  there 's a lot of competent people in there right now , and there were also a lot of awful ones during pdl times . 
  i was quoting the article , trying to sarcastic : (,
