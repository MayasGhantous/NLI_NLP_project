  and i am of the same opinion about my gypsy co-nationals flooding western europe not for lawful employment , but for petty crime . 
  you hungarian bros hurry up with that fence . 
  now please show me legal distinctions between private and personal property in the developed world . 
  there actually are , but they are pretty subtle because the line is getting more blurred by the day . 
  such is the nature of supply and demand economics ( aka . 
  what empirically works , as opposed to fantasy ) . 
  thanks for reminding me there are people in the developed world still arguing against private property . 
  i 'm sure you will be taken seriously if you ever attempt to elaborate legislation . 
  no worries , they are already brigading this thread . 
  you should n't be calling them 13 year old though , that 's pretty shit . 
  there is absolutely no chance a reddit thread on a minor subreddit will change greece 's situation for better or worse . 
  the communist elements in their parliament though - that is an issue . 
  let them . 
  let them crash and burn , for the whole world to see what happens when marxists are elected in governance . 
  europe will fall behind with more dead weight anyway . 
  in the unlikelihood that happens , i will only be sorry for the greek people , the general population , as i 'm sure they are more interested in their livelihoods than marxist dreams of utopia . 
  why do n't you make a better life for yourself then ? 
  read statistics about upwards social mobility , watch a shia labouf motivational video , realize you are a failure and only then you will be on the road of personal responsability and material achievement . 
  or you could continue being a failure and hoping a revolutionary utopia will hand you everything . 
  and do n't forget , if you fail , it 's not your fault . 
  you did everything right , to the best of your abilities . 
  the blame is on the banks \u2122 . 
  i could talk to you for a while about engel 's law of transformation , althusser 's hegemony , or a myriad of dialectic materialist concepts . 
  also i believe these marxist ideas have merit and applicability . 
  the problem is , you 're on reddit , and you will probably treat it as your religion . 
  no discourse can be had with such people , and i 've taken too many chances already . 
  people who use the word `` neoliberal '' generally have little education in finance , business , macroeconomy or law . 
  as a law student who will soon be part of a masters ' program at a faculty you probably heard of , i can assure you `` neoliberalism '' is a bit of a joke in academia . 
  people who whine about `` neoliberalism '' , employing pretty-colored infographs rather than documents and statistics are simply desperate . 
  desperate because they missed their chance at unrest since the economic crisis . 
  they are hanging onto every thread of financial misfortune in europe ( and the western world in general ) , because they realize most nations are returning to normal economic growth . 
  greece has been taken captive by such populists and their agendas . 
  and i 'm not talking of syriza at large and mr. tsipras whom i have respect for ( and believed in ) , just the extreme elements in their coalition - who destroyed the chance for a better deal for greece . 
  i could replace `` they '' with `` you '' but i 'd rather not be vindictive . 
  i 've met reasonable anarchists ( albeit few ) . 
  to people in r/socialism , if you simply believe in property ( an established human right ) , you will be classified as a right-wing nut . 
   anarchism are you of legal drinking age ? 
  it 's okay , we 've all had our phases . 
  have you people noticed the stuff that 's upvoted on / r/socialism ? 
  ( from the other top story about greece ) . 
  * '' & gt ; should the ~ ~ left platform ~ ~ greek people support tsipras and syriza in power - or ~ ~ vote against him and risk a `` coup '' by the reactionaries and put nd in power ? ~ ~ burn the old royal palace that contains parliament down with those idiots in it ? 
  '' * you can not reason with these people . 
  they are the reason the situation got much worse for the greek people in the past weeks . 
  it 's become quite clear that a reasonable leftist social democrat like mr. tsipras got held hostage by the extremist wing in his party ( skourletis and dragasakis , among others in the coalition ) . 
  and to what end ? 
  the insitutions ' trust in the greek government is at the lowest point , and this will not benefit the greek people . 
  yet , they want more of the same . 
  i 'm currently being brigaded by commies after an argument ( including comments in romanian that they ca n't understand ) so this will probably never be visible . 
  ** do not attempt to reason with marxists ** . 
  their worldview is similar to racism , men 's rights , modern feminism , political islam , islamophobia . 
  it 's not about the welfare of the society , `` the greater good '' or anything like that - it 's simply identity politics , of groups wanting to maintain their privileges or acquire more , leeching on others . 
  it is a sign of immaturity to believe in childish marxist revolutions ( speaking as someone who shares a lot of views with social democrats ) . 
  that kind of stuff ended in the 90s . 
  and this subreddit is pretty ideologically balanced . 
  see my other reply . 
  or just compare it with . . eww ... / r/politics or , at the other extreme , r/ukpolitics . 
  but they all pale in comparison to r/socialism , which is / r/conspiracy tier . 
  some people are saying this subreddit is `` right wing '' which honestly is pretty inaccurate . 
  as a rather centrist person who 's spent some time here , this to me seems like one of the most ideologically balanced large subreddits . 
  have you not noticed the shift from in what 's generally upvoted ? 
  when mr. tsipras rejected the ( much lighter ) eurogroup measures and proposed a referedum , the sway in what was upvoted was generally tending to be less sympathetic to the greek cause . 
  after mr. tsipras and his delegation suddenly showed themselves as willing to compromise ( probably finally facing the reality of what they would be facing on the background of the banking crisis ) , and the european instituions acted needlessly harsh in negotiations , most prevalent opinions here were empathetic towards the greek people . 
  i rather changed my view too . 
  ** most people would disagree , because they tend to always notice those who do n't share their worldview more stridently . 
  but really , the large proportion of the discussion here feels very reasonable and balanced , with extremist outliers , of course , like in every medium ever . . ** compare r/europe to ... ugh ... r/politics . 
  or if you prefer the other end of the spectrum , r/ukpolitics . 
  because that is the worst imaginable realistic scenario ? 
  everyone talking about the potential for growth on medium term in case of a grexit are only taking into consideration the most positive , rianbows-and-unicorns progressions of events possible . 
  you do n't need anything more than a skull that 's not empty to recognize that the statement `` greece will eventually go bankrupt '' is inane . 
  i would enlist if the baltics were threatened and open military conflict begun . 
  the problem today is that there is no balance , no middle ground between the fervor of nationalism and the complete apathy of overeducated youths . 
  we need loyalty to the institutions that defend us , such as nato . 
  the enemy possess that to a much larger extent . 
  ** `` first they came for the socialists , and i did not speak out ... '' **, 
  on tuesday ? 
  varoufakis + predictions makes for a great source of kek . 
  more marxist bullshit for simple minds . 
  now you can be mislead with easy to digest , pretty-colored infographics . 
  because who needs primary sources , or actually reading documents ? 
  shut up with this `` eventually greece will go bankrupt '' . 
  that is much closer to `` extremely unlikely '' than `` foregone conclusion '' . 
  i 'm tired of simple minded scrubs like you taking simplistic anti-stances ( either anti-greece or anti-europe ) to validate their worldview . 
  of course , without any knowledge of finance or macroeconomy . 
  no , the rest is not `` theater '' . 
  it 's the confrontation and/or collaboration of many different parties with many diverging interests ; the difference is , elected officials at eurogroup meetings are backed by or are themselves experts in these fields . 
  economy might be a fickle thing to predict ; though their insight and debates certainly outclass redditors ( and even american academics ) in applicability . 
  ** stop saying `` greece will eventually go bankrupt '' . 
  just stop . 
  repeating it , foaming at the mouth with anti-eu fervor will not make something that nobody wants to happen , happen . 
  ** i rather believed it too , for a few days , when the referendum was announced as i thought the marxist wing of syriza was holding the rest of the social democrats in the party hostage , though it does n't appear to be true to such an extent . 
  damage was still done though . 
  tsipras and greece by extension would have been in a much better negotiating position if they did n't give in to skourletis ' , dragasakis ' , etc dreams of imposing terms on europe without having much real leverage . 
  they still managed to secure a haircut , the new bailout is pretty large , the newly acquired debt is under negligible interest , and the privatization of assets , along with the fiscal reform ( i pray to god they manage to implement it ) have a realistic chance of putting greece on the right track . 
  tom cruise . 
  the mass of undecideds is much lower when it comes to the brexit question .

  88 % the banks !, 
  greece needs no responsability .
