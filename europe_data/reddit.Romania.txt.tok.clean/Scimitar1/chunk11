  88 % just like glorious iceland \u2122, 
  i did n't mean we would contribute to bailouts now , of course . 
  it still sets a bad precedent if lithuanian taxpayers have to contribute to helping pigs out of failure . 
  mostly i was addressing the retarded term `` satellite '', 
  nobody gives a flying fuck about germany when it comes to eu council decisions . 
  there 's a lot of romanian mps , for example , who are n't epps and take very anti-merkel stances . 
  it 's about what 's fair . 
  and it 's not fair we should bail out others ' financial irresponsability when we had to go through austerity as poorer countries . 
  so , being a reactionary is not a sound basis towards forming a political belief ? 
  that 's how it 's happening with me . 
  they will not tolerate more greek shenanigans because the country is too indebted , has been so for ** decades ** before joining the eu . 
  the euro and the ez financial insitutions just kept it afloat ( still keeping greeks living beyond their means ) for a decade or so more . 
  plus , i just think showing the world what happens when populations elect marxists sets a good example . 
  maybe you have the luxury to spend your own taxpayer money on greece , most of europe does n't and does n't want to . 
  those resources would be much better employed continuing to structurally develop financially and politically stable countries like poland , romania , the baltics , bulgaria , hungary . 
  from which you get return on investment and which you do n't have to bailout because we did n't livee beyond our means , incurring a shitload of debt . 
  except , the big rich countries constantly have inferior economic growths and more debt-tp-gdp ratio and they also are net contributors to the european budget ... unlike romania , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , the baltics and poland . 
  democracy does not rely ever on public opinion , in no legal theory ever . 
  the european electorate is reasonable and there 's no reason their comfort and needs should be less important than that of greeks . 
  but for die linke drones like you , anything that hurts european union is good . 
  preferably greece aligning away from nato geostrategically too . 
  fucking absolutely . 
  they see everything as class warfare , they 've made up their mind about `` how history works '' , exactly according to how daddy marx told them . 
  and then they laugh at christians ' about believing what they 've made up for so many centuries ( speaking as just as a cultural christian ) . 
  they 're really keen too , even when failing . 
  but you still got ta help them out fail a little less ... 
  no other small country incurred such a gigantic amount of debt over so many decades . 
  it would be worse for the euro , in my opinion , if greece were to stay . 
  the euro was not greece 's problem - and in fact , being integrated with eu financial institutions it 's what kept it alive ** in spite of ** the enormous sovereign debt . 
  there is no debate . 
  austerity is not a policy in a classical sense . 
  first you run out of money , then you run out of other people 's money . 
  and heck , i am even for restructuring a large portion of greek debt as i believe in an united europe . 
  that simply can not happen without real reforms . 
  there was no strawman . 
  saying anything that shifts the blame from greece like `` it has cut itself to the bone , and there is nothing to be cut '' ( realistically , there is actually a lot to be cut ) is really just encouraging more financial irresponsability . 
  go back to the latrine that is / r/politics and suck bernie sanders ' socialist dick like all good pinko americans . 
  keep your chin up and keep encouraging that greeks continue to live through other people 's money , as they have since the 80s . 
  greece has cut itself to living in its means , as opposed to beyond them in an inflated credit bubble . 
  and ? 
  super awesome . 
  we have a small muslim minority , but it 's been consistently part of our nation for hundreds of years and endured a lot of communist persecution . 
  i see no problem with this . 
  i do n't think there 's any place for political islam in europe , but freedom of religion is fundamental and i think romania ( even with a very pro-european population ) lacks the cultural diversity to integrate properly . 
  i want to see this happen . 
  he was precisely elected to sign this . 
  this populist bullshit is just another way to shift more of the blame ** and the burden ** on the eu . 
  sacrifices have to be made in order to establish a world order of western values . 
  to make an omelette , you have to kill a few civillians . 
  there is no indication whatsoever any of the air raids on belgrade targetted civillians - they were unfortunate casualties . 
  no , i meant just as in rightful . 
  and there are rightful military interventions . 
  international law also says you ca n't commit ethnic cleansing , and there are just wars . 
  `` because you want to '' is a very simplistic and intellectually dishonest way to look at it . 
  it 's impossible to show solidarity to extremists . 
  i can only interpret tsipras ' actions as a plan to leave the eu and set up a communist state . 
  which will probably be eurasian-aligned rather than western aligned . 
  him and his lackeys have done absolutely everything in their power to make sure nobody would feel any sympathy for greeks . 
  representing . 
  one of those in bucharest is me . 
  you ca n't befriend romanian furries because there 's like 10 of them . 
  i really fucked up this time ... 
  drone strikes are precise and efficient , and they yield many less civillian casualties than conventional warfare , even infantry special operations . 
  terrorist combatants need to be annihilated , and many people in those countries are grateful ( see jordan and to some extent , yemen - they are the most likely to suffer from the plague that is salafism ) also , bush , cheney , petraeus and co. were unwilling to employ as many drones in theaters because amphibious assault and all out war are much better for the military corporations that are basically owned by their families . 
  the situation has changed drastically in the past 10 years in regards to american military doctrine and administration , an you ca n't keep saying the same decade-outdated leftist platitudes even if it 's reddit . 
  but of course , it 's very simple to see the world through your eyes and i do n't blame you for being intellectualy comfortable . 
  usa did not start any war in vietnam ( and you 're 50 years late ) . 
  the iraqi invasion was a follow up on an un sanctioned deposition of a ( genocidal ) head of state , and afghanistan contained breeding grounds for a lot of terrorist organizations that had to be annihilated , and they mostly have been . 
  none of the above have anything to do with the arab spring , which is the cause for most of the refugee flight . 
  it 's a multi-national ongoing event with multiple , complex causes , though if you would read up on events in tunisia , libya and syria , the situation in the past 4 years has mostly been caused by popular movements ( ethnic or sectarian ) and very little by any outside intervention . 
  you ca n't just blame everything on the us because you 're a sheltered scandinavian with a superiority complex that does n't understand the world outside their bubble . 
  not even because some redneck retarded fuck said refugees should be shot . 
   usa starts wars in vietnam , iraq and afganistan and europe has to take in the refugees who flee for their lives ? 
  did you even stop for a second and tried to comprehend how moronic that statement is ? 
  i know this is r/europe , and anything bashing the us goes without scrutiny , but come on ... 
  stop being a fascist fucking scum . 
  ** in a comment above you said they should be `` shot '' ** . 
  i do agree this current state of affairs regarding immigration , and european policy in general , are beyond lenient ; but it does n't mean we have to fall to the other extreme . 
  what do you mean `` what a surprise '' ? 
  american federal policy is almost identical when it comes to refugees , and immigration in general ( though , of course , harsher on work permits , and many fewer countries have visas for us ) - despite what you might have been led to believe . 
  the implementation of it is serious though ( i 'll take the us coast guard over any european one ) . 
  the american public also is much less racist than the average western european group mentality . 
  sure , the guy you replied to is a piece of shit human filth emptyskull , but it it ** is ** a bit surprising he 's american . 
  very nice visuals , great angles and such . 
  brasov really looks that good . 
  but damn that narration is cringy as fuck . 
  stand up to the eu and what ? 
  threaten with the kremlin more ? 
  call merkel a nazi more ? 
  greece simply does n't have the power to impose terms in this debate , and it 's by your own doing . 
  default simply is worse than real reform . 
  the sooner you face that fact the better for everyone . 
  who in their right mind fears that ? 
  how about we split romania too , cause we were fascist expansionists ages ago . 
  or japan . 
  i 'm sorry , i think what you said is most likely sarcasm . 
  nobody lied about anything ; you 're just drawing the conclusions you like to believe from some data that does n't sustain them . 
  it is completely and utterly false , to the point of being an outright lie ( i 'm a party member , check my reply below - but i 'm sure you could google party statues and organizations yourself ), 
  that 's such fucking bullshit . 
  i am a member of a large parties ' students ' chapter .
