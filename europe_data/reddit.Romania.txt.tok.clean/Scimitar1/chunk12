  there is no such thing in any of the top parties . 
  there are special women 's wings ** specifically to empower women in politics ** , and they 're only for women and women 's initiatives , and that 's very good because women do n't get into politics enough . 
  the selection process for party positions in ** all big parties ** ( sorry , i do n't know shit about how it works in prm ) is done at a county level - of course , through the good ol' romanian way of money and networking - but not from particular organizations within the parties . 
  and there 's not only wings for women , but for other groups too ( such as ethnic minorities ) . 
  gender does n't exist in any parties ' statute , or any administrative documents . 
  it 's god damn 2015 . 
  romanian law makes it literally impossible to establish a party that would have that , or any discrimination ( with the exception for parties that represent ethnic minorities ) this crazy fuck is literally saying our parties ' are segregated to push his agenda . 
  again , i have to say : i really hate using some men 's rights rhetoric because i really abhorr those guys , but that 's how it is . 
  complete institutional , legal and maybe even cultural gender equality ( the last one takes a lot of time and very few national cultures have reached that level of progress unfortunately ) . 
  complete gender equality in that reductionist sense feminists always describe the concept as , would exist only when we 're not a gender dimorphic species anymore . 
  god i hate using some men 's rights rhetoric because i really abhorr those guys , but that 's how it is . 
  natalie kitroeff is a feminist ideologue ( just check her tweets ) . 
  nothing in that study with mba graduates makes any reference to positions post-ed , and there 's nothing that ca n't be explained by the fact women work less hours . 
  by occam 's razor , women 's career choices explain the gap exhaustively and any deviation from that fact is cherry-picking some ( in the case of those studies on very small samples ) very dubious data to push more socialist/identity-politics agendas at the expense of the free market . 
  yes , take on the international corporation and win . 
  there 's countless examples . 
  romanians just do n't have a proper litigious culture . 
  do n't blame that on capitalism . 
  sovereign , independent nations are imagined communities too . 
  i do n't understand what was your point , although the concept is very relevant to this debate and not often enough brought up . 
  obviously i did n't mean french and german ** literal ** institutional leadership . 
  are you fucking crazy ? 
  i , and obviously nobody , would give up any sovereignity for french and german interests ( but yes for pan-european ones ) . 
  i meant it more in terms political project and mediatic/cultural leadership . 
  it was more as a reaction to all the nordic hipstering about germany 's `` iron grip '' on eu politics in this thread . 
  strong political forces for federalization can come from cyprus or hungary for all i care ; as long as they 're committed to this ideal , i will support them . 
  who gives a shit that women are underrepresented ? 
  why is nobody crying that men are under represented in education or ( in romania ) law ? 
  everybody should just act as if people do n't follow career paths based on millions of genetic and environmental factors that dictate their growth as a person , one of which is gender . 
  i 'm not some crazy men 's rights advocate . 
  most of the world is institutionally mysoginistic , but not the west . 
  any kind of gender politicking is retarded . 
  maybe women should be encouraged to get involved in less shit fields ( like humanities ) , but dictating some quotas to employers ( you have to hire x number of [ insert whatever group here ] ) is unreasonable . 
  maybe more women should be candidates ? 
  just like with the wage gap bullshit , maybe women should stop studying useless stuff like humanities ( do n't pick on me , i 'm studying humanities too ) and instead get into stem or become entrepreneurs ? 
  nobody ever brings this fact up here . 
  complete gender equality is a thing since early communist times ( they had one good idea ) , culturally too . 
  actually a very large proportion of magistrates ( judges and prosecutors ) are women here , significantly more than men - and generally more of everyone involved in the judicial branch . 
  there 's more male defense lawyers though . 
  i wo n't deny , it 's a little bit satisfying to see gym rat mrs kovesi drag all these fat corrupts through courts though . 
  but they definitely are n't brave because they 're women . 
  does it ever occur to you how trite it is to describe anything as `` orwellian '' in 2015 ? 
  i swear , there needs to be a godwin 's law for this innanity . 
  basically anything any hipster disgarees with , no matter the political spectrum of the idea or concept , is branded as orwellian or fascist . 
  it 's just hard to take seriously and from my experience , it 's oftentimes a joke subject in law/poliscience academia . 
  here , more statements you 'll enjoy . 
  i really love how despite the fact extremist far-right/left movements have some popular support in europe , they never manage to properly attain political power . 
  conservatives and liberals will always prevail owed to smart legislation ( such as first-past-the-post and gerrymandering in general ) that prevents the represenation of extremists . 
  democracy should only be for the reasonable . 
  farage farage rule britannia ... with one mp seat though : (, 
  i really like poland , polish culture and history and mentality ( except for the xenophobia ) . 
  romanians and romanian media have a very positive opinion of poland and it 's a bit of a post-commie model country for us ( what could have been us if we had balcerowicz and not iliescu , etc ) . 
  it 's understandable the view is not reverse though , although i really dislike how polish people define us and have a word for us that is indistinguishable from the one used for one of our infamous minority . 
  except everything related to immigration in western countries has been national policy ( much alike how it works in other federal states - us ) and very unlikely to change . 
  unless we start to vote in crazy far-leftists , which is very unlikely . 
  that 's probably because anti-eurofed people are blinded by hyper-nationalism and completely unable to understand the sacrifices necessary for progress , unity and peace . 
  regionally , poland is a ** power ** capable of power projection . 
  with the recent significant bumping up of romanian defense spending , aquisition of a new air capabilities , only two eastern european countries truly have the potential to be less than useless . 
   hungarian military kek . 
  as if we need more romanian + allied troops rolling through budapest again . 
  maybe the third time 's the charm . 
  yes , absolutely , especially under french and german leadership . 
   western values are not superior to whatever shitty culture sprung in your shithole russian logic . 
  a leftist loon ideologue who will bring about the failing of the country who voted him in you mean . 
  you should maybe stop buying russian/leftist propaganda and start reading some documents ? 
  start with unsc resoultion 1386 ( afghanistan ) , 1441 , 1483 ( iraq ) . 
  do n't even get me started on libyia . 
  when benghazi was surrounded in the same day of the institution of the no fly zone , the whole of reddit was circlejerking on streams about how evil the unsc would be if they let them get basically clutser bombed to death ( which is what would have happened judging by intel ) . 
  if you are nato , you 're damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  it 's very easy to see the world through your simplistic lenses , but you 'll find your opinions might change if you put a little time in real documented research instead of spending it on media and opinions . 
  why would you be paranoid about a country who only engages in warfare after un security council resolutions , against genocidal dictators ? 
  say what you will about the gigantic blunders of the us military intervention in the middle east , the us has not been in any shape or form an aggressive actor for nigh a decade now - moving more and more towards a worrying isolationist stance . 
  barring gigantic geopolitical prefigurations that happen only by century , the us is the closest and most natural european ally . 
  good . 
  european defense spending is a joke . 
  we ca n't and should n't count on the american taxpayer and the american government for our security . 
  we are allies , of course , but the current state of affairs is a very unilateral relationship and both parties know it does n't benefit either . 
  except when they bring about technological progress beyond the pace of moore 's law ? 
  better than european taxpayers . 
  they voted in power a government whom massively borrowed , they need to face the consequences . 
  now imagine all your allies using that argument . 
  it 's actually incredible how few people suspect that , including people involved in intelligence ( which i am acquainted with ) although it seems obvious to me . 
  there has been nothing in any media , conservative or liberal , suggesting that with the exception of some academics . 
  including those . 
  i 've said some super harsh shit lately , yes . 
  i do n't think anyone should be shot by any law . 
  it is very much likely that snowden has ties to fsb though . 
  his lawyer is , really , fsb supplied . 
  you do n't fight a war with gloves . 
  fight fire with fire . 
  the recent 25 years which have been the least violent in terms of human conflict ? 
  yes , that 's what he 's talking about . 
  what 's wrong about shelling the rebel stronghold of terrorists that desire to break up your country ? 
  well fucking done to ukrainians . 
  he 's blabbing reality . 
  that is so fucking old . 
  i live in piata unirii and drink in the old town daily . 
  things have changed a lot in the past 5 years . 
  unrelated , but hello fellow psychonaut : ), 
  flemish history is badass .
