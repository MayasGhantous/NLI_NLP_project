  i played as it during a ck2 campaign but to my shame , i know very little history of pre-belgium flanders . 
  why is this guy being so eagerly downvoted for saying he wants nato hq in france ? 
  ( where it had been , until the 70s ) . 
  how is he `` not adding anything to the discussion '' ? 
  what the fucking fuck people . 
  also , people saying irrational stuff likd `` france being the most anti-nato member '' probably one of the reasons it is n't located in france is because of france 's pivotal role and importance within the alliance ( no offense to belgium , but it does n't project the kind of power france does ) . 
  it would simply be easy for france to exert its influence towards national goals rather than the alliance 's . 
  but it 's not because `` france is anti-nato '' have you forgot they will be paying billions in reparations for their refussal to deliver the mistrals ? 
  france is very committed ally . 
  i honestly believe that it 's so even in their public opinion , even if people are a bit more nationalistic in what they express .

  which employs , you know ... ** a hundred thousand fucking people ? 
  and these are n't walmart jobs . 
  weather . 
  football . 
  politics . 
  literally every taxi cab ride . 
  western people are reluctant to discuss politics with strangers , because it 's impolite . 
  same goes with most belief-related things in romania too . 
  except fucking politics . 
  you 'd think everyone graduated law school and is mastering in constitutional legislation . 
  probably because you have shit taste in urbanism and architecture . 
  it looks glorious and inspires force and swiftness . 
  architecturally it looks almost ** too ** well designed . 
  you think you 're being snarky ? 
  it actually was . 
  as much as i despise the soviets , even if they stole some of it and kept it in communist underdeveloped slavery for half a century , they ** did ** liberate our country . 
  the crimes of the two romanian fascist regimes were atrocious , even though they did not have much popular support and they were n't really perpetrated on romanian soil , but on annexed territories . 
  soviet occupation in romania has been free of violence and they treated the population well unlike in most of eastern europe . 
  and after we turned arms , we fought as allies for close to a year , in hungary , austria and czechoslovakia . 
  for a while , until 1948 it kind of looked we might actually get free elections , but they realized no communist political force ever had more than 1-2 % electorate here so they overthrew all democratic institutions . 
  and the rest is history . 
  my point is : the liberation of romania from romanian fascists really was so . 
  we are taught of it as such and many , perhaps most romanians would agree . 
  yes . 
  not literally obviously . 
  i just have very little sympathy for the historical `` wrongdoings '' of those who fought such regimes , and especially nazism . 
  but are they really , in terms of relative numbers to their population ? 
  anything to annihilate communism and nazism . 
  is that so morally wrong ? 
  downvoted because of / r/europe 's blatant anti-american bias . 
  how unsurprising . 
  the soviets won the war , and eastern europe lost it under the communist boot more than germany . 
  that 's the justice of history ... 
  say what you will about call of duty , but its storylines ( which , imo , have better quality than given credit for by the gaming community ) are not particularly pro-american in the sense that you might think . 
  many of the villains are americans or subversive american entities . 
  a lot of the cod series portrays russians positively and in a more nuanced manner than most hollywood movies pertaining to the cold war . 
  there 's no bad brits tho . 
  advanced warfare is very pro-military and martial values , but decidedly anti-corporate and corporate involvement in military matters . 
  try to look deeper into call of duty . 
  you wo n't find remarque or konrad wisdom , but you might be surprised at the depth of the storylines - contrary to popular belief . 
  the fact it 's mostly enjoyed by 16-year olds surely does not aid that kind of discourse though . 
  you souund so innocent and completely unaware of history . 
  in comparison to whom . 
  when ? 
  the european economy ( and especially industray ) was a joke compared to america , even before the 50s . 
  what international obligations ? 
  why are n't they going to china or russia ? 
  the west , as usual , takes all the blame , but also has to support all consequences . 
  what the fuck ? 
  basically all our candles are from north korea ? 
  absolutely nothing in the law forbids the mention of the holocaust . 
  '' * ** there has been a recent law expressly forbidding the support of nazism and communism in order to curtail such extremist voices ** ; yet the russian and anti-eu media still spun it as ukrainie = nazism , and this community bought it . 
  it 's really like ( even less like ) saying greece was nazi when golden dawn got in parliament or something absurd like that . 
  also , they are under a war of aggression , and if anything i respect the ukrainian government 's restraint . 
  everything this guy posts is solely blogspam anti-ua/us/eu and pro-russia .

  no western country has even comparable inequality to russia . 
  even the us is orders of magnitude more of an economically equal society . 
  people should learn to adapt to changing economic circumstances , instead of begging the government to fix their problems . 
  well , maybe your friends should work hard to get rich , and then be able to afford housing in london instead of feeling entitled to housing ? 
  i 'm not some libertarian extremist . 
  i do agree there should be a certain amount of regulation on rent and lease , but ultimately the price reflects the demand and that 's how it should be . 
  i do n't think you understand what a tax is if you asked such an inane question , with numbers pulled out of your ass . 
  you really proved his point though , however you try to weasel out of it . 
  literally the only political entity that has vague anti-hungarian tendencies is being made illegal . 
  udmr has been part of ** governance ** not just parliament for the better part of 25 years , whilst prm has never been part of governance . 
  autonomy is just unconstitutional and hungarians need to learn it 's not the lack of autonomy that covasna and harghita are not prospering . 
  i just wish we 'd stop identifying ourselves based on ethnicity or religion . 
  all romanian citizens are equal , be them muslims in dobruja , lipovan russians or my hungarian dad . 
  personally ? 
  i would n't care much - more sensationalist stuff . 
  i think ponta ( just like basescu used to ) is getting a large amount of unjustified hate . 
  problem is , ponta was born in bucharest not moldavia . 
  and merkel did not grow up in berlin . 
  i hope you understand what i 'm trying to say . 
  conditions were rather different . 
  i do n't think it 's a very relevant question . 
  of course . 
  a large portion of ethnic romanians would agree with them . 
  it 's just slimy to justify their opinion with `` i 'm hungarian , therefore i should have more of a say because i 'm a minority !, 
  '' ... otherwise i see no reason why he would mention his ethnicity as a justification .
