  it 's just irrational to call merkel communist . 
  she 's looking after her own countries ' interests ( less and less though , as russian aggression is more brazen ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure her and the governing christian dems do not enjoy being blackmailed by gazprom constantly . 
  it 's especially far fetched to say she 's a commie when germany actually has communist relics like die linke , and other extreme-leftists and/or russian appeasers ; sometimes literally on gazprom 's payroll ... like gerhard schr\u00f6der . 
  there is nothing about her policy , internal or foreign , that has any of the characteristics of communism ; and making that judgement based on decades-old pictures of a young girl in a totalitarian environment is very exaggerated . 
  would you honestly say mihai razvan ungureanu is a communist just because he was part of utc ? 
  transnistria should be a fucking crater and it certainly would be if we had our way . 
  someday , all artificial ussr relics must end . 
  can people like you , for one second , have one inch of empathy instead of spewing their self-serving , wannabe - `` rational '' rhetoric ? 
  i 'm not very nationalist and i believe in european federalization . 
  most of the people i know involved in pro-unification movements ** are not prm/noua dreapta drones ** . 
  the racism against moldavians within romania ( and beyond the prute ) is getting pretty ridiculous , especially considering it 's mostly spat out by comfortable , privileged hipsters from bucharest/transylvania who just had the luck to be born somewhere with more infrastructure . 
  moldavians are , by all ethno-cultural and even judicial norms , ** ethnic romanians ** , and the fact they are not romanian citizens is a soviet anomaly that has to , and will be corrected sooner or later . 
  why do you have to think in solely selfish materialistic terms when you see so much will for unification ? 
  it 's easy to get jaded when you see super-religious , regressive hyper nationalists touting about unification . 
  but just because they 're wrong on many issues , does n't automatically mean they 're wrong on this one . 
  think of how much progress ** millions of romanians ** would undergo by being part of the eu and nato . 
  and maybe , heck , even have a tiny bit of peaceful national pride . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that despite what a postmodern circlejerk like reddit would have you believe . 
  wow , such thesaurus . 
  can you stop with the fucking cliches ? 
  in which dimension is angela merkel a communist ? 
  this is minimizing the impact of communism and the sacrifice of its victims . 
  it 's like throwing the word `` nazi '' around for any mild right-winger . 
  ( and , btw , i 'm pro-unification ), 
  [ very gameofthronesy indeed . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kmrti79d2js ), 
  trusting anything the guardian has to say about uk conservatives is akin to believing fox news ' take on obama or rt about ukraine . 
  what is this racist fucking bullshit ? 
  ** op is a regular racist poster in r/conspiracy . 
  ** no exaggeration or throwing the word around ; he 's just a racist . 
  also , about nigel farange in the video ( i 'm kind of sure it 's him , but i might be wrong ) , i bet he would n't think of me as a good brit immigrant - if i were - , even though i 'm white ( saying this makes me feel slimy ) and would respect the laws . 
  i 'm a conservative and i have a question . 
  what in god 's name happened to young people on the right ? 
  it feels everyone identifying as such nowadays is a stormfronter or an insane libertarian . 
  what happened to defending western values , of which one is equality ? 
  rather than secessionist political agendas pursued by snp and salmond which divide the world *, 
  how about you stay out , you fucking hippie ? 
  i welcome as many of our allies on our territory as manageable , be them americans , french or turks . 
  also , you play lol . 
  that makes me lol . 
  also , you are a conspiratard that takes the zeitgeist movement seriously . 
  you should have your head examined . 
  like ? 
  who ? 
  who the fuck would come to our aid if we were invaded ? 
  broomstick germans ? 
  maybe the russians would use mistral ships for an amphibious landing in romania . 
  i 'm glad they did . 
  what americans did n't do though , is machinate to install a fascist regime in romania , and then dictate to us to give away half of transylvania . 
  anything to fight fascism . 
  `` eu troops '' . 
  lol . 
  the only entity that would ever defend this continent is america . 
  i 'd rather live among americans than italians , thank you . 
  russia in general means only death and destruction . 
  no thanks, 
  taking part in a joint nato exercise . 
  because the world is not your privileged scandinavian bubble . 
  you are oblivious to the issue facing real people . . which are n't scandinavians , whose countries cumulative populations do n't equal london . 
  i 'm tired of hearing of your animal welfare and your feminism and how many offensive words are made illegal every week . 
  i do n't give a fuck . 
  your countries should n't be used as examples in contrast to anything , at least not more than san marino . 
  and why would you begin your statement with `` because '' ? 
  uk people voting conservative , primarily owed to the economy , is just proving my point . 
  more cameron smearing ( despite the title , that is the real gist of the article ) . 
  seemingly no uk socialists anywhere can get it in their heads the british people will keep voting conservative . 
  and why would n't they if the economy is improving ? 
  there are a lot of hypotheses about the origins of romanians , still it is very historiographically likely the romanian ethnicity has a large roman component . 
  the settling of dacia and its administrative integration before the aurelian retreat was carried out with much verve than with other acquired provinces . 
  as for the romanian mentality , it 's mostly owed to [ these people ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_school ), 
  both countries classified as `` high human development '' ( romania one-two years away from `` very high '' ) . 
  yeah , why would they want to come here from namibia ? 
  always nice to see our allies . 
  well , i 'm hoping there are a lot of people that would react like me , but it 's still extremely anti-social to promote that . 
  i 'm saying that providing a populace with a stable , economically free and democratically representative political system corresponds with prosperity and progress . 
  that makes `` right '' . 
  the eternal stabbed-in-the-back myth . 
  every single ideology or political project that fails , does n't because of its inherent flaws ( german expansionism and lebensraum , communism , libertarianism , anarchy , etc ) ... it 's always the jews , the russians , the us ; anyone but its supporters . 
  it is the underlying logical fallacy that binds all revolutionary mentalities together . 
  and what happens to the socio-economic interests of europeans ? 
  i think those should come first . 
  i was addressing the fact it seemed like you said a parliament ca n't be wrong on an issue because it 's the will of the people . 
  democracy means more than representation and decision making . 
  it also involves the protection of basic human rights , which are non negotiable , no matter how large the mob . 
  i love that comic so much . 
  it 's very well drawn , emotional and mature ( without being overtly violent ) . 
  it 's kind of a pity they resort to this just because it has a swastika in print ( not even on all editions ' covers ! ), 
  russians are only interested in the horrors of ww2 inasmuch as it glorifies their conquering of half a continent and calling it liberation - just because it 's the lesser of two great evils . 
  there simply is n't as much focus on the humanitarian issues of ww2 in russian education and culture , where massively more civillians died than military personnel ... that would probably have to involve them coming to terms with their own crimes before , during , and after the war . 
  whatever false equivalencies and examples people might give , western allies ' war crimes are breadcrumbs compared to the soviet 's conduct in ww2 . 
  i feel a bit uncomfortable talking about this , considering my romanian ancestors committed great atrocities in ukraine during the war ( and i am really grateful they were defeated ) still i feel it should n't be overlooked . 
  how about if the parliament favors the death penalty ? 
  or is populism only correct when morally defensible ? 
  what a bunch of grown men with the mentality of attention seeking teenagers . 
  they 're also in cahoots with the russian administration . 
  great rebellious counter-culture there ... you fucking pussies on wheels . 
  also , the study from the stockholm institute was done in very different times in terms of euro-dollar parity . 
  i am as pro-nato as any good romanian and if red tanks cross the dneister , i will enlist . 
  but boycotting private entities based on that criteria is bad and not really morally required .
