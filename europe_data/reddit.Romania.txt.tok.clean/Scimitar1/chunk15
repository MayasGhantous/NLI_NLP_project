  it 's not indecent to buy russian products just because their government is becoming hostile ( unless in the case of actual military conflict ), 
  and ? 
  what 's the problem ? 
  do you mind an economy that is working ? 
  all those fucking hipsters whining about malls and consumerism in romania ( from their probably really privileged households in bucharest or cluj ) have no real arguments , just a pressing need to tell private entities how to spend their money . 
  oh no , the eu is dying again . 
  this has happened more often than i have quit cigarettes for ever . 
  how did russia `` go to shit lately '' ? 
  after a decade of constant economic growth and collaboration with the west , there simply is n't an excuse for this kind of behavior on the international scene . 
  well , i was n't trolling , that 's how i genuinely feel about russia : d and i 'm pretty sure you were n't either . 
  the appeal of historical triumphalism is generally too strong with you people . 
  with statements like `` americans really wanted to destroy iraq '' you come off as incredibly ignorant and just ... plain anti-american ( like most clueless europeans ) it was a misjudged and mismanaged intervention , but they spent a lot of money rebuilding , they made a point of iraqi freedom and minimizing civillian casualties . 
  they expected another south korea or japan situation , where you can change a regime and then rebuild it in prosperity to the interest of both parties . 
  and it might have worked had it not been for insurgents supported by neighbors that did n't want a strong iraq ( one of which , paradoxically , an american ally ) . 
  it really started working in the past few years had it not been for isis . 
  people really have no idea about the war in iraq , and that 's a solid victory for kremlin 's propaganda machine . 
  do n't support invasive dictators , do n't try to subvert our media with kremlin-funded propaganda and bam , just like that , russophobia gone . 
  and yet , in 2015 , romania has a higher development index than russia and higher inequality adjusted gdp-per-capita ( and much better perspectives ) and it would be much higher if it were n't for half a century of communist slavery . 
  the persian empire did great things too , yet i 'd rather live in lichtenstein than iran . 
  you 're so fucking bitter lol , it 's amazing . 
  it 's this kind of attitude that has me convined russians will always be a threat to the world , and need to be contained . 
  even in your imperialistic logic , russia is but a blip in comparison to the true great nations of history ( france , britain , us , germany ) . 
  that was a huge oversight on my part and my opinion on this comparison has kind of changed . 
  most of that is not charity , simply development funds ** for eu countries ** . 
  in absolute and relative terms , the us gives more to charity and ** external ** foreign aid than anyone else . 
  [ hungary 's gdp every year . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_foreign_aid ) edit : nope . 
  that figure does not include development funds for eu countries . 
  i stand corrected ( and surprised at the actual magnitude of eu development aid ), 
  all european young people do that . 
  that 's pretty stereotypical, 
  what 's factually untrue about it ? 
  or it 's just the fact it portrays a slightly negative future for your daddy putin ? 
  like destruction and bolshevik slavery over half of europe . 
  and gulags . 
  better than israel ? 
  by what metric ? 
  jordan ? 
  the emirates ? 
  you have a very simple view of the middle east . 
  u wot ? 
  why is this your only post ? 
  why ... is this ? 
   wonderful romania legit source . 
  [ citation needed ] are you fucking insane ? 
  run them over with humvees ? 
  except for abu ghraib ( which was horrible , but a very isolated incident ) you will not be able to come up with such examples . 
  the psychopaths that caused abu ghraib got punished swiftly . 
  minimizing civillian casualties constitute a priority above operational objectives in the coalition doctrine . 
  there 's many examples of operational failure because us marines refused to engage in populated areas . 
  most civillian casualities in the iraq and afghan wars are the direct doing of terrorists or insurgents killing their conationals . 
  [ the russians mow through civillians as much as terrorists , and it seems to be a part of their primitive doctrine . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beslan_school_hostage_crisis ), 
  military contractors employed in combat scenarios are bound by the same rules and regulations of other nato military personnel . 
  they do n't kill pows . 
  this is something that the west simply does n't do . 
  more false equivalencies from putinbots . 
  sweet . 
  that means we 're doing something right . 
  go back to commiefornia or vote bernie sanders ; the adults are talking . 
  good . 
  i would react the same if i were in the crowd . 
  there 's no room for subversion in an already such fragile west . 
  spot on . 
  yeah , the horseshoe theory . 
  still , as a conservative , i 've always been more scared of the far right . 
  racism must not be allowed to exist . 
  never forget the red scourge . 
  just like germany was the first victim of nazism , russia was the first one of communism , and the first of many . 
  it 's a really abstract feeling , but with the rise of the far-right and far-left in europe , it makes me wonder if this peace we 've grown so accustomed and ** complacent ** to is truly here to last . 
  no , just clueless in terms of foreign policy . 
  never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  all of these countries are either very high human development by the hdi index , or will be in one-two years . 
  though still , i have my reserves on calling myself `` western '' . 
  there 's a lot of work to be done here yet . 
  but-but everyone keeps telling me ukraine is banning russian propaganda , and that 's bad . 
  they told me ukraine should just remain vulnerable to the media war of their aggressor . 
  i guess some f-22s at kogalniceanu would do much more to deter russian aggression , given that you need total air superiority to employ a-10s effectively . 
  either way , i love that plane so much . 
  it 's an ugly , cheap , mean fucking air fortress that has unmatched durability and usefuleness . 
  i hope they 'll train with it and i can get my hands on schedules cause i always wanted to see the hog fly . 
  when you gained independence . 
  furthermore , in many times of strife throughout all the modern period , many factions in ireland committed atrocities on protestants ( and viceversa ) . 
  but the comparison is beyond moot as we 're talking about the 21st century , a hybrid war , with no religious implications , that involves both new and old media to an extreme extent as a weapon to further russian interests . 
  the kremlin values its national security and projection of interests , and they already have such laws against western interests . 
  what you 're advocating is that ukraine should simply keep remaining vulnerable , in times of ** war ** which is just insane . 
  * if the ukrainian population genuinely and fully supports the idea of ukrainian independence * if ? 
  all polls show that it does , including in eastern ukraine ( excepting crimea ) . 
  you do n't quite understand how powerful of a weapon media can be and how malleable the masses are . 
  remember that in 2009 , 70 % of russians had a favorable view of america before kremlin decided to start its offensive master plan . 
  also , have you ever read dickens ? 
  i would n't say he 's the advocate for british imperialism , and definitely an extremely critical voice towards all the strata of english society . 
  nobody will ban reading dostoevsky and watching tarkovsky in ukraine ; hold your horses . 
  absolutely spot on , but everyone reasonable is still being downvoted by clueless hippies / kremlinbots . 
  ukraine is at war . 
  by all international laws and customs , limiting the ** invading enemies ** extraordinary subversive mediatic power is not just ethical and reasonable , but a requirement . 
  peacetime values do not apply when there is an existential threat to your country . 
  in their place , you would do the same . 
  do you realize what war is ? 
  i know it 's hard to empathize given your western affluent little lifestyle , but try to consider the consequences .
