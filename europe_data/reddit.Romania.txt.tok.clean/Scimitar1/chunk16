  russia is waging a subversive media war grander than any on the whole west , not just ukraine . 
  the difference is in ukraine there are also tanks and buks . 
  anything goes when fighting the red scourge . 
  well , not anything . 
  not breaching the geneva convention and not cluster bombs . 
  given how ansolutely useless and corrupt ukraine 's counter intelligence is , they can at least , reasonably , ban the overt media propaganda of their ** aggressive invading enemy ** . 
  good . 
  60 % would vote to stay in the eu according to yougov . 
  what do you mean by `` britain next '' ? 
  it 's extraordinarily unlikely either of these nations will leave the eu, 
  i 'm a conservative . 
  i want a strong state ( or states ) , with strong institutions based on western values , with no tolerance to cultural relativity when it comes to laws and regulations ... and regarding the article 's title : ** what exactly is the problem with this ? 
  ** sure , there 's fringe elements that refuse to integrate but by and large most muslims that settle here are european citizens , not only by name , but also in practice . 
  we 're dealing with a heavy demographic crisis . 
  instead of asking ourselves how to keep those people out , why not attempt to integrate them better and tackle the causes that determine extremists acts ? 
  ( disenfranchisement , inequality ) also , 10 % is not that significant for such a large timespan . 
  do you even fucking remember the separatists state one year ago ? 
  before kremlin 's heavy involvement ? 
  they were pushed to the damned border , with some pockets of resistance in the cities . 
  if russia wants to cut its losses , the terrorists will be annihilated in no time . 
  you 're too small to matter . 
  if you fight against progress , human rights and development , progress will fight back . 
  why should that happen though ? 
  why should people flee or die when you serbs can just continue on the path of euroatlantic integration ? 
  are you not getting tired of your neighbours overtaking you economically , in terms of security , and in terms of international reputation ? 
  as a disclaimer , i love serbian history and our countries have traditionally been close together ( romania is a nato country that does n't recognize kosovo ) . 
  i also believe kosovo should n't have been idependent but autonomous . 
  but now its 2015 and it 's time to think and move forward , and the way forward is not east . 
  except those massacred by serbs kek . 
  it 's not `` basically a military occupation '' , it is a military occupation . 
  and a just one . 
  and then belgrade will be in flames again . 
  you 're not helping the stereotype that you all have genocidal tendencies , you know that . 
  source ? 
  yougov pegs the percentage of those who 'd vote for brexit at 40 % and continuously dwindling . 
  the myth that the british people are isolationist ukip drones simply does n't represent reality , as much as misguided anti-europeans would have you believe . 
  that saturation though ... looks really unnatural . 
  no , it 's actually about the armaments . 
  serious military analysts are increasingly discounting the importance of avionics in an age where air capability is mostly reduced to the quality of what the platform is armed with . 
  whenever i read that endlessly reposted fucking article ( by hippies and putinbots ) about why the f-35 supposedly `` sucks '' i ca n't help but cringe . 
  it 's not about how they fly , it 's about the armaments . 
  i do n't genuinely believe you are paid by any kremlin-funded institution . 
  putinbot is just a general term for actual russian trolls and useful idiots alike - both serving the same subversive purposes , wittingly or not . 
  i am studying international law and policy with our actual foreign minister , so no , just because i have morals does n't make me `` oblivious to geopolitics '' . 
  there are other schools of thought besides sociopathic realists that see the world in spheres of influence , like kissinger , mearsheimer . 
  or redditors that think arguing for appeasement in a realpolitik context makes them seem smart . 
  we are in a `` us vs them '' situation , and not by our doing . 
  the problem is a lot of misguided people like you resort to false equivalencies and a supposed neutrality ( which is just disguised anti-americanism , that 's what 's all about for people like you ) . 
  that is also why you are them , and you are the enemy of the free world . 
  no quarter to aggressive expansionist fascists ; no sympathy to those who support them . 
  that is the way it should be . 
  putinbots like you are just surprised the western public is n't as spineless as you thought or as comfortable as our leaders . 
  even so , that was in the aftermath of the most destructive and shocking terrorist attack in history . 
  americans had all the reason to feel scared , attacked and desire a strong leader . 
  the whole ukrainian debacle is on the backdrop of a decade of fruitful , peaceful and even friendly cooperation between russia and the west - the same decade providing huge economic growth in russia . 
  the russian people have no excuse for being so brainwashed , and i have no sympathy for their current economic hardships . 
  that 's quite informative and puts things in perspective . 
  all the polls i 'm reading show very favorable numbers for the tories . 
  it 's not surprising , as the uk has been one of the fastest growing economies in europe the past two years , on most metrics . 
  yougov shows preference for brexit at about 40 % , so it 's very likely people would also vote to remain in the eu next year . 
  yes , i do support russia 's claim to chechenya . 
  what is the problem with bombing armed , rebellious , violent , externally supported separatists ? 
  maybe if ukraine was armed with precise artillery they would n't have to resort to cluster bombs to fight off an invasion . 
  english is the international language because no other linguistic group is tied to the international power and influence of the anglosphere . 
  there really is n't any other reason . 
  languages do n't come about , gain influence and fade due to practicality , or hungarian and romanian should never have existed and we 'd all be speaking esperanto . 
  i , for one , have been forced to study french 4 years in high school and i can barely form a few phrases . 
  i love french culture and history - more than british - but for the love of god , this language is so atrocious and phonetically disgusting that ... it just makes me feel queasy to hear french spoken . 
  and it was easy to study for a romanian because the grammar is extremely similar . 
  with english , even though i 've never lived in an english speaking country , it 's the language i think in 50 % of the time . 
  the author of the article really is the stereotypical pre-entente french anglophobe , with fewer robust arguments than thesaurus tabs open . 
  this is way strange . 
  there 's no great differences in economic growth , public debt , human development index or in other socio-economic markers - romania and bulgaria will probably be classified as `` very high hd '' next year or in 2017 . 
  i never figured bulgarians would be so pessimistic as the media here in romania loves to complain a lot and they 're showing bulgaria as a model in many ways ( eg : tourism industry ), 
  why do you have to be a cunt about it though ? 
  most british people are not ukip drones . 
  i find it very hard to believe you have n't met good looking women , but maybe you just exchanged your native basement with another . 
  all hail glorious erd\u00e8lyan master race . 
  all slaves were freed from wallachia in 1843 before its abolition in both principalities by 1856 ( djuvara , `` intre orient \u015fi occident . 
  in contrast , serfdom was abolished in the empire in 1848 , which , of course , is not the same thing , but it speaks about the presumed differences in progress between transylvania and the rest . 
  he 's downvoted for being a complete shitbag and wrong about everything else except for knowing wallachia is muntenia . 
  he literally used the word `` mitic '' . 
  that article on `` weirds '' is the best summarization of the flaws in post-modern thinking , and it also explains convincingly the social dangers of this change of paradigm . 
  it 's what hooked me to the blog . 
  it absolutely true the weirds are so devoted to advocating for a culture that would take all their most valued rights away , whilst criticizing the western culture that guarantees them ... just because it 's dominant . 
  he 's not saying all these entities are connected , just that they are organically and unfortunately growing to antisocial extremes . 
  but i still mostly disagree on his assessment of obama because it just feels like american right wing pundit speak . 
  on islam , he basically postulates no change in policy and is ** explicitly against immigration control for muslims ** ( of course , that would be insane ) , promoting just a change in attitude . 
  wall street journal and the economist , like others have said . 
  the level of content on [foreignpolicy.com ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/ ) is likewise very insightful and worth the paywall . 
  for military , intelligence and security matters , [ this guy 's musings are absolutely great ] ( http://20committee.com/ ) . 
  it 's administered by an ex-sigint operator . 
  though he has his own biases towards the conservative side of america , he is very vocally against the melding of corporate interests with military matters and how it 's rightfully ruining the trust in america 's military . 
  also , against the middle eastern wars . 
  if you want to read a rational mildly conservative viewpoint , this would be it . 
  it 's unlikely someone with actual technical knowledge of such operations would write for the guardian or msnbc . 
  romania lost moldavia and larger population than all the ethnic hungarians lost in trianon in all countries their empire was overlord over , and there is no such thing . 
  there was one rather influential party in the 90s but now it 's a running joke . 
  there 's also the fact in every census since the early modern era , romanians have been the majority in transylvania , and for a large portion of that history , they were second class citizens . 
  hungarian claims are not justified by anything except literal imperialism , nostalgia for domination and their regressive stance is unreasonable to empathize with in a modern world .
