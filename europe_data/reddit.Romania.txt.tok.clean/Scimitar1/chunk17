  again with the logically inconsistent equivalence . 
  where steppe people can feel at home : d !, 
  im ^ really ^ sorry ^ sajn\u00e1lom ^ jk, 
  there is no such thing as `` different people '' . 
  all gaps can be fixed by policies of assimilation , education , being part of the workforce and decreasing the causes of social exclusion . 
  furthermore , romani people are not religious zealots or extremists of any kind . 
  that is not a characteristic of their culture . 
  there is nothing keeping them from integration if we implemented strong policies encouraging such , apart from just sending them to emmigrate to europe by the millions and fuelling more racism there too . 
  i have conservative values in general , but the level of racism towards the roma community , and how acceptable it is basically in the whole world ( ** but especially romania ** ) , to me is outrageous . 
  and probably the reason they are so lagging behind in cultural progress , why they are so insular . 
  i am not the kind of person to scream `` oppresshuun '' on tumblr , but a large part of the blame is on the authorities and the majority populations . 
  the greatest blame for the conduct of gypsies and their resistance to integration are romanian policies , from slavery ( times immemorial - 1868 ) to communist ethnic dynamics which were indistinguishable from segregation . 
  you are only fuelling this mentality , and isolating them more wo n't determine progress in their already very insular culture . 
  they are romanians as much as you and me . 
  we need to move on from the idea nationality is determined by ethnicity . 
  this topic does n't have to move forward in any way and there no serious discussions in any european political forum about this so called * issue * , because it is n't - except to the resurgent hungarian ultra-nationalists . 
  beyond the fact they lost the war , romanians have always been a mistreated majority in transylvania which opted out through ** referendum ** for unification . 
  we could get into genocide olympics and hungary 's conduct in the 40s , but you would n't find many romanian counter-examples . 
  absolutely not . 
  this false equivalency is beyond misleading . 
  we do n't have one single political entity in parliament that is even close to the level of nationalism and fascist accents that is the hungarian mainstream . 
  the closest thing would be the new right clowns - whom , for comparison sake , is more similar to fidesz than jobbik ... but they ca n't even form a party . 
  you absolutely ca n't claim romanians and hungarians are `` just as progressive ... not so much '' on these issues . 
  ** and no , you wo n't find that attitude on both sides of the border , and i 'm proud romanians uphold progressive and european values on this issue ** do you honestly believe romanians have the same borderline expansionistic feelings towards moldova as hungarians do about covasna and harghita ? 
  a party representing hungarian interests has been part of * governance * ( not just parliament ) in most coalitions in the past 25 years , with even some support from romanian voters ( i voted for udmr once ) . 
  the 2 minoritarily hungarian counties enjoy a large degree of autonomy , state financed cultural projects , legal documents in their language and a gigantic degree of political influence . 
  our ethnic policy , if you read the constitution and laws pertaining to it , is indistinguishable from scandinavian countries . 
  ethnic hungarians are romanian citizens as much as you and me , and that 's how it should be . 
  there is hardly any tension and you 'd be hard pressed to come up with examples . 
  furthermore , [ general romanian attitudes towards minorities are significantly more progressive and above the eu average ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tc6zare.png ) , if you were to quantify it . 
  we voted for johannis and tens of thousands of people protested when our previous president belittled a palestinian official . 
  hungary is at the other end of the spectrum . 
  hungarian strategic interests and political attitudes diverge more and more from european/nato interests and ** values ** towards being part of an eurasian block of authoritarianism and that can hardly be denied . 
  likewise there are plenty of israeli arabs who support parties that go against the national interests of israel , and they are allowed complete political agency . 
  israel is the only democracy in the middle east , and if you were israeli , you would not sacrifice your existential security for the welfare of those who vote hamas in power . 
  hamas ' charter literally calls for the destruction of israel . 
  that is the end goal , and it has political support . 
  israel won 4 defensive wars against their neighbors ' aggression . 
  how many more until these people learn israelis have a right to exist ? 
  because you are . 
  and he 's lost the war , his country partitioned , further hostilities inevitable - all because of a weak west . 
  how exactly is being part of an alliance `` puppet '' ? 
  if anything , eastern eu is a burden on the us - a us with a foreign policy more and more isolationist . 
  there might be opportunities to sell lng or even frack , but when it comes down to it , this is about the interests of the west in general , not the us . 
  i was ambivalent about voting iohannis because i wanted a peaceful political climate in romania , but after 4 months , - in my case , he exceeded my expectations . 
  for starters , i was expecting a weak public presence from mr. iohannis , in order for him to diferentiate himself from his predecessor ( that 's why many people voted for him ) . 
  [ his public support and very stern stance on corruption is a big reason why even the socialist media has stopped criticizing the dna and also why many parliamentaries lifted immunity for their culprit colleagues . 
  ] ( http://actmedia.eu/daily/president-iohannis-a-parliament-that-goes-soft-on-corruption-and-the-corrupt-will-never-enjoy-the-respect-and-trust/56482 ) another issue that iohannis ' campaign ignored is foreign policy . 
  basescu 's ( ex-president ) committed support of nato and western integration not just economically , but in foreign policy was beyond that of european leaders and something that he was exceptionally good at . 
  i thought iohannis might take germany 's stance ( or at least how it was a few months ago ) of pseudo-neutrality . 
  [ instead , he 's pushing for a bipartisan pact of massively improving defense . 
  ] ( http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2015/01/12/iohannis-i-have-obtained-necessary-consensus-so-that-defense-budgeting-reaches-2-pct-of-gdp-in-2017-17-41-50 ) there is a sense of normalcy and ... more inclusiveness along political lines in romania since he was elected . 
  basescu was probably the most divisive figure ever in our recent history , and this is a welcome change . 
  i like his public image a lot , his involvement in cultural events , his online presence and just the whole effect he had on the political class and media . 
  there is a slight general feeling that things are going `` ok '', 
  in class , many times he discussed the merits of appeasement and does n't seem such a strong proponent of strong millitaties . 
  he 's s smart guy with a lot of nitty-gritty , technical knowledge of such instruments ( not only diplomatic , but military too ) . 
  [ but looking through his recent public appearances since he took office , he seems thoroughly committed to nato which makes me happy .

  this guy was my professor ( university of bucharest law ) . 
  such a thoroughly cool guy , though i disagree with his foreign policy . 
  saving private ryan is very sweeping , realistic and kind of awe inspiring - especially in its depiction of combat . 
  it 's not an arthouse movie of the likes of the thin red line ( on the same subject ) , but it 's a very good piece of cinematic work regardless . 
  why should it not be taken as a model ? 
  that looks super bad ass . 
  downloading . 
  ladies and gentleman , here we have it . 
  postmodern thinking in a nutshell - disregarding even the very idea that art can be patriotic . 
  what 's wrong about patriotism in art ? 
  does every single piece of cinematic artwork have to be subersive , anti-system , or cynical ? 
  what 's happened to being proud of your nation ? 
  in civility and peace , of course . 
  what if it 's completely and utterly removed from current issues , such as the battle of grunwald ? 
   how many of the patriotic and history glorifying mastodont movies are actually good ? 
  a large number , really . 
  a more recent movie with very patriotic undertones that is n't historical was `` gravity '' - about america 's potential for continued exploration and discovery in space , an the necessity of cooperation with other space programs . 
  ( cuaron even said as much ) . 
  [ i thought this romanian movie was pretty good , and most critics think the same . 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066078/ ) it is the definition of a historical mastodont , filmed from the budget of the state ( on the backdrop of resurgent nationalism in the romanian communist party ) , with sweeping battle scenes and literally tens of thousands of extras unseen in hollywood till the 90s . 
  there is ** nothing ** wrong with being proud of your history , especially a history as proud as poland 's . 
  and the problem is ... ? 
  i for one would like to see it . 
  polish history is filled with courage against adversity . 
  everything that 's not socialism is cheating ? 
  i call it a pro-business environment , and it works for everyone . 
  thanks !, 
  how is nato expansion immoral , unethical or illegal ? 
  it 's been done with the full consent , support and democratic approval of new member states . 
  ** `` oops sorry no , you ca n't join nato , even though you meet all the criteria and it 's beneficial to both of us - we have to appease the kremlin who kept you in communist slavery for half a century '' **, 
  trump cares little about a strong foreign policy , and [ has repeatedly said he wants to work with putin and would maintain friendly relations . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/dec/09/who-wants-donald-trump-in-the-white-house-evidently-putin-does ) oligarchs of a feather flock together . 
  edit : you lived in cluj ? 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  have you been to enigma ? 
  ( steampunk bar ), 
  portugal , the arch-enemy of traditional french values . 
  the turks graded their test with `` f '' , as in f16 . 
  i did indeed . 
  for a while . 
  but nato is evolving its anti-ballistic capabilities faster than expected .
