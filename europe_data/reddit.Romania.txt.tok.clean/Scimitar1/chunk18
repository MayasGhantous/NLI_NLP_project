  who knows if that will be the case in 30 years . 
  it does n't really take more work besides sukhois not violating turkish airspace with transponders off after they 've been warned repeatedly not to . 
  it 's really rather simple . 
  that they are heavily misinformed and numbed after a century of strife . 
  you should read up on the minutiae of operation storm . 
  a big reason you have a country right now is nato support . 
  i 've known some croatians , and they would disagree with you . 
  i 'm very surprised you have this worldview . 
  very few of our current problems are because of russia . 
  our particularly awful brand of communism was completely nationalist and very anti-moscow . 
  we do n't want more though , and neither do you . 
  reality in this situation has an anti-russian bias , at least in regards to the interests of europe and western values . 
  there is absolutely no reason why eastern countries would not ally with nato . 
  zero . 
  it 's brought only benefits . 
  and croatia has reaped these benefits probably more than any other country . 
  you 're probably a butthurt serb though . 
  i feel ya . 
  he 's been a rather successful and effective president for the russian people before the whole ukraine debacle . 
  ( for his top 0.0001 % billionaires mostly , but it 's definitely trickled down ) . 
  he 's definitely a bully , not only on the world stage , but on an interpersonal level too . 
  but do n't make the mistake of thinking that 's not an effective strategy . 
  i think the west has a lot to learn from putin , not in managing internal affairs , but in foreign policy . 
  russian people do not want democracy . 
  they see it as weak . 
  check the polls . 
  russian people also do n't want peace , check the polls . 
  60 % believe the baltic countries should n't be independent . 
  public opinion in russia should be the least consideration in drafting defense strategies in europe . 
  instead , we should find a way to cooperate with the kremlin . 
  their leaders are definitely more sane than their constituents . 
  will russia declare war on a nato country is their plane is shot down ? 
  it 's already happened once . 
  why ca n't it keep happening , until they stop ? 
  i obviously do n't advocate that . 
  we should keep the russians caged and contained , peacefully . 
  you do n't cut the paw of a rabid animal if it pokes through the bars of its cage . 
  but if it comes to confrontation ... do n't think that the pentagon is as quick to appease aggression as those in brussels . 
  many countries made that mistake before . 
  upvoted . 
  gr8 b8 . 
  i 've seen you before , i know everything you write is anti-western/pro-russian , but i 'm just gon na address that as if you had no agenda . 
  ** what is anti-russian about wanting to maintain your sovereignity ? ** . 
  i love how you people manage to spin aggressive russian incursions into estonia as estonia being anti-russian . 
  it 's amazing . 
  sooner or later , you 'll have to get it through your head that the large majority of eastern europeans want / nothing / to do with russian influence , ever again . 
  there 's only so many times our countries will be resource-extraction sites for moscow . 
  and they 've also manifested the democratic desire to become integrated with nato and eu institutions ( how 'd neutrality work for poland , hmm ? ) . 
  and that has been very beneficial for everyone involved , economically , militarily , politically . 
  there is absolutely no rational reason why eastern european states should n't be part of nato . 
  for the past decades , nato has been shifting its focus towards anti-terrorism and middle eastern power projection , ( oftentimes in partnership with russia ) . 
  but the current ex-kbg led kremlin , through its aggression , has refreshed the nato statue back to its original purpose - the defense of democracy and sovereignity in europe . 
  the administrative situation in northern syria ( especially on the border with turkey ) is a bit fuzzy , similar to donbass . 
  the turkmens there are ( according to some reports ) significantly integrated in turkish command structures . 
  to everybody calling for hostile action , think about the weakness of a military-political complex that can only gain face on the world stage by provoking constantly . 
  we do n't need to fall to their level . 
  nato does n't need to act rash . 
  we have overwhelming superiority . 
  besides probing response times and maybe some intelligence gathering , these incursions are no threat . 
  or at least no threat that requires hostile action . 
  60 % of russians do n't believe the baltics should be independent nations . 
  how much longer will putin be in power , and what happens when some ultranationalist succeeds him ? 
  reminder that the sukhoi shot down over turkey likewise had transponders off , making it impossible to identify . 
  though it was n't technically required to keep it on , the ~ ~ turkmen ~ ~ turkish air force were likewise not technically required to not shoot it down . 
  also in a period when turkey repeatedly said it will not be lenient with absolutely no aeronautical incursion over their territory . 
  though i think they would have shot a russian plane if they knew the origin , they had all the reason to suspect it was syrian , and no reason to let it in the air in turkish airspace not even a second . 
  ** not [ after this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_turkish_f-4_phantom_shootdown ) ** . 
  it makes you wonder how accidental the all these russian incursions are, 
  this is absolutely true . 
  i love serbia and many people i know from here feel the same , but they need to get over the awful past and accept some degree of cooperation with the west . 
  [ they received billions since the conflict ended ] ( https://books.google.ro/books?id=rejraqaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa187&amp;lpg=pa187&amp;dq=american+aid+to+serbia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bunzg9cr5l&amp;sig=oa4mihqc2gem-iuzlor1hl5zi8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjop6fjkm_jahuhfg8khwlvdn84chdoaqg7mam#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20aid%20to%20serbia&amp;f=false ) and that 's ** only ** from the us . 
  russia gave / zero / in aid and they are the serbian 's gods , to the point they would n't cooperate with any international law while us is influent . 
  that 's a very unjust and dangerous view , considering they made a lot of mistakes and their neighbours will never allow their artificial state to exist again without a fight . 
  [ the comparison is eerily close to fascism . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hitler-and-the-socialist-dream-1186455.html . 
  ) i hope the refugee question is solved soon peacefully before these movements snowball and tensions rise . 
  you 're right , edited . 
  though i did n't say anything rude . 
  jesus christ that 's so tasteless . 
  it 's some eerie faux baroque shit that i ca n't even look at . 
  it 's simple . 
  because russia is the aggressor . 
  it 's true to some extent though . 
  he should have said `` people who praise russia unconditionally just because they 're bombing isis '' . 
  read a summary of the early months of the conflict , perhaps primary sources ( i could send you some ) . 
  nobody 's asking russia to stop supporting syria . 
  we should n't be needlessly vengeful like turkey , and accept some kind of compromise in syria , and recognize it 's a traditional ally not worth cold warring over . 
  and i 'm saying this as a very pro nato/eu person . 
  some reasonable people are just remarking that picking between mr mass murder assad and isis means losing in different ways . 
  russia should help assad make a transition . 
  sooner or later he 'll have to understand most syrians want no more assad . 
  russia should get back some other ba ` thists in power , without western influence preferably through democratic means or this will be another israel-tier long conflict . 
  edited, 
  they 're inferior in all aspects to most of the western european members too , at least technologically . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being that . 
  how is that an ad hominem ? 
  i did n't mean to say it as if it would invalidate your opinion . 
  of course it does n't . 
  my arguments were below . 
  your whole comment history is anti-nato/anti-american ( irrationally so , not valid criticism ) .
