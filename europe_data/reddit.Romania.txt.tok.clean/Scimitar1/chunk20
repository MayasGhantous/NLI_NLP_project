  he did n't even need to step down . 
  he could 've done what tunisia , oman or jordan did . 
  * the protesters ' demands until 7 april ( 2011 ) were predominantly democratic reforms , release of political prisoners , more freedom , abolition of the emergency law and an end to corruption . 
  * ** most did n't even ask for ba'athists / assad to step down and the voices of extremists were still low . 
  ** but surprise surprise , when you start air-to-ground strikes on ** fucking unarmed protesters ** people might get extremist . 
  and some officials in the syrian army do n't fancy using deadly force on their own ** unarmed conationals ** , so they 'll defect ( to fsa ) . 
  and the rest is history . . 
  so what 's turkey 's fault that assad is a mass murderer ? 
  existing ? 
  existing in anatolia ? 
  and what 's this about `` taking , taking '' ? 
  nobody bailed out any eastern european country during the crisis . 
  we paid our debts . 
  we meet all commitements in timely fashion , financial , political or otherwise . 
  some immigrants ( mind you , that do n't want to impose sharia in areas of your country ) are a nice price to pay for making us a huge market for your western products and annihilating local production . 
  instead of having any kind of input , we are supposed to just accept merkel 's dictate `` take more refugees ? '' . 
  no thanks . 
  you ca n't stop or prevent domestic terrorism with the strength of your conventional armed forces . 
  it 's a job for intelligence services . 
  extreme defensive measures like in the us definitely work , but at the cost of civil liberties . 
  and i 'm not sure europe is in a situation where that 's worth it . 
  ** respect france ** . 
  and regardless of stupid stereotypes and such , france is both more willing and more able to use force in defense of western/european interests than most countries ( probably only second to us and britain ) . 
  how is his/her comparison irrational ? 
  prolonging a `` good '' inevitable , also . 
  that is why american stimulus is working and determining a huge amount of growth , while europe remains stagnant with this obsession with deficits . 
  greece has scared everyone into stagnation . 
  if they also start spending the quantitative easing money with welfare and immigration instead of investment in infrastructure ( or anything job creating ) , the same phenomenon will continue . 
  the reality is , supported by analysts and academics , that the current eu economy is very resilient and some risks should be taken to incentivize growth . 
  this is between nato and poland , not eu and poland . 
  nobody sane thinks it was intentional . 
  but it was perpetrated by russian soldiers . 
  or do you think it was the cia ? 
  how deluded are putinbots ? 
  sorry , i spoke harshly . 
  i have no war against `` ethnic hungarians '' ( my family name is hungarian , on female line i 'm descended from szaszok traders ) nor do i believe there 's any serious threat of ethnic unrest in romania . 
  but i ca n't help but notice a certain agenda . 
  i 'm just wondering . 
  do you honestly not believe the official reports ? 
  i know it 's hard to think that there might be some with terrorist tendencies ( on account of ... well , hungarians never doing shit like that usually ) . 
  which is why hungary is russia 's trojan horse in the heart of europe . 
  dictators of a feather flock together . 
  obviously i did n't mean to say even a majority of hungarians think like this . 
  but their minorities in other countries ? 
  that 's another story . 
  well , they wanted salvation from european institutions and influence - why are n't they enjoying it ? 
  maybe you should n't be a useless anarchist ? 
  living in a probably developed country , in the best time in the world to be a human by every metric . 
  rush hours is hell ? 
  these people probably had their families bombed , repeatedly . 
  if i found this shit on any of your profiles as your employer , i 'd fire your demanding subversive ass pronto . 
  western leftists are completely removed from reality , living in their little bubble of prosperity and security . 
  fascist mindset , revisionism , believing they have a right to other people 's territories even though those territories voluntarily seceded , etc. 
  it was n't an east vs west argument or anything like that . 
  i was just saying how unilateral disarnment does n't work . 
  and europe has been decreasing its conventional capabilities year by year by year , even though rivals like russia are pumping more and more money into `` defense '' . 
  one day , the gap might close , and western powers wo n't have hegemony anymore . 
  now that 's when we done fucked up . 
  really , what 's the reason poland ** should n't ** push for acquiring nukes ? 
  just op probably . 
  because he ca n't stand the truth that some hungarian extremists might employ terrorist tactics , although every single piece of evidence and every official authority points to this fact . 
  butthurt hungarians , got their terrorist arrested and they 're downvoting everyone . 
  although every single piece of evidence shows that it was rightful . 
  and it 's a very worrying development because it signifies a paradigm change . 
  hungarian extremists absolutely never employ violent tactics , at least from what i know of history - i 've not heard of hungarian terrorists . 
  at least in romania , they do n't cause any kind of unrest and although their message sucks , they 've kept to civil discourse . 
  i hope it 's just an isolated case , but i ca n't help but fear the future . 
  they simply wo n't get it that they ca n't have their oppressive empire back . 
  it will never happen . 
  we must show ourselves just as willing to start ww3 as our enemies . 
  that 's the only way ww3 does n't happen . 
  that 's mad . 
  unilateral disarming only leads to instability . 
  look how it worked for ukraine . 
  i 'm all for bilateral nuclear disarming though . 
  i think the more nukes there are ( maybe this does n't apply to russia , the us and europe - rational actors ) there 's more of a chance that one might end up in the paws of a rogue state or organization . 
  yes , that sketch exemplifies perfectly the main issue of the western military establishment : unwillingness to employ or display force - even when your interests ( or even security ) are threatened . 
  as they should . 
  the aegis anti-ballistic shields built in romania and poland are the most advanced anti-icbm technology . 
  contrary to what 's written in the media , their trajectories for which they have greatest effect are for missiles with downward trajectories to the shield . 
  though i do n't envision this becoming ever tactical ( it 's crazy to think the world has got that crazy ... yet ) , mingling offensive and defensive ballistic technology would be a great strategic expansion of nato defense and maybe even a political tool . 
  i do n't see why turkey should be entrusted with keeping warheads more than poland . 
  you have to be mentally challenged or a fascist from hvim to believe he 's innocent . 
  even udmr distanced themselves from these crazies . 
  in the intercepted conversation as they were being under surveillance , they were discussing how this would be `` just experience '' for further , greater terrorist attacks . 
  also the whole remote controlled makeshift detonator and bombs found at his place . 
  but it 's good not to get inflamed before the convictions , it 's only reasonable . 
  these people think it 's a whole complotist plan by the jews . 
  read some stuff from the hvim website or similar secessionist hungarian ngos . 
  they 're also not at all supported by most magyars in romanian , who vote for udmr , which is a moderate party that has distanced themselves from these terrorists . 
  i wish the hungarian media in budapest would do the same . 
  do you think there 's any chance he 's not guilty ? 
  sure , i do n't think the public opinion should get rash until he 's convicted , but there 's no chance he wo n't be convicted . 
  surveiled conversations ( the parts that have been leaked to the media ) between him and other hvim members clearly discuss this as `` getting experience '' for further terrorist attacks . 
  they also found a makeshift detonation device and explosives in his home . 
  i 'm sure that his hungarian neighbours , probably similarly radicalized , are more trustworthy than prosecutors . 
  from the published intercepted talks of him and other members of hvim , they were talking about how this would be `` just training '' for future terrorist attacks . 
  there is absolutely no doubt he will be convinced , and no rational argument why he would n't be . 
  just because some 800 radicalized youth in ts are supporting him is even more sign of a problem . 
  if it was some local county police poking their nose , i would have suspected xenophobia .
