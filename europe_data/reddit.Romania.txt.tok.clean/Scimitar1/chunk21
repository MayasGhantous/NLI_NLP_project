  though this has never happened before in romania - hungarians falsely accused of extremism , or even accused of extremism judicially . 
  but these people had been under surveillance for a while , and prosecutors gathered a lot of evidence . 
  they found a damned remote controlled makeshift detonation device . 
  it would also be insane to claim that the ( very recently successful ) secret services and some diicot have some kind of agenda . 
  again , this has never happened and you 'd be hard pressed to come up with examples , even going back many decades . 
  these people are crazy . 
  udmr ( the hungarian party in the romanian parliament ) distanced themselves from them , for good reason . 
  hvim ( and all these fascist organizations ) do not even support udmr or regionalization/autonomy , they 're full revisionist , calling for a transylvanian invasion . 
  if that 's the people you support with these conspiracy theories , then good luck . 
  you gon na need it . 
  how does russia expand like an empire ? 
  in only 5 years , russia has lost its foremost north african ally , libya . 
  syria is in ruins and ukraine got ripped forever from the russian sphere of influence , getting from the deal only what they already had ( sevastopol ) also they 're in a recession . 
  my country could cause a lot of miscalculated unrest in moldova but that does n't make us an empire . 
   peia 's scenario was analysed by the social democrat channel romaina tv . 
  the ** intellectual ** guests all of my keks . 
  well , some of these people are inflamed a bit because a hungarian ultranationalist tried to blow up a parade recently , but these conspiratards are not taken seriously by anyone . 
  i never heard of this mp . 
  it 's the us influence that ended communism and contributed to lifting eastern european countries out of communist slavery . 
  it 's us defense spending that allowed western european countries to invest massively in social welfare and administrative efficiency , evolving the highest standards of living seen in history . 
  also , you know , the marshall plan . 
  these are not comfortable truths , but here we are . 
  the reality is , in the present day , europe is more of a burden for an overextended america that 's turning more and more isolationist , or at least focused on asia . 
  i ca n't wait to see the eu come crawling to washington when chinese corporations and institutions creep their way in southern eu towards political influence . 
  your progress is tied to russia . 
  they helped you greatly in the 90s , right ? 
  america gives you the most foreign aid , because you 're a beggar country , a failure of history . 
  russia gives nothing , yet you still suck them off . 
  serbian logic : ) ) you will remain in your poverty and unimportance . 
  does n't it feel bad when all of your neighbors ( the ones you did n't attempt to eradicate ) are doing better than serbs by any meters ? 
  ( economy , security ), 
  you need to get over the past . 
  it 's such a pity serbians have this jingoism . 
  it wo n't get you far . 
  and i love serbia and serbian people ( most romanians do ) sooner or later you 'll understand that the only path to progress is integrating with western institutions . 
  western allies prosper . 
  non-western aligned countries do n't . 
  see : eastern europe , the middle east , south east asia . 
  not as a `` vassals '' but as a partners . 
   russia  empire is italy an empire ? 
  italy projects a lot of power in the mediteraneean and in the eu , and has the gdp of russia . 
  also a much more solid and diversified economy . 
  just like russia , it used to be an empire . 
  russia is an ordinary petrostate , with primacy in the world not too far from saudi arabia . 
  multipolarity is a myth of idealistic anti-americans . 
  good luck with that ^_^, 
  anti ballistic technology is progressing fast , and only in western countries . 
  we 're nowhere near being able to shoot down a lot of icbm 's , but who knows in 10 years . 
  lasers are already being deployed with capacity to intercept slow projectiles . 
  should n't you be living off american aid and sucking off russia ? 
  actually never mind , that 's what you 're doing ... 
  i truly do n't care much . 
  i 'm a staunch anti-socialist , but i 've voted for social democrats and rather thought their policies were successful . 
  if only we 'd have a world where economy is rid of ideology . 
  redistributive measures can work exceptionally , and if the society of a country democratically manifests their desire to live in a more equal society as a priority , that 's totally okay . 
  as long as property remains sacred . 
  also nordic countries employ a lot of measures to stimulate small businesses ( multinationals too ) . 
  like , seriously , in norway you can get state provided litigation in so many corporate cases ; they get taxed a lot but corporatations get a shitload of benefits too - especially the happy workforce . 
  but also a healthy amount of inequality is not necessarily satan or inherently bad . 
  i do n't believe in trickle down economics , but i can see why wildly successful economies ( let 's be honest now , the captains of industry in science , it , finance , defense - are mostly in america ) tend to become unequal , even though the standards of living are raising for everyone . 
  it 's much easier to make a lot of money if you . . have a lot of money . 
  because that 's the leftist arrogance . 
  even though there 's plenty of unregulated successful economies ( with much higher populations than their super small scandinavian countries ) , they believe their adopting their system , hostage of unions and statist bureaucracy is the supreme purpose of all of mankind . 
  do n't get me wrong , they are wonderful places , with healthier , more eductaed and more stable societies than almost anywhere else on earth . 
  but some people would rather work hard for a lifetime to build a career and be ** rich ** ( as in , relative to their communities ) rather than work hard for a lifetime and build a career to earn as much as a taxi driver . 
  let us be realistic , current western leaders are weak as hell , but they would n't let china dictate the voluntary nato adhesion of candidate states . 
  i rather agree with you in principle , but it 's this kind of attitude that makes people hate americans . 
  you 're obviously a far-leftist drone building a caricature of straws , i 'm just addressing you `` in character '' so to say . 
  if anyone thinks this guy is for real , i pity you . 
   somalia or saudi arabia or ireland , the highest human development in the world and lowest corporate tax rate in europe . 
  this is ultimately a matter of morals , to me at least . 
  unregulated economies can be successful in different ways , or successful in the same ways as social democratic ones . 
  it rather depends if policies are implemented correctly and the state is free of corruption . 
  i personally would rather live in the us than any scandinavian country ( ca n't wait to finally move to the us ) . 
  what 's the point in living a comfortable life if you ca n't be richer than most of your peers ? 
  i do n't want to put the hard work and ambition and luck to achieve a great career just to earn not significantly more than a plumber . 
  some people crave relative wealth , and i think that 's more conductive to progress than dragging along leeches comfortably . 
  there should certainly be a safety net , but not so much that it stifles the desire to work . 
  although that does n't seem to be the case in scandinavian societies , maybe it 's not an actual phenomenon , i do n't know . 
  sorry , i 've read enough men 's rights activism to suspect the worst . 
  all these groups are the same kind of cunts , imo . 
  blackmail what ? 
  do you honestly think the ukrainian government is that retarded ? 
  there is absolutely no chance in hell crimea will be a part of ukraine again . 
  not even kim jong un would think this would work . 
  also , none of the recent ukrainian discourse has been about crimea , but about the east . 
  everyone rather accepted it as a fait accompli . 
  i was frankly very surprised and suspected some shenanigans when i heard about the power cuts . 
  especially because crimea was paying , and ukraine needs the money . 
  defending national interests is not ideology , just reason . 
  you can argue about the kremlin 's miscalculations and expectations of no western response , but that does n't make their actions irrational . 
  trust me , i 'm not pro-russian by any stretch of the word ( my comment history  .  ) but calling moscow crazy and ideology fueled is wrong . 
  people want a quick resolution to the syrian crisis . 
  of course curbing the global terrorist phenomenon is a very slow and complicated process , but stability in syria may be achieved much quicker than ... you know , ending islamic terrorism . 
  pkk kurds ? 
  not bombed enough . 
  no worries , they 've done their share of bombing in turkey for many decades now . 
  ** the cost of buying gas that is n't russian will outweigh the benefits ** russian economy is almost completely dependent on exporting energy . 
  what makes you so sure europe will come crawling back , when we have the upper hand on deals ? 
  even with all the rt propaganda about fracking , there 's many viable ways for europe to diversify its input .
