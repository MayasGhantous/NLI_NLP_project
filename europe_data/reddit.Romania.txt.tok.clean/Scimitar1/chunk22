  yes , tolerance of people with hiv . 
  not gay people . 
  there 's nothing about gay rights in his message . 
  a large number of hiv cases in russia are due to their heroin epidemic and that 's mainly what they 're trying to address . 
  but of course not with methadone treatment , which has been proven effective in countless studies . 
  oh noes , we ca n't let this filthy druggies take pills !, 
  more decadence and exclusion masquerading as `` tolerance '', 
  turkey has been bombing isis for longer than russia . 
  just putinbots being putinbots . 
  driving a rift between turkey and nato would be ideal for russian plans . 
  the moment it appears , they will be bffs in a second . 
  just because poland is smart and invests in defense does n't mean they neglect welfare . 
  ** stop lying ** . 
  it 's so misleadingly untrue it should n't be taken seriously . 
  [ welfare spending as part of the budget is 20 % . 
  military spending is literally an order of magnitude lower . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare_in_poland ), 
  i stand corrected then . 
  you would not believe how many people are antisemitic , especially in europe . 
  and how casually . 
  just browse r/worldnews . 
  it 's also amazing how many people have never met jews , yet they 're completely batshit crazy about them . 
  nothing much has changed in the general mentality of european masses since the 2nd century ( when it pertains to jews ) . 
  people feel threatened by a culture that espouses ** superior values ** : as hard work , focus on family , ambition , entrepreneurship - like jews . 
  they feel threatened that jews are such a big part of finance , politics and the media ( because they simply pursue these fields more than most ) . 
  nobody feels threatened by the fact koreans dominate engineering in america , but somehow if there 's a lot of jews in the senate , that 's a world conspiracy . 
  all the apparent power that jewish communities have ( especially in america where the phenomenon is clear ) is due to the fact ** jews go to law school . 
  a lot . 
  ** that 's really it . 
  perusing statistics , i have not found much that would ascribe the poland with the title of `` most antisemitic '' . 
  their levels of antisemitism are apparently close to france , though a lot of poles believe in silly conspiracy theories . 
  [ meanwhile , greece , the most antisemitic country in europe , has a populace whose general opinion of jews is on par with saudi arabia . 
  ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.591841 ) i know it 's tempting to derive generalizations from a video of 20 crazy assholes , but do n't make blanket statements about entire societies based on it . 
  edit : apparently poland is indeed very antisemitic . 
  when googling such stats , orgs seem to focus a lot more on western european antisemitism . 
  i was expecting a mentality different from my own country for some reason , but apparently not ... * sighs * never change slavs the matter still stands . 
  these people are not a representation of the general . 
  there 's a big difference between burning symbols and answering something slightly antisemitic in a poll . 
  while western europe had the luxury of spending generously on social welfare under the blanket of american defense spending for half a century , eastern countries have a lot of a gap to make up for . 
  also , all these studies with misleading headlines ... 
  i ca n't comprehend anyone starving in romania , and i dont think there have been cases of such poverty in many years . 
  it 's even more unlikely about poland . 
  [ these organizations ] ( http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,1033781,title,ubostwo-w-polsce-wedlug-gus-w-ponad-5-proc-gospodarstw-domowych-brakuje-na-jedzenie,wid,18018681,wiadomosc.html ) usually take into account criteria specifically designed for fully industrialized , 80 % + urban western countries . 
  . . while in eastern europe , a large proportion of the rural population lives comfortably off self sufficient farming , though that does n't show up in those statistics . 
  it 's true , many can not * afford * a full balanced diet , but it 's also true they do not acquire their basic needs from the economy . 
  i know how they worked those statistics in romania , and though they are methodologically sound , they present a misleading picture . 
  it is absurd to claim 5 % of poles are ** fucking starving ** in a country with very high human development index , and just not true . 
  go to r/russia . 
  read some comments . 
  i respect these people . 
  and the only way to defeat them is to adopt their worldview . 
  especially of their leaders . 
  mostly because you seemed to imply foreign action was the main catalyst , which it was n't . 
  it was the will of the ukrainian people . 
  when you have mass protests , ** there must be concessions ** from the government . 
  recently a club burned down here and there were mass protests in bucharest against corruption . 
  protests got a slight bit larger , then the government stepped down . 
  that 's what it means to have a functional democracy - something which will never , sadly , exist east of the eu . 
  there is , of course , a line between constitutional democracy and mobs ousting a government . 
  a revolution of . . well , almost everyone , is far beyond a coup , but a manifestation of massive popular will . 
  just like in crimea . 
  in the grand scheme of things , all that matters is the us , the uk and eastern europe - which will never fall into the russian sphere of influence again . 
  i 'd see myself and everyone i know die gladly if that 's prevented from happening , and a surprising amount of people think like that - no matter how much you putinbots keep waging your hybrid war . 
  slava ukraini . 
  coup , are you insane ? 
  do you comprehend how anti-russian the ukrainians and how much popular support the revolution had , even in russian speaking areas ( excepting the far east ) ? 
  somehow the democratic manifestation of the crimean people should be taken into consideration , but not that of ukrainians . 
  why ca n't you putinbots get it in your heads that free trade with the eu and integration with western institutions has brought only good for eastern european countries ? 
  ukrainians would rather be a partner to the eu than a vassal to russia . 
  but , as usual , our spineless leaders have betrayed them . 
  i do n't feel , ethically , very revolted by the annexation of crimea though . 
  it is , undoubtedly , russian . 
  ** that does n't excuse you from propagating these ridiculous lies . 
  germans signing a pact with moscow to undermine eastern europe ? 
  again ? 
  who would have thought . 
  i think you misunderstood . 
  what i meant to say it legitimizes turkey 's action ( but i still think it 's needlessly reckless , though the su did not have a transponder and they had reasons to think it was syrian ) . 
  does in my eyes . 
  they 've absolutely overstepped the geneva convention and i do not condone their actions . 
  given the situation in syria , the assymetrical war , everything that 's been happening - i still find it hard to feel ethically against them . 
  and calling it an atrocity is a big exaggeration . 
  when you 're at the executive head of the most powerful military organization in history , ** predictability is a quality ** . 
  he 's not a flashy politician making reckless declarations when deescalation is absolutely necessary . 
  yes , killing those who 've bombed them . 
  sure it was reckless to fire atas at it , but it 's almost insane to think it did n't cross turkey 's airspace . 
  ** russia does that all the time ** . 
  kbg propaganda works very well on reddit , so people do n't know those facts . 
  they just take mass murderes ' assad words at face value . 
  it 's interesting how much public opinion can be changed by kbgs hybrid war . 
  2-3 years ago , ** before isis got big in the media , everyone on reddit was almost irrationally anti-assad . 
  ** it 's kind of amusing . 
  what exactly do you have against the turkmen rebels , you know , people who do n't want to get killed by isis ? 
  please tell me how are they terrorists . 
  do you morons even comprehend the attitude of isis towards the turkmen and fsa ? 
  if isis got that far north , the turkmen would suffer the same faith as the yazidis . 
  i 'd much rather have the fsa and turkmen win in syria than assad . 
  atrocities ? 
  please , give me an example . 
  because it 's what happened ?
