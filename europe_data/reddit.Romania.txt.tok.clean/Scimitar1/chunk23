  have you read the wikileaks document ? 
  that 's moronic . 
  i guess that 's the softness of nordics . 
  completely off-topic from the thread - if anyone threatens my family on my property , or even just the property , i will take every measure in my power to neutralize that threat . 
  i 'm pretty sure every sane person would . 
  yes ? 
  they have very diverging interests in syria , having maintained good public shows of friendliness between each other because they 're both led by authoritarian regimes . 
  beyond buying some oil off of them ( no official reports , just some allegations , let 's take them at face value for the sake of your argument ) ... what else ? 
  except that sweden is in countless bilateral defense agreements with nato , or through third parties , like the eu . 
  do you really think a country which is so integrated in nato command structures , which took part in joint ops , is being * probed * by nato ? 
  it is hypocrisy , but that does n't make their actions wrong . 
  they wo n't let isis be defeated except ... they 're bombing them every week . 
  do you have any idea what isis would do is their territory extended to the syrian turkmen ? 
  just because turkey does n't like assad does n't mean it wants ethnic turks genocided . 
  just because turkey hates assad does n't mean they have n't been bombing isis for many months longer than russia . 
  isis said it would do the same to the turkmen in syria as they 've done on the yazidis . 
  turkey is a burden to nato ? 
  do you know anything about geopolitics ? 
  turkey has much more of a hand in winning the cold war than any european nation , and the anatolian peninsula is probably the most strategically important region on earth in 2015 . 
  '' ** turkey is more of an enemy to us than russia . 
  ** '' are you genuinely crazy ? 
  serious question . 
  not only turkey is an ally to the eu through a lot of bilateral agreements ; you 're comparing turkey to russia , a country which is openly and declaredly hostile to the eu , with which we have diverging interests ( unlike turkey ) , which is also waging a hybrid war of mass disinformation and financing fascist parties on eu soil ( fn ) . 
  '' ** made possible by turkey ** '' are you ** really ** insane ? 
  seriouser question . 
  [ turkish intelligence fucking warned france a few days before . ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/live/paris-attacks-live-updates/turkey-warned-french-twice-about-attacker-official-says/ ) . 
  ** were the paris attacks made possible by belgium because the guns passed through there too ? 
  ** i would fight for turkey . 
  i 'm sure many would n't , and that 's understandble , but the reason the western world is safe and a big reason the cold war has been won is the loyal attitude of turks and the stability of the alliances we 've built . 
  even though us europeans have given them the finger at every opportunity for eu accession . 
  the reason they have such a conservative government is in no small part the fault of european diplomacy . 
  everything you 've ever written in your comment history is anti-european so you 're probably just the average putinbot . 
  sorry i attempted to reason . 
  how many times will nato countries allow their airspace violated ( which actually matters , it probes defenses , response time , the celerity of intelligence services , and more ) before we retaliate ? 
  this is a good start . 
  thankfully , in turkey , spineless diplomats are not in charge of a countries ' security . 
  a country with the gdp of italy does not have the same power projection as even a quarter of nato . 
  the only reason we 're allowing their puppet states ( syria ) to exist is that the western world has become spineless . 
  nukes are out of the question . 
  only proxy wars are n't . 
  and i 'm sure the west can wage one much more sucessfully than russia . 
  i do n't blame americans for getting tired of war . 
  but instead of drawing `` red lines '' and just financing genocidal islamists , the west should have either stayed out of it completely or put boots on the ground . 
  it 's more like the second really . 
  every single time i remember someone saying `` facem haz de necaz '' , i had either failed an exam , a relative was in the hospital or my ex had left me : / i was n't feeling very humorous . 
  true story though . 
  `` have been far far lower by now if they had stopped settlement expansion '' hamas always had popular support , before the blockade too . 
  the region is fundamentally antisemitic . 
  the settlements have to stop though , i 'll give you that . 
  ** `` have a lot of control over their government . 
  '' ** source ? 
  israel is more socially liberal than most european countries . 
  i dont even care about the points the article is making . 
  israel 's government is not one of saints , i have no illusions . 
  but `` start a war every few years '' ? 
  every single time since the 60s , literally every single time , violence has undeniably been initiate by palestinians . 
  the moment israel installed the blockade in 2007 ** virtually all suicide bombings ceased ** ... and they were dealing with a hell of a fucking lot more than europeans . 
  i agree they should be more careful with civillian casualties , and definitely stop the bullshit expansionistic settlements - but most of what israel is doing is ** not for safety , but for survival **, 
  when they installed the blockade , the bombings virtually stopped . 
  that is an undeniable truth . 
  online hipsters a world away have no clue how it is to be surrounded by 4 armed neighbours that suicidally want your complete and utter annihilation ( one of the tennets of hamas , btw ) . 
  regardless , i do n't agree with the article 's proposals . 
  europe is not israel , and not under threat of genocide and destruction , like israel . 
  we ca n't lose our calm and instill draconian policies on knee jerk reactions /, 
  what do they mean `` plans '' ? 
  this has been ongoing , maybe not in full force . 
  why do you think they 're finaning racist parties ( fn , ukip ) / and / communists ( podemos , corbyn ) at the same time ? 
  read the wiki leaks . 
  read breakdowns of casualties . 
  in iraq and afghanistan , and especially afghanistan , most civillian victims become casualities as a direct action of insurgents . 
  schools full of children to take shelter in and use as weapon stashes , ieds killing more villagers in afghanistan than allied troops , that 's how they fight an assymetrical war . 
  you have many examples of us soldiers failing missions because they refused to take action against civilians or positions with civilians nearby . 
  enemy combatants committing mass murder with religious zeal , attempting to be charming ? 
  would you have the same opinion on ss-sturmbrigade dirlewanger ? 
  very similar practices , with the torture , enslavement of women and children [ 1 ] and i 'm a very pro-nato person , and pro-ukrainian , yet i ca n't help to remember how many people were calling for basically deploying droops in crimea . 
  as a consequence of `` gentlemany '' disputes like electoral law , referendums , neither russians nor ukrainian are committing almost any war crimes ( seriously , there was combat , but no mass executions , pows are exchanged , diplomacy 's cogs are spinning ) . 
  euro-american powers like russia and the west always at least try to adhere to some principles of human decency , and some amount of respect and international law . 
  these guys do n't . 
  they should continue to be considered enemy combatants . 
  and why would you risk so many lives in a risky terrestrial op just to capture the pr dude ? 
  this was completely expected from the person who wants to dismantle nato . 
  his discourse always is more anti-nato than the official positions of the kremlin . 
  they do demonstrably exist , at least in the ex - soviet region . 
  have you heard of the arab spring , you fucking ... ? 
  i do n't even have words for this inanity . 
  at least world leaders are not taking it seriously . 
  you keep meaning to tell me that sectarian conflicts going back literally a thousand years before there existed nation states in europe are obama 's fault . 
  you mean to tell me that people would n't have revolted against assad 's rule , possibly one of the most repressive regimes in the whole world , on a completely sectarian basis . 
  the eu did n't let us , so ... 
  yes . 
  and they are . 
  nsa is too . 
  not in the warped minds on the reddit leftist insane hub . 
  none of them are advocating genocide . 
  no feminists , no antiracist activists . 
  they 're just tweets . 
  i prefer sjw to communists / anarchists . 
  thank god many leftists are drawn to this annoying but harmless ideology instead of actually being a danger to society . 
  i 'm in the neighbourhood . 
  apparently i 'm fb friends with some people who attended the event ; there 's some awful fucks posting pics of charred bodies on social media also .
