  it 's the worst disaster here [ since 1995 airbus crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarom_flight_371 ), 
  i 'm glad they 're making profit . 
  i would n't have it any other way . 
  i 'd rather be dead than dependent on russia . 
  16 trillion and actually going down . 
  which is so retarded . 
  they 're dismissing it as if the right that won in poland is somehow similar to orban 's or putin 's , while the pis is much more similar to germany 's own cdu that has been the forefront of the rulling coalition for ** ten years now ** . 
  there is no communism in which you get to keep your private property ( a un recognized basic human right , by the way ) . 
  else they are not communists but differing variants of extreme leftists that i might even vote for myself . 
  and no , communist and nazi parties are expressly banned here . 
  class supremacy or racial supremacy should n't really be a thing in politics , but i suppose western europeans did n't feel the first one much so they do n't think it 's a threat . 
  why are communists even allowed to be elected ? 
  do you want your families homes and cars collectivized to pay for the conservatives debt from the last decade ? 
  i mean , it 's your country and too small to matter , but i still find it weird . 
  so , because the other parties do n't want to form governments with 18 % filthy communists , `` liberty dies '' ? 
  so , they did n't get filthy communists to ruin their country just like greece , especially because most portuguese people are sane ... and that 's somehow germany 's fault ? 
  if there was some suspicion , why did n't they go for a 200 bucks maternity/paternity test ? 
  the only thing you have to worry about is if the device is locked on an american carrier , making you unable to use it with your domestic mobile providers . 
  you can unlock most through jailbreaking , but it might be risky . 
  whether it 's locked or unlocked should be specified in the product descriptition/specifications from wherever you buy it . 
  after all , you must warn others heh, 
  then i 'm glad you and people like you are in no position to decide upon these issues . 
  you see the enemies of the west increasing their defense spending , and the us and nato countries in general decreasing it . 
  not only that it 's irrational because global politics are a zero sum game ( give an inch , a hand will be taken ) , it 's unreasonable because the us just ca n't afford to be isolationist . 
  the american economy depends on the safety of trade routes , the stability of its allies and a free global market . 
  normalizing diplomatic relations with cuba and iran , he inherited two wars and pulled america out of them , leaving afghanistan mostly stable , the drone campaigns annihilated most of the leadership of al qaeda , iju and other terrorist groups preventing pakistan from fates similar to syria without putting boots on the ground , killed osama , the prospect of kurdish statehood , the oil price and possibility of development of russia has been stunted marvelously , the pivots in asia ( especially vietnam ) , and more . 
  anyone that studies international law ( and i did with out current foreign minister ) is aware that obama has been much more successful than he 's given credit for . 
  some americans and europeans wanted a bush-like hawk , and some americans and europeans wanted an insane isolationist , though the obama administration has shown that pragmatism , reason , moderation and realpolitik are the most effective tools , which left most of the media against them . 
  ukraine has also been forever ripped from the russian sphere of influence , which is a big sucess - this is not 2004 , the ukrainian people will not go back to the way things were . 
  and the russians gained nothing they did n't already possess ( sevastopol ) syria is the only real big blunder , as in libya nato had no choice ( benaghazi would have been the scene of a genocide ) . 
  of course washington could not predict or instigate the arab spring , but the choice to arm rebels that appear to be moderate ( you think they would learn from afghanistan ) always ends up nasty . 
  the moment they get some power , wahabbis and salafis go full wahabbi/salafi every time . 
  i wish they just stuck with the iraqi and syrian kurds . 
  downvote all you wish , but the uninformed , kneejerk opinions of populist redditors have little in common with those of specialists and decision makers . 
  that 's really only germany and maybe the netherlands . 
  norway is a very important hub of defense research and arms export , france has shown it takes its comitements very seriously at the cost of billions and will continue to do so ( seeing as les r\u00e9publicains will probably win in 2017 ) , same applies for the uk and eastern europe . 
  only a putinbot would view us presence in europe as imperialist - and of course some germans do , in the tradition of schroder/die linke and other corporate leaders in the pocket of the kremlin . 
  of course germans need the cheap oil to ensure their corporate domination of europe . 
  i for one want a free , united and defended europe not one where eastern europeans are being sold to the russian sphere of influence in secret pacts with germany ( as it tends to happen historically ) nato is exactly the opposite of bloated . 
  we are letting ourselves become vulnerable with outrageously low defense spending - eastern europeans are very guilty of that too , and so is the us in the past few years . 
  but the good thing is nobody listens to extreme leftists and they do n't have popular support ( because most people are sane ) and nato will probably keep expanding , starting with montenegro . 
  beyond the irrational anti-americanism of western europeans , like i said , people are still sane , and [ know who the enemy is ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/1-nato-public-opinion-wary-of-russia-leary-of-action-on-ukraine/ ), 
  most of the leftist and conservative media has been mounted against her . 
  beyond the fact she has almost the exact same voting record as sanders on domestic issues ( she 's close to a democratic socialist ) , and is careless with her data , what 's there to dislike about clinton ? 
  that she would continue obama 's rather successful foreign policy and would n't take america out of nato like sanders , dooming the free world to unrest and russian expansionism ? 
  obviously . 
  these stupid mitics , right ? 
  this sight would never behoove the glorious transylvanian master race . 
  the rose . 
  yes . 
  fuck trump too and his corporatocratic ideas . 
  as much as i hate to say it , there 's no sane choice for america except for clinton . 
  not if you guys vote a pinko like sanders as the leader of the free world . 
  pisa includes a lot of shit that does n't pertain to performance . 
  of course a country where a student is likely to live indebted through his college years and many after will rank lower in `` comfort '' or some other shit like that . 
  but performance and achievements are what matters . 
  yes , it 's different - it 's inferior . 
  there are standardized statistics which determine those things , and american students excel which is why america contains the hubs of development in most everything . 
  most advanced medical research and development , it , engineering and in science tied with the eu . 
  they 're not traitors . 
  this is their job . 
  protecting german interests through any means . 
  ** you ** and the likes of you ( or snowden ) are traitors , by every definition . 
  they still rank better in performance than europeans by every statistic . 
  it 's probably just your european superiority complex . 
  as opposed to the `` good side '' of moldova ? 
  this guy is a communist joke who held syriza hostage , managed to crash the banking sector in two weeks and incurred much more debt for greece than would have been the case if tsipras was allowed to negotiate without communists keeping him on a leash . 
  and he 's such an egomaniac narcissist too . 
  in every interview , in every blog post - he posesses the supreme truths that will change europe . 
  just like `` banks will be open on tuesday '', 
  that 's because you are a scandinavian leftist wishing the destruction and degradation of the western world . 
  saudi arabia is a pole of stability in the middle east , and a rather propserous country . 
  they are also progressing on social issues . 
  just like any islamic theocracy , it can never be held to the same standards as western democracies . 
  a lot of the articles ( lies ) about saudis financiang that group or that other group are misrepresentations of reality . 
  the house of saud has 15.000 members , and lot of those are extremely rich people which happen to be also virulent wahabbis . 
  there is absolutely no evidence that the ** saudi government ** is financing terrorist groups , but it 's more than certain a lot of saudi princes do it from their own money . 
  meanwhile , russia is waging a hybrid media war attempting to disrupt european unity to establish a sphere of influence ( maybe outright invasion ) of eastern europe - not in the near future , but the plans are clear . 
  it would be absolute insanity for poland to continue to let itself strongarmed by russia through energy dependency . 
  i would much prefer those lng terminals would prioritize canada and the us ( for refined petroleum ) and especially more of a push in eastern europe for getting rid of fossil fuels entirely . 
  but given this state of affairs , opec countries are the best alternative for now . 
  because he probably had terrorist tendencies beforehand or was a combatant . 
  kek . 
  not really , it 's a matter of interest - and eastern alignment was very possible up until the end of the 90s . 
  communist romania was pretty independent of russia , and we got occupied ( peacefully ) for a comparatively short timespan when you take into account every other warsaw pact country . 
  also most romanians think moldova would be a liability . 
  go fuck yourself , and do me the satisfaction of dying in the process . 
  we might be poor , but we are n't liabilities ( like pigs ) . 
  nobody bailed us out during the crisis , we 've met all commitments and obligations - and it 's not even the eu policies towards us that bother me , but the shitty , overlord attitude of germany , france , uk and nl . 
  western europeans have had only to gain from this ( we too , really ) , with just having to sacrifice some petty crime increase with gypsy immigrants . 
  fair point . 
  no , just xenophobia . 
  it would n't really make any difference except for businesses ( takes me maybe 40 seconds to cross a checkpoint ) , but western europeans have backwards mentalities . 
  yes . 
  like the official technical criteria . 
  which we 've been meeting for some years now . 
   eurasian economic union maybe it will happen . 
  as a proud russiangovernmentphobe , i 'm still wondering if european integration truly is the way to progress . 
  but on that front you hardly have anything to fear from romanians and bulgarians . 
  hungary and czechia though ... you should be careful what you wish for and how you push them around .
