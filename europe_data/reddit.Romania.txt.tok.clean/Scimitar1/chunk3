  hippie fucking useful idiots ruining another avenue of growth for my country . 
  i hate these ecofascists so fucking much . 
  how exactly has romania 's `` cultural spaces been devoted to old fashion politics '' ? 
  awful , right ? 
  look how bad all these members of nato are doing in eastern europe compared to moldova http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index, 
  do you have any conception of how mentally challenged you are ? 
  i know dreams of the collapse of western civilization are jerk off material for alex jones types like you , but you could at least say / something / factual . 
  i 'm not even going to read all of that . . 3 trillion in irak ? 
  with the 2014 american public ? 
  a few jdams , surveillance and maybe a ballistic missle or two should only serve as training for minimal costs , improving the proficiency of us navy/air operations . 
  read some military analysts ( foreignpolicy.com , meade , mearseheimer ) . 
  us `` occupation '' in germany . . ok . 
  i stopped reading there . 
  russians tend to be smart , subversive and personable . 
  why are russophiles retarded though ? 
  but they were all super fine with it during those golden days of militaristic expansion and ethnic cleansing of 1939-1941 . 
  i 'm tired of these socialist blogs , perhaps attempting to distract people from the failures of the leftist economic model in france ? 
  who knows . 
  it 's only certain they ca n't publish in reputable journals because nobody takes this r/conspiracy shit seriously . 
  stop advertising it here , mr/mrs author . 
  only met an american abroad and it was n't pleasant . 
  the thing is : i form my opinions in a logical framework , idependent of experiences , biases , prejudices . 
  your phobia of americans is so ingrained it 's started rejecting the simple expression of their point of view . 
  might i add also these are the same americans , as stereotypical as it sounds , that have been providers of freedom and security here for half a century as your empire was/is crumbling . 
  ignore those hipsters with superiority complexes . 
  yanks are welcome here , in every sense of the word . 
  you were very welcome too , when yanks were defending western europe and allowing its welfare spending to floursih without the economic burden of having to keep external threats at bay . 
  but people forget . . . . oh wait . 
  that 's still happening . 
  i do n't think anyone wants to pretend to be european . 
  now you should kindly stop using technology that 's the fruit of american scientific inovation , maybe give back a little to the treasury of the strong military that defended europe and allowed it to invest in social welfare without defense budget burdens for half a century . 
  fucking european superiority complex can suck my balls .

  fucking european superiority complex can suck my balls . 
  yeah , just like germany , japan , south korea , countries where the chicago boys went , literally every single easten european nation which became part of nato or eu institutionally after the collapse of soviet influence . 
  ... [ whom are / all / now better places to live than russia itself ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) i wonder if ukraine would be better off integrated in that system , rather than a russian puppet . 
  hmm . . b-but but jews , gays , bush , bankers : < i thought the west was evil . 
  `` sick '' is only an adjective in english and it needs a noun , silly op . 
  this language is absurd . 
  basescu took a very strong stance a month ago with the malay airlines tragedy , calling the whole endeavor in east ukraine a ** hybrid war ** he 's ex-military and has some good advisors . 
  he has n't changed his stance , thank god - i think the dude is just speaking of the realities in the field and that there has n't been a genuine escalation in the situation . 
  it 's always been grave . 
  nobody cares about russian interests and positions because in reality , russia does n't really have the power to push them . 
  you might seriously lose your influence in fucking ukraine , which has never happened in history . 
  your own backyard . 
  because you 're not capable of playing ball . 
  how does that feel ? 
  good for me . 
  nato won . 
  and it keeps winning . 
  and it will keep winning . 
  nah , it 's too full of russkies already . 
  oopsie , in 2014 , romania has overtaken russia in terms of [ human development ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) ( sidenote : why the fuck is n't the un calculating with data from this year , which would drop russia much lower ? ), 
  how does it feel when literally every single country that has escaped your sphere of influence since the 90s is better off than it was under soviet rule , ** and ** better off than mommy russia itself ? 
  how does it feel to have the gdp of france , a little higher than the gdp of texas , and much more than twice the population ? 
  keep drinking the kool-aid of imperialist ambitions and you will continue to be isolated . 
  face it , people simply do not desire russian dominance . 
  russia does n't have a right to a sphere of influence more than the eu does . 
  either way , i 'm happy to see our derpy most-likely-future-president ponta continuing basescu 's surprisingly assertive foreign policy . 
  that 's because russia today / soros and useful idiots like micheal moore have done their job well . 
  at least in my country they have . 
  http://rt.com/search/everywhere/term/fracking/ < -- hmm , i * wonder * if they have an agenda . 
  romania is completely independent of russian gas . 
  do your research , editor . 
  indigenous production this year was at over 100 % . 
  i think romania is the only country on that list that really has the luxury to keep the environment as the end-all priority of energy policy . 
  it 's a dream to imagine our retarded leaders might embrace fracking and make romania an exporter , with actual power projection and ambition to ** make others dependent on the eu ** not the other way around . 
  ambition ? 
  in the eu ? 
  in fucking romania ? 
  nah , it 's 2014 , we 've all got comfortable . 
  elections to win , bribes from gazprom to gorge on , hippies to appease ... 
  your comment has to be satire , right ? 
  i think the reason they would n't engage russian contingents beyond their border is that they are not ** fucking suicidal ** your comment reeks of kremlin propaganda . 
  when will people understand that the rational interests of everyone are in contradiction with russia 's ? 
  when that happens , we 'll finally have europeans and americans taking a proper stand . 
  i 'm sure the cia did it . 
  how could the superhuman freedomfighters armed by kremlin ever miscalculate the use of force ? 
  like starting the whole war over half of the country and then being reduced to 3 cities in 2 months . 
  it 's absurd . 
  are you serious or are you being sarcastic ? 
  i refuse to believe someone could be so ignorant of these countries ' evolution over the past ten years ( and romania , and bulgaria , and the baltics ) directly owed to eu funds and economic integration . 
  hey . 
  you replied to me in a thread about russia and i checked your comment history . 
  i 'm a law student and i had firm beliefs about this . 
  i think you changed my mind on welfare . 
  i already agreed that sanctions increased/will increase putin 's popularity . 
  do you comprehend how isolated and chauvinistic the media in an authoritarian state ? 
  it truly is alien to everything you 've been exposed to , i assure you from experience . 
  the false equivalencies between cnn and russia today ( rt is extremely moderate compared to internal russian press ) so often repeated on reddit are simply that , fallacies . 
  there is absolutely no chance the current russian population , with their culture , values , and heck , rational interests , will ever want anything but an assertive autocrat as their leader . 
  changing a public opinion as homogenous as russia 's is not a realistic goal . 
  economic pressure is . 
  there is nothing else between words and military action if you want to bring pressure upon a government , and we are faced with the necessity to pressure . 
  most recent sanctions have been imposed on irrational actors ( terrorist organizations and such ) . 
  just because they have n't worked in the past , does n't mean they wo n't now . 
  the fact eastern ukraine is not invaded yet to me is a sign they are working . 
  have we really forgotten crimea ? 
  maybe because it because it was such a swift move , imperialist in a baffling manner ... really 19th century-y .
