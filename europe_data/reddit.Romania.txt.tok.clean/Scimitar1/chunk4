  it 's foolish to think they wo n't annex again if given leeway . 
  and if it matters ( it does n't ) - the decrease of corruption at every level in my country is mostly owed to dna ; a judicial entity whose creation was imposed by nato in 2005 . 
  we 've had prime ministers jailed , two of the richest 5 oligarchs , plenty other high up people affiliated with ** all ** political parties , in about 3 years . 
  it 's not relevant to the argument and i 'm sure you do n't care - but you brought it up , and as with everything else , you were wrong . 
  actually , [ romania has a higher development index than russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) the [ fastest economic growth in the eu apart from germany and poland ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2013/12/what-britain-forgets ) but yes , i agree , it is a shithole , compared to what it could have been by now . 
  why do they use the foreign debt figures from 2012 for romania , which is at half as of july 2014 . ? 
  i 'll never know . 
  i guess the un just does n't give a shit about eastern europe . 
  or rigour . 
  why does russia has the same global democracy index in 2014 ? 
  again , the bric bias of the un hdi comission is always clear . 
  i 'm sorry that i have n't had a privileged enough life for you . 
  i 'm sure that renders my arguments invalid . 
  but the facts remain : is it any coincidence that ** every single ** country that exited ussr 's sphere of influence in the 90 's has prospered and they have become better places to live than russia itself ? 
  it 's almost foolish to think ukraine wo n't if russia stops the attempts of destabilization . 
  of course , that will never happen and i would n't stop either if i were russia . 
  it 's about two rational actors with conflicting interests . 
  i already mentioned that sanctions increased/will increase putin 's popularity . 
  do you comprehend how isolated and chauvinistic the media in an authoritarian state ? 
  it truly is alien to everything you 've been exposed , i assure you from experience . 
  there is absolutely no chance the current russian population , with their culture , values , and heck , rational interests , will ever want anything but an assertive autocrat as their leader . 
  ** edit ** : i went through a bit of your history and it seems you are a thorough racist and would n't debate someone from * `` shithole romania '' * either way . 
  it 's a rather lamentable form of intellectual isolation , but i 'm sure you think you 're right . 
  what conflict ? 
  the likelihood of direct engagement between nuclear powers is simply not a realistic scenario . 
  like all russophiles or appeasers , you fail to see that sanctions do work and are a real , effective , non-violent threat . 
  it 's the reason iranians have voted in rouhani and not some jihadist nut , with the results being the ease of sanctions and increased trade . 
  it will surely antagonize the russian population - but who cares ? 
  their interests are opposed to those of the ukrainian people and to eu/nato also , but the second part is not relevant . 
  appeasement of autocrats has only ever lead to the strengthening of their power . 
  and we do n't live in a world of churchills but in one chamberlains , as it appears . 
  * `` it 's because it 's not you who would have to actually fight the war '' ' * i would enlist if it came to that . 
  this needs to be said . 
  even if the tone is choke full of right wing confrontationalism , the facts are indisputable . 
  it 's unbelievable how much the mentality of european citizens fits the stereotypes russians have towards us . 
  i take pride in some of those stereotypes - secularism , gender equality , inclusiveness - but i wish they would n't come packed with weakness , defeatism and subversive thoughts . 
  both the extreme right and left seem to adore the even slight possibility that modern western society might weaken or break down . 
  you see it in the excitement reddit shows over wirld conflicts , the euphoria and drive to exacerbate every american foreign policy failure , the irrational fetishization of `` bric '' policies and the obsession with worst-case scenarios over every action that the west undertakes . 
  i 've only seen strong stances on russian expansionism from baltic states , poland and romania . 
  maybe because people here have lived through soviet domination , before the evolution brought by western liberal capitalism . 
  i do n't think either hippies or racist autocrats in the west give a shit about how much good their countries have brought upon the world , and themselves . 
  their agendas can only be advanced through disorder and subversion . 
  do not let ukraine fall . 
  it 's almost as if being part of the western capitalist economy instead of being a russian satellite is better for everyone except russia . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  inb4 evil bankers , washington , collapse of capitalism , etc, 
  what i usually call bailouts are the `` loans '' with serious disadvantages for the creditor , enacted urgently to avoid insolvency of banks/industries/treasuries . 
  unlike greece , for example , romania and bulgaria took loans from the imf and world bank ( not the ecb ) with serious interest rates . 
  they 've been repaid btw , at least the larger sum to the imf . 
  but loans work and they 've worked with romania and bulgaria , with no bailouts . 
  ** disincentivise the ukrainians from pushing past it ** is anyone thinking ukraine will push into kursk/briansk , are you for real ? 
  if a bullet/splinter/ukrainian fly lands over the border with russia , we wo n't hear the end of it from russian shills . 
  ever . 
  i believe they will be very cautious . 
  and about transnistria , damn , i wish you 're right . 
  first step though : moldavian integration . 
  `` middle-term '' ? 
  why middle term ? 
  shh , just do n't question it . 
  it 's the magic of socialism . 
  just look at how france 's economy is developing !, 
  look at some fucking polls . 
  yes , they are ** that ** brainwashed . 
  it 's a cultural thing . 
  or fuck off . 
  maybe your employer , `` ex '' - kgb mr. vlad should stop with the 19th-century style annexations ? 
  maybe , just maybe the anti-russian sentiment would decrease ? 
  probably russian shill . 
  his whole history is basically purely marxist ( not alabama-hick-town-commies-in-the-whitehouse marxist , proper upstanding communist ) / pro-russian , anti-western democracy crap . 
  move along . 
  `` creating anti-russian sentiment among the general population `` 3 anti-russian sentiment is what we need in order for our leaders to take a proper , robust stand . 
  what exactly is the `` evil '' , even lesser , in this deal ? 
  my fellow romanians , as usual , are unable to grasp the benefits we have already experienced from western integration - strategic military participation and development , security , jobs , a missle defense system making romania practically invulnerable to icmbs , visa rejection from over 50 % to double digits , the establishment of the anti-corruption agency as a requirement to join nato , an imf deal what saved the romanian economy in 2009 ( which has been almost entirely repaid owed to lax terms ) not to mention the improvement of public image etc. 
  we should end this anti-us circlejerk before we get what we want : the retreat of the us from european affairs leaving us completely exposed and defenseless ... does it look like european foreign policy has any might or influence ? 
  this superiority complex of ours is as rampant as americans ( citizens and politicans ) desire to stop becoming involved where they are unwanted . 
  and who can blame them . 
  it 's a very powerful word . 
  it just so happens the phenomenon it represents is becoming more widespread . 
  please share your crystal ball . 
  so are the violent separatists not terrorists ? 
  yes , let 's depend more on the bully ( who actually depends on us ) get the fuck back to rt. 
  china is independent and has far more economic ties to the west than russia ( and more territorial issues with russia ) . 
  your bearhunting judokan chessmaster needs us much more than we need him . 
  annihilating the terrorists would almost certainly not draw in russia directly . 
  they are n't stupid . 
  we just should n't wait for america time and time again to be imposing on our behalf on the world stage, 
  `` my country '' is not the us . 
  never been there . 
  i just see what the us presence here in eastern europe where i live has aided or facillitaed : safety , strategic integration , jobs owed to the military bases ( one new being built ) , the anti-corruption agency established as a requirement to join nato , a lot of trade partnerships that propped my country in a proper capitalist system of world finance , visa rejection rate from 50 % to single digits this year , the imf who rejolted our economy in 2009 and the loan has been repaid fast owed to lax terms . . any eu citizen who implies that we should `` turn our backsides '' to the us is retarded or has no notion of how fundamentally integrated the two entities are ( militarily , in terms of trade and finance ) - hint : much more than we are tied to 5 gas pipelines . 
  i think it shows how retarded the public opinion is and how one can get a lot more shit done by completely ignoring it ( like when putin was unpopular but kept pumping money into the russian military industrial complex ) why wo n't the west ? 
  the great enemy to the eu - the us , whose economy is suffering because they have to maintain dozens of bases on eu territory . 
  because we wo n't get our hands dirty ourselves . 
  how and why exactly are our leaders supposed to `` stand up '' to the us , the international entity that has been standing up for us during this crisis ? 
  you should look up the marshall plan sometimes and get off rt. 
  rt shill detected . 
  fuck off back to daddy vlad . 
  which is retarded , because in the us there 's actual opposition , a democratic system , different entities with different goals and interests , unlike the gazprom-acquired-duma tsardom . 
  you 'd prefer a rt investigation . 
  i feel i do n't know shit even if i study all these institutions daily . 
  since i 'm in law school , my only belief that truly solidified is that the majority of the population ( that applies to the eu and individual states alike ) wo n't ever have a grasp on the machinations of policy making .
