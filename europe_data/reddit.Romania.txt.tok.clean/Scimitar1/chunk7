  1500 years old sectarian divisions , owed to cultural inferiority , are the west 's fault ? 
  tribal disputes that dictate african modern politics are in fact western conspiracies ? 
  maybe they should go to russia , because it 's the only reason assad has remained in power and isis arose as the only formidable force to counteract him . 
  western intervention has made some places more stable , other less so . 
  regardless , these countries ' citizens have their own large share of responsability for their issues . 
  i 'm not even against accepting refugees as we 're doing now ; but they should fuck off with the entitled mentality and accept settlement in hungary and romania too , not only in the north where the welfare is more juicy . 
  your mentality is what will bring ruin to to the greatness of western civilization . 
  i come here daily and i literally recognize no romanian redditor here except the anarchisto guy , because he is mentally unwell , and the atred person because they post a lot on r/romania . 
  edited, 
  better than one up until recently led literally by criminals , amirite ? 
  i find funny this mentality that refugees should be entitled to their host countries ' privileges . 
  no , they should n't . 
  they are only saved from poor economic conditions ( and in rare cases military violence ) out of european magnanimity . 
  we do n't owe them anything . 
  the us is led by isolationists and technologically clueless people , with fascist tendencies at that . 
  why bother investing so much in bullshit surveillance of citizens that is so many kinds of unlawful and immoral when cyber security is actually underfunded ? 
  when signit analysis is underfunded , just like special ops/cia , they funnel money to nsa to basically spy on those who torrent and those who sell weed . 
  and so many resources of foreign surveillance are spent on american allies and corporate espionage - meanwhile defectors leak files to nato 's enemies and a secretary of state uses a personal email account for information of upmost sensivity . 
  intelligence services have forgotten their purpose : a tool of foreign policy not internal power consolidation or corporate profit . 
  always respecting jingoists who do their own dirty work . 
  let 's hope he sees combat . 
  ** only once ** . 
  ( though it 's obviously posing and that 's not gon na happen ), 
  [ concern intensifies ], 
  conflicts in this side of the world have led to more deaths than populations of current unstable countries , and are older than the current unstable countries by hundreds of years . 
  because up until now moldova was a bastion of optimism . 
  in no way will this be a russian win . 
  ukraine is wrestled out of russia 's influence for ever . 
  they gained nothing with crimea that they did n't already have - complete military access and sevastopol port loaned ... as i dont think any western powers had actual interest in crimea being some kind of nato base . 
  aka capitulation . 
  how is security not a good use of money , seeing as european defense spending is going down faster than even our enemies ' increases ? 
  it 's time for europe to own its own military policy and become less dependent on a more and more isolationist us . 
  source ? 
  she is an elected official of a representative democracy , in a political system were lobbying is illegal , unions are strong and corporations do n't need any governmental concessions to make profits . 
  there 's no evil overaching corporate conspiracy that made the arab spring happen , just sectarian conflicts going back 1400 years . 
  spewing this leftist bullshit does n't make it true . 
  til investigated = convicted . 
  although it is free of anything that might constitute a `` war '' in a traditional sense . 
  there are many areas of extreme criminality in the world , even rivaling northern mexico , even leading to more deaths than some actual armed conflicts - which are n't in a state of war . 
  are mexican immigrants considered regufees now ? 
  kek, 
  the gaps are slowly closing though ( with some ** very ** notable exceptions of recession ) . 
  i do n't see why we should n't work towards a form of federalism . 
  yes . 
  there are . 
  or do you mean to move the entire population of syria into europe ? 
  there are some areas affected , some are n't . 
  if you read the article , or statistics on this topic , you would see that a good portion of asylum seekers probably come from safe north african / middle eastern countries , and it 's just a form of ( illegal ) immigration, 
  til sectarian and tribal disputes going back to before any nation state existed ( including america ) are america 's fault . 
  or maybe the arab spring was the most grandiose cia operation ? 
  btw , a comparatively small portion of asylum seekers come from iraq ( which had been a moderately safe state for some years before the rise of isis in 2013 ), 
  is mexico war torn ? 
  fair enough , that sounds sensible . 
  and when i said propaganda , i did n't mean stopfake . 
  because they have a national mindset of unity , despite their differences , despite state rights and unique regional cultures , norms , laws . 
  something very possible in europe too despite the ethno-cultural barriers . . if there was political will . 
  some people will bring me the bullshit argument that the differences are n't so great . 
  in actuality , the economic disparity between us states is insane . 
  mississippi gdp/capita is lower than in most romanian cities but ny is almost triple that . 
  please tell me what major human rights abuses was assad 's government responsible for before 2011 ? 
  regimes change policies . 
  they can be very cozy and liberal during peacetime ( which syria was by middle-eastern standards ) - but the moment , for instance , some sunnis ask for a consitution that would privilege them ; everything descends into bloodshed . 
  hundreds of nations of millions of people have their own self determination and are able to make their own choices ( in this instance , primitive religious warfare ) . 
  not all prefigurations of history are dictated by western will , which is a very stupid way to look at the world . 
  occidental involvement sometimes makes things worse , sometimes it does n't . 
  but those issues do not develop in a vaccum , and ** citizens are responsible for their countries ills most of the time . 
  ** the inherent sectarian nature of the conflict has been recognized by everyone , including the un . 
  how are these `` obviously fake news '' ? 
  not only that every watchgroup , every organization monitoring the conflict except the kremlin have stated the bulk of eastern ukrainian hardware , and maybe even manpower , are russian in origin - the casualities figure is corroborated with both rebel and ukrainian reports . 
  i personally believe the figure is very likely to be inflated , i do n't think the majority of donbass troops are russian , but the way you 're phrasing it makes it sound you genuinely buy the red propaganda that there 's just soldiers on vacation and the war is a completely internal affair . 
  that false viewpoint could not be complete without the eternal false equivalence : ` both western and russian sources are just as ( un ) trustworthy ' - whilst it has been repeatedly proven that the kremlin has lied about near everything in this debacle , and western predictions and reports have been verified . 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halabja_chemical_attack ) also , wmds were found . 
  they were actually the ones sold by the us in the 80s when saddam was best bro with washington . 
  i am not contesting it was a bogus casus belli and a useless war , i 'm just saying the story is much different from how the media portrays it . 
  if you bother to read documents , intelligence reports , wikileaks , etc, 
  again , i have to repeat this , because people do n't comprehend this simple fact . 
  people who bring up this retarded argument should probably do some research . 
  it 's not the us that made assad shoot and gas his own people ( in fact , he was very western-supported before the whole shebang ) . 
  it 's not the nato who determined libya 's complex , centuries-old tribal system that still dictates politics and political conflict - where it reached a point that benghazi would have been craters of artillery if not for the no-fly-zone . 
  these are sectarian and tribal conflicts that go back hundreds of years . 
  they would be different if imperialism had not been , but they would exist . 
  and i am not even against accepting most refugees - it should be our humane reaction to millions of people 's suffering , but it 's not our duty because we owe them something . 
  downvotes , of course . 
  for continental europeans , there are no conflicts that are n't uk/us fault . 
  we 'd be accepting hundreds of thousands of kurd refugees if that had n't happened . 
  if any made it out alive from the chemical weapons .

  source on the last one ? 
  i 've heard it often , but from all public positions of sd officials , they are nothing but progressive when it comes to issues of gender , marriage , adoption . 
  clueless western europeans teaching us about security , yet again . 
  do n't you have any shame ? 
  protected by the blanket of nato security guarantees for half a century , free to develop and progress socio-economically , while the east suffered communist oppression . 
  and now you 're lecturing us about our security ?
