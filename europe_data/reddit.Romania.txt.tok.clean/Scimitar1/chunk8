  kindly fuck off and be grateful your grandparents did n't have to endure russian expansionism . 
  and of course , no such bullshit could be complete without the false equivalence that ` both sides are acting the same ' , which is factually and demonstrably false . 
  so latvia should adjust their constitution in order to accomodate the state-sponsored media channels of their aggressive neighbour . 
  and that is logical , how ? 
  russia is waging a hybrid media war meant to subversively destroy european unity and western institutions , for their strategic gains . 
  there is a difference between anti-government/anti-establishment publications and those of a declared enemy of nato , working to cause unrest . 
  russian officials repeatedly stated they do not believe in the independence of baltic states . 
  what you 're proposing is not idealistic , just clueless . 
   sweden democrats  far right, 
  it 's not about the gold really , as much as it is about the treasures of romanian voivodes . 
  the orthodox church here was very keen on safekeeping such treasures throughout centuries . 
  a very very small part of what has been returned has great historical value and it 's from the [ 4th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietroasele_treasure ) . 
  they also stole a portion of the national archives , volumes of old documents and primary sources , and those also contained the archeological/anthropological analysis of the physical treasures . 
  even though the volume of gold was much much smaller than the spanish gold ( about 120 tonnes ) , the estimated worth of the whole treasure is over half of that of the spanish state , owing to the literally trainloads of old jewels of romanian royalty , manuscripts and art objects . 
  imagine britain had sent off the crown jewels for safekeeping in a state of emergency , to an ally , and then that ally not returning them due to small diplomatic/territorial disagreements . 
  human travel routes as commodity . 
  no need to be dramatic and minimize slavery . 
  * `` they ca n't stay where they are either '' * . of course not . 
  welfare in hungary and romania is not as juicy as further west . 
  protecting our interests . 
  why not , fight fire with fire . 
  if our liberal values are becoming a liability in the face of the enemy , maybe it 's time to adjust them . 
  look over the reasons for the denial , it 's contradicting the latvian constitution . 
  maybe they should change their constitution to accomodate a news network representing the subversive views of their ** aggressive neighbour ** ? 
  nobody cares about your opinion if what you want to do is rip the country you live in from the eu and nato . 
  dissent against these institutions should not be allowed because it 's only subversive in nature . 
  the fight is not for decreasing putin 's popularity , that will never happen in such a brainwashed environment . 
  what the sanctions are meant to do is weaken the russian economy and make it incapable of further adventurous military engagements and power projection . 
  i also see the decrease in oil price as a joint saudi-us strategy ( and an extension of sanctions ) , because it benefits everyone - except american refiners and extractors , and it 's not such a huge part of the american economy , thus they can be thrown under the bus for geopolitical games . 
  the east is outplayed yet again . 
  well , i could link you similar replies from similarly-minded users about the recent transports of hardware to romania . 
  i 'm addressing the mentality . 
  it does n't matter if it pertains to poland , or here , or the baltics . 
  we 've sent troops and hardware in kosovo , afghanistan , iraq - their number bound by our means of course , but we sent . 
  ( unlike some other allies of yours ) . 
  and a war involving poland and romania would not be a foreign war . 
  a large portion of american dominance rests upon the architecture of security guarantees bound by nato . 
  and do n't give me that bernie sanders bullshit about the american economy . 
  the average american is richer than most western europeans by quite a margin . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  supply and demand . 
  romanian television is absolute trash and i have n't had a tv for years . 
  but if that 's what plebs are into , fuck yeah it should n't be regulated . 
  and the chick does n't look abused or coerced or anything . 
  they are soldiers , they 've signed up for it . 
  it 's a job like any other , and a good one , with plenty of benefits . 
  us/nato hegemony is what 's keeping trade routes open and capitalism alive to fill your strip malls with stuff . 
  also , arguably the abrupt decrease in war-related casualties all over the world after 1990 is due to us being the sole superpower . 
  so yes , it is in your interest . 
  soldiers are not meant to be with their families - they are meant to project power and protect national interests . 
  sorry , i expected another clueless western european teaching me and the us about security . 
  what 's your business what america and her allies do ? 
  given the recent upsurge in worldwide unrest , partly due to the us 's weakening intervention , yeah - nato bases are great guarantees of security . 
  anti-americanism . 
  it 's funny how western europe was shielded , by america , from communist repression - yet now they 're the ones educating us about the moral relativism of genocide and oppression . 
  this person is just a russian apologist . 
  it seems like what she/he 's typing is reasonable , but his/her whole comment history , like 90 % is whataboutism about america and excuses made for every enemy of the western world . 
  he 's beyond a relativist retard - a thorough subversive tool . 
   on the contrary . 
  the forces that now rule russia are the ones that brought the soviet union down . 
  ** [ the forces that now rule russia are literally the ex-kgb apparatus ] ( http://20committee.com/2015/01/24/russias-emerging-holy-war/ ) ** they are putin 's natural powerbase , his `` comfort zone '' in western parlance , plus they are the guarantor of his maintaining power as the economic crisis worsens . 
  current reports indicate that putin 's inner circle now is made up entirely of siloviki , to use the russian term , men from the special services : national security council head nikolai patrushev , federal security service ( fsb ) head aleksandr bortnikov , foreign intelligence service ( svr ) head mikhail fradkov , and defense minister sergei shoygu . 
  and of course , if you look at the big picture , they are using the same strategies as before the 90s - destabilization through attacking security and surveillance ( snowden ) , attempting to drive rifts between europe and america to weaken the alliance through useful idiots ( you , far-right parties , far-left parties ) , direct media propaganda with a relativist message that `` nothing is true '' and all international actors are just as bad , so you might as well not oppose russia !, 
  actually i 'm talking about communism itself not the red army . 
  the fact we changed sides from the nazis by overthrowing a fascist regime is a victory . 
  the coup was entirely a romanian internal affair free of any russian involvement , actually - as antonescu was massively unpopular even before he started losing the war . 
  the red army was also civilized in occuppying romania , and it was done free of violence , unlike in the rest of eastern europe . 
  and we fought together for a year . 
  it looked like proper democratic reconstruction might happen . 
  but then they committed complete and utter fraud at the 1948 elections ( because no marxist party in romania ever achieved more than 4-5 % ) , even if the democratic parties with the most popular support were ** ready to cooperate with moscow and pay reparations ** . 
  and then the allies abandoned us . 
  so the rest is history . 
  and instead of slowly building up an industrialized communist state that would be their ally , they insisted for borderline genocidal collectivization and political , cultural and economic repression ( stuff like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sighet_prison ) , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom ) , and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_romania ) ) of a society that had essentially been , in practice and mentality , agrarian capitalist for a century . 
  the only real progress of post-war romania began in the 60 's when we cut these ties with moscow and opted for national communism ... and it was working well ( as well as a collectivized economy can go , still nothing compared to the west , and even yugoslavia ) until old ceasca went complete batshit . 
  for me , and i 'd wager to say for most romanians , the east means only hunger and oppression . 
  and it 's silly to say in the long term that 's not a threat anymore . 
  ** edit ** : looking through this guys ' comments he is one of those people that think eastern european countries should never have joined nato . 
  and he 's literally a chamberlain fanboy . 
  from the bottom of my heart , fuck you . 
  it 's just satisfaction ( at least for me ) . 
  i 'm far from worried . 
  a little bit of historical schadenfreude for what the red scourge has done to us . 
  by saying something beyond retarded , beyond populistic , that no sane head of state in the western world would ever take seriously ? 
  the endless `` peak oil '' , the moronic scare from the 70s that does n't seem to end . 
  there are a lot of environmental reasons to quit reliance on oil , and i hope it happens - but the lack of reserves is not one of them . 
  new deposits are being found at a faster and faster rate . 
  the real crisis of oil will be that of demand , not supply ; and it 's beginning to happen . 
  their problem . 
  why are the world 's issues automatically euroamerican responsabilities ? 
  and even more , when the western world tries to correct them , they are the ones taking all the blame . 
  nobody with a sane mind would ever say modern german policy and public mentality has ** anything ** in common with their past historical sins . 
  i did n't mean to say german armed forces are incompetent or anything ; it 's just a tidy and simplistic portrayal of the issues . 
  i do n't give a fuck what conspiracy theories butthurt serbs come up with . 
  why should they ? 
  it was a big victory for nato and the western world ( and especially croatians ) . 
  why should they show penance or regret at hammering the last nail in the coffin of a genocidal regime ? 
  it 's about time you got rid of the broomsticks . 
  there are only three countries in the world maintaining security , trade routes , air supremacy and arguably world order : the us , britain and france . 
  that 's not nearly enough . 
  iceland has the population of my neighbourhood .
