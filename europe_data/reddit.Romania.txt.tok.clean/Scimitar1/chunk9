  like , from here , from 9 stories , i can see dwellings inhabitted by more people than there are in iceland . 
  there is absolutely no possibility of contagion with a financial sector that small . 
  they could nationalize all banks and skin alive all financiers and it would n't matter . 
  bailouts , as unethical as they may be , do n't happen because of bribes or whatever evil backroom deals populist media comes up with . 
  ** governments just do n't want to see their countries crashing from domino effects of a total banking failure . 
  ** and that 's why we need tougher financial regulation ( which is being implemented , for example in greece , and yet the same people are still whining about it ) it would literally be better to give malta or luxembourg as models for such policies , yet still completely dumb . 
  but countries with globally integrated economies and large volumes of inter-dependent assets ** and liabilities ** do not have that luxury at all . 
  * but it turns out that there is no safe haven for small countries as part of a larger entity . 
  * the only reason iceland is a safe haven of direct democracy and completely sovereign economic policy is specifically that they are a small country . 
  ** iceland is irrelevant , and it can do whatever it wants . 
  ** every single argument this guy gives works against the idea he 's trying to convey . 
  it 's endearing , innit ? 
  just like `` nazi '' , `` men 's rights acti '' , etc. 
  and if you 're a commie , i 'm sorry for you , but that 's super fine and i would be revolted if your comments were to be deleted . 
  outright racism and and encouragement of racist policies though ; , i feel that needs to be culled . 
  mods , i urge you to just ignore her/him . 
  nothing will ever satisfy commies or extremists of any kind . 
  i have never noticed any kind of comments being deleted except gross racism and inflamatory fud that 's meant to cause contention , which is awfully much like trolling . 
  do n't let the sub degenerate into / r/worldnews or / r/politics, 
  good arguments all around . 
  i can see why employing the same practices would be needlessly hawkish . 
  no worries , you still have some of their successors in die linke . 
  no wonder there 's pro-novorossyia demonstrations in germany . 
  why does n't nato violate russian airspace ? 
  it totally makes sense in terms of exercises and power projection . 
  we keep being intimidated with little no reaction , we are allowing the russian hybrid-propaganda war to be waged in western media , with little to no reaction . 
  where is the 80s , when ( at least some ) western leaders were n't spineless corporate drones ? 
  get that asparagus and stick it up your ass . 
  then look up what percentage of romanian immigrants are very skilled professionals , such as medics , engineers and it people . 
  i do n't give a fuck about your neighbour , and you can go fuck yourself with your 80 iq level racism . 
  romania is a net contributor to the eu . 
  seeing as literally every single eastern european state that exited the russian sphere of influence in favor of being integrated with western insitutions . . have now a higher hdi than russia itself . 
  and orders of magnitude of economic progress compared to the state of their economy at the end of soviet slavery . 
  which is why we have to be offensive and fight this hybrid war . 
  putin and the fsb have either planted or collaborated with a large array of far-right and far-left organizations in europe ( fm , die linke , syriza , podemos , and friendly terms with ukip ) meant to slowly destabilize europe . 
  western powers need to be offensive and do the same to russia . 
  if we had real leaders in power , with real vision on long term security , we would be funding chechens heavily . 
  there are of course valid arguments for euroscepticism . 
  although we need to make an effort to distinguish subversive hybrid war from manifestations of democracy . 
  nope . 
  you can go fuck yoursef with your retarded assumptions . 
  i 'm not some noua dreapta / prm brainless drone . 
  there is no `` propaganda '' about the romanian-ness of moldova . 
  we are the same ethno-linguistic demographic . 
  [ maybe you should read up on russian efforts of creating an artificial moldovan identity , which actually seems to have worked . ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) . 
  very similar to the homogenity imposed by romanian communists onto the multicultural transylvania . 
  there is also the fact there 's millions of romanians outside our border living in an country , with borders drawn artificially to be a russian buffer state , in poverty orders of magnitude higher than what you find in ro . 
  although nobody is starving in moldova , it 's very much ruthless to think that they do n't deserve european and nato integration , seeing as every eastern european state benefited from these things to great extent . 
  for shitty self-flagellating leftists , there 's no such thing as national pride , no matter how rational it is to have it . 
  i doubt moldovans would have any problem giving autonomy/independence to transnistria or gagauzia , and same goes for romanians . 
  the problem is , as always , russian salami tactics . 
  if you cede an inch of land , there will always be another village , and another , and another which suddenly identify as russian speakers being oppressed . 
  and then they go on vacation on the rest of your country ... 
  kek, 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
  it 's pretty 50/50 in moldova though . 
  70 years of russian propaganda does that . 
  really ? 
  i rest my case then . 
  what happens if there 's a domino reaction ? 
  maersk does n't like unions either , neither does statoil dk or arla foods . 
  if there is a real movement from the free market to curtail abusive collective agreement , it could get ugly . 
  you built up some sympathy until i heard about the fsb propaganda that karamanlis was to be assassinated . 
  since the bay of pigs , the us has n't tried to assassinate any head of state ( except for ghadaffi , and that was a wildly different scenario ) . 
  even if they did , such an operation would never be leaked to the fsb no matter how many snowdens defect to moscow . 
  she is , by executive order . 
  i 'm tired of hearing that `` merkel could n't have done anything '' . 
  ** merkel should n't have done anything ** because nobody should get special treatment . 
  you do not understand how stimulants work . 
  you are part of the problem that is the ever expanding nanny state . 
  fuck off with that shit . 
  these people do n't understand how jurisdiction and legal sovereignity works . 
  who gives a shit what a retired general with leftist sensibilities thinks of the drone program ? 
  it 's an oft repeated lie that they `` create more terrorists '' - it 's something that is impossible to be quantified . 
  what drones do though , is annihilate command structures , like in northern pakistan and afghanistan , virtually eliminating al-qaeda , one leader at a time . 
  also , at much lower civillian casualties than conventional military operations , lower cost , and more precision leading to less civillian death . 
  there 's so much bullshit in that comment section , it 's amazing . 
  these people do not realize that drones are piloted by humans , and they also do n't realize how target aquisition works - enemy combatants in combat zones have guns , and they need to be taken out . 
  good . 
  * `` ronald reagan - number one enemy of the tutrakan village establishment !, 
  '' * ** now you done fucked up , ronnie . 
  somehow , he 's mainly downvoted for hating commies ? 
  an ideology that in applicability , brought about similar human casualties as nazism ? 
  i would n't say they are as bad as neo-nazis , because racism is inherently more discriminatory than classism , but still . 
  ** traditions are fine when they do n't interfere with human rights , but when they do , it is my view that they need to be purged and destroyed . 
  ** absolutely well said . 
  but it means something different than the agenda you 're pushing for . 
  what is the likelihood all of those people are fleeing actual warfare ? 
  they look to be from wildly different ethnic backgrounds , and many look sub-saharan african . 
  i simply doubt these are all libyans and syrians , and iraqis . 
  why did n't we have a similar refugee crisis in 2002-2004 ? 
  and it 's a highly documented fact a large majority of those refugees do not meet the criteria for seeking asylum . 
  we just do not have the legal possibility of rejecting them , which is an error that needs to be fixed before inevitable disorder and disaster . 
  because , now , in the age of internet , they learned where the easy life is . 
  i am for a multi-cultural society , that 's pan-european , united and peaceful . 
  but that can only happen within the framework of western legality . 
  ** of secularism , basic human rights , gender equality and rule of law ** . 
  there can be an europe that 's 90 % african and muslim for all i care - they are just as capable of following proper education and professional careers as any western european . 
  if they adapt to our laws . 
  there is no room for enclaves where young extremist males can oppress and harass everyone around them ; jews , women and host country citizens .
