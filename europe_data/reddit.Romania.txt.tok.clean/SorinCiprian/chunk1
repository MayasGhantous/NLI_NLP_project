i would be against it . 
  however , i would be for helping ukraine with weapons and supplies . 
  no bears on a leash though . 
  i was a bit confused at first by the first picture until i saw the country name . 
  the cake does n't represent your actual birthday . 
  it means that today it has been x amount of years ( 2 , in your case ) since you created your account . 
  happy cake day , dude !, 
   btw ... 
  i 'm still waiting on those weekly news posts ... 
  `` fastest internet in the world '' ... yeah right ... 
  just to put things in perspective - moldova 's nominal gdp is 5.5 times smaller than bucharest 's gdp ( the capital of romania ) with a population double that of bucharest . 
  damn . 
  that castle is incredible . 
  it looks like it came straight out of a fantasy story . 
  i actually pondered when i made my comment what to choose - the budapest parliament or this castle . 
  i chose the parliament just because i 've been there myself . 
  i hope one day i 'll get to see that castle as well . 
  is it open to the public ? 
  [ peles castle ] ( http://www.tropikal.ro/wp-content/uploads/wppa/1169.jpg ) is my favorite building in the entire world . 
  it 's the most beautiful and tasteful thing i 've ever seen in my entire life ( i 'm talking about the interior ) . 
  it used to be the royal family 's summer residence , but nowadays king michael opened it to the public . 
  the favorite building from another european nation would have to be the [ hungarian parliament building ] ( http://th02.deviantart.net/fs70/pre/i/2013/279/6/d/parliament_building___budapest_by_pingallery-d6pezb9.jpg ), 
  [ subcarpati - balada romanului ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xu1tkect4i ) [ phoenix - in umbra marelui urss ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adro9oumolc ) < < in the shadow of the great bear ( ussr )  , 
  i use chrome ... 
  off-topic question - is this site tucked to the side for everyone or is it just for me ? 
  how do i fix it ? 
  i always thought that [ king carol i ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2014/08/21/53f588070d133766a872e5c4/646x404.jpg ) would be able to kick some ass . 
  just look at this [ bad-ass dapper dude ] ( http://www.worldwideromania.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/carol_i_of_romania_king.jpg ) . 
  [ michael the brave ] ( http://www.istorie-pe-scurt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mihai-viteazul-anii-de-domnie-1593-1601-.jpg ) also looks like he 'd be able to crack some skulls . 
  fuck , mate !, 
  came here to say exactly that . 
  i like him better now . 
  in the last 2 years there have been thousands of convictions on corruption charges - from small-town cops to really big fish like ministers or billionaires - they 're all getting fucked . 
  things are getting noticeably better . 
  well , we 're in 5th place in the world at pure alcohol consumption per capita . 
  the czech republic is in a shameful 9th place . 
  so you clearly do belong here . 
  there might be a lot of people here that do n't drink , but those of us who do , do n't fuck around . 
  rumania , fuck yea !, 
  on a serious note , i was n't aware that they 're so well equipped . 
  i guess it 's because of that huge scandal some time ago . 
  basically , the romanian border guards were investigated under the suspicion of corruption and the investigation revealed that they were corrupted big time . 
  so the government 's solution was to get rid of everyone . 
  it apparently worked . 
  this was fantastic . 
  however , i ca n't help but feel like they 're wasting their money on youtube videos with 10 to 20k views . 
  i do n't always see eye to eye with cameron , but i have to agree with him on this one . 
  sure , britain 's economy has been performing well while germany 's and france 's have been slacking . 
  it 's only common sense to take a little bit of pressure off the troubled economies , but not so sudden and certainly not such a huge amount . 
  i 'd also be pissed if my country had to pay 1.65 billion pounds more all of a sudden . 
  shhht !, 
  if they all come to cluj , krajcz\u00e1r pub will be always full and i really like that place . 
   do romanians seriously think we are gypsies ? 
  nope . 
  romanians are aware that the demographic situation in bulgaria is very similar with the one in romania . 
  given the fact that some people only heard of romania because of dracula , i 'd say vampires . 
  it seems that google translate did a pretty good job . 
  thank you for your elaborate answer . 
  i wish you and your husband the best of luck !, 
  also , do n't hesitate to pm me if you ever find yourselves in cluj . 
  if i 'm around , beer/tea/coffee is on me . 
  can you speak romanian or do you use english in your day-to-day life ? 
  if so , can you get by with ease using only english ? 
  i always wanted to meet an aromanian . 
  is there any chance you 'd show up , dude ? 
  or romania and have both the second biggest economic growth and the second biggest co2 emissions reduction in europe in 2013 . 
  ^ yep , ^ i 'm ^ bragging . 
  ^ please ^ do n't ^ judge ^ me . 
  ^ it 's ^ not ^ often ^ that ^ i ^ get ^ to ^ brag ^ about ^ my ^ country . 
  i do n't know him , his music or how stockholmers behave . 
  i pasted the song because it popped into my head and i have n't listened to it in years . 
  you have to agree that it 's a cool song though . 
  not quite , it 's more a case of we were so backwards that upgrading some old facilities did a ton of good for the environment . 
  and also there 's a strong green dive in the country . 
  we like our blue skies and do n't want smog . 
  hydro yes , wind not so much . 
  i 've seen a map of wind energy potential in europe and romania did n't have much wind potential compared to other countries . 
  not even close . 
  this map shows the change in co2 emissions from 2012 to 2013 . 
  in romania 's case , in 2013 , the economy grew by 3.5 % , the industry grew by about 10 % and car ownership grew as well . 
  it 's simply a case of upgrading old ( heavy polluting ) industry to newer one and of heavy investment in green energy production . 
  yep . 
  i was n't born a smoker and as i already said , i have quit for an extended period of time and i can tell you that just a cup of tea by itself on the balcony is n't the same thing . 
  i might just be different . 
  even though i realize it 's fucking stupid and smelly and disgusting , i really love smoking . 
  i did n't start smoking like most people did - caving in from peer pressure to be `` cool '' . 
  i just tried it on my own because i was curious and i liked it from the first time . 
  also , i do n't consider myself to be an addict . 
  i can go without smoking for extended periods of time . 
  it 's uncomfortable , but i 'm certainly not a tobacco slave like most smokers are . 
  to answer your question , yes , i 'd rather have that feeling without a cigarette , but unfortunately i do n't have it . 
  edit : that being said , i strongly do not recommend it . 
  it 's indeed pleasurable as i said , but it 's also bad for you and if you 'll never try it , you 'll never come to like it and that means you 'll never fuck up your lungs . 
   the couple , together for 10 years , got into trouble when mothers expressed outrage that children had to witness their mating . 
  the thing i hate the most is stupid fucking `` concerned '' parents with their stupid fucking kids which get offended over fucking everything . 
  god !, 
  the audacity of those donkeys to do a totally natural thing !, 
  educate your kids you instead of dumbing them down you fucking retards !, 
   it still smells terrible , even the `` flavored '' variants . 
  it smells it only if you inhale the vapor .
