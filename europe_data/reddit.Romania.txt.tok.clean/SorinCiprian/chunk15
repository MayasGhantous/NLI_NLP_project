  the calculated geographical midpoint of europe is actually in [ belarus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe#mediaviewer/file:extreme_points_of_europe.png ) . 
  so the czech republic , germany , poland are actually more in the west than in the east . 
  the center axis passes trough belarus , finland , ukraine , moldova , romania and maybe bulgaria , although i 'm not sure it quite reaches . 
  even though romanians learn in school that geographically we are in central europe , i accepted the term `` eastern european '' because there are lots of westerners like you who refuse to accept us in the `` cool club '' and also because i do n't really care all that much . 
  since 2008 romania keeps dropping in rank . 
  even italy is ahead of us this year . 
  i 've decided i do n't like this peace index anymore . 
  yes , you are right , you guys have a good shot at integrating them . 
  it 's more difficult here because there is reticence on both sides . 
  gypsies are a more isolated here and they do n't let romanians enter their communities ( in a spiritual sense , not physically , even though you can get a good beating if you walk trough a gypsy neighborhood ) and they live a kind of `` fuck the system '' life where they steal , beg etc. 
  ( things that are not considered moral in our society ) this is all because of good ol' romanian racism . 
  the problem is that this is not a new thing . 
  it 's been like this for 200 years , so it will be difficult to change it . 
  true , indeed . 
  i have n't said that the ottoman empire was n't great . 
  it became an empire because of their tenacity ( and numbers ) and that 's all on them . 
  however , this guy had nothing to do with it and is just linking some random battles . 
  i was showing him that all of us can do that . 
  agreed , but then again , when your salary is 200 euros you do n't have time to engage in social programs to integrate minorities . 
  you have bigger problems on your head . 
  at any rate , things are getting a little bit better nowadays . 
  i think he meant to say eu , not schengen . 
  the thing is , there are less beggars on romanian streets than you 'd imagine . 
  the reason you see so many on your streets is because , as you just said , you guys in sweden did n't use to have so many poor people on the streets , so you 're not used to them . 
  as a result , you are probably more likely to feel sorry for them and to give them some cash , so more people took up begging . 
  it was the same in '90s romania . 
  there were lots of gypsies on the streets , but that gradually stopped working for them and now , with the eu being a thing , they see new opportunities . 
  do n't worry , i 'm sure it will pass in 10-15 years . 
  not really . 
   utterly incompetent in doing anything about ? 
  http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02946/roma-teenager_2946582b.jpg i have to admit , you 're doing a really great job yourselves so far .

  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_night_attack ) see ? 
  anyone can come up with a few crushing victories , but in your case it 's even more shameful as you had an empire and we had 3 little countries that were always kept separated . 
   yes , it 's true . 
  it would have been very hard to catch up to italy by 2020 , however , i still think it would have been quite likely . 
  there . 
  better ? 
  romania was booming in the pre-2009 period and there was no reason to believe that a global economic crisis would happen . 
  yes , i understand what you are saying . 
  the growth rates get smaller as the country gets richer and also , the prices would rise . 
  my point was that romania had one of the fastest growing economies in the world . 
  certainly one of the fastest growing relatively developed economies of the world . 
  therefore , i can see why some people thought that it would catch up to it 's western neighbors quite quickly at the time . 
  and it 's true , it would have . 
  maybe not exactly in 2020 , maybe it would have been in 2025 or something like that . 
  the point is , a presumption like that was n't very far-fetched back then . 
  nowadays , it would be impossible , of course , but not back then . 
  yes , it 's true . 
  it would have been very hard to catch up to italy by 2020 , however , i still do n't think it would have been impossible . 
  they are not impossible assumptions . 
  there are 12 years from 2008 to 2020 . 
  now couple that with 7-8 % growth and increasing at the time and you 'll find that these are not overly simplistic assumptions . 
  also , i 'm not making these thing up on my own . 
  that 's what economists predicted before the crisis . 
  yes , nominal . 
  i guess i should have specified that i was referring to the one adjusted at the purchasing power parity ( ppp ) . 
  [ world bank data . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gnp.pcap.pp.cd?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc ) romania - $ 17,650 italy - $ 34,700, 
   it 's not factually true from many points of view and communism itslef is a falimentary system please note that i said `` ok '' , not `` great '' and i also said `` at first '' , meaning strictly in the beginning , not overall . 
   it was meant to lose and i claim it it 's a good thing it did . 
  again , i think you do n't really understand what happened . 
  yes , indeed , capitalism is great and privatization was essential , but unfortunately , it was all done in an laughable manner . 
  the great recession of the 90s ' was a byproduct of that corrupt privatization process . 
   btw , that thing with surpassing italy is bs , italy is a member of g7 , third economy in eu , i do n't know by what measures it would have surpassed it . 
  well , if it 's bs , it 's sure bs that economists really liked to talk about before the crisis . 
  the g7 includes the 7 biggest economies overall . 
  china is the 2nd most important g7 country , yet it 's much-much poorer than luxembourg , even though luxembourg will never be part of the g7 . 
  to put it simply , i was talking about gdp per capita , not total gdp . 
  romania would have surpassed italy in gdp per capita by 2020 if the crisis had n't happened . 
  no , we were not . 
  however , the gap between us and western europe was much smaller back then ( at least in romania 's case ) . 
  yes , that 's very true . 
  unfortunately , you are being downvoted because your arguments are above some people 's levels of comprehension . 
   ceau\u015fescu 's political independence from the soviet union and his protest against the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 drew the interest of western powers , who briefly believed he was an anti-soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the warsaw pact by funding him . 
  ceau\u015fescu did not realise that the funding was not always favorable . 
  ceau\u015fescu was able to borrow heavily ( more than $ 13 billion ) from the west to finance economic development programs , but these loans ultimately devastated the country 's finances . 
  in an attempt to correct this , ceau\u015fescu decided to repay romania 's foreign debts . 
  he organised a referendum and managed to change the constitution , adding a clause that barred romania from taking foreign loans in the future . 
  the referendum yielded a nearly unanimous `` yes '' vote . 
  in the 1980s , ceau\u015fescu ordered the export of much of the country 's agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts . 
  the resulting domestic shortages made the everyday life of romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating , gas and electricity black-outs became the rule . 
  during the 1980s , there was a steady decrease in the living standard , especially the availability and quality of food and general goods in stores . 
  the official explanation was that the country was paying its debts and people accepted the suffering , believing it to be for a short time only and for the ultimate good . 
  the debt was fully paid in summer 1989 , shortly before ceau\u015fescu was overthrown , but heavy exports continued until the revolution in december . 
  i 'm quite tired to hear about `` ceausescu paid all of romania 's debt '' . 
  he did n't . 
  the romanians paid ceausescu 's debts with their own sweat and tears and not the other way around . 
  ceausescu was an idiot which did n't have a single clue about what he was doing . 
   the average person living in romania today is economically worse off than their parents living in romania in 1980 were !, 
  that was quite true up until 2002 , nowadays , not so much . 
  believe me , we are much better off nowadays . 
  not many people know this , but from an economic standpoint , romania ranked much higher in the interwar period than it does today . 
  to put it simply , the difference between western europe and romania today is much larger than it was back then . 
  so , why have n't we kept up with our neighbors ? 
  well , it 's quite simple . 
  many people are aware of the effects of ww2 on different european nations , but most do n't know that romania was utterly destroyed . 
  we had more casualties than great britain , italy , france or the united states .
