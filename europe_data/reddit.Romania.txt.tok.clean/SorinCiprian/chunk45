  what 's your opinion on the matter ? 
  do you think it could be achieved any other way ? 
  ps : this is just a hypothetical discussion . 
  an exercise of imagination , if you will . 
  obviously , i do n't wish to go to war .

   i can confirm that they are in romania . 
  south \u2260 romania . 
  mate . 
   freedom of movement is not unlimited erm ... it actually kinda is . . ? 
  never in my life have i had any of that happen to me , and god knows i took my fair share of taxis . 
  you got ta get out of bucharest , mate . 
  chill . 
  looks very impressive . 
  tallest in europe . 
  erm ... what ? 
  how did you reach this conclusion ? 
  do n't assume that people on average ( especially outside of the eu ) know what countries exactly are in the eu . 
  on the other hand , germany is probably the best known one . 
  i 'm up . 
  less dates to keep in mind . 
  historical reason which are ? 
   our economic situation has nothing to do with us being balkan or not of course it doesnt . 
  however , you know what does ? 
  your geographic situation . 
   we do n't consider ourselves balkanic , so there 's no reason for you to try to put us there again , this is simply stupid . 
  you are balkanic because you are positioned in the balkans . 
  that 's what it fucking means . 
  and not only that , culturally and genetically as well . 
  you are balkanic through and through . 
  if greece was like . . say , belgium - then yea , i would understand . 
  look down on the balkans ? 
  do n't belong in the balkans ? 
  why ? 
  it 's not like greece is a oasis of prosperity surrounded by the filth of the balkans . 
  sorry to disappoint you , but greece fits right in . 
  that 's okay , bud . 
  at least bulgaria is worse . 
  get off your high horse already ? 
   has fallen it was always shit , my friend . 
  higgins looks like he was born to be the president of ireland . 
  i actually like him a lot . 
  i am definitely pro-eu , but i also hate circle-jerking . 
  can confirm for austria . 
  my gf is austrian . 
  : / edit : bloody hell !, 
  it 's my cake day !, 
  i actually think it 's much easier ( and more comfortable for ukrainians ) to find a decent job in poland nowadays . 
  pls save teh continent mister britain . 
  not even close to comparable . 
  this seems like such an american type of endeavour ... 
  i see that the usa 's plan to fuck relations up with everybody is going nicely . 
  nonono ... vlad the impaler made an entire forest of dead ottomans up on poles . 
  stephen the great had 42 battles with the ottoman empire and won 37 of them . 
  michael the brave fought sometimes 10 to 1 against the turks and still won the battles . 
  and there were some others as well . 
  now ... overall , the turks still raped our little asses , ofc . 
  :3 but so did yours . 
  i call fake news on that . 
  according to alternative facts , 28 is higher than 32 . 
  not really . 
  i understand those perfectly . 
  just that the jokes themselves were n't extremely funny to me . 
  maybe it 's just me . 
  ^ ^ edit : happy cake day , btw !, 
  : * edit2 : actually the `` inside joke '' about the bosnians was really funny ( especially coupled with the images ) . 
  yea , it definitely was . 
  i think i did n't word it as i should have . 
  it made me chuckle , but i liked the others more ( except for the belgian one ) . 
  i really like the `` croatia third '' spin on it . 
  otherwise , ~ ~ the least funny one so far , ~ ~ imo . 
  edit : watched the belgium one now ( the only one i missed ) . 
  that was way shittier . 
  sounds like top-tier lore , imo . 
  i support it . 
  i want the credit for it , though . 
  thank you . 
  i , for one , will definitely return the favor , should the need arise . 
  indeed !, 
  sibians ( ? ), 
  are fucking champs !, 
   fun fact : southern romania gets about as much sun as most of italy . 
  well , southern romania gets about as much sun as northern italy , it seems . 
  but still , judging by your map , my point stands . 
  skin tone can not be the only reason . 
  ca n't be the only reason . 
  i 've been to both italy and spain and on average , they are definitely a darker tone than romanians . 
  now it 's also true that i live in transylvania , which is more to the north and in the south the skin tone is a bit darker . 
  however , that does n't explain moldova or ukraine . 
  have you ever seen ukrainians ? 
  pale as fuck . 
  all of them that i 've ever met . 
   romance languages powa or cousins are starting to accept us . 
  definitely . 
  we should give those poor folks a hand . 
  erm . . wtf ? 
  ah , cool . 
  ^ ^ but yea , i do n't really think any of us see being called a balkan country as a bad thing . 
  personally , i do n't consider myself balkan , but i do n't mind it either .
