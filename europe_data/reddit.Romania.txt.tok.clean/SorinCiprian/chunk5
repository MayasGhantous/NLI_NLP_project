  is there a real rivality between the czech republic and poland or are you just going with the trend ? 
  if so , i 'll try as well . 
  take that ... macedonia !, 
  just thinking about how many generations of inventors , scientists , engineers , medics , nobles and rulers have walked on the steps of those universities gives me shivers . 
  a little bit of history on alexandru ioan cuza university for those interested : originally , it was called `` academia vasilian\u0103 '' - vasilian academy ( sometimes known as vasilian college ) . 
  it was founded in 1634 by ruler vasile lupu . 
  later on ( in 1707 ) it changed to '' academia domneasc\u0103 din ia\u0219i '' - princely ( ? ), 
  academy of iasi - and it stayed that way until 1821 . 
  then it became `` gimnaziul vasilian '' - vasilian gymnasium - until 1834 . 
  on the 20th of march 1834 it was changed to `` academia mih\u0103ilean\u0103 '' and it remained so until 1860 when alexandru ioan cuza university was born . 
  live in romania , visit moldova and avoid bulgaria . 
  i see . 
  his comment - `` i hope you are trolling . '', 
  - threw me off . 
  wait . 
  when i submit the countries should i post them in live/visit/avoid order ? 
  live : vatican city ( i 'm an atheist , but gdp per capita is $ 430.000 :d ) visit : latvia avoid : kosovo, 
  live : germany visit : france avoid : uk, 
  tough one . 
  live : switzerland visit : austria avoid : liechtenstein ... i guess . . 
  this subreddit is called r/europe and those posts were exclusively about europe , so i fail to see your logic . 
  not to mention that those type of post were generally received quite well . 
  they had a lot of upvotes and people were commenting like crazy . 
  i prefer those than the usual `` ukrainian conflict '' with 1 or 2 comments and 3 downvotes each . 
   being the flag of two separate organisations you said it yourself . 
  it is the flag on the european commission as well . 
  what else should we put there ? 
  the flag of ethiopia ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i 'd buy one just for a good laugh . 
  i think it 's italy . 
  please do n't be gypsies in a carriage , please do n't be gypsies in a carriage , please ...

  sorry mate , we have dacias . 
  you must come tot terms with the idea . 
  gorgeous stuff , mate . 
  umm . . if i become as rich as say . . bill gates , would i be able to buy neuschwanstein castle ? 
  because that is one of the most beautiful buildings i 've ever seen . 
   it cant be pleasant to sleep there . 
  you 'd be surprised how pleasant it actually is . 
  we have one in romania as well .

  those views are breathtaking . 
  colorado is gorgeous . 
  omg !, 
  that 's gorgeous !, 
  i forgot how beautiful france is . 
  you think . . ? 
  that stuff is incredible !, 
  it 's become a victim of it 's own success . 
  quite sad , really . 
  however , all is not lost for romanian motorists looking for some fun .

  this is the road ceausescu wanted to surpass when he built the transfagarasan . 
  in my opinion , he failed to do so .

  10k per year is not much , indeed . 
  however you could also add romania and bulgaria to that list , probably . 
  10000 dollars a year translates to about $ 830 per month . 
  in romania , he could rent a nice , small , one-room apartment for about 150 dollars per month . 
  the bills would cost him $ 150 and food . . 
  i 'd say about $ 200 . 
  in total , that 's 500 dollars per month and he still has $ 330 to spare on whatever he pleases ( bearing in mind that prices here are very low ) . 
  in bucharest it might be a bit more expensive , but not by much . 
  it 's also quite easy to get by if you speak english , however , it might prove difficult to find a job if you do n't know romanian , though definitely not impossible . 
  he edited the album . 
  it was a picture of a porsche cayenne before he changed it for an opel . 
  yep , i saw . 
  that 's the beautiful 159 , not a 156 . :d, 
  what 's the point in changing the picture from a seat to a jaguar ? 
  they 're both unrepresentative of our police force . 
  vanity is not a good thing , mate . 
  is this a new one or one of the old ones ? 
  sorry , but most pictures here are inaccurate . 
  i seriously doubt that austrian police mostly uses porsche 911s or that the bulgarian police uses mostly cayennes . 
  every police force in the world has a few supercars and suvs in their garage for high speed or off-road chases . 
  however , those are not representative of the police forces . 
  sorry , i do n't want to offend you , but you should have done some research before making this thread . 
  for example , probably 95 % of romanian police cars are dacias . 
  i 've never even seen a seat police car here . 
  maybe he will , maybe he wont . 
  however , what 's your point exactly ? 
  `` oh , well we 've been trough hardships ourselves at some point in time , so our negative actions should be shielded . 
  we are the true victims ! '', 
  guess what ? 
  all countries in the world have been trough hardships at some point . 
  however , pointing fingers and deflecting blows never solves anything . 
  how do you think the germans would have been treated if they denied the holocaust because ethnic germans were heavily persecuted after the war ? 
  not very good , let me tell you that . 
  luckily , they took the blame and they won the world 's respect back . 
  something that turks , ex-yugoslavs , hungarians , russians , americans , romanians , israelis , and many-many other nationalities simply refuse to do . 
  do you want to see change ? 
  do you want the world to respect and acknowledge what was done to your people ? 
  then put your head down and acknowledge what you 've done to others .
