  we love you !, 
  you guys love us back !, 
  ^ right ? 
  favorite - moldova , obviously . 
  least favorite - officially , out of all our neighbors the worst diplomatic relations are with ukraine . 
  they probably improved now that the country is looking west instead of east . 
  unofficially , but clear winner by popular choice would be hungary . 
  us should n't have invaded iraq in the first place . 
  it was such a stupid thing to do . 
  200.000 dead and for what ? 
  even fucking bill o'reilly acknowledged that america should have stayed out of iraq . 
  i 'm not in any way shape or form an antena 3 fan . 
  it 's the worst news channel in romania . 
  however , you clearly have n't watched fox news . 
  those guys are fucking retards . 
  have you seen some of the bullshit and propaganda they broadcast ? 
  it puts antena 3 to shame . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2czbwn/most_visited_tourist_attractions_in_europe/cjkkww3?context=3 i know !, 
  however , tripadvisor is wrong . 
  i just listed the actual most visited tourist attractions in romania . 
  i was n't correcting op , i was correcting tripadvisor . 
  it is . 
  have you visited it ? 
  if not , i really recommend it . 
  it 's worth coming to romania just to see it . 
  you should see the interior . 
  it 's the most refined thing i 've ever seen . 
  it was the summer residence of the royal family . 
  nowadays , the state has given it back to king michael , however , he 's not using it . 
  he opened it to the public . 
  i was referring to the interior as well . 
  i too have visited quite a lot of places ( not nearly as many as you have ) and i 've never ever seen anything that looks better . 
  every inch of that building is designed/built/sculpted / painted by some great master . 
  i understood , i saw the title . 
  i was just pointing it out . 
  it 's still not right . 
  what 's up with you and all these gifs lately ? 
  for romania , it 's not right . 
  these are the most visited tourist attractions in the country in order : 1 ) [ bran castle ] ( http://www.centruldepelerinaj.ro/sites/default/files/imagini/pelerinaje/2013/09/castelul_bran2.jpg ) 2 ) [ brukenthal museum ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/brukenthalpalais_hermannstadt.jpg ) 3 ) [ peles castle ] ( http://www.opiniatimisoarei.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/castelul-peles.jpg ) ( which is the most beautiful thing i 've ever visited in my entire life ) the palace of parliament is quite important , indeed . 
  however , i do n't think it 's even in the top 10 . 
  why is it circlejerk ? 
  i actually greatly enjoy these series . 
  it 's interesting . 
  the little white one is very cute . 
  aw , man !, 
  timisoara is always the best city . . 
  and [ cluj ] ( http://transphoto.ru/photo/05/08/35/508350.jpg ) is just as cool as ... [ sofia ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fgwgx#17 ) . . 
  that 's quite cool . 
  where is that , in bucharest ? 
  you 're still searching ? 
  it 's been more than an hour . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  is it innovative in some way ? 
  or was it given as a negative example . . ? 
  i remember reading somewhere ( and i 'm not sure if i remember right ) that a floating city like that would cost about 3 or 4 trillion dollars . 
  jokes aside , that 's certainly not a coincidence . 
  does anyone have any details ? 
  that would actually be interesting . 
   bucuresti weirdly , i actually greatly appreciated that you called it by it 's romanian name and not the english one . 
   on topic : to be honest , i do n't know . 
  there might be . 
  the building is n't yet finished . 
  it was indeed . 
  3 billion euros . 
  what a waste . 
  not to mention the demolition of ~ ~ dozens ( maybe even hundreds ) ~ ~ of old buildings in that area . 
  an entire neighborhood was raised in order to make way for this ugly thing and the long boulevard that leads to it . 
  edit : i looked it up . 
  it seems that 7000 homes plus 26 churches and some other buildings were demolished because of it . 
  i know , right ? 
  do you wan na trade ? 
  i 'll give you our ~ ~ concrete square ~ ~ [ parliament ] ( http://felixromania.com/wp-content/flgallery/images/wq8rkwys.jpg ) for it . 
  he is a rich dude , however , i doubt he could even afford it . 
  he has a net worth of $ 100 million . 
  that 's a lot , but it does n't seem like enough . 
  also , i agree , the hungarian parliament building is freaking gorgeous . 
  you should see it at night - it 's stunning . 
  damn you !, 
  i wanted to comment the same way . 
  well , at least i agree with your assessment . 
   one `` special '' lion . 
  hahahahaha !, 
  it 's 270 meters long , 245 meters wide , it 's 86 meters tall and 92 meters deep . 
  it has 18 floors - 9 above the ground and 9 below . 
  plus , a lot of underground tunnels . 
  the total surface area is 330.000 m ^ 2 . 
  you might not realize how big it is , but let me put it this way - you 've never ever seen such a big building , not even one close to it 's size ( unless you 've seen the pentagon ) . 
  it also hold 3 world records - the most expensive administrative building in the world , the biggest administrative building in the world and the heaviest building in the world . 
  it 's a fucking monstrosity . 
  well , it houses the chamber of deputies , the senate , the legislative council , the competition council , the national museum of contemporary art , the museum and park of totalitarianism and socialist realism and the headquarters of the southeast european cooperative initiative . 
  plus , there are dozens of other huge conference rooms and things like that , which are used for a wide variety of other purposes . 
  i 'm not sure if this is filling the building or not seeing how huge it is , but it looks like it might . 
  romania did n't invest in the internet . 
  private corporations took it upon themselves to modernize the infrastructure . 
  and yes , the government is focusing on developing remote rural areas . 
  however , that is very expensive and very hard . 
  romania is almost 5 times the size of denmark and 45 % of the population lives in villages . 
  that means developing infrastructure for lots of communities that have 1-2000 inhabitants each which are very remote and very far apart from each other . 
  couple that with the economic disaster that was communism ( 40 years of it , no less ) , we are lagging behind in development .
