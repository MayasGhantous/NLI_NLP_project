  do n't think they 'll give up the region without a fight . 
  that region is vital as it might hold the key for europe 's energy independence from russia . 
  in my opinion , the fact that azerbaijan and armenia are at it again is not a coincidence . 
  russia kept that area in a frozen conflict since '92 playing both nations against each other . 
  now , with armenia clearly being on russia 's side and with azerbaijan 's plans to export gas in europe ( maybe joined by iran and turkmenistan in the future ) , russia is finally letting this conflict play out . 
  the kremlin can not keep this going anymore as the sides are clearly defined now . 
  also , if armenia wo n't get any help from russia ( which they probably will ) , they will be in deep shit . 
  azerbaijan is much stronger . 
  hey , / u/dngrs !, 
  where 's the romanian news ? 
  you are usually the guy providing my weekly news read . 
   russia , we are getting ready for a big war shit . 
  so ... should i start working out ? 
  at the moment , i 'm not sure how far i can run with 40kg of equipment on my back . 
  oh my god . 
  bosnia ... what happened there ? 
   on the other hand the question is what will they do after independence ? 
  another balkan state or uniting with serbia ? 
  that 's actually a very good question . 
  like you , i do n't have much of an opinion on this . 
  however , i fear that if srpska gets it 's independence , the people that will gain positions of power will most likely like to hold them . 
  while belgrade would probably want to be the central authority ( if the two would unite ) . 
  this would lead to more tension and disputes in an already unstable region . 
  plus , let 's not forget - new countries are very messy . 
  there would be a need for new infrastructure , new institutions and there will be widespread corruption . 
  all these things will delay even more the development of the region that has been trough some catastrophic wars not so long ago . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what is your profession ? 
  that 's what i was asking . 
  why did they drop 2 ? 
  that means that one of the constituents of hdi must have dropped since last year . 
  is the life expectancy lower this year ? 
  did their gdp drop ? 
  what happened ? 
  of course . 
  but look at the context of my comment . 
  i was asking how many points did the us gained/lost compared to 2013 data . 
  the eu average would be +0,55 . 
  did we beat america ? 
  also , wtf is wrong with ireland ? 
  romanians wrote lots of jokes in the communist period . 
  during that time , for some reason ( probably lack of any other form of entertainment ) , writing jokes was extremely popular - everyone was doing it . 
  nowadays , we have a bigger collection of jokes than most other countries . 
  also , there are lots of international jokes that caught on in multiple countries that originate from romania . 
  we probably have jokes about each and every nationality on the planet , so do n't take offence if you 're albanian . 
  the jokes about russians are quite old . 
  they are from communist times , mostly . 
  they usually portray russians as being drunkards or they make fun of soviet hypocrisy . 
  most of our racial/stereotypical jokes are about gypsies . 
  we also have jokes about moldovans , hungarians and russians . 
  however , i 'll try to entertain you with some jokes about romanians , as we probably wo n't hear any otherwise . 
  q : what 's big , black , noisy , makes a lot of smoke and cuts carrots in five ? 
  a : the romanian machine for cutting carrots in four . 
  big cataclysm in romania : 100.000 people perish . 
  immediately , europe offers aid : france : 100 tons of clothes england : 1 million pounds germany : 1000 tons of medicines austria : 10 tons of food italy : 100,000 romanians a gorgeous country ... a pity it 's inhabited . 
  i 'm looking forward seeing a lost american , paranoid about what he can and ca n't do . 
   ) this thread probably fucked with you more than it helped you . 
   do take off your shoes when entering someone 's home . 
  yup . 
  same here . 
  you 'd make a perfect `` grumpy old man '' . 
  why do n't we continue the `` which places should you visit in ... 
  as it 's not yet complete and it can even prove useful . 
  sadly , i was n't around back then . 
  i joined reddit only late last year . 
  :( at any rate , thanks for the great read !, 
  i loved it . 
  circlejerking was always one of our favorite pastimes . 
  however , [ bashing americans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23tzy7/the_eu_as_a_world_power/ ) meant double the fun . 
  [ communication is always healthy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25da2d/why_russians_do_not_understand_why_eastern/ ) in a troubled relationship . 
  i really enjoyed the discussion that we , eastern and central europeans had with our `` buddy '' russia . 
  apparently , they do n't understand why we 're mad at them . 
  we love to [ celebrate ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2am225/the_world_cup_remains_with_europe_germany_have/ ) as well from time to time . 
  celebration requires [ music ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/257839/eurovision_song_contest_2014/ ) . 
  i think everyone agrees . 
  oh , and a personal favorite : [ albania - putin 's nightmare . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/210l5n/putin_it_is_just_a_matter_of_time_for_you_now/ ), 
  i do n't know any romanian who would say they have a negative feeling towards denmark . 
  you guys would have probably gotten a 99.9 % approval rate . 
  i do n't eat any sweets , so i had no idea about this campaign . 
  i really thought they changed the wrapping to the american flag . 
  i was boiling with anger halfway though the video . 
   ) they even made an [ anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uffb0rvwvea ) for the chocolate , it seems . 
  this is a classic example of stupid fucking romanian negativism and ignorance . 
   standing up for his beliefs is exactly what he did !, 
  well , most people hate american foreign policy , that 's for sure . 
  however , 90 % of people would move to america instantly if you 'd provide them a house and a good job . 
  the question is : what opinion do you have about x country ? 
  the answers are : rather positive , rather negative or do n't know/not answering . 
  so it 's not really hate . 
  even though our 2 countries are often times clamped together in western media , we do n't really have much in common . 
  people here do n't think about bulgaria all that often . 
  also , now and then , there are negative stories in the media about you guys . 
  negative in the sense that they are warning tourists to be careful of scammers when they travel to bulgaria and things like that . 
  i disagree with you . 
   they took northern bucovina ( which i do n't think we care about btw ) 99.99 % of people do n't give a shit about that anymore , so that probably has no influence . 
   current conflict does n't make it look nice even if we do n't like their aggressor actually , this conflict made romanians empathize with ukrainians . 
  it 's a `` the enemy of our enemy is our friend '' type thing . 
  also , romanian coverage of the conflict clearly paints the russia and the russian rebels as being the bad guys . 
  so it 's pretty clear there . 
  the actual reason they rank so low ( in my opinion ) is because they 've always been a regional bully .
