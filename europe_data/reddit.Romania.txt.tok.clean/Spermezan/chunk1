the celts were a lot more closer , with almost everybody , including with ourselves , than you might think . 
  but ... but paolo ... u can not into space . 
  u knows this . 
  czech ... mate ? 
  the price of xenophilia ... 
  assimilation = / = integration, 
  you & others like you must stop self-inferiorizing as well . 
  with that attitude , we wo n't get anywhere !, 
  i hope some myths about the germans are busted , so that others stop acting so self-inferiorizing . 
   nah , i prefer to refer to it as sanity . 
  yep , paranoia of fearing what you do n't know about and ca n't anticipate . 
  tsk , tsk , such civilisation : fear . 
  plus authoritarian-totalitarian inclination of deciding for others what they can have & ca n't have . 
  now i see how americans , with all their vices included , managed to become powerful . 
   thankfully , it 's never happen here because most people are at least sane . 
  you tell me , you still have people that claim they 're `` above the man 's law '' . 
  well ... that 's * your * problem . 
   just flooding the country with guns wo n't help keep the military under civilian control . 
  then renounce your 2nd amendment , why do n't ya . 
  confiscate all the firearms that your conationals have and ... hope for the all mighty wo n't pound you so hard . 
  or are you thinking of cia incursion type of flooding guns ? 
  'cause that would be a topic to discuss for at least 5 hours or so . 
  if legalisation for availability on the market means `` flooding of * ... * '' , then we might have different perceptions on the matter . 
   how about no . 
  who are you to decide for millions ? 
  i know you might have some authoritarian-totalitarian inclination , since you might be english , but not everybody will agree with you . 
  and , to top it off , it 'd be your choice whether you 'd want guns , or not , to buy . 
   we 've managed quite well so far without . 
  ahh , another british thinking cctvs prevent deaths & accidents from happening . 
  or that blades ( kitchen knives , military knives ... ) , substances ( rat poison ... ) & othe forms of killing that do n't include firearms are n't still used for crime . 
  you ~ ~ should ~ ~ must ban those as well , to show you 're committed . 
   how many coup d'etats do you think the uk has had without arming its population ? 
  do i look like the independent to you ? 
   let 's not mass introduce weapons into the civilian population because of a comment from an anonymous person , that would probably file as one of the biggest over-reactions of the millennium . 
  we 've managed quite well so far without . 
   how about that does n't become part of the future . 
    be smart and take it as a scare tactic . 
  i hope it does , actually , for you . 
  these types of scaremongering should teach you a lesson why firearms are essential for civilians . 
  into submission ... 
  lem me guess ... paranoia , it has to be paranoia of the sudden self-preservation disappearance . 
  am i correct ? 
  something among the lines of `` oh my gooooood , if we legalize firearms , then , everybody would shoot everybody !!! 1 !, 
  '' ; let alone the fact that this is the most stupidest fear , the sudden lack of self-preservation , i 've ever seen/heard , and this is coming from a guy with a country of ardent orthodox christians . 
  it 's paranoia . 
  one more thing : even if * you * do n't want guns , it 's your choice to not buy one , if legalisation would ( and hope will ) happen . 
   no thanks , it might suit some places but we 're more likely to sit down and have a serious chat about it all over a nice cup of tea . 
  like the same way you had , with that referendum-type , in 1848 ? 
   but in the end it has to stay under civilian control . 
  i do n't ever recall the uk having , before or after ecsc , up to present , legalized firearms like in the usa . 
  ** that ** is your best chance and a more firm , yet direct , form of civilian control i 've ever seen : armed civilians . 
  be smart and take it as a scare tactic . 
  however , given the opposite circumstance , this is another reason why , despite being technologically inferior but massive in numbers , nations must legalize firearms on the market for their `` civvies '' . 
  while civilians would not have access to sensitive hardware like the military has , * yet * ( i suppose ) , this is one reason that any general with dissent , because his/her personal views are n't met by votes , would think twice before staging a coup d'etat . 
  `` every nation gets the government it deserves '' , as a gentleman once said . 
  and nobody , not even the military , has no say other than `` sir , yes sir ! '' . 
  while some of our british are rightfully anti-corbyn , these type of statements must n't be welcomed , even if your deep state or tptb did this under the clear sunlight , for once . 
  nope , i doubt it . 
  no , neither * you * nor * us * are `` first among equals '' . 
  for the `` first among equals '' , it 's absolutely alright to break protocol , but if somebody else do it , maybe a smaller nation , it 's cheating of eu rules . 
  you 've written `` first among equals '' wrong . 
  most voters in romania vote just so they can have somebody to blame at for the conditions the country is having . 
  let alone the lack of protests , revolts and so on . 
  * childhood, 
  * only * religion ? 
  let 's take a 2nd look :  three old , tired , teachers forged by the mechanisms of the old regime ;  an old priest that probably was an informant or had to be an asshole & not retire without making a seat available for the younger generation of priests ( aka . 
  those who were n't informants )  a policeman that probably is sitting in the bushes during duty & waiting to bait for easy money because a driver that , god-forbid , dared to exceed the snail 's speed , only this time he has to pretend to read at a ceremony  a popular teddy bear , whose name i forgot , is trying very hard to somehow brighten up the situation in a boring , hour-long , useless , ceremony filled with communist contrasts to it  future pupils that will have to endure the obligatory 12 years of ...  the parents ( unseen ) in the backround that do n't actually give a damn about their kids ' education but are there just to remind themselves that they are parents , let alone the grandparents that 'll be doing the obligation for them instead, 
  because communist nostalgia .

  as one of freemasonry 's popular mottos , * ordo ad chaos * ( order out of chaos ) , everything has a target with lots n ' lots of collateral damage .

  gypsies with romanian citizenship . 
  obligatory : citizenship = / = nationality . 
  if i 'd want to apply for a czech citizenship , that would make me czech on paper , not for real . 
  what ganimede wrote , `` that 's all that matters now '' , is partially true * only * if you see it from the realpolitik viewpoint . 
   the thing is they want germany or nordics due to dublin accord . 
  i [ do n't understand .

   it 's kinda funny to me , though , to see even syrian refugees looking down on romania . 
  collectivism has always been linked with extreme/radical center , center-left and left-wing . 
  maybe some variations of center-right ( depending upon interpretation ) , but even that is n't absolute . 
  so , the answer is no , it certainly can not be . 
  collectivism is n't right-wing . 
   i 'm not paranoid , just trying to imagine vaslui county ... with guns . 
  there 's simply no way this could be a good thing . 
  yes , because everyone is a psychopath , with no fear of death/sin/god / other * or * mindfulness for their families and their future * or * a mutual respect due to fear acknowledging others have guns * or * moral dilemmas , risk their lives , provoke gunfights to ultimately get killed themselves by other people with guns . 
  newsflash : only outlaws have no problem with those conditions . 
  yeah , moreover , let 's leave ourselves disarmed , innocent people with no inspiration for bloodlust , that might get raped/mugged/harassed / blackmailed/beaten/tortured / killed & have our friends or loved ones face the same , while outlaws can get their weapons via illegal channels that , the regular civilian , would not know of . 
  like , that 's why they 're called `` outlaws '' in the first place . 
  oh , bonus points for outlaws to come in packs/gangs and with help/favoritism from police or the [ local ] administration such as what happend in timisoara . 
  when the justice system does n't work , and the system rigged as a whole , vigilantism is your last resort to normality . 
   vaslui county i wonder what would you have done if you were the * father * of that girl . 
   yeah , because you ca n't get more 5000 people to protest some idiotic law , surely we would have vigilante corruption hunters having a lethargic population ( ourselves included ) does n't help either . 
   no , the ony thing a `` 2nd amendment '' would do here is increase the murder and accidental gun deaths rate . 
  now you 're paranoid ; do n't forget your tin foil hat . 
  oh , of course , and the obligatory `` do n't worry , the police & secret services will protect us , no worries '' . 
  guess why * we * still have corruption and having corrupt willy-nillies still free at large . 
  i 'll give you a hint : lack of a 2nd amendment of our own .
