  i wonder if frank knows what *** liberation theology *** is , let alone the jesuits being in favor for it . 
   * rom * garians ** that 's ** why . 
   monetary policy . 
  generalisation , not detailed . 
  do n't write if you really have nothing of value to prove/show . 
  alright , and the non-skeptics would ask you from what do you base your claims/worries on . 
  what 's your response , `` i 've looked on the internet '' ? 
  * do n't get me wrong , i do n't give a rat 's ass on somebody else 's economy , but i want to point out an obvious slice that you 're missing it deliberately or unwillingly . 
  do * you * know what the european central bank or your osterreichsche nationalbank does right now , what meetings , what decisions , what actions will be taken now or in the next weeks ? 
  do you ? 
  are you part of it ? 
  if your response is `` 9 '' , you are n't different from the average greek . 
  this is why i envy the usa 's 2nd amendment . 
  this and for any other potential invasion force , government corruption ... 
  the red line agreement ? 
  c'mon , tell us !, 
  pseudosciene or not , i find this creepily similar to some aspects * we * have in terms of ... trauma passed through our great grandparents & beyond . 
  they 're veeeeeeeery late on that . 
   oh , we really need to protect our children from this shit , can you imagine a child seeing a grown man 's weenie ? 
  bet he will be traumatized for life , he 'll need psychological counselling , maybe even psychiatric medication . 
   seriously , what the hell is wrong with these people , we have nude beaches in romania as well , there are naked people and kids around , nobody gives a fuck . 
  if you do n't want your kid to see naked people on the beach , well , then do n't take your kid on the beach . 
  unsee that . 
  when you see middle-aged , old , persons already through their second puberty in life ( the milestone most known as menopause and andropause ) , with old skin , cellulite , hanging tits and/or man boobs , *** then , and only then , *** you may have your discussion with sunburned penises & ugly vaginas . 
  i would n't want to see that and i 'm not a kid . 
  if a kid would see that , especially at a ( n ) [ old/middle-aged ] woman , i would n't be surprised if that kid would be horrified or disgusted of women later in life . 
  my guess would be this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group_of_ten_ ( economic ), 
  you could make an ` all-in-one ' type of law . 
  you forget that the secret services can blackmail you into submission . 
  let me answer you that before the facebook generation pupil returns . 
  the wallachian flag you see as his flair is a fairly new re-imagined design done in 2008 . 
  there are several variation of it . 
  the bird always varied : [ the golden eagle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_eagle ) , [ the roman aquila ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aquila_ ( roman ) ) , a grey/white eagle or hawk or falcon ( do n't ask me about this one ) , [ the raven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raven ) , and a hybrid half-eagle half-raven ( what you see now ) . 
  the cross was always present , whether in his beak or floating . 
  the half-moon is n't present in some versions . 
  often , the bird is depicted as flying but in some versions , like the one in the flair , it is standing on a tree or [ a parcel of land ] ( http://www.fahnenversand.de/fotw/images/r/ro-wallvin.gif ) ( again , a modern re-imagined according to historical sources ) . 
  the story behind it ? 
  history , fellow dane , it 's all about history and the surroundings during those times . 
   we inherited and had so many relations with the french that we were basically a french colony , and as a french colony who just took their flag and placed yellow instead of white , which chad and andorra probably did too , therefore the similar flags ... lol . 
  the fact that you wrote `` lol '' at the end does n't give you any more credibility . 
  `` colony '' ?? 
  we had several generations with hard-ons for the old , dead , french culture , that does n't fucking mean a thing you nitwit !, 
  it *** really *** depends on whom you ask . 
  the old * er * generations say the blue represents peace , the yellow represents abundance or self-sustenance ( allusion into making things better ) , and red represents the blood of our ancestors & the people that tried & continues to * try * to build a better future for their kids/grandkids/grandgrandkids . 
  the old generations say the blue represents western europe , the yellow represents our `` base '' , and red represents [ the red plague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism ) : west-we-east . 
  the generation borned just before the '89 revolution or coup d'etat - meaning they were n't even 18 when the iron curtain collapsed , they were at least preteenagers - say the blue represents the ideal , the yellow represents the potential , and red represents the sewage the red plague left behind and is still being felt today . 
  the generations of whom i am the closest , in the grey area ( meaning i 'm neither part nor excluded ) , say the blue represents the future ( good/excellent ) , the yellow represents the present ( it 's piss-poor but not horrible , still a lot of work to do ) , and red represents our history of terror and not being left alone to evolve like the west did + allusion to recent history regarding communism , ottoman-habsburg-tsarist terror , and so on . 
  the young generation of whom i 'm also the closest and yet not included nor excluded ( though , i 'm an early post-decembrist ) is a mixture in itself : it either repeats what the past generations have said ( and does different combos ) , either say their own interpretation * or * , as a fairly new trend , say that the combination of blue-yellow-red has been documented since the days of the dacians/thracians/thracodacians / dacothracians on the draco ( n ) and they 're more accustomed to us than it is to other countries that adopted the vertical tricolore . 
  in short , in case you did n't noticed it , my generation lives in limbo . 
  no use if almost all of them remain in awe & feeling subordinated under what the german chancellor - or * the german * in general - says . 
   capitalism could never exist without a state . 
  the black market , the grey market , smugglers , bitcoin & the deepweb disagree with you . 
   the state is the result of irreconcilable class differences in society . 
  the state is the result of coercion by a bunch of people , vile and/or stupid filled with greed , in which they think there can not exist order without mandatories , force & authority . 
  add tributes ( taxation ) & bribery and you have your usual potpourri we know today . 
  i call it the `` legal mafia '' sometimes . 
   in a capitalist system with no state , what prevents the workers from taking what is rightfully theirs ? 
  nothing , and they would do so until the capitalists form a state to stop them . 
  in a capitalist society , in which the `` capitalist system with no state '' assertion is a fallacy since capitalism = / = state with no common ground , the workers would n't have anything to take back what they 'd perceive as `` rightfully theirs '' . 
  that 's called theft . 
  and what 's rightfully mine , and not what is perceived as `` theirs '' , would be protected from such theft conspiracy using any means necessary , any tools & any ways possible , from private security firms/forces , to personal protection . 
  why should i pay tribute ( aka . 
  tax ; aka . 
  protection racket ) to the mafiosi state that i could provide using without it ? 
  what you perceive freedom as to kill because of collective motivations ( `` taking back what 's ours '' , aka . 
  theft ) , sociopathy , psychopathy and downright mass murder mentality ( gee , where did i heard/see that before ? 
  ) ; i perceive freedom , as to protect what 's yours by any means neccesary from such goons that want to burn everthing to ashes just because they were too stupid , too narrow-minded , and too vile to adapt to these norms in society . 
  after all , what they do n't like , they are free to leave , they 're not forced to work for me if they do n't want to . 
  in consequence , if people like me were to be killed by such goons , the dark ages would return again , steadfast . 
  over time , those goons would sign their deaths themselves . 
  capitalism is the ` extraction ' of value by the entity or entities , which own ( s ) the means of production , to supply the market 's demand and its use to enable further extraction as long as there is demand of that value . 
  nobody can foresee when value becomes an excess , therefore a waste . 
  no statistic , no economist , no warren buffet can anticipate such an occurence ; unless you have the oracle of delphi & nostradamus by your side . 
   ~ ~ state capitalism ~ ~ statism is when that entity is the state . 
  ftfy . 
  the * state * and * capitalism * have as much common ground together as black holes with living or non-living entities . 
  - statism - capitalism pick one . 
  you should put a reminder that this is pretty much arbitrary and subjective , rather than `` what does your * whole * country sees an event '' . 
  dissolved ... as early as possible ... hopefully . 
   `` it 's just a way to show people in the uk that immigrants are an important part of britain . 
  we want to make the point that we are here and that we want to feel appreciated , '' he said . 
  the motives are dull , the initiative is based on personal hypocrisy and , overall , looks to be commanded as an order ( political ) . 
  if they were ex-romanian romanians & gypsies , i would n't be able to tell the difference : cosmopolites . 
  do n't forget the * / s * at the end . 
  it 's their job to do this . 
  they 've done this public burst out of the sudden as if it was n't their task before and , suddenly , they have this responsibility . 
  i was n't borned yesterday , and if it was something political , no worries : the us , uk et ceteri embassies would ~ ~ dictate ~ ~ ( oops , the `` d '' word , my bad ) tell our politicians to not touch our ` justice ' . ^ ** !, 
  *** as a sidenote : do you think foreign embassies scolded merkel and her justice minister that what they 've done to harald range was an attack on the independent justice ? 
  if the case were in our country , even merkel would 've called her concern on our ` independent ' justice . 
  * instead of doing what they 're supposed to do , and * then * show off what they 've achieved , they decided to go public and announce something they 're supposed to do in the first place . 
  as i pointed out , it is odd enough to take this as a warning to certain people and trigger them to hide their ill-gotten gains . 
  it 's not illegitimate nor incorrect to consider this as an option on the table . 
  it seems , on the other hand , that tv and facebook are your only newsfeed which you label as infallible . 
  it 's awesome to let others think for you , is n't it ? 
  in short , you 're naive . 
  ( * just so i would n't need to call you an outright idiot * ) noapte buna . 
   romania 's tax authorities say * they will * investigate the country 's big earners , including celebrities , moneylenders and pop stars , to verify the sources of their incomes . 
  as you can read , they did n't do jack * - * but declare they 'll do something . 
  well , well , well , until i do n't see those ` certain ' rich ~ ~ gypsies ~ ~ ~ ~ roma ~ ~ ~ ~ rroma ~ ~ non-romanian `` romanians '' arrested and condemned for real ( not another circus tv ) , it 's just smokescreen for artificial positiveness . 
  ** one curiosity to think about ** : is n't it odd that they declare they 'll do something , rather than actually doing it without public notice ?
