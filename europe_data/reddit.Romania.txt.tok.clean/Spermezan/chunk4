   the last thing we need is a bunch of people making far-right noises . 
  if this was done to prevent any type of backdoor intrusion , just as what happened with france 's national front & russian banks , using the pretext `` you 're allowed to say whatever we let you say until we do n't like it '' , it 's going to be counterproductive on the long run . 
  also , history-wise motivation , very , very dumb . 
   are people supposed to shut up and take it because the same shit has been happening for decades ? 
  you have no idea how much , of the same pretext , have been said here with the answer `` yes '' . 
  in an oddly way , yes . 
  as a romanian , baptized as an orthodox christian , i approve it . 
  why ? 
  because if this [ monstruosity ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2013/11/08/527cf8f6c7b855ff56d14d4e/646x404.jpg ) has been approved to be build with the help of taxpayer money , and since most of our countrymen are religious ( not quite faithful , ironically ; it 's a big difference ) , then why the hell shall we ignore a big mosque ? 
  why spite one megalomaniac project with another that is currently being built ? 
  erdogan was an idiot : he should 've said that the mosque will be built with our taxpayer money as well . 
  then , probably , nobody would 've `` rally against '' or bat an eye in the first place . 
  one more thing to consider : 1 ) all muslims are terrorists . 
  ( bias ) 2 ) all terrorists are [ extremist ] muslims . 
  ( not bias ), 
   who the hell is saying otherwise ? 
  the mainstream mass-media & the `` specialists '' in economics . 
  we have our own here , do n't act like you have n't heard our goons pretexting the same ol' `` lazy , evil , greeks that do n't want to pay their debts to the innocent creditors '' . 
   yes , he did inherit the debt , but he also inherited an economy that was just starting to heal itself according to whom ? 
  the german , french , dutch , italian and spanish creditors ?!, 
  it was acknowledged that everything was a grand scheme of whitewashing money through legalized launder . 
  the greek economy was on artificial life support through austerity and returning the same money , they loaned , back to the german , french , dutch , italian & spanish banks or industries . 
  the bigger the sum was sent , the bigger the whitewash money launder was plus the interest they promised ; aside that the money was sent back , they promised every time to return the interest as well . 
  whoop-de-fuckin ' - doo , there 's your `` healing '' process . 
   and seriously damaged it , for no real reason , other than throwing a tantrum in front of everybody . 
  [ and here 's my cue * only * for you . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/3carng/parabola_greciei_si_al_romaniei_vizand/ ) a tantrum of which they were n't responsible for the damage made by the friends of epp . 
  how 's that for `` no reason '' ? 
  of course , as the mediocre romanian line of thought goes ...  the effects of this will be really long term , [ ... ] but unfortunately people never seem to learn , i 'll guarantee you that , in less than 15 years , they 'll still live in better conditions than we will . 
   but unfortunately people never seem to learn , hmpgh , that 's gold : a romanian preaching greeks about their livestyle . 
  so , how 's our country doing in terms of gdp , hdi , debt-to-income ratio , public debt , external debt , industries & industrial complexes , commercial trades , budget surplus/balance , low taxes , low commissions , currency deflation , [ over ] evaluation & appreciation etc. ? 
  yeah , you 're a blatant hypocrite . 
   they will continue to blame the imf , troika etc. 
  the troika , yes , with all the reasons . 
  the imf , only the nitwits which do n't know what happened . 
   undergrad girl beaten up because *** his *** boyfriend was mistaken for an immigrant so the `` girl '' is a homosexual boy ? 
  how many are legit ? 
  him & syriza inherited the debt , they did n't caused it . 
   the entire uk constitution rests on the principle of parliamentary sovereignty . 
  the parliament can do what it wants , when it wants , and no preceding parliament can bind it it . 
  we 're quite clearly a parliamentary democracy , even though parliament can change that . 
  we quite clearly have human rights protections , even though they can be taken away at the click of westminster 's fingers . 
  ... that can be swindled at a snip . 
   just because something is n't constitutionally entrenched , it does n't follow that it does n't exist . 
  the uk operates in a decentralised manner . 
  that 's reality . 
  there is no illusion there . 
  can that be changed ? 
  yes , though politically its be hard going . 
  it is n't . 
  you cherish a bunch of principles , delimitations & exemptions that can be connived easily into being overridden or abolished . 
  however , how can some thing/things can be claimed as `` overridden '' or `` abolished '' if they were n't set into the proverbial stone in the first place ? 
  appearances ? 
  social engineering & construct ? 
  '' [ mutual ] trust '' ? 
  i 'm sorry for you , lad , but you ca n't outsmart the political doubletalk . 
  just to give a basic example : * de jure * is n't the same as * de facto * . 
  they do n't exist if they were left intetionally to hang over the abyss in such a volatile & moribund , vague-pretexted , status . 
   does it matter ? 
  no , not really . 
  so you , personally , do n't give a damn if they were to be overriden or abolished , yet make a fuss out of it like it 's the magna carta . 
  uuh-huh , okay ...  if the uk operates like this for 100 years , say , at what point does it stop becoming an illusion to you ? 
  the benefits ( or disbenefits ) of that decentralisation would still be accruing so ... ? 
  correlation does n't imply causation . 
  thin rope that can be easily cut off by the will of the government and its red tape is , still , a thin rope that can be easily cut off ` if they want to ' . 
  if decentralisation can be reversed back to centralisation because the government believes it suits them on that particular moment , then there was no factual decentralisation to begin with , only the illusion to it . 
  it is what it is . 
  if you refuse to see it for what it is ... bummer , i guess . 
   the uk central parliament can , at will , override any decision by any of the lower tiers of government . 
  that makes it unitary . 
  i would n't & do n't consider the uk a unitary , decentralised , nation if the government can snip its fingers and undo the changes back to centralisation ` if it wants to ' . 
   the contrast is with , for example , a federal country , where the lower tiers are sovereign and can only be overruled on particular matters . 
  i do n't see it that different , honestly ; the downside with federalism in terms of decentralisation and governmnet , apart from the `` overruled on particular matters '' part , is that there is a lot more bureaucracy . 
  in my own view , federalism is ` bureaucratic decentralisation ' , unless there ever was or is a decentralisation without more bureacuracy & red tape than what , already , exists . 
   the issue is , centralised was scored out and replaced by unitary . 
  the latter does n't imply the former , and that 's what was important . 
  if the latter hangs on a thin rope that the former could cut off in a second , then there is no decentralised unitary state to begin with . 
  the concept of `` leaving everything on [ mutual ] trust '' is foolish and easy to belittle or , worse , corrupt it to its bone marrow . 
  opinions vary , yes , but if it can be reversed back to centralisation in an instant , there there 's the illusion of a decentralised unitary state . 
   a country *** can be unitary *** * without being centralized . 
  * unitary * simply means * that ** the central government reigns supreme ** and can choose which powers it delegates to local authorities . 
  where 's the contradiction , then ? 
   and can choose which powers it delegates to local authorities . 
  that 's called `` decentralisation '' . 
   romania is very centralized because local authorities have very little power and are dependent on how much money the government decides to give them . 
  if it were to give them power , that would still be decentralisation . 
   i 'm all for reducing vat , but as isarescu points out , and the eu commission , this will lead to a switch to deflation and a big gap in government budget . 
  it 's something that needs to be done by 1 % over the course of a few years . 
  being prudent and thinking long-term is the way to address changes in the fiscal code , and not overnight . 
  then , there 's draghi ... 
   romania is a ~ ~ very centralized ~ ~ unitary country . 
  ftfy . 
  `` by being in the euro , greeks had access to easy money ; they took loans and used that borrowed money to buy high-end goods like cars and electronics , many of which came from germany . 
  well , * in theory * , this 'd be a two-way street . 
  it was n't because germans were n't borrowing euros to go buy clams from a guy named stavros . 
  so , money was leaving greece but it was n't coming back . '', 
  - seth meyers , *** late night with seth meyers *** i have a question for the irish , portuguese , spaniards , italians & greeks : have you ever heard complaints from your own countrymen , especially from those with [ some ] knowledge on economics , that this type of inequity ( not `` inequality '' ) is extremely bias and counterproductive , a lack of * qui ( d ) pro quo * , on a grand picture of things ? 
  i mean , for when your country was borrowing and bought from imports . 
  after all , not to depress our greek users any further apart from what they experience right now , tourism ** is n't ** an industrial complex nor a commercial-based , global covered , tertiary and/or quaternary sector either . 
  * slow clap *,
