  be specified the next time you make ambiguous claims like that . 
  this is n't about the commonality the minimum wage has , it 's about the claim that both , minimum and average , are `` constantly increasing '' . 
  * late edit * in the public or private sector . 
  it was n't about minimum wages , it was about him claiming about minimum wages and salaries increasing . 
  then why did you claimed that `` minimum and average salaries are constantly increasing '' ? 
  you did n't specified if they 're from the private or public sector . 
  huh ? 
  tpp , not tipp ? 
  do n't ask for voting rights , then . 
   later edit : this is the same pm who reduced the number of voting polls outside romania in order to prevent people from voting against him 7 months ago . 
  i queued to vote for 7 hours one day , then 10 hours the other day , and i was n't allowed to vote ( against him ) in the end because the polling stations had closed in the evening . 
  one more correction on the matter : the same thing happened in 2009 , it was much worse , yet nobody complained . 
  just so to point out the level of bias , right dkrandu ? 
  imtranslator . 
  google translator 's quick highlight & translate . 
  it 's ok , if you need a quick translation on the spot . 
  raw translation :  we need genuine initiatives for growth and development in greece . 
  we will not find a solution when the plan for my country is to push pensions to a level as in croatia or in other balkan countries or sack us . 
  one can not romania and bulgaria have in the eu and negotiating for years with turkey , and greece from the european family out crowd . 
   i just quoted the law mentioning the immunity against * searches * and * arrests * , i never said he can not be prosecuted or convicted . 
  *** preventive *** arrests and *** abusive *** searches *** without probe/evidence *** to support precedents . 
  i wrote it once and i 'll write one last time : stop doing word twisting . 
   all subsequent paragraphs are just as ridiculous . 
  i see no point in wasting my time with you , since you either fake or are unable to comprehend your own quotes , my quotes and my messages . 
  for anyone wondering , this is how an * ad hominem * looks like . 
  e circ mediatic . 
   by germany and france , who feared the decision would anger russia . 
  same thing with romania before 2004 . 
  and now , i see most of my countrymen praising the germans and french . 
  the law also says :   art . 
  which translates as :   in case of [ a ] flagrant crime ( s ) , ** deputies can be detained and searched . 
  ** the situation will be brought up promptly/immediately to the minister of justice . 
  the minister of justice shall promptly inform the president of the chamber of deputies about the detention and search . 
  if the chamber finds no grounds for detention , it shall order the repeal of this measure/procedure . 
   so no matter what evidence the prosecutors bring , the pm can not be searched , especially related to his actions while being a member of the chamber of deputies . 
  you 're avoiding it : there is n't any immunity to anybody but the president . 
  he and the others are protected to potential abusive [ preventive detention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preventive_detention ) / arrest and ilegal searches without probe/evidence . 
   / u/spermezan , i see the pro-socialist-party bias in your comments throughout reddit and i have nothing against that , but please try to come up with evidence to support your claims next time and especially when you contradict someone else . 
  / u/dkrandu , for your own information : i 'm not a socialist nor have any support or sympathy for left-wing ideologies . 
  i am a libertarian minarchist , believe it or not . 
  *** however *** ... 
  i have no tolerance for hypocrisy , abusiveness , false accusations , media/populist bias and word twisting semantics ; all filled with character assassinations just because somebody is from a different party or has different way of thinking . 
  just like you did , prejudicing with `` the pro-socialist-party bias in your comments '' , labelling with character assassination with me . 
  i see a lot of these done by shills paid by the secret service . 
  the europeans do n't know this situation , despite flashy news alerts . 
   this way you 'd look less like a paid commenter . 
  the perception is mutual , from now on , if that 's what you want . 
  candva , in viitor , in vremuri nescrise si nestiutoare . 
  normal . 
   simply put , you can go the dna and declare that some politician asked you for a bribe all day long , he 'll never actually have a charge brought against him until there 's other evidence to support your claim . 
   found the guy that watches too much antena3 . 
  prejudice and character assassination . 
  still , you avoided my questions . 
   that 's retarded , we have the assumption of innocence until proven guilty just like every other country . 
  if i go to the anti-corruption agency , testimonying against a politician or minister or prime minister , the second day we 'd see flashy news alerts that the x politician/minister/prime-minister has been charged on corruption/theft/money laundering/etc . 
  and that we 'd hear people saying `` wow , good job anti-corruption agency !, 
  '' ; however , what good work ? 
  if my testimony does n't bear any evidence against the said politician/minister/prime-minister , what happens next ? 
  a lot of character assassination . 
  ffs sake , how many people know the difference between an arrest and preventive detention/arrest ? 
  most would say it 's the same thing . 
  everybody , the pm included , can get searched and declared guilty as long as the prosecutors bring evidence . 
  however , this is character assassination . 
  no different than what varoufakis or tsipras experienced . 
  one more thing : on his facebook , the pm included the saying `` proving my innocence '' . 
  it 's out of context , sure . 
   nobody was convicted without evidence , that 's just propaganda used by those who would justify their corruption by having us believe that they 're targeted politically and not because they stole millions from us . 
  the old crew ( 2004-2014 ) did n't had anything coming to them . 
  where 's the fleet ? 
  where 's alro ? 
  where are the monies from those illegal & corrupt property restitutions ? 
  or what about those pompous government spending when the country was agonising with the wage cuts , 24 % vat and layoffs , between 2009-2012/2013 ? 
  the ex-president sits comfortably without any worry in the world , barking from time to time just to remain relevant or because out of boredom , the rest of his old crew `` converted '' to the liberal party are left untouched and as a random example , mru back as the head of the foreign intelligence service . 
  short-memory spam i see ... 
  anti-corruption agency + the secret service = love . 
  in romania , unlike other countries , you have to prove your innocence than being `` innocent until proven guilty . '', 
  it 's not rainbows just because you see flashy titles . 
  the prosecutors did n't brought any evidences as of yet . 
  they 've charged him but the nail ends there . 
   as long as he 's got immunity , the anti-corruption agency can not ask for search warrants ( or arrest warrants ) . 
  he needs to postpone this as long as possible , so he 'll still be in office for a while . 
  no , the prosecutors must bring evidence , then he can be put into the searching procedure . 
  he is n't immune like the germanic president or the sailor president before him . 
  a charge must contain evidences . 
  there is n't one at the least atm . 
  like most of your own politicians , they can be charged , searched and prosecuted , however , your prosecutors must bring evidence to initiate this . 
  is n't this how it works in most of west europe ? 
  well , the same goes to this case : the prosecutors brough the charges but no evidence ( s ) atm . 
  think before you read . 
  this is the nation where you have to prove your innocence . 
  the pm refused to declare anything because the prosecutors could twist the testimony against him . 
  out of context bias . 
  change wo n't come by leaving everything nor those will do the change wo n't accept back those who left the community . 
  this guy , and the morons like him , want voting rights outside of romania . 
  can you fanthom that ? 
  they want to vote in the name of a country that they no longer live in , do n't pay taxes ( our version of the irs ) , yet they pay the taxes to the government of which country they now reside in . 
  go figure such mentality and narrow-minded perception ... and that 's the judgement of most expats : germanophile , degenerate morons . 
  not all of them , of course , but , whew , some of them are just as bad like these idiots here . 
  the fact that the propaganda of your situation , painted in such a simplistic picture , proves that . 
  i 'd say `` sorry '' for such a fuss the idiot poster and the shills have caused but , honestly , i ca n't be sorry for these type of morons and gullible sell-outs .
