thucydides distinguished between athens and sparta by pointing out that athens was close to the sea and had an excellent port , piraeus . 
  sparta , on the other hand , was not a maritime power . 
  a maritime power can engage in international trade in a way that a landlocked power can not . 
   therefore , the athenian is wealthy , but in that wealth there are two defects . 
  first , wealth creates luxury and luxury corrupts . 
  second , wider experience in the world creates moral ambiguity . 
  the title is a passive-aggressive innuendo . 
   imagine this , you have no job but want to start a business so you borrow 100 000 euros from the bank . 
  let me stop you right there . 
  no commercial bank , * ever * , will give an average joe , a willful one at that , enough money to start a solid , medium-huge , business ( a significant one ) . 
  no commercial bank will * ever * give anyone enough money to : buy the land , build the infrastructure ( hey , let 's make it a zero-start challenge . 
  why ? 
  because . 
  ) , the time to complete all of this , additional third party contracts ( builders , technicians , engineers for additional installments and so , so on ) , the equipment , the timespan of deliveries , the materials + taxes , taxes & taxes . 
  ** no ** bank will ever take this risk or consider this . 
  at best , you 'll see minor successful businesses with `` inclosed '' cycle structure : restaurants/fastfoods , transports ( vans or minivans ) , gyms , kiosks , web designing , carwashes , fruits & vegetables stands ( greenmarkets ) etcetera . 
  however , you 'll never read the next joe that builds another standard oil , another louis vuitton enterprise , pharmaceutical plants , commerce giant , natural resources giant , another microsoft/computer software-hardware producer , another carnegie , another standard motors , another banking entity etc. 
  * of course , all with different names and different product signature ( s ) , yet i hope you understand * . 
  never will you ever see this industrial-commercial complex development ever again . 
  and these , whether you agree with me or not , are the cornerstone of a powerful & influential economy . 
  yes , yes , private , not public . 
  so , pardon me if i do n't consider minor `` businesses '' with inclosed cycle , with no exports & influence , real businesses/enterprises , vital to an economy , any economy . 
  those cute , small , entities exist as long as there 's local flow . 
  the moment sh * ts hit the fan , the moment they go bankrupt . 
  a multinational or conglomerate or corporation or industrial complex or commerce giant ? 
  at worst they 'd have setbacks , personnel laid-offs & one or two lost bases or equipment ( due to costly maintenance ) , but never bankruptcy . 
  did you ever seen an average joe acomplish the same things all by itself ? 
  of course not . 
  and those are real economic structures that fuel an economy ; not kiosks , carwashes , gyms , transports and all other little kids , which only exist as long as there 's flow ( customers ) at a local level . 
   now imagine that a country used its loan to develop better infrastructure , fund business schools , and fund the education for statesmen . 
  the country can collect more taxes because the state is more well-developed and domestic businesses are making more money . 
  the country pays back the loan , with interest , but is still making more money after the loan is payed back than it otherwise would have had they not borrowed in the first place . 
  here 's a problem : a state can not create productive jobs . 
  my flair , my country , 45 years , and +26 years of crony capitalism & broken democracy ... 
  i do n't have to write much more . 
  plus , according to eu rules & regulations ( if you have n't read them , i suggest you do so ) , states can not finance individual entrepreneurs ( economic agents , let 's call them that ) to , magically , create industrial complexes , conglomerates , pharma giant ( s ) etcetera to , suddenly , stimulate the economy . 
  if that were the case , greece 's varoufakis would still be a finance minister . 
  there was the situation with the athens airport given on a plate to foreign interests and not sustained by the greek government . 
  are they the losers or the { bigger } winners ? 
   countries borrow because it is the smart thing to do . 
  what about the financial institutions from the countries that lend ? 
  until it 's time to repay . 
  question : do they find it acceptable because , either way , their matter on the issue is n't important ? 
  what an idiot . 
  sea-turtles , mate . 
  do n't mind me , just seeing the first phrase and it 's a tiny daunt . 
   common agricultural policy ( cap ), 
   roma that lived and live in romania are romanians they have no commonality with romania or us . 
  there you go again , the disinformation propagated by your tv , tabloids & internet is showing yet again . 
   just like the hungarians in the transylvania or the germans are . 
  funny you mentioned that , since you 've put a label on them during the process of calling them romanian . 
  pure doublethink . 
   great another conspiracy theorist . 
  debunk what 's wrong in what i 've said . 
  everything started with ngos . 
   look i do n't care if you think you know more of etymology than the people who work on it . 
  exactly , that 's why you 're indoctrinated about the matter : apathy & obliviousness  even if roma is associated with romania so be it , no . 
   gypsies means egyptian so as you can see words get different meanings with time . 
  '' \u0162igan , \u0163igani , tzigany '' has nothing in common with `` egyptian '' , ~ ~ yet you have a problem pronouncing it ~ ~ . 
  nah , better have `` roma/rroma '' , huh ? 
  better be one with the disinfo flow . 
   roma or romani is the correct way to adress them , s gypsie became derogatory in almost all europe ( for example in portugal and spain it 's totally ok to call them gitanos or ciganos ) . 
  so is `` tzygany '' . 
   to equate that to full blown racist attitude to them is despicable . 
  by all means , sperrel ... do live with them if you have no problem with them . 
  seems fair ? 
   even if the majority of them are scammers or thieves it 's still not correct to paint them all with the same brush . 
  if it looks like a duck , quacks like a duck , and it has that mentality ingrained in its psyche ... 
  sperrel , the `` roma/rroma '' is a perverted & false linguistic tautology that would only asimilate into being `` romanian '' ; which is horribly , falsely , erroneous . 
  how does it happen that in italy , portugal , spain & belgium , when i was having a time with new buddies , they asked me from where i came , i said i was romanian , and suddenly , blank faces : `` but ... but *** you do n't look like one *** '' . 
  do you understand me , man ?!?!? 
  i 'm tired of this facade , this disinformation , this bullshit !, 
  you , * you * , are all made ill , you 've been indoctrinated !, 
  tv , tabloids , internet ... and you know what 's wrong here ? 
  you , italians , french , dutch , belgian , english * etcetera * were indoctrinated to see no difference , due to this perverted , machiavellain , ill-propagation construct by ngos of these two words ( which is a playword of error linguistic ambivalence , `` egyptian '' and all of that ) , `` roma/rroma '' and `` romanian '' , as being one and the same . 
  and fuck lauren etter , james nash & natalia banulescu-bogdan . 
   this year , almost 1,800 romanians have been apprehended at the southern u.s. border , up from fewer than 400 in all of last year and just a few dozen in 2008 , according to government statistics . 
  they are propelled by an anti-immigrant wave sweeping europe and pushing the roma across the atlantic ocean . 
  holy shit , they 're naming them `` romanians '' . 
  who wrote this piece of garbage ?!, 
   `` every one of them claims to be roma , '' said daniel parks , a u.s. customs and border protection agent in the san diego region . 
  `` they claim they are part of that class that is persecuted by the government of romania . '' they 're not `` roma '' , they 're `` gypsies '' . 
  what they claim is of no importance . 
  they might as well claim they 're unicorns , that does n't make them such , now , does it . 
   `` they claim they are part of that class that is persecuted by the government of romania . '' idleness , theft , violence is n't tolerated by nobody . 
  oh , and they suddenly forgot about hand-offs by gvernemnt officials , no taxes , bills paid by the locak authorities ... `` persecuted '' but i actually wish they 'll get what they claim to have happened to them . 
   the roma -- who consider `` gypsy '' a pejorative -- neither does `` roma '' nor `` romanian '' is their official classification , if that 's the case . 
   of the more than 10 million across europe , most have settled in romania , bulgaria and hungary , where they tend to live on the fringes of society , often eking out a life of begging and odd jobs . 
  odd jobs such as theft ? 
  that 's an odd job ? 
  or collecting metals ? 
  gee , suddenly , education starts to be provokative , does n't it . 
   `` there 's a lot of prejudice against roma in almost every country in europe , '' said natalia banulescu-bogdan , assistant director of the international program at the washington-based migration policy institute . 
  gee , natalia , you do n't say . 
  and i suppose people get uppidy just ... without reason or motive or , dare i say , provokation ? 
   `` the stereotypes of them panhandling and engaging in petty thievery just stir up these prejudices . '' it is n't prejudice if it 's based within the group 's mindset/psyche & activity . 
   since romania and bulgaria joined the european union in 2007 , roma moving west to access labor markets have been met with mounting resistance . 
  out of the sudden ? 
  perhaps people sensed they have a * bad soul * , hm ? 
  ( you 'd understand this more if you knew the language , not about actual spiritism or religion ) .
