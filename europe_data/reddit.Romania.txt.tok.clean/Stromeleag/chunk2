   now , the roma are taking their chances in the u.s. 
  many are ending up in suburban los angeles . 
  besides the mean joke of `` living in a state where there are more mexicans '' ( i 've heard this from stand-up comedies ) , do n't let them take root , treat them as any other illegal , outcast , gang . 
   some find housing in common apartments , trailer trash . 
   while others simply pitch tents in a public park until they can secure a roof over their heads . 
  good luck with that , without them begging again or complaining . 
  but never lift a finger , that 's for sure . 
   they sometimes find work as nighttime janitors or in restaurants , oh , i know what they 're doing . 
  soon , they 'll ask for a toll just to enter the toilet . 
   while others resort to begging on the street old habits die hard , right ? 
  yet they complain that they 've left europe based on `` intolerance '' , while resorting to these idleness & theft activities that got them into trouble in the first place . 
  today , they `` resort '' to begging on the street , tomorrow , you 'll find them on the road , at the traffic lights , `` cleaning '' your windshield . 
  you do n't have to ask them , they 'll just do it out of the sudden , with cheap dish soap . 
   or receiving assistance from one of two roma churches in the area . 
  * gypsy churches . 
    st mary 's romanian orthodox church in anaheim , california . 
  it 's not `` romanian '' if it 's main attendees are gypsies . 
   `` my desire is jesus '' in romanian , accompanied by an electric violin and keyboard . 
  oooooh , so , in here , they speak their ... language ... however , outside , they have no problem talking in romanian . 
   romanescu , the man who arrived via mexico last year , stood among pews in a crisp blue dress shirt oh , if it 's in suburban los angeles , then , * maybe ... maybe ... *  he 'd rather forget the physical abuse and subtle but constant reminders of his second-class status -- having to wait longer for a doctor 's appointment , overcoming stereotypes that he 's a thief . 
  so , hygiene is applied only when told of , never on his own initiative ( pay attention to detail , folks , this is important when you want to find out a person 's character ) . 
  oh , if only the `` mean '' romanian government would 've told him to shave off his moustache , he 'd probably yell that he 's oppressed . 
  then , ngos would spurr out of nowhere ( kudos to george soros ) to protect the feeble gypsy from personal hygiene . 
  marvelous mental gymnastics for this conclusion , no words indeed . 
   the pastor at good samaritan , bobby moise , who fled the nicolae ceau\u0219escu dictatorship in 1987 , yeah , ceausescu probably forced him to work . 
   eagerly awaits arrivals like romanescu , who have doubled his pentecostal flock to more than 200 families since the church opened in 2010 . 
  he takes pride in helping his fellow roma find housing and god at the same time , while also reminding them of upcoming immigration-court appearances . 
    a business owner i heard certain churches in america are genuine bussinesses ( via television , * those * types ; like john oliver said ) . 
  while here , it 's more restrained , yet it requires real work to maintain . 
  seeing the keyword * pentecostal * ... hmm , i wonder if fellow pentecostals will be happy to know that their image is painted to be compared with idleness . 
   `` they 're putting their lives at risk coming across oceans and literally going through cartels and criminal gangs in mexico just to be able to arrive here , '' moise said . 
  day-to-day american citizens , the majority ones , are struggling with two jobs just to keep up with bills and offer their kids a favourable ambience , a good living even if it 's hard , and hope for the best in the future , honest living ; while this bozo , this fake-piano player , thinks leaving europe , because all of us are tired of their immoral , illegal activities , just to come to america for handouts & no work , means courage ? 
   moises travels back to the romanian countryside as a missionary and nurtures ties with religious leaders there . 
  `` religious leaders '' ... that 's a good joke , white lie ...  capitanu vasily my fucking sides , what 's next , general zika ? 
   `` for us , the ~ ~ romani ~ ~ gypsy people , america is a land of milk and honey , a land where we can become humans again , not outcasts , '' vasily said . 
  ftfy , and no , he 's not considering america the land of milk and honey the way you 'd think . 
  remember , idleness & theft is ingrained in their collective ( as virtues , as a matter of fact , they see no shame in that ) . 
  `` land of milk and honey '' translates to `` a naive cow ready to be milked to the last drop and honey , the goodies , provided by the rest while we sit and reap '' . 
   that there would be a tide of roma headed to america because of worsening conditions . 
  yes , when you steal , lie and idle , that tends to happen . 
  trust is * poof * gone . 
   luiza miller , a romanian immigration attorney in los angeles , said her caseload of roma asylum seekers has grown so large in recent years that they now represent a third of her clientele . 
   `` they figured out that it 's fairly easy to get in and that it 's not that harsh , '' said miller . 
  `` if they get apprehended by authorities they get out on bond or out on parole . 
  it 's not life-threatening . '' so ... trump is right , then . 
   even so , it 's not even a sure bet that the romanians who make it all this way will ultimately be allowed to stay . 
  there were 1,265 romanians in deportation proceedings for immigration violations as of august , up from fewer than 500 in all of last year , according to data from syracuse university 's transactional records access clearinghouse , a nonprofit that distributes government data obtained through freedom-of-information requests . 
  they.are . ** not ** . romanians . 
  fuck the `` roma/rroma '' denomination , it 's gypsy !, 
   since romanescu arrived in the u.s. , he 's been living with family in riverside while he waits for an immigration judge to determine whether he 'll qualify for asylum , a process that can take years . 
  he does n't mind the wait . 
  more like gypsynescu . 
  and guess what he does in his spare time . 
   `` i 'm not going back to romania , '' he said . 
  good . 
   `` i like it here . 
  a burden was taken from my shoulder . '' yea , yea ... when the americans will figure you out , you 'll be learning han chinese in hangzhou or korean in pusan . 
  `` roma gypsies '' ? 
  it 's gypsies !, 
  one word . 
  not post-lyceum ? 
  then this percentage is wrong & out of proportions . 
  if tertiary education is what i think it is , it 's because most of them were gutted between 2005-2008 , over here . 
  why ? 
  `` go to university '' , they said ... 
  they 're doing this to eliminate competition & espionage . 
  like i said , there 's no such thing as an `` ex-serviceman '' ( the israeli will continue to have backdoor with his security agency & buddies he 's worked with before ) , and if eu officials ( or congressmen , in your case , * if * the practice has n't been adopted yet ) can be easily spied upon from their vehicles `` in the name of national security '' , that capability will be used as blackmail & control . 
  my rule of thumb is this : never trust intelligence officers , retired or active . 
  and i doubt that vw wo n't share this with other german and dutch companies , if need be . 
  if this was a situation , where a 3rd party technicians & itists would n't have relations with intelligence services , then i could 've considered this just a petty move for vw to cover their tracks when they screw up ( like the co2 emissions ) , but this , involving ex-servicemen , with backdoors to other intelligence agencies ; this will turn very ugly . 
  which video ? 
  hm , now i see that i have so many downvotes . 
  what gives ? 
  rough translation : we do n't wan na get caught yet again in a scandal when we cheat . 
  but this will backfire as there is no such thing as an `` ex-serviceman '' .

  do you deny the fact that these types of lamentations like the one you 've used are horrendously disingenuous ipso facto ? 
  my bet is that someone from your family or circles of people you know , lamented or criticized something , after which spouted things like `` i wish we were protestants '' or `` i wish we were more like * ` them ' * '' , you heard it and took it for granted & you 're writing it here on the internet for any stranger to read it and take it as some sort of disadvantage ( and it is ! ) . 
  it 's disingenuous and you know why ? 
  because i 've heard exactly the same grunt some time ago that you wrote . 
  ( not on reddit ), 
  do n't bother , he 's living on stereotype positivism mumbled by his peers or family . 
  you want protestantism ? 
  go to norway . 
  the drinks are on me . 
  after we 've been stripped of them for peanuts , in the name of economic liberalisation ... yea . 
  i do n't like how things are evolving though . 
   more like szekely ` scuse me , joey , who ? 
  they talk hungarian , they claim sympathy with hungary ... they are hungarian , for anyone who understands . 
  they are separatists because they want exactly that , with budapest 's blessings . 
  no , childfree . 
   the funny thing is that you are doing exactly what uber does - argue with technicalities . 
  you mean you do n't want them to have a fair defense , kamerad ostdeutsch . 
   claiming that the people are `` self-employed '' and could not possibly be compared to taxi drivers for artificial reasons . 
  okay ... 
  when the co2 volkswagen emissions scandal occured , did volkswagen told the drivers that they should n't have driven as much ? 
  besides flipping off the european clientele , and compensating american clientele instead , volkswagen claimed & continues to claim ownership of its faulty products . 
  direct ownership , brand , ip - all of that , correct ? 
  uber , on the other hand , does n't own cars , drivers , car air freshener , factories , heavy machinery , trucks , tires ; nothing . 
  they 're a ' * tool * ' ( as adevland put it ) or an ' * application * ' .
