wow this is even worse than i imagined . 
   regional power   ukraine 's problem    we had no plans for any land grabs     but i like peace      our russian partners, 
  not a risk , more of a certainty . 
  russia also moved [ a lot ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/3m6wi8/russia_just_moved_massive_amount_of_armored/ ) of armor from abkhazia to rostov-on-don recently . 
  almost like ... this is a premeditated thing and they 're not really asylum seekers . 
  what do you even say to this ? 
  the faster the eu dissolves , the better . 
  how to set europe on fire with one stupid decision . 
  since brain drain has been one of the most destructive things that happened to poland and many other countries in the last 25 years , i 'd say most poles would be very happy . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9dnizvqwkm ) , footage of another ( ? ), 
  anti-immigration march in poland where they burned the eu flag . 
  for anyone here who is still in denial : 1 . 
  save [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/blankeurope.png ) on your computer . 
  open it in paint and color the countries the ussr destroyed and dehumanized with the paint bucket tool . 
  save as new file . 
  open the blank map again and color the countries the eu has snubbed and humiliated . 
  save it . 
  now compare the two . 
   frozen conflict it 's not frozen . 
  at what point do you start calling this an invasion ? 
  i 've heard this one before . 
   the only reason the west has n't intervened is because crimea was historically russian . 
  if the ukrainian mainland were to be attacked by russian `` rebels '' then there would be intervention . 
  also , [ new russian base in belarus on the way ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/09/19/world/europe/ap-eu-belarus-russian-base.html?_r=0 ) . 
  do n't worry , they 're not gon na use it to attack kiev . 
  because ... it would be so crazy if they did !, 
  \\  meanwhile on swedish side 30 counter-demonstrators show support for letting them in finland . 
  \\  [ mfw ] ( http://www.badtaxidermy.com/images/posts/63.jpg ), 
  this us escalating by the day now . 
  again , addressing immigration itself is now inevitable since it has been put off for so long . 
  had the eu been reasonable and had it taken just the bare minimum of common sense measures , it would n't have gotten this far . 
  the only result of refusing to take * any * measures is the guarantee that drastic ones will be taken eventually . 
  all russian monuments must be destroyed and the ground beneath them must be charred . 
   please russia !, 
  not to mention unbridled russian aggression and western europeans sniffing their own farts and turning a blind eye . 
  that is to say , the preludes to both world wars are in full swing again . 
  fuck the eu . 
  racially tickling croatia is a very bad idea . 
  edit : ~ ~ thousands ~ ~ hundreds have breached . 
  but it 's not looking good . 
  but ... preventing ww2 is what made ww2 inevitable . 
  refusing to defuse tensions by fighting smaller wars is what filled people with hatred and desperation and ensured calamity . 
  [ another stream ] ( http://www.rt.com/on-air/hungarian-border-police-refugees/ ) . 
  it 's looking worse than yesterday . 
  if its main goal happens to be criminal peacemongering and russophilia then yes . 
  the un is even more worthless than the eu , which is quite an achievement . 
  no one really cares what he says , not even himself . 
  bringing humvees with mounted machine guns to the border now . 
  damn !, 
  holy shit they captured a wanted terrorist at the border ? 
  they 're interrogating him right now . 
  apparently dozens of hungarian policemen injured . 
  what happens if one of them gets killed ? 
  they goaded them into moving forward only to teargas them . 
  damn it , hungary , why are you making me like you ? 
  edit : wait why the fuck are they chanting `` serbia '' now ? 
  something 's on fire now . 
  ca n't wait for this repulsive creature to go to hell . 
  border controls are an integral aspect of any state that claims to be civilized . 
  i back leaving the eu . 
  no way to stop this from happening . 
  says the only country where this happens . 
  it 's not like it happened in ' 90 - ' 92 . 
  there 's a huge amount of hatred towards russians in romania . 
  all it takes is one spark . 
  ca n't tell if trolling or not . 
  you do realize romania will inevitably enter any armed conflict in moldova , right ? 
   ai n't that a much more plausible explanation ? 
  for you , maybe . 
  the west did everything in its power to ensure a russian victory in ww2 . 
  the west did everything in its power to ensure 45 years of ussr , even cheering at the invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  even treating countries that were not part of it , like yugoslavia , with the same , almost divine , reverence . 
  the west did nothing to support the anti-communist resistance movements in the baltic states and romania . 
  the west did nothing to support anti-communist revolutions , even when the opportunity was practically handed to them , like in hungary . 
  even when said opportunity actually succeeded , like in romania . 
  the west continuously legitimized the ussr for 45 years by treating it like a legitimate entity . 
  the west would 've jumped at the opportunity to send troops to the nistru had it been anything other than a cesspit of russophilia . 
  what did they say right after russia invaded ukraine ? 
   we did n't know russia would just invade and start a war in europe ... again . 
  well now you do . 
  i wonder what pathetic excuses we 'll hear this time . 
  this is exactly the same as ukraine . 
  country gets destabilized by mass protests , motives become irrelevant once russia invades , nationalists rightfully wake up and war ensues . 
  if there 's still a single romanian in this thread who thinks the west is our friend , answer me this : what the fuck could they be waiting for right now ? 
  you would think that after allowing , even enabling , russia to invade ukraine , they would be eager to prove that they actually care about eastern europe . 
  you would think they would be eager to show that wo n't happen again . 
  * one fucking tank near bender * ? 
  anything ? 
  obama , is he even alive ? 
   we just did n't know !, 
  it 's not like ukraine happened last year and moldova is right next to it !, 
  disgusting to the point of physical nausea . 
   what would ukraine and moldova do without russia to blame all their ills on ? 
  we 'll find out soon . 
   we 'll just go ahead and side with stalin what could possibly go wrong . 
   east - west political divide is quite serious a divide made and maintained by he west , 100 % , by the way . 
  45 years of western europe frantically supporting russian colonialism in the east . 
  now just 25 years later they 're trying to force muslim colonialism . 
  fuck the eu . 
  well done , poland .
