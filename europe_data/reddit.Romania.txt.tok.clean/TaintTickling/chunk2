  when i was a child i could n't fathom how people were driven to war in 1914 ... 
  the war is not over . 
  it 's not a frozen conflict . 
  putin had the chance to freeze it for the last 6 months literally every day and the west would 've enthusiastically legitimized it within minutes . 
  i have no idea what he 's waiting for . 
  azov is probably holding on to shyrokyne too tightly . 
  they have n't given russia an inch in a long time now . 
  plus * a lot * of russian sympathizers have been arrested in kharkiv and odessa . 
  people have been protesting in moldova for about a week now and there are plans for a huge one tomorrow ( sunday ) . 
  it 's looking like another maidan . 
  russia could simultaneously pincer odessa from transnistria and crimea and pincer mariupol from crimea and donetsk . 
  also , the recent syrian deployment is not good news . 
  it does n't mean that russia will stop focusing on ukraine . 
  it means that russia fully prepared for and committed to waging war in foreign countries . 
  again , nobody invades a country as a publicity stunt , nobody invades a country to gain international sympathy . 
  people here claiming that it 's `` just to fight isis and look good '' are insane . 
  there 's obviously a strategic purpose it that will come in handy later ( soon ) . 
  [  mfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az5cglllt7c ), 
   and was opposed by russia and by most western powers this seems like a recurring theme . 
  just leave the eu already , jesus . 
  tumbling down ever faster that i expected . 
   and it seems europe does n't care ... 
  communism , stalin , russia , and the russian people in general have been literally synonymous with holy lord jesus christ in the west ever since ww2 . 
  any anti-russian * statement * is political suicide . 
  the only common denominator of politics west of the czech republic for the past 70 years has been russophilia . 
  by the way , the mess in the balkans got as bad as it did because russia supported serbia and even * rumors * of russian volunteers made western troops violate direct orders and back down . 
  and to everyone here wondering what will it take , nothing . 
  nothing will change their minds . 
  the west willingly , enthusiastically even , became stalin 's ally and friend * right as his crimes were peaking * . 
  right as he was in the process of devastating half a continent , in ways in which the plague , the mongol empire , the ottoman empire and even 2 atomic bombs , could not even hope to devastate ; the west giddily poured countless resources into russia and did everything they could to ensure russia 's victory . 
  france even sent volunteers to fight on the eastern front , think about that . 
  french soldiers to die for france ? 
  french soldiers to die for holy lord jesus stalin ? 
  indubitably !, 
  and this was quite possibly ** the most destructive event in known human history ** . 
  what could possible be the reason ? 
  [  mfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az5cglllt7c ), 
  curious why it 's been 3 hours with no comments . 
  seeing how isis is infiltrating europe as we speak , the title is uncomfortably literal . 
  squirming scum . 
  do you think the merkel sort of wants to end the eu ? 
  her behavior for the past year has been absurd . 
  this shit is straight out of 1914 . 
  reminder that 3 days ago the transnistrian parade allowed russia to discreetly mobilize lots of armor . 
  [ about that ... ] ( http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/isis-fighting-alongside-free-syrian-army-al-qaida/ ) not sure how reliable the source is , but it was my understanding that a lot of syrian rebels who were against assad as well as isis are now pretty much only against assad and neutral towards isis at the very least . 
   regional power   ukraine 's problem    we had no plans for any land grabs     our russian partners, 
  because they acted on those beliefs , unlike you . 
  hopefully we can keep it that way . 
  currently no . 
  it * was * a triumph . 
  ask your average indonesian , he 'll tell you . 
  30 years of suharto were sweet perfume compared to what china , vietnam , korea and cambodia went through . 
   i am a communist . 
  do you want me dead , too ? 
  i mean if you start that fifth column shit again ... 
  had it been done to stop jaywalking or public urination i would 've probably said no . 
  but seeing how it was an anti-communist purge , 500,000 does n't sound too bad . 
  communist themselves would 've killed a comparable , or even greater , number of people . 
  source : history . 
  asian communists were/are particular vicious too , see mao , ho chi minh , the kims and pol pot . 
   you think the killing of 500,000 people in indonesia was a good thing ? 
  i do n't think the good-bad angle will give you any accurate understanding of what happened . 
  what is your argument exactly ? 
  when communists appear , people die . 
  this is a fact of life . 
   killing 500,000 people is so bad , they should 've let the communists do it . 
  a great example of the implacable triumph men are capable of when they drop all pretensions . 
  i 've seen it . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  since the deciding factor in literally all empires ' , nations ' and peoples ' fates has been , is , and always will be war ; raw military dictatorship is objectively the best governing strategy to ensure national survival and prosperity . 
  everything you 've read about in history books that does not immediately relate to war , trade , diplomacy , technology , they would all be dust in the wind without a strong military backbone . 
  i believe this was the fatal mistake of the 20th century . 
  trying to talk , to understand , to reason , to empathize , to forgive , to philosophize , to `` be better '' , to flutter inane bits of paper like a moron , in the face of impending , physical doom . 
   but where has military dictatorship ever succeeded nowadays it would never work today people would - [ indonesia in 1965-1966 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indonesian_killings_of_1965%e2%80%9366 ) . 
  that 's right , it only took ** one year ** for a country most of you ca n't even find on a map , to solve the problem of communism . 
  how much time and resources did germany , spain , romania , finland , the baltic states throw down the drain after the first world war trying to stamp out communism ? 
  how many years of speeches , lectures , printing pamphlets , making posters , spying , compiling files , sabotaging , singing stupid songs , drawing stupid symbols , cropping ideologies together , making theories , squirming in and out of alliances ; * all for nothing * ? 
  the army on the loose for one year , that 's it . 
  that 's all it took indonesia to avoid the calamity of communism . 
  and this was n't just a couple of skirmishes , hundreds of thousands of people were killed . 
  and this was the mid 60s , so the fifth column was more than just peasants and miners . 
  and the same goes for international affairs . 
  if russia was invaded in 1919 , like hungary , there would n't have been a second world war . 
  a very despicable creature once said that all political power comes out of the barrel of a gun . 
  and he is right . 
  greater apathy , cowardice and russophilia . 
  excellent rebuttal . 
  all my statements have been proven false . 
   it 's only paradez reminder that the invasion of the ukrainian mainland was `` disguised '' as a military exercise . 
  the exercise was even planned a year before , prompting countless useful idiots to dismiss any fear of invasion `` too crazy '' . 
  believe whatever you want to believe . 
  the invasion of the ukrainian mainland started with a `` military exercise '' next to the border too . 
  [ soon . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gflyktyffrs ), 
  the war in ukraine started for less . 
   so , what do you suggest exactly ? 
  ethnic cleansing ? 
  mass repressions ? 
  yes , the russian and their sympathizers must be judged according to their own ways . 
   how european of you i 'm actually anti-eu , anti-democracy and anti-nato ( purely because it 's completely useless ) .
