  oh no i do n't doubt that things might happen there very soon . 
  i asked where have you been living in response to you saying you hope no one will cheer deaths on any side . 
  like , i do n't know how many people are consciously aware of this , but racial hatred is peaking in europe right now . 
  i do n't think it 's ever been this high and this widespread since the 30s and 40s . 
   szekler land declared independence and romania went to war with hungary i hope that no one would cheer deaths on any side . 
  where have you been living ? 
  this is a prime example of cognitive dissonance . 
  russians have been occupying moldova , among other territories , for `` almost '' 200 years now . 
  their foreign policy has been based on unapologetic war and genocide for ages now . 
  they 're waging war in europe as we speak . 
  but let 's be nice to them guys . 
  do n't be icky !, 
  let 's just ... ummm fight back pragmatically ? 
  it 's not like there 's a blood feud between us and russians . 
  let 's not * praise * war and destruction . 
  we could even try doing it a bit more dispassionately too !,

  it would be outstanding for romania to deal the first blow but unfortunately no one will do anything until the war spreads to odessa . 
  you 're citing a russian official saying the same thing .

  the most important parts :  kiev-ul vrea sa ii ia ostatici pe cei 200.000 de rusi care locuiesc in transnistria . 
  kiev wants to take the 200 000 russians living in transnistria hostage . 
  restarting the transnistrian military conflict could bring allied ( nato ) troops to the nistru . 
  ** restarting hostilities in the region will inevitably lead to a ferm response from moscow . 
  both disgusting and unsurprising . 
  [ another source ] ( http://fortruss.blogspot.ro/2015/06/russia-deploys-special-operations.html ) confirms they 've been * deployed * . 
  transnistria is landlocked ... and supposedly blocked to russian military . 
  are they actually reporting this themselves so people do n't think anything of it ?

  preemptive strike against worthless comments : yes , i am well aware that transnistria is basically a russian base and that the freaks in charge have wanted to be part of russia for quite some time . 
  however , due to the ongoing war in ukraine , the annexation of crimea , the upcoming russian offensive , the recent transnistrian blockade and the fact that no one is opposing russia ; i can assure you that statements like this are now indicative of impending war . 
  not really . 
  just in time , in fact . 
  no , you 're much worse . 
  you really are a disgusting person , are n't you ? 
  i was referring to the aforementioned half of europe that russians invaded and destroyed before during and after the war , many of those countries were invaded by hitler as well . 
  how exactly would you say they brought it upon themselves ? 
  let 's not even mention that fact that russia invaded finland , the baltic states and romania * before * operation barbarossa . 
  is this another russian distortion of history ? 
  anyone notable , like a military official ? 
  and most importantly , anyone not dangerous and/or insane that should 've been banned years ago ? 
  so that the banning would actually be seen as a measure taken in response to them starting a war in europe ( again ) rather than playing catchup and doing something they should 've done ages ago ? 
  muscovite tax collectors = / = grand duchy of moscow grand duchy of moscow = / = russian empire russian empire = / = ussr ussr = / = russia yeah ok . 
  it 's tremendously disgraceful that russia is the first to blacklist eu politicians rather than the other way around . 
  russia is currently waging war in europe again . 
  russia , the most desperately aggressive state that has ever attacked europe . 
  the state that has single-handedly ruined half of the continent in just 45 years . 
  something neither the mongols , nor the ottomans , nor even the plague achieved . 
  and * they * are the ones triumphantly blacklisting european politicians - that have been running around like chickens with their heads cut off for the past year throwing appeasement after appeasement after appeasement after appeasement after appeasement at them - while their hardware and troops are pouring keep pouring into ukraine as we speak . 
  how should the world interpret this ? 
  edit : disregard the first sentence ? 
   especially from the people who are normally quite loud about their disaproval of shady military business . 
  pacifism in europe is nothing more than kissing russia 's ass through the thinnest of handkerchiefs . 
  \\  i fail to see a genuine act of aggression i hope russia brings its non-aggression to your doorstep soon . 
  this kind of argument only gets invoked whenever it comes to countering russian aggression and is never invoked in regard to russian aggression itself . 
  kind of peculiar , no ? 
   why not offer the russians russians have been offered more than enough in the past couple of centuries .

  and this too : http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150526/1022568728.html#ixzz3bha3o51j, 
  maybe they know something you do n't ? 
  those definitions are quite old though . 
  you may have been right 20 years ago , but those words have since trickled into colloquial use . 
  i guess * self-absorbed * may still preferable to * solipsist * when describing something trite like a teenager 's way of thinking or whatever , but definitely not when it comes to a nation-wide phenomenon of institutionalized selfishness that is being pushed further and further day in and day out . 
  it 's probably hard for someone not from a former communist country to understand . 
   is the philosophical idea that only one 's own mind is sure to exist . 
  look , i 've had countless conversations with people where the only idea they were expressing was `` other people are worthless by default and i will never consider them when making any decisions simply because they 're not me '' .
