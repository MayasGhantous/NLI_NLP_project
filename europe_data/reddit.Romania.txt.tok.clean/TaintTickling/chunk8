  free for all !, 
  prove the paranoid whackjob wrong !, 
  hit me with those links !, 
   your entire argument is that because we have n't started an *** offensive war *** against russia , nato does n't exist . 
  you are , quite simply , stupid . 
  nice word twisting , mate !, 
  it 's not like i specifically said * in response to a single russian land grab or massacre * just now . 
  the konigsberg atrocity along with * every single post-war massacre russians ever did in europe * , hungary in ' 56 , czechoslovakia in ' 68 , military aggression against the baltic states after the ussr collapsed , the transnistrian war , various abominations in the caucasus , 2 planes full of western civilians knocked down , and * ukraine right now * . 
  since neither of these areas are russia , western military aggression could have only been interpreted as an offensive war by 2 categories of people - russians and their lapdogs , i.e. 
  you . 
  you brought the ussr up , not me . 
  also , yes !, 
  it was the * warsaw pact * !, 
  not the ussr . 
  it 's not like there was a literal wall in berlin and the eastern half was under ussr control . 
  not that it would invalidate anything i 've said so far but again , your russophilia is showing . 
  you other point is hilarious too . 
  and several people have said something similar to me whenever i said nato does n't exist . 
   oh tainttickling nobody can prove you wrong since you 're crazy and there 's no evidence that would satisfy you !, 
  let 's see , can your provide a single example of a single western soldier receiving and following an order to fire a single ballistic projectile in the direction of a single russian soldier in response to a single russian land grab or massacre in the past 70 years ? 
  there have been plenty of those , should n't be too difficult . 
  i mean outside the handful of cases of mistaken identity in korea and vietnam where a few planes got shot down , and no border incidents where someone dropped a grenade or whatever . 
   ah but said land grabs and massacres had nothing to with nato my friend xdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd carefully read [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3oscya/thousands_of_iranian_troops_are_teaming_up_with/cw0hc2r ) again . 
  the ussr extended to berlin . 
  why would stalin or any of his successors attack france or britain ? 
  the french and the british were his best allies and friends plus france and britain stopped being geopolitically relevant after the war . 
  resorting to pointless sarcasm is usually a concession , by the way . 
  read about what ? 
  western russophilia and the dozens of russian territorial gains , massacres and triumphant victories it enabled ? 
  western leaders refusing to act when russia invaded georgia , ukraine or syria has nothing to do with nato and everything to do with their own cowardice . 
  cowardice which they will not be able to shake when push comes to shove . 
  you seem to be under the false assumption that nato is this ethereal , cosmic entity that automatically materializes out of thin air and automatically starts commanding troops in the event of a russian attack independent from any western leaders ' characters , independent from any western narrative or track record , and most importantly independent from the pestilent russophilia that has been the cornerstone of western foreign policy since 1945 . 
  you 're going out on a limb even if you think that western troops would obey any orders to engage russian troops . 
  at least this much has been proven in the balkans . 
  assad asked but he stopped representing the vast majority of syria a long time ago . 
  people do n't depend on papers . 
  papers depend on people . 
  if somebody not only does nothing but is visibly terrified of even saying anything whenever russia invades a country - and not out of diplomatic considerations but out of pure fear - you ca n't expect that somebody to undergo a sudden personality change and start ordering counterattacks when russia crosses the nato border . 
  your phrasing is so cute . 
  russia did not * stage an intervention * , they * invaded * . 
  and they did not do it alongside iran , iran is doing it alongside russia . 
  this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  how do you expect anyone to believe that nato is `` bound by treaty '' to oppose anyone , especially russia , when you 're literally too scared to call a russian invasion a russian invasion . 
  well , * another * russian invasion , how many months did it take the west to finally call the war in ukraine a war ? 
  how many times do you think the baltic states ' entire population could be killed by russia in that time frame ? 
  yes . 
  so russia invading a country is automatically a green light for literally anyone else to invade as well ? 
  how can anyone still believe in the nato charade when westerners are scared to death of looking at russia without their permission and * the idea * of * maybe * knocking down an aircraft or two in syria ? 
   we treat russia as if it were holy lord jesus christ but once they cross the undefended and unenforceable nato border , it 's on !, 
  because ... it says so on a piece of paper . 
  merkel is working in perfect harmony with the eu . 
  the eu is a criminal organization designed from the start to stifle europe . 
  so far it has kept the western half disarmed , out of any wars , and off the international stage . 
  it has kept the eastern half poor , corrupt and submissive . 
  it has allowed russia to invade whoever they want , whenever they want . 
  it has lulled almost the entire continent into a false sense of security with the absurd charade of nato , and tons of bullshit about `` european values '' and `` progress '' . 
  the immigration disaster is a logical step to take considering the eu directives . 
   closing bosphorus to russia would basically be an act of war yes that 's the point !, 
  those wars were fought against koreans and vietnamese , not russians . 
  the handful of jets shot down were almost certainly cases of mistaken identity . 
  the cold war had 0 instances of a western power knowingly engaging a single russian solider or vehicle . 
  russophilia has been the * only * consistent aspect of western foreign policy for the last 70 years . 
  why has the bosphorus not been closed to russian vessels yet ? 
  edit : ** why has the bosphorus not been closed to russian vessels yet ? 
  ** how the fuck do you expect me or anyone who is not completely brain-dead to believe that nato will lift a single finger for me or anyone in eastern europe when it ca n't even impose itself *** on a fucking nato member *** and make it take a non-combative measure during peacetime ? 
  westerners are the weakest human beings that have ever lived . 
  the third time they 've `` pulled them back '' . 
   russia gets praised so jubilantly for invading another country ( again ) it would make old testament god puke his guts out what the fuck is going on ? 
  the transnistrian war was won by romania . 
  russia did not accomplish their main objective , crossing the nistru river and occupying moldova . 
  and yes , since relations with russia is the main subject of this thread , that 's what i was referring to . 
  incidentally , [ the only romanian-american battle ever fought was also decidedly won by romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tidal_wave ) . 
  last romanian-russian war : 1990-1992 last us-russian war : ... first us-russian war : ... any us-russian wars : ... 
  fuck the eu . 
  continuing to legitimize russia and their war in ukraine by meeting with putin . 
  unreal . 
  let 's gloss over 1945-1990 and ask what did britain , germany and france did to counter russian aggression after 1990 , just the last 25 years ? 
  romania/moldova successfully stopped russian troops from crossing the nistru in 90-92 by killing hundreds of them . 
  what did britain , germany and france do ? 
  by the way , russian foreign ministry said they 're ready to invade iraq `` if they ask for their help '' . 
   the 80s called, 
  great , western europe has been nothing but dead weight for quite some time . 
  found these on / pol / , all uploaded today . 
  apparently footage of the aftermath . 
  will delete if turns out to be something else ( earlier footage filmed after american raids or something ) . 
  warning : dead bodies .

  looks like moldova/transnistria is finally getting hot too . 
  [ protesters said they 'll storm the parliament building if they keep getting ignored . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mzr1z/prorussian_protesters_in_moldova_threaten_to/ ) the ukrainian war is also * not * frozen . 
  and i ca n't be the only one thinking that the caucasus will not stand idle as russia bombs syria . 
  continue to support russia 's every move , just like they 've always done for the past 70 years . 
  does anyone else feel like france has always been disgustingly fond of russia ? 
  i mean above and beyond the usual western russophilia . 
  just me ? 
  currently romania has no allies . 
  historically , hitler was probably the best one . 
  http://www.realitatea.md/noi-indemnuri-la-separatism--comunistii-din-balti-vor-autonomie-si-cheama-cetatenii-la-miting--video-_21032.html also [ moldova has banned russian media outlets ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/36r90l/he_government_of_moldova_has_agreed_to_ban_the/ ) , [ russian access to moldova and transnistria has been blocked ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36qfov/ukrainian_parliament_votes_to_terminate_several/ ) and i 've read something about concern in latgale . 
  plus [ ongoing battles just outside mariupol ] ( https://twitter.com/marqs__/status/601443282699177986 ) and an explosion at a checkpoint of the city itself . 
  edit : apparently moldova has n't banned russian media outlets ?
