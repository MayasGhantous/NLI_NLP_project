there 's this urban legend that after the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia , when ceausescu gave the finger to the russians , the tried to invade romania from moldova , but the tanks were stopped by a huge laser weapon designed by henri coand\u0103 , which melted the tanks . 
  the story was pushed by the propaganda machine , because people at the time were scared shitless by the possibility of a russian invasion and was based on `` eye witness accounts '' . 
  despite the fact that the story is incredibly ridiculous because : 1 . 
  there is no evidence of such a weapon ever existing , let alone the incredibly backwards romanian army at the time being in possession of one ; 2 . 
  if such a weapon existed and was indeed secret , there is no way the highly censored media at the time would have been able to write anything about it ; 3 . 
  if this really had happened , you would expect people living in villages on the other side of the prut river , in moldova , to have witnessed it as well . 
  ask any old moldovan who has lived in that area about this and they have no idea what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  despite these facts , there are many people who actually believe this happened and will tell you the story as though it was a known historical fact . 
   and they could check for infectious diseases like leprosy do n't worry , we have the [ last leper colony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tichile\u0219ti,_tulcea ) in europe . 
   or tuberculosis yeah , while tuberculosis has been all but eliminated from the civilized part of europe , romania still deals with like 15.000 cases annually . 
  the us still is a wet dream for most romanians , when i returned from the us a few years ago i was like a rockstar for a couple of months , but the first question everyone asked me was `` why the fuck did you return ? '' . 
  i had a hard time explaining them the us is n't like in the movies . 
  it is irrelevant how many women have been raped by italian nationals , although it has been proven time and time again that the crime rate is higher among immigrants than nationals . 
  however , this is still beyond the point . 
  the point is that these people are supposed to come here for security and peace , not to rape women . 
  reality is that refugees are only a small part of the people coming in , for most of them we have no idea who the fuck they are or what they were doing in their life . 
  we have no idea if a guy is simply a college student running from war or an isis fighter who beheaded dozens of people . 
  that 's the fucking point !, 
  it kind of makes me angry , if as a citizen you break some stupid law that you never agreed to ( like weed being illegal ) , you get fined or go to to jail , but as a government , if you break international laws that you actually signed and agreed to , not much happens . 
  is it even legal to build a fence between two schengen countries ? 
  let 's face it , portugal atm is n't much different from eastern europe , at least economically . 
   i do n't even know what the hell are they doing ... 
  i do n't think the croats themselves know what the fuck they 're doing . 
  at this point , they seem incapable of governing their own fucking country , they went full retard after just two days of migrants entering their country . 
  romania : 1940 - 2000, 
  because they 're trying to force the quotas , merkel acts like she fucking owns europe , she needs to be shown the finger . 
  romania 's accession to schengen has mainly been blocked by germany , for illegitimate reasons , now the same germany is trying to force us to take in their refugees , we would be idiots not to tell them to go fuck themselves . 
  the quotas are n't even really realistic , at first they asked us to take 1785 refugees , which romania accepted , now they 're talking about 6000 , that 's when we told them to go fuck themselves . 
  who know , maybe next year we 're going to be asked to take in 60.000 , so no , please shove your quotas up your ass . 
   do you think europe should n't take in any refugees in the first place ? 
  i think europe should take in refugees , but real ones , who can prove they are in immediate danger in their home country and should be kept in third safe countries while their asylum requests are reviewed . 
  no more skipping lines , strolling through borders and germoney , germoney !, 
  chants . 
  if these refugees want to be treated like humans , they must first learn to behave like humans , be thankful for the help they receive and not act fucking entitled in countries that have zero obligations towards their sorry asses . 
  when refugees from eastern ukraine were taken into romania , they acted very humble and were very thankful , nobody had any problem with them . 
  if all these `` syrians '' ( i quoted the word syrians because only 20 % are actually syrians ) learned to be humble and thankful for the help they receive and not act like animals , i think less people would be against taking them in . 
  that 's actually great news , what threat , nobody gives a shit other than leftist dickheads . 
   will end up costing us a fortune . 
  `` a fortune '' is an understatement in this case . 
  they already lost $ 25 billion in shares and they were n't even fined yet . 
  the sad part is that in the end , people working for vw and the customers will have to foot the bill . 
  elon musk wants to send 1 million people to mars , this is a great opportunity to solve the migrant crisis . 
   i did know tallinn is your capital !, 
  tallinn is n't the capital of lithuania . 
  welcome to the club , the mayor of bucharest is already dropping the soap in jail . 
  rather than take in 2000 entitled motherfuckers , they could help 2000 slovakian homeless . 
   so you get fined , as per the rules . 
  the fine would be like 1.74 million euros , which honestly , is shit , compared with the cost of actually integrating the asylum seekers ( not just integrating them ) . 
  even if the fine would be more , it would still be worth it , just to avoid all the rapists and terrorists . 
   it was the eus biggest mistake to take almost entire eastern europe as economic refugees after the fall of the soviet union . 
  yeah , because the whole of eastern europe is empty right now , give me a break . 
  take a look at the numbers for asylum seekers , nothing since wwii compares to today 's situation . 
   we pumped billions into your countries to get them to western standards . 
  haha , western standards , you make me laugh . 
  what western standards , go to poland , hungary , romania , experience the western standards for yourself , especially in villages . 
   we pumped billions those billions were n't fucking charity , almost every single time the eu pumps billion into some big project , it 's going to be western companies building/maintaining those projects , so the profits return to western europe anyway . 
   responsibilities as members of the eu to do the same where does it say we need to accept arbitrary migrant quotas ? 
  we never signed up for that when we joined the eu , so basically , you can shove your quotas up your ass . 
   humans in desperate need these * people desperate in need * look like their entitled to live in germany , not hungary or romania . 
  i always see * refugees * chanting germoney , germoney ! , never hungary , poland , romania etc. 
  yeah , because western countries can opt out of things like the eurozone and schengen , but we can opt out from taking merkel 's and juncker 's migrants . 
  they 're not eu citizens , merkel invited them here , she can have all of them if she wants , why force other countries to take them ? 
  bunch of retards , luckly they do n't have much power . 
  yeah , they want to go to syria to get training so they can fuck up europe afterwards . 
  syria is perfect to train aspiring jihadis to wreak havoc in peaceful countries in europe . 
  i can only imagine how many isis fighters are inside the eu right now . 
  thanks merkel !, 
   just shows that romania still has a long way towards being a civilized country . 
  but some day you will get there . 
  atm , i see western countries wanting to adopt immigration policies similar to that of romania . 
  our immigration policy would be considered extremely right wing by western european standards , but of course , no one rants about it because not that many people immigrate to romania . 
  but the point is , if you are n't an eu citizen ( + norway , iceland , switzerland ) or moldovan , immigrating to romania is a bureaucratic nightmare . 
  we are always taken by surprise , the british were taken by surprise by the polish immigrants , everyone was taken by surprise by the financial crisis , everyone was taken by surprise by hordes of migrants coming in after gaddafi was killed , everyone was taken by surprise when russia went batshit insane last year . 
  at this point , i would n't be surprised if we would be taken by surprise by a giant fucking asteroid heading towards earth . 
  end of the story , humanity was taken `` by surprise '' , just like the dinosaurs . 
   sweden : $ 0 ( ** since you get it just 5 years after showing up in the country ** ) but is n't it like that with most countries ? 
  you can get us citizenship even faster ( 3 years i believe , 2 if you get married with a us citizen ) , but of course you have to be a legal immigrant , have your residence permit and shit up to date . 
  in romania we like to troll foreigners who want citizenship , i remember some afghan woman being rejected because she did n't know what was the name of stephen the great 's horse ( he of course had multiple horses so she had to guess which one the people making up the exam questions thought of ) . 
  of course it was held successfully , with the migrant crisis going on , i doubt many people even noticed or cared about some gay parade . 
  well , if you want schengen , you ca n't be like , `` oh ok , these migrants wo n't be staying here anyway , let 's let them illegally enter schengen . 
  it would be really sad if schengen would die because of these welfare leeches , but if westerners are too stupid to see them for what they really are , i guess it 's the only way . 
  nobody stay in austria , all people go to jermoney , pliz , pliz !, 
  great argument to break the law , imagine a bunch of mexicans trying to enter the us with no papers , saying `` nobody want to stay in texas , all people go to nyc , por favor ! '', 
   they 're broke and can barely eat . 
  no shit , then where are all those thousands of euros they each pay to smugglers coming from ? 
   with schengen you do not need to be a hungarian citizen to work in hungary . 
  that has nothing to do with schengen , but eu . 
  in theory any romanian can work in hungary without needing any special places , but in reality nobody does it , because no one wants to move to hungary and learn hungarian so they can make $ 330 per month instead of $ 220 . 
  also , the hungarian citizenship law is kind of retarded , any romanian who has some ancestor born in transylvania while it belonged to austria-hungary ( does n't even have to be hungarian ) is eligibile for hungarian citizenship , they only need to know some really basic hungarian to answer some retard proof questions and recite the oath . 
   send them gypsies disguised as syrian refugees somewhere like back the funny thing is that just yesterday i heard about migrants dressing up as gypsies to cross from hungary into austria and then germany . 
  the austrian border police thought they were gypsies from hungary and romania , so they let them through without checking their documents . 
   there are obviously embarrassing false friends oh , yeah , i know about those , like ** fiica ** means * daughter * in romanian and ** fica ** means * cunt * in italian , or ** pula ** means * jump * in portuguese and * cock * in romanian . 
  [ this portuguese song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-ktakcyke8 ) sounds extremely obscene in romanian . 
   everybody eats , shits and fucks not really a good example , cockroaches also eat , shit and fuck . 
  maybe , who cares , the road is useless anyway , since germoney and finland wo n't let us join schengen . 
  ok , so here are some examples of border towns : [ n\u0103dlac , romania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6fncceu.jpg ) - [ mak\u00f3 - hungary ] ( http://i.imgur.com/unwyrr0.jpg ) [ oravi\u021ba , romania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hslp1zv.jpg ) - [ bela crkva , serbia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n6ngt4a.jpg ) [ giurgiu , romania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1ywjpqz.jpg ) - [ ruse , bulgaria ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqkzzlv.jpg ) so , to answer your question , if we talk about romania , generally yeah , the border areas look relatively similar , the hungarian villages close to the border look a bit better , serbian villages look kind of the same , sometimes better , sometimes worse , bulgarian villages generally look worse , ukrainian villages worse and moldovan villages look like someone dropped a nuke over them . 
  also , most hungarians and serbs living close to the romanian border speak romanian , including border police and customs officials . 
  relevant username you got there buddy . 
  needs moar jihad . 
  i 've seen commenters here claiming syrians are culturally close to europe , seriously , wtf , does this seem similar to europe ?
