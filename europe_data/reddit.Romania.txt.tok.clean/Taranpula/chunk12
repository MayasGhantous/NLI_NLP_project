  where did you have the exchange ? 
  simple question : would they have asked a muslim artist to endorse israel ? 
  well , then these guys should go fuck themselves !, 
  gon na be honest here , moldova does n't have any truly spectacular sights or great places to visit , but the cheap booze and women alone are worth a trip . 
  the lgbt flag has six colors , this has only 3 . 
  anyway , i do n't see what your point is ? 
  no , my flair is a transylvanian flag . 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  as an outsider , it 's very hard for me to understand why to swedish politicians , media and public simply refuse to admit that their multiculturalism project is an embarrasing failure . 
  when a country turns from what was basically a paradise to the rape capital of the west ( south africa is the only country on earth that has more rapes per capita than sweden ) , you have a serious fucking problem . 
  there 's just so much hypocrisy , how can you treat the ethnicity of prisoners like a state secret and at the same time claim that multiculturalism is the best thing evaaaaar ? 
  if multiculturalism is so awesome , why not prove that people from non-european backgrounds are n't more likely to break the law ? 
  swedish media is probably retarded . 
  ugh , i think it has many different flavours , just like christianity . 
  there 's the two major ones everyone knows about , sunni and shi'a . 
  in romanian , the netherlands is called '' \u021a\u0103rile de jos '' . 
  if you say that , 4/5 people will have no idea what the fuck you 're talking about , but if you say `` olanda '' , everyone knows . 
  an even lesser known fact , is that the people/language are called neerlandezi/neerlandez \u0103 , but 99.9 % of people say olandezi/olandez \u0103 . 
  still , where the fuck are latvia and belarus ? 
  [ that shepherd is romanian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evnwohligig ), 
  ilan shor is mayor of orhei , renato usatii is mayor of balti , igor dodon is the leader of the biggest party ... but do n't worry , moldovans are n't the only ones who are mildly retarded , imagine that almost 60 % of romanians would want romania to unite with moldova . 
  i think the most expensive house in timisoara is probably around $ 600.000 euros , so $ 300.000 would probably buy you something pretty nice . 
  however , if i had that kind of money to invest into a house , i would build my own , it would feel like a terrible waste to invest that sort of money in a house built according to someone else 's taste . 
  trajan isone of the most important characters in our history , i 'm pretty sure there are more romanians who know about trajan than those who know about caesar . 
  well , it 's just like rich westerns wait for a maybach or some special edition ferrari or lamborghini , only romanians were waiting for a fucking dacia . 
  that 's a retarded way of thinking , a city is defined by the law , which varies from country to country , not by your personal opinion . 
  we must crush all those evil fascist homonazi geese at once !, 
   so , russians created their own ads for stuff that was impossible to buy . 
  the idea was that when people see foreign ads then they assume that it 's fake/propaganda like their own ads . 
  lol , never knew about that , we had tv ads in communist romania too , but at least they featured stuff you could actually buy ( if you were willing to wait in line for a few hours or , a few ... years , in case of a car . 
  if true , that was a pretty smart propaganda move by the soviets . 
  it 's not like their gdp is very big , though . 
  not really sure about that . 
  first , it 's highly unlikely that shor pocketed all the money . 
  secondly , there are quite a few people in moldova `` suspected '' of being billionaires ( although none confirmed by forbes ) , including gabriel stati , vlad plahotniuc , vlad filat and oleg voronin . 
  however , some sources claim that it 's highly unlikely anyone in moldova has a net worth of more than $ 100 million , however that 's hard to estimate in a country where basically no one made a fortune through honest , legitimate means . 
  whenever i think of russian traditional food , borscht comes to mind first , i keep forgetting it 's ukrainian . 
  m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 with cheese and sour cream - probably about 5 , 6 weeks ago . 
  well , they do n't count as people from other countries . 
  what do you mean , exactly ? 
  dislike : - nigel farage . 
  he often talks shit about romanians , mostly unprovoked . 
  he seems like a huge asshole . 
  she 's a crazy dumb bitch imo . 
  - david cameron . 
  the guy acts like he 's trying to turn the uk into a complete police state . 
  if he keeps it this way , he 'll probably join the authoritarian assholes club , with putin , erdogan , orban and lukashenko . 
  quite an asshole , nuff ' said !, 
  he 's such a clown !, 
  - all those swedish social democrats , they seem to always have their heads up their asses . 
  ** like ** - guy verhofstadt . 
  i do n't know a lot about the guy , but [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84tn0z4jqm ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m4hexu-tfg ) made me think he 's fucking awesome . 
  - i think montenegro is the most likely country to join next . 
  it has a per capita gdp lower than bulgaria but higher than serbia , it 's a very small country but with big tourism potential . 
  they do n't have any major problems or disputes afaik , so it 's not too difficult to see them join within the next 5 years . 
  - serbia comes second , but with them it 's a bit debatable . 
  they will probably need to sort out their shit with kosovo first . 
  they will also need to make a definitive pick between the eu and russia , but i think that in the end they will get over the fact that they were bombed by nato and choose the eu , for practical reasons ( because it 's a landlocked country , the eu is pretty close and russia quite far ) . 
  a realistic timeline would mean that they will probably join 5-10 years from now . 
  - albania and macedonia are probably next in line to join in the next 10-15 years , maybe even together with serbia if they get more serious about fulfilling the criteria . 
  - bosnia and kosovo might also join 15-20 years from now . 
  bosnia might join sooner , but kosovo is probably at least 20 years away . 
  - ukraine , moldova ca n't realistically expect to join in the next 20 years , both are poor as fuck and have serious problems with pro-russian separatists ( crimea , donbas , transnistria ) . 
  ** moldova ** might get to join the eu through the back door though , if it decides to unite with romania . 
  that 's pretty unlikely though , as most moldovan politicians say they want to focus on joining the eu first , then talk about uniting with romania . 
  however , in practice , uniting with romania would be a lot more realistic than joining the eu , since only romanians would be dumb enough to accept the poorest country in europe with all its problems . 
  ** ukraine ** has a lot of shit it needs to deal with before it can even hope of starting negotiations with the eu . 
  unlike moldova , they would n't have any chance to get in through the back door , they will need to do it the hard way and make sure to not slip back into russia 's sphere of influence ( which is a very real possibility , as it 's happened before ) . 
  - belarus , russia are extremely unlikely to join , at least in the foreseeable future , as they are already part of the eurasian customs union or whatever it 's called . 
  georgia and azerbaijan might eventually join , but not in the near future . 
  it says up to 12 years , that 's probably the maximum for attempted robbery . 
  in the real world , the prosecutors will probably drop the case or he will get a suspended sentence at worst ( at least , this is what would most likely happen in romania ) . 
  the english language , maybe ? 
  that 's just pure bs . 
  i think i was like 8 when i went to a nude beach for the first time . 
  yes , there were a bunch of naked grandmas with hanging tits and meat curtains but there were also hot 16-20 year olds . 
  if anything , it made me figure out that 16 year olds were more attractive than 60 year olds . 
  let 's be serious here , i never heard of a person who became asexual because they saw some naked old woman as children . 
  yup , there 's also `` fuck your mother 's cross '' . 
  there are many curses in romanian , most revolve a few main themes : - the person you are swearing at performing humiliating sex acts - the person 's mother performing humiliating sex acts - god , jesus , angels , saints , the devil performing sex acts on the person or his mother or vice versa . 
  - if it 's an object which breaks or does n't work properly , you usually curse at both the object and its maker ( i.e. 
  may i stick my dick in this computer and whoever made it ) . 
  - fictional characters who are very remotely related to the person ( i.e. 
  may i stick my dick in the doctor who refused to give your mom an abortion ) . 
  as you probably noted , `` dick '' , specifically `` my dick '' is a very important part of cursing in romanian and is probably used in like 80 % of curses . 
  even girls use it sometimes , despite the fact that it does n't make any sense for a girl to say `` my dick '' , but then again , it does n't make any sense to say `` may i stick my dick in this microwave oven ! '', 
  either . 
   there are children around , after all oh , we really need to protect our children from this shit , can you imagine a child seeing a grown man 's weenie ? 
  bet he will be traumatized for life , he 'll need psychological counselling , maybe even psychiatric medication . 
  seriously , what the hell is wrong with these people , we have nude beaches in romania as well , there are naked people and kids around , nobody gives a fuck . 
  if you do n't want your kid to see naked people on the beach , well , then do n't take your kid on the beach . 
  people need to understand nobody gives a flying shit about their fucking kids , that 's why they 're your kids , not mine . 
  ohh , so basically \u0431\u043b\u044f is mostly used to make yourself sound more intimidating , right ? 
  romanians and moldovans often encounter each other in the youtube comments section . 
  there 's two ways things can go : a. 
  it becomes a circlejerk about how the countries should unite . 
  it turns into an ugly argument where moldovans accuse romanians of being gypsies and slaves of the us and romanians accuse the moldovans of sucking russian dick and their women of being whores and not cleaning their vaginas . 
  btw , i never understood the curse '' \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u044f '' , do n't the two words mean the exact same thing ? 
  - go to hell sugi pula !, 
  - suck the dick du-te-n pizda m\u0103-tii - go back to your mother 's cunt futu-\u021bi mor\u021bii m\u0103-tii !,
