  haha , april fools ' , brits are already the fattest in europe . 
  barrack saddam hussein osama bin laden, 
  [ this shit 's missing !, 
  she can prosecute me any way she wants !, 
  well , judging by the way europe 's going , a more appropriate april 's fools would have included an isis flag and lots of burqas and hijabs . 
  we all know this will never happen though , / r/europe 's mods are too afraid of `` offending '' some certain people . 
  to be honest , i never thought romanian sounds like polish , but we do have a hell lot of accents so it 's possible one or two might sound like polish to a foreign person . 
  news reporters are trained to speak with no accent ( or standard romanian accent , however you like to call it ) because they have to be easily understood by everyone , and if they all spoke in their regional accent , people from other regions would make fun of them . 
  very few people speak in a standard accent in their day to day lives , and that includes news reporters . 
  btw , can you give some examples where you think it sounds like polish ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  big deal , i got beat up by the romanian gendarmerie once for telling one of them to go fuck his mom . 
  well , i agree adblock is a form of extortion , but that 's why i use ublock , which is basically adblock without the bullshit . 
  i do n't agree with you on the revenue part . 
  if your site produces original , quality content , there are always ways to make money . 
  you just need to start thinking outside the box . 
  there are things like patreon , affiliate programs , or you can sell your ad space directly , not through ad networks . 
  sure , this is much more difficult to do than simply making an account on an ad network and copy paste some javascript on your pages . 
   but they have to realize that noone owes them free content . 
  well , that 's true , but since there 's so much free content on the web , nobody gives a shit . 
  you have to adapt or die , the internet is a jungle , it always was . 
  yeah , that 's exactly what happens . 
  in romania we also have this shit - guy goes to germany , buys a used bmw x5 for like $ 6000 , registers it in bulgaria because he ca n't afford the romanian tax , does n't travel with it very much because gas is expensive , repairs it at shady services with unofficial spare parts , but `` hey , look at me , i have a bmw x5 ! '' . 
  i personally know a guy who bought a fucking porsche and kept it abandoned in a parking lot for like a year , because he could n't afford the taxes for it . 
  there are lots of them , it really depends on each individual person , some even start a sentence in romanian and finish it in russian . 
  ** some extremely common examples of russian words are : ** * caroce * - means something like `` basically '' , in romanian it would be `` pe scurt '' . 
  it comes from the russian \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435 . 
  * prosta * - means `` simply '' , a romanian way of saying it would be `` pur \u0219i simplu '' . 
  comes from the russian \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e . 
  * costum sportiv * - means `` tracksuit '' , in romanian it 's `` trening '' , the moldovan version is a literal translation of \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u043c . 
  * fotosesie * - means photo shoot , in romanian it would be '' \u0219edin\u021b\u0103 foto '' . 
  ** non-existant grammar constructions ** * a se primi * - i do n't think there 's an english equivalent for this , but the romanian equivalent would be `` a ie\u0219i '' . 
  for example , one guy goes to a job interview and afterwards his friend asks him `` cum s-a primit ? 
  '' , something like `` how did it go '' , or `` pozele nu prea s-au primit '' ( the photos did n't look so great ) . 
  in romanian , a primi means to receive , there 's no reflexive form of this verb , thus `` a se primi '' does not exist . 
  * a regula * - they use it to mean `` to set ( something ) '' . 
  in romanian it would be `` a regla '' , `` a regula '' is basically a lighter version of `` to fuck '' . 
  so when a moldovan says `` m\u0103 duc s\u0103 regulez televizorul '' ( i 'm going to set up the tv ) , a romanian understands the dude wants to have sex with the tv . 
  and many , many more ... 
  no , invasive ads are destroying the internet . 
  i 'm speaking as a website owner myself , but first and foremost i 'm a user . 
  if ads were n't used to distribute malware , track users and obstruct content , i doubt many people would use something like adblock . 
  but as long as ads are violating people 's privacy , pose a security risk and annoy the hell out of visitors and use up bandwidth , people will find ways to block them , wether through something like adblock , or , in the worst case scenario just simply blocking the advertisers ' ips . 
   hmm , if they can escape with stolen cars so easily then that means the police in moldova is completely useless . 
  uh , [ you do n't say ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrbwjq7uk8 ) . 
  the ones who are smarter than this distinctive young lady are mostly corrupt . 
  i doubt it 's very difficult to register a stolen car in moldova . 
  well , this can be a little deceiving , because moldovans do like their cars a lot . 
  i know this is also the case for romanians , but in the case of moldova it 's much more extreme . 
  there are more than a few moldovans who have cars worth more than their house . 
  there are also many stolen cars , especially rented from western european countries and never returned or bought on leasings which were never paid back . 
  well , i 'm not sure , the dna is overworked as it is , i do n't know if bringing an entire batch of politicians they know nothing about under their jurisdiction would be a good idea . 
  the dna nowadays is mostly relying on convicted politicians snitching on other politicians . 
  while there are many ties between romanian and moldovan politicians , this is mostly limited to moldova 's pro-eu camp . 
  most of the pro-russian camp would be a big question mark for romanian prosecutors . 
   but given ukraine 's recent experience i ca n't help but feel if you tried there might be a totally not affiliated with russia independent democratic republic of eastern moldova pop up . 
  there already is , it 's called transnistria . 
  i would n't say so , the average rent in chisinau is about the same as the average wage . 
  yup , idiots even made camming illegal , it is one of the very few businesses which are actually profitable in moldova . 
  depends on the country , for example the case of adrian n\u0103stase , former romanian pm and former convict ( for corruption ) , just one of his houses is the size of a small airport - [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vm7quv7.jpg ) . 
  there are few romanian businessmen who could afford such a house . 
  you do realize that the money is n't even in moldova anymore , right ? 
  they 're most likely sitting in bank accounts in some tax havens that are really hard to track . 
  yeah , one of the few good things the commies did was to bring the literacy rate to over 99 % . 
  it 's actually been going down since the collapse of communism , our literacy rate is like 98 % now , but those 2 % are just the people who are completely illiterate , but there are many more who are functionally illiterate ( they read slowly , ca n't write properly , grammar rules are a complete mistery to them etc. ) . 
  this is in the case of romania , in the case of moldova it 's much , much worse . 
  with russian being the official language during the ussr , the romanian language has been completely butchered by the introduction of romanised russian words , and grammar constructions that do not exist or are being used improperly . 
  [ tbh , it 's not like moldova was an advanced country before the ussr either .

  tbh , i did lose a few lottery tickets in the past , but they all had like one or two numbers , fortunately . 
  a lottery ticket costs like 5 lei , it 's very likely some people just buy them due to a momentary impulse , then quickly forget about them because of the extremely unlikely odds of actually winning . 
  if we count all the lost opportunities due to corruption and bureaucracy , i 'd bet for romania the cost would be at the very least $ 100 billion per year . 
  seriously ? 
  did you just search / r/europe for `` albania '' to find this ancient thread ? 
  that idea is pretty stupid from a strategical point of view as well . 
  why build a huge bomb when you can make many that have a lower yield but can cause more destruction due to the ability of hitting multiple targets at once ? 
  anyway , it 's complete nonsense , even if ww3 starts , i doubt major powers would be willing to nuke anyone , only a failed nuclear state like pakistan might be willing to pull the trigger . 
  a terrorist attack would cost even more . 
  however , i think heightened security measures should be sufficient . 
  if authorities are competent , these types of attacks could be avoided , unfortunately they are n't very competent , as it has been proven . 
  i do n't work for such an organization because there simply is n't one , also the terror threat in my country is low , because we do n't have many muslims . 
  i was against these types of marches from the very start , it 's not like terrorists give a fuck about them , even worse , they could see them as good potential to strike again . 
  what good did that #jesuischarlie bullshit do ? 
  a war is fought with soldiers , not protest marches and social media hashtags . 
  if all these people want to do something good for their country , they should form volunteer organisations that look for potential terrorists and report them to the authorities . 
  this sounds a lot like romania , except for the part with the migrants . 
  yeah , i do , but it 's the best option there is , unless you want to abstain completely from vaginal sex or sterilize yourself . 
  except shit like this happen all the time on the internet , except people do n't get `` outraged '' 99.99 % of the time . 
  have you been living under a rock ? 
  that 's good , shit like this should be on prescription only anyways , it 's not like it 's fucking candy . 
  if you do n't want to get pregnant , you 're in luck , there 's this wonderful affordable invention called a condom . 
  it protects against unwanted pregnancies and , as an added bonus , it also protects against many stds . 
  if you do n't want to use a condom , well , then it means you like adrenaline , so assume the god damn risk that comes with it !, 
  had it been a random palestinian woman tweeting about asking a random israeli guy `` why does israel kill innocent palestinian children ? '', 
  i 'm sure there would n't have been any outrage whatsoever , let alone an arrest . 
  heck , she might have even won a prize of some kind from some retarded leftist ngo . 
  so please , save your `` bonafide hate crime '' hypocritical bullshit for yourself . 
   ffs , remember what happened after the paris attack ? 
  all this belgium is a failed state , brussels is a hell hole and bombing molenbeek bullshit ? 
  tbh , the current situation does n't make belgium look any better .
