  if said car has foreign license plates , you 're pretty much fucked . 
   is she a prostitute or some kind of slave ? 
  both . 
   in this case , would n't they want foreigners who look like they have money trying to talk to these girls to separate them from their money ? 
  they do . 
  but you might not expect the woman to be a prostitute and the traffickers might try extorting you for far more money than you intend paying . 
  they are also pretty convincing , because , you know , they have guns . 
  you might just run into [ these guys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0z9zxl3.jpg ) , who will probably want to part you from your car . 
  i do n't know , as a romanian i was able to drive in the us for 90 days , after that i had to get a us driving license which was like $ 30 or something ( did n't need it though ) . 
  it 's funny because it took me like only two weeks and around # 20 or something like that to exchange my romanian license for a british one . 
  in romania , the driving school + medical tests + theoretical and driving tests cost around $ 300 - $ 350 in total . 
   license test fees are around 200-300 euros here . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  in romania the test fee is like $ 15 , it 's the actual driving courses that cost money ( $ 250 - $ 300 , depending on the school ) . 
  i think something was lost in translation - in romania it 's also illegal to drive a car with dirty license plates , the actual car can be full of shit , it does n't matter as long as the license plates are clean , thus visible . 
  well , i agree , if we were n't a bunch of stupid kids who thought it would be a good idea to drive a range rover into transnistria , maybe we would n't have attracted any attention and my experience would have been different . 
  still , this does n't change the fact that i 've been to moldova proper quite a few times and never faced such problems . 
   but `` traffiker '' part sounds like bs still human trafficking is a problem in all of moldova , not just transnistria , it 's just that in transnistria the `` state '' does n't do shit about it because they 're hand in hand with the traffickers , so they are way more overt in transnistria than they are in moldova . 
  if you see a hot , nicely dressed young woman in transnistria , chances are she belongs to a trafficker . 
  personal experience , i 've been there . 
  not going back though , i 'm allergic to gopniks who point guns at me . 
  i 'm not sure about this , on one hand i support the free internet , but on the other , i like my privacy . 
  it does n't really matter , i 've been using a vpn for quite some time now and it 's definitely worth the ~ $ 50 per year , no doubts about it . 
  did you go through ? 
  were you driving an expensive car ? 
  if yes , consider yourself lucky if you still have it ... 
   wikipedia says that the locals actually call their country pridnestrovian russian speakers call it pridnestrovye , `` moldovan '' ( which is basically romanian written in cyrillic letters ) speakers in transnistria call it `` nistrenia '' . 
  romanian speakers in both romania and moldova call it transnistria . 
  `` officially '' ( in quotes , because transnistria does n't officially exist ) it is called \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 ( pridnistrovskaya moldavskaya respublika ) in russian and \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0441\u043a\u044d \u041d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044f\u043d\u044d ( republica moldoveneasc\u0103 nistrean\u0103 ) in `` moldovan '' . 
   i wonder how hard is to be allowed to visit pridnestrovian/transnistria if i visit moldavia ... 
  it 's not hard , it 's just dangerous , because the state is controlled by the russian and ukrainian mafia . 
  if you really want to travel there , go by train , not by car , do n't bring a lot of money and make sure to have a russian speaking guide with you at all time . 
  ah , also , do n't try to pick up any girls , many are `` owned '' by local human traffickers who are above the law . 
  these numbers are quite irrelevant , because they do n't take into account purchasing power or unemployment . 
  i totaled my friend 's car a couple of years ago becuase one of these `` smart '' guys who like to skip the line . 
  if my head and chest did n't hirt so much and my ears would n't have been ringing from the airbags , i would have probably kicked that motherfucker 's ass . 
  luckily , his insurance covered the costs for a new car . 
  it 's a romanian meme , full of internet jargon and grammar mistakes , so obviously using google translate is n't very helpful . 
  a rough translation would be something like : `` if you do n't like russian roads it means your mom gave birth to an idiot , how the fuck can you say something like that , yo fucking think before you say that ! '', 
  how exactly is moldova our closest ally ? 
  we might be their only friend , but it is n't exactly reciprocal . 
  tobacco , dog shit and the occasional signature smell of a gypsy who has n't had a bath since their christening . 
  i always hear feminists complaining there are not enough women in leadership positions , but i 've yet to hear a feminist complain there are n't enough women working in construction , driving trucks , climbing on utility poles to fix cables , repairing cars etc. 
  in the ideal feminist world , women should get only the high paying , non-physically demanding , safe and clean jobs , but not also the shitty , physically exhausting , dangerous and dirty ones . 
  i just wish people would be more honest . 
  these days everyone seems to be so full of shit : politicians , private companies , rights advocates etc. 
  it 's funny that now many romanian politicians want to build more prisons and improve conditions in the existing ones . 
  they did n't give two shits about the prison population for like 20 years , suddenly they 're all interested in the well being of prisoners . 
  seems they realized prison might just be their future home . 
  - money do n't bring happiness , but it likely feels better to cry inside a mercedes rather than on a bicycle . 
  - you either fuck or you do n't , the time of the dick is limited . 
  `` mama pro\u0219tilor e mereu gravid\u0103 '' - the mother of fools is always pregnant . 
  `` daca nevasta tace , n-o \u00eentrerupe '' - if your wife shuts up , do n't interrupt her . 
  -- v. putin, 
  not even then , the government would probably claim the bridge is still there , you just ca n't see it anymore , mighty russian bridges ca n't collapse !, 
  oh , yeah , i just took a look at the comments and saw obama being mentioned at least 3 times . 
  i do n't know if the commenters were being sarcastic or if there really are people so stupid that they blame obama for the shitty state of their roads . 
  if the latter is true , then i do n't think there 's much hope for russia ... 
  i do n't !, 
  drones are n't toys and many people who are flying these affordable drones have no idea what the hell they 're doing . 
  imagine what would happen if an idiot crashed they 're drone into a kid or something . 
  then there 's privacy and security concerns . 
  from simple things such as people who like to sunbathe naked in the privacy of their own back yard and perhaps not wanting their tits or schlongs ending up on the internet , to security risks like drones used for hacking or even terrorism . 
  wow , i did n't know the ukrainian army managed to shell volgograd !, 
  but , should n't we be happy for sweden ? 
  this is what they always wanted , is n't it ? 
  you know , multiculturalism , being open to everyone and all that ? 
  a paradise , right ? 
  oh , and swedish women need not worry . 
  they can go alone outside , they only need to open their hearts ( and legs ) and allow themselves to be culturarly enriched , deep inside . 
  umm , ok , i 'm no law expert , but i know how this shit works in my country ( and i assume it 's similar in most other civil law countries ) . 
  in romania we have something called a penal code , which basically lists every offence that would land you a criminal record . 
  the penal code is updated every few years to ensure it is compatible with the modern world , so it 's basically impossible for someone to be charged under some ancient sexist law . 
  except for the countries that have all but completely been colonized by white settlers ( like the us , canada , australia , new zealand ) , pretty much all others are currently shit holes . 
  actually it is , both archaic as well as anti-democratic . 
  in common law countries , the line between the legislative branch and the judiciary is pretty blurry . 
  what do you mean by drama ? 
  the media actually promotes this shit , there was some article about a girl and her grandma , both stripping on cam and earning like $ 800 in a day . 
  another story was about a girl and her mom regularly stripping on cam in their back yard and sometimes even in their neighbour 's back yard and making more than $ 10.000 per month . 
  her brother said he was waiting to turn 18 so he could join the `` family business '' . 
  the only family member who did n't want to get involved was the dad , but he was completely fine with his wife and daughter stripping and masturbating on cam for money . 
  here are the links ( obviously nsfw ) [ grandma and granddaughter ] ( http://www.cancan.ro/actualitate/bunica-si-nepoata-jocuri-perverse-in-fata-camerei-mamaie-se-codeste-se-scarpina-in-cap-dar-pana-la-urma-isi-scoate-sutienul.html ) [ mother and daughter ] ( http://www.cancan.ro/actualitate/caz-uluitor-la-dambovita-o-tanara-care-face-videochat-in-curtea-casei-si-a-scos-mama-la-produs-pe-internet.html ) conclusion : camwhoring is srs business in romania . 
  yeah , only the uk and ireland still have it . 
  romania : by day - the sound of heavy traffic + the sound of the occasional douchebag with a [ bmw `` teddy bear '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5p2soce.jpg ) or [ bmw `` kitty '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/77nqrzo.jpg ) ( this is how the e30 and e36 are known in romania ) launching from a stop light . 
  by night - the sound of random drunk guys having a laugh or a fight , plus the sound of the same douchebags drag racing or drifting in some supermarket parking lot . 
  i think it could happen in just about every country that still has common law ( including the uk and us ) . 
  come to romania 2 . 
  find girls 3 . 
  start a camwhore studio ( 100 % legal ) 4 . 
  i went to austria this weekend and they just waved me through , no id check whatsoever . 
  so what exactly does zuckerberg have to do with german neo-nazis posting anti-semitic comments on facebook . 
  it seems some people are simply unable to pull their heads out of their asses . 
  anti-semitic posts on facebook ? 
  alright , let 's sue the filthy jew !, 
  note to self : always use a vpn when in germany . 
  illegal packets *, 
  we did n't start from scratch , we 've had dial-up and isdn since the early 90s . 
  in the late 1990s we started laying fiber . 
  we developed our internet at the same time as developed countries , we were just better at it . 
  1 mile is 1609 meters .
