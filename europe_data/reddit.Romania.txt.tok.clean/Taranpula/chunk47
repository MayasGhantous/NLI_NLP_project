  any credible , grassroots opposition movement to putin would likely have their shit shut down before they 'd even have a chance to inform the public of their platform . 
  the shitty opposition movements are allowed to go on with their crap because it creates the illusion of choice , you can go either with `` moderate '' putin or pick one of these crazy fucks . 
  what do you think most people would choose ? 
  of course they 'd choose putin ... 
  the only thing that is significantly cheaper in bucharest than in budapest is transport ( public transit and taxis ) , but that 's artificial , since the bus and taxi fares are set by the municipal government in bucharest , which means cab and bus fares are cheaper in bucharest than anywhere else in romania . 
  property costs are also not relevant , because the difference is not that big and they fluctuate all the time . 
  so even though , at one point in time the prices in budapest might be a bit higher , a couple of months later it could be the complete opposite . 
  budapest is also a much nicer city than bucharest , so even though you might be paying a small premium over bucharest , you definitely get a much bigger bang for your buck . 
  in romanian : switzerland - elve\u021bia netherlands - \u021a\u0103rile de jos , typically called olanda ( holland ) united kingdom - regatul unit , great britain - marea britanie , typically called anglia ( england ) wales - \u021aara galilor fun facts : 1 . 
  the flemish population in belgium are called * flamanzi * , which looks like * fl\u0103m\u00e2nzi * and means `` hungry '' in romanian . 
  if you happen to visit romania and happen to be from the city of pula , croatia , you are bound to get a lot of giggles when you mention where you 're from . 
  you 'd probably run out of money in the first day . 
  moldova : - cheap as fuck - very hot bitches - you can bribe your way out of pretty much everything, 
  yeah , but saying everything is cheap is n't that accurate , considering we 're generally more expensive than all of our neighbours . 
  seriously , even in hungary , despite their 27 % vat , many things are actually cheaper than in romania ( where vat is only 20 % , 9 % for food ) and most others have a very low price difference . 
  bulgaria , serbia , moldova and ukraine are way cheaper . 
   everything 's cheap . 
  what ?!, 
  poland is much cheaper than romania , especially when it comes to groceries . 
   while i remember times when it was hovering around 8uah/usd , there 's no way , barring some catastrophe , like russia declaring actual war and overtaking kiev , to sink to 50 . 
  i would n't underestimate the incompetence of the ukrainian government . 
  if russia would take kiev it would n't be 50 uah/usd , the uah would be completely worthless at that point because there would n't be any institution to back it up . 
  renewed high intensity fighting in the donbass area would be enough for the hryvnia to sink to 50/usd or less . 
  in romanian it 's just start of sentences , proper nouns and pronouns referring to god ( e.g. 
  he , him , his ) . 
  we also do not capitalize origins or languages , germany is * germania * ( casually * nem\u021bia * ) , but germans are * germani * ( casually * nem\u021bi * ) and german language is * german\u0103 * ( casually * nem\u021be\u0219te * ) . 
  fun fact : since i mentioned germany , austrians are officially known as * austrieci * , but in casual speech are often referred to as germans ( * nem\u021bi * ) . 
  so i imagine the 29 % who do n't know are the jobbik supporters ? 
  polish pro-lifers should team up with romanian anti-vaxxers and then we can apply to join the united states and let the great future president donald trump show us the light !, 
  it 's not just about money , ok let 's say romania looks like shit because it 's poor , but [ bucharest is fucking rich ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1f/gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant%2c_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29%2c_by_nuts_level_2_region%2c_2013_%28\u00b9%29_%28%25_of_the_eu-28_average%2c_eu-28_%3d_100%29_ryb15.png ) and still looks like shit . 
  it 's not about not having money , but about wasting money because of corruption and incompetence . 
  for example , a few days ago i was driving on a section of motorway that was opened like 6 months ago and there were already road works going on , there are many money black holes like this , it 's ridiculous . 
  cheer up mate , at least you 're still doing better than us ... for now . 
  also , even with that 27 % vat of yours , prices are still cheaper than in romania . 
  the explanation is quite simple : 1 . 
  these are net averages . 
  in romania , the gross average wage is around $ 600 , but on top of that , the employer still has to pay some taxes for every employee that are not considered part of the gross wage , but are calculated as a percentage of it . 
  if these taxes were to be included in the gross wage , it would probably be more than $ 700 . 
  in romania , there is a disproportionately large number of people working on minimum wage . 
  this keeps the unemployment level down , but also drags down the average wage . 
  it 's surprising how small the income difference between romania and hungary is , but the difference between how the two countries look is so big . 
  it 's really sad . 
  ukraine is so fucked up , i ca n't think of a single solution that would n't be bad , worse or fucking disastrous . 
  it also sucks that the east and west parts seem incapable of working together to find a solution that fits them both . 
  i do n't know much about ukrainian politics , but when poroshenko became president i asked the ukrainians here on reddit why they were cheering because they replaced an oligarch with anither . 
  they were all like , `` nah man , this guy is different , he will reform ukraine , make it part of europe blah , blah '' . 
  i think most of those people who had faith in poroshenko have been brought back down . 
  it 's sad that so many people died in the revolution and still die in the donbass for nothing but a feud between oligarchs . 
  yeah , but the thing that sucks the most is that there are probably more than 4 million romanians across europe and the vast majority of them are normal , hardworking people , not beggars or criminals . 
  the beggars and criminals tend to move around a lot ( for obvious reasons ) , creating the impression that there are a ton of romanian beggars and criminals , when in fact its just a small percentage . 
  i have lived in romania most of my life and the most horrendous crime i 've ever been a victim of was being pickpocketed ( like twice in my lifetime ) . 
  it 's definitely not a dangerous country , not by any standards , that 's why i do n't think we deserve all the negative attitudes . 
  in my opinion , if western countries want to get rid of romanian criminals , their best bet would be to employ former romanian cops and let them do their thing their own way , they know how these criminals operate and how to catch them . 
  there are few things in this world that scare a romanian criminal more than a romanian cop . 
  that 's too late , that boat sailed when the logan became popular . 
  it 's bad enough to be confused with gypsies , you want people to confuse us with cars now ? 
  i do n't think non-hungarian people give a shit about hungarian politics . 
  maybe just the refugee issue , but then many people think orban is a cool dude because he keeps the refugees out of europe . 
  romania on the other hand is being scapegoated for all the beggars , thieves , petty criminals and everything else which is bad and comes from eastern europe . 
  hell , i bet if they included moldova in that list , they would have been higher than romania , despite it being inhabited by romanians , but is 4 times poorer and has a lot more organized crime and corruption than romania , it 's just that they do n't receive any press . 
   had trouble renting a bike in amsterdam , the guy asked for an id , i gave him my romanian one , he looked at it for about a minute and then said something like `` oh , romanian ... you 're going to bring the bike back , right ? '', 
  the dutch have a weird sense of humour , they actually think this shit is funny .

  in romania , rap can be classed into two major categories - underground and commercial . 
  underground rap is usually about politics , social problems , life in `` the hood '' and drugs . 
  commercial rap also takes on these themes , but very lightly and avoid using direct attacks , mentioning politicians or political parties , foul language etc. 
  commercial rappers also tend to take on the `` love '' topic , which is good for having a wide audience , but it 's a topic traditional romanian rappers would never touch . 
  on top of this , they also tend to mix rap with other music genres , like pop ( again , something traditional rappers just do n't do ) . 
  most commercial rappers started as underground rappers . 
  the only well known underground rap group that is still underground are parazi\u021bii , all the others have either disappeared or have gone commercial .

  well for starters , hungary does n't get the amount of negative press as romania . 
  the only negative news about hungary is about orban 's antics , which , frankly , i doubt anyone outside of hungary gives a fuck about . 
  the news about how hungary handles refugees , while controversial , it makes many people have a better opinion of the country . 
  to be fair , hungary is also doing much better than romania in many areas , they have cleaner streets , better healthcare , better roads , more civilized traffic and also their businesses are cheap and quality service while romanian ones are expensive and offer shitty service ( this is probably the main reason hungary has 50 % more foreign tourists than romania , despite being a much smaller country ) . 
  it 's not really the eu who is blocking romania and bulgaria from joining schengen , the eu always supported it , it 's some individual states ( mostly germoney and the netherlands ) who constantly find find bullshit reasons which have nothing to do with schengen membership requirements that block us . 
  i seriously doubt the 1938 number for russia is accurate . 
  from what my grandparents told me , the russians were very primitive at the time . 
   but it 's not really that new . 
  no , it 's not `` new '' . 
  the last days of the roman empire were pretty similar to what europe is going through today . 
  in 1968 , there was immigration in the uk , but not to the levels of today . 
  the same can be said about pretty much every we countries . 
  and it 's not just immigration , it 's also the fact that we countries are completely failing at integrating immigrants . 
  at this point , there 's just two ways this shit can go , and both ways suck big time : 1 . 
  people become fed up with this shit and vote massively for far-right parties , which , when they will have enough parliament seats will start making `` reforms '' towards establishing fascist dictatorships ; 2 . 
  this shit goes on , more and more immigrants come , there will be more and more pressure on infrastructure and public services , more crime , more terrorism until the states themselves collapse and we becomes the new third world . 
  merkeland , for instance ? 
  yeah , it 's just not fair to compare hungary or any other former eastern bloc country to western european countries . 
  if they both started at zero , and then the multiculti countries would have become rich and prosperous , while the homogenous countries would have become poor and shitty , it would have been a fair comparison . 
  in reality , western countries were already much richer when communism collapsed and then the transition years were also very hard for eastern bloc countries . 
  the multiculti thing is also something relatively new , sure , there was immigration before , but not with today 's numbers . 
  the real effects of sweden and germany 's multiculti experiment will be seen in at least 20-30 years and i 'm part of the growing number of people who believe it 's going to be a complete and utter disaster . 
  i agree with you , and i 'm not saying nominal gdp is completely irrelevant , i 'm just saying ppp is ** more relevant ** when discussing ** standards of living ** . 
  the type of technology a university can afford is not very important for the average joe . 
  regarding cars , computers , smartphones , i agree with you , they are n't affected by ppp , but those kinds of goods lose their value fast .
