  when you make such claims , it 's clear you do n't have any idea what the hell you 're talking about . 
  what kind of nobel prize ? 
  the `` nobel prize for street economics '' ? 
  my religion commands whenever i go in public i need to be with my dick out . 
  people give me weird looks , insult me , shame me and the cops arrest and fine me on a daily basis . 
  help , i 'm being ~ ~ discriminated ~ ~ persecuted by these fascist nazi racists !, 
  as this things are also pretty common in romania as well , i can tell you that drivers of horse carts are not the most responsible road users . 
  i can only imagine it 's just as bad , if not worse , in moldova . 
  on national roads , e-roads and motorways its already very illegal to ride any vehicle with animal traction . 
  on city streets , yes it depends on the local laws , but every coty who claims to be civilized has already made it illegal . 
  the only problem in this entire equation is the enforcement part . 
  the cops do n't want to deal with this shit , because when they confiscate horses and carts they need to store them somewhere ( and keep the horses alive ) , also it 's extremely unlikely the owners will ever pay the fines . 
  the cops prefer to just hide in the bushes with radar guns , because it 's a much easier way to make money and much less of hassle than to actually go out there and increase road safety by getting these extremely dangerous carts driven by irresponsible idiots off the roads . 
  oh , man , you do n't have any idea how much our government is milking car owners . 
  it 's like they want to punish you for owning a car , which might be understandable in some western countries were they have an extensive , comfortable , safe , punctual and fast public transport system , but not in a country like romania . 
  what 's even worse , is that the tax itself is fucking ** illegal ** . 
  it 's a long story , but i 'll try to break it down for you : - back when we joined the eu , people were buying second hand cars from germany because they were ( and still are ) cheap as fuck . 
  the government saw that and wanted a way to milk all the people who did n't want to buy a new dacia . 
  so they invented the so-called `` first registration tax '' , which meant that people who wanted to register a second hand car bought from another country which was never registered in romania had to pay a tax . 
  iirc the tax was calculated based on the age of the car and size of the engine , and it was a big fucking tax for normal cars . 
  the tax was eventually declared illegal and dropped because it went against eu law . 
  - this was not the end of the story though , after this tax was dropped , the ponta government came with another `` bright '' idea - the so-called `` eco tax '' . 
  this time , anyone who bought a second hand car , regardless of wether it was from romania or another eu country , had to pay a huge ass tax . 
  this tax was also declared unconstitutional by the constitutional court . 
  you know what the fuckers did next ? 
  they did n't even drop it . 
  you still have to pay the tax when you register your car , even though it 's completely illegal . 
  sure , you can sue the government to get your money back , but the fuckers thought about this too , and they said you can have your money back ... if you sue us ( which requires time and money , since there 's no such concept as a class action suit in romania ) and only in five years . 
  so , what happens , is the government is basically forcing car owners to loan it money at 0 interest . 
  and this is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  roughly 60 % of the price of fuel is just taxes . 
  so if you spend $ 2000 per year on fuel , $ 1200 goes straight to the state budget . 
  on top of that , you of course have to pay for the road tax $ 30 per year and the property tax for the car ( which again is calculated based on the engine size ) . 
  as if all of this was not enough , they 're now thinking of transforming motorways into toll roads . 
  you know , maybe , just maybe , i would understand all these taxes if we had a top notch road system , but we still have some of the worst road system in the eu ( there still is n't a single complete motorway connecting bucharest with the civilized world ) . 
  well , it could have been built with carbon fiber , but then it would probably be cheaper to just buy a car . 
  you should invest in western romania . 
  the region is developing like crazy , it has the highest gdp per capita in romania outside of bucharest and is the only one connected to western europe via a motorway . 
  a one-way ticket from luton to timisoara costs around # 50 . 
  edit : [ just look at this capitalist temple ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxqek9rylpe ), 
  after some research it seems it was financed by the us government and built by an austrian company and two turkish ones . 
  on farms sure , but not on main roads ( except maybe the amish , which are like 0.1 % of the american population ) . 
  tbh , except for romania and bulgaria , i 've never seen any horse drawn carts on roads in the eu . 
  sure , i saw horse drawn carriages in vienna , but those are for tourists . 
  even in romania , they 're becoming extremely rare nowadays , last weekend i 've driven more than 800 kms on national and county roads , excluding motorways and saw only one lone horse drawn cart . 
  growing family ? 
  i thought his fiance left him , he was crying like a bitch on tv a couple of weeks ago iirc . 
  step 1 - go to chisinau . 
  step 2 - dress nicely , with a business attire ( there are few foreigners in moldova , most go there for business , you do n't want to look like you 're there just to fuck bitches ) . 
  step 3 - go to a nice cafe , preferably in the centru or riscani sector . 
  step 4 - identify a group of hot 18-20 year olds with no dicks around ( to make sure you do n't get cockblocked ) step 5 - sit a table as close to the group as possible , order something fancy , then pretend to have a business phone conversation . 
  step 6 - observe the group , if you notice constant looks and giggles , it 's game on . 
  step 7 - approach the group . 
  start by asking them some stupid question or just say you noticed them looking at you . 
  hopefully one of them will speak english ( unfortunately , not many do ) . 
  step 8 - target the english speaking one , ask for her phone number and if she want to hang out , you know , `` show you around '' . 
  step 9 - take her out somewhere fancy , does n't matter where , except for very exclusive places , chisinau is extremely cheap for western pockets . 
  step 10 - tell her a bs story about how you work for a multinational company looking to invest in moldova , does n't really matter , she 's already crazy wet at this point . 
  step 11 - ask her if she wants to come with you back at your hotel . 
  enjoy the fuck . 
  that 's about it , just make sure to avoid virgins and prostitutes . 
  virgins will want to hang out but not fuck and prostitutes have more stds than an atm has cash . 
  not really , the us did n't occupy cuba and built their base there , they signed an agreement . 
  the fact that fidel did n't like it , does n't make it the us 's problem . 
  with moldova , it 's different . 
  russia has actually signed agreements with both moldova as well as the international community , committing itself to withdraw its troop by the of ** 2002 ** . 
  since then , russia only withdrew its heavy military equipment , but not its troops . 
  their only justification for being there is that they are a big , powerful country and moldova is small , shitty country not backed by anyone . 
   i always wondered where do they get a full carriage of metal in the same area every single day ? 
  there ca n't be so much new scrap daily . 
  they steal it from the scrapyards and then they sell it to another scrapyard . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  if you took a picture of that cart every single day , you 'll eventually notice the same scrap items . 
  i remember when i was a kid , i lived in an industrial city and close to my house was a railroad where trains would carry scrap metal from the scrapyard to the factory . 
  the gypsies would hop on to the carts , steal the scrap metal and then sell it back to the same scrapyard . 
  the security guards would hide in between the train carts and wait for the gypsies . 
  when they hopped on , the security guards would beat the shit out of them and throw them out from the train cart . 
  whenever i had to cross the railroad , i would sit like 10 meters away from it , to make sure no scrap metal or gypsy fell over me . 
  us troops are n't `` stationed '' in moldova , they went there for an exercise and they 'll go back to romania next week , unlike the russians , who came to moldova in 1944 and forgot to leave ... 2 . 
  russia actually had a military base in cuba until 2002 , when it was closed . 
  there 's nothing that 's stopping them to reopen it , if they want and of course , if the cuban government agrees to it . 
  the us would n't be happy about it , but i doubt they would be as butthurt about it as the russians are . 
  even if us troops were actually stationed in moldova , it would n't be a security threat for russia unless they brought in nukes . 
  moldova is a sovereign and independent country and russia has no rightful claim or authority over its domestic or foreign policy ( in other words , putin can go fuck himself ) . 
  russia has proven multiple times they completely disregard international law , including treaties they themselves signed , so why should anyone else give a fuck about how they feel ? 
  not members of nato , the eu , eea , oecd , has about the same gdp per capita as india ... no , i do n't think they could be considered part of the west by any standards . 
  they never left ... so yeah ... 
  that 's on the m2 highway , the one rebuilt by the americans , right ? 
  the road between chisinau and balti is so bad , it 's like an entire regiment of tanks passes through that road on a daily basis . 
  naah , more likely they 're going to get piss drunk and and fuck some bitches who wet their panties whenever they see a westerner . 
   but most people with self-esteem only drive them in the countryside ( cuz , you know , its much cheaper than a car ) it 's also illegal to `` drive '' them anywhere else . 
  yeah , i think facebook is the only major website written in php , but php is so bad they had to fork their own version of it . 
  moldova confirmed of slav . 
  yeah , that stryker actually has the power of roughly 350 of those horses . 
  well , pure bred horses that are for riding or racing are expensive here too , they can go up to $ 80.000 - 100.000 , but regular horses for peasants are $ 500-1000 max . 
  well , these guys were coming from romania , so pretty sure they saw at least a couple of horse drawn carts here as well . 
  an average horse costs around $ 500-600 , the carts are made from scrap so they cost virtually nothing . 
  the owners are typically farmers so the food for the horse costs virtually nothing as well . 
  getting a driver 's license costs $ 300-400 , it requires you to actually go to driving lessons and learn the law , a usable car costs $ 500 to buy , $ 1000 to register , the road tax is $ 30 per year , the technical inspection is around $ 20 and needs to be done every 2 years , an oil change is $ 50 , a liter of gas is $ 1.15 and considering an $ 500 car is likely not in the most pristine technical condition , the maintenance costs are pretty high as well . 
  romania has around 600.000 horses , compare that to germany , which has a population more than 4 times larger and only around 420.000 horses .
