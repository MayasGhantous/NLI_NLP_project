thanks , that was informative !, 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ooqtlpx.jpg ) tbh i have no idea what i 'm looking at . 
  now this is the type of trolling i can get behind . 
  the cables do n't bother me . 
  when i look at them all i think is that those are what 's enabling cheap hundred megabit/gigabit connections for everyone . 
  in that frame of mind , them being an eyesore is the farthest from the truth . 
  it 's weird , they 're pretty in a cyberpunk sort of way , kind of like wind turbines . 
  10/10 , would read again . 
  sure it is . 
  if a country wants to leave the eu there 's a process . 
  but if a country wants to leave moscow 's sphere of influence it gets invaded and annexed piece by piece . 
  yes , provided by the plane which gets internet via satellite . 
  normal mobile data also works over land up to a certain height . 
  it 's fine , gandhi 's so peaceful it broke the scale . 
  especially at fox . 
  exactly , and subs have an advantage here - if they make a mistake you can still hear the original language and maybe catch the error . 
  but with dubs you have no choice , if there 's not enough info to infer the meaning from the context the scene is basically ruined for you . 
  this is why i strongly dislike dubs . 
  considering germany is part of that agreement , moving the agreement east one country is just symbolic . 
  no , russia acts this way because putin and his friends want to stay in power permanently and playing world conquest politics keeps his public approval high . 
  and most importantly : there 's no threat , not now and not ever , neither the us nor the eu want to invade russia and everyone knows it . 
   also we never had anything approaching enough money for nuclear program . 
  you do n't need one . 
  nato could always loan poland some under the [ nuclear weapons sharing program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons#nuclear_weapons_sharing ) . 
  currently under this agreement : country | air base | custodian | warheads | -- | -- | -- | -- belgium | kleine brogel | 52d fighter wing | 10 ~ 20 germany | b\u00fcchel | 52d fighter wing | 10 ~ 20 italy | ghedi torre | 6th fighter wing | 10 ~ 20 italy | aviano | 31st fighter wing | 50 netherlands | volkel | 52d fighter wing | 10 ~ 20 turkey | incirlik | 39th air base wing | 60 ~ 70 total | | | 150 ~ 200, 
   going from being at the mercy of russian geopolitics , to being at the mercy of global jihadists is not necessarily an improvement . 
  russia has nukes and an actual army which is why they get away with what they do . 
  jihadists can always receive some * freedom * . 
  it 's not about working harder , but accepting lower pay . 
  for an eastern european even half of a typical uk wage seems like heaven . 
  yes , the same meaning is also present in english : http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sick, 
  english translation :  the montreux convention imposes a time limit on the presence of military vessels belonging to other nations in the black sea . 
  a ship belonging to a non-riparian country can stay for 21 days , but this rotation of vessels with major capabilities that can discourage the ideas of ** a sick man ** who thinks he can restore the ussr 's areas of influence has to exist . 
   [ ... ] the completion of the first phase of the project , which cost $ 26 million and started in august last year . 
    but once finished , the 43 km pipeline could reach an annual capacity of 1.5 billion cubic metres and fully cover moldovan needs . 
    the eu will pay a further $ 10 million for the second phase . 
  so it 's only a matter of time . 
  the funding is already locked in and considering it only took one year to build the first part this is basically a foregone conclusion . 
  that 's part of the joke . 
  but they did n't destroy anything , the crash did . 
   there is nothing wrong with renting and saving up money to buy later . 
  there are two major problems with this : 1 . 
  money paid on rent is money permanently lost . 
  instead you could get a loan , buy your house , and make the monthly payments equal to what you would have lost on rent . 
  finally when the loan is payed off you own the house and no longer have to pay anything . 
  you also have a nice inheritance you can leave to your children . 
  if you decide to move you can recoup your money when you sell the house . 
  all you lose is the interest . 
  rent means you 'd be stuck paying for the rest of your life and after you die you leave your children with nothing . 
  having to pay rent cripples your ability to save money . 
  if all your disposable income goes to rent you wo n't be able to save the large amounts of money necessary to buy a house ( or it would take an unreasonable amount of time ) . 
  this might not be an issue in rich countries but in places like bulgaria or romania it 's the status quo . 
  we have a saying here : `` we 're too poor to buy cheap things ( as in low quality/short lifespan ) '' . 
  yay , we 're not dead last !, 
  he is engaging in friendly banter by questioning your orientation , an adequate retort would be implying sexual relations with his mother . 
  since it 's a loan poland is n't losing anything . 
  on paper that money still counts as an asset for poland and as a negative number in moldova 's books . 
  additionally since moldova will almost certainly give back a little more as interest , poland comes out better than when it started . 
  in other words you can turn that line of thinking around : poland is n't squandering money , it 's using it to make ** more ** money through an investment . 
  since the world economy is n't a zero-sum game moldova will also come out ahead even after it pays it back because it used it to develop as a country . 
  theoretically everyone benefits in the end . 
  it works !, 
  when i look at them all i think is that those are what 's enabling cheap hundred megabit/gigabit connections for everyone . 
  in that frame of mind , them being an eyesore is the farthest from the truth . 
  it 's weird , they 're pretty in a cyberpunk sort of way , kind of like wind turbines .

  i 'm so glad someone caught that reference . 
  and if not , we 'll just go on extracting energy from another star . 
  i 've seen this story before . 
  let me illustrate . 
  so the people are revolting in kiev , they 're kicking out the puppet-government . 
  * nah , russia wo n't do anything about it , they do n't annex countries anymore . 
  * russian troops are invading crimea . 
  * no , do n't worry , they 're just for peace keeping and they 're not really russians , they 're just ukrainian concerned citizens with russian military grade weapons , russian vehicles and russian cammo . 
  besides , russia does n't care about crimea , they have a 50 year contract for the use of their ports , they do n't care about the land . 
  * [ crimea annexed ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26686949 ) . 
  * well , i was wrong about that but it 's ok because the free people of crimea wanted it . 
  ignore the rifles , no option to maintain the status quo , no time for political parties to campaign for one answer or the other , this is totally legit . 
  but they 'll stop now since it was all they wanted .

  does it matter ? 
  commie-flats look the same everywhere . 
  that 's happening anyway . 
  see eu 's 2004 european neighborhood policy , 2009 eastern partnership , and most recently in november 2013 moldova and the eu [ initialized their association agreement ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rp5uy/well_moldova_has_just_signed_the_association/ ) . 
  the recent events in ukraine are making moldova run to the eu [ even faster ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/ukraine-russia.uhd/ ) . 
   anyway , i know it will never happen , romania ca n't financially support this reunification . 
  on the other hand moldova only has a population of 3.5 million . 
  compared to romania 's 21.3 million it does n't seem that big of an issue . 
  union also means moldova instantly becomes part of the eu , the economic benefits from that might offset the initial sting . 
  like they 're not doing that anyway . 
  the only way to avoid it is by minimizing their influence in the region . 
  are those figures adjusted for inflation ? 
  in 6 years the us dollar lost 13.88 % of its value .
