  $ 1.236 trillion in 2006 = $ 1.407 in 2012 vs. the reported $ 1.322 trillion . 
  the difference of $ 85 billion means the gdp actually shrunk by [ 6 % ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+1.407+trillion+-+x%25+%3d+1.322+trillion ) . 
  no developed country wants to get into all-out wars . 
  or everyone dies . 
  both china and several european nations have nukes . 
  and if that 's not enough they 'd also drag nato which brings the us in with even more nukes . 
  so mutually assured destruction is alive and well . 
  the current game is information control ( industrial/economic espionage , spying on the general population , censorship ) , trade embargos/agreements , backroom dealings and misc politics . 
  probably because of information on circumvention techniques and free dialogue in the comments section . 
  i wonder how they 'll deal with full site ssl seeing as both [ imgur ] ( https://imgur.com/ ) and reddit ( [ via a subdomain ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/ ) ) support it . 
  block them completeley ? 
  mitm the https connection and introduce a self signed cert ? 
  ban encryption ? 
   `` we 're not intellectual . 
  we 're not obsessed with words . 
  we write detective stories . 
  we write suspense . 
  we write romance . '', 
  and ultimately this article is a bit pointless without a recommendations list . 
  so how about it , what are the best `` fun '' french reads from the last 20 years ? 
  scifi , fantasy , detective , young adult - go . 
  english translations please . 
  where will you be when the mdma hits ? 
  well , they tried : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_state#greenland, 
  not yet , but close . 
  it 's still supported for the time being :  extended support until april 8 , 2014 for windows xp with service pack 3 and windows xp x64 edition with service pack 2 . 
   extended support for windows xp embedded ends on january 12 , 2016 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windows_xp, 
  alcohol does n't get absorbed by the gums in any significant quantity , it works just like for everyone else - when it 's swallowed - and it produces a general whole-body sedative effect . 
  for a toddler with very low tolerance the distinction between alcohol and `` drugs '' is negligible . 
  honest question here , in a developed country is n't making a child beg considered abuse ? 
  even if you ca n't prove they were coerced and they claim they did it by their own accord , it still shows their parents are not providing an adequate home for them . 
  why are n't child protective services/cops picking them up when spotted and placing them in government care ? 
  blond children are very real . 
  it 's not for everyone , as the op said - `` parents with missing children '' , who would obviously give consent . 
  the op clearly said `` the dna of parents with missing children '' , not everyone . 
  if we 're going for humane , how about just not executing people ? 
  it 's a good question though . 
  the punishment for poaching is quite minor , it does n't make any sense that he 'd go this far . 
  one explanation is that he knows that if caught he 'd go away forever for something much more serious . 
  or he 's just crazy . 
  either way , it deserves investigating . 
  fun fact : that quote is from [ 1884 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/o_scrisoare_pierdut%c4%83 ) . 
  `` the romanian industry is admirable , sublime , but utterly non-existent . '', 
  until the easily accessible gold - read : cost effective to extract - runs out leaving the whole area a toxic wasteland that could wind up costing more to clean up ( if it 's even possible ) . 
  then back to poverty . 
  or we could just let the eu be an economic and political alliance , since that 's what it was always supposed to be . 
   if russia wants to invade moldova , it has absolutely nothing to fear . 
  wrong . 
  moldova is a member of nato . 
  not very , just shop around , see who has the best offer and monitor often what they change . 
  for savings accounts the `` fees '' are nickel-and-diming that only add up to something significant because of the large number of customers and time , as an individual they wo n't affect you that much . 
  concerning loans i ca n't really help you , i did n't research it . 
  governments can do more than one thing at the same time . 
  i do n't know about you , but i feel that the fact that we even reached the point of acknowledging this says something profoundly sad about the world we live in . 
  if you or the person receiving the email uses an isp or email service that has a us presence ( like gmail , yahoo mail , hotmail , and so on ) , any us govt agency can request the data through various means ( court order , secret nsa-we-can-do-anything letters , etc ) . 
  the company has to comply or else they could be fined/banned from operating in the us/us-based executives might get arrested . 
  basically even if your emails never leave eu based servers as long as any of the companies involved are vulnerable to us coercion your data is vulnerable . 
  technically this is against eu data protection laws ( what the article is about ) so tech companies are stuck between a rock and a hard place - either break us laws or eu laws . 
  consider this : if you ever get into politics and are not `` cooperative '' you can bet the details will get leaked right before the elections . 
  even if you technically did nothing wrong the scandal would be enough to sink your numbers and net a win for the competition who played ball . 
  mass surveillance allows for easy subversion of democracy . 
  not really . 
  triple glazed windows and heat insulation for the exterior of the walls works quite nicely . 
  the upfront costs would suck majorly though . 
   or is it saying that the people who came in are now leaving ? 
  that . 
  so in this case `` immigrants '' is used correctly . 
  here 's a [ mythbusters episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np-zdno4kdi ) that explains it . 
  it depends , if it 's fired straight up its terminal velocity ( the top speed gravity can muster versus air resistance ) when it comes down will be insufficient to cause any injuries . 
  maybe poke an eye if you happen to be looking up and ** really ** unlucky . 
  but if it 's fired at a lower angle it will have a parabolic trajectory and might not have enough time to slow down to terminal velocity , so it can be lethal . 
  however i would think a trained policeman knows how to fire a warning shot safely . 
  so romanians are no longer the boogie man of the eu ? 
  i 'm not sure how to feel about this . 
   i think cervical cancer vaccine is one of many good reasons a country needs to know what genitals you have . 
  not really , the vaccine can be taken by both genders and is beneficial to males as well - they wo n't be carriers anymore and it would create [ herd immunity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd_immunity ), 
  meanwhile in an alternate reality ... 
  or maybe mutually assured destruction worked . 
  when that was not in play ( conventional weapons only ) wars came and went as usual . 
  every account on reddit is a bot except you . 
   btw , tell me how open source software helps when random number generator on cpu is compromised ? 
  software does n't have to use the hardware rng in the cpu , it can use other sources of entropy , for example : - alternate cryptographic algorithms - data from sensors on the motherboard ( temperature , fan speed ) - sensor info from the hdds ( temperature , smart info , current rotation speed ) - sensor info from the gpu - noise from the microphone , webcam , and other peripherals - keyboard/mouse timings and movements - current free memory and hdd space - current i/o operations combined , all of those provide sufficient randomness , so it does n't matter if any one of them is compromised . 
  if the software is open source you can verify that it uses strong sources of randomness . 
  but if it 's closed source , it could rely solely on something like the backdoored [ dual_ec_drbg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual_ec_drbg ) and you 'd never know . 
  open source can also be supported/distributed/modified by competing companies or even your in-house team , ** literally no one ** is forcing you to contract one particular vendor . 
  in contrast , you do n't see anyone other than microsoft analyzing windows source code and writing patches , if you 're not happy with their pricing . 
  if any trade agreement/treaty/law even allows one interpretation where it 's a threat to internet freedom , that 's enough to reject it and avoid it at all costs in the future . 
  laws are not literature , they 're meant to have one interpretation , which should be exact and as narrow as possible . 
  consider the people writing these things - international trade agreements are drafted by lawyers and legal experts , they 're not stupid . 
  if something is written to be vague , that 's the intent . 
  and it 's not just techdirt that had this interpretation , the eff said the same thing : [ `` the agreement would also prohibit countries from enacting free and open source software mandates . 
  '' ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/tisa-yet-another-leaked-treaty-youve-never-heard-makes-secret-rules-internet ), 
   the u.s. has nothing to brag about here , i 'm pretty sure you spend a lot more money on senseless religion in their defense at least their government does not openly fund religions . 
  it did : https://imgur.com/a/2i3rh#lprdq, 
  yes , here 's the full album : https://imgur.com/a/2i3rh, 
  haha , that pic is the reason why / r/ladyboners had to add a rule specifically banning homicidal dictators . 
  i 've come to the conclusion that romania is actually very rich but 80 % of government funds are lost though corruption . 
  when you hear about some of the the bigger losses that go into ** billions ** of euros ( from a country of just 20 million ) it really is mind boggling .
