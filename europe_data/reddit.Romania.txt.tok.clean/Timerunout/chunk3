  he seems to be a good choice . 
  unaffiliated , good cv , no scandals and a technocrat . 
  basically what people wanted , now lets see him in action . 
  hmm , given the amounts of heads i do n't think we should spend so much on the ammo . . maybe v. tepes trademarked spikes ? 
  tough the green party might have a problem with that, 
  there are more than 30k people there . 
  if you see 5 people asking for anarchy thats absolutly nothing . 
  the prostest is against corruption , people asking for a new political class . 
  its not an easy task , but lets not be idiots , if people stop protesting , those against we protest will just bring other younger fuckers that will do everything how they want . 
  we need new people , not more promises that end up to the bin . 
  basically you are telling me that they are all biased ( more or less )  and thats why i said journalism in romania is shit , and thats why i take my news from 3 different websites . 
  i do ocasionally check their website . 
  maybe its good , tough it seems to me that sometimes it is biased towards the socialists , and do n't get me wrong , i 'm somewhat of a pro-liberal myself , but when i see some news i want it to be objective ( as much as possible ) and non-alligned . 
  probably one of the best news websites that i found is hotnews , their content seems very detached from any specific political orientation . 
  but i do n't know , maybe by being very paranoid about what i read i discredited digi24 for nothing . 
  i promise to check it more , you made me curious . 
  i do n't know really , i just do n't really trust the journalism in romania anymore . 
  hell , i do n't even own a tv because i 'd surely not watch it . 
  so in order to get the news i got about 3 news sites that i check every day then compare the content . 
  journalism in romania is very shitty . 
  actually just as many people watch a3 just like digi24 . 
  sincerely and personally neither of them are of any good . 
  well thats not hes priority because of his condition . 
  but it is the president 's priority , and hes also the one responsible for external relations . 
  the most inteligent response , ever . 
  `` here , i 'm just gon na feed my ignorance and deny everything you just said with a popular assumption simply because i disagree '' . 
  internet speeds tops in urban places obviously , but internet is reachable in most places . 
  every little town/village is actually required to have free wireless at the town center , and while speeds are obviously lower , everyone can get a fiber connected to their home . 
  you may be on the wrong post . 
  just sayin ' . 
  gdp does n't decide that , [ human development index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) does . 
   published on 4 november 2010 ( and updated on 10 june 2011 ) , the 2010 human development report ( hdi ) combines three dimensions : [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  a long and healthy life : life expectancy at birth . 
   education index : mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling . 
   a decent standard of living : gni per capita ( ppp us$ ) . 
  if you are in moldova , you eat that all year . 
  if you are moldavian and do n't know how to make mamaliga , you are a traitor of your own people . 
  that makes poland , hungary , romania and bulgaria worse then turkey , wich i do n't understand why it is a surprise ... 
  i think you linked the wrong article : http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/justitie/romanii+din+reportajul+sky+news+ridicati this seems more recent . 
  no it is n't . 
  the companies will always try to keep their net income afloat . 
  if you raise the wage of those who gather tomatoes , the owner of the company will sell their tomatoes at a higher price in order to keep their income on the + . 
  and here is exactly the problem , because those ee coming to britain rarely work for big companies who can influence the market on their own , mostly work on small farms or small/medium sized businesses who must adapt in order to survive . 
  and those businesses will be hit the hardest . 
  caesar for roma * nia * fits perfectly , just sayin ', 
  damn son , we should all increase prices !, 
  you are in for a nobel buddy . 
  ssuure ... because that always happens . 
   less immigration should mean an increase in the wage offered by employers increase in wages does n't just happen bro , money must be taken from somewhere else in order to increase the pay , either from other sectors or by rising prices . 
  anyway you put it , it is still a bad deal . 
  not really peanuts , but allot cheaper then what you find in other countries . 
  really , i do n't think that we could actually get a better deal . 
  romania is actually preety chill . 
  the only weapon i 've ever touched was a pellet rifle when i was a kid , and that was a wow-factor . 
  you will find knives , chains and all kinds of pepper sprays , but good luck with any guns . 
  [ the golden aquila ] ( http://www.magment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/golden-eagle-25.jpg ), 
  i guess it depends from where you buy it  . 
  if you have a confirmed place from where you can get a handmade good quality one , please share . 
  the [ cucuteni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cucuteni-trypillian_culture ) civilization in romania . 
  basically , an ancient culture that survives even today through amazing [ ceramics ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f7/8f/7c/f78f7ca0877a6d0d323d6a3ab10c3fa0.jpg ) . 
  from what i know , this is also the first artistical evidence found in the neolithic europe . 
  they do n't have a big impact on economy at all , as they are only produced by a few master potters , but because of their istorical importance and effort to keep it alive there is an annual pottery festival in the city of iasi . 
  another one is the making of * ie * , a [ traditional cloth ] ( http://cadys.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ie-traditionala-ct51-rosie.jpg ) worn by romanians since medieval times . 
  what is interesting is that every symbol actually has a certain meaning , and the composition is rarely random . 
  nowadays the interest for them regained power , as romanians started to romanticize their past , thus they kinda made their way into the commerce . 
  seing * ii * being sold at a [ retail store ] ( http://www.iiana.ro/ie-maneca-lunga ) is n't that rare , and most city girls have one , tough the quality of one made today versus a old one sewed by hand is generally allot worse . 
  personally i know a few people who did this , and they all got caught . 
  donno how , they were quite careful , but the cops still found out . 
  ofcourse , if you have a nice house in the middle of nowhere , thats ok , but around cities , nope . 
  just for info , but when you reply to a comment , you reply to that specific context . 
  now , i 'd tell you to get your head out of your own ass , but given that i already tried , good luck on your day , it 's clear that you 're simply pushing your own agenda . 
  i 'm from iasi  just so you can know how many kilometers your aim missed , you seem to be really interested in that . 
   ** my experience ** , freelancing . 
  writing , design , programming , all those you can learn by yourself ( internet ) and with enough patience and discipline you can make quite allot of cash . 
  but how he said , sadly about 30-40 % of what you make goes to paying taxes . 
  still , a better alternative ** then an office job ** . 
  this is the comment you replied to . 
  also , i could n't give one fuck about how you picture me inside your head , what i 'm more interested is why you display such an inability to understand why not all people think like you . 
  i never even contradicted your opinion about the working poor , and you know why ? 
  because.thats.was.not.the.fucking . ** topic ** . 
  it was a reply from my own experience about a thing that works given this simple context that started the topic  t 's not hard to make money in romania if you 're willing to think outside the box ( and i do n't mean illegal stuff ) . 
  ** having an 8 to 4 job is not a realistic option if you want to make a decent living ** . 
  so , is taranpula talking about a rural worker who lives on minimium wage or working the field ? 
  no , mostly targeting to city workers . 
  then , i replied to alexraccc who wanted some examples . 
  my reply , i repeat myself , was from my experience . 
  not `` this is the only and single way that everyone on the planet should use '' but `` from my experience , this works '' . 
  then , you replied with your 56 years old sailor father , and instead of accepting that you were out of context ( i did n't even understand where the fuck you where going with it at first , because it was out of the fucking blue ) you continued with a whole article about the working poor and how i 'm a detached and divorced from reality . 
  i do n't understand why i 'm wasting my evening with this , so can you tell me ? 
  are you talking about yourself ? 
  you were the one replying to my comment , then starting that hipster bullshit . 
  my comment was a sugestion , that works . 
  not a sugestion that works for everyone , thats something you drew out of your own ass , but a shit that works under some conditions . 
  then you started that shit about ur dad being a sailor , that was completely out of the topic . 
  i 'm starting to believe that you actually have some problems . 
  the only think you poked holes in is your imaginary subject , while inflating your ego . 
  you 're retarded . 
  you completely missinterpret my whole comments then go on a self-righteous rage about poverty . 
  i did n't even touch that subject , my comment was a reply to another . 
  but ofcourse in your mind i somehow said that everyone should become a freelancer , because thats exactly how things work . 
  you know what , i 'll let you find that universal formula for poverty , maybe you will even start a new fucking thread where that is actually the fucking subject .
