  imagine the russian army marching towards estonia with tanks , artillery , bears , everything . 
  - commander !, 
  there 's a wall 2 kilometers ahead !, 
  comrades , retreat !, 
  i understand why you would disagree , but he does raise valid points . 
  to keep giving them aid without them using it constructively and still warming up to russia , our enemy , does n't help neither us , nor ordinary moldovans . 
  as an analogy , it 's like when you give your kid money to buy a chocolate bar and your kid buys cigarettes while warming up to shady people who want to abuse him . 
  your answer to that is `` keep giving the kid money '' . 
  if i 'm to take a wild guess of what happened , the driver was a coyote ( people smuggler ) and while attempting to cross the immigrants into whatever country , something happened , a scare or something , many things could prompt him to quickly abandon the vehicle without freeing the people inside ( maybe he had reasons to fear for his safety or liberty ) . 
  the people inside were kept alive by the truck 's refrigeration and/or air-conditioning . 
  when the coyote abandoned it , they slowly died . 
  you ca n't easily break your way out of a refrigeration truck if you 're locked in . 
  i guess that 2 decades of being considered robbers and rapists by the rest of europe leaves some of us with an inferiority complex . 
  many of us are concerned about the possible economic blowback an anschluss might cause . 
  we barely started seeing meaningful progress on that front , it would be a really big mistake to unite right now if we take out the emotional factor . 
  it 's as if he refuses to believe that even * romania * is catching up to them . 
  can confirm . 
  my blue-collar coworkers have mostly gone to greece this summer . 
  trauma is not as logical as you make it out to be . 
  so what 's the end-game with this extremist politically-correct policy sweden is pushing ? 
  what exactly do they think that it will achieve ? 
  `` if we keep the public in the dark about crimes committed by muslim immigrants , they will become more tolerant towards them ? '', 
  this is pathetic even by nazi standards . 
  maybe they have some kind of tumblov or something .

  funny thing , i used to speak spanish , not really well but still i could converse with anyone speaking the language . 
  then i had to go to italy and live there for a few months , learned italian very well but somehow it kind of , idk , replaced spanish ? 
  i discovered that after learning italian , when trying to speak spanish i would actually speak italian . 
  weird . 
  `` the one who flies , the myth that represents the love for girls reaching puberty '' ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  story time : i have a friend that went with his girlfriend a few months ago to london , looking for work . 
  after working in a few warehouses with pakistani supervisors equipped with whistles ( i suppose that whips are illegal ) which whistle at you the second they see you catching your breath and after his girlfriend was treated like shit at the waitress job she found , they returned home . 
  not even 3 months they lasted . 
  the job market is saturated nowadays , at least if you do n't have any fancy phd . 
  yes , and nobody is gon na give up a jackpot willingly , or because it 's `` the right thing to do '' . 
  those guys that hooked themselves up to the deutschmark intravenous drip after '89 wo n't let go of it . 
  it 's up to us to take them down . 
  but we do n't . 
  we anaesthetise ourselves with beer , sunflower seeds and football matches , curse them when they 're on the news and expect someone else to take what they stole and give it back to us . 
  that 's not gon na happen unless we make it happen . 
  the politicians come from the public . 
  there 's no spaceship that delivers them i 'm afraid . 
  cuba , venezuela , poland , czechoslovakia , east germany , romania , china , vietnam , numerous others . 
  how many billions of people have to suffer because of it until we admit that due to human nature , it will never work out in practice as it does in theory ? 
  and socialism is totalitarian by definition , it 's not that it was `` done wrong '' . 
  the moment a government uses force or cohersion against people 's property and wealth , it becomes totalitarianism and kleptocracy . 
  the moment i 'm forced to give up anything that i have earned via legal work , then i stop being free . 
  i want to earn my living , to the best of my ability . 
  this socialism vs capitalism debate is really collectivism vs individualism . 
  and in individualism , you still have the freedom to form communes with other people and implement a private form of socialism . 
  while in a totally collectivist country , you are n't given the option to be on your own . 
  you either live collectively or force will be used against you . 
  that 's totalitarianism . 
  they even refer to eachother as `` comrade '' ... got into an argument with one of them , tried explaining that my country + many others implemented socialism and in each and every single one it turned out to become a nightmare . 
  i told him that i actually * lived * through socialism , did n't just read the theory in liberal college and that it 's not all that it 's cracked up to be . 
  the rebuttal was that it was n't [ * real * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) socialism . 
  obviously he knows better . 
  even if it was purely a symbol of genocide and hatred , what 's the point of banning it , honestly , what does it achieve ? 
  it 's not like neo-nazis will renounce their ideology because their symbol is illegal , it 's not like people will stop being racist if that symbol is illegal . 
  it changes absolutely nothing . 
  it just curbs freedom of expression and gets nothing done in exchange . 
  freedom does n't come with any `` but ... `` s . you are n't free if you ca n't express things that piss people off . 
  it 's like when a rapist does n't rape you because you 're too ugly . 
  op 's comment was obviously bigoted , i was just pointing out that it 's not bigotry to assume that a criminal is a member of a certain group as long as you do so because of empirical evidence and not because of hate , fear or ideology , in answer to your statement : `` blaming a violent crime on muslim immigrants before any information on the perpetrators is out is hasty bigotry . '', 
  and there 's no need to be rude , we 're just having a conversation . 
  disagreeing with someone does n't mean you have to be an asshat . 
  what if i assume that the perpetrator is muslim based on statistics and not on sentiment or ideology ? 
  would that still technically make me a bigot ? 
  hold that thought tho . 
  what if i hear a loud noise coming from the sky , would assuming that the noise comes from a helicopter passing by ( basing that assumption on hearing multiple helicopters during my life time ) make me bigoted towards helicopters ? 
  http://www.nrk.no/verden/oyenvitne-til-nrk_-_-arresterte-mann-i-30-40-arsalderen-1.12493512 eyewitnesses say he was screaming `` allahu akhbar '' , so he 's most likely a foreign language professor . 
  hint , polish guy : if you 're gon na tell uncomfortable truths that people agree with but hate themselves for agreeing , sugar coat it with a joke . 
  it does n't have to be a good or funny joke , it just helps not to get nuked . 
  that 's how people are . 
  people are weird . 
  the church has big support from the population . 
  it 's easy to get the impression that romanians oppose the church on the internet , which is populated with the young generation . 
  but out there , the church is popular and the people do n't mind if their money goes to the church , making our government 's policy towards the church kind of `` democratic '' , as much as we dislike it . 
  if you ask me , it will take another generation until the church stops having so much influence in the government . 
  i shall link to you the song of my people . 
  this corruption to the holy gospel of free marketism , the heretic crony capitalism . 
  governments must be cleansed of fiscal heathens . 
  i like how they consider the eu `` too homogenous '' while countries like japan and south korea are close to 100 % homogenous . 
   for some reason germany is expected to do that however . 
  or else !, 
  * slowly pulls the nazi card out of the sleeve *, 
  or what if we send them to [ madagascar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) ? 
   those guys ? 
  this makes the children of men movie kind of prophetic .
