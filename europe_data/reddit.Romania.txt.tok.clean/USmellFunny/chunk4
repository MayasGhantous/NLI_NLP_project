  they 're big enough to consider themselves a continent ( even though they 're technically not ) . 
  so they will always see europe as something * next to them * , not as something to be * a part of * . 
  romanian : evil cabal with the aim of world domination via debt, 
  it just seems to me that you 've never really talked to romanian women about their interest to go into politics and simply parrot some statistic without actually investigating the underlying causes of the disparity in those statistics instead simply call the result `` discrimination ! '', 
  with no evidence whatsoever . 
  there 's also a huge disparity in female representation in construction work and mining - something close to 100 % male representation yet nobody claims discrimination there . 
  or the lack of men as nurses - no discrimination there . 
  because men generally are n't interested in being nurses and women are n't generally interested in being construction workers or politicians . 
  not every unequal representation is a result of discrimination . 
   men make up 93 % of the senators but is that because of institutional discrimination against women , or because women generally prefer other careers ? 
  women in romania are really really really uninterested in politics . 
  i do n't think that that statistic is a result of discrimination as much as it is a result of individual choices romanian women make regarding their careers . 
  you ca n't just force women to go into politics if they do n't want to in order to fill some quota . 
  i 've had a broken foot , a broken finger , fell from the 1st floor of a building on my shoulder and been attacked by a pack of dogs , but ** that ** hurt . 
  also tell him that it 's actually spelled `` palinc\u0103 '' . 
  it 's not that you misspelled it , it 's that you spelled it in spanish that rustled his jimmies . 
  rome ( afp ) - hundreds of thousands of italians gathered in rome saturday to demonstrate against ** gay unions ** and ** the teaching of gender theories ** in schools . 
  gay unions should be a civil right , there 's no question about it . 
  everyone should have the same rights in the eyes of the law . 
  however , the term `` gender theories '' is kind of vague . 
  if they are referring to tumblr-esque `` gender theories '' , that 's just pure stupidity . 
  `` top russian official '' that 's very credible . 
  give his name or it 's just fear mongering . 
  i think men are more inclined to take positions of power naturally and it has nothing to do with cultural or societal conditioning . 
  each and every single society that we know of in history had men disproportionately in positions of power relative to women , i do n't think that absolutely every society we know of is sexist and that their men are secretly conspiring to keep women down . 
  i think that most women are simply not interested in powerful positions as men are . 
  it 's the biological truth of our species and i do n't care how politically incorrect it is to express it , i can not deny the evidence i see all around me . 
  crucify me . 
  the question is : is that the result sexist practices ( like institutionally making it harder for women to achieve ) or the difference in individual choices men and women generally make ? 
  every action has a reaction . 
  feminism appeared because of problems which only affected women . 
  now the men 's rights movement has appeared because after feminism reached its aim in the civilized world , instead of dying gracefully it mutated into something always asking for more from men . 
  now men find themselves institutionally and sometimes culturally discriminated against . 
  most women have no interest in the issues men are experiencing ( and vice-versa ) so that 's why the egalitarian movements are separated by sex - out of need , not out of arbitrary segregation . 
   people flee to europe : / r/europe says to repel them . 
   syrians flee to turkey : / r/europe says let them in , turkey , you 're cruel !, 
  the difference is that you share responsibility for the humanitarian nightmare that is syria . 
  you actively contribute to what those civilians are going through , so some might argue you have more of a responsibility to those refugees than europe has for its refugees . 
  most italians i 've spoken to missed the lira though . 
  yes , but not overtly . 
  it 's no surprise at all . 
  when you ask people on the street what they think of muslims , they 'll give the most socially-acceptable answer . 
  when you send people to the voting booth , they 'll vote for what they really believe in . 
  when people 's concerns are n't addressed because it 's politically incorrect to do so , they 'll turn to the extremists and into extremists . 
  `` right-wing militants '' when i read that i imagined armed paramilitaries in military uniforms . 
  perhaps not the best description of those guys . 
  of course , however i think that there 's a very important distinction to be made between `` not supporting '' multiculturalism and `` forcing '' integration : this is kind of how i interpret the policy of supporting integration but not multiculturalism : wan na integrate ? 
  cool , the government will help you do it . 
  do n't wan na integrate ? 
  still cool , but the government wo n't invest in helping you preserve your culture . 
  but it also wo n't ** force ** you to integrate . 
  no forcing people to do anything . 
  to be fair , immigration and multiculturalism are different things . 
  one can support immigration and integration but reject multiculturalism . 
  which also seems likely in this case , with germany 's extremely low birth rates . 
  the eu is great and all but both countries it played a part in creating ( bosnia and kosovo ) are failed states . 
   how do those people manage to survive ? 
  `` officially '' unemployed . 
  just because you do n't have a contract signed as an employee does n't mean you ca n't still do things in exchange for money , off the books . 
  that 's how those people manage to survive . 
  someone 's getting a gift certificate from nato to betray the country 's interest . 
  business as usual in romania . 
  not quite accurate - it just so happened to be in nato 's interest to fuck up serbia because they take kindly to russia . 
  i do n't think they 'll support any kind of albanian antics in macedonia tho . 
  it 's very popular with most people . 
  to me , nowadays it 's a freak-show where the shocking and the grotesque wins and actual artistry is irrelevant and unappreciated . 
  how i feel about what is going on in ukraine is irrelevant to the topic , i 'm merely commenting on the irony of ukraine supporting russia 's aggression against sovereign nations and then becoming a victim of the same aggression it supported . 
  russia did to moldova exactly what they are currently doing to ukraine . 
  funded and supported militias to steal part of its territory . 
  and ukraine was its accomplice . 
  `` to protect ethnic ukrainians '' i guess . 
  karma is a bitch . 
  know what else is unfriendly ? 
  our good friend ukraine allowing the russians in the first place to do that . 
   agreement on providing transit of russian troops to moldova breakaway region nobody else bothered by the fact that our `` friend '' ukraine agreed to this in the first place ? 
  well , the expenses and taxes are equalizing fast . 
  in many areas they 're already equalized . 
  the wages are the same . 
  the antonym for `` poor '' is n't `` urban '' . 
  because not everybody wants to leave . 
  only the smart people who wo n't have much to miss . 
  the brain drain is noticeable . 
  still , no schengen which is problematic in some cases . 
  and we 're experiencing a huge brain drain at the moment . 
  many people with a college degree is going in the west to work . 
  i 'm from romania . 
  let 's suppose we 'll unite in a federation . 
  why will i or any other romanian remain in romania to work for a shit salary when i can come to your country and do the same job for a much more decent standard of leaving . 
  that 's one of the major issues with further integration . 
   do n't listen to people that claim this has to do with muslims or gangs so it 's just a typical swiss family settling a dispute with a murder-suicide ? 
  any more info on the people involved ? 
  all i have is the article for information . 
  oh i do n't know about that , i 'm 26 years old and have been an `` anti-capitalist '' until about 2 or 3 years ago . 
  one might assume that i have my reasons . 
   they hate capitalism i usually stop taking any group seriously the moment when they say this about themselves . 
   people here do want to be part of europe as much as possible . 
  that does n't mean we should do dumb shit like implementing the euro just so we can feel more euro-ey . 
  reason is more important than feelings . 
  well , when you 're generous you give your possessions away and become poor . 
  they know fully well what they are risking , crossing a large sea in makeshift boats .
