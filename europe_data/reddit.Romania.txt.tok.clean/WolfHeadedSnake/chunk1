no worries . 
  they will have plenty * water of life * there . 
  it gets you pretty warm and it ` s rather cheap also . 
  if you know what i am talking about , lad . 
  there lies the promised land !, 
  i really wan na take a peek in the future , maybe 20 years from now , and see where we all are . 
  i would bet on some thing i would rather keep for myself at the moment , but then again i feel sometimes we all know whats going to happen . 
  just wait until mama merkel hears that shit you just said, 
  what a time to be alive , heh ? 
  and full of fire crackers, 
  is the number taking into account only middle ` easterns ? 
  * winter is coming * anyway . 
  in my eyes you guys are partly safe . 
  edit : [ i am sorry ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/migrants-find-disappointment-frustration-in-sweden/2973768.html ) . 
  i never thought they would consider finland . 
  those refugees should be scared sh * tless by now . 
  the messages on facebook `` do not come to finland '' should double by the end of the week . 
  i think we all need a nap . 
  this whole thing is getting us tired and agitated . 
  i am sorry i have to be so blunt but bbc please go ** fu * k yourself ** !, 
  90 % of the news that they air on this subject is with kids crying . 
  i think soon they will run out of children to film and they will start using older videos since maybe only 1/1000 of `` the refugees '' are kids . 
  i really thought in my own personal stupidity that bbc was way more serious than what they have proven lately . 
  manipulative wh * res !, 
  best answer so far . 
  thank you for the clarification, 
  i like bets . 
  what you said earlier is correct , never take big decisions rashly . 
  ** in my view ** , considering the whole situation europe is in right now , a new referendum must have been programmed after a much bigger `` cool down '' . 
  but then again every nation is different in how they think , act so on . 
   so it 's sensible not to take it rashly and discuss it extensively before committing . 
  thats why they `` waited '' so much for the next referendum ? 
  again , as i replied earlier to someone else , i feel scotland is ** forced ** to say yes . 
   people just do n't vote with their common senses . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  exactly . 
  as i said , i hate instability . 
  i feel like the scottish people are ** forced ** to say yes ... that is just what i feel seeing all of this, 
  yes !, 
  of course people are entitled to their opinion !, 
  but what i was talking now was more about stability . 
  the circle thing ? 
  when will you stop to decide , * yes , this is ok !, 
  * do not get me wrong , i just hate instability . 
  ** please correct me if my logic is and will be wrong . 
  ** you first had referendum i. 
  * democracy * decided that you do not want the split . 
  ** but wait ** we actually want out , so lets do another referendum !, 
  because the majority does not count ? 
  or who decides what the people want or do not want ? 
  because you are going in a circle either if you split or not . 
  * `` democracy is so overrated . '', 
  house of cards * edit : answer to maybe all of the future comments and to some of which are posted now . 
  i believe the people of scotland and forced to say * yes * . 
  this referendum comes to quick , at least in my eyes !, 
  several years should ` ve passed at least . 
  not follow , but be among them . 
  let us not talk now about the general case . 
  true , other countries seem to find their gov. 
  but i was specific about the current situation . 
  ** in my opinion ** europe 's leaders did not prove anything else rather than how unprepared and undecided they are . 
  and we can not hide behind the finger with that , * because otherwise we wouldn ` t be afraid * !, 
  right . 
  as i explained several seconds ago i find it really shocking that a person still thinks that governments do their job properly considering the situation . 
  i am usually really frank . 
  i am sorry . 
  i just seem to think that governments do not really follow their natural work schedule , if i might say . 
  i just find it weird that a person still thinks governments still work properly ( please take a look at the ** whole ** situation ) . 
  i hope i made you less surprised as i had no intention on insulting someone over the internet . 
  i find it retarded . 
   and for those who do , our government is well aware of that and does n't take it lightly . 
  i don ` t even know what to say to this . 
  you seem so pure and innocent ... 
  i think what he is trying to say is that the ** ressources ** you are talking about could be the sheer number of trojan horses entering now europe . 
  or at least trying . 
   stone age  middle ages . 
  * europe total war - middle eastern invasion *, 
  or putin since he is so eager to play yet another important strategic card, 
  is anyone here understanding the ** work ** we will have to put up to get these people out of the stone age ? 
  for the first time in my life i feel happy that my country is viewed as utter sh * t. i can only think how can we all help with this ? 
  why is europe so unprepared ?? 
  they seem like time bombs to me . 
  i am sorry for being so blunt , but they look to me like a lost cause . 
  you seem to be an immigrant too ... 
  people are still people , ystava . 
  christians or not if they dont want to adapt/work/be civilized they will become `` criminals '' no matter what they wear around their neck or on their head . 
  edit : recent research studies from afghanistan show that waving a cardboard flag and yelling like you are being eaten from the inside out should get you permanent residency in any eu country , no matter what your belief and/or favorite color is . 
  you know why people tend to do that ? 
  just because they think history kinda repeats itself . 
  why ? 
  well * when your girlfriend cheats on you once , twice , maybe the third time , maybe , just maybe , it is not a good idea and forgive her the 4th . 
  to be honest , i really giggled !, 
  well paid . 
  found this today . 
  i want opinions over it . 
  [ obligatory 12 min . 
  video ] ( https://youtu.be/wa80bt4lbxi?t=49 ), 
  well yes , that is true . 
  i saw this [ pic ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1641724/thumbs/o-syrian-fruit-vendor-900.jpg?6 ) a few days ago with the tittle * in syria life must go on *, 
  to be honest , i really dont know what is racist to say and what not nowadays .
