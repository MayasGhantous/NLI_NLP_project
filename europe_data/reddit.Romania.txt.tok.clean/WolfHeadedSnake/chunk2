  but in my mind i thought ** maybe they really love their country and want it to be good and its not their fault is bad etc. ** . 
  but then again i am wrong . 
  and we all know it . 
  and am i the only one that is finding this situation with the immigrants really difficult in drawing a line between common-sense-dont-say-racist-things and please-oh-please-get-out-of-europe ? 
  it is just drama . 
  cardboard flag and everything . 
  i thought i would sound really racist saying this . 
  you had bigger balls than me . 
  romanians are extremely tolerant and friendly to all that come into our country . 
  we have a moderately big gypsy population that we '' * don ` t take care of * '' ( if you understand ) . 
  that population that has romanian documents goes around europe making lots of trouble . 
  you can understand now , maybe . 
  excuse me , are you reading correctly what i am writing ? 
  ok , look . 
  i am not even goona quote anything from what you said . 
  i will be as short and ** frank ** in the true meaning of the work as possible . 
  romanians , at least 90 % from the majority i know ( i shall not speak in the name of my fellow citizens although maybe i could ) do not like * rromi * . 
  romanians , believe it or not , are very tolerant people . 
  i also heard that * alot * from the europeans that visited my country and talked with me ( ironically i am curently not living in romania so i am having a lot of cantact with them ) . 
  now the question , why are we so against the rromi ? 
  because they refuse to adapt . 
  ** most ** of them refuse to work . 
  ok , maybe romanians are not really stakhanov reborn , but still coming back on the rromi , they would rather steal , rob , beg etc. 
  than put those bones to work . 
  they also conglomerate into this hermic comunities in which they get social help ( that sum of money , you know ... ) and as part time jobs do the crimes listed above and more . 
  after the [ proclamation of islaz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_of_islaz ) we tried time and time again to find them a place in our society . 
  and everything they have done so far is to prove , i am ** not ** sorry to say this , that they are not worth the place in europe . 
  edit : let ` s just end this conversation . 
  this is better suited at a beer . 
  yes !, 
  i am aware of that and i am not hiding behind the finger !, 
  i know what the ** minority ** from my country did/does in europe ( and you should see what they do in romania also ! ) . 
  but what i was trying to say and maybe you did not understand is that i am talking about * integrating these people * just so we do not do the same mistake as we did with the gypsies - ** and they became criminals ** !, 
  as for what you find * rich * , ok . just one more little phrase . 
  22 million romanians ( europeans ) should not endure generalization just because a group of people that is not even europe decided to make romanian identity cards . 
  sadly most of them will not ... 
  i am going to say it : europe is just afraid its crime rate will exploade along with the coming of these migrants . 
  get it ? 
  thats easier said than done . 
  they need to be `` integrated '' somehow just so they can ** probably ** work for a living . 
  otherwise they will do crimes , as we have seen over the past 1000 years with the * gypsy problem * . 
  if we just pile them up , they are bound to start doing some bad things . 
  can you please post a link about that ? 
  i am really interested in what you said and since yesterday i can not find satisfying information . 
  there is a [ 2000 years old bronze dacian matrix ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=matrita+dacica&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;noj=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cb8qsarqfqotcky90dispsccfqimcgodmfslag ) found in romania that has ** lions , griffins and dragons ** on it . 
  edit : what i believe is that in the past there was a lot more interaction between people on earth . 
  a lot more than we think now . 
  you must have a spine for that . 
  well then ... let us just take a look and see what they ment by * powerful * !, 
  ( \u0361 \u25c9 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u25c9 ) * slow clap * + * heavy breathing *, 
  as a romanian i want to thank you for your kind words and for your open sharp mind . 
  i see it only obvious that with this growing problem of the immigrants some countries will find another reason to just leave the eu . 
  another push down the hill in my eyes . 
  please tell me that we are on the same line with the immi ... 
  how about [ this ] ( http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/pdf/81chapteriii.pdf ) for that model . 
  i think everyone gets exactly what i am trying to say . 
  right in the pride , spine and dignity . 
  as much as i try the proverbial `` hiding behind the finger '' , all of you must admit we are a really dumb specie on this planet . 
  with all our ai and reaching deep space and so on , we can barely protect our homes against our own kind . 
  ok , so now i am asking myself : how are these people simply slipping so many border patrols ? 
  or are they passing `` legally '' ? 
  i just saw what they did in debreczyn several days ago . 
  am i xenophobic if i ask why let them in ? 
  or am i so naive to think that border patrols still exist , somewhere . 
  sorry if i am late to the party , but since when did this thing really get so bloody out of hand ?? 
  i am aware of this `` explosive '' situation for only several weeks now . 
  when did it build up so much in serbia ? 
  i sometimes do stupid things . 
  without premeditation !, 
  i maybe insult someone , etc. 
  then i think about it , and try to never do it again . 
  but looking at this kind of people ... why ? 
  so that 's a good thing , right ? 
  i understand what finland did . 
  i just wanted to make clear that romania does not have any sympathy over russia . 
  i like to think that the decision was more pragmatic rather than under the fact that we are scared/charmed by any idea of russia . 
   and now romania is undermining eu policy and actually giving the russians an argument when they did n't have one before . 
  --   the foreign ministry said romania was `` obliged '' to allow naryshkin enter romania because the eu travel ban establishes `` that restrictions ** do not apply in the situation where ** * a state member has obligations of international law , which comes from a multilateral accord which confers privileges and immunity * . '', 
  --   state duma speaker sergei naryshkin arrived in romania on friday for a meeting of the parliamentary assembly of the black sea economic cooperation . 
  romania is anything but prorussian . 
  believe me . 
  although i am not aware of the benefits and privileges of that assembly , it must ` ve granted him some sorts of immunity . 
  edit : as an example , i remember not long ago that we refused a russian airplane to enter our airspace . 
  if i remember correctly he was the minister of external affairs ( ? ) . 
  he insisted so much in using our airspace to travel to his destination that he said next time he will be over romania he will be in a supersonic bomber . 
  maybe a fellow romanian can help me with a source on that . 
  we can easily talk about counties , not cities . 
  the county that everyone talks about is easily [ vaslui ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=romania&amp;city=vaslui&amp;displaycurrency=eur ) . 
  alcohol and lack of education made that place be the proverbial shithole . 
  it really resembles the aftermath of a war zone . 
  the law will have to pass the senate . 
  you are speaking the truth . 
  probably considered to be a busy sector also at night , they just want to be prudent . 
  ( or it could be the baclava !, 
  first thanks to / u/de _ dragon for answering most of what i wanted to say in a shorter manner . 
  when i said i do n't want to be xenophobic , i was about to address the majority of muslims in belgium , as i usually do with gypsies . 
  that is ** wrong ** regarding the muslims until , and i hope not , they will prove me otherwise by supporting such a party in mass . 
   religion is learned insanity i disapprove that . 
  depends how you are manipulated . 
  or how how much you want to be ( education comes in also , be aware !,
