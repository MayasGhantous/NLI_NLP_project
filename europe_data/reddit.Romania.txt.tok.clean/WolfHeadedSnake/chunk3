   it 's not clear that muslims in belgium support this party in a sufficiently disciplined way . 
  then we have to talk about this a bit . 
  as i understand it , either they like it the way it is or they just hope for better !, 
  why else would n't they vote for the alfa male party ? 
  ( or maybe they just * noped * to everything ) . 
  as i understand , most of the muslims in belgium like things the wait they are . 
  in other words , a party that wants the death penalty and sharia implemented ( plus maybe other details on their doctrine that i am not aware of ) is not really to their taste ( at least yet ) . 
  one of the reasons that the hungarian minority in romania elects udmr is that the party impersonates lots of their wishes . 
  we shall see in time how parties like islam adapt . 
   also for establishing sharia , introducing the death penalty , ... hahaha are you really serious ? 
  i mean this is also terrifying . 
  i am trying to contain myself to not say something really mean or xenophobic but think about this ; they could be really sure the muslim population could turn to them soon , offering plenty of support ; they also are pretty convinced in what they believe ( obvious alert ) since they have this * gentleman * in their ranks . 
  now , how do you deal with this kind of shit , * in europe * ? 
  how do you deal with 2 % which weighs more than a strong moral value or even common sense ? 
  is there any extremist party against muslims in belgium ? 
  what is their power ? 
  is the number of muslim people big enough in belgium so that political parties like this stand a chance to get ** any ** kind of power ? 
  i mean , any party that has a fat f * ck that beats a woman till she is disabled is a dangerous deal .

  it doesnt matter when proof comes up , its a privilege to slap it in . 
  have fun * `` paying taxes '' * if you get my drift . 
  so now the time matters . 
  i am also insecure . 
  you kids are the best . 
  keep it up !, 
  we need people like you . 
  i might sometimes find small proofs for what i stated , maybe , in the past . 
  anyway , its only a joy to read such interesting replies . 
  have fun with your life !, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qa8iv/bbc_protects_uks_close_ally_saudi_arabia_with/ you really , really are one of the funniest guys i 've had the pleasure of meeting here . 
  cheers , pal !, 
   go against what the government [ ... ] their funding or privileges are cut , or important people are forced out . 
  exactly . 
  of course !, 
  there are big differences and that is obvious !, 
  but in my opinion comparing for example an individual that stole a car every week to another individual that steals a truck every day , does not give the first one any credit of being a * cleaner * person . 
  it is hard to keep your integrity intact , yes , especially these days when money rules everything . 
  integrity , honor and other extremely powerful traits exist only because you can lose them . 
  otherwise they are just fancy words . 
  80 % of the big media today lost those traits and now have just fancy words . 
  https://theintercept.com/2015/10/26/bbc-protects-uks-close-ally-saudi-arabia-with-incredibly-dishonest-and-biased-editing/ how about take a look at this . 
  dont get me wrong , i dont like rt at all . 
  i just hate ** all ** media equally . 
  have a nice day . 
  free from state : https://theintercept.com/2015/10/26/bbc-protects-uks-close-ally-saudi-arabia-with-incredibly-dishonest-and-biased-editing/ but you know better . 
  yes , i am seriously putting bbc and russia today and any other big manipulative machinery on the same line . 
  https://theintercept.com/2015/10/26/bbc-protects-uks-close-ally-saudi-arabia-with-incredibly-dishonest-and-biased-editing/ because thats what they are , son . 
  https://theintercept.com/2015/10/26/bbc-protects-uks-close-ally-saudi-arabia-with-incredibly-dishonest-and-biased-editing/ read this * massive * false equivalency . 
   the bbc loves to boast about how `` objective '' and `` neutral '' it is . 
  but a recent article , which it was forced to change , illustrates the lengths to which the british state-funded media outlet will go to protect one of the u.k. government 's closest allies , saudi arabia , which also happens to be one of the country 's largest arms purchasers . 
  not long ago i got pointed out that i am very badly informed after saying how * unfair * ( to say the least ) bbc is . 
  i even got a comment saying bbc is * possibly the global standmark for integrity in mass media * . 
  i sometimes hate when i am right , especially in situations like this . 
  mass-media is a huge machinery used to manipulate and ruin our lives . 
  yes , ** ruin our lives ** . 
  no matter if it is rt , bbc , etc. 
  thats why i really did not want to translate the term . 
  to be correct about `` virgin forests '' you really have to use the terminology used in every country , specific to the norms used to deal with the forest . 
  yes , you might be right with the forests never touched by man . 
  the closes place we can talk about that , near europe , is remote siberia . 
  as for the techniques , i have worked for the romanian state for about 1 year , period in which as i understood all types of procedures are applied do to the diverse type of terrain , terrain that imposes different types of arboretum all around romania . 
  i worked in the mountain area 800-2000m , i had fagus sylvatica , acer ( mainly all of them ) , betula pendula , carpinus , and obviously picea abies and abies alba . 
  photo 4 and 5 ( i do n't know if you see them in the same order as me ) . 
  nice * smart-phone * you 've got there . 
  and to be really mean , seems like a really modern one by the size of it . 
  there are no more * virgin * forests present in romania . 
  the term is used to make people understand what forests we are talking about . 
  i am talking about the term used as untouched-amazon-like-wild . 
  the real and correct term for `` romanian virgin forests '' is * arborete primare * ( i am sorry about the romanian but i will not translate it and give it a different meaning ) . 
  that means that in those forests you are allowed ** sometimes ** to do * lucr\u0103ri de conservare * ( translation : actions to conserve the ecosystem ) but never extract wood to work with , hunt , pick up berries etc. 
  also what / u/fuckingusarnames said is precise . 
  source : i have a degree in forestry engineering, 
  well , fuck . 
  so what do you define by `` the most romanian '' ? 
  i share your opinion . 
  can someone please explain to me exactly how many years the uk pays this amount of money for a person ? 
  so if he works the uk only pays 10000 ? 
  or they just pay until the individual gets that * permit * ( ? ), 
  to work freely in the uk and then everything stops ? 
  edit : * `` an adult benefit claimant from syria costs up to # 23,420 , or # 10,720 if they were able to work , the document said . 
  '' * is able to work used in the sense if he is physically able or legally ? 
  if some of them have the will , power , desire whatever it is to show it , that does not mean that other might not be ( are ) * state coordinated * . 
  to be honest , i find the latter the most dangerous . 
  just asking if you really consider them `` free media with a bias '' as you say . 
  they fit as big . 
  because i could easily and without remorse consider them ** huge ** manipulative machines . 
  i will just throw some random letters at you : bbc , cnn . 
  i can go on if you want . 
  so what should we do ? 
  what you say is true !, 
  but considering the incidents in the last year , i believe some people are getting * bold * in acting violent . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't live in hello kitty i am in an adventure world . 
  i know shit is fucked up ever since forever . 
  i really hope the people that came in europe did n't pack more than just undies and some food for the trip ... 
  apparently a grenade . 
  that moment when you hit so hard and fast with your fists that you confuse ministers , media and everyone in thinking you are firing a firearm . 
  [ next ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tol1txrla1c ), 
   they were armed and entered into a shootout with the police authorities . 
  are you kidding me ??? 
  last night one of my swedish friends told me a grenade was thrown at a police car in sweden .
