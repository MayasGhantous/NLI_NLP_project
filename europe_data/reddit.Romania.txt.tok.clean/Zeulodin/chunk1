well , among the [ most popular tags ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/search?q=flair%3a%27bul%c4%83u%27&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on ) we use on / r/romania is the `` bul\u0103u '' one , slang for `` prison '' , used for articles about high-profile court cases . 
  i ca n't seem to find it now , but vintil\u0103 mih\u0103ilescu has a really good paper on the way the sarma is claimed by pretty much everyone from the adriatic to iran as being `` their '' food . 
  it might be this one , if anybody has better access to journals than i do :  mih\u0103ilescu , vintil\u0103 ( 2003 ) , `` la probl\u00e9matique d\u00e9construction de la sarma . 
  [ the entrance to my hometown ] ( http://www.contrasens.com/2012/03/05/s-a-instalat-mig-ul-de-la-moinesti-se-asteapta-bacaul.html )  at the request of the archiepiscopate of roman and bac\u0103u , the ministry of defense donated two out-of-use migs , to be used as monuments . 
  i do n't think the falklands will be in a hurry to join , to be fair . 
  i have n't seen him ( or thought of him ) in years and [ googling him now ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=victor+ciorbea&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=p9qcusqsnotvtqaei4d4bw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=642 ) is super weird . 
   jokes about mannerheim that 's like your atat\u00fcrk , right ? 
  * nail-biting *, 
   a large increase in immigration has caused the immigration office to have their employees work 6 days a week . 
  and in shifts . 
  they have also requested additional funding . 
  well , you know , if you guys need more work force , you know who is usually interested in working overtime for less money ? 
  immigrants . 
  just saying . 
  it 's like a problem that solves itself . 
  if i had enforced that rule , i only would have had like 3 beers all highschool . 
  [ this abomination ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lvu31i7swkg/tmthjw1uvki/aaaaaaaaane/azeq3gjld2q/s400/5942177001549.jpg ) , which they advertise as `` german beer '' is one of the only beers that i could just not drink , regardless of the fact that i am an alcoholic . 
  it 's the ultra-hip rabies night-club . 
  obligatory joke about how they 're not going to be 12 european countries by 2020 . 
   under the new format , uefa has promised to take traveling distances into account when allocating countries who have been selected as hosts to groups . 
  so probably no reykjavik in one day and athens in the other . 
  so we just gon na start using the not-at-all dystopic term of `` illegals '' now , like it ai n't no thang ? 
  besides everything else already mentioned in this thread , here are my contributions , heavily biased towards some genres : [ piranha bytes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piranha_bytes ) ( germany ) made some of my favourite games and arguably one of the best rpg series of all times , [ gothic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gothic_ ( series ) ) . 
  [ revolution software ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolution_software ) were the creators of some huge titles in the adventure genre , like [ beneath a steel sky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beneath_a_steel_sky ) and the [ broken sword ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/broken_sword ) series . 
  [ larian studios ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larian_studios ) ( belgium ) has a low-key but strong presence in the rpg scene with their [ divinity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divine_divinity ) series , most recently making the best rpg ( and some , like gamespot , might samy best pc game ) of 2014 : [ divinity : original sin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divinity:_original_sin ) . 
  [ funcom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/funcom ) ( norway ) made [ the longest journey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_longest_journey ) , one of the best regarded adventure game in the history of the genre and had some of the biggest names in mmorpgs with [ anarchy online ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchy_online ) , [ age of conan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_conan:_hyborian_adventures ) and [ the secret world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_secret_world ) . 
  i personally consider the latter as being one of the best written games i ever played , with an amazing setting and quest system that is miles away from anything else i 've seen in an mmo . 
  [ attic entertainment software ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attic_entertainment_software ) ( germany ) made a series of excellent rpgs in the 1990s , called [ realms of arkania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/realms_of_arkania:_blade_of_destiny ) , based on the german pen-and-paper rpg [ the dark eye ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dark_eye ) ( das schwarze auge ) . 
  [ daedalic entertainment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daedalic_entertainment ) ( germany ) are steadily releasing adventure games starting with 2008 , at a time when the genre had few noteworthy releases . 
  the [ deponia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deponia_ ( video_game ) ) series is their most famous , with numerous other titles that are worthy of your attention . 
  recently they tried their hand at rpgs , with [ blackguards ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dark_eye:_blackguards ) and its sequel , also based on the dark eye . 
  [ almost human ] ( http://www.grimrock.net/games/ ) ( finland ) brought back the `` blobber '' ( grid-based first-person multi-character dungeon crawler ) genre back to life in 2012 with their [ legend of grimrock ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legend_of_grimrock ) game . 
  it was a hit with both old-school fans of the long neglected genre , as well as with the modern public . 
  last year they released [ a sequel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legend_of_grimrock_ii ) which was described as superior in almost every aspect to the original title . 
  [ numantian games ] ( http://www.lordsofxulima.com/about-us/ ) ( spain ) made a criminally overlooked turn-based rpg last year called [ lords of xulima ] ( http://www.lordsofxulima.com/ ) , which combines an isometric exploration screen with a first-person combat screen . 
   the hungarian way of life . 
  for anybody curious , the hungarian way of life consists of eating langos , drinking on the banks of the danube and crying about trianon . 
  source : i lived in hungary . 
  the only real problem with this is how many people have shitty friends that just leave people on the ground or take pictures with their butts pressed to their face . 
  if your friend is kill and you want to party hard some more , put their drunk ass into a cab and send them home , do n't let them lie in a pool of piss . 
  source : am alcoholic . 
  on a related note , i think it 's funny how the same internet communities that usually cry `` what about the men ? '', 
  and claim that men are being victimised by modern society have suddenly started to be all `` these mothefuckers are n't women and children who need protection , they 're grown men , turn them away . '', 
   syriza  communists lol . 
  btw , i find it incredible that this subreddit started supporting the hungarian government ( after blaming it for months for being pro-russian ) , just because orban went full fascist so he gets the jobbik votes . 
  posts talking about '' poor hungary '' being attacked by the arab hordes are increasing in number on this sub , despite the hungarian government continuing its descent into totalitarianism . 
  europe 's poor response to the crisis plays into orban 's anti-eu/pro-russia discourse so he is politically milking the situation as best he can . 
  also , people talking about the pro-refugee bias in western media and then upvoting to the first page a post from the fucking police.hu website are delusional . 
  oh , sweet baby jesus yes !, 
  he was easily in my top 3 . 
  [ dna be like ] ( http://www.suitlesspursuits.com/uploads/20140407/article-2415853-002cd0a400000258-494_634x490.jpg ) . 
  well , not this one , but romanians were involved in [ the other incident ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/externe/zece-imigranti-raniti-in-ungaria-dupa-ce-o-camioneta-condusa-de-un-roman-s-a-rasturnat-surse-in-masina-se-aflau-circa-40-de-imigranti-14692088 ) , which happened today in hungary , where a truck filled with 40 syrian migrants flipped . 
  10 of them are wounded , but no casualties . 
  [ ric\u0103 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c4%83ducanu_necula ) is a legend , btw . 
  it 's edam shame this pun thread did n't really go anywhere . 
  my hipster sense is tingling . 
   just fairly bad as specific things , like people . 
  yeah , i would n't really call him a people person . 
  is it scientology ? 
   the problem is the rate of illegal immigration that will eventually make europeans a minority on their own continent . 
  that will just not happen . 
  the only cases in history where immigrants become a majority and began to run the local minority were those where europeans were the immigrants , like australia and the americas . 
   gypsies just grow those islamist beards , pretend to be religious then take their money and spend them on drinks . 
  please tell me you do n't actually believe that . 
   do n't assume others are n't clever enough to see through your true intentions . 
  / r/conspiracy -- , 
  yup , and their segregation policy seems to be doing wonders . 
  look at all the ethnic tensions that were resolves by segregating a minority . 
   well , if it 's hunnic then it 's not hungarian . 
  if you think that will keep nationalists from getting angry , you have n't met many so far . 
  it sucks to have your sheep killed by a wolf , sure , but they are super-important in the big picture . 
  gon na [ leave this here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5obhxz-q ) . 
  yeah , this whole culture of fear thing is ridi-what the fuck was that ? 
  as far as i know , the leading theory is that it is a hunnic legend that originated in inner mongolia and has travelled to europe with their migration , spreading around south-east europe . 
  tl ; dr : one of the myths that romanians hold most dear is probably of hungarian origin , * isten * laughs . 
  deal-breaker . 
  the term itself might be of american origin , but it is being applied to a group of people who have always existed . 
  whether you call them hipsters , bourgeois-boh\u00e8me , urbans , artsy-types , it does n't really matter . 
  the only thing the term hipster has done was make it easier to transform it into an insult by stretching the definition way past its natural breaking point . 
  the term literally has no meaning anymore . 
  you got somebody in this thread who thinks hipsters wear fedoras . 
  no , not really . 
  i mentioned oberth 's invention above that , regarding the multi-staged rockets . 
  but i did do a mistake , in i that initially thought that [ this article ] ( http://foaienationala.ro/inventii-mai-mult-sau-mai-putin-cunoscute-ale-romanilor.html ) , which can be found across multiple websites , lumps von braun together with oberth , claiming them to be `` from among romania 's minorities '' . 
  i accidentally a word when reading , it `` merely '' claims that oberth was `` von braun 's teacher '' . 
  i read the sentence as `` and also , professor von braun '' , instead of `` and also , professor of von braun '' . 
  good catch !, 
  that 's obviously what nasa wants you to believe . 
  romanians invented everything and then the ( usually ) americans stole it . 
  things that we invented and were stolen from us include - writing ( [ t\u0103rt\u0103ria tablets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c4%83rt%c4%83ria_tablets ) ) - writing ( again - this time by the dacians , who invented the first alphabet but did not use it because they realized its destructive potential . 
  later stolen by hungarians ) - insulin ( real inventor was denied the nobel prize because he was `` aggressively anti-masonic '' ) - the jetpack - the flying car - non-tree paper - ejector seat - multi-stage rockets ( back in the 1500s ) - nikola tesla ( real name nicolae teslaru ) - artificial radioactivity ( later stolen by marie curie for destructive purposes ) - steam-powered car - first oil refinery - the aeroplane ( each year , from 2nd to 4th grade i was told a different romanian invented flying . 
  first it was traian vuia , then aurel vlaicu and then hendri coand\u0103 ) - modern astrophysics ( by proving that the axis on which earth moves around the sun in variable ) - rocket science ( apparently some websites consider wernher von braun romanian ) - a glass cd that can last for 5000 years and can hold 15,000 times more information than a normal cd . 
  - 3d cinema - engine that runs on gravity - engine that runs on water - engine that runs on magnets - particle teleportation - light treatment ( his friend , albert einstein , warned him that he is a dreamer if he believes the big pharma companies will let him use such a thing ) the sad part is that some of these claims contain half-truths and there were clearly scientists that did pioneering work in their respective fields , only to become , years later , either deified by some or ridiculed by others . 
  there 's a saying over here : romania only has two good neighbours . 
  serbia and the black sea . 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ other ^ ^ neighbourbros, 
  bonus points if you say it while doing [ this gesture ] ( http://usvsth3m.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ssnvg4k.gif ) . 
  sooo , is anyone from the 70s left in britain who is n't an alleged sex offender ? 
  i 'm bad at recognizing artists , but i 'll put down the really obvious ones , that i do know and let others complete the list : romania - [ \u0218tefan luchian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c8%98tefan_luchian ) - dou\u0103 fete spain - pablo picasso - [ les femmes d'alger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_femmes_d%27alger ) ( version o ) norway - edvard munch - [ the scream ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_scream ) ireland - francis bacon - [ three studies of lucian freud ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_studies_of_lucian_freud ) austria - gustav klimt - [ portrait of adele bloch-bauer i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portrait_of_adele_bloch-bauer_i ) netherlands - vincent van gogh - [ portrait of dr. gachet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portrait_of_dr._gachet ) france - that 's probably one of monet 's lake ones , but i ca n't figure out which one . 
  italy - amedeo modigliani - la bella romana,
