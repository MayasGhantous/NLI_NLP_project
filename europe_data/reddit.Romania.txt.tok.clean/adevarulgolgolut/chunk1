one does not need to live in fantasy land to make abstract statements or employ conceptual shorthand . 
  repercussions can be significant or insignificant , and relevant or irrelevant as a consequence of that . 
  you 're failing badly at it then , because this  then eu can sell their products to the people who would have bought from these other countries does n't actually seem to be the case . 
  also , russia has been in a depression , so russia ca n't be an indirect driver of demand as you propose . 
  edit : as for that sentence , you seem to have forgotten that there is a qualifier in it ( `` all else being equal '' ) . 
  [ but ... 
  what ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g861v/european_commission_one_year_after_russia_banned/ctvra5g ), 
  [ read downthread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g861v/european_commission_one_year_after_russia_banned/ctvtnyy ) : a significant portion of what the eu used to sell to russia , it is not selling to anyone else ( tomato exports are down 44 % year on year , for example ) so i 'm not sure what you 're trying to hint at . 
  i gave you a specific example , and your whole `` rebuttal '' to it is that it can not in any way be construed as propagandistic ( i.e. 
  purposefully misleading ) in nature because you do n't * think * that 's the case ? 
  well , since you so diligently refuse to drop the personal attack angle , i 'll just reply in kind : maybe you are so used to being lied to ( either plainly or by omission ) that you pay it no mind . 
  or , like i said , maybe you 're simply disingenuous , since from the start you deemed it appropriate to reply to my qualifying a statement , with you qualifying my person . 
  you continue to do so , your paper thin pseudo-apologies and half-baked `` justifications '' notwithstanding . 
  this is not analogous to an investment , and most of the growth is in countries where eu countries already had significant turnover , like china and the us . 
   russians were willing to pay more for simple milk and so they just sent trucks across the border . 
  china ? 
  south america ? 
  africa ? 
  why bother when i can ski in the alps . 
  dairy exports did not increase , they suffered a nose-dive . 
  the growth for powdered milk and similar products was paltry in comparison , insufficient to cover losses . 
  there is nothing here that suggests the situation will have turned out to be on the whole beneficial due to and not in spite of the sanctions game . 
  read the full report , it does n't support your claim at all . 
  your whole argument is that `` they did not lie '' , which is a non-argument , because propaganda is n't propaganda because it is necessarily false , but because it is purposefully misleading , usually by presenting facts selectively or modifying the subtext of the information exchange , both of which are exemplified in the op post and is most patently clear in [ the infographic accompanying it ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11779844_912030908844390_1161129286947612513_o.jpg ) which even stoops to marketing industry lows like deceptive font and text formatting ( it is particularly easy to mistake `` 1.7 billion to china '' for `` 17 billion to china '' or `` 3.6 % switzerland '' for `` 36 % switzerland '' , for example ) . 
  edit : also , `` i will suggest you 're a russian shill , but am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt '' is a straight attack on me as an individual , not on what i said , more so when you continue to push ( and amplify ) that angle . 
  next time you want to be this disingenuous , try to be more subtle . 
  the dairy farmers who were in a position to do so would have diversified their businesses as necessary regardless of the sanctions and ensuing debacle . 
  those are just an extra complication . 
  as for your other point , russia is in a full blown economic depression right now , in part due to the eu and us imposed sanctions , so i would rather look at the situation as russia being in a weaker position , because that accounts for most of the success differential between russia and the eu . 
  as long as the sanctions will continue to be more detrimental to russia than the eu , they will make us stronger all the same . 
  i am only using the term because it applies in this case . 
  maybe you should address the matter at hand instead of attacking my character . 
  it being a statement of fact does not preclude the link and graphic in the op from being propagandistic in nature , i.e. 
  it does n't matter that the information is technically correct when it is being pulled out of context and framed so as to influence more than inform . 
  i 'm not talking about the commission 's report . 
  most people will not bother to read what the report actually says . 
  this thread has itself plenty of replies that are indicative of that . 
  we do n't disagree , but , if you look at the data , this is not what happened in this case . 
  what produce had a significant market in russia ( like dairy products and vegetables ) accrued significant year-on-year losses , losses which were offset by gains in exports for other produce . 
   the bans seem to be beneficial to our economy yes : they * seem * to . 
  correlation is not causation -- by itself , closing your access to an external market can not cause an increase in exports . 
  the point is so self-evident it 's almost not worth pointing out : all else being equal , when you have fewer people to sell to , you sell less . 
  something else must be driving the increase . 
  it 's propaganda . 
  the increase is not in any way positively affected by the russian sanctions . 
  it 's a correlational fluke ( the agricultural exports would have been even higher still without the sanctions , all else being equal ) , due to stronger demand in other ( non-russian ) markets . 
  as for what might be causing higher demand elsewhere , the reasons should vary widely , but lower oil prices are probably a big factor , since it lowers to transportation costs . 
  a weaker euro is another general factor that should have contributed to this increase in exports . 
  here 's just an example , [ straight from horse 's mouth ] ( http://dailykenn.blogspot.com.tr/2015/06/african-filmmaker-wants-white-colonists.html ) . 
  as for whatever grievances you have about the most extreme missteps of past european colonialism in africa , they can now be avoided , chiefly because europeans have a sense of obligation to right their mistakes . 
  and when i say that i 'm specifically referring to those who have a genuine inclination to do so , not people like you , who are steadfast only in a hypocritical , phoney moralism of inaction , wilful ignorance , and vacuous sermonising . 
  helping them where they are would be much more helpful , not just to us , as europeans , but more so to them , because it would create a proper environment in their own countries , instead of the sociocultural geopolitical ghetto/basket case that is today 's africa and the middle east . 
  you can not absorb economic migrants indefinitely . 
  these issues must be addressed . 
  standing in a corner and shouting `` racist '' does not address anything . 
   it was called colonisation . 
  and it worked . 
  * that * is the most important thing to keep in mind here , that neocolonialism is a viable solution . 
  the chinese are re-colonising africa anyway -- europeans could provide a more humane alternative to it . 
  the ministry of truth has declared that such opinions are crimethink . 
  fret not citizen , the megathreads will be here only temporarily , as the party is well on their way to devising a solution that will eradicate this insidiousness . 
  ignorance is strength . 
   an extremist does n't want to debate the other side , they want their opinion exposed to as many people as possible and reinforce it in an echo chamber . 
  it is amazing how self-unaware some people are . 
  a fine display of sanctimoniousness . 
  indeed : you 're trying your very best to avoid addressing my post directly . 
  this seems to be a recurring point of confusion , but [ guilt culture ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/guilt-culture ) is not the same thing as [ white guilt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_guilt ) , although i would say the latter is downstream from the former . 
  there is a difference between a factor playing a `` huge role '' and it playing the `` sole role '' in driving something . 
  there is an even bigger difference between a cluster of societies that has been in pronounced contact with christianity for only a little over two centuries , and one that has been under its yoke for a millennium and a half . 
  would n't you agree ? 
   he was talking specifically about anti-immigration views that people ( without cause ) claim to be racist . 
  again ? 
  it seem that you treat dishonesty as a personal prerogative . 
  although that is not at all irrelevant to what i 'm saying , it is , nonetheless , your own ( pointed ? ), 
  mischaracterisation , not what i am * specifically * talking about . 
  again : stop being so disingenuous . 
  you 're more concerned with shifting the frame and re-contextualising what i am stating instead of addressing it . 
  the fact that you never failed to make references to such views without attaching to them either some directly degrading epithets ( `` openly xenophobic '' , `` radical '' , `` fascist '' , `` racist '' ) or tongue in cheek ones ( `` far-right media darlings '' ) , is a point in support of my position , not against it . 
  there is a very clear asymmetry at work here . 
  these issues are not to be talked about in polite society , so they are framed accordingly . 
  i am taking a stab at why that might be so . 
  as for widespread , systemic censorship , my claim was that if things are to continue like this , it is ( inevitably ) on its way . 
  stop being so disingenuous . 
  it 's too obvious . 
  the fragment you quoted , you pulled out of context . 
  was i solely `` complaining '' about the state of the subreddit ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  that was just a side point . 
  a relevant side point at that , as i see it . 
  so please , cut the bulverism down a notch . 
   i do n't think it has anything to do with a `` guilt culture '' that 's quite ironic , because throughout your posts , you 're trying to frame the pro-immigration stance as some sort of moral duty or obligation , thereby proving * my point that this really is a guilt culture gone haywire . 
   foreigners are for exploitation in their home countries , not for treating like human beings . 
  or , in translation , feasibility and any other consequences be damned -- anyone who opposes immigration is a horrible human being , because the mere act of denying entry for these people is a direct assault on their moral worth as human beings . 
  see ? 
  * at least in your individual case, 
  i am talking about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guilt_society ) as opposed to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shame_society ) : the manner in which our societies function at their base , and how that base function has been , so to say , short-circuited in this case . 
  i was not trying to point out to a particular event that might cause a group to inculcate a feeling of guilt . 
  you can treat it as a quirk : europeans are prone to feel guilt , regardless of how warranted or not those feelings are . 
  to put it into context , for example , you do n't see the japanese beating themselves over their imperialist past ( or their actions in ww2 in particular ) to the same degree that european societies do .
