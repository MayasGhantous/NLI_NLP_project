lack of education and poverty . 
  it 's the same all over the world . 
  rich and educated people usually do not smoke . 
  i 'm clueless because you ca n't understand what i 'm saying ? 
  have a nice day . 
   you said that if one abides by `` everybody else does it '' then they are stupid . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i said that `` everybody else does it '' is `` the infection vector for stupidity '' . 
  that does n't mean that if `` everybody else does it '' they are stupid . 
  you assumed that yourself by generalizing . 
  i said that stupid people use the `` everybody else does it '' justification . 
  that does n't imply that `` everybody else that does it '' is stupid . 
  you assumed that by yourself and it 's a wrong assumption . 
  you should n't generalize . 
   you were  trying too hard to be witty and failed . 
  it 's ok . , 
  i never said that . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  that 's another infection vector for stupidity . 
   everybody else does it the infection vector for stupidity . 
  [ german budget surplus soars as economy motors ahead ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-gdp-iduskbn1620l3?il=0 )  germany has been running a surplus for three years . 
  soaring tax revenues , rising employment and low debt costs helped drive the gap higher to 23.7 billion euros ( $ 25 billion ) in 2016 . 
   but must eventually fall back again . 
  clearly , it will happen because you said so . 
   even though it 's been going on for over 3 years . 
  wait for it ... wait for it ... you just keep holding your breath . 
   it wo n't be . 
  germany 's economic engine is still running on the fumes from a now-empty tank , [ german budget surplus soars as economy motors ahead ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-gdp-iduskbn1620l3?il=0 )  germany has been running a surplus for three years .

  how about them apples ? 
   uber drivers can game the system in ways that taxi drivers can not , specifically by purchasing licenses in very small towns where they cost less and then using them in big cities . 
  uber drivers are not uber employees . 
  they pay to use the app . 
  if uber drivers are gaming the system , regulate uber drivers . 
  it 's not static and i 'm not a conservative . 
  that 's my point . 
  germany is doing great and is getting better . 
   german broadcast authority the landesmedienanstalt has ** temporarily ruled ** that live-streaming requires a broadcasting license , which costs between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 $ ** depending on the number of viewers ** , according to this reddit post . 
   the ruling has mainly been made to prevent tv and radio stations from billing themselves as streaming companies in order to avoid paying a broadcasting license . 
   it 's not yet clear whether german streamers will have to follow the exact same regulations that tv broadcasters do , but if so , they will have to follow at 10pm watershed . 
   however , the landesmedienanstalt did say that the guidelines are outdated , so the ruling may change in the near future . 
  it 's temporary and it only targets tv stations . 
  most people here have n't even read the article . 
  do n't taxi drivers have taxi apps in italy ? 
  it 's not like uber has a monopoly on bridging the gap between clients and customers . 
  if the future is anythig like the present , then it 's not too shabby . 
   i 'm an enthusiastic european . 
  in fact , i 'm about as europhile as you can get . 
  i 'm probably one of the few people left who likes the idea of a united states of europe . 
  this is when you say `` oh , really ? '' . 
   however , look at the small print and it says the `` free eu roaming '' is limited to 1gb , which is between 3pc and 10pc of its domestic data allowances . 
   to put this into context , 1gb of data is about half a day 's use of facebook , snapchat or instagram at best . 
  it 's utterly insufficient . 
  this is when you call bs . 
  i use less than 1.5 gb per month . 
   i love europe . 
  it 's a bastion of civilisation and , i think , part of the solution to the world 's problems rather than the cause . 
  but i ca n't be the only one to despair at the pathetic way in which it tries to sell half-cocked measures . 
  this is when you realize the guy does n't really love europe , but exaggerated headlines and drama . 
  there is also no source for any of the claims he made so people are supposed to take his word for it . 
  no , thanks .

  pathetic . 
  please refrain from insulting me . 
  thanks . 
    no , that 's a fact . 
  a fact that 's not only acknowledged by french historians but also american , french and other so we can leave the ` pride ' argument alone . 
  am i supposed to take your word for this ? 
  care to bring some arguments to support that ? 
  some articles saying how the french government from 1940 was illegitimate and when that happened ? 
   the former president jacques chirac and the current leader , fran\u00e7ois hollande , have both apologised for the role french police played in the corralling of more than 13,000 jews at the vel d\u2019hiv cycling track , which was ordered by nazi officers in 1942 . 
  but le pen told the lci television channel on sunday : `` i do n't think france is responsible for the vel d\u2019hiv . '' as far as i can tell , only lepen thinks this while the majority disagrees with her . 
   not important . 
  really ? 
  you said that 's why it is illegitimate . 
  so , which is it ? 
  it 's either not important or the turning point of history . 
  you are literally contradicting yourself now . 
   no , the vichy government and the constitutional change of 1940 was judged illegal . 
  you just said it was not important . 
  you are contradicting yourself , bro . 
    you 're ignoring my posts , not adressing to arguments and only repeating your stuff which i already answered to . 
  i 've already asked you what posts am i ignoring . 
  are you ignoring this ?
