  they are more prone to earthquake damage and are made from toxic materials . 
  they have outdated plumbing and old electrical systems that are often fire hazards . 
  your only reason for liking them is a subjective one : you find them pretty . 
  ultimately , you can live wherever you want . 
  but you do n't have the right to impose your preference upon others by saying that `` i do n't think we really need these ugly buildings that they 're putting up nowadays '' . 
  if you do n't need them , it does n't mean that others do n't . 
   paris somehow has a much higher population density than nyc with much fewer shitty tall buildings that 's because new york ( 1,213.37 km ^ 2 ) is a much bigger city than paris ( 105.4 km ^ 2 ) . 
  this is a bad comparison . 
  also , are you trying to say that having a bigger population density is a good thing ? 
  new york has a lower population density just because of the tall `` shitty '' buildings . 
  more people living in a tall building means that you need less of them . 
  that means that housing buildings take up less surface area and that allows for the development of other structures and services like office buildings , roads , public transportation , parks , entertainment and cultural buildings , etc. . that leads to less people living per square kilometer , which is a good thing . 
   nobody wants to live in a crowded city . 
  people need places to live . 
  cheap and tall buildings are a natural evolution from the growth of population . 
  you also need to keep in mind that not everyone could afford to live in those beautiful buildings in the center of the city . 
  most people lived in slums at the edge of the city . 
  and they were much more ugly and the living conditions were almost non-existent . 
  most people you see in this video are either part of the rich elite of the time or away from the places they called `` home '' . 
  you do n't see these places in this film . 
  keep that in mind when making `` post-modernist or socialist statements of ugliness , brutalism and blandness '' . 
  i 'll take `` blandness '' over the lack of basic sanitation every day . 
  and i 'm pretty sure you 'd make the same choice provided that you were not part of the privileged few . 
   it took v4 6 years to enter eu and they all were in much much better shape pretty much all of eastern europe has a 50 + year old communist legacy that involved a de facto russian occupation . 
  you ca n't just shake that off in a few years . 
  ukraine , especially , is having a hard time because russia literally invaded them and annexed part of their territory . 
  it 's going to be especially hard for them to join the eu and nato because russia does n't want them to do that . 
  russia has openly admitted to ignore all basic human rights and the sovereignty of other neighboring states if it 's in their interest to do so . 
  it 's going to be a long and bumpy road , but it 's only a matter of time until ukraine joins the eu . 
   because nobody could take that from your original statement or follow-ups up to that point . 
  you ignored it right after i wrote it in my previous comment , bro . 
  i had to copy & paste it in my follow-up to that comment because you were ignoring it . 
   yeah mate in that sentence the thing referred to as `` this shit '' really is you . 
  thanks for the insult . 
  it really contributes a lot to this discussion . 
  :| this discussion is over . 
   `` oh you do n't want to ? 
  well then ... ''  sick pressure you 're ignoring the fact that  an attempt by the european commission to aim for a slightly expansionary fiscal policy for the euro zone as a whole this year was met by german opposition and was eventually dropped . 
  and , instead of giving up , they 're keeping up the pressure . 
  this is not the first time this `` news '' has been discussed . 
  germany has had a budget surplus for over 3 years . 
  you ca n't expect the eu to dictate how they 're supposed to spend that money . 
  that 's what nationalists accuse the eu of doing . 
  on the other side there 's people like you that claim the eu is n't putting enough pressure on germany . 
  really ? 
  whatever the eu would do or not do , there will always be haters . 
  it 's germany 's business what they do with their money . 
  the eu can ask them to help other countries , but that 's about it . 
  if germany refuses to make further spending , that 's their decision . 
  the eu can not interfere , otherwise you 'd be calling the eu out for not minding its own business . 
   that 's the contention . 
  the operation 's goal ( as far as we know ) was not to stop the protest per se . 
  below from the wikipedia article . 
   eventually prime minister laurent fabius admitted the bombing had been ** a french plot ** : on 22 september 1985 , he summoned journalists to his office to read a 200-word statement in which he said : `` the truth is cruel , '' and acknowledged there had been a cover-up ; he went on to say that `` agents of the french secret service sank this boat . 
  ** they were acting on orders . 
  ** '' i 'm pretty sure that acting on orders means intent . 
   ironically , wikipedia does say that the french government first reaction after the bombing was ... to qualify it as an act of terrorism . 
  they were projecting . 
   i did not say you said they are the same i said you were comparing them . 
  i was not comparing them . 
  i never said that was one more despicable than the other . 
  you did that . 
  `` i said that this puts those assassinations into a different perspective , meaning that if even a western country like france would do such a thing as to sink a greenpeace ship to prevent it from protesting , just imagine what other countries would do . '', 
  why did you ignore this part ? 
   `` this shit would be really interesting if we were n't right in the middle of it . '', 
  no shit . 
  because it is n't one . 
  it 's an expression with non of the meaning you attach to it . 
  sorry , bro , but that 's different . 
  when you say to someone that they `` do n't understand this shit '' , you 're clearly mean it as an insult towards them . 
  you did n't say that `` we 're in this shit together '' . 
   to prevent it from blocking nuclear tests . 
  again , you 're trying to somehow justify the murder of an innocent person . 
  if they wanted to prevent it , and they actually cared about human life , they could have done a number of other things that did n't involve the detonation of explosive devices . 
  you 're defending murderers . 
   one tries to stop a protest group from getting into the blastradius of a nuke , their method leads to manslaughter . 
  because stopping the nuke test was impossible , right ? 
  it 's not like they were the ones doing it , right ? 
   they would have just let them leave port and detonate the bomb regardless of the protestors in the area . 
  yeah , but they did n't do that . 
  the whole thing was covert . 
  they even denied responsibility at first . 
  how considerate of them . 
   anyway the whole point of this discussion boiled down to people trying to point you at the notable difference between manslaughter and murder . 
  it 's there for a reason . 
  it 's intent , right ? 
  ** the french government was willing to kill innocent people in order to prevent a greenpeace protest . 
  that was their intent . 
  ** it was n't an accident . 
   weird because the court in auckland , new zealand seems to have agreed with me now did n't it . 
  they got charged with manslaughter not murder how nice of them . 
   they have different terms for those things with different legal connotations and generally consequences . 
  weird ai n't it . 
  since you 're debating the semantics of manslaughter , you need to remember that  the definition of [ manslaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manslaughter ) differs among legal jurisdictions . 
  you 're also ignoring everything that happened afterwards . 
   eventually prime minister laurent fabius admitted the bombing had been ** a french plot ** : on 22 september 1985 , he summoned journalists to his office to read a 200-word statement in which he said : `` the truth is cruel , '' and acknowledged there had been a cover-up ; he went on to say that `` agents of the french secret service sank this boat . 
  ** they were acting on orders . 
  ** '' since when does acting on orders mean intent ? 
  a lot of people here are trying to diminish the gravity of this incident by saying that there was no intent to kill someone . 
  do you think the french government knew people could die ?
