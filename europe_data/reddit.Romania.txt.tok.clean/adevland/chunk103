  i 'm pretty sure they did . 
  yet they went ahead with the bombing , regardless . 
  it 's not an assassination and it 's not a terrorist attack , but it proves that ** the french government was willing to kill innocent people in order to prevent a greenpeace protest ** . 
  it 's a fine line between that and flat-out pointing a gun to someone 's head and pulling the trigger . 
  you can also argue that those bombs had the potential to kill even more people just like how terror attacks are meant to do . 
  and you can say that assassinations target specific people and rarely have collateral damage . 
  ** you ca n't claim that one is more despicable than the other . 
  if you do this , you 're just taking sides with one of the killers . 
  ** do you defend terrorists that have their attacks stopped just in time by saying that they did n't really do any harm ? 
  no , you do n't . 
  do you defend assassins by saying that they did n't meant for any collateral damage ? 
  no , you do n't . 
  you do n't do this because they had intent , right ? 
  the french government was willing to kill innocent people in order to prevent a greenpeace protest . 
  that was their ** intent ** . 
  ** someone died because bombs were willingly detonated by people that knew they could be killing other people . 
  ** they did this willingly . 
  ** and they did it to stop a friggin protest . 
   as a sidenote , i get that reddit is passionate about this but it ca n't be called a `` terrorist attack '' . 
  not only because there was no intent to kill or because the sinking was supposed to be shown as an incident . 
  do you think the french government knew people could die ?

   it refers to the intent . 
  you know which might be important when you try and compare it to russian political assassinations . 
  you know as in the comment he was replying to , the damn context . 
  i never said it was the same as the russian assassinations . 
  why are you even assuming this ? 
  i said that this puts those assassinations into a different perspective , meaning that if even a western country like france would do such a thing as to sink a greenpeace ship to prevent it from protesting , just imagine what other countries would do . 
  that was the point . 
   oh god please . 
  with shit i 'm not comparing anything to literal shit . 
  it 's an expression . 
  a derogatory one . 
  it was either meant to insult me or the event itself . 
   idk mate i think someone is pretty vulnerable and exposed to the risk of dying when you place bombs in the ship he is or was on .

   why are you telling me this . 
  nobody in this comment-chain contradicted that . 
  / u/10ebbor10 said that  pereira was not supposed to die though . 
   pereira went back to take pictures of the damage . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mdx0r/never_forget_on_this_day_in_1985_the_french/dk156ei/ what 's the purpose of that comment ? 
  how does `` he was not supposed to die '' change the fact that he did ? 
  this only implies the alleviation of guilt from those responsible . 
  what other meaning is there to that comment ? 
   honestly with the way shit flies over your head it 's not shit , bro . 
  the death of a person is n't shit . 
  that guy died doing his job . 
  he died because of a bomb detonated by a western government in a covert operation to sink a greepeace ship in order to stop it from protesting . 
  this is as serious as can be . 
  it 's not `` shit '' . 
   did you have the same intent as putting a gun to that persons head and pulling the trigger ? 
  probably not . 
  this analogy only makes sense if you knew the guy was vulnerable and could have died . 
  you took a risk knowing that someone could die . 
  that 's intent . 
   i 'm not trying to diminish their guilth . 
  i 'm just saying they did not go out to kill they knew people could die . 
  that 's intent . 
  they sunk a boat to prevent a protest even though they knew people could die . 
  they did it knowingly . 
  i 'm curious as to how they were identified as being left wing radicals . 
  as far as i 've seen there is just footage of masked people looting , throwing rocks and setting cars ablaze . 
  the whole idea that they are left wing radicals is based solely on the fact that g20 happened in the same time and place . 
  is there any other evidence ? 
  did they protest against anything ? 
  did they have any signs or messages ? 
  the only messages i 've seen are anti-capitalist . 
  how is that a left-wing only idea ?
