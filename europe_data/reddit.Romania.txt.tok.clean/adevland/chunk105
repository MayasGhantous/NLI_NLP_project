   sources close to the crimean project have previously told reuters that one of the options under consideration was to use the taman turbines in crimea . 
   asked about that possibility last year , siemens said it was supplying the turbines ** only for use in taman , and not in crimea ** . 
  and even if they were lying , you ca n't blame the eu for what private companies decide to do . 
  if they broke the law , they will be fined . 
  so far it 's unclear who brought them from taman to crimea . 
   my assumption is that siemens sold them and got money for them . 
  i think it 's quite safe assumption . 
  siemens sold them to russia in order to be used in taman . 
  then some were relocated by russia from taman to crimea . 
  you 're assuming siemens delivered them . 
   `` siemens has not delivered turbines to crimea and complies with all export control restrictions , '' said wolfram trost , a spokesman for siemens in munich , when asked to confirm the turbine transfer to crimea . 
  the more plausible assumption is that russia took some siemens turbines that were supposed to be used in taman and sent them to crimea . 
   russia needs the turbines for two crimean power plants the kremlin wants to get up and running to fulfill a promise , made by president vladimir putin , to ensure a stable power supply for the region 's residents after it was annexed by moscow from ukraine in 2014 . 
   delivery of the turbines , intended for the two new power stations under construction , had been delayed for over a year because the firms involved feared violating eu sanctions , people involved in the project have told reuters . 
  you can also argue that this is intentional as to make the eu look bad for the next russian presidential elections . 
  read the whole article . 
   one source close to the project , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic , told reuters that two of the turbines had been ** delivered from russia by sea to crimea ** . 
   the individual close to the project and the official in the crimea energy sector told reuters the turbines delivered to the port in sevastopol had come from taman , located in southern russia , some 10 miles ( 16 km ) from crimea . 
   siemens told reporters in march that a russian joint venture in which it has a majority stake supplied turbines for use in a power plant that was planned for construction in taman . 
  i just posted to see my flair . 
  needs more cunts, 
   as i read it , your post implied that there is a norm in the west of protecting hate speech through free speech . 
  what ? 
  definitely not . 
   when a grandma in the western world states that she does not like how her gypsy neighbors because they play loud music into the evening hours sometimes , that is free speech . 
  obviously . 
  / u/chuckcarmichael explains it very well . 
   why do foreign journalists always translate volksverhetzung wrong ? 
  it 's not hate speech , it 's incitement of the people . 
  you can write `` refugees are assholes '' and nobody cares . 
  you write `` refugees should get out of this country '' and nobody cares . 
  you can even write `` i hate those muslim goatfuckers '' and nobody cares . 
  but you write `` we should burn down refugee homes and club those fuckers to death '' and now it 's stuff that the german government wants controlled . 
  you write `` somebody should gas those people , do a second holocaust with them '' and now it 's incitement of the people . 
  when an entity like isis does it , it 's clearly hate speech . 
  when the western world does it , it 's free speech . 
  your rights end where the rights of others begin . 
  and everyone has equal rights . 
   `` europe is n't a supermarket . 
  europe is a common destiny . 
  it is weakened when it accepts its principles being rejected . 
  the countries in europe that do n't respect the rules should have to face the political consequences . 
  and that 's not just an east-west debate . '' this is about the likes of orban from hungary that literally uses eu funds to pay for anti-eu propaganda and legislation that goes against the eu principles . 
  it 's not about immigrant workers as people here seem to think .

  the world really needed a lesson in practical stupidity . 
  we 're still taking notes . 
  we see you , turkey , do n't worry . 
   `` we believe that these subjects are beyond their [ students ] comprehension , '' said durmu\u015f in a video published on the education ministry 's website . 
   the subject of evolution in particular stirred debate earlier this year after numan kurtulmu\u015f , the deputy prime minister , described the process as a theory that was both archaic and lacking sufficient evidence . 
   reports in turkish media in recent weeks , based on apparent leaks of school board meetings , have also predicted a diminished role in the curriculum for the study of atat\u00fcrk , and an increase in the hours devoted to studying religion . 
  tl ; dr : kids do not understand this notion which is archaic and unproven . 
  we 'll replace it with the study of religion because it is n't archaic and it 's proven . 
  makes sense , right ? 
  / s north korea is taking notes from turkey . 
  what 's happening now is the real coup . 
   or ... you could use precise language without resorting to hyperbolic and demonstrably false terms such as ` exodus ' to fit your narrative ? 
  dude , [ that 's not my `` narrative '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6iryz0/from_le_monde_254_surge_in_britons_seeking_french/dj8m835/ ) . 
  the article revealed a trend and the immediate reaction was to dismiss an inner fear about an `` exodus '' that was n't even mentioned in the article . 
  my point is that it 's not ok to `` ignore it until it actually becomes a problem '' . 
  i did n't come up with the `` narrative '' . 
  i just commented on it . 
  that 's it . 
  so ... nothing from the sun ? 
  site is down . 
   this page is n't working is a very accurate description of brexit . 
   is not done via a thorough knowledge of the human body , but by tests and statistics the court di n't base its decision on tests and statistics . 
  the tests and statistics contradict their decision . 
  also , those tests and statistics are n't just correlated events . 
  they 're held in controlled circumstances . 
  the court knew little to nothing about what happened in that particular case and it ignored the tests and statistics that were especially made to ensure the safety of the patients . 
   the case was brought before the court of appeal in france , which ruled that there was no scientific consensus supporting a causal link and no evidence of a causal link between the hepatitis b vaccine and the man 's multiple sclerosis , therefore dismissing the action . 
   the court of justice said that `` specific and consistent evidence '' ** relating to timeliness ** , a prior healthy status , lack of family history and multiple cases may prove to be enough , according to a statement . 
  tl ; dr : ** coincidences are now grounds for lawsuits . 
  ** this is a very dangerous precedent . 
  someone fucked up . 
  big-time . 
  we know little about how vaccines interact with people , but we also know little about how diseases manifest themselves . 
  the court chose one uncertainty over the other as being truth . 
   you brought the idea of an exodus up in the first place . 
  actually , [ i did n't ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6iryz0/from_le_monde_254_surge_in_britons_seeking_french/dj8m835/ ) . 
  ** the article revealed a trend and the immediate reaction was to dismiss an inner fear about an `` exodus '' that was n't even mentioned in the article . 
  ** people instinctively know this is a problem and refute it without it even being mentioned . 
  it 's like saying that snoop dogg sucks in a discussion about justin bieber 's latest rap album . 
  it 's choice supportive bias . 
   no , it was to challenge your narrative that people were leaving britain for the mainlands in their droves dude , that 's not my idea . 
  i replied to someone who mentioned , on their own , that this `` exodus '' happening . 
  there was no other mention of an `` exodus '' up until then . 
  ** my point is that it 's not ok to `` ignore it until it actually becomes a problem '' . 
   i honestly do n't understand why removing assad became priority for anyone apart from isis at all . 
  what else are all those troops going to do after isis is defeated ? 
  go home ?
