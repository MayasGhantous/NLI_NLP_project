   the strange death of europe is a highly personal account of a continent and culture caught in the act of suicide . 
  it fear-mongers immigration , while ignoring everything else . 
  it acts as if these are eu specific problems . 
  they are n't . 
  you can actually argue that the eu could have done worse at dealing with immigration because , despite of this , the eu economy has beaten the us and it 's only getting better . 
  the article and book ignore this and falsely present the eu as being in bankruptcy . 
  the article paints the eu as the failing state that could n't or would n't care about its people while it 's exactly the opposite of this . 
  why is this so ? 
  because look at everybody else . 
  the us also has immigration problems as well as a different way of dealing with it . 
  and the results are also different . 
  the eu economy has beaten the us economy . 
  that 's the point . 
   and this kind of immigration is n't going to worsen those services ? 
  it 's been a few years now since the immigrant crisis started and the services are still working . 
  not only can the eu economy handle it , but it 's also thriving . 
  [ eurozone economy quietly outshines the us ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0bbc026a-ea12-11e6-967b-c88452263daf ), 
  there 's also healthcare and education . 
  the us sucks at all of these when compared with the eu . 
  you might be thinking : but the eu is commiting `` suicide '' because immigrants .

  despite all of this , the [ eurozone economy quietly outshines the us ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0bbc026a-ea12-11e6-967b-c88452263daf ) . 
  consider this : most eu countries are already members of nato and they contribute with assets and logistics to nato . 
  who 's to say that the same assets can not be used for an eu version of nato . 
  it would be a part-time army . 
  when nato needs it , it goes to nato . 
  when the eu needs it , it goes to the eu . 
  there would be little overlaps since most eu countries are already nato members and can easily coordinate .

   this means nothing . 
  it 's only the tip of the iceberg . 
   `` we have begun to shift funds to frankfurt ** and other european cities ** , '' says gnodde . 
  he added that the number of employees in frankfurt , the financial heart of germany , is likely to double . 
  now there are about two hundred . 
  goldman sachs is not the only company to do this . 
   reddit is in no way representative of the voting public . 
  most people on reddit are against brexit and pro eu . 
  this has n't always been the case . 
  the opinion has shifted along with the polls . 
  before brexit , the eu skepticism was prevalent . 
  after brexit , it started shifting to where we are today . 
   here u go jennifer : it 's out of context , bro . 
  you still misinterpret what i said . 
  yes , a majority of brits fell for the tabloid propaganda and because of that they voted for brexit . 
   you still claim it was the only reason . 
  i never said that . 
  you left out the first part . 
  you keep misinterpreting my words and making assumptions on my behalf . 
  you 're clearly ill intent and taking this personally . 
   honey you ca n't link me to a news article that says all romanians do n't eat human flesh i do n't have to prove your idea . 
  that 's your job . 
  accusations without proof are only slander . 
  have you ever heard of innocent until proven guilty ? 
  you either prove your accusation or do n't . 
  so far you 've brought only insults to this discussion . 
  no facts , articles or sources for anything you 've said . 
   you made the claim that `` a majority of brits fell for the anti eu tabloid propaganda '' so link me to an article that actually proves it , the burden of proof is on you well , there 's the nyt article , but you do n't like that one because the nyt is not british , am i right ?

  [ brexit vote is a big win for british tabloids ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/24/media/brexit-british-newspapers/index.html )  a study released last month by the reuters institute for the study of journalism found that , of 928 articles on the referendum , 45 % were in favor of leaving , while only 27 % were in favor of remaining . 
  the other stories were considered to be neutral or mixed .

  [ debunking years of tabloid claims about europe ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/06/daily-chart-15 )  i 'm not the one making wild claims about the citizens of other countries , so do n't even try to pull the victim card these are not wild claims . 
  these are well documented aspects of british society . 
  i know it 's not something to be proud of , but denying it is n't going to make tabloids go away . 
   it is n't xenophobic or prejudiced to say that the citizens of a country know it better than someone who does n't live there when you insult someone and deny everything they say , even if it 's backed up by arguments , polls and studies then , yes , it 's highly xenophobic and a huge dick move . 
  you 're basically on a high pedestal dismissing everything people say on the basis that they are foreign . 
  that 's text-book xenophobia . 
   xenophobia : dislike of or ** prejudice ** against people from other countries . 
  when i say that a majority of brits fell for tabloid propaganda and voted `` leave '' , i say it because it 's a well documented fact . 
  see all the above articles about it . 
  i do n't say it out of malice or ignorance . 
  when you insult me , that 's pure malice . 
   and that was why they voted for brexit you still claim it was the only reason . 
  i never said that . 
  ** why do you keep making assumptions on my behalf ? 
  **  then changed it to sensationalist journalism in general and then said that it is n't a majority of britons tabloids are sensationalist journalism . 
  i never said it was the only reason for brexit . 
  i said that a majority of brits read tabloids and are influenced by them and that the brexit vote proves this . 
  the nyt article says the same thing . 
  that lots of brits were influenced by tabloid propaganda to vote `` leave '' . 
  i never switched my arguments . 
  you are the one making wrong assumptions on my behalf . 
   an article can not be a tabloid ( that does n't even make sense grammatically ) but it can be sensationalist an article can be tabloid journalism . 
  all printed tabloids also have online versions of most of their articles , especially the anti eu ones . 
  why are you still arguing this ? 
  it 's a petty argument you 've lost . 
   in the article , the editor of the sun literally says that tabloids did not cause brexit holy shit !, 
  tabloids claim tabloids did not influence brexit . 
  shocking !, 
  it must be true because an editor from the sun sais it !, 
  what 's next ? 
  putin denying russian interference in us elections ? 
   so if i found an article that said romanians eat human flesh , you would n't expect me to believe it was n't true because you live there and are embedded in the culture ?
