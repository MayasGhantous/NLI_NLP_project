  unlike you , i do n't make assumptions . 
  i 'd expect you to prove it with facts and not with an article you did n't even link to this discussion . 
  ** you keep making assuptions on my behalf , ignore reputable article from publications like the nyt while failing to provide any real facts to prove your ideas while also insulting me . 
  ** yet you 're right because i 'm a foreigner and my opinion does n't matter . 
  ** you 're filled with xenophobia and prejudice . 
  they just had to not pick bernie . 
   if your opinion is nonsense , people are going to point that out and they 're not going to apologise for that being a dick about it does n't really help them prove their point . 
  insults are n't arguments . 
  you somehow fail to understand this and think it 's ok . 
  it is n't . 
   you do n't have to continually keep moving the goalposts , you can just admit that your original statement was incorrect how did i move the goalpost ? 
  you 're frantically trying to disprove the nyt article without actually bringing any arguments . 
  you 're only insulting me by saying my opinion has no weight because i 'm a foreigner , even though the nyt agrees . 
  you even tried to debate the semantics of the word `` tabloid '' by saying that online articles can not be classified as tabloids , which is false according to wikipedia . 
  you then listed 2 tabloids as not being tabloids , even though they are described as such on wikipedia . 
   this is literally the third time i 've had to say that correlation does not mean causation i 've already argumented it via the nyt article which correlates brexit to tabloids . 
   it does n't mean that just because brexit passed it must be because people are reading and believing tabloid newspapers no , it 's the other way around . 
  brexit happened as a result of a lot of factors , one of them being the influence of fake news articles and propaganda in tabloid publications in the uk . 
  both in print and online . 
  ** you 've failed to disprove the nyt article and you 've brought no evidence of your own ** other than `` i know better because i live in the uk '' . 
   go to any youtube video of boris johnson , any comment section on a news article , any political tv show , any satirical news outlet it 's not my job to prove your points . 
  if you wo n't prove them , nobody will . 
   i gave them as examples of tabloids , learn to read now who 's shifting goal posts ? 
   there are very few online sources that ** could be described as propaganda that are not the tabloids ** you were previously discussing ( ie , the sun , the daily mail , etc ) those are [ your words ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hkvn1/europeans_like_the_eu_more_since_brexit_even_the/dizfxno/ ) . 
  you said the sun and the daily mail can be described as propaganda but are not tabloids and are part of `` very few '' such publications . 
   it 's easy to pinpoint singular causes , but i doubt any are enough to explain the actual cause of the crisis . 
  people usually ignore the pre-existing factors from before the 2008 crisis . 
   the [ greek government-debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis ) ( also known as the greek depression ) is the sovereign debt crisis faced by greece in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 . 
  the greek crisis started in late 2009 , triggered by the turmoil of the great recession , structural weaknesses in the greek economy , and revelations that ** previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been undercounted by the greek government ** . 
   which is bullshit , obviously the nyt disagrees . 
    if you did n't post bollocks , you would n't have people replying to you saying that you do n't know what you 're talking about i have the right to express my opinion . 
  that does n't give anyone the right to insult me . 
  i 've also argumented my opinions while others only insult me . 
   tabloids and fake news websites still are not solely responsible for brexit i never said they are the sole reason . 
  this is the third time i 've asked you not to assume things on my behalf . 
   but the number of people who take boris johnson 's opinions seriously are dwarfed by the number of people who see him as hignfy or mtw fodder the nyt disagrees . 
  the brexit vote proves it . 
  what arguments do you have besides the fact that you claim to live in the uk ? 
   i love how you have to exaggerate several newspapers into ` so many variants ' you said that the sun and daily mail are n't tabloids . 
   there are very few online sources that could be described as propaganda that are not the tabloids you were previously discussing ( ie , the sun , the daily mail , etc ) they are . 
   [ the sun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sun_\\ ( united_kingdom \\ ) ) is a ** tabloid ** newspaper published in the united kingdom and ireland . 
   [ the daily mail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daily_mail ) is a british daily middle-market ** tabloid ** newspaper owned by the daily mail and general trust and published in london . 
   yeah , if only your press would teach you to respect other countries and not piss/sleep on war memorials ... maybe one day eh by being a xenophone , you 're only proving my point . 
   in this post alone you 've said that britain is fearful and hateful of the eu i said that tabloid propaganda capitalizes on fear and hate . 
  please do not take my words out of context . 
   i know exactly how much you know about brexit : jack shit seriously , why are you being so negative towards me ? 
  what did i do to you ? 
   no , it ca n't be a tabloid unless it 's in physical print because a tabloid is a newspaper printing format you ignored the wikipedia article about tabloid journalism . 
  mirror co uk even markets itself as  mirror online : the intelligent tabloid . 
  #madeuthink you 're grasping for straws . 
    there are very few online sources that could be described as propaganda that are not the tabloids you were previously discussing ( ie , the sun , the daily mail , etc ) lol . 
  if you eliminate all the tabloids , there are no tabloids . 
  great logic , bro . 
   )  this again proves that you do n't know anything about british politics because boris johnson is the first port of call for political satirists and is maybe the best example of irrelevant joke politicians in the uk yep . 
  people joke about him while others take him seriously . 
  read the nyt article . 
  it goes in great depth at describing the tabloid culture in the uk . 
  if these publications are so ridiculed , then why are they still around and in so many variants ? 
  it 's not just one publications . 
  there are dozens . 
   ( ie , the sun , the daily mail , etc ) you do n't even know them all , although you claim to know more than i do . 
  feel free to ridicule and ignore them . 
  what harm can they do , right ? 
   by forbes  come on dude really ? 
  how about the bbc ? 
   [ eight reasons leave won the uk 's referendum on the eu ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36574526 )  2 . 
  # 350m nhs claim gets traction  the assertion that leaving the eu would free up # 350m a week extra to spend on the nhs is the kind of political slogan that campaigns dream of : striking , easy to understand and attractive to voters of different ages and political persuasions . 
   the fact that the claim does not stand up to much scrutiny - the figure is calculated using sums which were disputed by the treasury select committee and described as potentially misleading by the uk statistics authority - did not reduce its potency . 
  or do you prefer the more subtle articles from the sun 13th june 2016 : `` we urge our readers to beleave in britain and vote to quit the eu on june 23 ''  we must set ourselves free from dictatorial brussels . 
  these actually had the biggest impact . 
  [ to understand ` brexit , ' look to britain 's tabloids ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/london-tabloids-brexit.html )  a correspondent in brussels for the daily telegraph in the early 1990s , mr. johnson was credited by fellow reporters with pioneering the euroskeptic coverage of the european union that has since become the default setting for much of the british press . 
  with little regard for the truth -- he was previously fired by the times of london for making up a quote -- mr. johnson wrote about a europe scheming to impose standard condom sizes and ban his country 's beloved prawn-cocktail-flavored chips ( both untrue ) . 
   `` boris invented fake news , '' said martin fletcher , a former foreign editor of the times , who was in brussels shortly after mr. johnson . 
  `` he turned euroskepticism into an art form that every news editor in london came to expect . '', 
   it 's not all fake though is it mate  i 'm sure tabloid press is `` true '' to a lot of brits . 
  that was my point all along . 
   the tories will scapegoat the eu for the consequences leaving the eu was a mistake ? 
  it 's clearly the eu 's fault that we left the eu . 
   like we 're supposed to take yours ? 
  i actually support them with arguments and facts . 
  instead of fighting them with your own , the best you can do is say i 'm wrong and insult me . 
   putting ''  '' throughout the entirety of your comments make you looks incredibly immature and insulting me for a smiley face is really mature , right ? 
    your flair makes it all the more hilarious , frankly . 
  no , i wo n't be replying to you . 
  so you think i 'm immature and should be insulted because of my romanian flag flair ? 
  thanks for proving my point . 
   that would be much appreciated - obviously it 's all true if the tabloids say so , you 're all roma gypsy right ? 
  you 're making fun of tabloids for spreading fake news . 
  this is exactly my point .

  a lot of people do not ignore them . 
   that 's really not an unreasonable thing to say it 's an assumption based on a stereotype . 
  you have no idea how much i know about brexit . 
   i do n't comment on other nation 's politics very often , but if somebody from that country was to say `` no , you have that wrong '' i would listen to them that 's your problem . 
  you really should n't believe anything you read on the internet without fact-checking it yourself . 
   the bbc is n't a newspaper and therefore ca n't be a tabloid so , a publication ca n't spread lies unless they are in physical print ? 
  good to know .
