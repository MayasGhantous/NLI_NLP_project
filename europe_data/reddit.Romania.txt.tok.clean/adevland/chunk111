  / s i also never said it was . 
  i asked you if you thought it was . 
  please stop assuming things on my behalf . 
   if it does have a paragraph that says or implies that then please screenshot it or archive it at this point you 're debating semantics . 
  we both know there are hundreds of anti eu propaganda articles out there . 
  in print and online . 
  are you seriously dismissing the online articles as not being tabloids because they are not in print ? 
  debating semantics is the bottom of the barrel for any argument . 
   but i 'll humor you because you 're wrong . 
  [ tabloid journalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tabloid_journalism ) is n't restricted only to print . 
  that 's a desperate argument on your part . 
   tabloid journalism is a style of journalism that emphasizes sensational crime stories , gossip columns about celebrities and sports stars , junk food news and astrology . 
  ... .  i said that you 're implying that british people are mostly blithering idiots who voted based on years of le tabloid propaganda the tabloid part influencing them is true . 
  i never said it was the only reason . 
  congrats for ignoring the nyt article . 
  here it is again in case you missed it . 
  [ to understand ` brexit , ' look to britain 's tabloids ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/london-tabloids-brexit.html )  a correspondent in brussels for the daily telegraph in the early 1990s , mr. johnson was credited by fellow reporters with pioneering the euroskeptic coverage of the european union that has since become the default setting for much of the british press . 
  with little regard for the truth -- he was previously fired by the times of london for making up a quote -- mr. johnson wrote about a europe scheming to impose standard condom sizes and ban his country 's beloved prawn-cocktail-flavored chips ( both untrue ) . 
   `` boris invented fake news , '' said martin fletcher , a former foreign editor of the times , who was in brussels shortly after mr. johnson . 
  `` he turned euroskepticism into an art form that every news editor in london came to expect . '' ... ... ... ... .  then your response was that tabloids are saying that tabloid readers are blithering idiots i never called anyone that . 
  those are your words . 
  please stop assuming things on my behalf . 
   not remotely true . 
  why not ? 
   are we supposed to take your word for it . 
   51 % it 's actually 54 % . 
   the pew research center survey released thursday found that people in nine out of the 10 e.u. 
  member states polled hold a favorable view of the brussels-based institution . 
  that finding in pew 's latest global attitudes survey includes ** people in the u.k. , where 54 % view the e.u. 
  favorably ** , up 10 points from a similar poll the year before . 
  ...  stop being a dick , you really are n't coming off well , just smug . 
  so i 'm being a dick for stating poll results and commenting on people that insult me ? 
   you 're not the brightest bulb are you insulting me wo n't prove your point , bro . 
   nah , you 're just passive aggressive . 
  it 's hard not to be , given all the insults i 'm receiving . 
  that 's how you really make your point heard . 
  by insulting other people . 
  / s this is also passive aggressive , i know . 
   it also makes a point that insults do not help . 
  on the contrary . 
  cheers . 
   and what are the unemployment levels in southern europe ? 
  they 're actually getting better . 
  here 's greece : https://tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate and spain : https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/unemployment-rate, 
   correlation does not imply causation , there is no evidence that tabloid newspapers are the sole reason ( or even a significant one ) why the uk voted to leave the eu politicians like nigel farage really did most of the `` heavy lifting '' . 
  tabloids just cheered them on . 
  you got me there . 
    it is n't conjecture to say that british people know more about their political climate than you do tl ; dr : you 're a foreigner . 
  we know more than you do . 
   conjecture means an opinion based on incorrect or incomplete information tl ; dr : we know more than you do . 
  we have all the information !, 
  so brits know more about the uk , but they still voted for brexit . 
  okay . 
    i 'm starting to lose faith that you 've done anything more than just glance at the covers page of the bbc website did you just call the bbc a tabloid ? 
   )  without actually reading any of them or understanding the context in which they were published ? 
  you got me there . 
  british people really know more about uk tabloids than i do . 
   guess what ? 
  that was my point all along . 
  :d  if you can find me a single tabloid that ran an article saying that britain 's economic or social future was going in a different direction to the one planned by the european union i 'll actually believe that you know what a tabloid is this is n't really a daunting task . 
   / r/europe rules do not allow me to post this , so search the sun on 13th june 2016 : ** we urge our readers to beleave in britain and vote to quit the eu on june 23 **  we must set ourselves free from dictatorial brussels . 
  top notch uk journalism right there . 
  / s  there is absolutely no evidence at all that tabloids are either partially or wholly responsible for how british people voted [ to understand ` brexit , ' look to britain 's tabloids ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/london-tabloids-brexit.html )  did somebody say they were ? 
  can you read ? 
  you 're using them , mate . 
  and they do n't help in proving your point . 
  on the contrary . 
  this discussion is over . 
   every single line you just wrote is incorrect because you say so ? 
   you 're either a brilliant troll or an ** utter moron ** thanks for the kind words . 
  they really help you prove your point . 
   the polls actually were fake , as in , non-existent , cool bro , you 're taking things out of context , which is exactly what tabloid propaganda does on a regular basis . 
  you did n't even bother to read the article , but you 're here making fun of it . 
   i did , and i 'm telling you what you what you claim is n't there you previously said that [ you did n't ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hkvn1/europeans_like_the_eu_more_since_brexit_even_the/diz9qt3/ ) . 
  i 'm glad that you finally did . 
  either way , am i supposed to take your word for it ? 
  you could have brought arguments against it , but you did n't . 
  you still can . 
   tbh , the eu must evolve . 
  i agree . 
  this should always be the case . 
  and it is . 
  the problem with most is that it 's happening slower than they wanted . 
   brexit had forced countries to think about life outside the eu and for most , it lacks attraction . 
  [ leading by example . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/57njs3vun9wy.png )  ), 
   which is conjecture why ? 
  because the brexit vote agreed with the uk tabloid propaganda and followed through with the leave vote that was pushed in them ? 
  that 's not conjecture , bro . 
  that 's a fact . 
   if people are telling you that your theories are incorrect , they 're doing it because they know more about their country than you do lol . 
  now this is conjecture . 
   )  do you seriously think that most british people ` fear and hate ' the eu ? 
  and that rupert murdoch is the one who made that happen ?? 
  piss off no , bro . 
  i really get a warm and loving energy from you when you 're telling me to `` piss off '' . 
    there are a plethora of reasons to leave the eu , the most common of which was that british interests simply do n't run parallel with eu interests funny . 
  the uk tabloids said the same thing . 
   not everyone with a different opinion to you is a small-minded blithering idiot and neither are ' a majority of brits ' i do n't recall calling anyone a `` a small-minded blithering idiot '' . 
  my point was that the brexit vote alligned with what the uk propaganda urged people to do .
