  and this while other countries have long since recovered . 
  even spain is doing better . 
  ** so , your logic , when seeing 1 temporary failure in a group of 28 , is that the whole group is a failure ? 
   i did not say that about duty free , only a retard thinks duty free means cheap . 
  you said that  the duty free stuff at airport is around 50 % more expensive for eu members than otherwise . 
  are you trying to imply that if an american were to buy from the same shop , he/she would get a better price ? 
  or that duty-free shops from non-eu countries have better prices ? 
  both of these are irrelevant . 
  shops can set whatever prices they want . 
  you can actually argue that if the prices are higher , that means that people are actually willing to pay more because , otherwise , those products would n't get sold . 
   the eu parliament is so badly designed - massively unfair to certain countries , some small countries have an exorbitant amount of meps compared to larger nations which is unfair . 
  each country gets seats according to how big its population is . 
  geographic size has nothing to do with it . 
   plus the parliament can not initiate legislation , it comes top down from the unelected commission , which is full of incompetent buffoons due to the one-seat-per-nation rule this is a subjective opinion . 
  if they propose a `` bad '' idea , the parliament can reject it . 
  also , this is not the purpose of the eu commission . 
  they are not supposed to represent their countries but propose ideas that will benefit everyone . 
  that 's why each country gets only 1 seat , so that all ideas can be heard and debated by the parliament . 
   again , i think overall it will harm the uk to leave . 
  but pretending that the eu is anything but a big fat mess is a joke . 
  it is a corpse kept standing by rigor mortis . 
  how is it `` a big fat mess '' if you think the uk leaving is a bad idea ? 
  these are two conflicting ideas . 
   unfortunately , more people thought ` hold my beer ' . 
  [ the same thing happened in the us . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tehekdqsixg ) fool me once , shame on you . 
  fool me twice ... well , that copy-pasta is getting cold . 
  and the french , at least , do n't like cold pasta . 
   so someone says `` it 's a bit silly to assume we feel that way did n't the brexit vote already prove that the majority feels that way ? 
   `` yeah but your tabloid papers have bias haha '' that 's putting it lightly , honestly . 
   )  cool more and more people agree to the reddit `` bias '' , meaning that brexit was a bad idea . 
  reddit is , essentially , only reflecting what people say . 
  and if the polls from many countries say so , then there must be some hint of truth to it . 
  is it really so crazy of an idea that people actually admit to making mistakes ? 
  it 's either that or the polls are `` fake '' . 
  brexit is probably going to be a net loss but there is no way you can call the eu an economic success in recent years . 
  nope . 
  i did n't . 
  i said it 's thriving . 
  that means it 's making profit instead of losing money as everyone else implied before the brexit vote via tabloid propaganda . 
  the eu has had a very slow recovery from the 2008 crisis . 
  it 's slow , but steady . 
  this is exactly how an economy should work . 
  it should be predictable and stable . 
   the duty free stuff at airport is around 50 % more expensive for eu members than otherwise . 
  duty-free does n't mean stuff is cheaper . 
  that 's a common misconception . 
  this is also a very narrow point of view . 
   the eu just came close to passing a law that charged websites for linking to other websites . 
  stupidest idea possible , but the decision would override national parliaments . 
  yep . 
  but it did n't . 
  people are free to propose whatever crazy ideas they may have . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  also , the uk is trying to ban encryption . 
  so if germany , but on a local level . 
  these will also not pass because it would mean stopping all digital transactions because they will no longer be secure . 
  it 's all just a big political speech aimed at the non tech-savvy conservatives . 
  theresa may did it to get more votes , but it did n't really work . 
  german conservatives are doing the same thing . 
  it 'll probably not work for them either . 
   i guess the eu is like a parasite , in the truest symbiotic sense . 
  it is a malignant body attached to all member states . 
  the symbiotic part is true . 
  there is always strength in numbers . 
  the malignant part is not true because all the loses a country gets by leaving are relative to the gains after joining . 
  so , overall , there is no net loss because you were doing worse before joining . 
  ** the loses are relative to the state of actually being in the union . 
  ** if you 're ok to lose all the benefits of the union and to return to the initial state of no benefits , then , by all means , leave . 
   that 's not what i asked though do i believe that a majority of brits fell for the anti eu tabloid propaganda ? 
  yes , i do . 
  the official brexit vote proved it . 
  but , it 's ok . people usually learn from their mistakes . 
   the article we 're commenting on proves this . 
   my favourite thing about / r/europe is being told what my country thinks https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fzcqj/british_newspapers_telling_people_who_to_vote_for/ a nice change , do n't you think ? 
  sometimes it takes a big fuck-up for people to finally get the right idea . 
  do n't worry , it 'll work out in the end . 
   do you actually believe this ? 
  do i believe that the eu would crash and burn ? 
  of course not . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the brits believed it . 
  [ 3 reasons brits voted for brexit ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/07/05/3-reasons-brits-voted-for-brexit/2/#7e43ad07672e )  the first was simple . 
   opponents of the eu argued that it is a dysfunctional economic entity . 
  the eu failed to address the economic problems that had been developing since 2008 ... for example , 20 % unemployment in southern europe . 
  guess what ? 
  the eu is thriving .

   was it really a sacrifice if he knew we would be resurrected after just one weekend ? 
  the tories could really use a miracle right now . 
  were they hoping for one ? 
  probably . 
  would have been easier to vote . 
   so the uk is like jesus , sacrificing itself for the eu . 
  nope . 
  jesus sacrificed himself willingly . 
  the uk left thinking the eu would be the one to crash and burn . 
  trial and error , baby !, 
  clearly spain is heating portugal . 
  that 's what you get for being too clingy .
