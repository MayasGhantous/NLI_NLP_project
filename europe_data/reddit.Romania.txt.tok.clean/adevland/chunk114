  go north !, 
  watch out , france !, 
  hot & sweaty singles in your area . 
   i do n't recall saying , nor implying that i have such a fear . 
  it 's a common sentiment now-a-days . 
  it was , essentially , the main reasoning behind brexit . 
   ministers from central government and federal states said encrypted messaging services , such as whatsapp and signal , allow militants and criminals to evade traditional surveillance . 
   `` we ca n't allow there to be areas that are practically outside the law , '' interior minister thomas de maiziere told reporters in the eastern town of dresden . 
  wikipedia says he 's a close confidant of merkel . 
  sad . 
  merkel can do better . 
  :(  `` children are victims of extremism , '' said social democrat family affairs minister katharina barley , who said authorities should be protecting children not spying on their friends . 
  at least this is being opposed . 
  voters need to remember the names of these people when choosing their next representatives . 
   ministers also agreed to improve communication between the many different regional and national police and investigation agencies in the highly decentralised country . 
  this is the big problem and they mention it as a side note . 
   citizens of bulgaria bulgaria and romania romania require a visa unless they hold a valid non-immigrant u.s. visa or if they have held a canadian visa in the past 10 years and travel by air . 
  they may not enter canada by land or sea unless holding a valid visa . 
  this will change starting with december 1st 2017 because of ceta . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  he says that what romanians have to do to travel to canada is to fill in a form on the embassy 's site , respectively the electronic travel authority . 
   `` it takes two minutes and costs usd 7 . 
  it is supplied to all the citizens from the countries exempted from visas who want to visit canada , whether for tourism or for business . 
  if in 2017 you intend to visit canada , this is what you have to do , '' said hamilton . 
   regarding ceta , the free trade agreement between eu and canada , he says that romania is positioned to benefit directly of all the ceta fields , whether it 's about goods trade , customs tariffs reduction , the intellectual property rights and the work force mobility . 
  i honestly do n't know what you 're trying to prove here . 
  you 've literally proved that freedom of movement goes hand in hand with free trade . 
   they are fightning symptoms instead of fightning the cause . 
  i agree . 
  but if you steal a loaf of bread because you do n't have a job and you 're starving , it 's still theft . 
  the pirate bay founders always preach about free speech while profiting from porn ads along-side the latest hollywood blockbuster movie torrent download page . 
  the pirate bay html title tag reads as  download music , movies , games , software !, 
  there are plenty of other torrent sites that do not paint big red targets on their backs and still exist today under the pretense that they are not responsible for what their users share between themselves . 
  the difference between them and pirate bay is that they do n't publicly promote themselves as a pirating site while also claiming that what users share is not their responsibility . 
  the two ideas conflict with each other . 
  which is it ? 
   download music , movies , games , software !, 
  or `` the content shared between users is the responsibility of those users . '', 
   a border agent can deny you entry without stating a reason . 
  these treaties do not supersede local immigration policies . 
  a country can always deny entry if too many people immigrate or if someone does n't pass all the required checks . 
  as far as i know , the race and religion issues are only a problem for the us customs since trump took office . 
  i do not support xenophobia , racism or trump , but i support local immigration policies and security checks as long as they abide basic human rights . 
   no it 's not . 
  you literally said that . 
  said what ? 
  please be specific . 
   i see you 're backtracking now . 
  here 's the comment i made yesterday that says the same thing . 
   https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6h6far/eu_japan_launch_big_push_to_seal_free_trade_deal/divx5wg/  because that is what you implied . 
  you said free movement like the eu 's common market . 
  i never said that . 
  please do n't assume things on my behalf . 
   also , arguing that ceta does n't allow for the same freedom of movement as in the eu is irrelevant because canada is not in the eu and they do not have the same free trade as in the eu . 
  some tariffs still apply . 
   free trade and freedom of movement are always directly proportionate because you need people from the other country/region to make free trade possible . 
  that 's what i said . 
   yep you are definitely trying to backtrack now . 
  lol . 
  backtrack on what ? 
  look at my post history . 
  i 've always said that the are not black or white issues and that free trade is directly proportionate with freedom of movement . 
  also , this particular discussion has , up to this point , been limited to one guying saying i 'm wrong and me making fun of him because he 's provided no arguments to support his idea of why i 'm wrong . 
  you 've been proven wrong with facts and you 're now retreating to the same `` you 're wrong because i say so '' safe place as the other guy . 
   there is n't 100 % free trade in the single market either . 
  services essentially run outside of the single market , which is by no means completed . 
  this was my point all along . 
  this is not a black or white issue . 
  free trade is directly proportionate with freedom of movement . 
   that is not freedom of movement . 
  it is the exact opposite no , it 's freedom of movement , but it 's limited . 
  you already admitted that even `` free trade '' is n't 100 % free . 
   contrast that with the freedom of movement between the nations of the eu china is not part of the eu . 
  the eu did n't invent freedom of movement and it does n't hold a patent on it . 
   i 'm all for freedom of movement between the uk and poland if it means only 1,800 skilled polish workers can come here and only for 3 years . 
  this is exactly my point when i say that it 's not a black or white issue . 
  you seem to believe it 's an `` all or nothing '' issue . 
  it is n't . 
  there are always limitations and regulations for the movement of people that are directly proportionate with how `` free '' trade is . 
   nationals of visa-exempt countries and u.s. permanent residents are eligible to transit ** through canada ** without a visa regardless of final destination and modes of transport , however all visa-exempt nationals except americans are required to have an eta for transit if arriving by air . 
  this only refers to transit through canada to another destination . 
  also , canada has bilateral trade agreements with all the countries that can do this . 
  canada has nafta with the us and ceta with the eu and both have provisions regarding the entry and stay of natural citizens . 
  below from your own article :  nationals of mexico and the united states whose professions are covered under the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) are able to apply for a work permit on arrival . 
   as we can see , the free trade area came into effect while containing nothing but `` declarations of intent to improve further cooperation '' . 
  this is a slow process . 
  the ukrainians can already travel to the eu for tourism and business whereas they could n't a few weeks ago . 
  there was the `` intent '' to give them free eu travel long before it actually happened . 
  this has been the case with all countries that joined the eu . 
  the whole process happens in stages . 
  they do n't just get everything over night . 
  look at the swiss . 
  they 're not in the eu , but they have bilateral agreements that make them a de facto member . 
  they have free trade and full fledged freedom of movement . 
  this took decades of negotiations . 
  haters like you said the same thing about ukraine before they got free eu travel . 
  that it would n't happen , but it did . 
  these are win - win agreements that will only get better in time just because everyone stand to gain from them . 
   well that 's easy , the first mercosur treaty had no mention of labour whatsoever . 
  [ mercosur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercosur )  its purpose is to promote free trade and the fluid movement of goods , ** people ** , and currency . 
  seriously , do you even fact check the things you say before you say them ?
