   or the swiss-eec fta of 1972 contains nothing on labour mobility or migration the [ 1972 free trade agreement ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/world/agreements/preparecreatetreatiesworkspace/treatiesgeneraldata.do?step=0&amp;redirect=true&amp;treatyid=73 ) was in place only for certain products .

   until de conclusion of the set of seven bilateral agreements negotiated between 1994 and 1998 , concluded in 1999 and entered into force in 2002 , this 1972 agreement was the principal bilateral agreement between the european community and switzerland . 
  it provides for ** free trade in industrial products ** . 
  the 1972 agreement has been amended several times , in certain cases through the adoption of additional protocols . 
  ** some of these agreements were superseded by the further bilateral agreements entered into force in 2002 ( 7 agreements ) and in 2006 ( 9 agreements ) .

  free movement of people ... ...  you seem to be completely confused between what we call labour mobility , which can be any measure that facilitates migration of workers between two parties ( and which can be as minimal as shortening bureaucratic visa procedures ) ; and the freedom of movement for workers , which is very precisely defined by the eu . 
  freedom of movement was n't invented by the eu . 
  the eu does n't have the authority to define it 's meaning . 
  nobody has this authority because it 's not a black or white issue . 
  the same goes for free trade . 
  each trade agreement has different provisions regarding trade and the movement of people . 
  ... ... . .  of course an agreement between the eu and the uk would almost certainly include some form of labour mobility , as do most modern ftas . 
  this was my point all along . 
   he is a fucboi . 
  thanks for the kind words . 
   he beleives that mexicans have freedom of movement with the u.s. lol and that nafta provides freedom of movement . 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' . 
  these numbers include both entrants under the nafta agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the canadian immigration law . 
  this is not my `` belief '' . 
  these are official statistics . 
   cause freedom of movement for me means exactly that , that no border agent can refuse you entry because he does n't like your face or religion . 
  there are no restrictions based on race or religion .

  ... ...  and just because mexicans and canadians can come to the u.s. doea n't mean there is free movement . 
  yeah . 
  they can come to the us under the nafta agreement , but that does n't mean they can come in the us under the nafta agreement . 
  / s you 've been proven wrong and now you 've switched the goal post from denying it to debating semantics and the definition of freedom of movement .

   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
  i 'm sorry , but  pretty sure is not a fact . 
  no offence . 
   you are trying to compare the common market to a trade agreement . 
  a person who have taken a rudimentary economics class will be capable of seeing , that what you are saying is complete nonsense . 
  [ free trade areas in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_trade_areas_in_europe )  the eu shares its single market with three efta members via the european economic area agreement , and the remaining efta member -- switzerland -- via bilateral agreements . 
   the [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) ( eea ) is the area in which the agreement on the eea provides for the ** free movement of persons , goods , services and capital ** within the european single market , as well as the freedom to choose residence in any country within this area . 
  the eea was established on 1 january 1994 upon entry into force of ** the eea agreement ** . 
  there is a free trade agreement within the common market . 
  it 's called the eea agreement . 
   the other guy was implying that you had to have free movement as in the eu common market and even tried to claim that the common market was like any other trade agreement . 
  this is false . 
  i said that you ca n't have free trade without freedom of movement while also stating that these are not black or white issues . 
  i said they are directly proportionate to each other , meaning that there are always restrictions because trade is never 100 % free . 
  people take the terms `` free '' literally and expect things to be unrestricted and unregulated . 
  this is not true . 
   i 'm prone to agree with the latter as unrestricted immigration tend to lead to more negatives than positives . 
  freedom of movement is n't a black or white issue . 
  there are always restrictions on the conditions and duration of the stay that are directly proportionate to the freedom of the trade . 
  the eu allows people to move and even relocate to other eu member countries with very few restrictions . 
  local immigration policies still apply . 
  you still have to go through screening and the whole thing can be limited if too many people from one country start immigrating . 
  the idea that a `` wave of immigrants '' will engulf your country at any moment is just tabloid fear mongering propaganda . 
   i thought isis were in favour of terrorism as well ? 
  it 's about dup . 
  they support religious extremism , but not terror attacks . 
  at least as far as i know . 
   and all of them will include provisions on labor movement , but with so many restrictions calling that `` freedom of movement is a joke you 're debating semantics . 
  you ca n't call it `` 75 % freedom of movement '' . 
  it 's called freedom of movement because it allows people to move freely under certain conditions whereas this was n't possible before the deal was signed . 
  it does give people more freedom to move . 
  it 's not a joke . 
  the more free the trade , the more free the movement of people . 
  i 'm glad we agree on this because it 's been like this for ages . 
   new zealand has a free trade deal with china . 
  [ new zealand -- china free trade agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand%e2%80%93china_free_trade_agreement )  under the agreement , 37 per cent of chinese exports to new zealand and 35 per cent of new zealand exports to china will be tariff free by october 2008 . 
  it 's not 100 % free trade . 
  because of that , freedom of movement is limited , but it does happen . 
   the deal also allows 1,800 specialised workers to go from china to new zealand for a period of up to three years . 
  you ca n't have trade without people from the other side . 
   there are no provisions for free movement of labour in there to the best of my knowledge . 
  [ visa-free travel to the eu launches in ukraine ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/06/11/visa-free-travel-to-the-eu-launches-in-ukraine )  while there is visa-free business travel as of a couple of days ago , those are entirely separate agreements . 
  it 's not just for business . 
  it 's for tourism as well . 
  both the recent visa-free travel and the dcfta are part of eu - ukraine negotiations . 
   the deep and comprehensive free trade areas ( [ dcfta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_and_comprehensive_free_trade_area ) ) are three free trade areas established between the european union , and georgia , moldova and ukraine respectively . 
  ** the dcftas are part of each country 's eu association agreement . 
   none of the trade deals the eu has with other countries contains anything about freedom of movement for workers . 
  this is false . 
  ceta allows all eu citizens to travel to canada without a visa and stay for up to 30 days . 
  those that work there can stay for up to 1 year for each contract . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  he says that what romanians have to do to travel to canada is to fill in a form on the embassy 's site , respectively the electronic travel authority . 
   `` it takes two minutes and costs usd 7 . 
  it is supplied to all the citizens from the countries exempted from visas who want to visit canada , whether ** for tourism or for business ** . 
  if in 2017 you intend to visit canada , this is what you have to do , '' said hamilton . 
  please stop misleading people . 
   since things like that are pretty complicated people tend to mix up the specific terms . 
  in this case travelling without visa , respectively working with visa , and freedom of movement .
