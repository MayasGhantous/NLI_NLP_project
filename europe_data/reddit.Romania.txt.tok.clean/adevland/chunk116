  you 're debating semantics . 
  there are various degrees of [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement ) . 
   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
  ** by your logic , we should n't be calling it `` free trade '' because each trade deal has different terms and conditions . 
   there are no trade agreements that contain freedom of movement for workers . 
  and i doubt that we 'll see such agreements in the near future . 
  oh , really ? 
  how about the eu ? 
  how about ceta ? 
  here 's a challenge . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   provisions about movement of people are not the same as free movement of people . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  free movement involves provisions about movement of people . 
  it 's not a black or white issue . 
   provisions about movement of people are not the same as free movement of people . 
  for the hundredth time : it 's not a black and white issue . 
  you do n't seem to argue that about free trade , although provisions differ from one deal to another . 
  you 're cherry picking your arguments and ignoring facts while failing to prove anything you say . 
  this discussion is over . 
   you say `` free trade can not happen without freedom of movement '' , then you say its not black and white . 
  dude , you are lost cause . 
  you 're taking things out of context . 
  i 've said that  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  free trade and freedom of movement are always directly proportionate because you need people from the other country/region to make free trade possible . 
  i 've asked you for one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
  so far you 've failed to provide one . 
  i 've said that  it 's not a black or white issue .

  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   im sure there are plenty of such agreements . 
  that 's not proof . 
  you might as well say `` im sure that santa claus is real '' . 
   you only back your claim with one argument : the whole process would be much more cumbersome . 
  did you even read my post ? 
  i 've brought plenty of examples , facts and arguments . 
  you failed to provide a single example that proves your theory . 
   that defeats the whole point you are trying to make by the post . 
  i 've explicitly mentioned this in the post . 
  did you even read it ? 
   obviously there may be free trade without free people movement and vice versa there may be , theoretically , but , in practice , there is n't , for the reasons i mentioned above . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   otherwise it addresses visa free travel and making it easier to obtain work visa , and not freedom of movement .

  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
   i 'm not saying that at all . 
  all i am saying is that free trade can and does exist without freedom of movement . 
  still no proof that what you say is true . 
  at this point you 're just spamming this discussion . 
   when you do n't get a visa for the us , even if you formally fulfil the requirements , you ca n't sue the us government for violating your rights . 
  because you do n't have a right to enter the country . 
  what does this have to do with anything ? 
  your country either has a free trade agreement with the us or it does n't . 
  you also do n't have to sue them personally . 
  others can do it for you . 
  [ president trump loses another travel-ban legal battle ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/trump-travel-ban-ninth-circuit/530055/ )  trade deals give you zero travel rights in regard to the other country . 
  if the country does n't allow you to move there you ca n't do anything against it . 
  this is about free trade deals . 
  not all trade deals are about free trade . 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' . 
  these numbers include both entrants under the nafta agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the canadian immigration law . 
  ... ... . .  that 's why it 's stupid to water down the definition of freedom of movement to visa-free travel and temporary work visa . 
  both of them require goodwill of the host country . 
  freedom of movement on the other hand is actually a right that you can enforce against the will of the host country . 
  this is false . 
  these things are negotiated each time and they differ for each country . 
  by your logic nafta is not a free trade deal because it has different trade provisions with each country that signed it . 
  ** free trade is always directly proportionate to freedom of movement . 
  these are not black and white issues . 
   they can use trains and mostly use shipping containers so they can mbeadh moved freely without the people being moved freely along with the goods . 
  if you 're saying that there are no other people involved in trade other than moving the goods , then you 're being naive . 
  trade is not just about moving goods from point a to point b. 
  and you do n't have to take my word for it . 
  this is a historical fact . 
  all great trade routes of old concentrated in cities where freedom of movement was not only possible , but embraced along with cultural diversity . 
   free trade can and does occur without freedom of movement . 
  prove it . 
  give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   nafta does not have freedom of movement in the eu sense . 
  because none of the nafta countries are part of the eu .

   no because it 's complete gibberish . 
  so , we just have to take your word for it . 
  no arguments . 
  no facts . 
  nothing . 
  good to know . 
   visa liberalisation or similar measures are not , unlike what you stubbornly and wrongly proclaim , freedom of movement .
