   i 've just pointed out the technical holes in the argument . 
  what technical holes ? 
  you 've arbitrarily given a definition to freedom of movement based on what you think it is and made statements with no facts or arguments to uphold them . 
   it depends on what you call `` free trade . '', 
  my point exactly . 
  movement of people provisions are directly proportionate with trade provisions whenever a free trade deal is involved . 
  this is not a black or white issue . 
  these things are always negotiated . 
   what problems ? 
  the early vote to get a bigger majority that ended with a hung parliament . 
  the dup deal to form a majority . 
  the dup have a similar agenda to isis , except for terrorist acts . 
  yep . 
  nothing to see here . 
   freedom of movement is when people can move around without a need for visas and can work freely in these places . 
  there are various rules and regulations that may or may not restrict this in regards to the duration or conditions of each stay . 
  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  by your logic , there is no such thing as `` free trade '' because each country has a different free trade agreement . 
   that point does n't become true just because you watered down the definition of freedom of movement to the point where it covers temporary work visa and visa-free travel for 30 days . 
  it 's not `` watered down '' because it 's not a black or white issue . 
  by your logic there is no such thing as `` free trade '' because it 's different for each country that has a free trade agreement . 
   that is simply not true . 
  why ? 
  because you say so ? 
   free trade can happen without freedom of movement . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  ** prove it . 
  ** give me one example of a free trade agreement between countries that does n't involve provisions about movement of people . 
   that 's why freight companies exist . 
  do n't people work for those freight companies ? 
  do the trucks/boats/planes drive themselves ? 
  are n't services involved ? 
  do n't you need people handling orders and legal matters ? 
  do n't these people need to move and stay in the other country if they want to move goods from one point to another ? 
  people are always involved . 
  and it 's not a black or white matter , meaning that there are various degrees of freedom of movement which is directly proportionate with the free trade deal provisions . 
   and if nafta would contain freedom of movement the numbers would be very different . 
  you just moved the goal post . 
   with mexico being a much less wealthy country than canada , more mexicans would move to the us if they could . 
  there are always limitations . 
  this is exactly my point . 
  it 's not a black or white issue . 
  trade and movement of people go hand in hand and are always directly proportionate . 
   ca n't find the term `` freedom of movement '' in these statements . 
  first of all , you just moved the goal post . 
  secondly , you 're debating semantics which is the bottom of the barrel for any argument . 
   do n't get ridiculous . 
  visa free travel is not freedom of movement . 
  there are various degrees of [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement ) . 
   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
   i do n't even have to look at nafta 's specifics ignorance is bliss . 
    because it is as simple as the fact there are different types of free trade agreements this only proves that the whole thing is n't a black or white issue . 
   i gave an example of one in my original comment you mentioned tpp which is n't a free trade agreement . 
  secondly , trump moved the us out of tpp in january 2017 . 
  as i said earlier , ignorance is bliss . 
   and as you 've said it 's a common market and not an area that has a free trade agreement . 
  dude , read the site . 
  it specifically mentions the [ four freedoms ] ( http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features ) . 
   it covers the four freedoms , i.e. 
  the free movement of goods , capital , services and persons do you have a reading or comprehension disorder ? 
   for tourists and business trips . 
  as a german i have had this with canada for a very long time . 
  you 're shifting your goals posts , buddy . 
  these provisions take effect in stages . 
  not all countries get them at once . 
  read the article . 
   so can most other temporary work visa in basically all countries . 
   a visa is a visa is a visa . 
  this is visa free travel . 
  no visa is required . 
  again , do you have a reading or comprehension disorder ? 
   freedom of movement is a right that allows you to live , work and travel wherever you want . 
  you 've shifted the goal post again . 
   you are now debating semantics . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for every argument . 
  there are various degrees of [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement ) . 
   the visa restrictions index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa . 
  [ visa restrictions index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henley_%26_partners_visa_restrictions_index ) ** this is not a black or white issue . 
   they obviously do n't have free movement and nothing in your comment suggests they do . 
  it 's not 100 % free . 
  nafta also does n't remove all tariffs from trade . 
   the implementation of nafta on january 1 , 1994 brought the immediate elimination of tariffs on more than one-half of mexico 's exports to the u.s. and more than one-third of u.s. exports to mexico . 
  within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement , all u.s.-mexico tariffs would be eliminated except for some u.s. agricultural exports to mexico that were to be phased out within 15 years . 
  most u.s.-canada trade was already duty-free . 
  nafta also sought to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property rights on traded products . 
  it 's easier for canadians to enter the us and it 's harder for mexicans to do so , as are their respective trade provisions . 
  ** this is the point . 
  trade and mobility of persons are always directly proportionate . 
   you are absolutely right here . 
  please have a look at [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons ) . 
  all trade agreements have directly proportionate mobility of persons agreements . 
   the united states has free trade agreements in force with 20 countries . 
  am i supposed to take your word for it that there is no freedom of movement ? 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' . 
  these numbers include both entrants under the nafta agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the canadian immigration law . 
  ...  the united states has completed negotiations of a regional , asia-pacific trade agreement , known as the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement and is in negotiations of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t-tip ) with the european union , with the objective of shaping a high-standard , broad-based regional pact . 
  tpp is not a free trade agreement and trump withdrew the us from tpp back in january .
