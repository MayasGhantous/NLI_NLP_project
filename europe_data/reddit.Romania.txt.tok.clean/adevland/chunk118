   so you are calling temporary work visa freedom of movement ? 
  i am . 
  and so does the canadian ambassador . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  he says that what romanians have to do to travel to canada is to fill in a form on the embassy 's site , respectively the electronic travel authority . 
   `` it takes two minutes and costs usd 7 . 
  it is supplied to all the citizens from the countries exempted from visas who want to visit canada , whether ** for tourism or for business ** . 
  if in 2017 you intend to visit canada , this is what you have to do , '' said hamilton . 
   by telephone . 
  you tell that to your next employer and see how comfortable he is about you working `` by telephone '' . 
   see , for example , nafta - a free trade area with no free movement at all . 
  nafta also has a form of freedom of movement . 
  [ nafta - mobility of persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement#mobility_of_persons )  according to the department of homeland security yearbook of immigration statistics , during fiscal year 2006 ( i.e. , october 2005 through september 2006 ) , 73,880 foreign professionals ( 64,633 canadians and 9,247 mexicans ) were admitted into the united states for temporary employment under nafta ( i.e. , in the tn status ) . 
  additionally , 17,321 of their family members ( 13,136 canadians , 2,904 mexicans , as well as a number of third-country nationals married to canadians and mexicans ) entered the u.s. in the treaty national 's dependent ( td ) status . 
   canadian authorities estimated that , as of december 1 , 2006 , a total of 24,830 u.s. citizens and 15,219 mexican citizens were present in canada as `` foreign workers '' . 
  these numbers include both entrants under the nafta agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the canadian immigration law . 
   not a trade agreement . 
  all eu countries are members of the common market where free trade happens . 
  it 's called the [ european economic area ] ( http://www.efta.int/eea ) . 
   the european economic area ( eea ) unites the eu member states and the three eea efta states ( iceland , liechtenstein , and norway ) into an internal market governed by the same basic rules . 
  these rules aim to ** enable goods , services , capital , and persons to move freely about the eea in an open and competitive environment ** , a concept referred to as the four freedoms . 
  ...  do you actually believe that you 'll get the right to move ( not to be confused with your right to travel there for 90 days without a visa ) to canada once ceta comes into effect ? 
  yes . 
  [ ceta signed | romania 's government confirms the elimination of visas for canada in two stages ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/ceta-signed-romanias-government-confirms-the-elimination-of-visas-for-canada-in-two-stages-122870 ) with ceta you are limited to 1 year stays per contract if you work there . 
  this can easily become unlimited if your contractor is willing to renew your contract each year . 
  you can also enter and stay without a visa for business trips of up to 30 days . 
  here 's the official [ ceta document ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) . 
  read chapter ten : temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes, 
   what exactly does that mean ? 
  does it make getting a job easier , or does it just mean that once a person from one region has a job in the other , they are guaranteed the right to live there ? 
  it depends on each trade agreement . 
  in the eu you can work and stay in any eu country for as long as you want . 
  you can also visit for long periods of time as a tourist . 
  terms and conditions differ from country to country , but this is your right as an eu citizen . 
  here 's an [ official eu video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qz4yqm6nxm ) explaining this . 
  with ceta , things are slightly different . 
  the free trade is n't 100 % free . 
  some tariffs still apply . 
  freedom of movement is also not permanent . 
  you are limited to 1 year stays per contract if you work there . 
  this can easily become unlimited if your contractor is willing to renew your contract each year . 
  you can also enter and stay without a visa for business or tourism trips of up to 30 days . 
  here 's the official [ ceta document ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) . 
  read chapter ten : temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes, 
   so how come that i do n't know of any free trade agreement that includes freedom of movement ? 
  ignorance is never a valid argument . 
  have n't you heard of the eu ? 
  how about ceta ? 
  both include forms of free trade and freedom of movement . 
   why ca n't you have free trade but no freedom of movement ? 
  because you need people from the other side to handle the selling/buying . 
  without them , the whole process would be much more cumbersome and not even close to what free trade is supposed to be . 
  that 's why free trade and freedom of movement are always directly proportionate . 
  because ** you need people for trade to happen ** . 
  this is a historical fact . 
  all great trade routes of old concentrated in cities where freedom of movement was not only possible , but embraced along with cultural diversity . 
  the last [ official report ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/april/tradoc_155506.pdf ) from the talks also addresses freedom of movement . 
   the last outstanding issues of the text on ** entry and temporary stay of natural persons ** were also discussed . 
  although there are still no details , this is looking more and more like ceta . 
  people from canada and the eu can enter and temporary stay in the other country/region as long as they have a job there . 
  lots of people wrongfully use ceta and the new eu - japan trade deal negotiations as examples for the idea that free trade can happen without freedom of movement . 
  it ca n't . 
  also , arguing that ceta does n't allow for the same freedom of movement as in the eu is irrelevant because canada is not in the eu and they do not have the same free trade as in the eu . 
  some tariffs still apply . 
  free trade and freedom of movement are always directly proportionate because you need people from the other country/region to make free trade possible . 
   if may does n't go through with brexit the 51 % of people for brexit are forced to vote an actual radical far right party . 
  she fucked up hoping people will give her god like authority while actually losing the majority . 
  people did n't vote for dup to lead brexit . 
   you ca n't just ignore the problem and hope people have forgotten by the next election . 
  what problem ? 
  all the big problems popped up after the brexit vote . 
  the brexit negotiation is only getting worse for the uk and it did n't even start . 
  not gon na happen . 
  theresa may would rather make an alliance with a radical right wing party as the dup than `` admit defeat '' and make a compromise for the good of the people . 
  she 'll rather fuck up human rights in the name of `` fighting terrorism '' than admit under-funding the police who knew about those terrorists . 
  you wo n't read these things in the local uk tabloids . 
  he was `` on vacation '' . 
   it 's become abundantly clear recently that most people on the internet are n't the average voter . 
  conservatives are usually old people . 
  and old people do n't spend much time on the internet while usually considering human rights as being nonproductive and a waste of time . 
  sure , that 's what they think , but that 's not the goal because , like all religious zealots , they 're just puppets to state leaders . 
  extremist muslims are used as cannon fodder and manipulation vessels by middle eastern leaders in order to seize and maintain power . 
  what 's happening right now in the middle east is exactly what happened in europe in the middle ages . 
  ** it 's all just despotic politics under religious pretense . 
  when you start to lose your rights , that 's when terrorists have won . 
  they have the same ideas  but it 's not like he said he welcomes them or anything . 
  yep . 
   its founder , allan carlson , who also spoke on the summit 's opening day , has previously called heterosexual , procreative marriage `` the bulwark of ordered liberty '' . 
  so the government sponsored this event and held it at official government buildings ,  but it 's not like he said he welcomes them or anything . 
   the hungarian government 's role has been managed by katalin novak , the minister for family affairs and a rising star in orban 's government . 
  zoltan kovacs , the prime minister 's international spokesman , confirmed that the government had provided funding . 
   the wcf described hungary on its website as showing strategic leadership in becoming `` an advocate for the natural family in europe '' . 
  so the hungarian government gave them money and got high praise in return ,  but it 's not like he said he welcomes them or anything . 
  yeah . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  nothing to see here . 
   my issue is that past actions is not proof of this death being linked . 
  these are not `` past '' actions . 
  these are recent cases .

  putin is the russian head of state .
