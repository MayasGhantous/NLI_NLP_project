  not just her . 
  the whole uk because of theresa may . 
  strong and stable . 
  the idea that there was a coup is the coup . 
  russia is withholding wreckage critical to the plane crash investigation but the west is the one trying to interfere in russian affairs . 
  hmm ... 
   by that logic , virtually everyone over 50 is a former communist politician . 
  not everyone was a member of the communist party . 
  especially not the millions of people that were sent to forced labor camps and those that were tortured to death . 
  remember crimea ? 
  he 's a man and he made a joke about not being a woman . 
   turkey alters their tourism arrivals through the inclusion of migrants that use turkey as a transit route . 
  is this really happening ? 
  do you have any source for this ? 
   macron wants a more united eu , which means more power to germany this is cheap and simplistic propaganda . 
  macron actually proposed changes to the eu and merkel agrees . 
   macron will also push for open borders . 
  [ there already are open borders in the eu . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qz4yqm6nxm ), 
   i would love a ** competent ** russian woman president . 
  the gender really does n't matter . 
  yep . 
  but , remember , you got ta `` grab 'em by the pussy '' . 
  the tourism statistics for the 2017 summer season should be really interesting for turkey . 
  they 'll probably break the record for the longest stay of a foreign tourist . 
   are you just gon na ignore the fact that women are more emotional by nature ? 
  ** it 's not a bad thing ** putin disagrees . 
   i do n't like le pen either because her economic policies are rubbish guess what ? 
  macron has lots of experience in that field . 
    and some of her buddies are vichy apologists yep . 
  not to mention her father . 
  macron has no such problems . 
  he may not be perfect , but he 's the best you got right now . 
  you need to have big dreams to leave room for compromises . 
   since 2012 , she has been the center of attention in regard to a set of controversial laws concerning the rights of the lgbt community in russia and the adoption of russian orphan children by foreigners . 
  she is currently chairman of the duma committee on family , women and children affairs . 
  she has changed her political affiliation several times , ** having served public office on behalf of the communist party of the soviet union **  yelena mizulina is the author of several legislative projects directed against `` propaganda of homosexuality '' including the infamous russian lgbt propaganda law . 
  an anti lgbt and former communist politician for president ? 
  that would be terrible . 
  given the current state of things in russia , this might just happen . 
   ** born in ukraine ** , matviyenko started her political career in the 1980s in leningrad it probably wo n't happen ... 
   macron a former rothschild investment banker says it all really . 
  let me guess ... you like marine lepen , right ? 
   remember how she got all that money from russian banks ? 
  and how she has a eu salary while constantly bashing the eu ? 
  i 'm not saying macron is perfect . 
  i 'm saying he 's the best available choice . 
   also , most of his ideas and policies go against his `` rothschild investment banker '' past . 
  you 're literally judging the guy for being vaguely associated with some shady bankers in the past while completely ignoring the present . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
  it 's `` grab 'em by the pussy '' funny . 
  which makes it sad if you think it 's funny . 
  you know what would be funny ? 
  if a woman would become the next russian president . 
  now that would be hilarious . 
  most of the assets can be shared between nato and whatever eu defense force is conjured . 
  they do n't have to be separate . 
  you do n't need 2 tanks : 1 for nato and 1 for the eu . 
  you can have 1 tank that 's used both for nato and the eu . 
  this is possible because most of the time these assets just stand around doing nothing . 
  thanks , brexit . 
  got ta thank all those witless soldiers that post vain pictures of themselves and top secret military equipment on social media . 
  it 's sad because lots of russians actually find it funny . 
  it 's ironic , really . 
  the eu is the closest humanity has ever been to actually implementing a socialist utopia . 
  and that 's how terrorists won . 
  no re . 
   but behind the scenes everyone know that uk will be punished -- lets just say that only to discourage other countries from doing the same thing punished ? 
  not even close . 
  it 's all just business . 
  companies naturally go were trade is more profitable . 
  and with brexit , that means not in the uk . 
  brexit happened because of fear of immigrants . 
  plain and simple . 
  nobody considered that trade will go away . 
  the uk overestimated their financial market . 
  the market naturally moves to where it 's more profitable . 
  and that usually means an open market . 
  it 's not personal . 
  nobody is getting punished . 
  it 's just business . 
   turkey will get wiped really bad . 
  and erdogan know this very well !, 
  it 's not a game of personal grudges . 
  this is n't the 1800 's anymore . 
  a leader will fall if he does n't watch out for the well being of his people . 
  dictatorships never work on the long run . 
  the problem is people forget easily . 
  they forgot what it 's like to fight for freedom , so they easily allow politicians to take them away until they have none left . 
  then they fight for them . 
  it 's a vicious circle that will eventually get broken . 
  it 's all about education . 
  stupid people make stupid decisions . 
   i do n't know much about turkish economy , but do you think they will survive selling fruits , vegetables and tourism to russia and neighboring countries ? 
  they already essentially gave up on the eu . 
  and nato has nothing to do with trade . 
  the only way they 'll get sanctioned is if they pull some crimea annexing type of bull shit . 
   as a western supporting turk i despair at the glee of people here at ditching turkey . 
  me too . 
  ignoring a problem is n't going to fix it .
