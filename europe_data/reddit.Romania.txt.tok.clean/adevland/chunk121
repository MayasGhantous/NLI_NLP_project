  if anything , it only makes it worse . 
  good point . 
  it 'll be really interesting to see what happens in syria after isis is officially defeated . 
  i 'm pretty sure taking a military base hostage has never happened before and that erdogan does n't have the balls to do it . 
  that 's even more reason not to ignore them . 
   quite happy with the tories in power , at least they care more about the working people cool story , bro .

  how are brits reacting to this ? 
  is she gaining or losing popularity ? 
   there is absolutely nothing the eu can do to prevent erdogan from playing sultan . 
  true . 
  but this should n't be ignored . 
  it affects everyone , not just the turkish people . 
   a poor nation without nukes isnt a threat to anybody . 
  what if turkey leaves nato and allies itself with another soon to be poor nation that actually has nukes ? 
   honestly ; this is not our problem anymore . 
  until it is . 
  do you really expect turkey to quietly mind its own business ? 
  that 's what russia did , right ? 
  it 's time for the french to repay the favor and rescue the us and uk from themselves by setting a good example . 
   adevland : this is what russia wanted erdogan , putin and trump are all buddies . 
  this is a fact . 
  russia would benefit greatly if nato were to lose a big ally such as turkey . 
  and erdogan is a dictator wannabe so he really needs conflicts with the outside world or risk losing popular support . 
   turkey has been doing stupid shit all year this particular stupid shit has nothing to do with a long term strategy and is completely random . 
  yep . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's exactly what turkey and/or russia wanted in the first place . 
  inb4 : erdogan 's speech about how nato has forsaken turkey . 
  i 'm more curious about how he voted in regards to brexit .

  [ scientists loved and loathed by an agrochemical giant ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/business/scientists-loved-and-loathed-by-syngenta-an-agrochemical-giant.html )  dr. cresswell has also been skeptical of concerns raised about those pesticides , and even the extent of bee deaths . 
  but his initial research in 2012 undercut concerns about varroa mites as well . 
  so the company , based in switzerland , began pressing him to consider new data and a different approach . 
   looking back at his interactions with the company , dr. cresswell said in a recent interview that `` syngenta clearly has got an agenda . '' in an email , he summed up that agenda : `` it 's the varroa , stupid . ''  for dr. cresswell , 54 , the foray into corporate-backed research threw him into personal crisis . 
  some of his colleagues ostracized him . 
  he found his principles tested . 
  even his wife and children had their doubts . 
   `` they could n't believe i took the money , '' he said of his family . 
  `` they imagined there was going to be an awful lot of pressure and thought i sold out . ''  a review of syngenta 's strategy shows that ** dr. cresswell 's experience fits in with practices used by american competitors like monsanto and across the agrochemical industry ** . 
  scientists deliver outcomes favorable to companies , while university research departments court corporate support . 
  universities and regulators sacrifice full autonomy by signing confidentiality agreements . 
  and academics sometimes double as paid consultants . 
   that 's a completely different case !!!, 
  it 's all about glyphosate and whether or not it 's safe . 
  the eu based it 's decision on what the epa said . 
  the nyt article talks about unclassified documents that prove how the epa worked to benefit monsanto behind closed doors . 
   the court documents included monsanto 's internal emails and email traffic between the company and federal regulators . 
  the records suggested that monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that ** a senior official at the environmental protection agency had worked to quash a review of roundup 's main ingredient , glyphosate ** , that was to have been conducted by the united states department of health and human services . 
   after a quick investigation , officials at a medical school in new york state say they have found `` no evidence '' that a faculty member violated the school 's prohibition against authoring a paper ghostwritten by others . 
   an nymc spokesperson declined to provide details of how it conducted its investigation , saying in a statement that nymc `` does not disclose details of its internal investigations , but the college does consider the matter in question to be closed . '', 
  tl ; dr : the claim is false because we say it is . 
  our colleague would never do that . 
  sounds legit , right ? 
  case closed . 
  oh , and the monsanto blog saying that monsanto did n't do it is really cute . 
  :d  although 15 years later dr. heydens referred to such fully acknowledged contributions as ghostwriting , he described his actual role in the williams et al paper under oath as follows : `` i made some minor editorial contributions to that 2000 paper that do not mount to the level of a substantial contribution or an intellectual contribution and , thus , i was only recognized in the acknowledgements and not as an author , and that was appropriate for the situation . '' so he just edited the paper . 
  did not make any contributions other than that . 
   in one email unsealed tuesday , william f. heydens , a monsanto executive , told other company officials that they could ghostwrite research on glyphosate by hiring academics to put their names on papers that were actually written by monsanto . 
  ** `` we would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit & sign their names so to speak , '' ** mr. heydens wrote , citing a previous instance in which he said the company had done this . 
  the two stories match .

   i for one stopped caring 2 years ago , it set me free . 
  the `` i do n't give a fuck '' mentality in one of the biggest problems of mankind . 
  people only begin to care when it affects them personally and by then it 's usually either too late or way harder to do anything about it . 
   there 's just no will to it because it 'd be unpleasant and risky . 
  my point exactly . 
  that makes it not very easy . 
  you 'd get immigrants even if you close the borders . 
  they do n't just magically go away if you tell them they are not welcome . 
  we do n't live on the northern edge of the map were people can easily ignore you . 
  we were literally in the middle of it all . 
  we still are . 
   stop immigration , start repatriation . 
  you 're welcome .
