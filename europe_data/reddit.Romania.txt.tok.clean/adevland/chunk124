  just another perk of my ` freedom of movement ' . 
  exactly . 
  you ca n't permanently live there , but you can stay there for as long as you can find a job there . 
  `` free trade '' also is n't 100 % free . 
  why ? 
  because canada is not part of the eu . 
  you keep comparing ceta to what eu states get . 
  you should n't do that . 
  non eu countries will never get deals as good as eu countries get . 
  that includes free trade and freedom of movement . 
  ceta still has free trade , although it 's not 100 % free . 
  it also has freedom of movement although it 's not 100 % free . 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic while ignoring official statements on the matter . 
  believe it or not , your opinion is way less important that official documents and official statements . 
  so i should trust you and not the officials , right ? 
  31 jan 2018 `` is ceta in effect ? '', 
   i feel a little sorry for you because it 's something you clearly feel strongly about but i 'm hoping that your plans are n't relying on you being able to rock up to canada in december thinking they 'll let you stay . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  regarding ceta , the free trade agreement between eu and canada , he says that ** romania is positioned to benefit directly of all the ceta fields ** , whether it 's about goods trade , customs tariffs reduction , the intellectual property rights ** and the work force mobility ** . 
   several posters pointing out the fallacy of your argument but we 're all spreading fake news and you alone are the beacon of truth . 
  yeah . 
  and not just several users . 
  there 's a lot of fake news . 
  i pointed you to the official documents . 
  it 's not my opinion , it 's the official document . 
  you literally did nothing but debate semantics . 
  you 've brought no proof for what you 've said . 
  it 's literally your opinion versus official documents . 
  you 're clearly biased . 
  this discussion is over . 
   it 's not free then is it ? 
  you need a job and have to leave at the end of a time period . 
  you know what that sounds an awful lot like ... . . a visa . 
  you 're debating semantics right now , bro ? 
   you need a lot of paperwork for a visa . 
  that takes time and money . 
  with ceta you can just go there and work the moment you get a job to do so . 
  and the 12 month period can be extended or you can get another contract and stay another 12 months . 
  it 's essentially unlimited if you manage to get a steady job . 
   it 's also called `` freedom of movement '' in the ceta document itself as well as in all the other official eu documents that describe it . 
  but , hey , if you want to spread fake news about it , then go ahead . 
  you 're not the first . 
   what happened to europe 's migrant crisis ? 
  isis lost ? 
  nice try , russia . 
   did you read my post ? 
  go back and read it again . 
  i did . 
  you said [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bwoab/4000000_ukrainians_living_through_russias_war_in/dhrfixn/ )  no russia did n't profit from whole ukraine situation , far , very far from it those are your own words , bro . 
  you are contradicting yourself for the third time in a row . 
    similarly , russia is in worse condition than it was before whole ukrainian ordeal , but better condition than it would be if he allowed ukraine to just walk away . 
  walk away from what ? 
  what did ukraine do to russia ? 
  the whole russian `` sphere of influence '' argument only proves that russia is a war mongering state . 
  and the `` but better condition than it would be if he allowed ukraine to just walk away '' is also bs because russia is being heavily sanctioned for taking crimea . 
  russia would have lost nothing , except an already bruised pride , if ukraine joined nato and/or eu . 
  this is still going to happen . 
  it 's already happening . 
  [ ukrainians granted visa-free travel in the eu ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/04/06/ukrainians-granted-visa-free-travel-in-the-eu )  ukrainians have been granted visa-free travel in the eu , as the country moves towards greater integration with the west . 
  russia taking crimea only accelerated this process . 
   and regardless what people think about him , he is neither evil maniac who wants to personally kill every ukrainian nor saint who is out there to defend russian speaking population , he is a man who is responsible of making himself and his cronies ( and at smaller scale , rest of russia ) richer on this we can agree . 
  it 's glaringly obvious . 
   he does n't care about the average russian . 
  heck , he issued anti protest laws and is systemically blocking freedom of speech in russia . 
   he knows damn well , that if belarus , stans , armenia , syria and others see that it 's all right to join richer western club , he , his cronies and entire nation of russia will instantly turn into saudi arabia 2.0 with lesser oil , much bigger country to guard , much many mouths to feed , more hostile regions ruled by warlords and no islamist card to play . 
   and he is going to do everything , both right and wrong , just and unjust , popular and unpopular to avoid it . 
  so he 's basically afraid of the inevitable . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
    have a nice day . 
  you too . 
   yes , also because they needed it . 
  did n't you say that they did n't benefit from it ? 
   no russia did n't profit from whole ukraine situation , far , very far from it you 're contradicting yourself again . 
    ukraine did nothing ` wrong ' , they just went against russian interests and left russian sphere of influence . 
  ukraine is a sovereign country . 
  it has no obligation to be under the russian `` sphere of influence '' . 
  you 're admitting that russia is afraid of ukraine right now and that russia is a war mongering state . 
   if russia sent signal after maidan that `` guys , it 's okay to walk away from sphere of influence , i am not doing anything to stop you '' russia would fail sooner . 
  you said that russia gained nothing from crimea , and this is true . 
  the only thing russia got from crimea is a bunch of economical sanctions , internal protests , and a bunch of european countries that have already stopped buying russian gas or are planning to do so in the near future . 
  i think russia made it worse for themselves by annexing crimea . 
  they should have left ukraine alone . 
  their `` russia is stronk '' ego is crumbling russia from the inside . 
  and it 's sad . 
  because russia has a lot of potential to do good . 
   if only ukraine wanted it and everyone else was happy , there would have been no war . 
  who else threatened to annex crimea besides russia ? 
  :|  every country in russian sphere of influence wants to have richer ` partner ' / ` older brother ' ( call whatever you want ) , that is why russia has to tell every one of them , do n't even think about it , or else ... see what is going in ukraine ? 
  the communist block has fallen over 35 years ago . 
  the russian `` sphere of influence '' is a fairy tale . 
  there is no such thing . 
  all these countries want their independence because they earned it . 
  russia bullying them will only make them angrier and they will fight russia 's `` influence '' even harder . 
  and it 's making other countries help them . 
  ** russia has long lost it 's `` sphere of influence '' . 
  taking crimea was an act of desperation that has backfired . 
  ** russia is n't strong . 
  it 's afraid . 
   no russia did n't profit from whole ukraine situation , far , very far from it , but if russia allowed ukraine to walk away unpunished they would have lost even ( and imo much ) more . 
  wait ... unpunished for what ?
