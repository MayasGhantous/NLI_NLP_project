  what did ukraine do to russia ? 
   oh it absolutely did . 
  so russia lost , but they get to keep crimea ? 
  that 's some awesome losing right there . 
   entire ukraine was in their sphere of influence . 
  so russia took crimea because it could ? 
  that 's not a reason , bro . 
  that 's a war mongering state taking over territory from a sovereign country . 
   and letting ukraine go unpunished would surely speed up that process . 
  unpunished for what ? 
  did ukraine secretly invade russia and nobody found out ? 
   i am not claiming that it 's justified , or that russia is doing right thing , no , it 's fucked up thing , but for russian interests , it 's only way to go . 
  at least you admit it . 
  russia is a war mongering state . 
  they 're doomed to fail . 
  more and more countries are cutting them off from international trade . 
  russian gas is already being ditched . 
  and all of this because of some paranoid leader who ca n't handle one small country like ukraine wanting to leave their sphere of influence . 
  that 's pathetic . 
   no it did n't , but it 's way better than it would have been if russia turned into nuclear armed and ( much ) poorer version of saudi arabia . 
  so russia did n't profit from the annexation of crimea , but it did ? 
  you 're contradicting yourself . 
   russia lost fight in ukraine , of course life worsened after losing fight . 
  russia lost ? 
  really ? 
  then why did they get crimea ? 
  if russia lost , then why is the conflict still raging ? 
  why are people still dying ? 
   north korea is powerful enough to burn down anybody ? 
  wow must have missed that . 
  north korea burned all bridges with the outside world . 
  russia is doing the same because they 're afraid ukraine will join nato and the eu . 
  ** russia is so powerful , yet it 's afraid of ukraine even though they lost crimea . 
   the first thing the eu ( spearheaded by italy ) did was to threaten to kick us out of shengen if we did n't stop that as soon as possible that has nothing to do with sharing security intelligence . 
  imposing economical sanctions is the standard way of fighting foreign policies . 
  the uk skipped the `` i 'll take away your allowance '' method and went straight for the `` knife to the neck '' threat . 
   i do n't see why you think the eu would give a fuck about the situation of some people who do n't have the ambition to belong to the eu , they 're dead meat in brussels ' eyes . 
  you 're making it sound like the uk was kicked out of the eu . 
  it was n't . 
  it chose to leave . 
  and now it 's unhappy that `` leaving '' actually means leaving . 
  the eu made it clear that the uk can still change its mind . 
  uk 's response was a threat to cut security intel sharing . 
  who does n't give a shit about who ? 
   putin should about one and only one thing to make russia better place to live for average russian . 
  the lives of all average russians have tremendously improved since the annexation of crimea . 
  / s  and if the best way to do it is burning down entire universe outside of his country , he absolutely should do it . 
  it worked for north korea , right ? 
   are you implying that this is the same as freedom of movement as understood within the e.u. ? 
  because it clearly is not . 
  why ? 
  because ** canada is not in the eu ** . 
  there are different types of freedom of movement . 
  there are limitations even within the eu and they differ from country to country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement#common_limitations saying that freedom of movement , in regards to ceta , is not the same as in the eu does n't mean that it 's not freedom of movement . 
  it is . 
  it says so right in the ceta document and in all official eu statements about it . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** . 
  you 've changed your goal posts and you 're literally debating semantics right now . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for any discussion . 
   would anybody have expected a different behavior if it was the eu who had it 's hands on all the security stuff ? 
  of course not . 
  why ? 
  because the literally is n't any precedent of the eu ever doing this . 
  the uk , however , has always threatened to do this . 
  also , people keep ignoring the fact that security collaboration has nothing to do with trade or freedom of movement . 
  the uk is doing this because they 're a bunch of ass holes . 
  countries do this for mutual benefit even if there is no trade deal between them . 
   this is n't freedom of movement like the eu . 
  of course it 's not . 
  i never claimed it is . 
  why ? 
  because ** canada is not in the eu ** . 
  it 's still freedom of movement , though . 
  no visas are required and you can go there for work or vacation for up to 12 months . 
  it 's essentially unlimited because you can later return and stay for another 12 months . 
  it 's not the same as in the eu , obviously , because canada is not in the eu . 
  the trade deal is also not the same as in the eu for the exact same reason . 
  it does n't really matter it it actually has no effect , although it might . 
  at this point , after the failing brexit negotiations , this is all propaganda . 
  if may fails to get a good deal , at it kind of looks that way , her party is going to take all the blame . 
  they 're gearing up the damage control engines . 
   ceta contains an easing of visa requirements for business travel there are no visas , bro . 
   [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  regarding ceta , the free trade agreement between eu and canada , he says that ** romania is positioned to benefit directly of all the ceta fields ** , whether it 's about goods trade , customs tariffs reduction , the intellectual property rights ** and the work force mobility ** . 
   that is a world away from what everybody in the eu-not-called-adevland means when they say freedom of movement . 
  canada is not part of the eu . 
  there is no universal notion of free trade or freedom of movement . 
  these are negotiated for countries that are not part of the eu . 
  ceta allows for visa free travel including stays for up to 12 months and limited free trade . 
  both are limited . 
  both exist . 
  after the 12 months are over you can either come back for another 12 months , or have the duration extended if you work there . 
  read the official ceta document . 
  i 'm not making this up . 
   here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
  somehow you refuse to accept these facts . 
  that 's your problem , not mine . 
  auto-correct must be really fun . 
   the conservative party manifesto ruled out repealing or replacing the human rights act `` while the process of brexit is under way , '' although it said consideration will be given to the uk 's `` human rights legal framework '' when brexit concludes .
