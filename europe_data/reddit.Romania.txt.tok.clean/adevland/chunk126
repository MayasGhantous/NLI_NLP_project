  you could probably argue that they 're trying to use it as leverage in the negotiations . 
  basic human rights . 
  as leverage . 
  let that sink in . 
   competition commissioner sees agreement with canada as model but says deal with brexit uk would be different even ceta has freedom of movement for all eu and canadian citizens in the form of visa free travel for vacations and work with stays of up to 12 months that can be extended . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** . 
  this is true even for romania , which is usually left out of these things . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  regarding ceta , the free trade agreement between eu and canada , he says that ** romania is positioned to benefit directly of all the ceta fields ** , whether it 's about goods trade , customs tariffs reduction , the intellectual property rights ** and the work force mobility ** . 
   because of a new ** law restricting foreign ownership in russian media companies ** , the german group axel springer was forced to sell off its shares in forbes and other assets in russia . 
  negotiations with potential buyers lasted several months , concluding in late 2015 . 
  initially , it was assumed that 20 percent of the company would remain with general director regina von flemming , preserving a certain level of continuity with the previous owner . 
  ** the deal fell through , however , and the businessman alexander fedotov ended up buying 100 percent of forbes . 
  ** according to meduza 's sources , ** fedotov immediately started meddling in editorial policy , demanding the removal of various news stories . 
  ** chief editor elmar murtazaev refused to do this , and in no time he left forbes `` for personal reasons '' in mid-january 2016 . 
  just like in the good old days of communism . 
   the absolute same reason why eu countries and usa are sending weapons and training troops in the middle east or in europe the us and the eu did n't annex territories from other european countries . 
  russia literally sent troops and tanks to hold crimea at gun point while it `` democratically '' voted to join russia . 
  all those who opposed this were either killed or went missing . 
   russia is not interested in ukraine joining nato , or even keeping its current government , so it does what it can to disrupt that . 
  wow ... so you 're admitting russia is disrupting another sovereign country . 
  if ukraine is interested in joining nato and/or the eu , russia should mind its own business . 
   there was not a single civil war in history ( well , that may be an exaggeration , but at least 99 % of them ) without some kind of foreign help for one or both of the sides . 
  you already admitted that russia is intentionally disrupting ukraine because it does n't want it in nato . 
  the civil war is a bs excuse . 
   syria alone has a much higher scale of foreign intervention . 
  do you condemn that , too ? 
  in syria all foreign countries are cooperating to fight isis . 
  that 's the goal . 
  do you support isis ? 
  even russia hates isis . 
   if it was in russian interests , both donetsk and lugansk would 've been annexed in 2014 , and noone could 've done anything about it . 
  thanks for proving that russia is a war mongering state . 
  this discussion is over . 
  that depends on your point of view . 
  owning part of the enemy 's infrastructure can have valuable intelligence potential . 
  not to mention bragging rights . 
   russia tried a lot , but it was always one-sided will [ russia mocks u.s. in ` election interference ' april fool 's post ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/russia-mocks-u-s-election-interference-april-fool-post-article-1.3016325 )  `` to arrange a call from a russian diplomat to your political opponent , press 1 , '' the recording begins , in russian and english . 
  press 2 `` to use the services of russian hackers , '' and 3 `` to request election interference . '' such try . 
  much good will . 
  very one sided . 
   west leaders support russophobic laws when russian laws go against democracy , all democratic laws are russophobic . 
   and arrange revolutions near our borders those are not only your borders . 
  if people in a neighboring country are revolting , that 's none of russia 's business . 
  as of 2014 , vk is owned by kremlin connected companies .

  all of these companies are directly connected with the russian government . 
  ** ukraine is in a de facto war with russia . 
  this is a war time embargo . 
  ** this is not unprecedented . 
  [ google analytics blocked in cuba because of us sanctions ] ( https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/21/3105443/google-analytics-blocked-cuba-us-sanctions ),

  this is how you achieve unity . 
  ** the us does n't have a free trade deal with the eu . 
  ** trump cancelled all ttip talks when he came to office . 
  the us has visa free travel to all eu countries . 
  us citizens are not allowed to work or stay for long periods of time in the eu without special visas . 
  so yeah , you can not have free trade with the eu without freedom of movement . 
   til canada is a member of the single market i never said that . 
  why are you assuming this ? 
  canada is not in the eu . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** .

  the free trade and freedom of movement are different from those within the eu . 
  not all tariffs are removed from trade and while all eu citizens get visa free travel for vacations and work , their stay in canada is limited in duration . 
  the point is the same as before . 
  you can not have free trade without freedom of movement . 
  the freedom of trade and movement do n't have to be absolute as within the eu . 
  they are negotiated with every non eu country , are directly proportional to one another and are reciprocal . 
   there is plenty of ways of fighting against propaganda , and just blocking the access to source of information is the worst option . 
  vk is not a source of information . 
  it 's a russian state controlled social networking platform that censors anti russian content and promotes pro russian propaganda . 
  under normal peace time circumstances i would agree with you , but people are dying because of pro russian separatists and russian weapons . 
  ukraine is systematically banning anything that is made in russia because of the conflict . 
  that 's an embargo . 
  it includes software and it prohibits us companies from doing business in iran . 
  this includes google , fb and twitter . 
  here 's an interesting precedent from 2012 : [ google analytics blocked in cuba because of us sanctions ] ( https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/21/3105443/google-analytics-blocked-cuba-us-sanctions ) is that censorchip on the part of the us , or just a trade embargo ? 
  ukraine is doing the same thing to russia . 
   as far as i understand , its not a news website with articles published by state journalists . 
  it 's heavily monitored and moderated by the russian state . 
   founder pavel durov was dismissed as ceo in april 2014 after he had failed to retract a ( according to himself ) prank april fools letter of resignation . 
  durov then claimed the company had been effectively taken over by vladimir putin 's allies and suggested his ousting was the result of his refusal to hand over personal details of users to the russian federal security service and his refusal to shut down a vk group dedicated to anti-corruption activist alexei navalny . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_ ( social_networking ) #founder _ pavel_durov .27 s_dismissal the site has been sold in 2014 to russian state controlled companies . 
   they probably have a lot of political oriented groups with pro-russian rhetoric , etc , but so does fb . 
  fb is not owned by a russian state controlled company . 
  fb does n't remove anti russian articles while automatically promoting pro russian articles . 
  vk does that . 
   does it matter to me if company is state owned , if all i do there is chat with my friends and look at funny gifs ? 
  it matters if you live in ukraine . 
  the banning of vk and other russian software is a wartime embargo meant to stop the ongoing conflict in ukraine . 
  people are still being killed by pro russian separatists using weapons and artillery from the russian government . 
   so far it just looks like budget version of fb , and nobody tried to shove any pro-russian propaganda in my face . 
  disappointing :( are you from ukraine ? 
  do you speak russian ? 
  if it did n't happen to you in the first 5 minutes after creating the account , it does n't mean it does n't happen at all . 
  again , this is a war time embargo on russian software . 
  ukraine also no longer uses russian gas . 
  other countries are doing the same .
