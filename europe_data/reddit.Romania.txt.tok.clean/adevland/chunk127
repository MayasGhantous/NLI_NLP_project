  russia is waging a de facto war in ukraine . 
  these bans are sanctions against the russian government . 
   i see well by your definition we have free movement with half the world currently so under those terms i dont expect an issue  these are not my standards . 
  honest . 
   these are examples based on existing trade deals between the eu and other non eu countries like canada . 
  the only point i 'm trying to make here is that free trade , regardless of how `` free '' it is , can not happen without freedom of movement with the same degree of `` freedom '' . 
  as you said yourself , these are not black and white concepts . 
  the degree of `` freedom '' is negotiated . 
  that is all . 
   avdiivka is not in crimea . 
  it 's in ukraine . 
  people are getting killed in ukraine by pro russian separatists using russian weapons . 
   separatists are not russian en masse . 
  they do have help from russia they 're not russians , but they fight for russia using russian weapons . 
   russians do n't need to separate from ukraine , they are already in a different country . 
  why is russia invading another country ? 
  why is russia sending weapons to pro russian separatists in ukraine ? 
  your apologetic rhetoric is pathetic . 
  you even admit russia is supplying weapons that kill people in a foreign country . 
  it 's not even in crimea . 
  it 's in ukraine 's territory . 
  is russia going to `` peacefully '' annex donetsk as well ? 
   russians are not shelling anyone at crimea . 
  [ aftermath of separatist shelling of avdiivka that left 4 civilians dead and another seriously injured ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3kftia_2n4 ) that 's from 3 days ago . 
   so should everything be blocked that can influence people 's opinions ? 
  this is clearly a blow for freedom of information , and towards censorship , and can not be considered good . 
  those are state controlled russian companies . 
  there is no freedom of information . 
  only pro russian propaganda is allowed on vk and yandex . 
  [ how putin 's cronies seized control of russia 's facebook ] ( https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/31/5363990/how-putins-cronies-seized-control-over-russias-facebook-pavel-durov-vk ) ** it 's owned by companies controlled by the russian government . 
  ** [ how a putin fan overseas pushed pro-trump propaganda to americans ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/17/world/europe/russia-propaganda-elections.html ) [ how russian propaganda spreads online ] ( https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/ukraine-nuclear-radiation-russia-propaganda/ ) [ russia : troll factory propaganda ] ( https://medium.com/@dariasukharchuk/russsia-troll-factory-propaganda-e48c07343997 )  the question about yandex remains open also . 
  [ russian search engine yandex announces that unregistered media will disappear from search results ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-update-october-21-2016/ )  yandex announced that media that is not registered with roskomnadzor , the state media monitoring agency will see its stories disappear from the front page of yandex news as well as regional and subject pages russian has special laws obligating all websites to register with the government . 
  all content is filtered and censored . 
  there is no freedom of speech on those sites . 
  also , there is a de facto war between russia and ukraine . 
  this is an embargo . 
  other countries do this as well . 
  the us has banned all commercial trade with iran since 1979 . 
  this includes computer software . 
   also , `` partial freedom of movement '' does n't exist , what is in ceta is just a commitment to facilitated immigration procedures for certain people . 
  this is false . 
  ceta does n't imply immigration . 
  people can go on vacation or work in both canada and the eu for temporary durations only . 
  the `` free trade '' is also not completely free . 
  seriously , read the document . 
  you 're talking about things you do not understand . 
   not even removal of visas or application of these rules to all workers again , you are false . 
  ceta implies visa free travel and temporary stays for all citizens of the eu and canada between the two entities . 
  you 're making up falsehoods even though i 've shown you the official document . 
  this discussion is over . 
   imagine if your government banned facebook and google . 
  google and facebook are not owned by companies controlled by a government that is killing people in my country . 
  that 's what russia is doing in ukraine . 
   oh so in about 5 years time the annexation is gon na be alright because it happened in 2014 the point is that russia is still shelling ukraine . 
  people are still dying . 
  there is a de facto war going on . 
  why are you ignoring it ? 
   but the annexation of crimea happened 3 years ago , how is that relevant today ? 
  russia is still shelling ukraine . 
  people are still dying . 
   now that you seem to have admitted you were wrong in the first place about all that , where does that leave us ? 
  where did i admit that ? 
  these are not my claims . 
  these are official statements by the eu . 
  why are you ignoring these facts ? 
   there will , of course , be limited ` freedom of movement ' in the non-technical eu sense with the eu once the uk leaves . 
  you have created a strawman to argue about . 
  dude , i did n't create ceta . 
  that 's how all non eu countries deal with the eu , through separate negotiations that involve both free trade and freedom of movement ; both of the same degree . 
  it 's not a strawman . 
  it 's how ceta works . 
  i gave you the example of canada and the official ceta document . 
  ceta has both limited free trade and freedom of movement with limited stay for all eu members . 
  you falsely claimed that canada had free trade without any freedom of movement . 
  you got proven wrong . 
  ** then you shifted the goal post to how freedom of movement with canada is not the same as in the eu although you already know that canada is not part of the eu and claimed that not all eu countries have access . 
  you got proven wrong again . 
  ** you brought absolutely nothing to this discussion other than bitterness and hate . 
  read the documents if you wish , or live in ignorance . 
  it 's your choice . 
  this discussion is over . 
   when people talk about freedom of movement in the context of the eu and brexit they mean this ** the uk will no longer be in the eu . 
  those rules will no longer apply . 
  ** a new trade deal will have to be made . 
  ** what part of this ca n't you understand ? 
  ** that new deal can have partial free trade with partial freedom of movement just like with canada . 
  you ca n't have one without the other . 
  the eu is clear about this . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
   `` there will be no access to the internal market for those who do not accept the rules -- without exception or nuance -- that make up the very nature of the internal market system , '' juncker said . 
  you can not have one without the other . 
  the two do not have to be absolute as with the other eu states . 
  ** the uk can choose to do it like canada who has partial free trade for partial freedom of movement . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_european_union canada is not in the eu . 
  neither will the uk . 
  a new trade agreement will be in place . 
  if the uk wants any form of free trade , it will have to agree to a directly proportionate freedom of movement . 
  that 's the official eu statement . 
  end of story . 
   when you read that the uk does n't want free movement the comments you are reading apply only to this .
