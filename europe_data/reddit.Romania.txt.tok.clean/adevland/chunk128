  when you hear the eu saying no single market access without freedom of movement they are referring to this and only to this . 
  this is false . 
  here 's the official eu statement . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
   `` there will be no access to the internal market for those who do not accept the rules -- without exception or nuance -- that make up the very nature of the internal market system , '' juncker said . 
  you can not have one without the other . 
  the two do not have to be absolute as with the other eu states . 
  ** the uk can choose to do it like canada who has partial free trade for partial freedom of movement . 
   this is what eu freedom of movement involves : why are you even comparing canada to other eu states ? 
  canada is not part of the eu . 
  ceta involves less free trade and less free labor movement . 
  ceta has been negotiated for years . 
  there is no absolute version of free trade or freedom of movement . 
  they differ based on each deal with every other non eu country . 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic on the issue . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  regarding ceta , the free trade agreement between eu and canada , he says that ** romania is positioned to benefit directly of all the ceta fields ** , whether it 's about goods trade , customs tariffs reduction , the intellectual property rights ** and the work force mobility ** . 
  ...  the freedom of movement the uk is rejecting is the right of permanent stay , not temporary entry , which nobody has even called into question . 
  if the uk is ok with a ceta type of deal , then that can happen . 
   you were banging on about this nonsense the other day and refusing to be educated about it . 
  dude , that 's the official ceta document . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   this is not the case with canada and ` freedom of movement ' was not a condition of the free trade agreement . 
  this is false . 
  seriously , you 're making up completely bs statements without even trying to prove them . 
  you 're literally pulling them out of your ass . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** .

  the uk can get less free trade if they agree to less free labor movement . 
  the two need to be directly proportionate . 
  that 's how ceta works . 
  freedom of movement is limited to temporary stays , but so is free trade . 
  there are still some tariffs and regulations left . 
  it 's not completely free . 
   what i was thinking was `` tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services '' from what i understand they have limited access to services for example ? 
  what services ? 
  free trade means no trade tariffs . 
  plain and simple . 
  the eu made it clear that free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  both these aspects can be negotiated , but one can not happen without the order . 
  it makes sense , because in order for trade to happen , labor needs to happen . 
  and having non free labor movement , means to have burdened trade . 
   as a side note it 's quite likely the uk might agree to that highly reduced form of free movement , especially when it seems either side gets to set their requirements ? 
  yep . 
  the uk can get less free trade if they agree to less free labor movement . 
  the two need to be directly proportionate . 
  that 's how ceta works . 
  freedom of movement is limited to temporary stays , but so is free trade . 
  there are still some tariffs and regulations left . 
  it 's not completely free . 
   temporary entry and stay for business purposes is not the same thing as freedom of movement . 
  freedom of movement is limited to temporary stays because free trade is n't fully free either . 
  most tariffs are gone , but not all of them . 
   it does n't give every single eu citizen the right to live and work in canada and vice versa . 
  all eu citizens can go to canada for tourism or work . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** .

   this certainly is n't what canada is getting is it ? 
  unless i 've missed something ( entirely possible ) ? 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
   freedom of movement ( in the sense of the eu 's single market ) has never been a requirement for tariff-free trade , point . 
  it 's your word against that of the eu . 
  you also have no proof to uphold it . 
  all free trade agreements between the eu and all other non eu countries involves some form of freedom of movement . 
  the recent ceta agreement with canada is proof of this . 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
   canada has a free trade agreement with the eu yet they 're not in the single market canada has ceta . 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement .

  no they have n't . 
  single market membership and a fta are not the same thing . 
  you can have a free trade agreement without being in the single market . 
  this is a common misconception in the uk . 
  seriously , read the article . 
    he said the eu would not grant tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
   `` there will be no access to the internal market for those who do not accept the rules -- without exception or nuance -- that make up the very nature of the internal market system , '' juncker said . 
  common unemployment insurance ? 
  so that i can write anti eu propaganda whenever i want and get paid by the eu to do so ? 
  what a great idea !, 
   all items here are recounted fake ( until proven otherwise ) and written in a humorous purpose . 
  the use of names of persons or companies is purely satirical here . 
   that 's only true if the uk decides to seek agreements in areas involving non-direct foreign investment and the investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms , as it says in the telegraph article . 
  the uk still needs the ok of all 27 eu governments on every other issue . 
   any trade pact with britain would need to be signed off in brussels by all 27 eu governments after brexit , but the ecj ruling implies that , depending on the deal , national parliaments would also get a veto . 
  and even if there was no veto vote , the uk still has to negotiate with the eu as they did until now . 
  and the eu already made it clear that there can not be any free trade without freedom of movement . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ ) ** the uk can not have benefits without any responsibility . 
  ** this whole cat and mouse game is a waste of time . 
   so you are fine with china banning west websites like facebook , google & co because they are propaganda ? 
  ... i mean its same shit the problem there is that there is no anti china propaganda on fb or google . 
  and the sites themselves have no anti china agenda . 
  china banned them to push the usage of their own state controlled versions that actually have propaganda . 
  this thing can go both ways . 
  the misleading articles are pouring in , as expected . 
   `` the court of justice says all services - even transport - can be ratified by a qualified majority vote , which is potentially quite a big opening for the uk , '' said steve peers , professor of eu law at essex university .
