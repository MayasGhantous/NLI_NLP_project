  `` it could certainly make things easier . '' no mention of the veto clause . 
  here 's another article by a more reputable news agency : [ not so fast : eu court ensures 32 vetoes on brexit trade ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-trade-iduskcn18c0ya )  britain may have to wait - and hope - for every single one of its european union neighbors to give full legislative consent before it can fully benefit from any post-brexit free trade deal , eu judges ruled on tuesday . 
  i 'll take a wild guess about which story will be overwhelmingly printed in uk tabloids . 
  we probably both know the answer to this . 
   so we are in situation where the creditors have been able to dictate to greece what is , in their eyes , the proper economic policy . 
  it is failing ... false . 
  the eu did not dictate how greece manages its economy . 
  it gave them money and objectives . 
  it was up to greece if and how it was supposed to achieve those objectives . 
  greece took all that money and did not achieve the objectives they promised to achieve . 
  ** you 're acting as if greece did everything that the eu told them to do . 
  this is not the case . 
  ** there are plenty of reforms still pending from the first bailout that were carried over to the second and which will be carried over to the third . 
   dude , you just used bold font as an argument did you read the text in the bold font ? 
  are you bold font sensitive or just suffering from selective ignorance ? 
  read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bg8zu/ukraine_blocks_the_countrys_popular_social/dhmj1y5/ ) . 
  warning : there 's some bold font at the end . 
  the embargo started in 1979 after the iranian revolution when radical muslims got the power . 
  iran is also sanctioned for having a nuclear missile program . 
  the us also has economic sanctions in place for russia for the annexation of crimea . 
  these are all present day issues . 
  the embargoes are meant to deter these countries from their actions to either develop nuclear weapons or to deter them from annexing foreign territories at gun point . 
   what carrier ? 
  orange romania . 
  i got the message on 9 may saying that from 15 june all sms and voice calls from the eu will happen as if they originated from romania . 
  the same goes for data usage with it being capped at a value that will be disclosed on 15 june . 
  this is pretty neat . 
  thanks , eu . 
   they are still forced to pursue one that suits the moral sensitivities of the lenders . 
  greece fucked up . 
  they got money along with guidelines on how to use that money . 
  just giving them money after they clearly lied and fucked up , is not a good idea . 
  even with guidelines , they still managed to eat up the bailouts with no visible overall progress . 
  their gdp is still fluctuating between positive and negative growth . 
   as a result , their gdp per capita has been dropping steadily . 
  their problems are their own . 
  you 're trying to blame their problems on those that offered them help . 
  greece agreed to those terms . 
  they asked for the bailouts . 
  they had national referendums on the bailouts . 
   i made a statement about the aftermath of the crisis and the effect of austerity . 
  you make a statement about the cause of the crisis ... how is that relevant ? 
  the crisis happened because of internal greek policies and official lies . 
  if the greeks did n't lie about their loans , they would have recovered just like everyone else . 
  it 's not the fault of the eu that greek officials lied about external loans . 
  do not blame greece 's troubles on others but themselves . 
   oh , i 'm terribly sorry , i did n't realise you 're mentally challenged . 
  have a nice day !, 
  insulting me does n't change the facts . 
   show us the difference between vk the propaganda machine and fb the social network . 
  ** vk is owned by companies controlled by the russian government .

  only pro russian government sites are allowed . 
  no anti russian government site is listed in the top results . 
  that 's propaganda grade content filtering . 
  the law itself is meant to silence dissent . 
   so , to reiterate : how exactly it makes vk a `` propaganda machine '' ? 
  show us some examples of how kremlin uses vk for propaganda .

  ** ukraine is in a de facto war with russia . 
  this is a war time embargo . 
   obviously , you need to measure gdp by ppp , with that in mind , ukraine 's gdp is bigger than greece ' gdp . 
  obviously , you 're still wrong . 
  gdp by ppp is [ 24094 $ for greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) while only [ 7456 $ for ukraine ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) . 
  the difference here is more than 3 times bigger . 
  check your facts !, 
   russia does not sell any gas to ukraine ( by ukraine volition ) . 
  and now ukraine has added russian state controlled sites and software to the embargo . 
  these things will continue . 
  and not just in ukraine . 
  [ europe seeks alternatives to russian gas imports ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/energy-environment/european-union-seeks-to-reduce-reliance-on-russian-gas.html ),

  this is about a war time embargo . 
  the austerity fanatics are saying so so you 're claiming that eu countries can print more euros whenever they want ? 
  really ? 
  this is false . 
  only the european central bank has this authority . 
   they were n't bailed out , as the austerity fanatics were very eager to point out . 
  they just got loans . 
  you 're debating semantics . 
  they got huge loans at low interest rates . 
  that 's a bailout . 
   the imf , from its part , has long since recognized that all that austerity is hamstringing the greek recovery and is actually the cause of greece 's current high debt-to-gdp by unnecessarily reducing economic activity . 
  you 're misguided . 
  [ greek government-debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis )  the greek crisis started in late 2009 , triggered by the turmoil of the great recession , structural weaknesses in the greek economy , and ** revelations that previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been undercounted by the greek government ** . 
  the greek government literally lied about their external debt to get even more debt . 
   the economy is also not small , it 's on a scale similar to austria or greece . 
  this is false . 
  ukraine has a gdp of [ 90.62 billion usd ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/gdp ) . 
  greece has a gdp of [ 194.85 billion usd ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp ) . 
  that 's more than twice the gdp of ukraine . 
   also , the very premise that ukraine cuts lifeline ties with russia as it sees fit shows that russia is quite benevolent to ukraine sure , bro . 
  russia just gives that gas away for free .
