  they make no profit from it . 
  such benevolent rulers . 
   and us has recently altered boarders of serbia recently ? 
  ** the kosovo war ended in 1999 . 
  facebook literally did n't exist in 1999 . 
   google and fb are the two most powerful tools of modern intelligence gathering . 
  i repeat . 
  ukraine is not at war with the us . 
  google and fb are us companies . 
  ukraine banned vk because it 's literally controlled by the russian government that is shelling ukraine borders and annexed ukraine territory at gun point . 
  this is a state of war . 
   please explain how exactly vk or yandex is a `` propaganda machine '' as of 2014 , vk is owned by kremlin connected companies . 
  [ founder of vkontakte leaves after dispute with kremlin-linked owners ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/02/founder-pavel-durov-leaves-russian-social-network-site-vkontakte ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_ ( social_networking ) #founder _ pavel_durov .27 s_dismissal  durov then claimed ** the company had been effectively taken over by vladimir putin 's allies ** and suggested his ousting was the result of his refusal to hand over personal details of users to the russian federal security service and his refusal to shut down a vk group dedicated to anti-corruption activist alexei navalny . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/kaspersky-and-russian-spies-2015-3  `` the company 's connections to the kremlin have long been known and reported on , but bloomberg reports that several executives have been replaced with people closely aligned with russia 's military and intelligence operations . '', 
  all of these companies are directly connected with the russian government . 
   google and fb are basically cia controlled now , that is one of main tools of modern intelligence gathering . 
  ukraine is not at war with the us . 
  ukraine is in a de facto war with russia . 
  this is an embargo . 
  the us has an embargo on iran trade since 1979 . 
  this includes banning the sales and purchases of software to and from iran . 
   that 's not really the point , because the point in question was the country 's origin , not the date . 
  this is exactly the point . 
  it 's about war time measures to fight propaganda and to stop trade with the attacker . 
  it 's an embargo . 
  russia annexed crimea from ukraine at gun point while shelling their borders to this day . 
  russia altered the borders of ukraine when it annexed crimea . 
  they altered a country . 
  this embargo should have happened a long time ago . 
  theresa may and nigel farage are going to love this . 
  i was referring to their economy . 
  i 've edited my previous comment for clarity . 
  fb is n't owned by a russian state controlled company like vk is . 
  your mind keeps ignoring this fact . 
   yes , i mean i am using reddit right now and i have a facebook account , both of them from the us yet they actually shelled my country . 
  is the us currently shelling your country ? 
  ** the kosovo war ended in 1999 . 
  facebook literally did n't exist in 1999 . 
  ** facebook was created in 2004 . 
   the war is against the government , not the people do you think governments shy away from using people as leverage during a war ? 
  propaganda is a very dangerous tool . 
  saying it is n't is just more propaganda . 
   so most people actually did n't even get that the problem was essentially a banking one . 
  clearly . 
  my point was that people always blame the eu and euro , while ignoring the preexisting problems that greece had and the huge blow dealt by the 2008 crisis that originated in the us and affected the entire planet . 
  that is it . 
   again , vk is literally a russian facebook , you said it 's a propaganda machine . 
  vk is . 
  as of 2014 , it 's owned by kremlin connected companies . 
  [ founder of vkontakte leaves after dispute with kremlin-linked owners ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/02/founder-pavel-durov-leaves-russian-social-network-site-vkontakte ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_ ( social_networking ) #founder _ pavel_durov .27 s_dismissal  durov then claimed ** the company had been effectively taken over by vladimir putin 's allies ** and suggested his ousting was the result of his refusal to hand over personal details of users to the russian federal security service and his refusal to shut down a vk group dedicated to anti-corruption activist alexei navalny . 
   the solutions we the eu gave them were frankly bad as they 've been following them and they do n't really give that good a result . 
  the eu did n't really give greece any solutions . 
  mostly money . 
  the eu did n't interfere with how that money was spent . 
  the eu ca n't really directly interfere because it 's not a federation . 
  i , personally , suspect rampant local corruption as the culprit for how greece manages to go back down after each bailout . 
  also , things have been very slowly improving in sine graph type of manner . 
  the recent blunders of turkey are going to push more tourism the way of greece . 
  that will certainly help . 
  they 'll eventually break even and go on having constant growth . 
  facebook is not blocked in ukraine . 
  vk is . 
  vk is a russian owned site run by a state controlled company . 
  most of them are . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/kaspersky-and-russian-spies-2015-3  `` the company 's connections to the kremlin have long been known and reported on , but bloomberg reports that several executives have been replaced with people closely aligned with russia 's military and intelligence operations . '', 
  ** these are essentially embargo measures since ukraine is in a de facto war with russia . 
  ** the us bans nearly all trade to and from iran since 1979 . 
  this includes all forms of computer software . 
   i can look into it later in detail but i do n't think it 's really the point of our argument . 
  ^ true , that 's not the point . 
  printing money is usually the quick and dirty solution to economical problems . 
  you literally pay your debts with money that did n't exist a week ago . 
  that 's what the us always does and it works because most international trade happens in us dollars . 
  and guess who has the authority to print us dollars ? 
   other countries ca n't afford to abuse this because it will devalue their currency and trade will move elsewhere . 
  having a central monetary is a good idea . 
  the only reason people bring up against it is that countries can not print more money in case of economic failure . 
  how about reforming the economy so that it does n't fail ? 
  or think of better solutions ? 
  people are literally complaining about not being able to fuck up their economy even more . 
   hum ... 
  except i 'm buying it to use ice cream that then i sell and make a profit off . 
  correct . 
  but that 's entirely different from printing more money . 
  loans do not deflate the currency . 
  if taken with measure , they can boost the economy . 
  ** loans are entirely different from printing more money . 
  ** that 's the point . 
   first off the banks never learn because they 're greedy by nature the government should be able to put them in line via regulations , but you 'd need an honest government . 
  the greek government lied about their external debt to get more debt . 
  that 's how their problems started in the first place . 
  [ greek government-debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis )  the greek crisis started in late 2009 , triggered by the turmoil of the great recession , structural weaknesses in the greek economy , and revelations that previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been undercounted by the greek government . 
   but ukraine did not ban imports from russia . 
  they 're still importing a lot of things from russia . 
  [ ukraine stops buying natural gas from russia , closes airspace ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukraine-stops-buying-natural-gas-from-russia-closes-airspace/article27474757/ ) [ ukraine ` happy ' to pay eu gas price in move away from russia ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/ukraine-happy-to-pay-eu-gas-premium-in-move-away-from-russia ) these things will probably only further escalate . 
  they 're gradual because ukraine has a fragile economy and has to find other import/export streams before completely cutting away russia . 
  more and more countries are also doing this . 
  the eu plans to completely stop relying on russian gas . 
  the us has strict economical sanctions on russia . 
  it 's not just about banning social networking sites and accounting software .
