  romania would n't benefit from those bail-out funds . 
  spain and greece would . 
  greece has already been bailed out twice and it 's only made things worse every single time . 
  the gdp has plummeted after every bailout . 
  ** bailouts do not work . 
  that 's the point . 
  ** being a dick about it and pointing fingers at other countries that have ok economies wo n't fix your own problems . 
   spain barely receives money from the eu unlike romania . 
  romania actually has economic growth . 
  and that 's because foreign investments due to the free eu market . 
  most direct eu funds are being refunded to the eu because they are not used . 
  bureaucracy makes it hard for people to get them . 
  also , this is not what spain is talking about . 
  they literally want emergency bail-out funds for countries that have failing economies . 
  also # 2 , the direct amount of money countries receive and contribute are very small in comparison to the indirect huge amounts of money that are being traded on the open market . 
  western eu always shuns romania for taking more money than it contributes , but it never complains about cheap romanian labor . 
  you 're literally cherry picking your arguments . 
   euro made recovery for southern countries much slower after 2008 crisis because they could n't just inflate their currency . 
  all the other euro zone countries , besides greece , have recovered a long time ago . 
  and they 've done this without inflating their currency because they also use the euro . 
  this is a bs excuse . 
  spain and greece had long standing problems that preceded the 2008 crisis and even the adoption of the euro . 
  the 2008 crisis only made them worse . 
  the greek government literally lied about their external debt to get even more loans while spain had a housing bubble way before 2008 . 
  people always ignore these things because it 's easier to just blame it on the euro , even thought other countries that use the euro managed just fine . 
  heck , germany has a budget surplus for 3 years in a row . 
  they also faced the 2008 crisis and they also use the euro . 
  france , italy and pretty much all other euro zone countries have recovered while also using the euro . 
  you 're literally blaming spain and greece 's problems on things that are common to other countries that do not have these problems . 
  this only shows that you have a limited comprehension of the local long standing problems that spain and greece have had for a very long time before switching to the euro . 
   you can take the dumbfuckistan english . 
  thanks for being a dick and , once again , proving my point . 
    [ analog in the pocket oxford dictionary and thesaurus ] ( https://books.google.ro/books?id=fue0bazkcxac&amp;pg=pa27&amp;lpg=pa27&amp;dq=oxford+dictionary+analog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pvs3qrkkoi&amp;sig=9jxrrzqbkz2clmr-ajnfwrufsy4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj69rom3phtahuibvakhb4gao4q6aeiqdag#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20dictionary%20analog&amp;f=false ) [ here ] ( http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/analogue_1#analogue_1__10 ) it is again in the online version of the oxford dictionary . 
   ( british english also analog ) ( of a clock or watch ) showing the time using hands on a dial and not with a display of numbers so the official oxford dictionary says that both versions are ok in british english . 
  how are them apples ? 
   resort to ad hominem and ran away . 
  that 's a win for me . 
  if you think being a dick is `` winning '' , you 're only proving my point . 
  both versions of analog/analogue are correct . 
  [ analog or analogue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/analog ) you might as well randomly choose to use 17th century english and ignore the fact that languages evolve over time . 
  [ analog ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/analog#etymology )  early 19th century ; ** from french analogue ** , from ancient greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ( an\u00e1logos , `` proportionate '' ) , from \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac ( an\u00e1 , `` up to '' ) + \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ( l\u00f3gos , `` ratio '' ) . 
  analogue is the french word . 
  it 's natural that its spelling would change over time since french spelling does n't work the same as english spelling . 
   you ca n't handle extra letters , that 's fine with me . 
  simple language for simple people . 
  there 's no need to get angry and insult me over extra letters , bro . 
  seriously , you 're letting this get to you . 
  you 're letting a `` simple '' person get to you . 
   spain , on the contrary , wants deep reforms that will lead to more than just a shared currency : in this future scenario , ** member states will share an anti-crisis budget ** , unemployment insurance , a treasury , euro-bonds and a true banking union .

   europe 's recent recession `` revealed critical errors in the design of the euro '' what recent crisis ? 
  the 2008 crisis that started in the us ? 
  the one that affected the entire planet and not just the euro zone ? 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic . 
  this discussion is over . 
  we could be having the same discussion about color or colour . 
  both are correct . 
  you probably use the us version `` color '' just like everyone else . 
  after a quick online search , it seems that both variants are correct . 
  analogue is the legacy british version . 
   so who 's gon na pay for such crime ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is to acknowledge it so that it does n't happen again . 
  only far right opponents get hacked . 
  there are no hacks about trump or lepen and they both love russia and putin . 
  trump actually invited russia to hack hillary back in the campaign .

   but the people with a 2,5 k monthly income here still buy potatoes and going to a restaurant is more of a special occasion thing that 's my point . 
  they ca n't afford half the things mentioned in the video on a regular basis . 
  those high prices are for tourists and/or rich people . 
  the same thing goes for pretty much all capitals of the world . 
  even a broken analog clock is accurate twice a day . 
  capitals always have more rich people and that influences prices . 
  the basic commodities actually follow the same ratio because rich people do n't buy them . 
  rich people do n't buy potatoes . 
  they go to a restaurant . 
  average people rarely go to a fancy restaurant or buy barista coffee .

   i understand that most of you might disagree with that , but it seems weird to blame the pm of a country for following through with a democratically made decision by it 's people . 
  regardless of how people voted , one could argue that she 's doing a poor job at the brexit negotiations table . 
  seriously , she 's accusing the eu of stoking nationalism in ni while uk companies block imports from ni because they voted to remain . 
  who 's stoking who ? 
  that 's not how you get good trade deals for your country . 
  that 's being a sore loser . 
  you 're assuming that all of them voted based on objective assessments of what the eu did for the uk and not based on personal biased opinions and widely distributed anti eu tabloid propaganda . 
  this assumption is false . 
   for example here in finland , the parliament can transfer the executive authority/jurisdiction to eu if 2/3 of the parliament votes so . 
  this was actually added to the constitution . 
  did the eu force you to add it to the constitution ? 
  i highly doubt that . 
  if it 's been added , then your law makers did it . 
  you voted for them . 
  it 's their decision . 
  you 're blaming the eu for something that your own law makers did . 
   they decided to rapidly grow using finances they did n't have ( debt ) . 
  honestly , that 's how most big companies become big companies .
