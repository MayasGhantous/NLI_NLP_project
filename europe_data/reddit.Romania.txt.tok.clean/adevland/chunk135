  some just fail . 
  so the solution to fighting hack-based fake news is setting up honeypots of fake data for the unwitty hackers to find . 
  nota bene . 
  no , just the room number . 
  they know on which network hub they are . 
  they need to know the room number so they can disconnect their internet and stop the fake dhcp server from issuing wrong ips to everyone . 
  they usually find them when they get denounced by other students/roommates . 
  this only erodes your credibility , bro . 
  you claim to have a problem and blame people without knowing for sure that it 's their fault or not . 
  when confronted about this , you degenerate in aggressive rhetoric and ultimately start to express yourself through memes meant to insult me . 
  you 've reached the kindergarten level of argumentation . 
   i have troubleshot the issue long before this discussion . 
  that 's what you do n't get . 
  so now it works ? 
  you 're complaining about something that works ? 
   did you read the last 2 times i mentioned they told me they do ? 
  calm down , bro . 
   you said they `` admitted blocking a wide arange of ports . 
  not just a few '' . 
  you also said that wow works . 
  this information is n't enough to conclude that your problem is due to the blocked ports because you do n't know what ports they block and because other blizzard games work . 
  you literally have no proof that your networking issues are due to blocked ports . 
  it could be blocked ips by blizzard as i said or something else . 
  you 're being intentionally obtuse and close-minded about a problem that you apparently do not understand while also being extremely negative towards the network admins , even though you do n't know for sure if it 's their fault . 
  i was actually trying to help you troubleshoot the issue , but you 're insisting on something you have no evidence about . 
  this discussion is over . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
  [ eurozone economy quietly outshines the us ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0bbc026a-ea12-11e6-967b-c88452263daf )  the eurozone economy has now posted 14 consecutive quarters of growth , the unemployment rate has returned into single digits , and economic sentiment has reached its highest level in six years . 
  the numbers contrast with common depictions of the eurozone economy as stagnant , sclerotic and perennially underperforming . 
   `` i certainly continue to be amazed by the skewed negativism towards europe , '' says erik nielsen , chief economist of unicredit , who says such views are `` mostly based on what seems like superficial attention to the data -- or , maybe , to ` ** alternative facts ** ' . '', 
   also , overwatch bans accounts , not ip 's . 
  [ blizzard banning players who ` nuke ' overwatch matches ] ( http://kotaku.com/blizzard-banning-players-who-nuke-overwatch-matches-1791176027 )  if one person 's ip gets targeted , everybody in the pc bang suffers . 
  the same thing happens in dorm rooms . 
  ips are shared between users . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that you do n't know for sure that the network admins are intentionally closing those ports . 
  they have no reason to do so . 
  these are random ports that are n't associated with any protocol . 
  you could be having a plethora of other networking issues that prevent you from connecting to overwatch games . 
   they did n't have time to ban my ip from first day . 
  your ip constantly changes . 
  you do n't always have the same ip . 
  many people share the same ip . 
   also , i can log in , however it will not connect me to a game . 
  the blizzard login service is used by all of their games . 
  you can login with the same username and password in all modern blizzard games . 
  it 's entirely possible that your ip is/was used by someone else that got it banned in overwatch . 
  are you the only one having this issue in the dorm ? 
   even the dorm admits they block ports here 's a [ list of ports ] ( https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/300479 ) that blizzard games and services use . 
  ask them is they are blocking any of those ports . 
  they should n't be . 
   it is easier to tear things down than it is to build them . 
  it is easier to blame others for your own problems than to deal with them yourself . 
  it 's also unimaginable for some to ask for outside help . 
  when the eu helps , it 's `` they 're taking away our national identity and sovereignty '' . 
  when the eu backs off , it 's `` they do n't give a shit about us '' . 
   most likely due to wow using a different protocol/port . 
  they are different games . 
  they use different ports and have different gms . 
  the bans are applied on ips and ports based on user behavior patterns . 
  overwatch is way more competitive than wow . 
  that leads to way more butthurt people after playing overwatch than those who farm chicken eggs in wow . 
  also , the bans are n't permanent . 
  they come and go based on how nice people are . 
  when i was a student , i occasionally played warcraft 3 . 
  during the holidays the battle.net service was almost always inaccessible . 
   but it blocks team speak for example ... not even gon na mention most online games ( despite they use a smaller bandwidth than youtube 480p ) these blocks are , for the most part , not because of the dorm internet limitations , but because ** the dorm internet ip ranges are blocked by those online games ** . 
  blizzard , for example , blocked the ips from the dorm room internet because students were doing all sorts of shady stuff like ddosing other players , phishing for their passwords , using cheats , etc. . 
  i 've lived in those dorms myself . 
  these limitations are based on continuous abuse from students that use their computers as torrent seeding machines that stay on 24/7 . 
  it has gotten to the point where you could n't send finished college assignments to professors via email . 
  during certain hours of the day , it was literally impossible to get any work done because of certain students that abused the bandwidth . 
  certain ports are blocked in order to prevent those living in the dorms from setting up servers that disrupt common services like email , ftp , ssh . 
  there were frequent cases in which some bored idiots would setup dhcp servers and fuck up the entire ip tables of the network so that nobody could access the internet . 
  these were malicious people that did this to troll everyone before exams and on weekends . 
  the network admins had to literally go from door to door until they found the culprits . 
  the service had no limits at first . 
  but they are necessary because some people just ca n't play nice with others . 
   the hacking lit up social media , especially in the united states , where far-right activists have joined together to spread extremist messages in europe . 
   on election day , the french-language version of sputnik , the russian news outlet , played up social media coverage of the leaks . 
   privatizing prisons now that 's a royal shit storm right there . 
  it 's pretty obvious . 
  those that believed it became antisemitic . 
  those that di n't became anti russian . 
   with a probably fractured parliament it depends ... 
  legislative elections are scheduled to take place on 11 and 18 june 2017 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_2017, 
   you 've been proved wrong several times in this thread actually , no . 
  i 've been insulted by those that could n't argue against me . 
  tl ; dr : you 're wrong because i say so . 
    you have such a strong belief that the eu has freedom of movement with canada then you should turn up on canadian soil without a job and see how free your movement is . 
  i 'm romanian . 
  starting with december this year we 'll be able to do just that . 
  and you do n't have to take my word for it . 
  here 's proof . 
  [ canada 's ambassador : all romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas starting december 1 ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/news/canadas-ambassador-all-romanian-citizens-can-travel-to-canada-without-visas-starting-december-1-134158 )  regarding ceta , the free trade agreement between eu and canada , he says that ** romania is positioned to benefit directly of all the ceta fields ** , whether it 's about goods trade , customs tariffs reduction , the intellectual property rights ** and the work force mobility ** . 
  feel free to ignore this and claim that i 'm wrong . 
  cheers , mate !, 
   get with the program , right now you 're saying things that would make you extremely unpopular with the very people you 're trying to defend . 
  blasphemer . 
  you seem mad that i have a point . 
   have a nice day .
