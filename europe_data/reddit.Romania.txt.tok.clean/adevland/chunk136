   these governments are not based on the quran and sharia . 
  how does that proof any of your points ? 
  you just acknowledged that `` these governments '' are based on extreme interpretations of islam , which is exactly what i was saying . 
  yet , even so , they bind together to fight the most extreme version of islam . 
  they are all fighting isis . 
  and isis is losing . 
   your claim that islamists fight the governments because said governments are too religiously extreme is pure bs oh , really ? 
  how about isis ? 
  pretty much all regimes in the region have allied against isis , which is the most extreme of them all . 
   except you did n't because that 's not freedom of movement . 
  as an eu citizen i upped sticks and moved to spain without a job and was allowed to live there . 
  freedom of movement is n't a black and white issue . 
  it has various forms even within the eu . 
  all eu countries have their own immigration policies . 
  also , canada is not part of the eu , so the eu rules do not apply . 
  the ceta rules apply , and they are different . 
  the free trade from ceta is also not the same as the free trade from within the eu , yet it 's still called free trade because most tariffs are gone . 
  certain rules and conditions , however , apply and they are different from those of the eu . 
  at this point you 're debating semantics over the definition of freedom of movement . 
  and this after you claimed there was no freedom of movement and you were proven wrong . 
  you have reached the bottom of the barrel with your argument . 
  free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  the two concepts are tied one to another . 
   you do realize islamists are the ones most vehemently opposed to the dictatorships and regimes in the me , right ? 
  exactly . 
  because those regimes use extreme interpretations of islam for profit and power . 
  this is exactly my point . 
   you 're so stupid . 
  this is at least the second time you 've insulted me . 
  are you ok ? 
   you are ignoring your own source when it contradicts you ? 
  how does it contradict me ? 
  it clearly says it 's based on interpretations from islamic texts . 
   [ sharia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia ) , sharia law , or islamic law is the religious law forming part of the islamic tradition . 
  ** it is derived from the religious precepts of islam ** , particularly the quran and the hadith . 
  in arabic , the term shar\u012b\u02bfah refers to god 's divine law and is contrasted with fiqh , which refers to its scholarly interpretations . 
  the manner of its application in modern times has been ** a subject of dispute ** between muslim traditionalists and reformists . 
  it clearly says it 's ** derived ** from islamic texts and because of that its application is widely ** disputed ** . 
  ** sharia is not islam . 
  it 's derived from it based on interpretations . 
  and that makes it highly disputed . 
   we 're just pointing out that there 's more terrorists in islam than is right . 
  this is true . 
  middle east countries are governed by dictatorships that use religious interpretations to manipulate poor and uneducated people for profit and power . 
   expect that catholicism takes responsibility to fix itself , islam just says `` fuck you islamaphobe '' that 's not islam . 
  those are dictatorship states like saudi arabia . 
  you 're ignoring the millions of muslims that do not go around blowing other people up and who do not try to force their religion upon others . 
  you 're judging an entire culture based on interpretations made popular by dictatorship states . 
  you 're shunning islam . 
  you should be shunning the dictatorships that promote extremist interpretations of islam . 
   you just generalized lol no . 
  i said they still have problems . 
  i did n't say that all catholic priests are pedophiles or anything like that . 
   slowly its secular nature is altered to resemble saudi arabia . 
  these are totalitarian states that use interpretations of religion to manipulate poor and uneducated people . 
  from the same page  now a great problem today is that a new movement within islam , the islamist movement , has innovated a non-traditional approach to shariah which vitiates all of the past approaches and establishes a rigid , hardline and non-pragmatic approach which vitiates all semblance of humaneness , sanity , moderation and decorum which constituted islamic law 's traditional implementation over the past 14 centuries of history . 
  and the very second paragraph which you ignored  islam is a complete package -- a complete message and way of life . 
  ** to fraction it into its component , then examine them individually ** , will yield little or no understanding of islam 's holistic whole . 
  inevitably aspects of islam examined separately , without a wide-ranging grasp of its totality , will be taken in a fragmented context , in which case ** aspects may take on the appearance of extremism ** . 
  this is exactly what you are doing . 
  you 're taking things out of context and interpreting them however you see fit . 
   there are of course few brave souls that challenge them , but often than not gets suppressed . 
  by generalizing you 're only discrediting their fight . 
   and trust me , the billions of adherents are not so liberal . 
  these are totalitarian governments that use religious interpretations to manipulate poor and uneducated people . 
  first of all , that site is anti muslim propaganda . 
   trop is a non-partisan , fact-based site which examines the ideological threat that islam poses to human dignity and freedom . 
  they claim to be non-partisan , but right off the bat they talk about `` ideological threats '' . 
  that 's not non-partisan . 
  secondly , [ unlike the bible , there is no mention of apostasy laws in the koran . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kashif-n-chaudhry/does-the-koran-endorse-ap_b_5539236.html )  the koran repeatedly mentions freedom of conscience as one of its basic tenets . 
  `` there is no compulsion in religion ( 2:256 ) , '' and `` let him who will believe and let him who will disbelieve ( 18:29 ) . '' thirdly , your quote is taken out of context . 
   qur ' anic exegetes al-baydawi and al-alusi explain that it refers to those pagan arabs who violated their peace treaties by waging war against the muslims . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sword_verse  it is a qur ` anic verse widely cited by critics of islam to suggest the faith promotes violence against `` pagans '' ( `` idolators '' , mushrikun ) , by isolating the portion of the verse `` fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them '' . 
   modern quranic scholar muhammad asad also states that the permission to fight and kill was restricted to specific tribes already at war with the muslims who had breached their peace agreements and attacked them first . 
  this only proves my point that all religion have extremist interpretations . 
   but there is nothing we can do . 
  this is false . 
  this attitude is why these things are happening . 
   sharia is not an extremist interpretation of islam , it 's the islamic law . 
  read the article . 
  sharia law is based on interpretations of islamic texts . 
   ** only several hundred verses of the quran have direct legal relevance , and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance ** , though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means . 
   do you know what temporary means ? 
  it means you switching goal posts . 
   you said canada has no freedom of movement deal . 
  i just proved you wrong . 
  have a nice day . 
   why does the eu not ask this of canada or the us , japan , mexico or australia ? 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
   it 's islam in its original form . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's derived from islam . 
  it 's an extreme interpretation . 
   it is derived from the religious precepts of islam , particularly the quran and the hadith . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia  also , you should stop attacking people with straw men . 
  nearly every post contains one . 
  what straw men ?
