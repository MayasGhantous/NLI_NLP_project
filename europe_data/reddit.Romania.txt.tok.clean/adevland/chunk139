   you still need visa even if you will get a sponsorship from canadian company this is false .

  are you trying to say that all muslims are terrorists ? 
  you 're generalizing . 
  not all muslims are terrorists that are ready and willing to kill `` infidels '' . 
  all religions have their extreme interpretations . 
  remember the crusades ? 
   could n't read ignorance is bliss . 
  enjoy yours . 
  it wo n't change the facts . 
   i linked you a very current source that goes into all the details . 
  people are being detained in turkey without a fair trial . 
  how did fire fighters , medics and teachers participate in the coup ? 
  thousands of people are being arrested . 
  if so many were truly involved , then how come the coup failed ? 
  ** these people are being arrested so that they can be replaced with erdogan loyalists . 
  ** [ teachers asked political questions in job interviews following purge ] ( https://www.turkishminute.com/2016/10/01/teachers-asked-political-questions-job-interviews-following-purge/ ), 
   there are so many mistakes here it 's palpable . 
  you 're either wilfully ignorant or you 're english langauge skills are just not very good . 
  tl ; dr : you 're wrong because i say so . 
   i am insulting you because you keep insulting every one on this sub i have n't insulted anyone . 
  this discussion is over . 
   you did n't bring any facts lol just an incorrect opinion xd seriously ? 
  why are you ignoring the official eu position ? 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant ** tariff-free ** access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
  that 's not my opinion . 
  that 's the official eu position on brexit . 
  this discussion is over . 
   found the picture in an article from 2016-04 , so your question makes , worryingly , a lot of sense  ) ) i do n't know if you 're joking or not , but i was actually being serious . 
  hundreds of people are being detained in turkey without a fair trial . 
   so which bit of temporary entry and business purposes do you not understand you fucking idiot ? 
  ** why are you insulting me ? 
  **  freedom of movement puts no limitations on people moving within the eu first of all , this is false . 
  there are limitations based on the immigration laws of each country from within the eu . 
  you ca n't just waltz in . 
  secondly , canada is not part of the eu . 
  freedom of movement differs from state to state even within the eu . 
  there is no one singular freedom of movement . 
  there are various types based on local immigration laws and general eu obligations for eu members . 
  canada is not a member of the eu . 
  their free trade is not the same as that from within the eu . 
  nor is their freedom of movement . 
  it 's all based on negotiations . 
  one can not exist without the other . 
  they are directly proportionate . 
   what kind of proof do you want ? 
  what possible proof i can show you of someone being in a cult ? 
  i did n't ask for proof of the existence of a cult . 
  i asked for proof that those who are being arrested are guilty . 
  there is none . 
  erdogan is arbitrarily arresting fire fighters , medics and even teachers by the hundreds . 
  this is the real coup . 
   please understand that when people use the phrase `` freedom of movement '' they are referring to one of the four `` fundamental freedoms '' of the eu that 's for eu member states . 
  canada is not an eu member . 
  canda does n't have the same free trade as that from within the eu . 
  the same goes for freedom of movement . 
  seriously , read the ceta document for yourself . 
  you 're being obtuse and debating semantics at this point . 
  you were completely denying any labor movement for ceta earlier . 
  you keep pushing the goal posts . 
  you 've lost this argument ages ago . 
  believe what you wish . 
  that wo n't change the fact that people from the eu can stay and work in canada and vice versa . 
  have a nice day . 
   canada does n't have freedom of movement with europe but does have a free trade deal you 're wrong . 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
  you 're being misinformed by tabloid propaganda . 
  seriously , read the official document for yourself . 
  have a nice day . 
   eu has free trade with countries like egypt and jordan already , why not the uk ? 
  in order for the uk to get free trade , there has to be freedom of movement . 
  the uk does n't want that . 
  that 's why they left the eu . 
  yet they 're asking for free trade as if they were entitled to it . 
  they are n't . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant ** tariff-free ** access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
   yeah sorry bud but you do n't really have no idea what you 're talking about and you do , right ? 
  you 're the expert ? 
  with no facts behind you ? 
  you invalidate all the facts i brought you without bringing any of your own . 
  that 's ignorance , my friend . 
  have a good day . 
   how many time do you have to be told that freedom of movement and visa free travel are not the same thing ? 
  repeating it wo n't make it true . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document .

   the concept of european freedom of movement is different to `` free movement of goods , persons and capital to various degrees '' .

   i just told you fom in context of the single market is a specific thing . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's negotiated .

  the uk rejects all forms of freedom of movement . 
  that 's why brexit happened . 
  you 're contradicting uk 's vote on brexit . 
  canada is not a member of the eu .
