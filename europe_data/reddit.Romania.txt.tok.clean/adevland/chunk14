  the point is that they 're blaming immigrants for things that have nothing to do with immigrants . 
  coal mines are being closed all over the world because coal is n't being used anymore . 
  people are shifting to cleaner , cheaper and more efficient alternatives . 
   and even re-qualify without outside help there has been tons of help . 
  but some people think they should get free money without actually having to do anything . 
  without actually learning new things . 
  these are the type of people that do not want new jobs . 
  they want their old jobs back . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  these are the people that think old dogs ca n't learn new tricks , which is false . 
  there 's been plenty of help . 
  [ for u.k. , a french lesson on closing coal mines ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-coal_3.html )  though close to 35,000 mining jobs have been eliminated in france since 1984 , outright firings have been rare . 
  the state-owned coal company , charbonnages de france , has turned instead to a multifaceted program designed to ease the pain for the miners and the country 's three big coal-mining regions . 
   the program , which has cost french taxpayers a walloping ** 10 billion francs ( $ 2 billion ) ** over the last six years , provides for early retirement , retraining , transfer of employees to other state enterprises , repatriation of foreign workers and aggressive efforts to aid business creation in the affected areas . 
  that 's a nyt article from 1992 . 
  the last coal mine in that region has closed down in 1990 , according to the video article we 're discussing . 
  some people just refuse to change and choose the easier option of blaming others for their misfortunes . 
   french coal , like british coal , costs far more to produce than it brings on the market . 
  in fact , despite big gains in productivity in recent years , french coal still costs nearly 50 percent more to mine than the imported coal arriving at its ports , transportation costs included . 
  that 's not because of immigrants . 
  they 're still there . 
  [ why ca n't we see stars in space photographs ? 
  ] ( http://www.iflscience.com/space/why-can-t-we-see-stars-in-space-photographs/ )  now , we could discuss how these people think that the world 's governments are running a trillion-dollar scam , and that they alone -- commenting on the internet -- have been able to spot the inaccuracies . 
  or we can admit that everybody is ignorant to varying degrees and that 's nothing to be ashamed of , as long as we are actively trying to fight it . 
   to take good pictures in space you need to have a high shutter speed and a very short exposure , which means our planet and satellite are clearly visible but the stars often ca n't be seen .

  poor people love lepen because they hate immigrants . 
  they hate immigrants because their mines closed because of cheaper competition . 
   but with increasing competition from cheaper labor cost countries , the mines closed one by one . 
   the list of culprits if familiar : europe , foreigners , globalization and the establishment . 
  below from a coffee shop owner in that town . 
  he wo n't be voting this year since he believes all politicians are corrupt . 
   the national front collects many votes from the poor . 
  when it comes to the difficult situation of employment , people are shocked by the aid given to immigrants . 
  they do n't accept it . 
   people always say `` there is not enough for us french , we will not help others . '' . 
  there 's been plenty of help .

  a sad story of how poor people cling to the nearest person that offers them the best promise for a better life while also blaming all of their misfortunes on others . 
  a sad story of how a coal town is looking to blame immigrants for the inability to adapt to an ever changing market . 
  [ us solar power employs more people than oil , coal and gas combined , report shows ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-solar-power-employs-more-people-more-oil-coal-gas-combined-donald-trump-green-energy-fossil-fuels-a7541971.html ) lepen is the same as trump , only with even less regard towards decency and common sense . 
  her only political promise is to blame and punish immigrants for all the problems of france while giving no solutions to the problems of french people . 
  coal is dead . 
  what is happening now with coal being replaced by clean energy , happened at the turn of the last century with manual labor that got replaced with mechanization . 
  people then blamed technology and companies . 
  people now blame other people . 
  they blame immigrants for the natural evolution of technology . 
  history repeats itself while most people have learned nothing . 
   from what i understand , the big obstacle to a uk/india trade deal are the specifics of visa relaxations . 
  that 's also one of the key reasons why the uk left the eu . 
  they want all of the benefits , but none of the responsibility . 
  that 's not how these things work . 
  i do n't know why , but i have a feeling romania and romanians will be blamed for this . 
   europe 's citizens first damn right !, 
   open markets are the best way of generating wealth and opportunities , of challenging vested interests and of expanding people 's freedom . 
  but ** they also tend to concentrate wealth geographically ** as opposed to a closed market where exactly the same thing happens ? 
  north korea has the best non-concentrated wealth !, 
  :d seriously , this is not true . 
  the eu has made it possible for companies to operate all over the place . 
  their hqs tend to be in their home countries while most money is handled in tax haven countries . 
  tax havens are not a symptom of an open market . 
  it boggles the mind that there are still people who believe these things are fake and filmed in some warehouse inside area 51 . 
  a short and concise answer to the age old question `` what has the eu done for me ? 
   of course the uk government takes a lot / most of the blame , ** but we were discussing just soros ** . 
  that 's a bad way to look at it because it creates the false impression that he 's the one to blame . 
  people are attacking even his non-profit organizations that are helping people get educated . 
  one unethical , but legal , action does n't invalidate another good and ethical action such as funding education . 
   his role in manipulating the pound is well known , and that 's probably what the guy was referring to ** he profited from an already existing problem he did n't create . 
  ** below from your linked article . 
   in the months leading up to black wednesday , soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling that would become immensely profitable if the pound fell below the lower band of the erm . 
  ** soros recognized the unfavourable position at which the united kingdom joined the erm ** , believing the rate at which the uk was brought into the exchange rate mechanism was too high , their inflation was also much too high ( triple the german rate ) , and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices . 
  george soros , the most high-profile of the currency market speculators , ** made over # 1 billion in profit by short selling sterling ** . 
  it 's like how christian bale 's character became rich in the movie the big short . 
  he knew there was a problem . 
  he profited from it . 
  others did the same . 
  soros just had the balls to put more money in it . 
  your argument against him is based on financial opportunity and the failure of the british government which you are totally ignoring . 
  ** the uk government fucked up and soros profited from it . 
  he did so legally . 
  ** how is he the villain here ? 
  he saw an opportunity and took it . 
  the flaw he profited from was already there and it would have hurt the uk market regardless . 
  do try to keep in mind that i 'm not trying to defend soros . 
  ** what he did is clearly unethical , although legal . 
  ** ** i 'm just trying to point out that the uk government is the one to blame for the problem existing in the first place . 
  it 's a paraphrase of the most popular pro-brexit arguments which are in obvious conflict with each other . 
   the eu `` has become centralizing , regulating and controlling , the opposite of what is needed for jobs and future success , '' said gerard lyons , a leave supporter and johnson 's chief economic adviser , in a [ column ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/business/gerard-lyons-we-will-prosper-from-brexit-a3223606.html ) for the london evening standard . 
   countries that succeed in the future global economy will `` need to be flexible , adaptable and ** control their own destiny ** . 
  brexit allows us this , '' he said .

  reject the scottish demands to ensure uk market domination . 
  ** control the scottish but reject eu control . 
  ** that 's a double standard . 
  that 's hypocrisy . 
  a few politicians who were educated by soros funded programs . 
  it 's funny how the uk does n't want the eu `` dictating '' them what to do , while being ok with and trying to preserve their monopoly on the financial services market . 
  `` you ca n't tell us what to do , and you ca n't tell us that we ca n't tell you what to do . '',
