  those rules are only for eu members . 
  they do not apply to ceta . 
  you 're literally debating semantics right now . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
   how many times do i have to say this before you will understand . 
  you do n't have to repeaat it , you have to prove it with facts . 
  and you failed to do so .

   perhaps you should have some self-awareness and realise that if 2 other posters are also telling you the same thing , you might be wrong .

   does that sound anything like what you think is in ceta ? 
  canada is not a member of the eu .

   if you 're wondering what my proof is that gulenists were behind the coop , i would encourage you to read on the history of the organization so your proof for current day events are past events ?

   freedom of movement is about permanent immigration ; not about temporary , short term visits . 
  this is false . 
  not all deals are the same . 
  read more about ceta . 
  it has freedom of movement .

  ** where 's the proof ? 
  ** am i supposed to take your word for it ? 
  am i supposed to trust erdogan ? 
   you are saying the uk can not have a trade deal without freedom of movement . 
  that 's what the eu said . 
  why are you ignoring this ? 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant ** tariff-free ** access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
  ...  i am showing that canada has a trade deal without freedom of movement . 
  this is false . 
  read about ceta . 
  all eu citizens can go to canada without a visa . 
  for tourism , business and even work .

   everything you have said is wrong why ? 
  because you say so ? 
  prove it !, 
  you brought no facts to support your claims .

  ...  will it be easier for eu citizens to work in canada ? 
   ceta will make it easier for company staff and other professionals to work on the other side of the atlantic , and for firms to move staff temporarily between the eu and canada . 
   this will help european companies run their operations in canada . 
   it will be also easier for other eu professionals to temporarily supply legal , accounting , architectural or similar services . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/ceta-explained/ ), 
   the single market is more than free trade . 
  among other things it is a customs union as well ... 
  i never said it was n't . 
  the point is that the uk does n't want freedom of movement and you ca n't have free trade with no freedom of movement . 
   okay , give me the article of ceta that i as a belgian can move to canada settle there and get a job without dealing with the immigration process other 3rd part immigrants have to deal with . 
  here you go .

  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/ceta-explained/ ) ceta involves limited freedom of movement because the free trade is also limited to 98 % tarrifs with lots of mutually agreed upon regulations on top . 
  ** free trade can not happen with zero freedom of movement . 
  i 'm glad we agree . 
   ceta does not involve freedom of movement as defined within the context of the eu single market . 
  because canada is not in the eu . 
  if the uk agrees to something like ceta , then there can be free trade . 
  there can not be free trade without freedom of movement . 
  the degree of freedom is directly proportionate between free trade and freedom of movement . 
  the uk wants free trade with zero freedom of movement . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  the eu made this very clear . 
  i really do n't know why you 're insisting otherwise . 
   i 'm pretty sure you 're just trolling now , but it 's really disconcerting to think you might not be . 
  so i 'm trolling because i 'm using facts and official eu statements to back up my arguments ? 
  you literally claimed only fake news from uk tabloids so far . 
  you brought no arguments or facts to back up the bs you claimed while i destroyed pretty much everything you said with quotes from the leaders you were talking about . 
  you literally have no idea about what you 're talking . 
   so , for the second time dear boy , we 're not trying to access the single market , be a member of it , anything . 
  you want free trade . 
  free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
   the eu would not grant ** tariff-free ** access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
  ca n't you read ? 
   let 's do this one more time , freest means a low barrier trade deal , that 's what the uk wants and that 's what the eu should want if it cares about its economies and people . 
  sorry , bro , but you are in no position to lecture me about what the eu `` should want '' because you left the eu . 
   freest does not mean free . 
  lowest does not mean zero . 
  low barrier free trade involves a directly proportionate freedom of movement . 
  that 's how ceta works between canada and the eu . 
  freedom of movement is mandatory .
