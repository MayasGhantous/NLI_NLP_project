  negotiations decide how much of it is required based on how much free trade you want . 
  ** no freedom of movement , no free trade . 
  ** it 's that simple . 
  the eu is very clear about this . 
  this discussion is over . 
   could you stop conflating free trade ( fta 's ) with the single market ? 
  dude , the single market market involves free trade and freedom of movement . 
  that 's how it works . 
  i did n't make up this stuff . 
    the eu would not be against an fta like we have with canada , korea , etc this is false . 
  the eu already said that free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said ** the eu would not grant tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu ** . 
  the free trade deal the eu has with canada ( ceta ) , actually involves freedom of movement . 
  if you want a trade deal with canada , go ahead and negotiate it . 
  canada is not the eu . 
   temporarily . 
  can you see how that is different to european freedom of movement ? 
  it does n't have to be the same . 
  the free trade between canada and the eu is n't even the same . 
  heck !, 
  it 's not the same even across eu members . 
  the general rules are the same , but the specifics vary from country to country . 
  you are now literally debating semantics . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for any argument . 
  the uk specifically wants free trade . 
  may said it in her own words . 
  the eu said it ca n't happen without freedom of movement . 
  the uk will either get a shitty trade deal , or no trade deal . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
   i should have known better than to reply to your post ... sorry . 
   have a good day !, 
   you run away when confronted with facts that dismantle your fake rhetoric just like last time . 
  cheers . 
   you can travel to canada for a business meeting without a visa . 
  you can travel as a tourist without a visa . 
  but you can not work there . 
  this is false . 
  you are misinformed . 
   will it be easier for eu citizens to work in canada ? 
   ceta will make it easier for company staff and other professionals to work on the other side of the atlantic , and for firms to move staff temporarily between the eu and canada . 
   this will help european companies run their operations in canada . 
   it will be also easier for other eu professionals to temporarily supply legal , accounting , architectural or similar services . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/ceta-explained/ ), 
   may 's explicitly saying if we ca n't have a free trade deal without fom , we 'll go for the freest trade deal we can get . 
  the eu already said that free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said ** the eu would not grant tariff-free access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu ** . 
  how many times do i have to tell you this ? 
   a tired old meme with no basis in reality . 
  that 's false . 
  you have been deceived . 
  the eu already said that free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  and the uk does n't want freedom of movement with the eu .

  you 're spreading lies . 
  you are literally fake news . 
   romanian citizens can travel to canada without visas , but you can not live there . 
  they can work there . 
  working there implies living there . 
  the same rules apply to canadians in the eu . 
   european freedom of movement is not the same as visa free travel . 
  the point is that the uk does n't want any form of freedom of movement with the eu . 
  and the eu clearly said free trade can not happen without freedom of travel . 
  if the uk would agree on freedom of travel like canada , then free trade would be possible . 
  but the uk does n't want freedom of movement . 
   and for firms to move staff temporarily ** between the eu and canada ** . 
  that 's reciprocity . 
  everything is mutual . 
  canada gets from the eu , what the eu gets from canada . 
  but this is not the point . 
  the uk does n't want any type of freedom of movement . 
  that 's the point . 
  not for tourism and not for business . 
  and the eu made it clear that free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
   you are aware that european freedom of movement is completely different to visa free travel ? 
  right ? 
  you are not aware of what ceta implies .

  all the things that canada gets from the eu , the eu gets from canada . 
  ** the key word here is reciprocity . 
  ** the uk wants free trade without freedom of movement . 
  the eu clearly said that can not happen . 
   and yet you can move permanently to other eu states . 
  the free trade with canada is n't the same as the free trade between eu members . 
  most tarrifs are gone , but not all . 
  there are also strict regulations that were negotiated between canada and the eu . 
  canada gets from the eu what canada gives to the eu . 
  ** the key word here is reciprocity . 
  ** you are being intentionally obtuse for ignoring these facts . 
   no , it does n't . 
  canada just got a fta without freedom of movement . 
  this is false . 
  canada got [ ceta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comprehensive_economic_and_trade_agreement ) which involves freedom of movement with all eu member states . 
   all other eu countries already had visa free travel to canada . 
  visas requirements were lifted for the czech republic on november 14 , 2013 . 
  canada has given a written undertaking to cancel visa requirements for bulgarian and romanian nationals visiting canada for business and tourism , within a period no later than the end of 2017 . 
  i 'm from romania . 
  starting with december 2017 i will be able to go to canada for tourism and business with just my personal id card . 
  no visa whatsoever .
