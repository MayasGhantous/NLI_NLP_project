  ** where 's the proof ? 
  ** do you trust erdogan ? 
  really ? 
  one could argue that he staged the whole thing to get more presidential powers . 
  there 's equal proof for both scenarios . 
  meaning none . 
   this misleading statement is thrown about so much . 
  oh , really ? 
  [ britain gambles on free trade deal with europe ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  may says she wants the '' ** freest possible trade ** in goods and services '' between the two , but eu leaders have made it clear that brexit britain ca n't have the same access to markets it enjoyed as an eu member . 
  those are may 's own words . 
  the uk wants free trade but no freedom of movement . 
  you ca n't have one without the other . 
   clearly recent events like junker sharing a detailed and opinionated version of the dinner were poor form need i bring up farage ? 
  that guy is basically uks official jester . 
  or the british tabloids ? 
  seriously , you 're accusing the eu for things that did n't happen , while the uk has been undermining the eu for decades . 
  farage has literally held anti eu rallies in other eu countries and you 're feeling upset about the alleged leaked documents ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  you do realize that 's a double standard and hugely hypocritical , right ? 
   these are n't accusations , it 's just fact . 
  ** where 's the proof ? 
  ** you 're spouting lies and projecting yourself onto others . 
  that 's exactly what the uk is doing right now through may , farage and other officials . 
  it 's a ** royal ** shit show . 
   this comment just shows how misinformed you are about what the uk wants . 
  may wants `` the best possible trade deal '' = / = single market access . 
  false . 
  you are the one misinforming others .

  the eu clearly said ** there can be no free trade without freedom of movement ** . 
  and the uk does n't want fom . 
  that 's one of the reasons of why they left in the first place . 
  single market access involves both free trade and freedom of movement . 
  the [ single market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_market ) involves free trade , among other things . 
   a single market is a type of trade bloc in which most trade barriers have been removed ( for goods ) with some ** common policies ** on product regulation , and ** freedom of movement ** of the factors of production ( capital and labour ) and of enterprise and services . 
  the goal is that the movement of capital , labour , goods , and services between the members is as easy as within them . 
   the uk can certainly have a free trade agreement only if it also involves a freedom of movement agreement which the uk does n't want . 
   many countries have free trade agreements with the eu , or are in the process of getting one . 
  yes . 
  but it also comes with freedom of movement agreements . 
  the uk does n't want this . 
   the canada deal certainly does not involve fom equal to that of eu states . 
  i live in romania . 
  starting with december this year i will be able to freely travel to canada for tourism and business . 
   free trade and the single market are not the same thing .

  the uk wants free trade without any of the other common policies that go along with being part of the single market . 
  ** the uk wants only the free trade part of the single market , while ignoring the freedom of movement part . 
   female firefighters !, 
  sounds like the type of people a government would want to jail . 
  turkey has already jailed firefighters and even teachers and medical workers for alleged ties to the coup . 
  [ turkish gov ' t detains 1358 , jails 381 over alleged coup involvement in last 15 days ] ( http://stockholmcf.org/turkish-govt-detains-1358-jails-381-over-alleged-coup-involvement-in-last-15-days/ ), 
   the article is quite clear that she aims for a free trade deal , not membership . 
  the eu is quite clear that ** you ca n't have free trade with the eu without upholding eu membership responsibilities ** . 
  the uk wants all of the benefits of being an eu member , without being an eu member . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  the latest deal with canada involves free trade and free movement of people plus other reciprocal relations . 
  the uk wants free trade without free movement . 
  it 's not possible because it undermines all eu members that actually uphold these principles . 
  the uk is being a huge cunt by even trying to ask for these things . 
   i am already fed-up of this propangada , from both sides . 
  to be fair , it 's entirely the uks fault . 
  it wants free trade with all the benefits and no responsibility . 
  the eu told them it 's not possible . 
  then the uk started making false accusations about the eu who 's allegedly trying to manipulate the brexit negotiations by stoking irish nationalism and other bs , while the eu defended itself and refuted the accusations . 
  meanwhile uk firms lobby to block irish imports because they voted against brexit . 
  who 's stoking who ? 
  this entire shit storm is the uks fault . 
  it is .

  how many of them are in prison after the coup arrests started ? 
   in the eu in 2015 , there were 1077 total arrests for terrorism , 687 for jihadist terrorism .

   he said he has to because it would otherwise be impossible to compete . 
  he says he has to , but also says that everybody else should buy american . 
  if trump , as a millionaire , ca n't compete , how can anyone else ? 
  that 's hypocrisy , bro . 
   seriously , why do n't they just get deported then ? 
  the article says nothing about them being immigrants . 
   in addition , fewer german citizens are leaving the country to join the so-called islamic state ( is ) in syria or iraq and considering attacks closer to home instead . 
  according to authorities , this can be contributed to the fact that is is being militarily weakened and fighting for them is a less attractive option . 
  that 's an article from 2014 in the nyt about a $ 11.7 million loan for fn from a russian bank that was officially recognized . 
  this is about another loan of # 2.6 million lepen allegedly requested for herself . 
  # 2.6 million is n't exactly cheap , but yes , they 're doing it for the exposure , views and ad revenue . 
   and you lost it . 
  saying it does n't make it true , bro . 
   the same goes for everything else you said . 
  you brought no arguments for the claims you made . 
  i brought you not only arguments , but also evidence and expert opinions on the matter that contradict what you said . 
  you ca n't win an argument without facts . 
  and you have no facts to prove the things you just said . 
  cheers . 
  you deleted a post with 38 points while ignoring posts with over 2500 points that are visible in the top page of this sub . 
  this is clearly cherry picking on your part . 
   it 's an apology piece written by omar alnatour to downplay the threat of islamic violence . 
  no , dude , it 's a collection of facts . 
  did you read them ?
