  did you even read the source materials ? 
  are you dismissing it because a muslim wrote it ? 
  that 's xenophobia , dude . 
  read the articles . 
  here 's one example from the article . 
  [ less than 2 percent of terrorist attacks in the e.u. 
  are religiously motivated ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/less-than-2-percent-of-terrorist-attacks-in-the-e-u-are-religiously-motivated-cec7d8ebedf6 ) it links to various europol statistics and to this nyt article about a us university study carried out by a non muslim . 
  [ radical u.s. muslims little threat , study says ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/us/radical-muslim-americans-pose-little-threat-study-says.html )  yes , they are counting some bank robberies as acts of terrorism even though the goal of the robberies was not political , but rather financing all those [ bank robberies ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005 ) had political motivations . 
   on february 14 , 2003 , kathleen ann soliah , a former member of the symbionese liberation army ( sla ) serving time for her role in a 1975 ** car bombing plot ** , was sentenced for the 1975 murder of myrna opsahl . 
  soliah received six years added to the sentence she was already serving , after pleading guilty on november 7 , 2002 , for her role in the 1975 sla bank robbery that killed opsahl . 
  you 're dismissing this because besides having done a car bombing plot , this person also robbed a bank . 
  that 's cherry picking . 
  you 're ignoring facts . 
  one other instance of a bank robbery was carried out by [ clayton lee waagner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clayton_waagner ) who is a convicted bank robber and anti-abortion terrorist . 
  waagner became most infamous for a hoax in november 2001 , in which he sent envelopes containing a white powder to more than 500 abortion providers . 
  the envelopes also contained a note , which said , `` you have been exposed to anthrax . 
  we are going to kill all of you . 
  from the army of god , virginia dare chapter . '', 
  this is an official fbi report , ffs !, 
  ** you 're the one cherry picking . 
  **  if you read further using the same report however , you will find that 2,977 out of 3,178 deaths are attributable to islamic terrorism since 1980 ( ~ 94 % ) . 
  those 2977 deaths are from 9/11 in the us . 
  one singular event . 
  i 'm not downplaying the deaths of those people . 
  [ terrorism by muslims makes up one-third of 1 percent of all murders in the us ] ( http://www.vox.com/world/2017/1/27/14412420/terrorism-muslims-america-islam-trump )  by contrast , roughly ** 11,000 ** americans were killed in gun homicides in 2016 -- yet trump has never said anything about creating a registry of gun owners . 
  [ american deaths in terrorism vs. gun violence in one graph ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/03/us/terrorism-gun-violence/ ) ...  in the united states , the cdc estimates that about [ twenty-two people are killed by cows each year ] ( http://io9.gizmodo.com/cows-are-deadlier-than-you-ever-knew-1690950434 ) that means that in the last 16 years about 16 \\* 22 = ** 352 ** people died from cow attacks . 
  is trump going to ban cows ? 
   til quebec is in europe ... oh , wait . 
  read the articles i posted . 
  [ less than 2 percent of terrorist attacks in the e.u. 
  are religiously motivated ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/less-than-2-percent-of-terrorist-attacks-in-the-e-u-are-religiously-motivated-cec7d8ebedf6 ), 
  i 'm calling bs on this . 
  the one i gave you as an example is still up and it has no `` submission statement '' by the op . 
  he 's a private citizen . 
  he can endorse anyone he wants . 
   at certain level of income , it 's nonsense to work for money , if you get money for free and it 's a rational decision to avoid work . 
  then do n't bitch about the government that 's giving you money . 
  you ca n't stop these programs because there are people who genuinely need them . 
   then you do n't know anything about human nature or nature itself . 
  and you 're an expert ? 
  this discussion is over . 
   i blame the government becouse they should know how people are motivated the government ca n't force people to work . 
  that 's what dictatorships do . 
   education wo n't change this i disagree . 
  how about the quebec mosque attack ? 
  that 's something trump does n't dare to tweet about since the guy who committed it is a trump and lepen supporter and not an immigrant . 
  [ non-muslims commit more terror attacks in the us and europe ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-alnatour/muslims-are-not-terrorist_b_8718000.html ) you do n't hear about them because [ attacks by muslims are written about 4.5 times more as other attacks ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/news-media-under-report-terror-attacks-islamist-extremists-muslims-donald-trump-fake-sweden-a7627601.html ), 
   but they were n't always exaggerated like they are today that 's your opinion . 
  macron , i believe , is pro relaxing them a bit . 
   why would they seek for a job , it costs time , effort , it 's probably not satisfying at start , they 'd have to learn something new ... if they get benefits anyway . 
  then do n't blame the government , blame and educate the people that do this . 
  the village was forcefully emptied by the former communist regime in 1986 . 
  communism fell in romania in december 1989 . 
  we 're keeping them under a close eye so that things like this do n't go unnoticed . 
  the eu parliament has also denounced them when they tried to do a similar thing on january 31st . 
  about 600 000 people protested then . 
  apparently it 's called the [ br\u00e2ncovenesc style ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a2ncovenesc_style ) . 
   br\u00e2ncovenesc style is synthesis between the byzantine , ottoman , late renaissance , and baroque architecture .

   that 's the exact symptoms of over-regulated economy with too many working rights . 
  again , france has always had employee friendly regulations . 
  france has not always had economy troubles . 
  there is little to no correlation . 
  but yes , companies would really like it if there were less worker rights . 
  this has always been true . 
  especially in france . 
   you 're repeating tabloid propaganda . 
  fixing the economy is n't as simple as cutting worker rights . 
   people are not motivated to move on when something ends becouse they still get money and sometimes they ca n't move on becouse the overregulated market is n't flexible enough so trying new things costs to much time and effort . 
  france has spent millions in helping these people find new jobs . 
  some simply refuse to do so while invoking age and stubbornness . 
  ** the same thing happened at the turn of the last century when mechanization replaced manual labor in factories . 
  if the situation were n't so sad , this would actually be funny . 
   they 've reversed themselves , apparently 1000 people spontaneously protested last night when the news of the corruption pardon broke . 
  obama is hugely popular right now . 
  heck , by comparison to trump , even bush looks better . 
  lepen having nearly copy paste policies ( meaning no policy other than blaming immigrants for everything ) is the true `` kiss of death '' that 's happening right now . 
  so yeah ... 
  thanks , trump !, 
  :d thanks for uniting europe against fear & hate mongers !, 
   downvote me all you like , it does n't make what i say any less true . 
  western europe is committing slow suicide and its citizens are paying for it . 
  brilliant !, 
  bro , you 're out of the loop . 
   [ euro zone economy outperforms u.s. with robust start to year ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-economy-gdp-iduskbn17z0uk )  the preliminary euro zone figure is much higher than the 0.7 percent annualized growth recorded in the united states in the same quarter , the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2014 , according to u.s. estimates . 
  if anything , it 's the us that 's committing slow suicide under trump . 
  and that 's not `` brilliant '' . 
   seriously , cities like st-etienne sometimes looks like a ghost town . 
  below from wikipedia  later , it became a ** mining centre of the loire coal mining basin ** , and more recently has become known for its bicycle industry . 
   in the first half of the 19th century it was only a chief town of an arrondissement in the d\u00e9partement of the loire , with a population of 33,064 in 1832 . 
  ** the concentration of industry prompted these numbers to rise rapidly ** to 110,000 by about 1880 . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint-%c3%89tienne ) this is typical for all mining towns . 
  ** the coal energy industry is dead/dying . 
  no politician can change this . 
  ** mining towns can not support the same population as they did when coal mining was booming .
