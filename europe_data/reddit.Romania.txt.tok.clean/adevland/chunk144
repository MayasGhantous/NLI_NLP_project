  it 's the same story as with the american gold rush . 
  towns appeared , prospered , then disappeared after the gold was gone . 
  people in these towns need to either move to other towns , or learn a new trade . 
  learning a new trade does n't guarantee a job in the old mining town since new jobs can not support the same population from when coal mining was booming . 
  france has always had employee friendly regulations . 
  the economic problems are mostly due to technological shifts in the industry and people that are mostly unwilling to learn new things . 
  there are lots of coal towns , that ran out of business decades ago , which are still asking for coal jobs to return . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  you can stimulate the economy by stimulating investments in new jobs , not old ones . 
  that 's exactly macron 's policy . 
  lepen 's policy is to blame everything on immigrants . 
  she literally has no plan to fix the economy . 
  thanks . 
  that 's a vague statement , bro . 
  what mistakes are you referring to ? 
  also , can you predict the future ? 
   but obamacare was hugely unpopular , it 's one of the reasons he was elected , to replace it . 
  trump fucked up with trumpcare . 
  big time . 
  obamacare is now more popular than ever . 
  [ the rise of obamacare : why is the aca so popular ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39157793 ) lots of people that voted for trump did n't even know that obamacare and aca are the same thing . 
   as for the economy , wrong again , it was doing okay under obama , it is soaring under trump , markets are at all time highs . 
  it 's soaring because of what obama did . 
  trump 's economy policies have n't even passed congress . 
  trump did n't change anything yet . 
  [ u.s. economy in first 100 days of trump looks a lot like obama economy ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-economy-under-trump-looks-a-lot-like-obama-economy-2017-04-23 )  more to the point , trump has also only been president for two-thirds of the first quarter . 
  ** most of his economic policies are still being shaped or debated in congress . 
   yeah because the economy is doing poorly in the u.s under trump . 
  let 's not forget the more than monthly islamic terror attacks ... oh wait , that 's france  the economy was doing ok when obama left . 
  ** trump is taking credit for what obama did with the economy . 
  ** [ trump keeps taking credit for obama-era economic news ] ( http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-keeps-taking-credit-obama-era-economic-news ) trump gave tax cuts to the rich so they are getting richer . 
  meanwhile he 's killing aca and replacing it with the hugely unpopular trumpcare that will leave millions of americans without medical insurance . 
  [ house republicans are charging ahead with a dishonest , reckless health care plan ] ( https://www.vox.com/2017/5/3/15531702/ahca-republicans-lying ), 
  probably . 
  the area is deserted . 
  almost everyone hates the leader of a country during a crisis . 
  tl ; dr : france has learned from uss mistake . 
  the eu is stoking irish nationalism !,

   if you 're interested in the debate you could honestly just watch the 5 last minutes . 
  both candidated get 2 minutes to speak freely and it sums up the whole thing perfectly . 
  is there a video ? 
  the brexit negotiations are n't going well for uk so theresa may is demonizing the eu in an act of desperation . 
  if the brexit negotiations fail and no deal is struck , the election , that she called for , will not go so well . 
  ** her reputation and her party 's reputation are on the line . 
  ** they 're literally copy pasting what erdogan did before the turkey referendum . 
  it 's sleazy as fuck . 
   is n't that the point of brexit ? 
  the point was to gracefully leave . 
  now the uk is stoking people against the eu because they 're failing at the brexit negotiations table . 
  this all stinks of desperation on the uks side . 
   there is no point comparing ourselves with the usa . 
  usa = united states of america eu = european union so it makes no sense to compare state unions economically ? 
  sure , they 're different . 
  but that 's an extra reason to compare them to see who fares better based on those differences . 
  still no tax returns from trump , though . 
  and i 'm not even going to mention trumpcare . 
  how exactly is the eu influencing the election that theresa may asked for ? 
   in a speech outside downing street , the ** prime minister - who has been accused by labour of stoking a confrontation for appearance 's sake ** - said the european commission had hardened its position to coincide with the 8 june poll . 
  oh , wait ... it 's the other way around . 
  theresa may is just projecting . 
  low energy ... 
   look at the polls ni voted to remain after brexit . 
   yes i do remember the attacks i suspect you have very simplistic view of what it was about though . 
  yeah . 
  they 're `` happily married '' . 
  you are now contradicting yourself . 
  this discussion is over . 
   the eu are looking to cause instablitiy and mayhem to take our focus of brexit negotiations , by stoking irish nationalist flames . 
  ni first stated that they did not want brexit and that they wanted to remain in the eu as per their brexit vote . 
  the eu reassured them that this can still happen even if the uk leaves . 
  that is all . 
  you 're taking things out of context and manipulating them to attack the eu because the uk is losing the negotiations . 
  it 's obvious and sad . 
   i 'm blaming them for trying to highten tensions . 
  the eu offered ni reassurances . 
  the uk offered false accusations and cheap attacks in order to get free trade . 
  it 's not happening , so you 're getting desperate . 
  you 're not fooling anyone . 
  this discussion is over . 
   more like going up to a happy married wife the uk and ni ? 
  happily married ? 
  holy shit , you 're out of touch with reality . 
  remember all those violent attacks from pro and anti irish extremists ? 
  yeah ... that 's not being `` happily married '' . 
  you 're delusional . 
   that 's what we 're trying to stop the eu from doing !, 
  that 's not what the eu is doing . 
  the irish have always had a strong nationalist sentiment . 
  you 're now trying to blame it on the eu . 
  that 's the point you 're missing . 
   accusing others of what exactly ? 
  `` stoking irish nationalism '' this is really getting old . 
   we 've recognised the issue of the violence for example and came up , with the roi , the good friday agreement . 
  good . 
  now leave them to decide on their own and stop using them as a brexit negotiations bargaining chip . 
   you have a very one dimensional understanding of the relationship between the uk and ni . 
  are you trying to say that everything is peachy and that the violence in the past is nothing to worry about ?
