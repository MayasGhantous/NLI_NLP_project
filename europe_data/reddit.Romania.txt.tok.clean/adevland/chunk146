  that 's some 4d chess you 're playing there . 
  ** by that logic you can literally blame everything on soros . 
  clearly soros . 
   there are territories of the uk and france that are not part of the eu . 
  why ca n't the reverse be true ? 
  because they are not part of the uk . 
   [ the 14 british overseas territories ( bot ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_overseas_territories ) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the united kingdom . 
   you are also forgetting the northern irish , who want to stay in the uk , its never as black and white as , oh the irish always wanted to leave , its quite ignorant really [ brexit : northern ireland ` can leave the uk for europe ' ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/brexit-northern-ireland-can-leave-the-uk-for-europe-1-4405012 )  under the terms of the good friday agreement of 1998 , the british government is legally obliged to offer irish voters a reunification poll should there be clear evidence of public support for the plan . 
   in the referendum last june , ** 56 per cent of voters in northern ireland voted to remain within the eu ** . 
  the only way for ni to remain in the eu is to leave the uk since the uk is leaving the eu . 
  it 's the same story as gibraltar . 
  the uk accused spain of wanting to annex gibraltar . 
  [ spain wo n't allow gibraltar to exercise `` unfair competition '' after brexit ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/05/03/inenglish/1493797850_570887.html ) the uk is being a huge cunt in the brexit negotiations for screaming `` bloody murder '' because its territories voted to remain . 
   why does 56 % of n.i voting to remain mean they want independence from the uk ? 
  because the uk is leaving the eu and the only way for ni to remain in the eu is for them to be independent of the uk . 
  it 's the same story as with gibraltar who also voted to remain . 
  people are losing their shit over there as well for nothing . 
  [ spain wo n't allow gibraltar to exercise `` unfair competition '' after brexit ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/05/03/inenglish/1493797850_570887.html ) the uk is being a huge cunt in the brexit negotiations for screaming `` bloody murder '' because its territories voted to remain . 
   because it 's a nod to irish nationalists in n.i. 
  joining the eu would mean leaving the uk . 
  that 's the kind of bullshit that i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm sorry , but when even you are admitting to talking bullshit , there is really nothing left to debate . 
   the eu are giving a nod to irish nationalists that they 'd accept them even though there is little to no chance of n.i leaving the uk . 
  that 's just stoking the flames of irish nationalism . 
  no , dude . 
  that 's reassuring them that they are welcome should they decide to leave from an abusive relationship . 
  a `` nod '' is not `` stoking the flames of nationalism '' . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  even you admit it . 
  this discussion is over . 
   she just wants a free trade deal . 
  `` but eu leaders have made it clear that brexit britain ca n't have the same access to markets it enjoyed as an eu member ''  where does it say she want a free trade deal for nought ? 
  that 's why the uk left . 
  if the uk wanted to cooperate , it would have stayed in the eu . 
  you 're literally asking why brexit happened . 
   northern ireland does n't want independence . 
  56 per cent of voters in northern ireland voted to remain within the eu . 
   but the eu inciting them to leave is remarkably petty . 
  northern ireland voted to remain in the eu . 
  how exactly is the eu inciting them to leave ? 
   it was the eu who said they 'd accept n.i to join the eu as part of ireland ... as if that 's somehow on the cards . 
   breaking up another stable country is not okay with uk politicians . 
  how did you jump from `` it 's ok if you want to join the eu '' to `` you should leave the uk '' ? 
  they have always wanted independence . 
  after brexit they actually requested another referendum . 
  the eu reassured them that they are welcome if they want to leave . 
  how is that pushing them to leave ? 
  that 's a huge stretch of the imagination . 
  ireland always wanted independence . 
  they only recently started voicing their pro eu ideas . 
  the eu only reassured them that they are welcome . 
  the uk is falsely accusing the eu of something that the uk has done to the eu for years . 
   i also said northern ireland did n't want independence in the same comment ... but you completely ignored that . 
  [ brexit : northern ireland ` can leave the uk for europe ' ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/brexit-northern-ireland-can-leave-the-uk-for-europe-1-4405012 )  under the terms of the good friday agreement of 1998 , the british government is legally obliged to offer irish voters a reunification poll should there be clear evidence of public support for the plan . 
   in the referendum last june , ** 56 per cent of voters in northern ireland voted to remain within the eu ** . 
   because they should n't be getting involved . 
  it 's a matter for northern ireland and the uk . 
  how did the eu get involved ? 
  the eu did n't get involved . 
  that 's farage 's bullshit conspiracy theory . 
  he 'll be blaming soros next . 
   ireland ? 
  ireland is independent . 
  i thought we were talking about northern ireland ... you 're being intentionally pedantic . 
  i said the irish . 
  that includes all irish people . 
   it 's just the eu has been stoking irish nationalism . 
  that 's farage 's bs . 
  how exactly has the eu stoked irish nationalism ? 
   i 'm saying breaking up a country and breaking up a union is 2 very different things . 
  breaking up a union is ok as long as it 's ok with uk politicians . 
  breaking up a country is also ok as long as it 's ok with uk politicians . 
  breaking up the uk is not ok with uk politicians . 
  ** the irish always wanted independence . 
  how is this suddenly blamed on the eu ? 
  **  one can affect stability and lead to bloodshed . 
  the other is just economical . 
  so you 're admitting that the irish always wanted independence and the eu has nothing to do with your crazy conspiracy theories . 
  thanks . 
   this is a foreign power ( eu ) stoking nationalism in a country to harm another one . 
  the irish always wanted independence . 
  how is this suddenly the eus fault ? 
   the biggest strawman that continuously gets thrown in our faces . 
  no one expects this . 
  you 're either lying or out of touch with reality . 
  [ britain gambles on free trade deal with europe ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  may says she wants the `` freest possible trade in goods and services '' between the two , but eu leaders have made it clear that brexit britain ca n't have the same access to markets it enjoyed as an eu member . 
  ...  it 's okay to incite a country , but northern ireland is n't a self-governing country . 
  northern ireland always wanted independence . 
  how is this suddenly the eus fault ? 
  this is just more false and hypocritical bs from the uk . 
   if they are a self-governing state , then sure . 
  ireland has always asked for independence . 
  how is this suddenly the eus fault ? 
   also , as long as you do n't affect the stability of that country as well . 
  like one that has seen bloodshed in the past over this issue . 
  you 're basically saying that the uk can do whatever the fuck it wants , while others are not allowed to interfere because the irish always wanted independence . 
  thanks for proving my point that the eu has nothing to do with this . 
   the consultation 's online version was recently swept up in another scandal when news site 444 . hu discovered a suspicious line of code in the site 's infrastructure which forwarded the personal information of respondents to russian servers , and logged their keystrokes on the consultation 's webpage . 
  the owner of the code , russian it firm yandex , has been implicated in providing personal information to russia 's state security service , the fsb . 
  the code was quickly taken off the national consultation website after the story broke .
