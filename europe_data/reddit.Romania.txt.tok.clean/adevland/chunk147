  remember that this is an official hungary government site . 
   `` people like me '' ? 
  i 've mistaken you with someone else . 
  i 've edited my previous comment . 
   how is irish nationalism a part of the brexit negotiations ? 
  it is n't . 
  that 's farage 's bullshit . 
   we 're just trying to leave , so we can get on with business . 
  but the eu intend to make it as difficult as possible . 
  false . 
  the uk wants a trade deal with as many benefits as possible and zero obligations . 
  the eu is protecting the interests of its members . 
  the uk is essentially surprised that the eu is acting like an european union . 
   yes ... because freedom of speech is a thing . 
  and to say that an institution does n't work to others , is not illegal . 
  if it 's ok to incite countries to leave the eu , it 's ok to incite them to join the eu . 
  if it 's ok to incite countries to leave the eu , it 's ok to incite them to join the eu . 
   with navalny , he has courted nationalists all his political career - that may or may not have influenced sputnik & pogrom 's decision to endorse . 
  people always conveniently omit this detail until they 're confronted about their intentions . 
  this is not ok . 
  this is `` fake news '' propaganda . 
  you might as well drop soros in there . 
   we 're not trying to stoke catalonian seperatism for example . 
  because catalonians are not involved in brexit negotiations . 
  this is all about the brexit negotiations . 
  the uk is desperate to get a good deal and it 's throwing all shitty strategies towards the eu . 
  the uk is being a huge cunt . 
   the eu is not a country bound by history . 
  wait ... are you trying to say that it 's ok to incite countries to leave the eu because the eu is not a country ? 
  really ? 
   a survey by broadcaster svt shows that the number of eu migrants begging in sweden has doubled in one year , to 4,000 , primarily from bulgaria and romania . 
  holy shit !, 
  an article from 2015 !, 
  sweden is doomed !, 
  seriously , nobody here is against tighter border checks as long as human rights are not violated . 
  your problem is that you 're blaming immigrants for all of your problems . 
  and that shit ai n't gon na fly unless you throw it yourself because it 's your own shit . 
  nobody is encouraging the irish to secede . 
  they 've asked for this for ages . 
  how is this suddenly the eus fault ? 
  on the other hand , farage has literally held anti-eu rallies in eu countries . 
   no but it does mean the nazis think endorsing mickey mouse is beneficial to their cause so , in your logic , if a bad group endorses a good entity , that automatically taints the good entity , right ? 
  how can you be sure that the bad group did n't do this on purpose in order to taint the good entity ? 
  or , better yet , how can you be sure that the two are not related in any way and the whole thing is not just a coincidence ? 
  you ca n't . 
  why ? 
  because ** correlation does not imply causation ** . 
  in the case of navalny , even the correlation is an ice thin argument . 
  anyone with a bad reputation can `` endorse '' anyone without any correlation between the two . 
  ** if your logic were true , this could also be abused to taint the reputation of others . 
  and that 's exactly what you 're trying to do . 
   romania camps and beggars are just propaganda . 
  yeah , dude . 
  because all beggars in the uk are romanians and because all of them live in camps . 
  sure . 
  mhm . 
  / s [ street beggar makes # 500 a day despite having his own home , councillor reveals ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12178026/wolverhampton-street-beggar-makes-500-a-day-despite-having-his-own-home.html )  wolverhampton 's environment boss , labour councillor steve evans , said `` by and large '' beggars in the city are not homeless and just want money for alcohol . 
  there 's also no mention of them being romanian . 
  pretty much everything you said so far are myths sold to you by british tabloids . 
  [ 5 big fat myths about gypsies , travellers and roma ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/5-big-fat-myths-about-gypsies-travellers-and-roma-8609751.html )  myth no . 
  5 : we will be inundated with welfare-seeking roma immigrants from romania and bulgaria next year  the bbc recently conducted a survey in romania and found that just 1 per cent of respondents said they will be looking for work in the uk in 2013 or 2014 . 
  apparently you 're still waiting for that `` gypsy invasion '' to happen . 
  do n't hold your breath . 
  this is a fucking joke . 
  it does n't even have captcha . 
  anyone can program a bot to spam the `` referendum '' with random names and predefined answers . 
  and anyone , from any country , can fill it out more than once . 
   a group that believes it can win a parliamentary election and is dead serious about annexing parts of kazakhstan , ukraine , belarus - and the baltic countries - endorses navalny . 
  if nazis endorse mickey mouse , does that make mickey mouse a nazi ? 
   like why would they even allow romania and bulgaria into the visa program ? 
  they ca n't even take care of their citizen that are causing problems in other eu countries . 
  that 's xenophobic tabloid propaganda talking . 
  are romanians suddenly a terror group and i 'm the only one who did n't get the memo ? 
  your rhetoric is the problem here . 
   ~ ~ irish nationalism ~ ~ ** nationalist extremism ** has resulted in terrorism and deaths , so there is a difference . 
  a big difference . 
  what farage does now is nothing but projecting himself onto others . 
  what 's your point ? 
  are you trying to say that it 's ok to incite countries to leave the eu because the eu is not a country ? 
  really ? 
   do you think the flaw in the system just magically appeared ? 
  it was put there by politicians who blame soros . 
   would you say it 's possible that he bribed politicians to intentionally introduce a flaw in the system that he could abuse by stealing billions from your average taxpayer ? 
  so soros bribed the politicians to fuck up the system . 
  then these exact politicians started blaming soros while forgetting about those bribes that could get them in jail ? 
  really ? 
  where 's the proof ? 
  did anyone find any evidence that soros bribed an entire political class that then conspired against him , even though that would mean having themselves locked up for bribery ? 
  and , assuming that this happened , even though there 's no evidence , why the fuck are you only blaming soros ? 
  why not also blame the politicians that you claim got the bribes ? 
  seriously , these conspiracy theories are getting ridiculous . 
  ca n't you come up with something more believable ? 
   i mean croatia was basically one leg in and then the refugee crisis got really bad and put it on hold . 
  how are refugees to blame for poland 's policies regarding immigration ? 
  people here are trigger happy and blame everything on immigrants . 
  your country did n't make it to schengen yet ? 
  it 's the immigrants , clearly ... / s :|, 
   your post applies to mexicans in the usa but this is a whole nother beast occurring in europe . 
  really ? 
  how about what you just said about not `` importing '' workers `` unless they are highly educated '' ?
