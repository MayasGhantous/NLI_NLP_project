   `` today , nationalist extremism risks conquering the power in our country and this represents the most imminent danger to our liberty and the unity of our people , '' they said , alluding to far-right candidate le pen and the increasing popularity of her anti-immigrant national front party . 
  lepen is popular because an increasing number of people are giving in to the fear mongering rhetoric that she uses . 
  those people are the problem . 
  they have been deceived by their fear and hatred towards minorities . 
  ** lepen literally has no plan to improve the lives of the french people . 
  she only spouts fear and hate in order to get elected . 
  ** this is what nationalist extremism is all about . 
  and it 's a huge problem because it creates more problems . 
  ** and it 's popular because it 's easier to blame it all on a minority instead of trying to fix things . 
  ** history is literally repeating itself and some people can not see it or do not care . 
   i guess that depends on your morals . 
  some people find it reprehensible . 
  because it 's easier to blame one guy that profited from a flaw in the system , than actually blaming the system and asking for it to be improved . 
   why not fly out to greece and tell their huge young unemployed demographic that `` we 're all in this together '' seeing as you believe in the unified strength to such a degree ? 
  why are you bringing up greece ? 
  their government lied about loans they had taken in the past to get new ones . 
  people in greece know this and have more faith in the eu than the uk does and the uk does n't any of their issues . 
   i think this just shows your colours , you 're a hard line member of the eu fanaticism club . 
  so i 'm a fanatic because i do n't support the uk even though the uk does n't support me ? 
  oh , really ? 
   the eu can choose self harm by unnecessarily reducing trade , relations and security with britain if it really wants . 
  it 's going to be a sorry show watching junker and merkel play ego massaging games at the cost of real jobs and people 's welfare though . 
  no , dude . 
  this right here is the sorry show . 
  your attitude is the sad story . 
  it 's inyoureye but you refuse to acknowledge it . 
   i think phones seem pricier perhaps , but i 'm going to wait another year before i buy a new one . 
  thanks for the input . 
   i 've actually bought phones from amazon.co.uk in the past and , overall , they were cheaper than buying them locally . 
  things seem to have changed since brexit . 
  that 's why i 'm asking . 
  i 'll probably stop buying things after brexit is over since i 'll have to pay import taxes as for all other non eu countries ... :(, 
   well no because i 'm talking about how brexit has affected me , therefore , it 's not a generalization . 
  you said i was angry at the uk . 
  how can you make such an assumption ? 
  i 'm only voicing my opinion while asking for the opinion of others . 
  you also accused me of generalizing what uk people think . 
  your own polls reflect what i said . 
  how is that me generalizing ? 
  i 've actually asked for more opinions . 
  that 's what this thread is about . 
  why are you being so negative towards me ? 
   the government and banks said there would be a recession after the vote . 
  can you not concede that you were wrong on that point ? 
  your edited comment says they predicted a ** mild recession ** and not `` a total recession '' as [ you previously stated ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68s0zf/why_is_anyone_surprised_the_uk_and_eu_do_not/dh16i7n/ ) . 
  you are now contradicting yourself . 
   i do n't read religiously any of the mail , times , sun , telegraph or guardian . 
  so you admit to reading them . 
  it 's obvious that their propaganda has influenced you to the degree that you 're contradicting yourself . 
   i mean , just going from your comments , you 've just made a thread expressing a crass generalization about the entire uk population from a few reddit debates you 've had . 
  this is not the first brexit debate i 've joined . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  i also did n't make a `` crass generalization '' . 
  that 's also what the polls say . 
  [ the latest polls show most people think brexit was a mistake . 
  this could be a turning point ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-poll-times-yougov-mistake-theresa-may-labour-corbyn-election-turning-point-a7705301.html )  i mean we were discussing a recession for the uk economy ( which would wreck the lives of millions ) and when you think you 've proved me wrong you put a bloody smiley face . 
  how is that not expressing glee about a situation which you are trying to convince me is absolutely dire ? 
  you were contradicting yourself and still are . 
  i find that amusing . 
   that 's why i created a thread to specifically discuss how others perceive brexit . 
   why are you so angry at the uk ? 
  painting all of our population as in `` denial '' is a crass generalization and you should do better . 
  i 'm not angry . 
  i 'm expressing my opinion while asking for others . 
   brexit has n't affected my life whatsoever so far . 
  is n't that `` a crass generalization and you should do better '' ? 
   it has n't really . 
  just caused a few heated discussions . 
  how about consumer goods prices ? 
  [ apple increases app store prices by 25 % following brexit vote ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/17/apple-ios-mac-app-store-prices-rise-25-per-cent-following-brexit )  apple is raising prices on its uk app store by almost 25 % to reflect the sharp depreciation of the pound following june 's vote to leave the european union . 
  how did the local tabloids spin that one ? 
   this is a lie , i can forgive you because you 're not in the uk so probably did n't follow the press as much . 
  oh , yes ... the uk press . 
  [ a bastion of truth and unbiased information . 
  ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161104075621-brexit-tabloids-540x304.jpg ) i 'm fairly sure that i got the best case scenario for not being intoxicated with all that anti eu hatred . 
   i was pointing out the passive aggressive joy you seem to be expressing regarding the entire situation . 
  it 's as if you want the uk 's economy to tank ; just admit it . 
  it 's as if you want others to want it to fail . 
  this is exactly what your tabloids intoxicated you with for years . 
   they predicted a total recession , not a fall in the currency prices which boosts uk exports . 
  no , dude . 
  they did n't . 
  they predicted exactly what is happening right now . 
   you know , i find it absolutely disgusting that people like you seem to look on this situation with such glee . 
  why do you say that ? 
  i do not take pleasure in what 's happening in the uk . 
  if anything , i find it very educational . 
  a negative example of what can happen if others make the same mistakes . 
   that 's some really great victim blaming . 
  but this is just bullshit . 
  the uk is victimizing itself . 
  [ britain 's may says eu united in getting deal that ` works for them ' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-iduskbn17y0xm ) the eu is united to get the best deal for its members ? 
  what a shocker !, 
  it 's like they 're united or something !, 
  seriously , you 've been fooled by your politicians and you 'll be soon paying the price . 
  it 's actually already happening . 
  [ apple increases app store prices by 25 % following brexit vote ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/17/apple-ios-mac-app-store-prices-rise-25-per-cent-following-brexit )  apple is raising prices on its uk app store by almost 25 % to reflect the sharp depreciation of the pound following june 's vote to leave the european union . 
  ** you 're in denial . 
  ** your government is already in the bargaining stage of grief . 
   over 220,000 romanians live in the uk ; that you want to see the economy which their livelihood depends on destroyed makes it even more reprehensible .
