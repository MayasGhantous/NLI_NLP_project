  are you actually trying to use them as hostages or something ? 
  `` give us free trade or the immigrants will suffer . '', 
  is that it ? 
  that 's disgusting . 
   the perceived slur against jaroslaw kaczynski , head of the governing law and justice party ( pis ) , follows comments from macron last week that , if elected , he would urge the european union to impose sanctions on poland for violating democratic norms . 
  these two bit dictator wannabes are in for a spin . 
  the eu and democracy are in a huge popularity comeback . 
   as queues formed in front of two kiosks selling sandwiches and hot drinks , one man said : `` at least here they sell french crepes instead of kebabs . ''  friends , families and young children were among the crowd , which was made up mostly of young people -- some of whom were too young to vote . 
   `` we are france 's future and this is what we want , '' said one of the girls , from the wealthy area of versailles in the south west of the french capital . 
  what a sad picture ... 
   a huge economic shock would take the uk into recession . 
  that never happened so the british pound has gone up , not down , right ? 
   bro , look at the graphs . 
  it has plummeted right after brexit . 
  it 's still low compared to the pre brexit value . 
  some companies are already starting to move their assets away from the uk . 
  and those that are still investing are doing so because they wo n't be able to do it as easily after brexit is over . 
  consumer goods prices are already up in the uk . 
  this is just the gray bitter silence before the dark storm . 
   yeah , but obviously it 's also the eu 's problem . 
  no , dude . 
  it 's not . 
  the eu has no obligation to protect companies in the uk . 
  the eu has an obligation to protect eu members . 
  giving in to the demands of the uk to have the cake after leaving the party would mean doing the opposite of that . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  [ first eu response to article 50 takes tough line on transitional deal ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/first-eu-response-to-article-50-takes-tough-line-on-transitional-deal )  leaked european parliament resolution puts three-year limit on transition arrangement and says no to free trade agreement in next two years the uk wants all the benefits but none of the responsibility . 
  it will end up with no benefits whatsoever . 
   i meant that companies based in the uk will be looking to sell their goods to different countries first of all , they 're already doing this . 
  secondly , they ca n't afford to stop trade with the eu , even if it will cost them more . 
  after brexit is over , they 'll be paying more for trade with the eu but they will be paying . 
  if they do n't , the eu competition will run them out of business because they 're also doing trade outside of the eu plus trade within the eu . 
   one economic shock ( which we are still waiting for ) is not going to derail the 5th largest economy in the world . 
  you 're forgetting that the uk is still an eu member . 
  the uk still benefits from free trade with the eu . 
  so far nothing has changed . 
  it will soon . 
  and it will be for the worst for the uk . 
  regardless of what deal they manage to get with the eu , it will suck compared to what they have now . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
   this assumes that trade between the uk and eu stays absolutely static before and after brexit . 
  is this what you 're saying ? 
  no , dude . 
  this assumes that , after brexit , the uk will no longer be an eu member . 
  and , regardless of what trade deal they manage to get , it will suck when compared to what they had when they were an eu member . 
  the uk will pay more for trade . 
  this is not an `` if '' , it 's a `` how much more '' . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
   it does not logically follow that this is only a problem for the uk brexit is a problem only for the uk because trade will continue no matter what . 
   basic economics tells us that the trade will go elsewhere so that a higher margin can be found exactly !, 
  companies are already moving their assets away from the uk . 
  those that ca n't afford to do this are investing more now in the uk because they wo n't be able to do so as easily after brexit is done . 
  ** regardless of the outcome , trade with the eu will suck for the uk after they lose their eu member status . 
  ** this is only a matter of time . 
  and , as you said , companies will begin to look elsewhere ; away from the uk and within the eu . 
   i hope it 's all for show and he does n't risk real economic harm in europe as well as the uk , just to make his political point . 
  first of all , the uk has more to lose than the eu has because there is strength in numbers . 
  the uk ca n't stop trade , and by having no trade deal in place , the eu will profit off of the uk from all those extra tariffs . 
  either that , or companies will start to move away from the uk . 
  the eu wins in all scenarios . 
  secondly , there is no political game . 
  the only scenario in which the eu loses is that where it makes a special trade deal with the uk without having the uk in the eu . 
  that would undermine all eu member states . 
  this shit will never happen . 
  it 's not politics . 
  it 's common sense . 
  this has been clear from the start .

  it will end up with no benefits whatsoever . 
   no trade deal is bad for both sides , not just the uk . 
  it 's actually less of an issue with the eu because the uk will have to pay through their nose to do business with the eu . 
  the uk needs the eu more than the eu needs the uk . 
  the uk has no bargaining chip . 
  the uk ca n't stop trade from happening . 
  and by having no trade deal , the eu is actually making more money off of the uk from all those extra tariffs . 
  thanks , brexit . 
  can we have free trade ? 
  ok , fuck you !, 
   ** every vote for me ** and my local team in this election ** will be a vote to ** demonstrate that ** unity of purpose ** , to strengthen my negotiating position , and to help me secure the best possible deal , '' she wrote . 
  oh , man ... you ca n't make up this shit . 
  it 's like a burglar is talking about the sanctity of ownership . 
  the uk chose to leave . 
  the eu did n't force them . 
  negotiations are happening because the uk asked for them . 
  and they are not going well for the uk because the eu wo n't give them special treatment because they will no longer be a part of the eu . 
  ** the uk stopped being the eu 's problem the moment when article 50 was invoked . 
  ** all of uk 's problems are now their own . 
  people should actually read the article instead of judging it by who wrote it . 
  it 's a valid point , but lots of outlets do great work while having click-bait articles in order to survive financially . 
  edgy teens have temporarily switched from '' < swastika  hail hitler < swastika  '' graffiti to this , as instructed by the leader of their favorite fb page that works at the local foreigner owned deli . 
  true patriotism . 
   if it was only the uk 's problem , why on earth are the eu negotiating ? 
  because the uk started the negotiations when they invoked article 50 . 
  here 's another article on the same story that has the same tone and message . 
  when projecting takes on a whole other meaning . 
   the oecd 's fdi figures included shell 's takeover of bg group , which was announced in 2015 but not recorded in the data until the deal completed most of these deals were announced well before the brexit vote . 
  people here are also forgetting the fact that the uk is still in the eu . 
  brexit has begun , but it 's far from over . 
  you can argue that companies that can not afford to leave are strengthening their positions before the uk leaves because it 'll be significantly harder to do so afterwards . 
   i think it is weird that people are changing their mind now , when nothing actually changed so far .
