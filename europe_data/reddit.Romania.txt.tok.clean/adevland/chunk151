  although the uk is still in the eu and considering that brexit has begun officially , changes are already happening . 
  here 's a tracker of news articles regarding the impact of brexit on the uk economy . 
  [ brexit business impact tracker ] ( https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-companies/ ), 
  ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) i guess you can say ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) it went to ramming speed, 
   what do n't you get ? 
  different media has different audiences . 
  it 's not about the audience , it 's about the prediction . 
  the article does n't talk about the audience . 
  it talks about the poll prediction . 
  and the prediction is irrelevant if it turns out to be false . 
  the yougov poll predicted a remain . 
  that did n't happen . 
  the poll failed to correctly predict the brexit vote outcome . 
  using it to correlate opinions about brexit is wrong because it failed in it 's job of predicting the brexit vote . 
  you ca n't say that the pro brexit sentiment in the uk has grown , because the pre brexit poll you 're using for reference is false . 
  it failed . 
  all correlations made on this are false . 
  here 's another article on the same topic . 
  [ what 's done is done but u.k. is starting to regret brexit ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-27/u-k-regrets-brexit-for-first-time-since-referendum-poll-says )  the yougov plc survey for the times newspaper found 45 percent of respondents agreed that , ** with hindsight ** , the country was wrong to vote for brexit . 
  the pre brexit poll should n't be compared to the post brexit poll because people now have hindsight because of the brexit vote happening ( and invalidated the pre brexit poll ) and the brexit procedure being underway . 
   they were n't wronggggggg , they were a poll of yougovs audience . 
  the poll said people would vote `` remain '' on brexit , but the official vote ended with `` leave '' . 
  how is that not wrong ? 
   so you think the polls were done differently to one another ? 
  one of them was faulty or something ? 
  polls are n't always right . 
  this is a known fact . 
  if one poll was wrong , it does n't mean that all polls are wrong . 
  the french election polls were spot on , for example . 
   visiting turkey instead of greece seems very weird to me . 
  it 's likely because of their politics . 
  but you said `` politics aside '' while apparently failing to make that distinction . 
   if yougovs voters become more `` leave '' over time , that is an indication that the uk as a whole is leaning towards `` leave '' more . 
  if the brexit vote did n't already happen , this would be true . 
  but the brexit vote did happen . 
  and the polls were proven wrong . 
  using them for comparison is wrong because they were wrong . 
   yougovs results are either relevant , or irrelevant . 
  you 're the one arguing that they indicate brexit is less popular , so decide if you think they mean anything or not . 
  if one poll was wrong , it does n't mean that all polls are wrong . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  all politics aside , it 's a fairly pretty country . 
   i always wanted to visit , but it 's not going to happen with their current government and politics . 
  getting jailed for facebook posts is a real thing in turkey . 
   but from solely the isolated yougov users , brexit has become more popular as of 1 year ago !, 
  `` the isolated yougov users '' are irrelevant . 
  that 's not what the article is referring to . 
  you ca n't compare a failed prediction with another prediction about the validity of which you know nothing . 
  it 's like predicting that it will rain today , but it does n't . 
  ** you ca n't say that it 's been a rainy week ** , based on the first failed prediction and another `` it will rain '' prediction , ** without it actually raining ** . 
  the fact that the first prediction failed means that it 's completely irrelevant and should n't be taken into account . 
  by this logic , i can invent my own polls that have nothing to do with reality and then come up with whatever false conclusions i want . 
  ** you ca n't make trend predictions based on false data . 
  ** also , the poll from before brexit is not the same as the one from after brexit because brexit happening changes the question . 
  `` is brexit ok ? '', 
  from before the official vote is not the same as `` is brexit ok ? '', 
  from after the official vote . 
  these are 2 entirely different perspectives . 
  comparing them makes no sense . 
   are you stupid ? 
  why are you insulting me ? 
  costs of living are not always proportionate to wages . 
  this means that , while some countries have higher wages , the product/services price difference is n't the same as with the wages . 
  the metric does n't account for this and that 's why it 's called '' ** relative ** poverty '' , because it depends on a lot of factors . 
  it can be easily tipped one way or another by say ... something like the immigrant crisis . 
  suddenly having lots of people working for low wages can change that scale . 
  that does n't mean that most wages have gone down while a select few have gone up . 
  the article does n't mention immigrants which have a huge role in the widening of this gap . 
  germany has taken in the most immigrants out of all eu countries . 
  ** the article is valid , but people here are panicking without knowing all the facts . 
   that 's the only valid metric because of costs of living .

  ** the article is valid , but people here are panicking without knowing all the facts . 
  no , it 's not the same . 
   risk of poverty = percentage of germans who earn less than 60 % of median national income . 
  it 's not the same because not all countries have the same median national income . 
  the uk has [ 21 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_the_united_kingdom#poverty_in_the_uk_in_the_21st_century ) people living in relative poverty . 
  germany has 16 % . 
  the article is intentionally negative while ignoring the huge numbers of immigrants germany has acquired . 
  some of them actually work . 
  in times when `` alternative '' facts are mainstream , we need more people that state the obvious . 
   you sound butthurt that the uk did not want to be in the eu and is now doing better because we ~ ~ are leaving it ~ ~ ** have n't left yet ** . 
  you sound butthurt for having your fake argument destroyed with simple logic . 
   new polls , with equivalent ways of producing data , should be compared against like ways of producing data . 
  no , dude . 
  all polls should be and are compared to factual data . 
  polls are predictions . 
  you ca n't compare a present day prediction to a past prediction that was wrong and deduct trends from it . 
  what you 're saying is complete bullshit and you know it . 
   the brexit poll you 're talking about was wrong because it said brexit would n't win and it did . 
  now you 're saying that brexit is winning more because the new poll has less people supporting it based on that other poll that was wrong ? 
  really ? 
  you 're comparing present day predictions to past false data .
