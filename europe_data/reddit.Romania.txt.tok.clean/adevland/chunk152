  all conclusions based on this comparison are false because you 're working with factually false data . 
  you 're being intentionally dense because you 're trying to spread fake news . 
   it makes exact sense because the way of making the prediction is the same way as the current poll . 
  i am comparing like with like . 
  ** if you fire a gun and miss and then you fire again and do n't know if you missed or not , you ca n't say that you 're getting better at shooting . 
  **  and are continuing to invest . 
  like i said before , not all economic agents are doing this . 
  some of them are doing the exact opposite . 
  you 're intentionally ignoring this to create your own false narrative . 
   those investments were made knowing that brexit is going to happen . 
  but they were still made . 
  invest now while the uk is still in the eu because later it 's going to be way harder . 
  this makes sense for those that were planning to do it and can not afford to move their assets . 
   the most recent poll is statistically in line with all recent polling . 
  ** it is also in line with the referendum result . 
  ** there has been no statistical change . 
  the past poll you 're comparing it to is n't `` in line with the referendum result '' . 
  you 're intentionally ignoring this to spread fake news . 
   no , i am comparing polls against polls , i.e. 
  apples against apples . 
  the referendum day poll was wrong and was invalidated by the brexit vote . 
  you 're comparing a current day poll with false data . 
  you 're comparing a present prediction with a past prediction that was proven to be false . 
  this makes no sense . 
   this latest poll is not statistically significant this is true . 
  the change is too small to matter . 
  however , it 's too early to tell . 
  brexit has yet to happen . 
   uk continues to grow strongly and have low unemployment , and uk continue to generate inwards investment . 
  again , brexit has n't happened . 
  you 're ignoring the bad signs and focusing only on the `` business as usual '' stuff . 
  all of those investments are possible because brexit has n't happened and the uk still benefits from being an eu member . 
  you 're also trying to compare present day predictions with past ones that were disproved by the official brexit vote in order to create a false narrative . 
   pentesting methodics are not different from those what were created decades ago . 
  then why are you complaining about universities created in the 2000s ? 
  if these methods have n't changed in 20 years , then why are these universities shit ? 
  you 're contradicting yourself . 
  you 're also hugely underestimating pen-testing methods and your only argument is that you 're a `` specialist '' for a linux embedded device os . 
  embedded devices have a really bad reputation regarding security . 
   i work as a openwrt specialist lol am i supposed to believe you eve though you did n't bring any arguments ? 
   redditor for 1 month sorry , bro . 
  the `` trust me , i 'm an engineer '' only works in memes and jokes . 
  that 's irrelevant since brexit won . 
  that poll was invalidated by the brexit vote result . 
  you 're comparing apples and oranges . 
  if anything , this shows that polls are sometimes inaccurate . 
  if one poll was inaccurate , that does n't mean that all polls are . 
  they should always be taken with a grain of salt . 
  the french election polls were spot on . 
  it 's not only the polls , though . 
  the pound has suffered while the euro has risen . 
  companies have already begun moving at least some of their assets to other eu countries . 
  these are facts , not polls . 
  and they show uncertainty and distrust towards brexit . 
  the article talked about the polls and people here said it was misleading . 
  that 's not true . 
  people id n't read the whole article . 
  they did n't do the math . 
  that 's the point . 
  they were jumping to false conclusions about the poll numbers . 
  it 's not only the polls , though . 
  the pound has suffered while the euro has risen . 
  companies have already begun moving at least some of their assets to other eu countries . 
  the polls show uncertainty . 
  and that 's not good . 
  time will give a definite answer on this once brexit actually happens . 
   yes , today 's polling , when compared to the referendum day polling in which leave one , shows that if anything there has been a move towards leave . 
  how did you reach that conclussion ? 
  45 % said brexit was a bad idea while 12 % said they did n't know . 
  that leaves 100-12-45 = 43 % . 
  and 45  43 . 
  what you 're saying makes no sense . 
   overall , it does n't seem like ` breget ' is really a thing . 
  like you said before , the change is statistically unimportant . 
  it 's too early to tell just by looking at the polls because people openly admit they do n't know . 
  the signs are there , though . 
  the pound has suffered while the euro has risen . 
  companies have already begun moving at least some of their assets to other eu countries . 
  nobody wants to see the uk suffer . 
  but it 's silly for them to expect leaving the eu while keeping all of the benefits . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  it already is n't happening . 
  the article says 12 % had no opinion . 
  100-12-45 = 43 and 45  43 . 
  also , as / u/gaethan [ said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67sxta/majority_of_british_voters_believe_brexit_was/dgtbd72/ )  the 12 % undecided is essentially people who would n't vote if the referendum were to be repeated now . 
  with only 88 % of the eligible people voting , 45 % of the eligible voters constitute 51,136 % of the total vote , which is a majority . 
  so the article is fair . 
  debating semantics does n't change the math . 
    and even then other polls contradict this one . 
  care to link them ? 
  the only ones i found are from 2016 after the referendum . 
   compared to yougov 's own poll ** on the day of the referendum ** , if anything brexit has become more popular . 
  that was almost 1 year ago . 
  we 're talking about today . 
  the article says 12 % had no opinion . 
  100-12-45 = 43 and 45  43 .
