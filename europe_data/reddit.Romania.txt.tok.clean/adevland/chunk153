  good point . 
  it 's an honest editing mistake , though . 
  the math is solid and the idea is still the same . 
  more and more people are regretting brexit . 
  you should leave them your comment on the article . 
  maybe they 'll fix it . 
  to be fair , germany 's standard for `` poor '' is , in part , to blame because lots of people come and work for those wages intentionally . 
  germany 's `` poor '' standard is n't poor at all in other countries . 
   it comes just days after yougov found 44 per cent of people opposed leaving the eu , while the same percentage supported brexit . 
  the change points to falling support for the move , which was officially launched with the triggering of article 50 last month . 
   the percentage of people who do not know has remained steady at ** 12 per cent ** since 10 january . 
  45 % is a majority because 100-12-45 = 43 and 45  43 . 
  seriously , read the whole article .

   for webdev it is , yeah . 
  in other spheres - meh , not so much . 
  it 's true for all software development . 
  and especially true about exploits . 
  if they 're publicly taught in schools , that means they 've been discovered and patched a long time ago . 
  hackers do n't learn about exploits in schools . 
  they do penetration testing and find new ones . 
  you clearly have no idea how these things work . 
   and even now they 're shit ( my gf studies in one ) maybe she 's just not good at it . 
  also , most `` hackers '' do n't study hacking in school . 
  it 's mostly a self taught thing because by the time schools teach it , it 's out of date . 
   what 's way more cost effective is to use galvanised steel where you coat it with a thin layer of zinc . 
  that comes off fairly easy even in normal usage conditions . 
  in a harsh desert , things would rapidly get out of control and the zinc would peal off within days from sand and salt exposure . 
  it all depends on the quality of the stainless steel . 
  i 've had stainless steel instruments for years and none of them have rusted . 
  i also had this one shitty pocket knife that rusted a few months after i got it , even though it claimed to be `` stainless '' . 
  there are various types of stainless steels . 
   just the body and suspension . 
  i guess you could upgrade those components with stainless variants . 
  just how my bike has an aluminum frame while the other `` perishable '' components are still made of steel . 
  this was a very educational discussion . 
  thanks for sharing . 
   the un only keeps the vehicle for a maximum of 5 years or 250 000 km which ever comes first . 
  does it really last that long in the desert ? 
  that was the point . 
  it makes sense otherwise . 
  how much more expensive would it be ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it would make a lot of sense in places like the desert where constantly replacing parts is not feasible technically and financially . 
  heck . 
  i 'd buy one just because it 's cool . 
   also , lots of bikes already use aluminum since it 's lighter and it does n't rust . 
  why , tho ' ? 
  noob question . 
  why are n't car components made of stainless steel ? 
  is n't it durable enough ? 
  or is it too expensive ? 
  people sometimes learn from the failures of others . 
  good changes do n't happen over night . 
  they are slow and often go unnoticed because of that . 
  fast changes are often bad , just because of emotions like hate and fear and not because of rational thought . 
   i was asking for sources which would indicate that communism and communist countries was ineffective or less effective at combating it . 
  nobody said that communism is better at fighting functional illiteracy . 
  the point here is that women from former communist countries are more inclined to pursue a career in technology than women from other countries . 
   all over the u.s.a. 30 million ( ** 14 % of adults ** ) are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/functional_illiteracy )  the basic literacy rate is approximately ** 99 % ** . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states ) it 's a pretty big problem world wide . 
  it breaks down to reading and understanding what you just read . 
  not understanding it means functional illiteracy . 
   it 's not like corruption is a communist exclusive . 
  i never said it was exclusive . 
  i just said it 's part of the communist legacy . 
  this does n't imply exclusivity . 
  this , along with universal education and universal healthcare , are some of the good legacies of communism . 
  there are plenty more bad ones like corruption . 
  functional illiteracy is a whole different matter , though . 
  1 word : ** communism ** . 
  the same thing happened in romania which also has a communist legacy that encouraged academic study above everything else with the end goal of creating an educated working class . 
   according to ms bezuglova , russian women 's foothold in science and technology can in part be traced back to the soviet era , when the advancement of science was made a national priority . 
  putin does n't even need bots . 
  he 's got trump supporters . 
   how ? 
  they 're not european countries ? 
  how are they affecting europeans ? 
  that 's a very good question . 
  you should ask trump . 
  us citizens have also been rigorously checked and detained at airports for hours since trump came to office . 
  things like asking for social media passwords are now the norm for everyone , regardless of nationality , even though they are a blatant violation of privacy . 
  below from the article  the trump administration last month introduced an electronics ban that affects nine airlines operating flights from the middle east and africa . 
   in march , trump announced a 90-day freeze on visas for citizens of syria , iran , libya , somalia , sudan and yemen . 
  courts have since blocked the restrictions . 
  these restrictions are what are prohibiting europeans to visit the us . 
  these restrictions are imposed by trump . 
  this is all about trump . 
  thanks , trump !, 
  this needs to be the top comment . 
   the qualitative study looked at presence and not the quantity of bacteria in the meat sample . 
   basic hygiene and cooking meat thoroughly reduces the risk of infection from meat . 
   someone driving a person should n't need a certificate nor permit , if he has a driving licence he can drive , if he has a vat-number he can run a ` business ' . 
  there you go .
