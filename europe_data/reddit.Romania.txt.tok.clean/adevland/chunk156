  because they are bad at managing their own economy . 
  after each bailout it got worse . 
  they requested each bailout . 
  they should have recovered long ago . 
  almost every other country already has . 
  greece and spain are pretty much the only countries in the eu that are doing poorly economically . 
  saying that that 's because of the eu is false because every other eu member has a steady and positive growth rate . 
  you 're generalizing intentionally in order to push your anti eu agenda . 
  those are monthly values that fluctuate heavily . 
  the us had 0.8 % growth in the summer of 2016 . 
  the [ annual values ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp-annual-growth-rate ) are more relevant . 
  united states 2.00 euro area 1.70 here 's the [ graph ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp-annual-growth-rate ) for the annual gdp growth rate for the eu . 
  the [ ** forecast for the us ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is less optimistic , showing ** a decline in growth ** . 
  the [ ** forecast for germany ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is more optimistic , showing ** a slow but steady increase in growth ** . 
  the [ ** forecast for italy ** ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is even more optimistic , showing ** a steady increase in growth ** . 
  the same optimistic trend is true for most eu countries . 
  even [ greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth-annual/forecast ) is expected to recover at some point . 
  they 're already doing better than previous years . 
   europe in general is experiencing terribly sluggish growth . 
  you 're one of those guys that complains about everything , are n't you ? 
  `` europe economy is growing but it 's not growing fast enough . '', 
  really ? 
   globally , the european union was outpaced four-fold ( ! ), 
  by the united states got some sources for that ? 
  outpaced in what ? 
  outpaced when ? 
  says who ? 
  you ? 
  you 'll have to do better that than . 
   unfortunately , other countries do n't fare so well , but what do the germans care about those territories ? 
  how about france , italy , the netherlands and others ? 
  pretty much only spain and greece are failing . 
  is the eu geared towards making everyone rich except for spain and greece ? 
  have you considered that spain and greece maybe are n't good at managing their own economy ? 
  but that ca n't be , right ? 
  it truly must be someone else 's fault . 
   three years ? 
  in most of the world the recovery 's been going on for a bit longer than that . 
  read the article i posted . 
   ** germany has been running a surplus for three years . 
  first of all , [ all countries contribute money as well as receiving money ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania_en ) . 
  some get more than others because that 's how the eu works . 
  the goal is to have all members on the same playing field . 
  all contributions are relative to each country 's gdp . 
  some countries make more money than others . 
  this has always been true . 
  the eu is one big party where everyone brings food and drinks . 
  and it would be highly unfair to expect champagne from the guy that came in on a bike just because the guy in the limo could afford it . 
  ** there are also other financial contributions and gains besides the direct ones . 
  ** people always omit this aspect and oversimplify a very complex issue . 
  ** free movement goes both ways . 
  ** ** cheap work force ** , including specialized workers , have long been a big `` import '' of the uk from eastern europe . 
  this actually includes uk companies that have offices in eastern europe and profit highly from the cheap labor while exporting goods and services all over europe . 
  most of that profit goes back to the company hq in the uk . 
  there are plenty other strategic and diplomatic aspects that are being ignored . 
  eu membership is a mutual benefit for all members . 
  the uk [ made more money from free trade and cheap labor ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-latest-cost-uk-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal-exports-negotiations-david-davis-a7325326.html ) than it [ directly contributed to the eu budget ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/how-much-do-we-spend-on-the-eu-and-what-else-could-it-pay-for/ ) . 
   in 2015 , that rebate reduced our contribution to ** # 12.9 billion ** . 
   total eu spending in the uk : ** [ $ 7.458 billion ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/unitedkingdom_en ) **  an analysis by the independent of official data suggests british exporters would face a cost of at least ** # 4.5 bn ** - and ** in all likelihood they would take a hit many times larger ** and that only covers direct contributions , direct eu spending in the uk and estimated trade deal profit losses . 
  the hit will be much larger since companies are already relocating assets to other parts of europe . 
  and this only covers the financial aspect of things . 
  people will have to get visas in order to travel . 
  businesses and tourism will take a huge hit from this alone . 
  ** those that say that the uk is giving more than it 's receiving from the eu have a very limited point of view . 
  [ 2008 -- 16 spanish financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%9316_spanish_financial_crisis )  the 2008 -- present spanish financial crisis , also known as the great recession in spain or the great spanish depression began in 2008 during the world [ financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%932008 ) . 
   the results of the crisis were devastating for spain , including a strong economic downturn , a severe increase in unemployment , and bankruptcies of major companies . 
  [ greek government-debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis )  the greek government-debt crisis ( also known as the greek depression ) is the sovereign debt crisis faced by greece in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 . 
   the greek crisis started in late 2009 , triggered by the turmoil of the [ great recession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession ) , structural weaknesses in the greek economy , and revelations that previous data on government debt levels and deficits had been undercounted by the greek government . 
  [ the latest polls show most people think brexit was a mistake . 
  this could be a turning point ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-poll-times-yougov-mistake-theresa-may-labour-corbyn-election-turning-point-a7705301.html ) denial , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance are the 5 stages of grief . 
  this is a discussion about how the uk views brexit and all that relates to it . 
  ** how has brexit affected your life and what do you think about it ? 
  1 - there are lots of people claiming that the uk does n't want free trade with the eu . 
  [ britain gambles on free trade deal with europe ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  may says she wants the '' ** freest possible trade ** in goods and services '' between the two , but eu leaders have made it clear that brexit britain ca n't have the same access to markets it enjoyed as an eu member . 
  2 - free trade can not happen without freedom of movement . 
  [ juncker tells uk : no single market without freedom of movement ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/juncker-tells-uk-no-single-market-without-freedom-of-movement/ )  he said the eu would not grant ** tariff-free ** access to the internal market for uk goods and services if britain did not accept free movement of workers from within the eu . 
  3 - after being confronted with these facts some people may claim that countries like canada already have free trade with the eu without having freedom of movement with the eu . 
  this is false . 
  ceta also involves freedom of movement . 
  here 's the official [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) document . 
  read chapter 10.1 about '' ** temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes ** '' below from chapter 10.3  each party shall allow temporary entry to natural persons for business purposes of the other party who otherwise complies with the party 's immigration measures applicable to temporary entry , in accordance with this chapter . 
  4 - at this point the debate may revolve around the definition of `` freedom of movement '' and pointing out that eu states allow for permanent residence and therefore what canada has is not free movement . 
  there is no singular form of freedom of movement within the eu . 
  it varies from one eu state to the next because the conditions depend on local immigration laws . 
  canda is also not an eu state . 
  ceta is a separately negotiated agreement . 
  ceta 's free trade is not the same as the one from within the eu . 
  the same goes for freedom of movement . 
  ** the point here is that free trade involves freedom of movement of the same degree . 
  ** thanks for reading . 
  someone is having fun on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_unionist_party ) ? 
   the democratic unionist party ( dup ) is the largest shower of cunts in westminister and the third-largest in northern ireland . 
  founded by ian paisley after fucking a badger paved into a gypsy tarmac , it is the largest incident of mass suicide in northern ireland 's history following the rape and murder of theresa may 's youngest son , actor and comedian pope francis . 
  a [ print-screen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pqwvpyl.png ) for future reference . 
  the last [ official report ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/april/tradoc_155506.pdf ) from the eu - japan free trade talks also addresses freedom of movement . 
   the last outstanding issues of the text on ** entry and temporary stay of natural persons ** were also discussed . 
  although there are still no details , this is looking more and more like ceta . 
  people from canada and the eu can enter and temporary stay in the other country/region as long as they have a job there . 
  lots of people wrongfully use ceta and the new eu - japan trade deal negotiations as examples for the idea that free trade can happen without freedom of movement . 
  it ca n't .
