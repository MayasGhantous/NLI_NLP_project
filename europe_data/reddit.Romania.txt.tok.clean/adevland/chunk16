  [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  britain should not be allowed to ` cherry-pick ' the benefits of eu membership while avoiding the costs . 
  the fact that the uk even suggested this is an insult towards the other eu members . 
   but the uk government does n't want to be in the single market read the article . 
  the uk tried and failed to negotiate free trade after leaving the eu . 
  [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ ) the uk wanted a clean break , with no responsibilities , but also free trade at the same time . 
  that 's cherry picking . 
  you ca n't have any benefits without committing to any responsibilities . 
   could n't tell you mate , i do n't work for mi5 . 
  fact is , you do n't know what they know . 
  and you do ? 
   maybe the threat was directly against planes to the us and uk , hardly a stretch . 
  again , you do n't know that . 
  that 's a big maybe . 
  you whole argument is based on suppositions . 
  that 's not an argument . 
  it 's just another `` maybe '' . 
   the thought that it 's all just some conspiracy to suck up to trump is baseless , pointless and laughable . 
  nope . 
  it 's probable and you ca n't deny the fact that the uk is either sucking up to trump or they know something they are not willing to share with others . 
  in both cases the uk looks like a big douche bag . 
   was canada cherry picking when they agreed to a trade deal with the the eu ? 
  canada was never a member of the eu . 
  there was never the problem of them leaving behind responsibilities because they were never a member of the eu . 
  canada 's trade deal with the eu is nothing like the trade deals eu members have with each other . 
  your argument makes no sense . 
  the uk has no actual leverage to use for eu trade deals so they go for blackmail . 
   [ it 'd take a special type of cunt to not warn another eu country on an attack if we had the intelligence . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62ccv2/brexit_dont_blackmail_us_over_security_eu_warns/dflh5wc/ ), 
   most other countries do n't have to worry about security like the us/uk eg . 
  romania . 
  how about france ? 
  they also had recent terrorist attacks . 
  why did n't they ban electronic devices from those 10 countries ? 
   and that everything will work out for the best fingers crossed , bro . 
   plus , i know if we get independence , the uk will fuck us over any chance they get because we left them . 
  that 's why you need the eu . 
  the uk is already doing that in one way or another . 
  it would be great if the independence would come in a package with close eu cooperation . 
  :d i 'm pretty sure that 's why scotland wants independence but is n't hurrying to get it . 
  they 're probably having sneaky talks with the eu right now . 
   i would give up cricket if we had allowed programmers from actual eu nations in . . and that 's the real reason why the uk left the eu . 
  talent , experience and skills have nothing to do with it . 
  you 're only interested in allowing `` programmers from actual eu nations '' . 
   the gypsies will continue to use our memorials as doss houses , they will continue to commit a disproportionate amount of crime to their population percentage here . 
  sure , bro . 
  blame it all on the gypsies . 
   that 's right , bro . 
  leaving the eu will prevent all future terrorist attacks because they were commited by gyp ... oh , wait !, 
  also , leaving the eu will stop immigrants from coming in , because it 's not like other eu countries already have strict immigration policies . 
  they do !, 
  so you really do n't have to leave the uk in order to stop immigrants . 
  that 's one big fat lie you got served by your own click-bait media . 
   in your own words  such a shame . 
   i am talking about the societal investment italy made in her education/training ... which is then lost to the uk . 
  i already addresses this above . 
   if you were referring to someone living in italy who then leaves to work in the uk , the same thing applies because people come and go to work across all of europe . 
   italy may lose your gf who goes to work in the uk , but so does the uk loses other people who come to work in italy . 
  you are ignoring facts that do not suit you . 
  this discussion is over . 
   i agree , but evidently britain felt we were n't getting enough so you left . 
  let 's see if you get more out of that . 
   being greedy is rarely beneficial . 
   and yet every nation has immigration controls exactly . 
  the uk already had strict immigration policies just like other countries in the eu . 
  everyone can come and visit , as a tourist , but if they want to work there , the process differs from one country to the next . 
  you did n't have to leave the eu to control immigration . 
    very difficult to measure aspects though ** that does n't mean that you have to completely ignore them . 
  ** that 's what you 're doing . 
  you 're only looking at the direct money the uk pays and receives from the eu . 
  that 's a very limited perspective . 
   trade figures you gave simply do n't add up for it be a net benefit so you 're relying on vague benefits how do they do n't add up if they are `` very difficult to measure '' to measure as you said earlier ? 
  you 're cherry picking . 
  you 're only looking at the arguments that suit your point of view . 
  ** you have a very limited point of view . 
  ** that 's the point of this entire discussion . 
   the worst thing about it so far is that people on the other side of the continent are trying to convince me deep down i know i 'm wrong . 
  companies are already starting to leave the uk . 
  and the british pound is on a downward trend since brexit . 
  like i said . 
  denial . 
   ** legally required ** to join when they meet the requirement no , it 's not `` legally required '' , but optional . 
  schengen members have a veto vote and have so far abused it . 
  but that 's another discussion entirely . 
   `` actually , tourism has risen '' brexit has n't happened yet . 
  there still is free movement . 
  people are still ordering stuff from amazon uk because there 's no import tax . 
  i 've done that myself several times and will do it again before the uk leaves for good . 
  after that , though , no more . 
   the damage is done :( yeah ... all those romanian programmers who contribute to the uk economy because you 're too busy playing cricket . 
  and all those jobs that you did n't want to do yourself ... 
  the damage has already been done . 
  you 'll have to wash your own dishes from now on . 
  i 'm intentionally exaggerating because that 's exactly what you do . 
   i have no idea why you brought exchange students into it . 
  dude , you brought it up . 
  :|  how does italy benefit by educating my girlfriend , paying for the infrastructure she uses for 21 years ( hospitals , roads etc ) , then losing her entire future tax contribution to the uk ? 
  [ those are your words . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/626y85/debunking_the_myth_that_the_uk_paid_more_than_it/dfk8dr7/ ) that 's how exchange programs work .
