  if you were referring to someone living in italy who then leaves to work in the uk , the same thing applies because people come and go to work across all of europe . 
  italy may lose your gf who goes to work in the uk , but so does the uk loses other people who come to work in italy . 
  ** you 're ignoring the fact that this goes both ways . 
   but there 's no way in which the us benefits from the uk doing this the uk is leaving the eu . 
  it will have to rely heavily on us trade . 
  this is but one in a future series of `` cooperation acts '' meant to strengthen trust . 
  there 's nothing inherently wrong with this , except  they were done for the same reason which is islamophobia . 
  no other countries have done this . 
  laptops and electronic equipment are already screened at airports across the world . 
  banning them is meant to discourage people from certain countries from travelling to the us and uk ** because the ban applies only to a few countries ** from the middle east . 
  that 's blatant discrimination and islamophobia . 
   as a brit , you should give having a fucking backbone a try . 
  that 's right !, 
  you may have made a huge mistake . 
  but , by god , it 's your huge mistake !, 
  sack up to it and ride it into the sunset no matter of the consequences . 
  that 's what any patriot would do !, 
  they are two different organizations . 
  nato has nothing to do with trade or free movement . 
   western values for all , or western values for none some western countries have social democracies that offer free healthcare and free education . 
  the us does n't . 
  not all `` western values '' are the same . 
   i might go as far to say they know a little more about what is best for flight routes to those countries than you or i. 
  of course you would . 
  trump knows best , so the uk is playing along because trump knows best . 
  all other countries are suckers for not playing along . 
  their security sucks compared to that of trump . 
  trump has the best security . 
  the uk is impressed and wants to play along . 
  just let that sink in . 
   you did n't try to address my claim that italy , romania , poland , whoever , lose out on tax take or vital public servants when we poach their people . 
  you 're ignoring the fact that italy is not the only country doing this . 
  while italy receives foreign students , it sends out its own . 
  that 's why it 's called a foreign student ** exchange ** program . 
  what a country pays for foreign students , other countries pay back for their students . 
  [ the erasmus program has been doing this for 30 years . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61tcfx/30_years_erasmus_program/ ) and it is a huge success for all participating parties . 
  again , you have a very limited point of view . 
   i just said they are n't certain to pay tax in those countries . 
  all businesses pay taxes . 
  this is irrelevant . 
  you were talking about profit , not taxes . 
  profit if what you get after paying taxes . 
  ** if those businesses were n't profitable , they would n't exist . 
  **  but i 'm not arrogant enough to claim to know the future . 
   one thing for certain is that your analysis does not stand up to scrutiny . 
  these things are already happening . 
  companies are already leaving the uk . 
  [ the uk pound is already in a slump compared to the euro . 
  ] ( http://www.x-rates.com/graph/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;amount=1 ), 
   the idea that the government is cherry picking in brexit is a complete and utter myth . 
  [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ ) `` at the same time '' that has since failed . 
  [ eu parliament vows uk wo n't get free trade deal in the next two years ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-parliament-uk-no-free-trade-deal-two-years-brexit-talks-philip-hammond-optimism-theresa-may-city-a7655686.html )  meps also insisted that if theresa may seeks a transition deal , to cushion the economic blow from brexit , it can only run for three years and must be `` limited in scope '' . 
   there will be no special deal for the city of london giving `` preferential access to the single market and , or , the customs union '' , the parliament will also stipulate . 
  the uk tried to cherry pick and failed . 
   if you think that increasing security is a an acknowledgement and a way to show political support then i 'm at a loss of words ... you poor soul . 
  we are not talking about security in general . 
  the uk is the only state to take that measure and it did so just after the us . 
  that 's a groupie mentality . 
   immigrants should not be an underclass we leave the menial and underpaid jobs for . 
  i agree . 
  but that 's how the free market works . 
  it 's actually a mutual benefit for both parties . 
   people do n't tend to like quick changes they 've neither asked for or approved of . 
  change is inevitable . 
  i understand how living on an island makes that difficult to comprehend . 
   so we contribute more than is given back to us . 
  dude , you 're cherry picking and taking things out of context . 
  read the whole post . 
  the eu is not just about giving and taking money . 
  there 's also free trade and free movement that generate tons of money . 
  that money will mostly go away after brexit because there will be no more free trade for the uk . 
  you have a very limited point of view . 
   add this to the eu spending in the uk and it is # 1bn short of the uk contribution . 
  read the whole post . 
  there are other aspects involved . 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic to prove to yourself that you did n't make the wrong choice . 
  you 're living in denial . 
   the schengen area has visa-free travel with every `` western '' nation not all eu members are in the schengen area . 
  the uk has lots of companies operating in those countries . 
   tourism has gone up since the vote following the ** devaluation of the pound ** . 
  thanks , brexit ? 
  what flavor of shit are you referring to , bro ? 
  be specific or gtfo . 
   ps , i fucking hate that i 'm getting dragged away from eu guys :'( scotland wants another referendum , no ? 
   you guys have more balls just because you admit you were wrong . 
  most brits are gladly sinking with their ship just so that they do n't look bad . 
  oh , the irony . 
  this is what years of anti eu hysteria produced . 
  enjoy your marmite . 
   if the eu wants the benefits of being a single government it does n't . 
  the eu is not a federation . 
   it seems likely that they used common information in coming to the conclusion that permitting laptops in carry-on was dangerous . 
  the uk is the only country to adopt the exact measure as the us , just after the us did it . 
  it 's like 2 guys running around in rain coats without it actually raining . 
   ... how would adopting similar security policy on direct flights from several countries make future trade deals any easier or more-beneficial ? 
  butt kissing . 
  the groupie mentality . 
  it 's ok , bro .
