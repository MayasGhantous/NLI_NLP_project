  you do n't have to worry about that anymore . 
   the analysis you linked to was not carried out by officials , but by a newspaper . 
  the article is based on official exports data from 2015 . 
  they explain how they reached that figure . 
   in 2015 official statistics show the uk exported # 133bn worth of goods to the rest of the european union , almost half of our global goods exports . 
  your whole point for trying to dismiss this is that the figure did n't come from a government official . 
  this does n't dismiss the fact that trade is a huge part of the uk economy . 
  ** you are trying to completely ignore import profits based on eu trade deals . 
  ** you ca n't deny that 's a lot of profit that you 're dismissing when you 're saying that `` the uk gave more than it took '' . 
   how does italy benefit by educating my girlfriend , paying for the infrastructure she uses for 21 years ( hospitals , roads etc ) , then losing her entire future tax contribution to the uk ? 
  italy is not the only country doing this . 
  ** denying foreign exchange students will set a precedent and incur sanctions from the eu . 
  ** ** exchange students offer no inherent profit or loss because italy is both sending and receiving exchange students . 
  ** that 's the whole point of programs like erasmus . 
  there 's a net cultural exchange gain from these because it tightens the relations between the participating countries . 
   neither you , nor anybody else , knows this for a fact . 
  ** why did those uk companies setup shop in eastern europe in the first place if it were n't profitable for them ? 
  **  again , who knows ? 
  if you really do n't know what will happen , then why did you vote to leave the eu ? 
  i 'll tell you why . 
  because you were misled by your politicians . 
  scotland already wants a second referendum and even people in the uk no longer want brexit . 
  read the whole post . 
  those are only the direct payments and money income the uk gets . 
  the uk profits way more from trade deals and free movement . 
  all of that , combined , makes for a very profitable uk eu membership . 
  you are cherry picking your arguments while ignoring the rest . 
  those are only the ** direct contributions and benefits ** the uk made . 
  the whole point of this discussion is to talk about all the other trade deals and ** indirect profit ** that will be lost . 
  and the fact that people , just like yourself , are completely ignoring them . 
  the eu is n't just about direct money contributions and direct money benefits . 
  trade deals , free movement of people and work force , tourism , investments are also heavily influenced by the eu membership . 
  you are oversimplifying a complex issue . 
   without wanting to be mean , the calcs you 've provided here are very crude as well , and rest upon a lot of assumptions . 
  they are estimates , not assumptions . 
  the difference is that they are made by people who are officially appointed to make them because there are never any exact figures . 
  trade , on an international level , relies heavilly on estimates and prognosis . 
  that 's how things work . 
   long story short , i 'm not sure that citing the mass import of ` cheap work force ' ( as you call them ) is the best way to advance this argument . 
  you are ignoring the uk companies that operate in eastern europe and pay lower wages than in the uk because that 's how the local economy works . 
  you 're saying it 's `` immoral '' but you are ignoring the fact that it 's ** a mutual benefit ** . 
  those jobs would not have existed if not for the uk companies . 
  after brexit , both the uk and those local economies in eastern europe will suffer . 
  there is no winner after brexit . 
  there will only be losers of various degrees . 
   except you 've not explained why the democrats voted for it . 
  are they sucking up to trump too ? 
  odd move , given that they 're in the party opposing him . 
  where does it say who voted on it ? 
  where does it say there was even a vote . 
   the new edict was distributed in an email described as `` ** confidential ** '' from the ** us transportation safety administration ** ( tsa ) on monday . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/20/us-forbids-devices-larger-cell-phones-flights-13-countries ) the notice came from the tsa which is under trump 's direct control . 
   britain is damaging it 's business sector appeasing someone by instituting a ban that already happened when the brexit vote results were made public . 
  also , you 're not showing how the ban would hurt the business sector ? 
  sure , it would hurt business with the eu and other countries , but that already happened under brexit . 
   unless there 's a suspected threat , using information from an organisation that a double assumption . 
  you 're assuming there 's a threat that only the us saw . 
  and you 're assuming the us handed that info only to the uk . 
  even if the us handed it to others , having only the uk act on it , exactly how the us did , is enough to arouse suspicion about its validity and true motive for the ban . 
   there is absolutely no reason the uk would ban these electronics for appeasement we both reached different conclusions . 
  some [ other guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/625raq/82_of_europeans_surveyed_in_9_countries_opposed/dfk2eqq/ ) actually agreed , and he was a brit . 
   the acquis is the body of common rights and obligations that is binding on all the eu member states . 
  i asked you to be specific . 
  that 's as generic as an answer can get . 
  statement : romania does n't play by the rules . 
  queation : what rules are you referring to , exactly ? 
  answer : all the rules !, 
  great argument , bro . 
  i guess i can agree to that . 
  here 's hoping all sides end up cooperating for mutual gain and profit . 
   frankly i 'm just impressed at how easily we can apparently extract massive concessions on trade with the us ... who said the butt kissing is over ? 
  by the looks of how well the eu trade deal is going , the butt kissing has only begun . 
   is it butt kissing to put a raincoat on if they are ? 
  it is butt kissing if you put a rain coat on if the other guy does the same thing while it 's not raining . 
  this is especially true if you 2 are the only ones walking around in rain coats without it actually raining . 
   but where does it say we expect a free trade deal for nout ? 
  [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ ) that 's `` a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal ** at the same time ** '' . 
  it obviously failed , as noted by the eu parliament . 
  [ eu parliament vows uk wo n't get free trade deal in the next two years ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-parliament-uk-no-free-trade-deal-two-years-brexit-talks-philip-hammond-optimism-theresa-may-city-a7655686.html )  meps also insisted that if theresa may seeks a transition deal , to cushion the economic blow from brexit , it can only run for three years and must be `` limited in scope '' . 
   there will be no special deal for the city of london giving `` preferential access to the single market and , or , the customs union '' , the parliament will also stipulate . 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic . 
  this discussion is over . 
  to this i agree . 
   its like comparing your country with a communist country like north korea because your goverment wanted to pass a law that would mitigate the fight against coruption . 
  north korea does n't fight corruption . 
  it embraces it . 
   the ban follows a similar move in the us , where officials say bombs could be hidden in a series of devices . 
   downing street said it was `` necessary , effective and proportionate '' . 
  adding 2 and 2 together makes for the uk butt kissing trump . 
  this is especially true if you consider that the uk , after leaving the eu , will have to rely more on us trade . 
   which suggests to me that it 's a response to actual intel we do n't know why they did it . 
  all we know is  the ban follows a similar move in the us , where officials say bombs could be hidden in a series of devices . 
  and that  downing street said it was `` necessary , effective and proportionate '' . 
  that 's it . 
  adding 2 and 2 together makes for the uk butt kissing trump . 
  this is especially true if you consider that the uk , after leaving the eu , will have to rely more on us trade . 
   ive been to romania in the 90 's  parts of africa were better developed than that absolute shithole of a country at the time . 
  you 're exaggerating .
