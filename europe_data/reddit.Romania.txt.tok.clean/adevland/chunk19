  also , that was 27 years ago right after communism fell . 
  did you ever have to deal with communism in your country ? 
  you 're being ignorant . 
   that does n't imply no free trade [ eu parliament vows uk wo n't get free trade deal in the next two years ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-parliament-uk-no-free-trade-deal-two-years-brexit-talks-philip-hammond-optimism-theresa-may-city-a7655686.html )  meps also insisted that if theresa may seeks a transition deal , to cushion the economic blow from brexit , it can only run for three years and must be `` limited in scope '' . 
   there will be no special deal for the city of london giving `` preferential access to the single market and , or , the customs union '' , the parliament will also stipulate . 
  ...  it 's hardly valuable to trump or the us in any considerable way ... trump is obsessed about security . 
  he takes extreme measures that do little to ensure security , since most us terror attacks were domestic , while making it hard for others to come and go to the us . 
  this has a huge impact on any future trade deals . 
  you can be sure that any future trade deals with the us will imply the same draconian and futile security measures . 
  the uk did n't even justify their decision to implement the ban . 
   the ban follows a similar move in the us , where officials say bombs could be hidden in a series of devices . 
   downing street said it was `` necessary , effective and proportionate '' . 
  it 's pretty obvious why they did it ... 
   so now you 're just making assumptions . 
  you mean like  so , a bunch of dave 's from the local pub ? 
  remember that ? 
  it 's not just a huge assumption , it could also be interpreted as an insult , but i 'm not going there . 
    you do n't actually have any legitimate evidence . 
  here 's your evidence , bro . 
   [ theresa may on the need for eu free trade deal : ` i agree ' ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/theresa-may-eu-free-trade-deal-i-agree/ )  leigh asked : `` ** is not our objective this ** : that we want to conclude , having adopted every last eu law into our laws on brexit day , ** a free trade agreement ** , which is overwhelmingly in the interest of the rest of europe ? 
  incidentally , this would mean so much for the poorest nations of the world , as we lead a battle in the world for a free trade and prosperous world . ''  may responded : `` i agree . '', 
   lads this anti-uk circle jerk is getting very cringe-worthy now . 
  the same can be said about the anti-eu circle jerk the uk has been doing in the past few years . 
   brexit should not be forgotten . 
  it needs to be remembered so that others do not make the same mistake . 
   may has been quite vocal in her desire for it , she 's even said ** she wants it to be the freest ** , tradiest , dealiest of them all , so that 's probably her attempt to get as close to the common market as she can , ** without freedom of movement ** . 
  that 's exactly what the original article said . 
    britain should not be allowed to ` cherry-pick ' the benefits of eu membership while avoiding the costs . 
  tl ; dr : gim me money , but keep filthy your immigrants . 
  that 's not how the eu works . 
   there will be a trade deal for the uk , but it will suck compared with what they had before . 
   `` we do n't seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave '' . 
  that 's the uk is being cocky . 
  they tried to get free trade for nothing and failed . 
  now they 're saying they did n't want it in the first place . 
  it 's all part of the negotiations . 
   the uk wants a good deal , of course it does , that deal will have some costs , and as long as they are reasonable , the uk will be happy to compromise . 
  the uk refused a `` soft brexit '' . 
  it opted for a `` hard brexit '' without any free trade . 
  the deal has yet to be negotiated . 
  the uk is pushing for a good deal , but it has little leverage . 
  the uk needs the eu more than the eu needs the uk . 
   acting on intelligence however is n't mimicking policies , it 's reacting in a similar way to a perceived threat . 
  they `` reacted '' in exactly the same way days after the us enacted the same policy . 
  i call it butt kissing . 
  you call it `` sharing intelligence '' . 
  it 's a matter of perspective . 
  the uk is the only other country to enact this after the us did . 
   you think a laptop ban on flights will mean future trade deals with the us would be easier and more beneficial ? 
  it 's butt kissing . 
  when in rome , do as the romans . 
   in 2015 , the uk 's full membership fee was ** # 17.8 billion ** . 
  however , ** britain does n't pay that full fee . 
  ** because of a deal negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , britain gets a `` rebate '' , an annual reduction in contributions . 
   in 2015 , that rebate reduced our contribution to ** # 12.9 billion ** . 
  shocker !, 
  [ how much money does britain currently pay the eu ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/how-much-do-we-spend-on-the-eu-and-what-else-could-it-pay-for/ ) here 's [ more info ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/625raq/82_of_europeans_surveyed_in_9_countries_opposed/dfk02m3/ ) . 
   eea membership , staying in the common market , is not free . 
  it involves responsibilities like norway has . 
  these include  the [ eea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area#eea_and_norway_grants ) and norway grants are the financial contributions of iceland , liechtenstein and norway to reduce social and economic disparities in europe . 
  the uk did n't want any of that responsibility so the free trade deal fell . 
  hence the `` hard brexit '' . 
   i have n't seen anyone suggest that the uk will simply get everything it 'd like and not have to compromise . . [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ )  to be fair , the uk and us have a closer intelligence sharing arrangement than anyone else sharing intelligence is one thing . 
  mimicking their policies is another . 
  one could argue that policy was mimicked just so that future trade deals with the us would be easier and more beneficial . 
  aka butt kissing . 
   who is the article quoting ? 
  a survey in 9 eu countries . 
  seriously . 
  read the article . 
   `` britain should retain a trade deal and all the benefits of the eu whilst not being a member '' . 
  find me this person . 
  [ britain has finally revealed its plan for brexit : it wants to negotiate a clean break with the european union and a new free trade deal at the same time . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/theresa-may-brexit-speech-trade/ ), 
   who are you quoting ? 
  the article . 
  which is about a poll in 9 eu countries . 
   so far , the governments of the other 27 eu member states have been strongly united around two basic positions : that there should be no ` pre-negotiations ' before the formal triggering of article 50 , and that ** britain should not be allowed to ` cherry-pick ' the benefits of eu membership while avoiding the costs ** . 
  ...  ** find me the person ** who suggested that the uk should retain all of the freedoms while not committing to any of the responsibilities ... or is your typical strawman ? 
  persons . 
  plural . 
  about 17\u00a0410\u00a0742 brits voted to leave from the eu responsibilities . 
  that also includes leaving all the benefits . 
  i wanted to say  goodbye , felicia . 
  but all the other jokes are just way better . 
  true eu team work . 
   it would seem somewhat obvious that the uk ca n't be in the single market without the four freedoms it 's not just about freedoms , it 's about responsibilities as well . 
  the uk wants all of the freedoms while not committing to any of the responsibilities . 
  that 's not how the eu works . 
   you do n't get free trade and free labor movement without committing to support the eu . 
   the uk does respect human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and have respect for human rights as long as it 's not immigrants . 
   seriously . 
  if the uk was n't a bloody island , they 'd probably build a wall just to make trump happy . 
  [ they already banned electronic devices on airplanes .

   the sum of the acquis . 
  [ all countries pay money as well as receiving money .
