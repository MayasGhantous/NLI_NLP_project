   )  and then became illegal after constitutional change . 
  bro , the constitution is more important than the law . 
  the laws have to obey the constitution , not the other way around . 
  you really have no idea what you 're talking about . 
   )  that 's why you 're ignoring large parts of my posts . 
  this is the third time you have accused me of this without providing examples . 
  making up accusations wo n't win you this argument . 
    you 're openly lying in the discussion and i 've just proven it . 
  you do n't deserve any attention anymore and you should not be treated seriously . 
  you 're pathetic at this point . 
  why are you generalizing ? 
  i said that  citizens did not execute the roundup . 
  citizens organized a resistance while the vichy government obbeyed nazi orders . 
  citizens did not execute nazi orders . 
  you said that citizens volunteered to help the police . 
  prove it !, 
   am i supposed to take your word for it ? 
  [ history says the contrary . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ) there was a shortage of volunteers . 
  and those that volunteered did so to officially join the government police . 
  there are no documented civilians helping police deport jews . 
  there are only civilians that joined the french police before the deportation and after it . 
  there are no recorded civilians volunteering just to deport jews . 
  ** you failed to provide proof for this . 
  ** as you did with the rest of your opinions . 
  opinions are n't facts . 
   that vichy government was legal . 
  so i wrote [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ) myself just to prove you wrong ? 
   after being ** appointed ** premier by president albert lebrun , marshal p\u00e9tain ordered the french government 's military representatives to sign an ** armistice ** with germany on [ 22 june 1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ) . 
  that 's some impressive mental gymnastics right there . 
  you are delusional . 
    you started it , dear . 
  i 'm adjusting to your retarted level od discussion . 
  why are you insulting me ? 
   it was an answer to your `` argument '' which started this level of discussion . 
  i brought arguments and historical facts . 
  you brought unproven opinions and insults . 
  you are failing at a civil discussion . 
   the state did . 
  this is a historic fact . 
  how did the state change ? 
  did the people change ? 
  did the land change ? 
  the only thing that changed was the surrender . 
  the government agreed to it . 
  it 's the government 's responsibility . 
   nope , you 're just ignoring some of them and repeating stuff you said and which i 've already answered to . 
  this is the fourth or fifth time you failed to point out what arguments i have ignored . 
  you ca n't point them out because you brought no arguments or facts , just false opinions . 
   i 'm not , you 've ended this discussion . 
  i did n't admit defeat . 
  that was your assumption . 
   you 're only answering after that becouse you 're an emotional , weak person that ca n't stand about being wrong . 
  again with the insults ... 
  i 've reported your comment . 
  please let me know if i missed any of your comments by pointing out the exact comments where that happened . 
  otherwise , i will no longer tolerate your ignorance , lack of arguments and insults aimed at myself . 
   there 's a general consensu among historians that vichy was a german puppet ( client ) state that 's not a fact . 
  that 's an interpretation . 
   the consensus does n't deny the facts , it tries to discredit the french government and their decisions because of national pride and international ridicule . 
  france is literally the only state that surrendered so easy . 
  no matter how you interpret elected french officials , they are the legitimate government from before and during the occupation . 
  a government does n't become illegitimate because people disagree with their actions . 
  sure , they made bad decisions . 
  that 's why france needs to acknowledge responsibility . 
  to make sure these things wo n't happen again . 
   it does n't matter when they started being nazis , what matter is that vichy state was n't a legal continuation of french sovereign state it matters . 
  because they were the elected official government . 
  if what you say is true , something happened that made them illegal . 
  and no such thing happened . 
  you claim it 's the surrender . 
  so it is illegal for a state to surrender when overwhelmed by a military force ? 
  your logic is failing . 
  you 're grasping for straws at this point . 
   i 'm not ignoring the jewish roundup , i even teached you a lesson about it ( you thought civilisans did n't took part in it ) i never said civilians did n't take part . 
  do not assume things on my behalf . 
  inventing false quotes wo n't win you any argument . 
   it 's you , who is urgnet about fabricating an alternate reality . 
  what alternate reality am i fabricating ? 
  so far i 've only quoted historic facts . 
  you quoted nothing . 
  all you have is your opinion . 
  you opinion is not a fact . 
   no , facts and history are against you . 
  saying it wo n't make it true . 
  you are getting desperate . 
  you literally brought no facts to support your opinion . 
   no , you call it whatever you like . 
  these are the facts . 
  why ? 
  because you say so ? 
  you 're behaving like a kindergarten kid . 
  i 'm not wrong . 
  you are ! '', 
  great rhetoric you got there , bro . 
  surely you are right because you say so . 
  yep . 
  / s  it was n't a legal french government becouse it was n't a legal continuation of a sovereign french state ** the government did not change when the nazis invaded france . 
  this is a historic fact . 
  ** ** france surrendered and accepted nazi rule .
