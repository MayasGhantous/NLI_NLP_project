  romania pays a lot via cheap labor . 
  other countries , like the uk , make huge profits from both romanian immigrants in the uk and also from uk companies in romania that transfer most of their profits back to the uk and eu . 
  ** you have a very limited point of view . 
   but romania doesnt pay for the ticket , others pay for them [ all countries pay money as well as receiving money . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania_en ) the free bus ride is only part of the eu membership . 
  romania pays for it with cheap labor . 
  other countries , like the uk , make huge profits from both immigrants in the uk and also from uk companies in romania that transfer most of their profits back to the uk and eu . 
  ** you have a very limited point of view . 
   what exactly has romania ever contributed to the eu ? 
  you get money and free movement for nothing . 
  first of all , this is false . 
  [ all countries contribute money as well as receiving money . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania_en ) some get more than others because that 's how the eu works . 
  the goal is to have all members on the same playing field . 
  all contributions are relative to each country 's gdp . 
  some countries make more money than others . 
  this has always been true . 
  the eu is one big party where everyone brings food and drinks . 
  and it would be highly unfair to expect champagne from the guy that came in on a bike just because the guy in the limo could afford it . 
  there are also other financial contributions besides the direct ones . 
  you 're omitting these on purpose . 
  ** free movement goes both ways . 
  ** the uk has actually been very restrictive to romanians and bulgarians , even though brits get free and unrestricted access . 
  ** cheap work force ** including specialized workers . 
  romania has some of the best computer programmers in the world , a field in which the uk has always sought to attract more immigrants . 
  this actually includes eu and uk companies that have offices in romania and profit highly from the cheap labor while exporting goods and services all over europe . 
  most of that profit goes back to the company hq in the uk or eu . 
  there are plenty other strategic and diplomatic aspects that you 're ignoring . 
  eu membership is a mutual benefit for all members . 
  the uk [ made more money from free trade and cheap labor ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-latest-cost-uk-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal-exports-negotiations-david-davis-a7325326.html ) than it [ directly contributed to the eu budget ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/how-much-do-we-spend-on-the-eu-and-what-else-could-it-pay-for/ ) . 
   in 2015 , that rebate reduced our contribution to ** # 12.9 billion ** . 
   total eu spending in the uk : ** $ 7.458 billion **  an analysis by the independent of official data suggests british exporters would face a cost of at least ** # 4.5 bn ** - and ** in all likelihood they would take a hit many times larger ** and that only covers direct contributions , direct eu spending in the uk and estimated trade deal profit losses . 
  the hit will be much larger since companies are already relocating assets to other parts of europe . 
  and this only covers the financial aspect of things . 
  people will have to get visas in order to travel . 
  businesses and tourism will take a huge hit from this alone . 
  ** you have a very limited point of view . 
   i 'm pretty sure the family bus is worth more than the car , tickets or not . 
  you pay the ticket to ride the bus . 
  you do n't own the bus . 
  the eu does . 
  everyone else gets bus rides for free . 
  they can also use the family car for groceries bought on discount . 
  the uk pays full price as well as transport fees . 
  enjoy your marmite . 
   you know , i think we are being fooled here . 
  it 's too late now . 
   honestly , when it comes to playing by the rules , that is just my country and maybe belgium . 
  definitely not romania , though . 
  what rules are you referring to , exactly ? 
   when i say the eu should bugger off , i really mean that it should be dissolved . 
  nice try , russia . 
   the deal should be done both sides thinking about that uk still be in european continent and about brexit percentages . 
  it was a `` majority wins '' vote , not a parliament vote . 
  the uk voted to leave so it 's leaving . 
  if it wants to stay , it has to play by the rules just like everyone else . 
  there 's no middle ground because that would be unfair to the other eu members who actually respect the rules and do not ask for preferential treatment . 
   britain should not be allowed to ` cherry-pick ' the benefits of eu membership while avoiding the costs . 
  damn right . 
  doing that would be an insult to all eu members who play by the rules . 
  the uk can run away from home , but it 's not taking the family car . 
  it 's taking the bus . 
  and it 's going to pay for the ticket . 
   the eu should bugger off is the same as  the uk should bugger off which is exactly what 's already happening . 
  you do n't get `` special '' trade deals when you `` bugger off '' . 
   it 's based on a misrepresentation from that document . 
  you 're saying this based on what ? 
   the gov document mentions only crop failure . 
  dude , read the article . 
   so far , bt cotton has been the only gm crop allowed in india bt cotton was the only failing crop . 
   you think an organisation like greenpeace would n't buy a few seeds to showcase that they 're indeed infertile ? 
  and how would they prove that the crop failed because of genetic manipulation and not because some other conditions . 
  proving this in court , without the gm research , is impossible . 
   there is no monpoly but you can buy pesticides and rent a tractor from monsanto . 
  how convenient !, 
   it 's led to almost all gm crops for a reason . 
  they are cheaper to produce for the farmer and there is n't high demand for organic foods . 
  tl ; dr : we do n't care about health or quality , we care about quantity . 
  now that the uk is out of the eu , why are you even so concerned about what the eu does ? 
   they just throw the seed down , and monsanto even sells them the pesticide which kills everything except the plant but , no ,  monsanto does not have a monopoly ...  monsanto does n't sue people willy nilly , they sue people trying to steal their seed . 
  how does monsanto own something that did n't even exist without the farmer 's actions ? 
  do they own the farmer 's kids if they eat monsanto patented corn ? 
   if a farmer owns his tractor he absolutely can repair it , it 's his . 
  it depends on the tractor . 
  [ a right to repair : why nebraska farmers are taking on john deere and apple ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/06/nebraska-farmers-right-to-repair-john-deere-apple ), 
   the sheer number of poles , romanians and bulgarians immigrating en masse did they invade your home ? 
  did they steal your job ? 
  did they cause you any harm in any way ? 
  that 's propaganda talking . 
  you 're a xenophobic tool of your own government . 
  this discussion is over . 
  dude , the article is about  steve marsh , an organic farmer in western australia , has lost his final bid in his landmark ** genetic modification contamination lawsuit ** against his neighboring farmer , michael baxter , who planted ** monsanto 's genetically modified ( gmo ) canola ** . 
  the guy lost his organic farming certification because of contamination from monsanto 's gm canola . 
  it 's a [ serious issue ] ( http://progressive.org/magazine/farmers-fight-save-organic-crops/ ) that 's the fault of patented gm crops . 
  monsanto sues every farmer that reuses their seeds , but they never take responsibility when they products contaminate other crops . 
  that 's a double standard . 
  they have a [ long history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monsanto_legal_cases ) of aggressive business practices . 
  they are responsible for creating agent orange which was used as a weapon in vietnam . 
  they have the money to influence all legal actions so that they end in their favor . 
  that 's why the us food industry is in shambles .
