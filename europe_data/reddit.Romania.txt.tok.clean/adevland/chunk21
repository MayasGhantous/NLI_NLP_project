  that 's why corn syrup intoxicates everything and why obesity is such a huge problem . 
  and that 's why all of this needs to be banned . 
  so that history does n't repeat itself in europe . 
   that article has nothing to do with patents . 
  below from the article . 
   farmers who have not purchased gmo seeds and find the crops growing on their land face potential litigation from the seed producers for ** patent infringement ** . 
   if monsanto can force farmers to pay royalty fees for their patented gmo seeds , they should be held liable when those patented genes end up in another farmers field , which causes them serious financial losses . 
   that 's a conspiracy theorists site the article is based on an [ official report ] ( http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/report-who-will-pay-for-failed-gm-crops-1780764 ) of the indian government . 
  ignoring it does n't invalidate the facts that onnly gm crops are failing in huge numbers when they should n't . 
  monsanto denies this because nobody can prove it 's true . 
  their crops are proprietary . 
  only they have the knowledge to prove it . 
  eu farmers , in their majority , do n't want to submit to the monopoly of corporations so that they can produce cheap and low quality produce . 
  and the eu vote reflects this . 
  their monopoly has wreak havoc on the food industry in the us . 
   laws should be put in place to regulate and mitigate damage caused by contamination , not outright banning of either gm or organic . 
  you already have this in the us . 
  and it 's lead to almost all gm crops . 
  people ca n't tell which is bio and which is n't because they 've only ever eaten gm crops . 
  laws are nice in theory . 
  in practice they 're abused by corporations via lobbying . 
  based on this idea , i support banning gms altogether because companies like monsanto have already shown to not behave in a fair manner . 
  it will lead to a monopoly , and the eu does n't take kindly to those . 
  banning gms will only prevent these problems . 
  if people really want to grow gms , then make it so that they ask it in writing and hold them responsible for how they grow them . 
  monsanto already sues and wins in cases of people that are planting seeds from the second generation . 
  their contract prohibits this . 
  these contracts should n't exist . 
  monsanto does n't should not own seeds that do not exist . 
  the same goes for the right to repair . 
  farmers are not allowed to repair the tractors they own . 
  these patents are getting out of hand . 
   you 're making a strawmen you shifted the discussion from gm crops to non gm crops and you 're accusing me of building a strawman ? . 
  please stay on topic . 
  patents on crops can and are already being abused . 
  [ organic farmer dealt final blow in landmark lawsuit over monsanto 's gmo contamination ] ( http://www.ecowatch.com/organic-farmer-dealt-final-blow-in-landmark-lawsuit-over-monsantos-gmo-1882173163.html )  steve marsh , an organic farmer in western australia , has lost his final bid in his landmark genetic modification contamination lawsuit against his neighboring farmer , michael baxter , who planted monsanto 's genetically modified ( gmo ) canola . 
   marsh claimed that he lost organic certification on approximately 70 percent of his property in kojonup , perth after winds carried his neighbor 's roundup ready canola seeds onto his farm in 2010 . 
   i said that some can . 
  same goes for gm . 
  and this is bad .

   patents on non gm crops exist . 
  there are gm crops and hybrids . 
  both involve research and can be patented . 
  there are also bio crops that have existed and been cross-bred by humans for thousands of years . 
  these can not be patented . 
  this means that not all non-gm crops can be patented . 
  the discussion was about gm crops and gm patents . 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic .

  you 're spamming . 
  read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61ur2o/eu_nations_vote_against_gm_crops/dfibtvf/ ) . 
   its just as easy to put a patent on a gm-seed as on a non-gm seed . 
  you ca n't patent nature . 
  for a patent to be given , you need to bring some change to it so that you can call it your idea . 
  there are thousands of breeds that are in the public domain . 
  they can not be patented . 
   how is it surprising monsanto would sue parent infringement ? 
  [ monsanto can sue farmers when gmo contamination goes over 1 % of their crop . 
  ] ( https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/04/gmo-patent-controversy-3-monsanto-sue-farmers-inadvertent-gmo-contamination/ ) if you choose to plant natural crops and your neighbor , who uses monsanto , contaminates your crop , you can be sued by monsanto . 
  this has already happened . 
  it needs to stop . 
  it 's all about quantity versus quality . 
  if you do n't care about quality and only want quantity , you go for gm crops . 
  europe has a tradition with natural produce . 
  my country as well . 
  i can spot gm produce just by looking at them . 
  everybody can because most people grew up having grandparents that grew their own . 
  and , yes , the taste is significantly inferior . 
  i 'd rather have natural crops with half of them dying to pests and weeds , than gm crops with high yield and poor quality . 
  there 's also the proprietary aspect . 
  some people do n't care about quality but want to remain independent of monsanto and friends . 
  it 's both a cultural and legal issue . 
   what 's the difference between buying sacks of seed from a farmer or from an agri-tech company ? 
  the company can sue you if you use the seeds from the next generation of plants because they hold a patent for the seeds , only they are allowed to sell them and you 're not allowed to use the seeds from the next generation of plants . 
  and even if your tried , it would n't work , because they 're genetically engineered that way . 
  [ monsanto sued small famers to protect seed patents , report says ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/12/monsanto-sues-farmers-seed-patents ), 
   non-gm is proprietary too , and can have the same restrictions enforced . 
  i can buy seeds from local farmers . 
  they sell them in sacks tied with string . 
  there 's nothing proprietary about them . 
   except it is n't . 
  comoetition among gm compagnies is the same as among non-gm corporations . 
  tell that to farmers that got sued by gm crop ip holders . 
  [ monsanto sued small famers to protect seed patents , report says ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/12/monsanto-sues-farmers-seed-patents ),
