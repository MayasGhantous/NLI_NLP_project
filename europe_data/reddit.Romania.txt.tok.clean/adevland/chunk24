  your logic is flawed and is akin to what trump said to the other nato members . 
  we have the us and russia as examples of how this worked out . 
  it 's not good . 
  democracy only works well in small countries . 
  when it 's a big country it 's easy for the federal representatives to fall pray to corruption and it 's hard for the people to do anything about it . 
  it 's also easier for corporations to get their way via legal bribes aka lobbying . 
  i 'm a fan of social democracy . 
  it 's worked really well in northern europe . 
   the eu is great but only as long as members are enticed to play along with each other . 
  that incentive goes away under a federation and countries can quickly become rich or poor states . 
  the eu , as it is now , helps to normalize the discrepancy and bring everyone on the same playing field . 
  that 's the problem with the uk , they want all the benefits but none of the duties of being an eu member . 
   the same is being done by the us . 
  no body bats an eye . 
  are you people too dense to realize how hypocritial it is to prevent russia from doing so and support another party doing the same ? 
  whataboutism at its best . 
  :d  [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) is a term describing a propaganda technique used by the soviet union in its dealings with the western world during the cold war . 
   a logical fallacy that attempts to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position , without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
  when was the last time a western country annexed foreign territory by military force ? 
   why did n't other powers express their concerns into the leadership that failed to live up to their promises ? 
  trump is being investigated by the fbi for collusion with russia . 
   you are drowning in the shit you created . 
  the general consensus is that the russian government created this shit and that now it 's returning home . 
   why is it justifiable for the anglo-saxon and american media to perform a coup 'd ` etat in russia federation so all those thousands of people who protested in all those cities across russia were paid by western powers ? 
  damn ... that 's a lot of money . 
  how about all the [ rampant corruption ] ( https://fbk.info/english/english/post/304/ ) ? 
  what if people protested out of their own will ? 
  i know . 
  it 's a crazy idea in russia . 
  you 'll get used to it . 
   strange how media oscilate between total pesimism and total optimism . 
  siding with whatever version they consider to be the winner in the short term in order to sell more ads . 
  [ oh , really ?

   if you 're going to judge the turkish people by erdogan , judge americans by trump . 
  i was n't judging . 
  i was asking a genuine question . 
  i never made any generalizations about turkish or american people . 
  their governments , on the other hand , are an entirely different thing . 
   they are far more aware of his hypocrisy and the threat be poses to the country than anyone in the west . 
  this is good to hear . 
  go and vote against his dictatorship at the referendum !, 
  bring friends and family . 
  make an event out of it . 
  educate the kids about their civic duty . 
  doing nothing is more dangerous because things will only get worse if you do nothing . 
  [ economic sanctions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_sanctions ), 
   the poll you linked was asking a different question to the one we were talking about . 
  it does n't measure whether people regret leaving . 
  [ brexit : if eu referendum was held again remain would win due to ` bregret ' , official figures reveal ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-held-again-second-remain-leave-vote-pound-crash-uk-economy-bregret-a7365561.html ) [ brexit research suggests 1.2 million leave voters regret their choice in reversal that could change result ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-news-second-eu-referendum-leave-voters-regret-bregret-choice-in-millions-a7113336.html ) [ the number of people who regret voting for brexit is now greater than the margin of victory for leave ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/brexit-vote-regret-leave-margin-victory-2016-10 ) this is how recent polls look like . 
  after brexit people had no clue what would happen next . 
  after the consequences started to appear , some began to change their minds . 
   your claim is actually a bit ridiculous , as there are already agreements meaning there will be no tariffs on civilian aircraft/parts for civilian aircraft and they wo n't stop after brexit . 
  all existing trade deals with the eu will be nullified and new ones wil have to be renegotiated . 
  there 's already a uk - us trade deal in the making . 
  [ brexit trade deal with us ` puts nhs , environment and food safety all at risk ' , theresa may warned ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-trade-deal-us-uk-donald-trump-theresa-may-threat-nhs-environment-food-safety-a7529836.html ), 
  pray ? 
   `` those limitations wo n't have any effect for other reasons '' who are you quoting ? 
  those rules are often broken . 
  [ poland wants eu to complain to wto over russian embargo ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/social-europe-jobs/news/poland-wants-eu-to-complain-to-wto-over-russian-embargo/ ) there are also de facto embargoes like very high prices for commodities . 
   you can sanction countries via embargoes ** and other limitations ** . 
   post-brexit focus groups : no regret from leavers things have changed a bit since august 2016 . 
  [ poll : uk public oppose exiting eu without deal ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/poll-uk-public-oppose-exiting-eu-without-deal/ )  why does a us company opening in the uk mean the us government needs to negotiate anything ? 
  trade rules and regulations are always negotiated by state representatives . 
  companies do n't make their own rules . 
  you 're being pedantic . 
  you get the idea but refuse to believe it . 
   they 're moving some of their operations to mainland eu . 
  for now . 
   `` in the beginning , the impact may be small but over time more services could migrate in that direction , '' eurasia 's rahman said . 
   i 'm not . 
  you seem to be the one that thinks that a bank moving some staff to the eu in order to do eu trading means the whole bank is leaving . 
  moving `` some of their assets '' to paris means more investments for france and less for the uk . 
  sure , the move is small , but it 's only the tip of the iceberg . 
  bank execs said this themselves . 
  even if they wanted to leave completely , they ca n't do it over night . 
   `` in the beginning , ** the impact may be small but over time more services could migrate in that direction ** , '' eurasia 's rahman said . 
  believe what you want . 
  you see it as `` some assets '' are going away . 
  analysts see it as `` it 's more profitable in france than in the uk '' . 
  that 's a wrong mentality to have . 
  you do n't have to wait for others to show you . 
  you must search yourself . 
   because , you know , it 's 100 % sure the vote wo n't be rigged by the erdogan 's fascist party . 
  tl ; dr : do n't vote because it 's gon na be rigged . 
  with that mentality erdogan will surely win . 
  gullible people always vote . 
  smart people sometimes choose to not bother . 
  that 's exactly what dictators like erdogan want . 
   in what court ? 
  your article mentions the icj , but that only has jurisdiction where both sides agree to submit to its decision . 
  the uk could just be a dick about it , but then they 'd get penalized severely via economic sanctions by the eu . 
  countries are not like people . 
  you can sanction countries via embargoes and other limitations . 
   you ask if the turkish people are blind as if they have a choice . 
  there 's always a choice . 
  you can go and vote against erdogan in the referendum . 
  if he loses it will be a great blow to his dictatorship . 
  but this wo n't happen if you have the `` we have no choice '' mentality . 
  go and vote !,
