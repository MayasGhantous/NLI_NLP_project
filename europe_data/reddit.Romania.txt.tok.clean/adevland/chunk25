   the comments by nunes ** do not appear to support trump 's claims ** , debunked by fbi director james comey , that he was wiretapped by his predecessor president barack obama . 
  rather , they appear to relate to conversations between trump or associates and people who were targeted by fisa warrants -- ** that nunes said did not appear to be illegal ** . 
  did you even read the article ? 
   the kremlin 's influence on the election and on the fact that a significant portion of the american public are delusional is totally marginal . 
  you 're saying this based on what ? 
  your gut feeling ? 
  there 's an fbi investigation underway and several key people from trump 's cabinet have already been implicated beyond any doubt . 
  denying or ignoring this wo n't make it go away . 
   `` the president looks forward to meeting with his nato counterparts to reaffirm our strong commitment to nato , and to discuss issues critical to the alliance , especially allied responsibility-sharing and nato 's role in the fight against terrorism , '' a white house statement said . 
  that 's from the article . 
   before he was elected , trump had called brussels a `` hellhole '' , unleashing a tsunami of ironic comments by residents of the eu 's capital in social media . 
  that 's also from the article . 
  you 're cherry picking and ignoring the rest . 
  that 's how t_d works . 
  that 's not how / r/europe works . 
   did you even read the article ? 
  or did you just look at the pretty picture ? 
  :d that 's , indeed , [ a great work of art ] ( http://assets.euractiv.com/lazy-load/img/crop/16x9/666.65625/http://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/trump-hellhole.jpg ) . 
  one of the greatest !, 
  it 's a direct quote from trump so you ca n't possibly disagree . 
  that would get you banned on t_d . 
  you should talk to your family and friends and go out and vote against erdogan in the referendum . 
  it 's about trump visiting brussels to discuss about nato . 
  brussels is the capital of the eu . 
   the uk is the worlds leading financial centre . 
  [ banks begin moving thousands of jobs out of britain ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/18/news/economy/brexit-banks-financial-services/ )  `` it 's terrible for financial services . 
  it 's going to lead to a lot of disruption in the financial community , '' warned mujtaba rahman , a managing director at risk consultancy eurasia group . 
   up to 1,000 of ubs 's ( ubs ) 5,000 employees in the u.k. will be moving to europe , the bank 's chairman , axel weber , told cnnmoney at the world economic forum in davos . 
   hsbc ( hsbc ) , which is ** britain 's largest bank ** , said it could also move roughly 1,000 jobs to paris . 
  bank ceo stuart gulliver said ** the staff affected generate roughly 20 % of its u.k.-based trading revenue ** . 
   '' ** in the beginning , the impact may be small but over time more services could migrate in that direction ** , '' eurasia 's rahman said . 
  you 're ignoring what 's already in front of you . 
  below from your article  britain must try to convince the eu that keeping open financial markets across the channel is a matter of mutual interest , with deutsche bank , for instance , getting nearly a fifth of its revenue in the uk . 
  these banks are already leaving or considering leaving . 
  this is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  that 's a legitimate reason . 
  this is / r/europe and not / r/london or any other local news subreddit . 
  you get permanently banned from t_d by just voicing your opinion in a civil comment . 
  there 's even a subreddit for people that got banned from t_d . 
  removing posts because they 're not relevant to the subreddit 's focus is not the same as getting permanently banned for voicing your opinion . 
  i 've seen and participated in lots of such discussions . 
   they 're merely creating satellite offices in preparation for the potential loss of passporting . 
  did n't you say  [ we 'd voted to leave so we 're going out the door . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60tngx/ukbased_airlines_told_to_move_to_europe_after/df9dkdj/ ) are you having second thoughts ? 
    over 90 % of business done in the city is uk and non-eu trade . 
  forgive me for not trusting you , but do you have any references for that or did you simply make up those numbers ? 
   when ? 
  companies are doing record levels of business . 
  world leading companies have opened up new uk headquarters . 
  it 's happening right now . 
  [ banks begin moving thousands of jobs out of britain ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/18/news/economy/brexit-banks-financial-services/ ), 
   surely given we 're leaving there would n't have been the investment if our eu membership was the big thing you think it is what investment are you talking about ? 
   but you just told us they were . 
  make your mind up . 
  the uk is leaving the eu . 
  they 're not leaving trade with the eu . 
  they 're just going to get less profitable deals because they left . 
  do n't worry , [ the eu is going to sue britain if it does n't pay its # 50 billion brexit divorce bill ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-sue-britain-50-billion-brexit-bill-2017-3 ) . 
   the eu is a sinking ship . 
  do you have any evidence for that statement ? 
   any new member is just another former soviet shithole economy who will take more than they put oh , ok . 
  i see . 
  your only argument is xenophobia . 
  thank you , / u/mr-oldfart , for you valuable insight on this matter . 
   yes . 
  i 'm glad that we agree on this . 
    it 's specifically focusing on the technology of the route ... nah , brah ... it 's also about the joint construction . 
  it 's does n't matter who does it first , technically . 
  it matters who does it first while being helped by another country . 
  forget japan who did it 6 years early !, 
  they did it on their own . 
  that 's too easy . 
  it does n't count . 
  :d  you know you 've won the argument when the only counter argument they can find is that you are white or male or old or when another country is involved in the project . 
   we import more from the eu than we export to the eu . 
  it 's not about you . 
  it 's about the other members . 
  do you really think the eu only imports and exports to the uk ? 
   and also housing the institutions that finance much of eu business and governments not for long . 
  [ banks begin moving thousands of jobs out of britain ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/18/news/economy/brexit-banks-financial-services/ ), 
   the top comment of the thread talks about it . 
  the top comment . 
  and he 's not even french . 
  and i replied that it 's not about practicality , but about tradition and public image . 
  the top comment itself is off topic and focuses on the route instead of focusing on the technology . 
   you make no sense . 
  you 're only argument for the channel tunnel being `` the first in human history '' is that it was a joint construction project between 2 countries , whereas a similar project had already been completed , 6 years earlier , in japan . 
  if the uk invaded france 100 years earlier , the tunnel channel would have not been a joint project between 2 countries . 
   why did you bring up le pen ? 
  you diverted from the current topic and pursued a futile discussion about how you were `` the first in human history '' to build an underwater tunnel . 
  that 's nationalistic pride . 
  [ you admitted it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60tge3/londonparis_electric_flight_in_decade_bbc_news/df99vhs/ )  i take pride in what is an unseen collaboration project between france and great britain extreme french nationalistic pride is the core philosophy behind lepen 's party and presidential campaign . 
   unseen quality counter argument right there . 
  dodging the question when the answer does n't suit you ? 
  :d seriously . 
  petty nationalistic pride has nothing to do with this discussion . 
  that 's a hallmark of a kindergarten child mentality .
