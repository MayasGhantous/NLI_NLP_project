   that 's about people thinking that remain would win read the whole article . 
   electoral services workers have reported calls from people asking if they could change their decision after friday 's result became clear , while some publicly admitted they intended to use a ** `` protest vote '' ** in the belief the uk was certain to remain in the european union . 
  ...  any suggestion that the public regret voting leave has been shown to be bs by opinion polls care to quote some of those polls ? 
  with links and references . 
   would n't the uk `` crumbling '' have an effect ? 
  it 's almost like the uk 's economy is still looking pretty healthy ... 
  it does have an effect . 
  that 's why they chose the uk and not an eu country . 
  if they had chosen an eu country , the us government would have had to negotiate with the eu . 
  it 's easier and cheaper to negotiate with just one country . 
  and since the us is already a close ally to the uk , brexit only made things easier for them . 
  seriously . 
  you 're focusing on only one example of a company which is n't based in the eu . 
  look at companies that are based in the eu . 
  lots of them are already voicing fears and plans of minimizing their presence in the uk . 
   what ? 
  i know . 
  it makes no sense . 
  [ anger over ` bregret ' as leave voters say they thought uk would stay in eu ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-anger-bregret-leave-voters-protest-vote-thought-uk-stay-in-eu-remain-win-a7102516.html ) the same thing happened in the us with trump . 
  voters wanted to send a message but did n't expect trump would win . 
  if they 're producing it in europe , presumably there 's a reason . 
  if it was meant purely for the us then surely they 'd just build them there . 
  being is investing in the uk because they 're unaffected by brexit . 
  boeing has nothing to lose from brexit . 
  ** on the contrary . 
  ** now that the uk leaves the eu , it will depend more on us trade than ever before . 
  boeing knows this . 
  it 's now cheaper for them to build the factory in the uk because the uk depends more on us money now that it will get less eu trade . 
   read again what i said , it 's the first to connect two countries . 
  and it is the first to connect 2 countries which is why the whole world knows about it . 
  ** the discussion was about an electric plane flight from paris to london . 
  ** why did you even think about the channel tunnel ? 
  only a petty french nationalist does that . 
   this is also why the american society of civil engineers named it one of the seven wonders of the modern world . 
  so if the uk invaded france 100 years earlier it would n't have been a wonder of the modern world , right ? 
   it 's already obvious you 're a ultra-supra-extreme nationalist and ceau\u0219escu nostalgic . 
  might be neo-nazi-bolchevik as well , have n't decided yet on this one though . 
  why are you bringing up ceausescu ? 
   tagged as romanian nationalist troll . 
  dude , you 're projecting . 
   seriously , how old are you ? 
   because i take pride in what is an unseen collaboration project between france and great britain you accuse me of being an extreme nationalist ? 
  you diverted the discussion about an electric airplane to an underwater tunnel built in 1994 and falsely claimed `` it was the first in human history '' . 
  that 's petty nationalism . 
   not to connect 2 different countries . 
  which is very , very different . 
  yeah ... 6 years later `` different '' . 
  so france was the first in human history to build an underwater tunnel together with another country ? 
  ca n't the brits say the same thing ? 
   what 's next ? 
  a 3 country construction project to build an underwater tunnel ? 
  will they claim to be `` the first in human history '' ? 
   we 've hugely diverted from the topic at hand . 
  this discussion is over . 
   which was announced after the referendum after the referendum nobody really expected the uk to actually leave the eu . 
  also , boeing is a us company . 
  the post brexit fears are about european countries leaving the uk because of losing free access to the rest of the eu . 
  being is unaffected by this since they 're based in the us and have no free trade to lose . 
  this actually makes sense for the uk . 
  without the eu , the us is the only place the uk can turn to . 
  that explains the recent [ uk flight ban on electronic devices ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39343971 ) which mimics the same ban that trump recently enacted . 
  this could be interpreted as butt kissing , but it 's really too early to tell . 
   an electric flight is still a plane flying , whether it uses dog shit or electric energy does n't make it a `` bridge between two nations '' that are so connected that thousands of people go spend just a day in each other 's capital city . 
  it 's a symbolic bridge . 
  it 's a tradition . 
  i already said it has little practicality . 
  why are you being so hostile ? 
   we were the first in human history to build a mother fucking undersea bridge to connect our two countries oh , ok . 
  i get it . 
  extreme french nationalism ? 
  you support lepen , amirite ? 
   and , no , you were n't `` the first in human history to build a mother fucking undersea bridge '' . 
  japan did it before [ in 1988 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seikan_tunnel ) . 
  the channel tunnel was opened [ in 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel ) . 
  ** that 's 6 years later . 
   thanks for agreeing with me . 
  you truly are `` theoneandonly '' who believes that . 
  cheers . 
   leaving aside that they 'd be entitled to royalties from their songs that they created being sung !, 
  exactly . 
  that 's akin to the less profitable trade deals the uk will get after leaving the eu . 
   i fully believe that the average politician more cares for ... 
  the average british politician has already shown what he/she believes in , and that 's not the best interest of the british people . 
  farage resigned after the brexit vote while saying that his `` political ambition '' was achieved . 
  [ nigel farage resigns as ukip leader after ` achieving political ambition ' of brexit ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader )  `` any restriction on free trade with britain would inevitably be at the cost of dutch exports , prosperity and employment , '' it said . 
  those are dutch politicians being selfish . 
  why do you thing that the `` multi-speed europe '' idea was proposed ? 
  because countries in the eu do n't always care about other members . 
  they just want free trade and do n't care about helping the others . 
  you ca n't have free trade unless you uphold your obligations as a member of a free trade group . 
  those obligations make free trade possible . 
  free trade would cease to exist if countries do not cooperate and help each other . 
   so they 're increasing their investment in the uk because they 're about to leave ? 
  who exactly have recently increased their investments ? 
   you should tell airbus that the uk is crumbling though - before they build their first european factory here . . airbus already has production sites in the uk . 
  did they recently announce any expansion plans ? 
   we , as turkey , call on europe to respect human rights and democracy this immediately after [ turkey arrests law student who made video against erdogan reform bid ] ( https://komnews.com/turkey-arrests-law-student-made-video-erdogan-reform-bid/ ) that 's how safe you are in turkey . 
  are turkish people really this blind ? 
  the uk knows that without the eu they 're essentially fucked . 
  and the eu wo n't give them preferential treatment .
