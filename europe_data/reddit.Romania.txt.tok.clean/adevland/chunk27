  so the uk is cosying up to donald trump indirectly so that they 're good on trade . 
  the lask of reasoning behind this decision only confirms islamophobia . 
   downing street said it was `` necessary , ** effective ** and proportionate '' . 
  how was this effective ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  only the us has done this before and it 's recent . 
   executives at major carriers have been reminded during ** recent private meetings ** with officials that to continue to operate on routes across the continent -- for instance , from milan to paris -- they must have a significant base on eu territory and that a majority of their capital shares must be eu-owned . 
  how are private meetings the eu being `` desperate for headlines '' ? 
  also , did you read the other headlines ?

   presumably that 's not because of a lack of investment then ? 
  why are investors pumping cash into the economy if it 's due to crumble even more ? 
  because they ca n't just pack up and leave over night . 
  there are big companies announcing they will reduce their presence in the uk . 
  this does n't mean they 'll leave but it does n't mean they wo n't because they ca n't just leave over night . 
  even if they wanted to leave , they still need to pump money into a gradual transition so that nobody will panic . 
   all i asked for was some kind of justification that `` the uk is crumbling '' . 
  my justification for saying that is all these recent articles about companies announcing that they will reduce their presence in the uk . 
  these are big companies . 
  these things have been happening for a while . 
  [ apple increases app store prices by 25 % following brexit vote ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/17/apple-ios-mac-app-store-prices-rise-25-per-cent-following-brexit ), 
   but there is no reason for either side to have any negative impact from trade - unless they want a political statement etc. 
  the uk wants to ditch their eu member responsibilities while keeping their rights . 
  this is not ok . other eu member states will not be ok with this . 
  it 's like saying you 're leaving the band because you 're sick and tired of playing , but you want to keep getting paid for the concerts . 
  that never happens . 
  eu - uk trade will continue , but the deals the uk will get will be substantially worse than before brexit . 
  this is all about minimizing their losses . 
  the uk wants to get the best deal they can while the eu wants to keep all eu member states happy . 
  the uk is playing hard to get in order to get a less sucky deal . 
  the deal will suck . 
  that 's inevitable . 
   the uk attracted more venture-capital investments last year than the next four european countries combined . 
  the uk was an eu member last year . 
   some companies will move a proportion of their staff elsewhere , but the economy is hardly coming to a standstill . 
  that 's the first wave . 
  also , even if they wanted to pack up and move everything , it would n't be feasible . 
  these things happen gradually . 
  even if they wanted to leave , they would n't admit it as to not create panic . 
  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  i honestly do n't want to see anyone suffer . 
  but having the uk demand special treatment and special trade deals is not ok . leaving the eu means losing all member responsibilities and rights . 
  you ca n't give up responsibility and expect to keep your rights . 
  and this has consequences . 
   it appears to be the other way around . 
  uk remaining calm and quiet while the eu is desperate for headlines the headlines are about brexit . 
  they 're about the uk . 
  you literally said that in a comment on a brexit related news article . 
  how is the eu desperate for headlines ? 
   how to argue like a petulant leftie : anything i dont like is russia russia russia is that your best argument ? 
  trump is being investigated by the fbi for ties with russia during and after the election . 
  you wo n't see this being discussed on t_d . 
  and yes , here you can discuss it . 
  on t_d you get banned for voicing your opinion unless it echoes trump 's opinion . 
  how to argue on t_d : maga maga maga and that 's a fact . 
  all threads are filled with [ deleted ] comment trees . 
  the hypocrisy is strong in you . 
   i 'm not disagreeing with you , but what 's crumbling ? 
  the local economy . 
  companies are already starting to look elsewhere for places to run their business . 
  this will quickly get more serious once brexit actually happens and that 's not far away . 
   so how has the country done it ? 
  by giving homeless people permanent housing as soon as they become homeless , rather than muddling along with various services that may eventually result in an offer of accommodation . 
  can confirm . 
  my approval rating in tropico 5 skyrocketed after i signed social housing decrees and built more houses with required wealth set to `` broke '' . 
  people are happy when they have healthcare , a home , food and security . 
  that game is fun and offers a tangible insight into real world politics and history . 
  the choice has more to do with tradition rather than practicality . 
  almost all flight development milestones were inaugurated to the public by flying that route . 
  it 's a symbolic route . 
  it 's a bridge between two nations that had long disputes across history . 
   does anyone really want a trade war ? 
  it 's more of a dare contest . 
  the uk ca n't hold this up . 
  they need the eu more than the eu needs them . 
  this is all a bluff . 
  the uk is trying to buy leverage and the only thing they have to trade is their stern poker face . 
  that wo n't hold for long as things are already starting to crumble for them from the inside . 
   why in the world are rednecks in bumfuckville , alabama hoping for a frexit or hating on brussels ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  they 're all brainwashed by russian propaganda proxies like breitbart and infowars . 
  t_d is literally filled with posts echoing the `` we shall no longer submit to the false song of globalism . '', 
  motto . 
  this is exactly what russia wants . 
  to divide and conquer . 
  and it 's working . 
  why ? 
  because most people are stupid and because it 's easier to hate and destroy something than to work your ass off creating stuff . 
  trump 's whole campaign revolved around fear and hatred . 
  fear and hatred of immigrants . 
  he loses support unless he has an `` enemy '' that his supporters will hate . 
  he can no longer target hillary or obama . 
  that has failed miserably with his wiretapping claims being destroyed . 
  now he 's turning his eye to what the other far right politicians are hating . 
  and that 's globalism and its only manifestation : the eu . 
  macron it is . 
   real spine is taking actions without barking . 
  like [ this ] ( https://komnews.com/turkey-arrests-law-student-made-video-erdogan-reform-bid/ ) ? 
  erdogan is so courageous to jail young people for criticism . 
  and this happens while erdogan calls the eu `` fascists '' ...
