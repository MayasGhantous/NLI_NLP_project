  people in crimea are happy with the new regime , or else ... 
  side hoes are trending . 
   so person a can make a remark and its totally fine but if person b makes the same remark than that person could be prosecuted because they are a `` person of influence '' ? 
  it 's all about public attention . 
  public figures and people of influence are constantly under public scrutiny . 
  a random joe doe has little chance of being reported for saying even death threats . 
  again , it 's not about influence or power , it 's about public scrutiny . 
  laws are applied equally when you see someone breaking them . 
   do that persons remarks become more illegal/immoral the more people get to see it ? 
  they become more likely to get reported because of the public exposure . 
  the laws apply equally to everyone . 
   i can not accept that there would be different standards for innocence/guilt based solely on the persons `` influence '' . 
  i never said that there are or should be . 
  why are you making this assumption ? 
  everyone is born equal and is equal in the eyes of the law . 
  influence and power leads to public exposure which increases the chances for that person to get reported if he/she makes any death threats or any such remarks . 
   i am not okay with telling someone they should be put in jail for denying the holocaust or even for spreading antisemitism , unless it is a direct incitement to violence . 
  true . 
  not all forms of antisemitism are illegal . 
   my argument is not that these hate groups need to exist to educate people about them a line has to be drawn . 
  and it needs to be clear in order to prevent violence and discrimination . 
  if you know that someone is inciting to violence , waiting for the violent act to occur is almost as bad as not doing anything while it 's happening . 
  prevention is the key word here . 
  that 's why death threats are always taken seriously , regardless of the medium of expression . 
   controversial material is , as in my examples , often useful , even if a french populist is using it for political gain  that 's the problem . 
  lepen did not use explicit violent images to stop violence as was the case with the vietnam war , she used those images for political gain ( again nothing illegal here , just immoral ) and to incite violence . 
  she 's the leader of a far right organization with supporters that commit violent acts when things like that get posted . 
  it incites anger and hatred . 
  lepen 's father has a long history of doing just this . 
  whether or not her tweets were inciting violence is a matter of a pending investigation . 
  these things are right on the border between immoral and illegal . 
  you ca n't say for sure whether or not it was illegal . 
  but she clearly incited hatred for political gain . 
  in my opinion , that should always be illegal . 
  a political campaign based on fear , anger and hatred never leads to good things . 
  after trump became president hate crimes increased significantly . 
  [ anti-muslim hate crimes are spiking in the u.s. donald trump wo n't speak up . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-islamophobia-anti-semitism_us_58b08debe4b0780bac2938b4 )  i think harassment should be tackled with harassment laws , and not laws that restrict speech in general . 
  the problem is that if you harass someone with cute cat pictures , you 'll probably not stir hate in others . 
  this would be a singular incident . 
  hate speech and antisemitism , for example , stir hatred in other people . 
  and this happens on a much larger scale because politicians use it for political gain . 
  people have complicated problems and want simple solutions . 
  politicians like lepen and trump use minorities as scape goats and targets for hatred . 
  this makes them popular with people at the expense of the basic rights of those minorities . 
  this is wrong . 
  this needs to stop . 
  people spewing antisemitism and hatred online needs to stop . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqvirecn29a ) 's a good explanation of why this needs to stop . 
  because this has happened before and it did n't lead to good things . 
  people that spew hatred are essentially idiots that ignore history and only repeat . 
  tools for politicians . 
   this is a tactic in conversation that really irks me ; it does nothing but shut out people that `` just do n't understand '' . 
  it 's a perfectly good argument if you actually do n't understand . 
  the stereotype around this argument is that people use it excessively even when people do understand . 
  also , your examples deal with physical pain to which we can all relate and understand . 
  my argument deals with harassment . 
  that 's deeply disturbing on a psychological level . 
  you understand and oppose torture because it 's a highly debated subject . 
  harassment and hate speech and often quickly dismissed on the premise of free speech with arguments like `` fuck you !, 
  i have the right to say whatever i want ! '' . 
  we are on the forefront of this being discussed and handled . 
  things will be much clearer in the future . 
   third , and this may be come across as harsh but ; if you live in the west you can always fight back against someone that is harassing you . 
  the laws being discussed here are aimed towards mass harassment and mass hate speech . 
  sure , you can take action against one person or even a few . 
  but what do you do if a hate speech post about you goes viral ? 
  what do you do if literally thousands of hate speech posts are being posted and shared by people to the detriment of yourself ? 
  there 's not much you can do right now other than ignore it . 
  at that scale and under the current conditions , hate speech and even violence against you is almost inevitable . 
  when a person of importance brings negative attention to another person , there will always be negative consequences . 
  and people need the tools to fight this . 
  tools that actually work . 
  again . 
  you 'll never know how bad this can get until it gets bad . 
  why ? 
  because you 're biased towards free speech . 
  i live in romania . 
  huge protests against the government have been going on here . 
  the portests were peaceful in nature , yet there have been cases where people from the protesters were singled out and harassed by others . 
  those facebook posts are still floating around and doing damage . 
  i tried reporting them every time i saw them , but every single facebook response was an automated one in the lines of `` we found nothing that infringes our terms and conditions '' . 
  this needs to change . 
  when a company is actively aiding the harassment of people , the government needs to step in . 
  when you scren hate speech , it does n't go beyond the ears of those that can hear you . 
  when you post something on facebook or twitter , the hate filled message is shared with thousands of people long after it was written . 
  when you post a hate speech poster on a school bill board , it gets taken down immediately because it uses the billboard to promote hate speech and that makes the school responsible as well , and not just the author of the message . 
   what is the actual discrimination ? 
  here 's the definition for discrimination from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discrimination ) . 
   in human social affairs , discrimination is treatment ** or consideration of ** , or making a distinction in favor of or against , a person or thing based on the group , class , or category to which the person or thing is perceived to belong ** rather than on individual attributes ** . 
  if you hate someone because of their religion , that 's discrimination because your hate is based on that person 's religion . 
   that is the inherent danger with hate speech laws ; the people putting them in place might be bad people that 's the inherent danger with all laws . 
  that does n't mean we should n't have laws just because some crazy wannabe dictator is writing laws for his own benefit that go against human rights . 
  there are even more bad laws than those that govern hate speech in turkey . 
   `` i think all < insert religion  are thieving bastards ! '', 
  it 's discriminatory . 
  you wo n't be legally prosecuted but you might be banned from posting on that platform . 
  if you keep up with these posts , or if you say this as a person of influence , you will be legally prosecuted . 
  it 's all up to how much coverage the post gets or if someone files a complaint . 
  it 's a discriminatory statement for the reasons i stated above .
