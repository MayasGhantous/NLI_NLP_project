  but , again , we do n't know how twitter and facebook handle these things nor how they will handle them in the future . 
   because reddit so far has not been under the threat of fines that are millions of euros per comment . 
  first of all , neither are facebook and twitter . 
  these laws are just being proposed and discussed . 
  there is no `` threat of fines '' . 
  yet reddit does ok while twitter and facebook fail at it . 
  secondly , those fines apply only for `` the individual employee responsible for the complaint procedure '' . 
  nowhere in the article does it say that they will get fined for each mishandled report . 
  that 's a false assumption on your part . 
  read the article . 
   i feel sorry for you if you truly think these are `` conspiracy theories '' . 
  i truly do . 
  you provided no arguments besides conspiracy theories and zero facts to uphold them . 
  here 's a fun fact . 
  present day germany fares very well in regards to respecting basic human rights and that includes freedom of the press . 
  it does way better than the us . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_freedom_indices#list_by_country ) sort the list by `` press freedom index '' or any other index . 
  germany is 7th while the us is 29th , right behind taiwan and just after barbados . 
  the uk is 28th . 
  these are figures from 2016 . 
  ** and that 's a fact . 
  ** feel free to spout more conspiracy theories . 
   how am i discriminating against someone for simply hating them ? 
  because your `` only reason for disliking this man is his religion '' . 
  you 've said that yourself . 
  you then said `` i also dislike anyone that shares his religion and would wish they all got a heart attack today . '', 
  and then `` kill all < insert religion/gender/race  '' that 's religious discrimination and incitement to violence . 
   erdo\u011fan , the president of turkey , considers it his human right not to be insulted did you literally chose a dictator wannabe to preach about human rights ? 
  he also only applies those laws to protect himself from insults . 
  that violates the basic human rights that all men are born equal . 
  turkey is a de facto dictatorship . 
  what 's next ? 
  you 're going to tell me how north korea handles human rights ? 
  these are not democratic states . 
  they do not respect human rights . 
  their opinion on the matter is irrelevant . 
  turkey committed the armenian genocide and you 're using erdogan to preach human rights ? 
  really ? 
   by posting hateful comments about a religion i am not impeding someone from practicing their religion . 
  dude , you literally said `` kill all < insert religion/gender/race  '' . 
   `` i think all creationists are stupid '' not hate speech . 
  discriminatory in the sense that it 's wrong because it generalizes , but it 's not illegal . 
   `` i think all christians are stupid '' the same . 
   `` i think all christian creationists are stupid '' the same . 
  ** insults are not the same as hate speech . 
  ** if you constantly insult specific people or specific groups of people , regardless of your motives , you can be charged for harassment . 
  but they would have to register a complaint or your harassment has to be persistent and hateful for these messages to get taken down by a service provider like reddit or twitter . 
  this already happens . 
  milo yiannopoulos got banned from twitter for something similar . 
  he 'd been harassing and promoting hate speech for years before that happened . 
  besides far right extremists like himself , nobody batted an eye when he got banned . 
  the point is to have these actions taken more swiftly and to prevent them in the future . 
   what about political ideas ? 
  `` i think all mras/feminists/alt right should drop dead right now '' obvious hate speech . 
  why ? 
  because of the `` drop dead '' part . 
  if it were `` stupid '' instead , it would have been ok as long as it was n't perpetual as in harassment . 
   where do you draw the line , personally ? 
  i always think about basic human rights . 
  i ask myself : would these actions limit the free expression of basic human rights for this person or group of people ? 
  if the answer is yes , then the line has been crossed . 
  the problem here is that these are laws being proposed by a government which has history with abuse . 
  nazis abused human rights . 
  the universal declaration of human rights was drafted and signed after world war 2 ended . 
  ** people never get outraged when reddit removes hate speech or even insults . 
  ** ** people only get outraged when governments do it . 
  ** that 's a double standard and it 's wrong . 
  present day germany fares very well in regards to respecting basic human rights . 
  it does way better than the us .

   i 'm legitimately baffled how you can ignore the fact that such a system has n't worked anywhere from a technical standpoint . 
  what system are you talking about ? 
  there is no system yet . 
  the laws have just been proposed . 
  the system has yet to be created . 
   this just tells me the minister has no understanding of how the sites work . 
  he did n't compare the systems , he compared their performance . 
   twitter fared even worse , with only 1 percent of content reported by users deleted ( no change on last year 's test ) , while youtube showed a massive improvement - a 90-percent deletion rate compared to only 10 percent last august . 
  the of this is to show that twitter and facebook are doing nothing to prevent threats and hate speech . 
   but actually convincing a court that certain comments posted online are hate speech is a much much higher hurdle reddit removes death threats and hate speech comments and posts without involving a court . 
  if you were to threaten me right now , i would report you and your comment would be deleted . 
  you 'd probably also get banned . 
  reddit does this by it 's own volition . 
  these new laws want to mandate similar behaviors on twitter and facebook . 
   of course that company is going to be trigger happy with the deletions this is a huge assumption on your part . 
  reddit has been doing this for ages without being trigger happy . 
   to me this entire thing looks more like a way to hurt foreign companies so that local german alternatives can get a bigger market share . 
  you literally have no arguments besides crazy conspiracy theories . 
  this discussion is over . 
   hundreds of `` death threats '' every single day are about as credible as that viagra spam . 
  if you do n't believe people receive death threats , then you 're being severely ignorant . 
  [ a new report finds that anti-semitic death threats have increased significantly during this election cycle . 
  ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/what-its-like-to-be-a-jewish-journalist-in-the-age-of-trump/504635/ )  you ca n't report thousands of twitter messages or facebook posts any better than you can block them . 
  the idea is to allow people to report them as they appear . 
  other people can report hate speech and threats about other people . 
  you do n't have to do it yourself . 
  you 're being intentionally obtuse and you 're ignoring how things work . 
   except when they do n't actually have a leg to stand on .
