  this would just give them one . 
  again , you are being ignorant . 
  death threats and hate speech are illegal in pretty much all civilized countries . 
  [ miami beach man arrested , charged with making death threats against donald trump ] ( http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-beach-man-arrested-charged-with-making-death-threats-against-donald-trump-411077195.html )  keep telling yourself that . 
  if you repeat it enough times people might actually believe you . 
  is this the best argument you can come up with ? 
  i 'm sorry to say this , but it 's pathetic . 
   so you 're telling me that you expect random twitter mods to know exactly when a person that is being accused of being a criminal is actually a convicted criminal ? 
  every single fucking time ? 
  twitter and facebook mods are not random people like on reddit . 
  they are actually paid to do that job and can go through rigorous training . 
  call-center employees have better moderating skills than some subreddit moderators . 
   i think you 're severely underestimating the difficulties of upholding such a system . 
  then again that 's usually par for the course for people that do n't want to think of implementation details . 
  that 's the problem with your logic . 
  you 're dismissing an idea without even considering it . 
  that 's what the article says . 
  that laws are being proposed to do this . 
  this involves open discussions on all aspects , not just technical details . 
  so , instead of dismissing the idea because you do n't know how to implement it , ask other people about it . 
  your opinion is not the only one available . 
   i do n't like waking up every morning to hundreds of spam emails about viagra either . 
  viagra spam is not the same as death threats . 
  you 're clearly not treating this seriously . 
   block the senders ? 
  set up blocking rules for the senders ? 
  you ca n't block thousands of twitter messages or facebook posts . 
  ** nor can you block people sharing info about you . 
  ** you clearly have n't dealt with this before and you 're underestimating the impact it has on people 's lives . 
   i hope you understand that this would actually enable the rich people who get offended to more easily sue the people that offend them . 
  rich people can already sue whomever they want . 
  and have pr firms handle damage control . 
  this is about protecting basic human rights for everyone . 
  or good luck . 
  or both . 
   then what are the other `` attributes '' that are protected and who chooses those attributes ? 
  each country has a list in it 's legal code . 
  that was the wikipedia definition . 
  for specific legal definitions , consult the laws of each country that has hate speech laws . 
   would that video be hate speech ? 
  yes . 
   why ? 
  because your `` only reason for disliking this man is his religion '' . 
  that 's discrimination based on religion . 
  more countries have anti discriminatory laws than those that have anti hate speech laws . 
   i make it clear that i also dislike anyone that shares his religion and would ** wish they all got a heart attack today ** . 
  that 's hate speech . 
   what is the criteria ? 
  dude , it 's easy . 
  ** it 's all about human rights . 
  ** when you say that your `` only reason for disliking this man is his religion '' and you `` wish they all got a heart attack today '' you 're essentially going against the basic human right that says that everyone is entitled to have a religious belief . 
  ** your freedom of speech right is not above the free religious practice right because all rights are equally important . 
  ** there is no ranking for basic human rights . 
  all human rights are equally important and nobody is allowed to go against the rights of others under no circumstances . 
  why ? 
  because they are ** basic human rights ** . 
  your rights end where the rights of others begin . 
  why ? 
  because `` all human beings are born free and ** equal in dignity and rights ** '' . 
  that 's article 1 from the [ universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) . 
  article 2 is even more specific . 
   ** everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration , without distinction of any kind ** , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political ** or other opinion ** , national or social origin , property , birth ** or other status ** . 
  furthermore , no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political , jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs , whether it be independent , trust , non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty . 
  just in case people claim that article 1 is too `` subjective '' . 
   who decides on what qualifies as a part of those protected groups ? 
  the law of each country where words are spoken . 
  not all countries respect and uphold basic human rights . 
   if i am actually telling the truth then legally , at least to my understanding , i can not be charged with any of those crimes this is a different matter . 
  if you accuse a convicted criminal of being a criminal that 's not defamation . 
  it 's defamation when you 're accusing someone of being a criminal when that person was not convicted as a criminal . 
  why ? 
  because it breaks the basic human right that says everyone is innocent until proven guilty . 
  it all goes back to basic human rights . 
  why ? 
  because ** laws are meant to uphold basic human rights ** . 
  it 's that simple . 
  this does n't mean that all laws are perfect or that all countries uphold basic human rights . 
   sharing personal information , sharing private property like pictures , without the permission of the owner those things need to be punished severely but not speech . 
  how about harassment ? 
  would you like to wake up every morning to hundreds of emails with death threats ? 
  how about hundreds of facebook posts that falsely accuse you of being a rapist ? 
  you need to understand the gravity of the problem before you preach for complete and unregulated free speech . 
  these are serious problems that happen on a daily basis . 
  and the people that are being targeted have absolutely no means of defending themselves or even preventing future abuse . 
  they are normal people like you and me that can not afford expensive lawsuits or pr firms . 
  this needs to change . 
  everyone is equal and everyone is entitled to have their rights protected . 
  not just rich people . 
  bro , you 've made only assumptions so far . 
  you literally wrapped yourself in a `` what if '' blanket and did n't even bother to provide arguments for your claims . 
  you literally claimed this is n't about laws when the article clearly says otherwise . 
  this discussion is over . 
   as you can see i mention communities , not companies . 
  the point was to have companies like twitter and facebook offer the community tools to report and remove hate speech posts like antisemitism . 
  you 're grasping for straws , bro . 
   here you are missing the comparision . 
  once speech is deemed illegal in courts its fine if twitter/facebook/whoever remove them . 
  its about not making a private company judge and excecutioner dude , you said that books can not be banned . 
  you 're now switching to an entirely different idea . 
  facebook wo n't be the judge , jury and executioner .
