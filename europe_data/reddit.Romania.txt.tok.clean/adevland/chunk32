  they have to provide the tools for people to judge posts based on reports . 
  and based on those reports the post need to be analyzed and removed if need be . 
  there are absolutely no technical details regarding how this would be done . 
  you 're grasping for straws and assuming things to prove a fictional idea . 
  the point is to enforce real life laws in the online environment . 
   laws have absolutely nothing to do with this conversation right here . 
  dude , did you even read the article ? 
   the ministry is planning ** a new law ** that will force social networks to publish a quarterly accountability report , which will include information on the number and qualifications of employees responsible for deleting and blocking content that breaches germany 's ** hate speech and slander laws ** . 
  it 's about laws . 
  read the article . 
   anyone who wants to harass someone online now already has all the tools needed . 
  that 's the problem that these laws want to address . 
  the internet has little to no accountability and that has to change because people are abusing it . 
   making twitter and facebook remove hate speech by their own standards does not prevent harassment , it prevent critical critisism on society . 
  that 's yet another assumption on your part . 
  there are no technical details regarding to how this will be implemented or even if it will be implemented . 
  you 're literally jumping the horse and assuming the worse . 
  facebook and twitter have serious problems with hate speech and this has to be dealt with . 
  as it stands right now , discussions are being held as to how to deal with these problems . 
  ** instead of assuming the worst , you could propose viable solutions . 
   ** and please [ learn how to use quotations ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting ) . 
  your comments are really hard to read . 
   the holocaust is about systematic killing of an ethnic group . 
  it all started with defamation and exclusion which are commonly known as ** [ antisemitism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism ) ** . 
  i really do n't know what you 're trying to prove here . 
  ethnic and religious discrimination and defamation is a real thing and is still happening . 
  right wing extremists do it all the time . 
  and , yes , it 's illegal . 
  imagine waking up every morning and finding your work and personal email filled with death threats . 
  yeah , sure . . walk away from the screen . 
  then go to a cafe and have your friends ask you what 's up with all those blog posts about your mother . 
  chill , brah !, 
  just walk away . 
  move to alaska . 
  literally chill in sub zero temperatures . 
  big foot ai n't got no hate speech cuz he ai n't real , fam !, 
   if it can be so easily mitigated then how come youtube does n't fix it ? 
  how come reddit does n't fix it ? 
  because they have no legal obligation to do so . 
  that 's what these laws want to fix . 
  youtube actually cracks down pretty hard on copyright infringement because they have a financial incentive to do so . 
  respect and provide tools that uphold basic human rights ? 
   hate speech definition is subjective . 
  no , it 's not . 
   hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation . 
  if you do n't understand it , that 's an altogether different issue . 
   what kind of logic is that ? 
  you said that `` subjecting speech to evaluation by subjective moral criteria creates a precedence '' . 
  this is the basis for the applicability of all laws . 
  any criminal can interpret the law in a way to benefit him , yet he is not the one who does that . 
  you are missing this point entirely . 
   laws in a democratic state as a system are created to protect the rights , freedoms and property of individuals populating the state exactly . 
  and people have the right to dignity and equality . 
  you ca n't spout hate speech against someone and hide behind `` freedom of speech '' . 
  you ca n't break someone 's rights on the basis of another right . 
  your rights are limited to the point where they can not interfere with the rights of others . 
  here 's an example . 
  you have the rights to have a religion . 
  everyone does . 
  but you ca n't forcibly convert others or interfere with their lives on the basis of that being a religious tradition because it breaks other people 's right to have or not have a religion . 
  this is really not a complicated topic . 
  ** you are not superior . 
  you do not have special rights . 
  **  that 's why gay marriage is now legal in us and black people enjoy equality . 
  because there are laws against sexual discrimination and because there are laws against racism . 
  you ca n't hide behind free speech when you call someone the n word or when you harass them based on their sexual preferences . 
  that 's not free speech . 
  that 's hate speech . 
   vocally expressing this hate is a freedom . 
  as long as it 's not libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime it 's a freedom . 
  exactly . 
  that 's what the article says . 
  it 's about implementing real life laws into the online environment . 
  why are we arguing about , then ? 
   but you calling me an asshole has only as much effect on me as i allow it to have . 
  that 's not cyber bullying and you know it . 
  that 's a simple one-time insult . 
  now , if someone were to constantly call you an asshole on various mediums online , that would be akin to cyber bullying and/or defamation . 
  every opinion , if expressed in an obsessive and aggressive manner , has the potential to become harassment . 
  what you 're doing is generalizing and downplaying harassment . 
  you should n't . 
  they are real problems that can not be dealt with unless real world laws are applied online as well . 
   the un and that dumb document are worth less than a peso . 
  so you 're saying that you have no rights ? 
  are you willing to work as a slave ? 
  actually , scratch that . 
  you have no rights . 
  why am i even asking . 
  you got the job !, 
  :d  anyone siding with the united nations really should have their nation bombed into rubble for backing such a dictatorial and worthless organization and its hate speech so countries should bomb themselves ? 
  193/195 countries are un members . 
   so we should ' t express ourselves ? 
  you need to obey the law and respect other people 's rights if you want others to respect yours . 
  and you need to do that in real life and online . 
   the question was could you give me an example of defaming an ethnic/religious group ? 
  the holocaust . 
   that john doe is an bad example as can not be considered hate speech since it 's a person . 
  hate speech can be directed at a person or social group . 
  it was an example of defamation , not hate speech . 
  you asked for an example of defamation .
