   i thing the loopholes are the other way around , when the laws are too vague . 
  again , your opinion is not law . 
  it 's not even argumented . 
   you 're avoiding the question bro . 
  what question am i avoiding ? 
  as long as it 's not  libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime , hate speech against a particular social group , and threats it 's not subject to any of the restrictions being discussed here . 
   subjecting speech to evaluation by subjective moral criteria are you suggesting we should subject them to immoral criteria ? 
  this is exactly what laws do . 
  they subject the actions of people to moral criteria . 
  that 's why stealing is illegal . 
  because it 's immoral . 
   ban people from expressing themselves on facebook and they 'll just move to other , more open platforms . 
  i 'd be happy to show them the door . 
   hell , let 's bring people who are against current immigration policies to courts like so many modern day liberals dream since they sincerely believe these people to be `` literally nazis '' . 
  please stay on topic . 
   well that 's the issue . 
  the law is too vague . 
  laws are sometimes intentionally vague so that loopholes can not be exploited . 
  if laws are very specific , then loop holes appear and get abused . 
   that example is not hate speech due to defamation . 
  you asked for a defamation example . 
   and can you give me a correct example of defamation and libel ? 
  you 're losing track of what you 've said , bro . 
   is blasphemy against say mohammed not considered hate speech/slander/libel / defamation ? 
  blasphemy is a religious concept . 
   [ article 18 . 
  ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ )  everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief , and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in teaching , practice , worship and observance . 
  blasphemy does not appear as a limitation to a basic human right . 
  if you 're referring to prosecution and discrimination based on religious beliefs , then yes , that would be breaking basic human rights . 
  insulting mohammed is not religious discrimination unless you do it to intentionally discriminate or harass someone . 
  you would then be prosecuted for discrimination or harassment . 
  and , for the last time , ** this discussion is not about blasphemy ** . 
  either stay on topic , or this discussion is over . 
  stating it in brackets does n't make it true . 
   an insult is also an attack . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  your opinion is not law . 
   and can you give me a correct example of defamation and libel ? 
  i already gave you the john doe example over [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zc0cq/germany_to_force_facebook_twitter_to_delete_hate/dex31wn/ ) . 
  if you choose to ignore it , that 's your problem . 
   because twitter accounts are hard to make . 
  again . 
  you 're assuming that every new account will be allowed to place reports . 
  either you do n't know how these things work , or you are being intentionally ignorant . 
   yes , and everything that gets reported has to be looked over lest they get fined . 
  you 're assuming this . 
  the fact is there is no way to know how the system will be implemented or if it will even be implemented . 
   now tell me , do you think twitter is going to care more about erroneously deleting your tweet or potentially getting fined ? 
  i 'm not discussing hypothetical scenarios here . 
  i 'm discussing facts . 
  and the fact is that facebook and twitter have a serious problem with hate speech . 
   ok so you can not criticize a culture or ethnic group now . 
  read the article . 
  it says nothing about limiting criticism . 
   social networks will also be obliged to offer users `` an easily recognizable , directly reachable , and constantly available '' complaint process for `` prosecutable content , '' which includes ** libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime , hate speech against a particular social group , and threats ** . 
   not true again nor should there be laws against preaching hate . 
  here 's a [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ) of countries that have laws against hate speech . 
  if the us allows the cult of scientology to harass people , that does n't mean that other countries should do the same . 
  freedom of speech also mandates that you should n't impose your point of view onto others , which is exactly what you are trying to do now . 
   with the way this is phrased you get the situation where report brigading can essentially censor somebody this is a huge assumption on your part . 
  brigading is a technical issue that can be easily mitigated . 
  brigading can be easily mitigated by lowering the weight of each individual report for people who have made erroneous reports . 
   people already love doing that crap on reddit and somewhat on twitter . 
  that 's because reddit and twitter allow them to do it . 
  that 's the purpose of these laws , to prevent and punish harassment where sites failed to do it themselves . 
   making this legally backed will probably be taken seriously . 
  but , again , this is just an assumption . 
  you are literally trying to fight an idea based on how you think it will be implemented . 
  you 've just hit the bottom of the barrel in terms of trying to argument your way in this discussion . 
   if blasphemy is against the law , according to you that 's where freedom of speech ends . 
  read the article . 
  there is no mention of blasphemy restrictions . 
   social networks will also be obliged to offer users `` an easily recognizable , directly reachable , and constantly available '' complaint process for `` prosecutable content , '' which includes ** libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime , hate speech against a particular social group , and threats ** . 
  you are trying to hijack the discussion and divert the topic in order to prove a point that has nothing to do with the current discussion . 
   yeah , and who says what is and is not hate speech in this instance ? 
  the law . 
  hate speech is not an abstract notion . 
   hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ), 
   now , since this is supposed to work off of reports you can guess what 's going to happen to your posts . 
  this is not a fact . 
  it 's an assumption . 
  you 're assuming that the system will be automatic and that it will work exactly how you say it will . 
  and even if it did , the decision can be reversed with evidence . 
  and that would have a negative impact on you and your friends so that your future reports will have little to no credibility . 
   no it 's not nor should it be . 
  this is false . 
  here 's a [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial ) of countries that have laws against holocaust denial . 
   you should n't ban idiocy , just expose it . 
  holocaust denial is not idiocy . 
  it 's intentional malice . 
   actually twitter and facebook are not private communities , they are very public and means of communications . 
  this is false . 
  facebook and twitter are private held companies . 
   actually its not explicitly illegal in all that many countries . 
  so if some country would legalize murder , does that mean that all other countries should do the same ? 
   its not the job of book stores to decide which books are hate speech book that are banned do not make it to print , so it 's not the responsibility of libraries to ban them . 
  here 's a [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_books_banned_by_governments ) of banned books by governments across the world . 
   nowhere in the world can everything be published , although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another : hate speech , for example , is prohibited in a number of countries , such as sweden , though the same books may be legal in the united states or united kingdom , where the only prohibition is on child pornography .
