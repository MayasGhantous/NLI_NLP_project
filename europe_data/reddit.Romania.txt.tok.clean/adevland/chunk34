   its not the job of telephone companies to cut of a call when something wrong is being said this is a bad example . 
  phone conversations are private . 
  also , you fail to grasp the distinction between banning the tool that sends the message , and banning the message . 
  it 's about the message . 
  a conversation is the sole responsibility of the people that take part in it . 
  an ethnic hate propaganda poster glued to a school billboard is the responsibility of the author and the responsibility of the school because the message is being spread via the school billboard . 
  the same goes for facebook and twitter . 
  once a post is made , it 's spread to other people via facebook and twitter servers . 
  it becomes their responsibility as well . 
   they will be risk averse and delete a shit ton of legit points . 
  this is an assumption on your part . 
  it 's like saying that laws do not work and people are wrongfully convicted all the time . 
  this is not true . 
  errors do happen , but laws have to be obeyed . 
  they allow you to have this conversation right now . 
  if not for these laws , you would be harassed by literally anyone and there would be nothing you could do about it . 
   so greeks are not a social group ? 
  greeks are a nationality . 
   what about if i said `` muslim/jews/christian are liar '' . 
  would that be defaimation ? 
  yes . 
   how is that hate speech if are talking about a person . 
  can you give me a correct example of hate speech due to defaimation ? 
  you should read more before engaging in discussions about topics you know little about . 
   [ hate speech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ) is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation . 
   does this mean you support blasphemy laws ? 
  no , i do not . 
  please stay on topic . 
   there 's a scary slippery slope if i ever saw one . 
  you can make a new law tomorrow saying basically anything . . you and i do not make laws . 
  democracy governs over those who make the laws . 
  are you trying to say that people should not obey laws ? 
   your arbitrary laws do n't trump rights . 
  these laws are meant to enforce basic human rights like dignity , equality and the idea that everyone is innocent until proven guilty . 
   for example , a country could theoretically make it legal to kill people you have now deviated from the topic at hand . 
  you 're literally being delusional . 
  laws are meant to protect human rights . 
  are you saying people should not obey the law because it is illegal to promote hate ? 
  is hate towards others a basic human right ? 
  it is n't . 
  you 're being delusional . 
   i am concerned with the potential for abuse . 
  facebook and twitter are already abusing via bans of legitimate content like nude statues while allowing hate speech to roam free . 
  real life laws need to govern these sites just how laws govern what people say in real life . 
   there are plenty of people who would disagree with that there are plenty of people that disagree with the law and plenty who break it . 
  this is about enforcing laws . 
  it 's not about censorship . 
   your loose definition allows them to claim that their rights are being infringed i do not write laws . 
  again . 
  it 's about enforcing laws online . 
  people think that laws do not apply online . 
  this is false . 
  this is about enforcing laws . 
   you can make the inherent into what ever reality you want that is false . 
  the internet is a tool for communication . 
  saying that you can make the internet into whatever reality you want is saying that you can control what people see after they have already seen it . 
  you can not control the information once it 's made public . 
   can you answer my question from previous post ? 
  i already answered both your questions . 
  if you have more or if you want to rephrase any of them , go ahead . 
   so if there are already laws for threats why is this necessary if not for other reasons ? 
  because facebook and twitter hide their servers in other countries to dodge the laws . 
  it 's also extremely complicated to work with them . 
  they essentially remove pics of nude statues for being offensive but tolerate isis recruitment groups that use the platforms for recruiting and inciting to violence and hatred . 
   can you give me an example of defamation . 
  let 's assume that your name is john doe . 
  if john doe is not a convicted criminal , saying that john doe is a criminal is defamation because everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law . 
  that is a basic human right , by the way . 
   does `` greeks are lazy '' is a defamation ? 
  legally , no . 
  because it does n't refer to a specific person or social group . 
  saying this as a public person does have consequences , though . 
   does n't apply to internet because you can just hide posts you clearly do n't know how the internet works . 
  hiding a post does n't delete it . 
  there are also caching services like archive.org that can independently archive anything on the internet . 
  if you can see it , you can archive it . 
  rights and laws apply to everyone . 
  the internet is not exempt from reality . 
   true but ther is a difference between reddit ( which really is a big private community which can set its own rules ) and facebook and twitter all three are `` big private communities '' that have to obey the same laws in the countries in which they operate . 
  they do n't . 
  that 's the problem . 
  the issues are less prevalent on reddit because reddit has community moderators that do most of the work . 
   i will call any holocaust denier an idiot but i 'd march before we have it banned in nl ** holocaust denying is illegal in most civilized countries . 
  ** the point of this is to enforce laws on the internet as well because ** the internet is not exempt from reality ** . 
   defamation who says it 's defamation , slander ? 
  only a judge can . 
  isis uses facebook and twitter as recruitment platforms by encouraging hate and violence . 
  the same goes for other extremist groups . 
  you do n't have to be a judge to read and understand `` kill all < insert ethnic group here  . '', 
  as being hate speech . 
   hey are already covered by law so why is this necessary ? 
  facebook and twitter are filled with hate speech and entities that incite to violence such as far right extremist groups . 
  even isis uses facebook and twitter as recruitment platforms by encouraging hate and violence . 
  those posts are rarely taken down . 
  these laws are not applied online . 
  they need to be because ** the internet is not exempt from reality ** . 
   well for those there are already laws that are applied . 
  yes . 
  and facebook , twitter & co have to obey them because ** the internet is not exempt from real life ** . 
   this is for not saying what the government does n't want .
