  this is false . 
   social networks will also be obliged to offer users `` an easily recognizable , directly reachable , and constantly available '' complaint process for `` prosecutable content , '' which includes ** libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime , hate speech against a particular social group , and threats ** . 
  none of these are referring to the government unless you were planning to make death threats or incite violence against the government . 
  also note that the government is not a social group . 
   that does n't actually list any detailed rights . 
  the same can be said about stealing . 
  by your logic stealing should n't be illegal because you can claim to have borrowed something and prosecution in this case would be an abuse . 
  it 's not . 
  you 're being intentionally pedantic . 
   for example you can claim that blasphemy breaks the `` dignity of religious persons '' or some shit and shut down all criticism of religious authority . 
  saying that god does n't exist does n't infringe any human rights . 
  ** they are not trying to ban insults . 
  **  social networks will also be obliged to offer users `` an easily recognizable , directly reachable , and constantly available '' complaint process for `` prosecutable content , '' which includes ** libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime , hate speech against a particular social group , and threats ** . 
  ** insults are not hate speech . 
  ** people gen insulted online and in real life all the time without being prosecuted . 
  threatening to kill someone or preaching hate towards someone is a prosecutable offense . 
  all civilized countries already have laws in place against hate speech and threats . 
  these laws need to be applicable online as well because ** the internet is not exempt from reality ** . 
   do you have the right not to be offended ? 
  all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  hate speech goes beyond being offended . 
  ** they are not trying to ban insults . 
  **  social networks will also be obliged to offer users `` an easily recognizable , directly reachable , and constantly available '' complaint process for `` prosecutable content , '' which includes libel , slander , defamation , incitement to commit a crime , hate speech against a particular social group , and threats . 
  they want sites to allow users to report hate speech so that it can be removed and prosecuted . 
  if someone were to start a blog with threats against you and they were to post them on these sites , you would have the ability to report these posts and have them removed ** because you have the right to dignity and everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law ** . 
  it sucks that it takes for crises like these for people to band together . 
  but you are right . 
   article 1 . 
   all human beings are born free and ** equal in dignity and rights ** . 
  they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . 
  from the [ universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) . 
  that 's why hate speech and cyber bullying should not be tolerated . 
  they are illegal in real life . 
  they should be illegal online as well . 
  ** the internet is not exempt from reality . 
  ** these rules are already enforced here on reddit as well as on other sites . 
  this is not about censorship . 
   `` in a lively democracy , freedom of speech can also protect repugnant and ugly statements - even a lie can be covered by freedom of speech , '' said maas . 
  `` but ** freedom of speech ends where the law begins ** . 
  there should be just as little room for incitement and slander on social networks as on the street . '', 
  this is false . 
   the turkish election commission published a decision ** expanding on the general election law and relevant to the referendum on february 15 ** , confirming that ** propaganda abroad or at border crossings were not permitted ** . 
   sezgin tanrikulu , a member of turkish parliament from the chp , told dpa that indeed the law banned campaigning abroad , but noted that no criminal liability is attached to the provision . 
  rather it is a `` moral obligation . '',

   let people say what they want and let the others confront them . 
  perjury , libel and cyber bullying are real world problems that exist online and should not be tolerated . 
  why ? 
  ** because your rights end where the rights of others begin .

   referring to the austrian , danish , dutch , and german bans on turkish ministers attending pro-erdogan rallies in turkish expat communities , he added : `` nazism , we can call this neo-nazism . 
  a new nazism tendency , '' he said . 
  this is funny because under turkish law , campaigning abroad is illegal . 
   overseas election campaigning , even in diplomatic missions , is illegal under turkish law ; yet most political parties in turkey including the ruling akp have flouted the law . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_dutch%e2%80%93turkish_diplomatic_incident ) this whole thing is being poorly managed by the eu leaders . 
  they could have flaunted the turkish law in front of erdogan and everything would have ended there . 
  erdogan is cherry picking when his own laws are being applied . 
  apparently , they only apply to his opposition . 
  he 's using the eu as a punch bag to gain support in turkey . 
  the eu leaders are really that stupid as to not see this ?

   mega super duper win-win for politicians . 
  the people will suffer . 
  that 's how all revolutions started . 
  i 'm a pretty patient person . 
  when it comes to facts and opinions , they usually run out of insults before i run out of facts and arguments . 
   i see no reason to discuss with you further . 
  there 's been no discussion because you 've brought no arguments to be discussed , but , sure . 
  run away . 
  you did your part . 
  spreading propaganda is a hit and run game , after all . 
   you are just trying to dismiss my opinion by calling it propaganda , a completely baseless accusation . 
  your opinion is baseless . 
  you 've brought no arguments to uphold it . 
  that 's the textbook definition of propaganda . 
  yell it loud and clear so that many people hear it . 
   propaganda is `` information , especially of a biased or misleading nature , used to promote a political cause or point of view '' . 
  in this case , you 're trying to discredit the comparison made by the constitutional law professor between the us and turkey . 
  if you really wanted to discuss the issue , you would have brought up arguments to uphold your opinion . 
   off course facts and constructive criticism is vital for any democratic and enlightened state . 
  then why are n't you bringing any to the discussion . 
  so far you 've hidden behind the `` it 's my opinion . '', 
  wall when calling the assertions in the article as being untrue .
