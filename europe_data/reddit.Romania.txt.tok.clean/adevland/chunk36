  this is me calling you out on your bs . 
  you do n't have to be affiliated with anyone to spread propaganda . 
  what we need is more opininons and less facts . 
  who wants facts and constructive criticism ? 
  if the democratic vote does n't work , you can always revolt . 
  it 's sad that there are such harsh laws in turkey regarding political opposition . 
  it 's going to be a tough battle . 
  stay strong and resist . 
   my criticism was not about the act but about the method . 
  you made no criticism other than calling it convenient . 
  that 's not criticism . 
  that does n't go beyond the statute of `` personal opinion of a random stranger on the internet '' . 
   i 'm down to debate things but i 'd prefer to do it with someone whose reading skills are above kindergarten level . 
  insults are uncalled for . 
  you either do n't have the ability to argument your position or you do n't have the evidence to uphold those arguments . 
  either way , insults do n't win an argument . 
  enjoy your stay at the bottom of the barrel . 
  grab a few friends and family members on your way . 
  :d make a vacation out of your civic duty . 
   teach the kids important democratic values . 
  autocrats like erdogan and trump always need an enemy . 
  they can not function otherwise because their only power of persuasion is hate . 
  that 's why trump is constantly attacking obama with false claims . 
  to incite people for support . 
  this does not work indefinitely . 
  people will eventually see through the bullshit . 
  i 'm not predicting the future here . 
  this is all history repeating itself . 
   there 's a difference of culture , laws and institutions . 
  comparing us and eu politics like that is a tad too convenient . 
  comparisons are motivated by differences . 
  you can compare whatever you want as long as there is common ground . 
  comparing two presidential governments that abuse their power is very useful so that this does not spiral out of control . 
  both the us and turkey are flirting with autocracy . 
  turkey more so . 
  studying and comparing the two should be encouraged , not dismissed based on political preference . 
  you literally provided no arguments as to why the comparison is not useful other than your gut instinct . 
   i 'm still allowed to share my opinion about the article . 
  saying something is untrue without providing evidence is called propaganda . 
   the statement is untrue . 
  thank you , random internet stranger , for interpreting constitutional law for us and dismissing what a constitutional law professor and other experts have been saying for ages . 
  your word is all we need . 
  go out and vote `` no '' . 
  totally makes sense . 
  if you 're a nationalist and you want to protect your country from foreign interest , you 'd totally accept us money to promote those ideals . 
  the first issue may be serious , but is still unproven , right ? 
  the second one is more of a political appraisal . 
  did he make promises that he did n't keep ? 
  or was his plan to do so all along ? 
  by comparison to trump or putin , he seems like a nice guy . 
  so there are no controversies surrounding tusk , right ? 
  who is donald tusk and why did his home country object to his reelection ? 
   so the recovery is not just down to the oil price ? 
   well , it is a bit . 
  oil prices are rising following the opec agreement on output cuts last year . 
  russia overtook saudi arabia as the word 's largest crude producer in december as both nations started adhering to the agreed cuts . 
  it 's mostly oil revenue . 
   what about ordinary russians , how are they doing ? 
   while retail sales are yet to catch up and move into positive territory , they have curbed their decline , the federal statistics service said feb 22 . 
  this is good . 
  nobody wants to see people hurting . 
  ...  are n't sanctions hurting ? 
   the economy would undoubtedly get a lift if the trump administration -- currently embattled because of alleged links to russia -- decides to ease the restrictions the government has already imposed . 
  according to the majority of economists surveyed by bloomberg , ** the ruble would gain 5 percent to 10 percent in value in such a case ** . 
  the russian government 's stubbornness over attacking ukraine is holding back the economy severely . 
  oil does n't last forever and prices will go down in the next decade as electric cars start to become mainstream . 
   do n't tell me a food store is a restaurant , you liar . 
  again , what 's your point ? 
  [ here 's a food store in the us . 
  ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=food+store+in+new+york&amp;oq=food+store+in+new+york&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5135j0j1&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8#q=food%20store%20in%20new%20york&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;rllag=40744408,-73991108,2359&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;rldimm=16007031328765337775&amp;tbs=lf_msr:-1,lf_od:-1,lf_oh:-1,lf_pqs:eae,lf:1,lf_ui:10&amp;* )  speak about the things you know . 
  i did . 
  i spoke about communism in romania . 
  you 're making no sense . 
  that 's a restaurant from russia . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i never said there is n't food in russia . 
  read my comment . 
  the other guy asked for  one example from history when sanctions were effective and turned citizens against their leader . 
  i gave him the example of how communism fell in romania . 
  got a source for that ? 
   it 's huge hyperbola to say that there 's no food in markets read my comment one more time . 
  it was about communism in romania . 
  please do n't take things out of context . 
  you asked for  one example from history when sanctions were effective and turned citizens against their leader . 
  i then talked about how communism fell in romania . 
   not that shit again please . 
  how about '' ** us sanctions are hurting russians ** '' ? 
  is that better ? 
  they both say the same thing . 
  the sanctions are direct consequences to putin 's actions in ukraine . 
  if you want to fix the problem , you need to fix the root cause and not its consequences . 
  that 's how communism fell in romania . 
  self imposed sanctions drove people to the brink of not having food in markets . 
  i remember seeing , as a kid , entire rows of jam jars in supermarkets . 
  there was literally no meat to be found . 
  all of the good food was being sent off to export . 
  sanctions do the same thing . 
  propaganda can feed the soul with hatred , but the body will ask for more . 
  russia is a revolution waiting to happen . 
  either ukraine is left alone , or people will revolt .
