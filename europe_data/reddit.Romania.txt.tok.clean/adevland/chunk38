   who is supposed to save the message , the offending parties ? 
  the service provider . 
  [ yahoo already does this . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-nsa-exclusive-iduskcn1241yt ), 
  they usually do n't get identified . 
  that 's bad for business . 
  people here seem to forget that ** it 's about legislation ** and not about technical details . 
  encryption ca n't be broken , but ** the message can be saved for later retrieval ** . 
  it 's a bad idea because most terror attacks were planned in the open via sms and other non encrypted communication methods . 
  it 's about legislation and not about technical details . 
  encryption ca n't be broken , but the message can be saved for later retrieval .

   as applied to the peaceful protesters it is . 
  the constitutional court did not find the article to be unconstitutional . 
  ** the law is still in effect . 
  ** peaceful protesters can still go to jail . 
  this is unacceptable under any circumstances . 
   what ???????????? 
  that 's the decision of russian constitutional court and russian supreme court . 
  it ca n't be any farther from opinion . 
  below from your own article . 
   the constitutional court ** did not find the article to be unconstitutional ** but ruled that criminal punishment for these violations must be proportionate to the actual public danger caused by an offense . 
  furthermore , courts are now required to prove a person 's criminal intent to commit such violations . 
  the law is still in effect . 
  below from the second article . 
   on 10 february the court issued its ruling , stating that ** legislation in question is not unconstitutional ** , but its implementation should be limited . 
  the law is still in effect . 
  people can still go to jail for peacefully protesting . 
  courts can still arbitrarily decide how `` dangerous '' someone is and give them a `` proportional '' punishment . 
  ** the law is still in effect . 
  ** the glimmer of hope is that dadin won . 
  and this sets a good precedent for future cases . 
  but the fight is not over . 
  people can still go to jail for peacefully protesting and this is not acceptable under any circumstances . 
   i 've lost all my trust to english wikipedia after this delutional bullshit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics . 
  that 's a wikipedia article about a book . 
  are you blaming wikipedia for the content of the book ? 
   ignore these rules , even peacefully , and you get a warning or a ban . 
  you do n't go to jail if you ignore reddit 's rules . 
   peacefully = / = legally why are you towering over this ? 
  this was not my point . 
  if russia outlaws breathing you 'd be saying that peacfully breathing = / = legal . 
  the problem is the law itself . 
  russia is one of the few countries in the world where ** peaceful protests are illegal and are punished with jail time ** . 
  ** peaceful protest are a basic human right ** and almost all civilized countries allow them without any repercussions . 
  these are facts . 
  whatever you say will not change that . 
  this discussion is over . 
   the recent ruling by russian constitutional court found this law unconstitutional . 
  that 's false as stated from your own article . 
   ** the constitutional court did not find the article to be unconstitutional ** but ruled that criminal punishment for these violations must be proportionate to the actual public danger caused by an offense . 
  furthermore , courts are now required to prove a person 's criminal intent to commit such violations . 
  it 's a step in the right direction , but the law is still active . 
   so at this point , both of the highest courts in russia dismissed the law which means that it has 0 power . 
  this is false . 
  read your own article one more time . 
   russian highest court examined the law that this wikipedia article references and decided that `` no , you can not use this law to jail `` peaceful single-person picket '' . 
  that 's what the whole dadin 's case story , that you 've mentioned , is about . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  the sources i mentioned say otherwise . 
  so far you failed to provide any evidence or sources for your claims and you were proven wrong by facts . 
   read the fucking articles you post . 
  let me remind you if you are incapable of doing even a little research by your self . 
  dugin was arrested and convicted based on a law . 
  that law prohibits peaceful protests . 
  you conveniently continue to omit this even when provided with the text of the law . 
  you are clearly biased and you 're omitting facts . 
  you 've also insulted me . 
  this discussion is over . 
   english wikipedia as a reference of russia 's law ? 
  you must be kidding . 
  wikipedia articles are maintained by people all over the world . 
  look up any other source and you 'll find the same text for the law . 
   people have right to protest something to remember ...  since 2014 , holding a demonstration without the permission of authorities , ** even a peaceful single-person picket ** , is punishable by a fine or detention of up to 15 days , or ** up to five years in prison if it is the third breach ** .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_assembly_in_russia#legislation ) three strikes and you 're out ... ahem . . in !, 
   no , the fact that you are a peaceful protester does n't give you immunity from laws . 
  the same thing is happening in russia . 
  exactly !, 
  russia is one of the few countries in the world where peaceful protesters can go to jail because ** there are laws that put them in jail ** . 
   there is no law against peaceful protests . 
  and no i will not accept `` this is false '' as an argument . 
  please provide a source for your imaginary law . 
  dude ... 
  i just did that in the previous comment . 
  did n't you read it ? 
   since 2014 , holding a demonstration without the permission of authorities , ** even a peaceful single-person picket ** , is punishable by a fine or detention of up to 15 days , or ** up to five years in prison if it is the third breach ** . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_assembly_in_russia#legislation ) ** in russia people can go to jail if they peacefully protest more than three times !, 
   that 's how things work . 
  everywhere , no just russia . 
  this is false . 
  russia is one of the few countries in the world where peaceful protesters can go to jail . 
   the judiciary is a huge and complicated system in pretty much every country , russia is no exception here . 
  russia is one of the few countries in the world where protesters can go to jail . 
  all other civilized countries do not jail peaceful protesters . 
   and in this particular case , one of the fail-safes embedded in the system worked .
