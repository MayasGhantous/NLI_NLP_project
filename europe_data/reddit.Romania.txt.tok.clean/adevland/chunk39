  how you can consider it to be a bad thing is beyond me . 
  peaceful protests should not be punished with jail time . 
  in russia they are as of 2014 . 
   clearly not as biased as you , as you think that person being acquitted after following a proper legal route , is somehow a bad thing ... 
  i said the law was bad . 
  as of 2014 peaceful protesters can be jailed for up to 5 years if they peacefully protest more than 3 times . 
   since 2014 , holding a demonstration without the permission of authorities , ** even a peaceful single-person picket ** , is punishable by a fine or detention of up to 15 days , or ** up to five years in prison if it is the third breach ** . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_assembly_in_russia#legislation ), 
   there is no such law . 
  this is false . 
   ** before addition article 212.1 to russia 's criminal code in july 2014 dadin could be sentenced to pay fine or a suspended prison term . 
  ** but according to the new article 212.1 , if a court has issued two rulings on administrative offences within 180 days the law opens up a sentence of up to 5 years in a prison colony . 
  this was the decision taken by the basmanny court in moscow and which condemned dadin to three years in prison . 
  the prosecutor had asked for a shorter sentence of two years . 
   the punishment was later reduced to 2.5 years . 
  dadin was not allowed to be in the court during the appeal case . 
  the law was amended in 2014 so that protesters can be jailed . 
   since 2014 , holding a demonstration without the permission of authorities , ** even a peaceful single-person picket ** , is punishable by a fine or detention of up to 15 days , or ** up to five years in prison if it is the third breach ** .

   everyone has some limitation on protests , or do you want random bunch of people protesting consumption of baby carrots on the motorway on your way to work ? 
  there 's a very big leap from limiting where protests can happen to actually jailing people for protesting . 
  russia has already made that leap . 
   not only that , it 's a right according to russian constitution . 
  and guess what , that dude was acquitted . 
  he should n't have been jailed in the first place . 
  the anti peaceful protests laws permitted this . 
  they need to go . 
   apart from some actual dictatorships where appeals are not allowed , but as you can see it 's clearly not a case in russia . 
  the guy was jailed from december 2015 until february 2017 for peacefully protesting . 
  ** you 're trying to make it sound like russia was nice for letting him go while ignoring that he should n't have been jailed in the first place and that they have laws against peaceful protests . 
  ** you are clearly biased . 
   usa had a revution , but i 'd hardly say revolutions are in its blood . 
  usa and russia are two very different countries with almost opposing cultures . 
  protests in russia are likely to have a greater impact just because of the anti-protests laws . 
  protests are largely ignored in the us , with representatives choosing not to face their voters . 
  the recent town halls prove this . 
  anyway , i do agree that russia has had way fewer protests , but i think that 's because of the soviet union which systematically jailed dissidents . 
  moderns russia is trying to do the same thing now with their new anti-protest laws and this is n't ok . 
   you are talking like it 's only in russia where appeals exist ( are appeals evil now ? 
  anti protests laws are evil . 
   if you do n't pay taxes , you also do n't pose any threat , but you still might go to jail ... 
  this is a shitty comparison . 
  [ peaceful protests are a basic human right . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_to_protest ) not paying your taxes is not a right . 
  that guy was sentenced to 2.5 years in jail for peacefully protesting against the government . 
  this is the mark of a dictatorship . 
   italian spent 20 years in jail for murder by mistake . 
  the russian dude was n't jailed for murder and he was n't jailed by mistake . 
  he was jailed on purpose based on laws that prohibit peaceful protests . 
  releasing him 2.5 years later is not an act of mercy of clemency . 
  it 's an act of intimidation . 
  the russian state is sending a message that `` this could happen to you if you protest against the state '' . 
  the protests that are happening right now confirm this . 
   the march coincided with the release of an anti-kremlin activist ildar dadin from a siberian prison on sunday . 
  he was the first person jailed under new rules that made some forms of non-violent protest a criminal offense . 
   i also do n't know what you 're referring to when you say `` it was n't a big thing . '', 
  that was a question , not a statement . 
  you missed the '' ? '', 
  at the end . 
   i stand by my comment that the ussr was a patrimonial state that used it 's people like cattle . 
  you said that  [ i do n't think revolutions have ever been part part of russian culture . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wa90y/thousands_march_in_moscow_to_honor_kremlin_critic/de96mt2/ ) but you ignored the fact that the ussr came to be because of the russian revolution . 
  arguably the biggest event in russian history happened because of a revolution . 
   dadin was the first russian to be convicted under controversial new anti-protest laws in november 2015 . 
  the legislation prosecutes demonstrators who `` repeatedly '' hold unsanctioned protests , effectively outlawing public dissent which has not been pre-approved by the russian government . 
   judges ruled on wednesday that while the law was legal under the russian constitution , it should only be used against protesters who `` posed a threat '' to russian society . 
   ** they confirmed that dadin -- who was jailed for 2.5 years under the law -- had been a `` peaceful '' protester . 
  ** [ source . 
  ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russias-supreme-court-releases-jailed-activist-ildar-dadin-57239 ) so the guy posed no threat , as he was confirmed a peaceful protester , and was released after 2.5 years in jail . 
  ** why did it take them 2.5 years to figure that out ? 
   and it was n't even that revolutionary . 
  oh , really ? 
   the russian revolution was a pair of revolutions in russia in 1917 , which dismantled the tsarist autocracy and led to the eventual rise of the soviet union . 
  so the soviet union was n't a big thing ? 
  you 're ignoring almost a century of russian history . 
  [ political dissidents were imprisoned by the communists .

   the march coincided with the release of an anti-kremlin activist ildar dadin from a siberian prison on sunday .

   i do n't think revolutions have ever been part part of russian culture . 
  you really need to read more of your country 's history . 
  [ russian revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_revolution ), 
   romania does n't have a leg to stand on when it comes to civil liberties and human rights . 
  do you have any arguments to support that ? 
  or are you just trying to insult me ? 
  we do n't jail protesters . 
  we actually just had massive protests with 600 000 attending . 
   you are responsible for 30 % of comments in this topic apparently nobody cares if russia jails protesters . 
  that 's great , is n't it ? 
   the guy spent about 1 year and 3 months in jail , not 2.5 as you thought . 
  russia so nice . 
  they only jailed protester for 1 year and 3 months even though they admitted he did n't do anything . 
  yep . 
  this clearly fixes the wrong that was done . 
   now you want to reply sarcastically that russia is a true paradise as they only jail activists for 1 year and 3 months to draw attention away from the fact that you have minimal knowledge of the issue before commenting on it . 
  yep . 
  the best paradise . 
  in turkey they give you the full sentence .
