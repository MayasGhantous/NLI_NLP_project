  ** it 's really that simple . 
   downplaying it as nazi germany occupation was `` just another government '' . 
  i do n't agree with your view on this at all . 
  you 're ignoring history . 
   after being ** appointed ** premier by president albert lebrun , marshal p\u00e9tain ordered the french government 's military representatives to sign an ** armistice ** with germany on [ 22 june 1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ) . 
  the french government surrendered and accepted nazi rule . 
  all their actions are the actions of the french government because it was the same government that surrendered . 
  they surrendered and they rounded up jews for deportation to death camps . 
  these are the same people . 
  they were the government before and during nazi occupation . 
  these are the facts . 
  denying them wo n't make them go away . 
   we 're talking about a case when the state stopped existing . 
  france did n't stop existing . 
  it surrendered and accepted nazi rule . 
  the same people were running the country when france surrendered and deported jews as before the nazi occupation . 
   the operation was backed by about 3500 volunteers . 
  that makes things even worse . 
  the volunteers backed the french government . 
   becouse they were loyal to nazi germany , not france which proves my point . 
  these people were the same that were running france before the occupation . 
  p\u00e9tain was appointed premier by president albert lebrun . 
  albert lebrun was president from 1932 . 
  you are ignoring history . 
   surrender does n't mean that someone is willingly accepting nazi rule . 
  ** the people that surrendered are the same that accepted nazi rule and carried out their orders . 
  ** you are being ignorant . 
  you are ignoring history .

   le pen does n't deny any of this . 
  she says those people , who were french , did those things and are responsible for it . 
   she added : `` i think that , generally speaking , if there are people responsible , it 's those who were in power at the time . 
  it 's not france . '' she specifically blames the nazis for what french people did as french authorities . 
   le pen later issued a statement saying : `` like charles de gaulle and fran\u00e7ois mitterrand ... [ i consider that ] france and the republic were in london during the occupation '' . 
  she added that the nazi-collaborationist vichy regime `` was not france '' . 
  france did n't go to london during ww2 . 
  if france went to london , then who stayed ? 
  what about the french people that made the roundup ? 
  what about the french people that formed the resistance ? 
  these were people that stayed in france . 
  the difference is that some chose to be in charge and obey nazi orders , while others where fighting them . 
  ** french people were fighting other french people . 
  they were fighting their own government . 
  **  it 's still an absolute falsity that vichy was the french government or representative of the french republic . 
  did n't france surrender ? 
  who surrendered if not the french government ? 
   after being ** appointed ** premier by president albert lebrun , marshal p\u00e9tain ordered the french government 's military representatives to sign an ** armistice ** with germany on [ 22 june 1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ) .

  these are the facts . 
  denying them wo n't make them go away . 
  why are you consistently ignoring my other questions ? 
  ** if france is not responsible for executing the roundup , then who is ? 
  ** because the nazis did n't do it . 
  there are tons of documents and witnesses that show how the french police made the roundup by following nazi orders . 
  these were french citizens carrying out nazi orders . 
  if the french government from the time is n't responsible , then who is ? 
  ** france surrendered . 
  it willingly accepted nazi rule . 
  ** why did france surrender only to then deny responsibility for the things it did ? 
  the least france could do is publicly acknowledge responsibility and issue a formal apology to the victims . 
  the roundup happened on french soil and it was carried out by french people that worked for the french police . 
  saying that it happened under occupation is irrelevant . 
  other countries did n't accept nazi occupation and forced hitler to send nazis to govern them . 
   modern france is n't the legal continuation of puppet vichy france where there 's a general consensus that it was a german puppet state . 
  bro , you 're arguing semantics . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for any argument . 
  there is no `` alternate france '' that existed during the occupation . 
  the people were the same as before and stayed the same after the occupation . 
  a country can not dismiss responsibility for the atrocities it committed by saying that there was a puppet government in place during that time . 
  governments change constantly even under democracy . 
  the responsibility lies on the country as a whole . 
  future governments have to take the responsibility upon themselves in order to prevent such things from happening again . 
  ** if france is not responsible for executing the roundup , then who is ? 
  **  there was france as a culture and people , under occupation . 
  citizens did not execute the roundup . 
  citizens organized a resistance while the vichy government obbeyed nazi orders . 
  was n't the vichy government a french government ? 
  where they not french living and governing france from france ? 
  why did they execute nazi orders while others were organizing the resistance ? 
  why did n't they join the resistance and force the nazis to run things themselves ? 
   a state that did n't cotrol a territory is n't responsible for crimes that were done there on the ground at that time , just like hague convention iv states . 
  again . 
  was the french government not made up of french people ? 
  france surrendered . 
  it willingly accepted nazi rule . 
  everything after that is their responsibility since the nazi orders were carried out by french people who made up the french government . 
  they willingly did this while others were forming the resistance . 
  why did n't they join the resistance and force the nazis to govern france themselves ? 
   there was no `` me '' understood as a soverign french state during the time the nazis did not run france . 
  french people did .
