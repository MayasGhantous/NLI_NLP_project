  russia is going down the `` divide and conquer '' path while using fake news to divide people . 
  i disagree . 
  there 's no political pressure from the us army bases . 
  the forces are routinely changed and can be evicted entirely . 
  they are there because of a mutual agreement between the us and the host country . 
  there 's always some form of tie . 
  did they pay tribute ? 
  that 's how some of them bought their independence and paved the road towards official independence . 
  read [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5sojxg/most_europeans_want_immigration_ban_from/ddgsg7n/ ) . 
  keep in mind that this was poll was done exclusively online which means participants were volunteering . 
   while we appreciate people who want to participate , we ca n't base our polls on volunteers . 
  a survey of volunteers is a `` non-probability sample '' and the results can not be generalized to the public as a whole . 
  still , those bases have to abide by the laws and regulations of the country they are stationed in . 
  it 's not like the host country gets orders from the us . 
  that 's the key difference . 
  colonies are not independent . 
   but when one member has active forces and military bases all over your country it 's hard not to feel like a colony .

   most people are now pro-eu tell that to the french that got brain-washed by le pen and fake news . 
  opposing trump is so easy and gives such a huge boost to popularity that it 's almost unfair . 
  almost . 
  this is what happens when you build bridges instead of walls . 
  being voted into office does n't give you the freedom to do whatever you want . 
  nobody is above the law . 
  that includes trying to change the law to legalize abuse of power . 
  are people still supporting her for the elections ? 
  `` there was no invasion of crimea , but i did receive russian funding for my campaign . '', 
  politics is very important . 
  ignoring it always gets you into trouble . 
  and when you finally figure it out , it 's usually too late . 
   sometimes , a little bit of shitposting is good for the soul . 
  i 'm ok with this . 
   as long as it 's of good quality and makes you smile . 
  is n't that a form of hypocrisy ? 
  this breaks rule 4 : no image macros , memes , reaction gifs and similar low-effort content . 
  that must be it . 
  smaller countries give citizens more power over their government . 
  what 's up with uruguay ? 
  why are they so high on the list ? 
   citizenship is really something on paper , while american is something much more intangible and linked with ideas/culture/way of thinking . 
  is it the `` american way '' to force a reporter out of a press conference because he asked an uncomfortable question ? 
  tl ; dr : uk citizens will pay for it . 
   wtf does le pen have to do with this ? 
  fuck her and her cheap populism . 
  [ this . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9uzb3bt.jpg ) france is bound to go the same path as the uk if extremism gets to power . 
  it is . 
  winners get a functional democracy and a better way of living . 
   you 've tried peaceful means , time to get violent ? 
  violence is always the last option . 
  there are still peaceful and legal options being set in motion right now . 
   the french tried dealing with their elite peacefully , and got infamously told to eat cake . 
  we all know what came next . 
  le pen came next . 
   try it and learn how that is n't propaganda . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's not an argument . 
  your opinion is n't fact . 
  i already argumented mine with facts . 
  here 's a more detailed analysis about [ propaganda ] ( https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/100-years-of-propaganda-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/ ) . 
   propaganda is most well known in the form of war posters . 
  but at its core , it is a mode of communication aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position , and that does n't have to be a bad thing . 
  although propaganda is often used to manipulate human emotions by displaying facts selectively , it can also be very effective at conveying messages by always associating propaganda with misleading information you are generalizing . 
  it 's the same thing as saying that `` all muslims are terrorists '' just because lots of terrorists are muslims . 
  this is a false statement . 
  as you should treat each human individual individually , so you must do with propaganda . 
  by denying a message just because it 's presented in a certain manner you just prove that you 're prejudiced and not open minded . 
  prejudice leads to indoctrination . 
   you do n't need biased or misleading information to promote truth . 
  read the definition one more time . 
  propaganda is n't always biased or misleading . 
   propaganda is `` information used to promote a political cause or point of view '' . 
  read the wikipedia article as well . 
   propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments , but activist groups and companies can also produce propaganda . 
  propaganda promotes ideas . 
  it 's just a tool for the messenger . 
  do n't blame the tool for how it 's used . 
  pro-environment or anti trump rallies use boards with slogans on them . 
  those are propaganda messages . 
  if i write in bold letters ** education is good !, 
  ** that 's propaganda . 
  it 's up to you to figure out if it 's misleading or a fact . 
  propaganda can be either good or bad . 
  it 's up to you to figure it out . 
  to not fall for it . 
  propaganda can also be good . 
   [ propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda ) is `` information , especially of a biased or misleading nature , used to promote a political cause or point of view '' . 
  it 's usually biased or misleading , but it can also be used to promote truth and positive ideas . 
  here is an [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23x14hs4glk ) , which is , sadly , still relevant today . 
  divide and conquer . 
  it 's so obvious that everyone is ignoring it . 
  misinformation and fake news . 
  it 's the latest trend sweeping the planet . 
  it 's an on-going race . 
  it never ends . 
  not even for the victor . 
   politicians are flipping us off and theres no one to replace them with . 
  create a new party and educate the people to not listen to the lies of the corrupt . 
  it 's an uphill battle . 
  if people do n't know what to do , they do nothing .
