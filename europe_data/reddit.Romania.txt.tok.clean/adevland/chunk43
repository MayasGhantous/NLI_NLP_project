  some people are still doing this while others are crying that the eu is n't forcing them to have more rules . 
  both of these types of people voted for brexit in the uk . 
   but if you read the article you will learn that some people from the uk are also victims obviously . 
  this is happening all over the world . 
  the point is that the majority of victims are not from the uk . 
  the majority of victims are being brought to the uk . 
  why is that happening ? 
  why are they being brought to the uk in such large numbers ? 
  the article does n't mention who buys them . 
  but they are being brought to the uk from other poorer countries . 
  what does that say to you ? 
   this is not being sold . 
   it might violate child labor law , but it 's not slavery . 
  did you `` not sell '' your kids into slavery ? 
  are they away in a foreign country doing work for which you are being paid ? 
  is that legal in america ? 
   if we had no muslims in europe , we would not have attacks against them . 
  or , you 'd have no attacks against them if there were no attacks against them because attacks against people are not ok . are you trying to justify attacks against muslims ? 
   you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  you know those tourists you see in the old center of bucharest being drunk as fuck ? 
  as long as they 're civil , they can be as drunk as they want . 
   imagine a city full of those types of individuals , or even worse , full of middle-aged americans unaware of how fat they are ... with cameras . 
  does the image of `` fat '' americans disturb you ? 
   welp 2 million tourists in the last 3 months for the city of 1.2 million is just too much . 
  did all those 2 million tourists come all at the same time ? 
  did they all stay for the entire 3 month period ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  people are overreacting . 
  go to new york and see how a crowded city really looks like . 
  or beijing . 
  i 've never thought i 'd see the day . 
  this is a `` problem '' that some countries would love to have . 
  make sure to send all the extra tourists our way . 
  we could use their business . 
   did you not read it ? 
  it says victims . 
  it says that  people from eastern europe , vietnam and nigeria were the most common ** victims brought to the uk ** , mr kerr said . 
  they were brought to the uk as slaves . 
   he gave one example of a 12-year-old roma girl who was stopped at border control and had been bound for a life as a domestic slave . 
   he said : `` she was being brought in to work for a family in part of the uk , where she had effectively been sold by her father - or it had been facilitated by her father - and she was being brought in to take this family 's children to school and pick them up every day , and clean the house in between . 
  these people are being brought to work in the uk as slaves . 
  for whom are they working ? 
  why are they being brought to the uk ? 
  it 's clear that uk people are not the victims . 
   because the report clearly states that there was violence between south ossetians , georgian and abkhazians all way through 2008 ( and does n't state who started that ) , so clearly the attacks on august 1st could n't be `` the first act of violence '' . 
  on this we can agree . 
  the whole thing is surrounded in uncertainty as to whom is responsible for starting it . 
  this was n't the point , though . 
  the point was that russian troops , together with south ossetians , forcibly displaced georgians from the region that did n't agree to accept russian citizenship . 
  and that russia violated a ceasefire agreement from 1992 by still occupying georgian territory with armed forces to this day . 
  regardless of how it started , russia intervened more than it should as a `` peacekeeper '' in the region . 
  this is a generally agreed upon idea . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_south_ossetia  ethnic cleansing of georgians in south ossetia was the removal of georgians , which was conducted in south ossetia and other territories occupied by russian and south ossetian forces , which happened during and after the 2008 russia -- georgia war . 
   people from eastern europe , vietnam and nigeria were the most common victims brought to the uk , mr kerr said .

  meanwhile , there 's also this to consider . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian%e2%80%93ossetian_conflict#events_in_2008  south ossetian separatists committed the first act of violence when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on ** 1 august 2008 ** . 
  the explosion wounded five georgian peacekeepers . 
  in response , georgian snipers assaulted the south ossetian militiamen during the evening . 
  ** ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages on 1 august ** , with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers and other troops in the region . 
   russo-georgian war was started with georgians shelling russian peacekeepers . 
  where 's your proof ? 
  even a russian general contradicts your claims . 
   the company has a long tradition of fraud , arbitrariness and exploitation of workers , say critics . 
   in early 2017 the company once again filed for insolvency . 
  nonetheless , it continues to make a profit , failing to pay workers and using various excuses to mislead , such as a need for sanitation and the `` rationalisation '' of the company , blaming previous management ( from 13 years ago when it was called `` arvanitidis '' ) . 
  it has even tried pinning the company 's poor economic situation on the workers ' unions !, 
   in reality , it is just a sanction on their own population . 
  the government represents the people . 
  if the government makes a decision , it 's in the name of their people . 
  russians elected putin . 
  they support him . 
  putin 's decisions are not his own . 
  they are all responsible and should be sanctioned . 
   you said that russian separatists started the conflict in abkhazia . 
  i 'm arguing against that . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i quoted a wikipedia article . 
   by 1 august 2008 , ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages , with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in the region . 
  the source for that quote is the us library of congress . 
  http://www.loc.gov/law/help/legal-aspects-of-war/russian-georgia-war.php there are also eye-witness reports from 2008 that say the same thing . 
  https://www.rferl.org/a/eyewitness_accounts_confirm_shelling_of_georgian_villages/1349256.html  pro-moscow separatist forces had been shelling his hometown of avnevi , an ethnic-georgian village inside the breakaway region , pretty much nonstop since the beginning of august until georgian troops entered the enclave around midnight on august 7-8 . 
  russian officials even confirmed this . 
   the eyewitness accounts are also consistent with a report , issued on august 5 , by a tripartite monitoring group , which included organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) military observers and representatives of russian peacekeeping forces in the region . 
   the report , signed by the commander of russian peacekeepers in the region , general marat kulakhmetov , said there was evidence of attacks against several ethnic-georgian villages in south ossetia . 
  the report also claims that south ossetian separatists were using heavy weapons against the georgian villages , which was prohibited by a 1992 cease-fire agreement . 
  pro-moscow separatist forces violated a 1992 cease-fire agreement and began shelling georgian villages . 
  that 's how the russo-georgian war of 2008 started . 
   the numbers you quoted 10 times are refering to the 92-93 war and what happened shortly afterwards . 
  the 2008 cleansing happened . 
  the numbers i quoted earlier were from the 1990s cleansing . 
  that was my mistake . 
  read the [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_south_ossetia ) . 
   ethnic cleansing of georgians in south ossetia was the removal of georgians , which was conducted in south ossetia and other territories occupied by russian and south ossetian forces , which happened during and after the ** 2008 ** russia -- georgia war . 
   according to the september 2009 report of the european union-sponsored independent international fact-finding mission on the conflict in georgia , `` several elements suggest the conclusion that ethnic cleansing was carried out against ethnic georgians in south ossetia both during and after the august ** 2008 ** conflict .
