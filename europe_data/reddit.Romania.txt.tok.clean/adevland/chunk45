  hundreds of homicides go ignored each year because they are `` single incidents '' and have `` no real motive '' . 
  that 's hundreds of preventable deaths you 're ignoring while focusing on other `` single events '' because they 're meant to capture your attention . 
  terrorists win when they get your attention and make you feel fear and hatred towards muslims . 
  that 's how they spread their cause and gain recruits . 
   or against them read the article . 
   ** a group of muslims ** had earlier performed tarawih , night time prayers held in the month of ramadan , when they came across a collapsed man at a bus stop . 
  ** while rendering first aid they were rammed , and ten were injured ** . 
   you know why it 's ok to ignore that guy ? 
  because it 's a single incident . 
  thanks for proving my point .

  ** i 'm not saying that you should ignore them . 
  i 'm saying that you should n't fear and hate people because of their religion . 
  terrorists are radicals . 
  they do n't preach nor practice traditional islam . 
  by hating all muslims , they win . 
   great whataboutism , would you like to defend the nazis next ? 
  you 're trying to swing it to nazis but i 'm the one doing whataboutism ? 
  great logic , bro . 
  keep ignoring the crimes that do n't fit your agenda . 
   one person killed by a car . 
  by your logic that is hit and run . 
  one person killed and 10 hurt while giving that person first aid . 
  the motive makes it a terror attack . 
  the motives makes it easier to ignore other , more gruesome crimes , because they are n't classified as terror attacks . 
  it 's easier to ignore hundreds of gun crimes that happen each year because they do n't get coverage . 
  terrorists win when you focus all of your attention on one terror attack . 
   there is a difference between a murder and a mass murder . 
  yeah . 
  it 's called reading the news . 
  it 's easier to focus all of your hatred towards one article about 5 people being hurt in a car attack than focusing on hundreds of individual gun related murders that happen each year . 
   the real problem is the west sticking its nose in the affairs of middle eastern countries . 
  then people flee from the middle east to the west because the west fucked up their countries , or helped in fucking up their countries . 
  i agree . 
  but it 's not something you can fix . 
  gun homicides is something you can fix . 
   that does n't mean that all muslims are terrorists , but all terrorists are muslims . 
  not all terrorists are muslims . 
  most of them are , but not all . 
  9/11 aside , right wing terror attacks are pretty close in terms of casualties . 
  but it 's not a dick measuring contest . 
  terrorism is a problem , but people blow it out of proportion and things lead to more violence from right wing extremists . 
  this does n't help anyone . 
   i 'm justified in my fear of getting hit by a religion of peace truck this is a common misconception . 
  radical islam terrorists are just that , radicals . 
  they do n't preach classic islam but extremist interpretations of it . 
  all religions have extremist interpretations . 
  before the iranian revolution from the 1970s , things were quite different with the middle east actually opening up towards western culture . 
  then radicals took over and shit started hitting the fan . 
   when you declare guns illegal , only the bad guys can get them . 
  strict regulation and control can minimize that . 
  bad guys can get them only if they are on the market . 
  smuggling ca n't arm an army of bad guys . 
   in the uk there were 213 homicides using a sharp instrument in 2015/16 , accounting for 37 % of all homicides . 
  you do n't need guns to make a sandwich . 
  gun homicides is a problem you can fix . 
  sharp instrument crimes and other crimes like acid attacks can only be prevented if properly sanctioned . 
  the penalties for these crimes are very low in the uk , that 's why they are so common . 
  there 's literally no penalty for acid attacks in the uk . 
  regulate the substances and apply harsh penalties for misuse . 
   why do n't you want to ban knives since more people die because of them ? 
  what fucking logic do you use ? 
  you ca n't ban knives but you can ban guns because you do n't need guns to make a sandwich . 
  gun homicides is a problem you can solve . 
  knife homicides is a problem you can solve by having harsh penalties . 
   you do n't give a shit about the people dying you just want to spread your propaganda . 
  dude , that was exactly my point . 
  you 're peddling mindless xenophobia when you 're getting killed by your own people by knives . 
  brits are killing the most brits and they 're doing it with knives . 
  meanwhile , you 're focusing all of your attention on terrorist attacks and vilify all muslims . 
  this wo n't stop brits from killing brits with knives . 
  the little green guy was right . 
   yeah , they just stood and watched . 
  why do you think there 's pretty much no more serbs in kosovo ? 
  so , they stood and watched and by doing that there are no more serbs in kosovo ? 
   what local government ? 
  if kosovo is allowed to have foreign troops on their soil , why not abkhazia and south ossetia ? 
  nato did n't violate their agreements . 
  nato did n't forcefully displace citizens . 
  russia violated the ceasefire agreement by still occupying georgian territories with russian troops . 
  russia announced that the region would be absorbed into russia . 
  nato did n't absorb anything . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia#integration_with_russia  on august 30 , 2008 , tarzan kokoity , the deputy speaker of south ossetia 's parliament , announced that the region would soon be absorbed into russia , so that south and north ossetians could live together in one united russian state . 
  russian and south ossetian forces began giving residents in akhalgori , the biggest town in the predominantly ethnic georgian eastern part of south ossetia , the choice of accepting russian citizenship or leaving . 
   russian separatists started a conflict in abkhazia ? 
  are you feeling well , mate ?

   what 's your point ? 
  that one of the previous ones was done by anti-muslim reactionaries ? 
  ok , sure . 
  how does that help us ? 
  the point is you 're blaming muslims without any evidence even though a previous attack was made by a white man and not by a muslim . 
   are you implying that we should n't talk about terrorist attacks because they incentivise terrorist attacks ? 
  talking about them and blaming muslims without evidence are two different things . 
  talk about them , but do n't jump to conclusions . 
  do n't be prejudiced .
