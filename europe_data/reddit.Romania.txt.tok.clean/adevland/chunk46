   are you implying that the person you 're responding to is biased ? 
  because that may be true in some of the other places you 've copy-pasted your comment , but it does n't seem obvious here , and it 's generally better to assume the benefit of the doubt before making this kind of low-effort posts . 
  the benefit of the doubt is the point here . 
  people in this thread are jumping to conclusions and pointing blame to muslims without having any evidence and they 're doing this less than 2 months after a white man did the same crime . 
  they completely ignored that incident even though it happened less than 2 months ago . 
   because abkhazians does n't want to live with georgians so russia invaded georgia and occupied their territories . 
  makes sense . 
   what would happen if transylvania would have an autonomy vote ? 
  the government would just say it 's illegal and that 's it . 
  more whataboutism . 
  hungarians in romania have always been a minority , even in transylvania . 
   according to the results of the 2011 population census , the total population of transylvania was 6.789.250 inhabitants and the ethnic groups were : romanians - 70.62 % , hungarians - 17.92 % , roma - 3.99 % , ukrainians - 0.63 % , germans - 0.49 % , other - 0.77 % . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania#population over 70 % are romanians . 
   you 're talking out of your ass , man . 
  i 'm quoting an article that you yourself mentioned . 
   jesus , just read a freaking article about it . 
  i did . 
  i quoted from a wikipedia article that you mentioned . 
  did you even read it ? 
  you 're making wild claims without any proof to support them while the very articles that you mentioned contradict you . 
  you 're doing nothing but trolling at this point . 
  i will no longer be responding to you on this topic no matter how many will accusations you 're making . 
  have a nice day . 
   i have no bread , but i can offer some more circus because that 's the only way i can hold onto power . 
   it does n't matter at all that the people living there do n't consider it georgian territory . 
  the people living there can declare independence and ask for international recognition via peaceful means . 
  this did n't happen . 
  ** these were russian separatists that literally destroyed villages and displaced locals by force . 
  ** below from the wikipedia article you mentioned [ earlier ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6sk2qf/putin_heads_to_occupied_georgia_territory_on_war/dldfdvt/ ) . 
   the south ossetians destroyed most ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of georgians . 
   the population of abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of georgians , a decrease from 525,000 before the war . 
   and youre ignoring the even bigger problem of people killed in automobile accidents accidents are not homicides just like how gun related suicides are not homicides . 
   see ? 
  i can be an idiot too . 
  thanks for insulting me . 
  this discussion is over . 
   hundreds killed by islamic terrorists over the last year . 
  one example of a guy killed for being muslim posted over and over . 
  ** whats a bigger problem , seriously ? 
  ** what 's a bigger problem ? 
  http://www.vlaamsvredesinstituut.eu/sites/vlaamsvredesinstituut.eu/files/files/reports/firearms_and_violent_deaths_in_europe_web.pdf 15 % of all homicides in the uk are gun related . 
  an average of 38.3 people are murdered each year in the uk via guns . 
  in italy , that number is even bigger . 
  an average of 250.4 people are killed yearly by guns which amounts to 45 % of all homicides . 
  about 10 000 people are killed each year by guns in the us . 
   in 2010 , 67 % of all homicides in the u.s. were committed using a firearm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_violence_in_the_united_states ** guns are a way bigger problem than terrorism , but people , somehow , choose to ignore it and focus only on terrorism . 
  ** that 's the whole purpose of terrorism . 
  to attract attention and generate fear and hate . 
  you 're actually playing their game by having unjustified fear and hatred towards all muslims . 
  that 's exactly what terrorists want . 
  that 's how they get more support to their cause , by pointing their fingers at you for hating all muslims . 
   nato destroyed yugoslavia , it was all done because the us imperialists wanted military bases in the balkans . 
  nothing else to it . 
  i like how you make wild claims and accusations but lack even the slightest shred of proof or argument . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm right because i say so . 
  this discussion is over . 
   cuz thats the real problem , not hundreds of people being run over over the last few years in the name of islam the real problem ?

   both sides use to push their own agenda of taking over some territory ? 
  georgia did n't try to take over georgia 's territory because it 's already their territory . 
   i 'm not trying to discuss who 's right or wrong or whatever , this is a zone that is very , very important geopolitically . 
  at this point you 're just debating semantics by saying silly things like how georgia tried to take over its own territory . 
  this discussion is over . 
   no i dont give a fuck about gun violence in either of those countries  i do care about jihadis using vehicles as weapons , thats why im here you just admitted to having a biased agenda and to actively ignoring bigger problems than terrorism because you `` do n't give a fuck '' . 
   no , russia has not officially annexed abkhazia . 
  abkhazia is not officially part of the russian federation . 
  you 're debating semantics . 
  russia invaded a foreign country , after russian separatists started a conflict there , and are still occupying it in violation of the ceasefire agreement . 
   the us has a bigger military prescense in the stolen serbian territory of kosovo which nato stole by attacking and killing hundreds of serbian civilians great whataboutism tactic you got there . 
  hey , guys !, 
  ignore what the russians did and look at what the us did !, 
  / s which nato stole ? 
  nato is n't a country . 
  it was part of yugoslavia which tore itself apart in the 1990s before the kosovo war started . 
  us army bases in kosovo are under nato command . 
   the kosovo force ( kfor ) is a nato-led international peacekeeping force which was responsible for establishing a secure environment in kosovo . 
   kfor has gradually transferred responsibilities to the kosovo police and other local authorities . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_force russia is n't transferring anything to the local authorities . 
  they are the local authorities in abkhazia and south ossetia . 
  they are in direct violation of the ceasefire agreement of august 2008 . 
   because some people have brains and can recognize patterns ? 
  because some people have prejudice and do not recognize it even when it 's pointed out to them . 
  i already pointed out an example of a car attack from less than 2 months ago when muslims were the victims and the perpetrator was a white male . 
  people literally ignore it and call it spam because it does n't suit their agenda . 
   russia unlike crimea has never annexed abkhazia . 
  it has military bases there just as the us has in kosovo . 
  this is false . 
   russian forces temporarily occupied the georgian cities of zugdidi , senaki , poti , and gori , holding on to these areas beyond the ceasefire .
