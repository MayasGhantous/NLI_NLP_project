   russia has , since the war , occupied abkhazia and south ossetia in violation of the ceasefire agreement of august 2008 . 
   i wish all my arguments could be solved by spamming one link en masse . 
  calling it spam is a great way to ignore it . 
   the us has one of the biggest bases in the world in kosovo for a reason as well . 
  yeah , but they did n't effectively annex the territory and they did n't start an ethnic cleansing campaign against the locals . 
   the population of abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of georgians , a decrease from 525,000 before the war . 
   not sure what game we 're playing ? 
  the game where we pretend that war did n't happen ? 
  because that 's stupid . 
  you 're laying the game of `` georgia tried to take back '' , which never actually happened . 
   by 1 august 2008 , ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages , with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in the region . 
  to put an end to these deadly attacks and restore order , the georgian army was sent to the south ossetian conflict zone on 7 august . 
  georgians took control of most of tskhinvali , a separatist stronghold , in hours . 
  georgia later stated it was also responding to russia moving non-peacekeeping units into the country . 
  tskhinvali was and still is georgian territory . 
  georgia responded to russian separatists that attacked georgian villages . 
  that 's how the war started . 
   russia accused georgia of `` aggression against south ossetia '' , while ignoring how their own separatists started the conflict in the first place  and launched a large-scale land , air and sea invasion of georgia on 8 august with the stated aim of `` peace enforcement '' operation . 
  even though their aim was `` peace enforcement '' , russia effectively annexed 20 % of georgian territory . 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
   russian forces temporarily occupied the georgian cities of zugdidi , senaki , poti , and gori , holding on to these areas beyond the ceasefire . 
  the south ossetians destroyed most ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of georgians . 
  russia recognised the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia from georgia on 26 august  the population of abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of georgians , a decrease from 525,000 before the war . 
  ethnic cleansing ? 
  is just `` peace enforcement '' . 
  / s [ ethnic cleansing of georgians in abkhazia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_abkhazia ), 
   i dont live in any of those countries so you do n't care about gun violence in those countries , but you 're complaining about incidents that happen in those countries that you believe involve muslims , even though there 's still no proof . 
  that 's a double standard , bro . 
  you 're cherry picking your arguments while ignoring everything else that does n't suit your agenda . 
   i think this post is being brigaded right now . 
  the whole of / r/europe is being brigaded with hate and xenophobia . 
  when you confront them with facts and official statistics , they down-vote and stop responding in the hopes that nobody will notice . 
   because georgia tried to take it back ? 
  did they ? 
  i do n't recall any georgian military operation that tried to do this . 
  and even if they did , it 's still their territory . 
  what actually happened was  in 2009 , georgian president mikheil saakashvili mentioned in several addresses the fact that russia was staying 40 kilometers away from georgia 's capital , tbilisi , and aimed weapons at it . 
  and  in march 2011 , the russians demanded village aibga , situated on the psou river in the northwest part of abkhazia , to be transferred to russia .

   well it was a few weeks since the last one . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_finsbury_park_attack  on 19 june 2017 , a van was driven into pedestrians in finsbury park , london , injuring at least eight people . 
  this occurred near the muslim welfare house , 100 yards ( 90 m ) from finsbury park mosque . 
  a man who had earlier collapsed and was receiving first aid died at the scene . 
   a group of muslims had earlier performed tarawih , night time prayers held in the month of ramadan , when they came across a collapsed man at a bus stop . 
  ** while rendering first aid they were rammed , and ten were injured . 
  ** the collapsed man , makram ali , died at the scene , and post-mortem findings indicated that he died of multiple injuries . 
   russia , naturally , saw putin 's abkhazian visit -- his first in four years -- somewhat differently . 
  `` the most important thing is that we have very special relations with abkhazia . 
  we safeguard the security and independence of abkhazia . 
  i am confident this will continue into the future , '' putin said . 
  he also noted that the russian military group deployed there is `` developing well . '' why is russia safeguarding `` the security and independence of abkhazia '' ? 
  because  the russian military group deployed there is `` developing well . '', 
  fear and ignorance happens . 
  and fear leads to hate which leads to violence . 
   hit and runs are usually accidents except when they are n't . 
   and in many cases the drivers are unknown just like in this case . 
   theres are coverup of widespread antiislamic hit and runs and yet people still blame muslims . 
   theres like 30 times more `` white people '' than muslims and yet probably at least that many times more muslim attackers than vice versa . 
  the disparity is even greater comparing body counts . 
  ** does it make you feel better knowing that you 're more likely to be killed by a bullet shot by `` one of your own '' than by a terrorist ?

   how many times more you will plaster this one incident in this thread ? 
  this `` one '' incident ? 
  hey , guys . 
  it only happened once . 
  it 's ok to ignore that guy that killed those muslims that were giving first aid to another person . 
   nope , but 9 out of 10 are it 's not a dick measuring contest . 
  and even if it were , gun homicides are a way bigger problem .

  what 's the difference between being randomly killed by a `` lone wolf '' deranged sniper in a mall and being blown up by terrorist ? 
  does it make you feel better that `` lone wolfs '' have no beliefs ? 
  does it make you feel better that you 're more likely to be killed by a bullet shot by `` one of your own '' ? 
   there 's always somebody who avoids the bigger , more obvious problem because it makes them feel uncomfortable . 
  xenophobia is a huge problem . 
  placing blame before knowing all the facts is nothing but pure prejudice . 
  and this is becoming a big problem which people choose to ignore because it makes them feel guilty and uncomfortable . 
   immediately go to the one time a white man has used a vehicle to attack muslims that were giving first aid to another man who died because of the attack . 
  it happened just once . 
  it 's ok to ignore it , right ? 
  / s [ one dead and 22 injured as car rams into pedestrians in times square ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/nyregion/times-square-crash.html )  the driver of the honda , richard rojas , 26 , a navy veteran from the bronx , had a history of arrests for drunken driving , said officials , moving quickly to assuage fears of terrorism . 
   `` based on information we have at this moment , there is no indication that this was an act of terrorism , '' mayor bill de blasio told reporters at a news conference near the scene of the rampage . 
  it 's ok to ignore it because it was n't an act of terrorism , right ? 
  the guy was high so he clearly did n't mean to mow down all those people . 
  / s  it was around noon when mr. rojas swerved onto a curb near 42nd street and then accelerated north along the sidewalk on seventh avenue , which runs one way , southbound -- ** crashing into people for block after block ** . 
  it 's ok because he was high . 
  he did n't mean to keep driving after hitting so many people . 
  the drugs made him do it .
