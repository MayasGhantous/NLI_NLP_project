  / s ** had it been a muslim driving the car while being high , it would have been instantly called a terror attack . 
   are you just spamming the one recent terror attack using a car that was n't islamic on all the threads about this ? 
  are you just spamming the same xenophobic rhetoric that people spammed back then , even though they did n't know who was responsible for the attack ? 
  people need to remember that these things are not committed only by muslims . 
  back then some guy , who was n't muslim nor an immigrant , drove a car into a group of muslims that were giving first aid to another man . 
  you somehow choose to ignore this . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
   a hit and run is n't a premeditated assault on people of a specific race/ideology . 
  you 're debating semantics . 
  some of them are exactly how you described them . 
  people running into other people with a motor vehicle because that 's exactly what they planned to do . 
  assuming that all of them are terror attacks is bad and assuming that all of them are committed by muslims is prejudice . 
  remember this ? 
  it 's from 19 june 2017 . 
  that 's less than 2 months ago . 
  people were saying the same xenophobic rants back then as they do now . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_finsbury_park_attack  a group of muslims had earlier performed tarawih , night time prayers held in the month of ramadan , when they came across a collapsed man at a bus stop . 
  ** while rendering first aid they were rammed , and ten were injured . 
  ** the collapsed man , makram ali , died at the scene , and post-mortem findings indicated that he died of multiple injuries .

   thats weird . 
  its not happening here and we have cars too . 
  yes , it is happening . 
  it 's called a hit and run . 
  the difference is that you do n't consider every hit and run to be a terrorist attack and you do n't spread blame before actually knowing who 's responsible for the crime . 
  what is `` this '' ? 
  people being violent towards other people ? 
  `` this '' has always been happening . 
  the only difference now is that people know who to blame before they actually know who 's responsible . 
   but romania does n't have a renault of healthcare , romania has a horse drawn carriage driven by a corrupt driver . 
  the carriage would work far better is the driver was n't corrupt . 
   so what did romanian doctors choose between grinding in a system that is severely underfunded and going to the west ? 
  you keep pointing out the fact that the system sucks . 
  it does . 
  but the problem is n't just money . 
  it 's corruption . 
  you ca n't just throw money at the system and hope that it will get better because most of that money will go missing as it does today . 
  ** you do n't fix a stab wound by putting a 5000 $ band-aid on it . 
  ** for the system to work better , corruption has to be eradicated from the administration , not just from the doctor ranks . 
  then , and only then , can you start putting more money in the system because , otherwise , that money will just be embezzled . 
   are they really ? 
  throwing money at a problem does n't automatically fix it . 
  the us spends the most on healthcare but also has the highest prices . 
  you 're not supposed to ignore the price . 
  if you spend 10 times more but the prices are also 10 times higher , then you do n't get better healthcare . 
  [ u.s. spends more on health care than other high-income nations but has lower life expectancy , worse health ] ( http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/oct/us-spends-more-on-health-care-than-other-nations ) it 's not just about money . 
  it 's what you do with that money . 
  you can do a lot with very little , if you 're driven to do it . 
  when you spend 10 times the market average to bulk acquire syringes for a hospital , then you 've done a shitty job at managing hospital funds . 
  if you take that money and use it to build a house for yourself , then that 's corruption . 
  both of these things are happening in romania . 
  healthcare would be much better if these things did not happen . 
   in addition , christian lidner has so far proposed to forget about the annexation of the crimea and switch to the development of german-russian relations , which have worsened since the beginning of the ukrainian crisis . 
  nice try , putin . 
  corruption is still present , but less than before . 
  you rarely encounter medics who even hint at a bribe . 
  most of them take this seriously and deny even basic gifts they may receive from the elderly that were indoctrinated to do this during communism . 
  the problem is that the system is mismanaged . 
  the funds are there , but the money is either embezzled directly via fake documents or via overpriced acquisitions . 
  and this is so because the ruling party is corrupt and they are the ones who appoint hospital managers . 
  there was an attempt to change this process and to hire hospital managers via open contests , but it got rejected by the ruling party . 
  there are huge scandals regarding some hospital directors who literally stole money from the hospital for their own gain . 
  huge amounts . 
  and all of this while people were being treated in bad conditions in the hospital . 
  [ hospital manager in romania arrested for bribery and embezzlement after journalistic investigation ] ( https://www.romania-insider.com/hospital-manager-romania-arrested-bribery-embezzlement-journalistic-investigation/ ), 
   as an eu national , you can freely travel with your cat , dog or ferret if it has a european pet passport . 
  this passport is available from any authorised veterinarian and must contain details of a valid anti-rabies vaccination . 
  this is only one guy from the top getting the can . 
  the company itself was finned while restrictions on their car sales were applied . 
  similar actions are being taken in europe . 
  this is yours . 
  everything else is russi ** ass ** . 
   if they want to remain they should continue to make their voices heard . 
  i agree . 
  but remaining wo n't silence the other side , it will make them even more vocal . 
  inb4 : the eu is forcing the uk to stay !, 
  we have no autonomy !, 
  we were right all along !, 
  / s at this point there is no other way to go but forward . 
   he 's got some weird crab-in-the-bucket mentality that britain deserves to be in economic ruin or some shit this is not true . 
  i never said i wished anyone any harm . 
  the point is that this whole thing can be and is very educational because people do n't listen otherwise . 
  it 's making the best out of a bad situation . 
  nobody forced the uk into this situation . 
  the majority chose to believe tabloid propaganda instead of expert opinions and they voted for it to happen . 
  it was a stupid decision and history will remember it . 
  ** it 's not a bad thing to remember and learn from history . 
   waiting for pis fans to defend this move ... [ crickets in background ] they 'll have to get really creative with this one .
