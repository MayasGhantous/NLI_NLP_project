  they 'll probably ignore it or blame soros . 
  [ nils holgerson intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swrckqgdn4m ), 
   that backlash is n't going to go away though . 
  people will blame the eu if they do n't get a hard brexit some people will continue to blame the eu regardless of what happens . 
  you just have to accept that some people simply can not form an unbiased opinion and that they will always believe the opinion of others that they randomly deem trustworthy . 
  you can educate most people to have an objective opinion , but not all . 
   from my pov , hard brexit is one of the worst possible scenarios yep . 
  nobody wants that . 
  it probably wo n't happen . 
   i take it you have german ancestry ? 
  not as far as i know . 
  i 'm just being curious as to why this video is considered `` moving '' . 
  i think that the [ nils holgerson intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swrckqgdn4m ) is more moving than this . 
  we had those cartoons in romania when i was little . 
   because alfred j. kwak was killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks is this a joke ? 
  i ca n't find any reference of this anywhere . 
  [ alfred j. kwak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_j._kwak ) appears to be a fictional duck character . 
   nothing , it was a joke . 
  we 're now back to the original question that asks how and why this clip is considered to be `` moving '' . 
   i 'd rather not have the economy damaged and peoples ' lives ruined to ` teach a lesson ' , thanks all the same . 
  me too . 
  but the majority in the uk disagrees and will probably only get even more vocal if they do n't have their way . 
  imagine the backlash if the brexit vote is ignored . 
  inb4 : the eu is forcing the uk to stay . 
  we have no autonomy . 
  we were right all along . 
   well in the first episode alfred 's entire family gets killed by a car while they try to cross the road . 
  what does this have to do with 9/11 ? 
   vote and hope for a miracle . 
  and do your best to educate others that voting is important and that every vote counts . 
  do n't tell them what to think or who to vote for . 
  show them the facts and let them reach a conclusion on their own . 
   people should n't be forced to endure others ignorance . 
  i agree . 
  but , what can you do if the majority thinks the exact opposite of what you do ? 
   alfred j. kwak was killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks . 
  is this a joke ? 
  i ca n't find any reference of this anywhere . 
  alfred j. kwak appears to be a fictional duck character . 
   what about people who voted remain ? 
  or are we just collateral damage ? 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  you ca n't please everyone . 
  the majority voted to leave . 
  it sucks because it was such a tight margin , but that 's how things work . 
  :| the same thing has been happening in romania for the past 27 years . 
  the ruling party sucks but it 's nearly impossible to beat them in the vote because they always make outlandish promises and the poor and stupid people always vote for them while also complaining about them . 
  they are corrupt and steal like there 's no tomorrow . 
  meanwhile , more than half of the people , that could have voted , did n't , but they still complain that the country sucks and that there is no change . 
  if you want change , if you have to vote for it . 
  `` but the other guys are n't perfect ! '', 
  is the most common complaint and reasoning behind those that do not vote , even though `` the other guys '' are n't corrupt and have no prior convictions . 
  sadly , the only way of teaching these people a lesson is to let them have their way and have them live through the consequences of their actions while also being mocked and criticized by those that did vote for change . 
  the `` twitch plays '' experiments have showed us that these things have the potential to go horrifically wrong . 
  people will find ways to abuse the bots and it 's only a matter of time until the whole thing crashes and burns if it 's directly exposed to the public . 
   the bridge has been closed to heavy goods vehicles since 2012 , when cracks were discovered in the concrete . 
  ** a replacement will be opened in 2020 . 
  ** but until then , lorries will have to find other ways across the rhine . 
  guys !, 
  do n't look at the new bridge that they are building !, 
  look at this old one that has cracks in it !, 
   statistics show that public investment as a percentage of gross domestic product fell from nearly 5 per cent in 1970 to an all-time low of 1.9 per cent in 2005 . 
  it has stabilised at about 2 per cent . 
  the government insists public investment is `` surging '' , with an average annual growth rate of 3.8 per cent , and will increase by about 5 per cent a year until 2020 . 
  guys !, 
  do n't look at the present and future . 
  look at all-time low from 12 years ago and ignore the growth in public investment !, 
  seriously , this is the best article i 've ever read . 
  it contradicts itself at every turn and has cherry picking material for everybody . 
  do you hate merkel and her government ? 
  we got you , fam !, 
  do you love merkel and her government ? 
  we got you , too , fam !, 
  everyone is happy . 
  yay !, 
  it would n't do anyone any good . 
  those that voted to leave would still be sour that the eu wo n't give them autonomy while also stating that the eu is n't doing enough to help them , even though these are 2 conflicting ideas . 
  the best course of action is to let it happen and teach everyone a lesson in practical stupidity . 
  because being warned by experts was n't enough and because they voted for it . 
  bretain !, 
   but now we have audio and picture proof . 
  those are criminals not helpers . 
  even the italian government admits that they only have circumstantial evidence . 
   `` inquiries begun in october 2016 , and conducted with the use of sophisticated techniques and investigative technology , have produced ** circumstantial evidence ** of the motorboat iuventa being used for activities facilitating illegal immigration , '' a statement said . 
   we all today indirectly benefit from the violence , rape , theft , and slavery of our ancestors . 
  unless you 're the descendant of those that were the victims of rape , theft and slavery . 
  the us , especially , still has a big problem with racism and african-american people still get treated unfairly in many situations . 
   lol no tl ; dr : you 're wrong because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
  all americans , expect for the native ones which are almost extinct , are immigrants or descendants of immigrants . 
   what ? 
  even your own quote agrees with me . . or are you illiterate ? 
  you clearly do n't know what ** circumstantial evidence ** means . 
  it means they have no direct proof . 
   circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact -- like a fingerprint at the scene of a crime . 
  by contrast , direct evidence supports the truth of an assertion directly -- i.e. , without need for any additional evidence or inference . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumstantial_evidence if your fingerprints are found at a crime scene , it does n't mean that you committed the crime . 
  my argument is that they have no direct evidence . 
  these are not proven crimes . 
  the article we 're discussing even says this .
