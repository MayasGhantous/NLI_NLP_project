   italian police and coast guard authorities on wednesday executed an order by a trapani judge for the preventative seizure of the iuventa , a ship flying the dutch flag operating for the german ngo jugend rettet , sources said . 
  the order is related to a probe into ** alleged aiding of illegal immigration ** . 
  ** these are all just unproven allegations based on circumstantial evidence . 
  ** if you ca n't make the distinction between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence , then that 's your problem , and it only proves that you 're being intentionally ignorant because the facts do not support your claims . 
   you 're unable to make a single argument to challenge what i said [ i already did this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6r53ev/ngo_ship_conducting_migrant_rescues_iuventa/dl3sars/ ) but you ignored it because it contradicts your narrative . 
  here it is again . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/02/italy-impounds-ngo-rescue-ship-sends-navy-patrol-boat-to-libya-migrant-refugee-route-europe  `` inquiries begun in october 2016 , and conducted with the use of sophisticated techniques and investigative technology , have produced circumstantial evidence of the motorboat iuventa being used for activities facilitating illegal immigration , '' a statement said . 
  they have no direct evidence , yet people here jump on the ngo hate bandwagon because they hate immigrants . 
   i give you some time read and understand what i wrote in this thread so you can form an actual argument my argument is that you have no proof . 
  i asked you for proof but you presented none . 
  now you 're trying to move the goal post by asking me for an argument while i did n't even make any claims to argument about . 
  either you come up with hard proof for your claims , or this discussion is over . 
  ** all people are innocent until proven guilty . 
   so are you going to make an actual argument ? 
  you made claims without proving them . 
  i just pointed out your lack of evidence . 
  am i supposed to prove your claims ? 
  that 's your job , not mine . 
   `` inquiries begun in october 2016 , and conducted with the use of sophisticated techniques and investigative technology , have produced ** circumstantial evidence ** of the motorboat iuventa being used for activities facilitating illegal immigration , '' a statement said . 
  people here are quick to jump on the ngo hate band-wagon . 
   so far you all you did was attempting to make some shitty jokes . 
  so , when you say `` they are scum '' , you 're joking , right ? 
  because your `` explanation '' is completely void of proof and extremely vague . 
  we 're literally supposed to take your word for it . 
   it 's also a crime against the european people and especially italy who are left with hundreds of thousands of uneducated immigrants and they now have to pay for their food and housing . 
   so yes they are absolute scum so , they are `` scum '' because you buy hungry people food ? 
   on top of that human trafficking is a pretty serious crime ... 
  it 's also an unproven crime . 
  all of the evidence presented so far is circumstantial at best . 
  you 're accusing people of a crime without having proof . 
  below from another article floating around here .

  they have no direct evidence , yet people here jump on the ngo hate bandwagon because they hate immigrants . 
   i fully understand the issue , that 's how i know they are scum . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm right because i say so . 
  great logic . 
  https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/eu-policy_en those are the rules that must be respected in order to obtain the eu organic certification . 
   to prevent the development of pests , diseases and weeds , organic farmers are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides or herbicides . 
   it 's way more complex than that so we 'll just call them `` absolute scum '' because we do n't fully understand the issue and it 's easier to deal with it that way .

   in cognitive science , [ choice-supportive bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/choice-supportive_bias ) or post-purchase rationalization is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected . 
  it is a cognitive bias . 
  for example , if a person chooses option a instead of option b , they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option a while amplifying those of option b. conversely , they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option a and not notice or de-emphasize those of option b. 
   dude you are just delusional trying to cause moral panic about muh pedophiles stealin muh kids you said that tor can not have ads and have been proved wrong . 
  you 're now moving the goal post and resorting to mocking me in all caps . 
  you 've hit the bottom of the barrel . 
   dude you are talking out of your fucking ass , ads do n't get run on illegal . onion sites insulting me does n't make you right . 
  [ grams grows with torads : first advertising network for tor ] ( https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/18/grams-torads/ ), 
   and who is hurt by that ? 
  creating child pornography means abusing children . 
  if they can model them without actually using children models and if the whole thing is regulated , then , yes , it could help . 
   would men be more likely to rape women if they had very realistic sex dolls ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is that , in order to make these realistic dolls , models are required . 
  adult women porn stars offer do this . 
  are there any child porn stars ? 
  do you see my point ? 
  yep . 
  but one feeds the other . 
   they need to try deportations or imprisonment for life . 
  the eu is already deporting those that have been rejected refugee status . 
  [ germany aims to deport record number of rejected asylum seekers in 2017 ] ( http://fortune.com/2017/02/19/germany-deports-asylum-seekers/ ) [ france to boost refugee aid , deport economic migrants ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/france-to-boost-refugee-aid-deport-economic-migrants/ ) not knowing about something does n't mean that it does n't happen . 
  ignorance is a poor excuse for stupidity . 
  tl ; dr : the immigrants are to blame . 
  kudos for bringing immigrants into a child sex doll article discussion , though . 
  that takes some serious mental gymnastics to accomplish . 
   why are you so apologetic of your government ? 
  i 'm not french . 
   yes the people do n't know what to do , then they elect officials who are supposed to know . 
  they 're also people . 
  they 're not super-heroes . 
  if normal people ca n't figure it out , then the government is most likely going to trial and error it because there is no other precedent . 
   one should be critical of their government and be loud about their failures . 
  the government admitted the failure . 
  the center was a pilot program that was closed after a few months . 
  they tried the idea , saw that it did n't work , then moved on . 
  why are n't you moving on ? 
  what more do you want ? 
  do you really expect this kind of problem to get solved over night on the first attempt ? 
   but france will try anything but deportation .

   if you 're profiting off ads on an onion domain , someone is doing something massively wrong . 
  google ads is n't the only option . 
  before google ads , under the table deals were common and custom banners were the norm . 
  as long as the production is regulated , then it could work . 
   do we know that ? 
  if you make it legal , more of it will be produced and children get abused when making child pornography . 
   for one , child porn to my knowledge is n't necessarily paid content . 
  there 's a lot of free mature porn that is profitable via ads . 
  it 's also not just about the money . 
  it 's about the notoriety . 
  this stuff is shared on the dark corners of the web . 
  if it gets popular/profitable , more of it will be produced and that 's how children get abused . 
  that 's why it 's illegal . 
  i would n't be surprised if he did . 
   the french government is the one who allowed/still allows for radicals to grow in france in the first place , and this attempt at de-radicalization is coming out of french peoples ' pockets . 
  so , the government is n't doing anything , and , when it does , you 're upset that they do it with tax money ? 
  in what scenario are n't you upset ?
