  i was talking about freedom of movement in the broader sense . 
  see the ceta examples which has various limitations on the stay and duration . 
  and you were talking about the specific way in which the eu implemented it within itself . 
  i 'm glad we finally clarified this . 
   get lost you loser i do n't have time for fools . 
  you ca n't prove your point so you resort to insults . 
   i only used romania as an example to try to get you to understand the absurdity of thinking that uk - eu travel will require visa after brexit . 
  the fact is that we do n't know what will happen . 
  if visa-free travel is agreed upon by both sides and if it 's reciprocated , then it 's ok .  i 'm not trying to disrespect you , it 's simply to make you think about the scale of the problem of implementing visa after brexit . 
  that was my point as well . 
  brexit is a complicated issue and the time frame is short . 
  and this is worrisome . 
   no because the whole world says so , and that 's why you 've been downvoted so often in this thread . 
  without proof that 's still just you saying so . 
  down-votes are not proof , bro . 
   no we ca n't , because freedom of movement is an eu defined right under eu law and that concept is valid only for eu countries because eu law applies only to them . 
  are you saying that only eu countries benefit from freedom of movement ? 
  are you saying that the eu invented the concept ? 
  this is blatantly false . 
  freedom of movement exists outside of the eu . 
   as i said . 
  the us , uk , japan , australia etc. 
  all have visa waiver programmes , yet nobody would describe it as `` freedom of movement '' . 
  because it 's often limited as described in the wikipedia article . 
   the eu-canada economic and trade agreement ( [ ceta ] ( http://europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/ceta-and-global-governance-law-what-kind-of-model-agreement-is-it-really-in-law ) ) provides for the ** free movement ** of goods , persons and capital ** to various degrees ** . 
  ... ... ... ... ... ... .  look . 
  i 'm sorry if i was insulting , i 'm just getting frustrated going round and round in circles in this argument with you when the answer is so damn obvious to most of us in this thread . 
  it 's ok . you should n't be frustrated when people ask you to prove the things that you are saying . 
   yes , because of aviation regulation and increased air fare costs . 
  not because of visas . 
  read the whole article . 
   it also comes in 108th place for visa requirements , something that is likely to fall once britain has left the eu , and opted out from the eu 's free movement policy . 
  there is way less tourism without freedom of movement of people because visas are inherently hard to obtain because of bureaucracy and complicated immigration policies . 
   are you fucking serious i did n't mean to offend you , but this is true . 
   [ yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslavia ) was a country in southeast europe during most of the 20th century . 
  lots of people left the country during the war as refugees . 
  much like how syrians are doing today . 
   you are really bad at arguing , wow . 
  tl ; dr : you 're bad at arguing because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
   you very clearly told me i was wrong no . 
  i explained you the difference but you ignored it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qu8e3/a_bit_of_me_is_dying_but_i_cant_stay_the_eu/dl0b9q4/ you said that ** they are leaving `` for better work '' ** elsewhere . 
  i said that ** they are leaving because work in the uk is `` going down '' ** . 
  ** these are two different scenarios . 
  ** you can leave a company because you found better work elsewhere , like you said . 
  and you can leave a company because the company is going bankrupt and that you still need money for food . 
   i ca n't even understand your points my friend . 
  i 'm sorry , but you do n't get to be my friend after insulting me . 
   this started because you said brexit will affect tourists . 
  [ brexit is set to damage britain 's tourism industry ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/wef-tourism-competitiveness-report-brexit-impact-on-uk-tourism-2017-4 )  there have been warnings , however , that the industry risks significant long-term damage after brexit , despite an initial uptick as the falling pound made it cheaper to visit . 
   `` there is no international fall-back option '' for aviation after brexit ... ... .  visa waivers do not equate to freedom of movement why ? 
  because you say so ? 
   prior to your joining the eu you needed visas because you were n't included in the visa waiver system that preceded it . 
  you did n't have freedom of movement because you did n't have freedom of movement . 
  you 're repeating yourself , bro . 
  that 's the path to insanity . 
  ** i asked for proof , not you repeating the same ideas from before . 
  **  now , to address the quote you 've given me , it is true that freedom of movement has limitations as well . 
  finally , some progress . 
  do you agree that there are several types of freedom of movement ? 
  i already linked you to the official eu site that explains them in detail in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qmuze/citizens_protest_on_spanish_island_of_majorca/dl0ajv1/ ) comment . 
  can we both agree that ** `` freedom of movement '' is a generic and vague term that has limitations on each specific type of freedom of movement depending on each country ** ? 
  because this was my point all along . 
   i will enjoy my lunch washed down with salty romanian tears . 
  only the freshest . 
  i 'm not the one who 's salty . 
  but what do i know ? 
  i 'm not a doctor in the nhs . 
  have a nice day . 
  this discussion is over . 
   do you understand how much european money is invested in the uk ? 
  do you understand how much british money is invested in the eu ? 
  [ divisions exposed over # 66bn brexit divorce bill ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/18/eu-talks-divided-over-britains-brexit-divorce-bill-mooted-at-66bn )  i 'll give you a clue , it 's more than the entire gdp of romania . 
  whataboutism at its best . 
  because why focus on my own problems when i can point out how poor others are ? 
   i wonder how many people would still be alive if this rule was applied to the bataclan . 
  because only muslims kill people with guns and it 's safe to assume that all of them are terrorists . 
   you 're just pathetic troll this right here is the really sad part . 
  this discussion is over . 
   and you fail to understand that the cost of living is also a lot higher in the uk than it is in eastern europe . 
  yet they still manage without complaining while also taking shit from the likes of you . 
   i do not represent my heritage or culture . 
  because i am not my country . 
  tl ; dr : i do not represent my heritage or culture but i can say that immigrants are destroying our country because i live here and i know better . 
   no point debating with someone who openly refuses to be wrong . 
  tl ; dr : you 're wrong because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
   how many british citizens move to romania to reap the benefits of their health service i wonder ? 
  wow ... did you really go there ? 
  switching to whataboutism in order to discredit the point made earlier ? 
  great tactic , bro . 
  enjoy your lunch . 
   nothing changed around me since brexit therefore nothing has changed in the world . 
  / s great logic , bro . 
   yes , because you 'd only left the soviet bloc a few years ago . 
  this is not true for everyone else !!!, 
  how many times do i have to say this . 
  this is irrelevant , mate . 
  we 're discussing what freedom of movement means , not romania 's history .
