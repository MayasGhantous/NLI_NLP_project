  this is so common that even the verb `` to ship '' comes from sea faring ships . 
   also takes a lot longer then how do you explain the companies than catch fish in us coastal sea , ship it by sea to china to have it processed , then ship it back to the us by sea for it to be sold ? 
   the only way the eu changed holidaying inside of europe for most europeans was that you could use an id card instead of a passport . 
  this is false . 
  before joining the eu , romanians were required passports and visas for travel in most eu countries regardless of their purpose for travel including tourism . 
  ** tourism arrivals in romania exploded from 5.8 million in 2005 to 8.8 million in 2008 after we entered the eu in 2007 . 
  ** http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/st.int.arvl?locations=ro  freedom of movement is not about holidays , it 's about working and residency . 
  where 's your proof ? 
  i already provided you with articles that say otherwise . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement#residence_restriction  despite the fact that you may be able to travel to and return from other countries , most governments still restrict the number of days you are allowed to stay in the country . 
  the amount of days you are allowed to stay depends on the country you are a citizen of , and the country you travelled to . 
  in some instances ( such as refugees who risk the death penalty upon returning to their country ) , indefinite stay may be allowed , but ** in most other cases , stay is generally limited to a few months ** . 
  one notable exception to this is the schengen area , where citizens of any country in the eu generally enjoy indefinite stay in other eu countries . 
  you 're confusing freedom of movement of people with that of the workforce . 
  they are different things . 
  [ free movement of persons ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_2.1.3.html ) [ free movement of goods ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_3.1.2.html ) [ free movement of workers ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_3.1.3.html ) [ free movement of capital ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_3.1.6.html ) all you 've done so far is say that i 'm wrong without providing any proof . 
  saying that i 'm wrong does n't make it so . 
  this is good to hear . 
   we have an incredible healthcare system [ record number of eu citizens quit working in nhs last year ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/record-number-european-staff-quit-nhs-brexit-eu )  and high standards of living what does economic migrants leaving the uk for greener pastures tell you about the uk ? 
  i really hope things will turn out ok for everybody , but the things that are happening urge for caution and pragmatism . 
   economic migrants have always jumped ship when a country starts going down . 
  what does them jumping ship on the uk tell you about the uk ? 
   so why after economic recovery money sent in romania are 44 % of pre-crisis levels ? 
  because of the 2008 crisis . 
  read the article . 
  foreign investments dropped after the 2008 crisis from over 9 million euro to 3 million euro . 
  if anything , this proves the point that lots of romanians still work abroad with the intention of returning . 
   remember that germany has an open land border with several country 's while the uk is an island and is competing just as well . 
  so , germany is doing better than the uk because it 's not an island ? 
  germany is doing better because it does n't have as many international trade ports like the uk ? 
   and yet it is being twisted like they have no choice and they are the victims of some conspiracy . 
  this is false . 
  nobody is forcing them to do anything yet . 
  that 's not the point of the article . 
  the point of the article is that they are pragmatic about their future in uk . 
  this means that they do n't know for sure what will happen because everything is uncertain right now . 
  and this goes for everyone living in the uk , not just immigrants . 
   please come back with a real argument to my opinion stated in the second paragraph rather than this false tldr you mean this paragraph ? 
   please just leave and stop moaning about nonsense there 's little to say about that other than good luck trying to fill all of those jobs that you do n't want . 
   not because of any punishment , but if people have to fill in a visa every time they have to move accross the channel for whatever , they 'll move their hq out of london ... you 'd think this is common sense and that people could have foreseen it . 
  nope . 
  they are denying it even while it 's actually happening . 
   this mentality that caused the brexit is what kept the great britain as a global superpowe care to elaborate ? 
  how did the `` brexit mentality '' maintain the uk as a superpower ? 
  remember that they were , and still are , part of the eu . 
  that had nothing to do with it , right ? 
   no , they did n't . 
  tl ; dr : you 're wrong because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
   out-migration from romania is continuing to this day , ** at a lower pace ** but romania is a `` depopulated economic wasteland '' !, 
  below is the translation . 
   from 2006 to 2015 , romanians from abroad have sent home 52 billion ( 52000 millions ) euro while foreign investments during that same time were at 41 billion euro . 
  pocket change , right ? 
   i however do live in a city and all the eu nationals i know are not that concerned and wish to stay tl ; dr : i 'm right because i think my friends say so . 
   yes i know better than you ... because i live here my whole life tl ; dr : i 'm right because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
  do all the people that live in czechia agree with you because `` they live there '' ? 
   nazis wo n't ever get to the power in the germany lol . 
  they already did . 
  those who forget history are doomed to repeat it . 
  you 're not forgetting history , you 're ignoring it . 
  this is worse than not knowing because you knowingly ignore the example from the past and present . 
  these things are not only happening in czechia . 
  you already know this , but your hubris prevents you from admitting it . 
   nice goal post moving . 
  so you agree the greek moved for nothing then . 
   i addressed the issue itself by saying that i 'm skeptical about theresa may 's promises . 
  she 's not exactly well known for keeping her promises . 
  she 's more known as an opportunist . 
  i also said that these words are not official policy and that there is still no official policy . 
  you 're expecting people to plan their future based on the promises of theresa may ? 
  well , then , excuse me for being skeptical . 
   what makes you think they 'll go back to ukraine ? 
  the fact that they do . 
  the same happened in romania . 
  remember the `` strawberry picking '' romanians that massively emigrated to spain and co ? 
  most of them have returned and almost all of them were sending the money they made in spain back to their families in romania . 
  the same goes for poland . 
  sure , lots of them will stay for the long run , but most do it in order to help their families back in ukraine . 
  this has always been the case . 
  is romania a `` depopulated economic wasteland '' ? 
  people are still leaving , but you never look at the returning statistics , you just look at the departures . 
   from that date eu workers moving to the uk will have to register , at least until a permanent post-brexit immigration policy is put in place . 
  this is about eu workers moving to the uk , it 's not about eu workers that already live in the uk . 
   honestly it 's like brexit made people irrational or something . 
  these are only `` offers '' and negotiations . 
  nothing is clear as to what will happen after brexit . 
   `` theresa may made clear to us today that eu citizens that have been in britain for five years will retain their full rights . 
  that is a good start , '' merkel told reporters . 
  what about those that have been in the uk for less than 5 years ? 
   this really news ? 
  yep . 
  why ? 
  because people are leaving the uk `` for better work '' as you said . 
  what does this mean ? 
  it means that the uk will have a lot of vacant jobs because people will no longer be interested to work there . 
  is this news ? 
  i do n't know . 
  is it ? 
   since they 've been living there for more than 5 years they 'll be allowed to remain .
