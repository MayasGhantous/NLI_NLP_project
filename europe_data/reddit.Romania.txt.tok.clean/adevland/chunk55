  til that / u/low _ discrepancy can predict the future . 
  / s  that 's what may said . 
  enough with the bullshit that makes it seem like the purge is coming . 
  where and when did she say this , exactly ? 
  the officials say otherwise . 
  [ brexit : uk-eu freedom of movement ` to end in march 2019 ' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40734504 ), 
   i do n't even live in a major city but i 've got a few poles , a gay french couple and random other european nationals ... `` and runs with it as proof '' . 
  great logic , bro . 
   a few ** whiney ungrateful fuckers ** who got all their chances in the uk , received free healthcare whilst popping out a few kids and decide to leave , adi\u00f3s !, 
  boom !, 
  proof !, 
  deal with it !, 
   are you impliying you ca n't hate people when you finally end up meeting them ? 
  he met some of them . 
  he still hates all them . 
  he is no longer a xenophobe . 
  next !, 
   they have that stability since they 've lived for 5 years in uk . 
  that stability is now under doubt because of brexit . 
  the rules that allowed them to stay will disappear in less than 2 years . 
  there 's no guarantee that they will get to stay . 
  this is like receiving a potential eviction notice with the exact date of eviction known , but not knowing whether or not it will happen . 
   if you dislike one place , you move . 
  there 's a lot of uncertainty right now . 
  there is n't enough information to form such an opinion of `` like '' or `` dislike '' . 
  those that stay , do so knowing that they may have to leave , while those that leave do so knowing that they could have stayed . 
  the brexit negotiations are n't going well . 
  there is no certainty right now and people are rightfully worried about their future . 
  and this goes for all those that live in the uk , not just the immigrants . 
   i 'm supposed to feel sorry that this greek guy moved around europe and hit jack pot after jack pot ? 
  most people are n't like that . 
  most people do n't like changing their home every couple of years . 
  most people want stability . 
  the point of the article is that , because of brexit , lots of people are now doubting the stability of their homes in the uk . 
  homes for which they worked a good portion of their lives . 
  and here you come telling them that they have to start over because it 's fun to `` move around europe '' ? 
   because they 're ~ ~ racist ~ ~ ** xenophobic ** fucks fixed . 
   it would be whataboutism if i were saying it as a diversionary tactic , but i 'm not . 
  it would be stupid for you to admit it being a diversionary tactic . 
  whataboutism tries to discredit an argument by exposing the opponents hypocrisy . 
  admitting to doing this would crumble the entire diversion . 
  i 'm trying to create a diversion over here . 
  do n't look over there . 
  look over here !, 
  great tactic , bro . 
   i 'm not anti-eu . 
  i just think the guardian is a crap paper . 
  you said that `` this from the guardian , who is a crap paper '' in order to discredit the current article . 
  this is not ok . read it and judge it objectively . 
  feel free to judge the guardian all you want , but judge each article objectively . 
  why ? 
  because generalization is , generally , a bad idea . 
   relying on redditors to downvote articles that misrepresent reality rather than just ones they disagree with ? 
   hmmm making fun of people that uphold objective criticism ? 
  hmmm that 's a double standard , bro . 
  you 're defending yourself to the detriment of objective criticism . 
  and that 's because you ca n't admit to being wrong about something . 
  redditors not admittinng to being wrong and doing whatever they can to discredit those that oppose their opinions ? 
  hmmm, 
  one does not imply the other . 
  statistically , however , xenophobes also tend to be racists because both are based on hate of the unknown . 
  these people are literally afraid and hate things that they do not understand . 
   the latest attempt to cut into chancellor angela merkel 's formidable electoral lead is unwisely betting that germans will forget a significant chunk of german history . 
   on wednesday , the car industry chiefs will attend a `` diesel summit '' called by the government to look for solutions . 
  that 's part of merkel 's pre-election strategy , though she 's not scheduled to attend . 
  rivals , especially the greens and the social democrats , are claiming she 's been too cozy with the industry bosses over the years , which makes her culpable for the seemingly endless stream of scandals . 
  the chancellor needs to show she 's got things under control so she can hold on to her double-digit lead in the polls . 
  they are politicizing this thing from the second paragraph of the article and go as far as giving advice to the chancellor for a problem they are pinning on her because of perceived `` cozying '' up to the industry `` over the years '' . 
  an industry which was a national pride `` over the years '' . 
  so , people are allowed to change their minds and say that the german auto industry is `` built on colluding '' , but merkel and co must be forever remembered as those that got too `` cozy '' to the industry `` over the years '' ? 
  why the double standard ? 
   then complain about xenophobia in the next article if you want to judge the news entity that publishes these articles , you are free to do so , but do n't judge one article based on others . 
  that 's whatboutism . 
   the tactic is a type of logical fallacy that attempts to discredit the opponent 's position by accusing hypocrisy . 
  it functions as a diversionary tactic to distract the opponent from their original criticism . 
  thus , the technique is used to avoid directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
   2 ) judging articles based on who wrote it is a good way of guessing the journalist 's agenda i agree . 
  but people use this to form preconceptions for other articles which they judge without reading . 
  this is not ok .  3 ) this sub bans submissions from certain sources it really should n't . 
  people should be able to decide for themselves and down-vote the articles that are misrepresenting reality . 
   i thought that 's what i was doing . 
  you referred to another article from the guardian and suggested that we judge this article based on another one . 
   address the point , you fucking moron i have . 
  but you keep insulting me instead of proving your claims . 
  saying that i 'm wrong is n't proof . 
   as it turns out this whole thread is about you not comprehending the basic difference between judicial self-government and local administration , which are two completely unrelated institutions . 
  you misunderstood my point . 
   under a 2017 draft law aimed at reforming the national council of the judiciary , ** the 15 judges nominated by the self-governments ** would , instead , be elected by the sejm . 
  those 15 judges are part of the judiciary , which they represent , but they are elected by the self-governments . 
  this is my point .

  insulting me does n't make you look smart and it does n't make you right . 
   ok , just fucking stfu . 
  insulting me does n't make you right . 
   you clearly have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . 
  using caps lock does n't make you right . 
   you fucking moron .
