  why do you do this ? 
  it 's not an `` overtly racist country '' , but it does have a big problem with xenophobia . 
  things are n't black and white as you make them out to be . 
   i think the way for good integration in a society like sweden might be to take a small number , educate , employ and integrate them and then take more and what do you do with the others ? 
  do you deny them their right to asylum ? 
   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm mass immigration is a tough problem . 
  there are no simple solutions . 
  it will solve itself in time . 
  after a turning point number of them will get educated and integrated in the work force , they will contribute to the economy more than the others are costing in welfare . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
  this takes longer in some countries and less in others depending on how welcoming people are . 
   but with what we 've gained we 're also becoming less helpful and trusting of others , and problems need to be said and discussed instead of sweeping them under rugs . 
  on this we can agree . 
  it 's not ok to blame your own problems on immigrants and it 's not ok when some of them commit crimes . 
  you have to treat them like everyone else . 
  if they break the law , deport/jail them . 
  otherwise , they should be given the same opportunities like everyone else . 
   first , you 're using ppp adjusted figures . 
  that 's not really appropriate for an international economic comparison because it bases its adjustment on local goods prices rather than the world market . 
  first of all ,  the european union is the second largest economy in the world ( if treated as a single country ) ** in nominal terms and according to purchasing power parity ( ppp ) ** . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union secondly , ppp adjusted figures are the ones always used in international comparisons of economies because an orange is an orange regardless of its price . 
  making 10 times more money is irrelevant if the prices are also 10 times higher . 
  if your higher salary buys you 5 oranges in the us , it does n't make you richer than somebody in the eu that has a lower salary but who can also afford to buy 5 or more oranges . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity  deviations from parity imply differences in purchasing power of a `` basket of goods '' across countries , which means that ** for the purposes of many international comparisons , countries ' gdps or other national income statistics need to be `` ppp-adjusted ** '' and converted into common units . 
  ... ... ... ...  second , the eu is set to lose around $ 2.6 tn of its gdp in 2019 , so i would n't get too smug yet . 
  i 'm talking about the present , about facts , not about what you think might happen in the future . 
   these sounds like issues every non-homogenous country deals with one way or another . 
  and this sounds like you 're trying to water-down a serious problem . 
   i also daresay it 's not the skinheads going after jews in malm\u00f6 . 
  so it 's immigrants that are n't offering other immigrants equal job opportunities , right ? 
   the report racism and xenophobia in sweden by the board of integration state that muslims are exposed to the most religious harassment in sweden . 
  almost 40 % of the interviewed said they had witnessed verbal abuse directed at muslims . 
  historically , attitudes towards muslims in sweden have been mixed with relations being largely negative in the early 16th century , improving in the 18th century , and declining once again with the rise of swedish nationalism in the early 20th century . 
  according to jonas otterbeck , a swedish historian of religion , attitudes towards islam and muslims today have improved but `` the level of prejudice was and is still high . '', 
  islamophobia can manifest itself through discrimination in the workforce , prejudiced coverage in the media , and violence against muslims . 
  germany is n't perfect in this regard , either , but their attitude towards immigrants is better . 
   in spite of the considerable number of non-citizens who have been living in germany for a long time or even from birth , there was a reluctance by germany to consider itself as a country of immigration . '' persons of immigrant origin , including those who are second or third generation born in germany , tended to remain ` foreigners ' in german statistics and public discourse . 
   according to the united nations , people with a migrant background also `` are under-represented in important institutions , including the political system , the police and the courts . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism_in_germany still , this is way better than how people in sweden are treating them . 
   just did not seem accurate , but maybe i was wrong in my interpretation and reaction . 
  i have a saying that says that it 's generally a bad idea to generalize . 
    perhaps it 's simply the gigantic economy that can transform anyone into an effective cog in the machine , but what do i know about germany . 
  it 's a long term investment . 
  if you manage to educate and find them jobs while also not accusing them of `` stealing your jobs '' , they actually become productive members of society . 
  look at stuttgart . 
  over 40 % of its population is of migrant descent and most of them are turkish , yet there 's no culture shift going on , the economy is doing great and the city has one of the lowest crime rates in the entire world , not just germany . 
   what are the employment opportunities for fresh arrived refugees there ? 
  germany has a huge auto-motive industry . 
  this means lots of jobs for people with average education . 
  sweden has a more service oriented job industry that requires highly educated workers . 
  this does n't mean that migrants ca n't get those jobs . 
  they can . 
  they can be as smart as everyone else if properly educated . 
  you just have to try and give them a chance . 
   your quote points specifically to university students & the middle class . 
  some of the middle class women protested to keep the hijab because of `` culture and tradition '' . 
  after the iranian revolution happened and the hijab became mandatory because of the new totalitarian rule , they flip-flopped and started protesting against wearing it . 
  [ women protesting forced hijab days after the iranian revolution , 1979 ] ( http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/women-protesting-hijab-1979/ ) ultra nationalist sentiments lead to politicians taking away rights from people . 
  the uk just made a law that from 2018 will enforce mandatory id checks for watching porn . 
  they are also currently discussing banning encryption . 
  history is repeating itself . 
  the `` protect our culture and tradition '' rhetoric will soon turn into `` protect our rights and democracy '' . 
  [ people need to remember and learn from history . 
  https://www.thebalance.com/world-s-largest-economy-3306044  the european union was in second place , generating $ 19.2 trillion . 
  together , china and the eu generate 33.9 percent of the world 's economic output of $ 119.4 trillion . 
   the united states fell to third place , producing $ 18.6 trillion . 
  guess who 's building walls and who 's building bridges . 
  also , the eu does n't want a `` trade war '' with anybody . 
  trump is just being butt-hurt that his policies are failing and he feels the need to assert dominance via vague threats . 
   better quality products are on in supermarkets , but people still buy the cheapest stuff on sale . 
  the debate is not about other products . 
  it 's about the exact products that have different compositions when compared to the ones sold in western europe . 
  it 's about how the quality of the same product changes for the worst when it 's being sold in eastern europe . 
   you 're saying they do n't tolerate the presence of immigrants - what do you base this on ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism_in_sweden  racism and xenophobia have been reported and investigated in sweden . 
  according to the european network against racism , ** skin color , ethnic/religious background have significant impact on an individual 's opportunities in the labor market ** , affecting mainly roma , blacks , muslims , and jews . 
  some ethnic minorities , for example jews in the city of malm\u00f6 , are also at larger risk to face threats and violence . 
  ... ...  and has germany really been such a success-story you paint it as ? 
  if i 'm up to date they have as well had their problems and continue to do so . 
  why do people assume that if someone is doing better than you , it automatically means that they are perfect ? 
  it does n't . 
  i never said that germany is doing a perfect job . 
  i said that they are doing a better job than sweden at integrating immigrants . 
  they always have . 
   no , it do n't . 
  i ca n't believe you are off by 230 millions in your estimate of the population of your own political union . 
  others have already mentioned this . 
  i 've edited the comment . 
   i find it very hard to believe it was n't effectively mandatory for the overwhelming majority of females in iran . 
  read about the iranian revolution from 1979 . 
  the exact opposite was happening . 
  at first , the state tried to forcibly enforce this . 
  then they made it optional . 
  then the people revolted because of how the state was trying to `` oppress their identity and culture '' , ( does this sound familiar ? ), 
  and the whole middle east plunged into totalitarianism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hijab_by_country#iran  a few years prior to the iranian revolution , a tendency towards questioning the relevance of eurocentric gender roles as the model for iranian society gained much ground among university students , and this sentiment was manifested in street demonstrations where many women from the non-veiled middle classes put on the veil and symbolically rejected the gender ideology of pahlavi regime and its aggressive deculturalization . 
  ** many argued that veiling should be restored to stop further dissolution of the iranian identity and culture ** does any of this sound familiar ? 
  tl ; dr : the middle east was actively trying to be more welcoming to foreign culture , then people started to fight this by saying that their `` identity and culture '' are being threatened just how some people in the eu are now doing . 
  and this has led to a revolution that plunged middle eastern countries into totalitarianism . 
   that 's way it 's `` works ok in comparision to '' , not `` works ok '' you 're generalizing .
