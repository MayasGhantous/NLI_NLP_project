  the proposal has the potential to impact all eu members . 
  also , you can get the signatures from all of the eu countries , not just your own . 
  the eu has a population of ~ ~ 743.1 ~ ~ about 500 million . 
  you have to convince about 1 person in 500 . 
   your map says they got released at 19:40 and are currently sailing . 
  the map currently shows the ship as being stopped just south of cyprus . 
   shoving brexit in there is a clear troll . 
  this has everything to do with brexit . 
  the guy who resigned is the author of the `` brexit vision '' for the tories . 
   theresa may 's director of strategy has become the latest member of her senior team to quit , leaving the premier without the authors of her brexit vision at a critical time in negotiations with the european union . 
   you mistranslated the title , it actually says `` brought '' , not `` bring '' . 
  the polish government is clearly infected . 
  they are unfit for duty . 
   but can someone please explain me why the uk government did n't come up with a plan before they started the article 50 procedure . 
  they 're still trying to figure that one out for themselves . 
  the person they hired to figure it out just resigned . 
  that 's the topic of the article . 
   it seems more logical to me to figure out what you want first planning something like brexit takes a long time . 
  if they did n't plan it , it means that they did n't expect brexit to actually happen . 
  they were using it as a way to blame the eu for all their troubles . 
  they were bluffing . 
  and it backfired . 
  twice . 
  they even lost their parliament majority . 
  this is the only plausible explanation . 
   we obviously have a different idea of friend and friendly . 
  knowing when to graciously quit is a virtue . 
  that being said , i 'm going to `` go back under my rock '' . 
  cheers . 
   i sometimes feel bad for her , then i remember how she used to run around the wheat fields . 
  they 're all running around in wheat fields now . 
  their strategy chief never looked back . 
   and your statement there was n't ? 
  it 's friendly advice using your own words . 
  this only proves how you consider your own words to be `` provocative in nature '' . 
   his opening statement was provocative in nature . 
  so you replied with more provocation because that 's a good idea . 
  / s this is the point where you should heed your own advice and  go back under your rock . 
   what can they do op ? 
  not much . 
  well ... they did take off their tops . 
  that 's something , i guess . 
  / s if the fire gets worse , you could probably expect the tourists in the area to go fully nude , right ? 
   people like you are why ca n't get a good civilised debate on this matter he 's got a point , though . 
  things are crumbling instead of moving forward . 
   go back under your rock . 
  now that 's a `` civilised debate '' right there . 
   `` we wo n't accept blackmail on the part of eu officials , especially blackmail that is not based on facts . 
  all the laws prepared by the polish parliament are in compliance with the constitution and democratic rules , '' he said . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm right because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
  also , great job ignoring the thousands of people who are protesting this . 
  they 've all clearly been manipulated and/or paid by soros . 
   let 's sift through the disinformation by posting real disinformation from an obviously biased site . 
  huffingtonpost ? 
  pfff ... fake news !, 
  pronews.gr is where the real shit is at . 
  / s seriously , though , you can track the ship [ here ] ( http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:748241/mmsi:621819012/imo:7392854/vessel:c_star ) . 
  it shows it moored at the port of famagusta in northern cyprus as of 24 hours ago . 
  you can track the ship [ here ] ( http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:748241/mmsi:621819012/imo:7392854/vessel:c_star ) . 
  the youtube comments are filled with people with absolutely no clue about what they just watched . 
  it 's funny and sad at the same time . 
   it was a delay over something that did n't benefit the uk in any way  it slowed down a deal that would have helped uk trade , in exchange for no benefit to the uk there will be no more slowdowns and no more ceta once you 're out of the eu . 
  sorry that you had to wait and do nothing while we fought for something that you were getting by default . 
  i hope it was n't too much of a nuisance . 
   how do you not profit off of tourists ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is freedom of movement and the lack of it . 
  the point is that us citizens can visit romania without a visa , and over 137 000 of them do so annually even though some claim that they have no interest in doing so . 
  that 's a double standard . 
  that 's hypocrisy . 
  the us benefits from freedom of movement without reciprocating it . 
  that 's abusive and unfair . 
  and it 's not just romania in this situation . 
   i want them to approach it from the perspective of this country 's interests in 2016 , [ 137,586 us citizens visited romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_romania ) , whereas [ less than 7000 romanians traveled to north america in 2015 ] ( http://www.insse.ro/cms/sites/default/files/field/publicatii/romanian_tourism_2016.pdf ) . 
  i 'd say that the us is profiting a lot from the visa free travel to romania while romanians get nothing in return . 
   your country could force all americans to apply for a visa to enter romania . 
  you could easily do that , given that you 're not in schengen doing this would be a dick move by romania . 
  if the eu agrees , then and only then it 's ok . 
  the visa free travel to romania for us citizens is part of an eu wide directive . 
  if romania acts up on this , then it risks to destabilize the deal for other countries and we really do n't want to be `` that guy '' . 
  this is tolerated , for now , because of the `` greater good '' that the whole of the eu benefits from , except romania and 4 others . 
   romania : heres some free stuff !, 
   us : oh ok  romania : now give me free things . 
   us : no thanks  romania : unfair !, 
  it 's not just about romania , it 's about the whole eu . 
  us citizens can move freely throughout the entire eu while only some eu citizens can do this . 
   romanians want to come to the us , americans do n't want to go to romania . 
  in 2016 , [ 137,586 us citizens visited romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_romania ) , whereas [ less than 7000 romanians traveled to north america in 2015 ] ( http://www.insse.ro/cms/sites/default/files/field/publicatii/romanian_tourism_2016.pdf ) . 
  i 'd say that you 're profiting a lot from the visa free travel to romania while romanians get nothing in return . 
   that 's easy for romania to say because nobody wants to immigrate there . 
  this is n't true . 
   in 2013 , there were 198,839 immigrants living in romania , of which 13,000 were refugees . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_romania i live in bucharest . 
  i see more and more foreigners by each passing season . 
   if they had to deal with the disruptions caused by mass emigration they might think differently . 
  does canada have to deal with mass immigration ? 
  romania also has immigrants . 
  also , this is n't about immigrants . 
  ceta does n't allow for permanent stays .
