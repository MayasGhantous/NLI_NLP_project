  the stays are limited to the duration of the work contract , which usually means 1 year . 
  because if it 's `` funded by soros '' , it 's automatically fake news , amirite ? 
   i was using it as an example of how trade neogotiations get more complicated as more countries get involved . 
  that 's not the only factor , though . 
  the less countries are involved , the less leverage you have . 
  that means there 's less to negotiate upon . 
  negotiating `` chlorinated chicken '' trade between the us and uk is considerably less complicated just because it only involves `` chlorinated chicken '' . 
   i do n't blame your country for seeking visa-free travel for its citizens , but that inevitably makes things more difficult for my country to push its own stuff forward . 
  why is it more difficult ? 
  unless you have something against romanians , in particular , working there , there should be no problem to say yes to all qualified workers , regardless of their country of origin . 
  you do expect your workers to be able to come to romania but you do not expect romanians to come to your country . 
  how is that fair ? 
  ** right now all us citizens can travel in the eu without a visa . 
  romanians , bulgarians and others need a visa while germans and other eu countries do not need a visa to travel to the us . 
  how is this fair ? 
   yet you still seem to believe that the overall crime rate measures whether a country has become more dangerous or not . 
  i never said this , bro . 
  i actually never even mentioned the `` overall crime rate '' in this discussion . 
  please do not make assumptions on my behalf . 
   that one was for sex crimes , but you can get the info for general violent crimes from the same sources . 
  bro , it 's your argument . 
  you 're the one who 's supposed to defend it . 
  do you expect me to defend your claims ? 
  if you ca n't do it , then nobody will . 
   when people stay at home more , stop going out alone , avoid certain areas more than before , the violent crime rates fall . 
  wow !, 
  really ? 
  crime rates drop when people stay at home ? 
  holy shit !, 
  who knew ? 
   that does n't mean the country has become safer , it means people have adapted their behavior to the more dangerous conditions . 
  this sounds a lot like you 're trying to `` hide the stats that matter '' by interpreting them to your liking . 
  also , you 've posted no stats . 
  you 've only made claims that have yet to be proved . 
  i asked you for facts , not your opinion . 
   poland has hit back , accusing the commission of `` blackmail '' . 
  blackmail is  the action , treated as a criminal offence , of demanding money from someone in return for not revealing ** compromising information ** which one has about them . 
  what 's the compromising information ? 
  that poland was trying to undermine the independence of judges ? 
   romania was insisting on their citizens being allowed visa-free travel to canada this would truly be the end of the world , right ? 
  having romanians working in canada under ceta is what really keeps you awake at night , right ? 
   tl ; dr : my time has value yet here you are . 
  if you had any proof , you could have found it by now instead of `` wasting '' your time saying that `` your time is valuable '' . 
   the data is not fake , it 's just presented in the way that makes the open-borders nonsense palatable , by hiding the stats that matter . 
  how exactly is the wikipedia article `` hiding the stats that matter '' ? 
  be specific . 
   i do n't have to prove anything to you . 
  i have shit to do , just like everyone else . 
  tl ; dr : make a crazy claim that you ca n't prove then leave . 
  great logic , bro . 
  top shelf fake news tactic right there . 
   what you find in those articles is an expression of political power , both within wikipedia bureaucracy/hierarchy and within western academia and media . 
  so the german government official statistics are fake ? 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
  because that 's what the article is about . 
   on the other hand , it will also mean that we wo n't have to take into account the economic concerns of countries like greece , bulgaria , romania , etc. 
  in order to formulate a position . 
  god forbid if some random romanian companies want to take part in the glorious trade of chlorinated chicken . 
  only great world powers like the us are allowed to trade in these highly sought after commodities like chlorinated chicken and allowing other less developed nations to take part in it would only diminish the prestige of these products . 
   because you 're in denial and too lazy to check for yourself . 
  it 's your claim . 
  you have to prove it , not me . 
   would be a lot easier if i just parroted the propaganda pushed by german media , like you . 
  it would be wrong , but it would be easy . 
  on this we can both agree . 
  the media has done a lot of harm by distorting facts and presenting them in out of context scenarios . 
  also , the links i posted are not from the media . 
  they 're official german government statistics from an article about immigrant crime in germany on wikipedia . 
  is wikipedia also part of the `` biased german media '' ? 
  are the official german government statistics `` fake news '' ? 
   why should it be better for 10 children to be raped by 10 different guys rather than all be raped by the same one ? 
  the problem is that sex crimes in germany have little to no penalties . 
  this goes for all perpetrators , regardless if they are refugees or not . 
   and half the prison population around stuttgart have turkish roots . 
  do you have a source for this or did you pull it out of your ass ? 
  statistics that i mentioned before show that stuttgart is one of the safest cities in the world , not just germany . 
   do you wan na guess what percentage of sexual crimes are reported ? 
  for refugees or germans ? 
  and the answer is no because this is n't a guessing game . 
  nice job ignoring everything else i said and for continuing to echo the same out of context statistics . 
   why has violent crime perpetrated by germans decreased 20 % within one year ? 
  where 's the source for this ? 
  also , what does this have to do with refugee related crimes ? 
   694 per 100000 that 's crimes per population which is misleading because most of them are perpetrated by repeat offenders . 
  read the wikipedia article . 
   the figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders , and that ** 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes ** . 
  you 're blaming the crimes of a minority on the entire group they are part of . 
  groups that live in refugee camps under miserable conditions . 
  these crimes happen because of these miserable conditions . 
   compared to e.g. 
  34.1 / 100k for german citizens that do not live in refugee camps . 
  look at [ stuttgart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuttgart#immigrants ) . 
  40 % of the city 's population is of foreign background . 
  over 32 000 of them are turkish . 
  regardless of this ,  stuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in germany . 
  in 2003 , 8535 crimes were committed in stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants ( versus the average for all german cities of 12,751 ) . 
  and here 's more recent data : https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings.jsp stuttgart is one of the safest cities in the world despite having over 40 % of its population with migrant descent . 
  why ? 
  because none of those immigrants live in refugee camps . 
   whereas violent crime by foreigners has increased 60 % .
