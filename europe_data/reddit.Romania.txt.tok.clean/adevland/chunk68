  if the reforms pass , the polish justice minister will be able to appoint and dismiss judges on his own . 
   nominating for what ? 
  nominating people for the judge position . 
  that 's how it works . 
  they want to change it so that the executive branch can nominate judges in the judicial branch . 
  this breaches the separation of powers principle which is vital for democracy . 
   next time you 're in milan just go outside the milano centrale railway station for a minute . 
  then you 'll understand . 
  you gave up on having a logical and argument driven discussion and , instead , have retreated into the `` i 've seen some refugees and i do n't like them '' bubble . 
   would you support ceausescu 's courts if people try to overthrow them ? 
  i bet you would . 
  i would n't . 
  why do you say that ? 
   situation in poland is similar only problem is eu like lefists regimes much more than rightwing democtraticaly elected goverments . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  it 's not about `` leftists '' versus `` right wingers '' . 
  it 's about the fight against corruption . 
  you ca n't have this fight without an independent judicial system . 
   they often do . 
  how often do `` cultural conflicts '' kill people ? 
  do you have examples ? 
  statistics ? 
   certainly have worsened because of it . 
  correlation does n't imply causation . 
  they have been worsening since the us and european countries started wars in the middle east . 
   have you read this study from my country starting diversity causing a dip in social cohesion ? 
  not surprising since diversity is division by its very nature . 
  it 's citizens rejecting immigrants that creates the division in society . 
  you are completely ignoring this aspect . 
  some countries , like sweden , have openly rejected immigrants , while other countries , like germany ( see the stuttgart example ) have done a much better job at integrating them without having `` social cohesion '' problems . 
  germany has the best eu economy and a huge budget surplus for the past 3 years , despite having the most refugees in the eu . 
   i doubt that [ greece : refugee `` hotspots '' unsafe , unsanitary ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/19/greece-refugee-hotspots-unsafe-unsanitary )  `` in europe 's version of refugee camps , women and children who fled war face daily violence and live in fear , '' said bill frelick , refugee rights director at human rights watch . 
  `` lack of police protection , overcrowding , and unsanitary conditions create an atmosphere of chaos and insecurity in greece 's razor wire-fenced island camps . '' there 's also this [ immigration and crime in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_and_crime_in_germany )  the figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders , and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes . 
  ... ...  , but funny how you only mention refugees with regards to crime when we all know mena immigrants and their descendants are much more criminal than native europeans . 
  not true . 
   a report released by the german federal office of criminal investigation in november 2015 found that over the period january -- september 2015 , ** the crime rate of refugees was the same as that of native germans ** . 
  the problem is that of repeat offenders and poor living conditions in refugee camps . 
  deport the repeat offenders and increase living conditions inside refugee camps . 
   cultural conflicts kill people ? 
   religious extremism and terrorism have been a problem long before the migrant crisis started . 
   racial displacement is n't killing `` indigenous europeans '' . 
  old age is . 
  what 's keeping from having kids ? 
   the loss of social cohesion have you ever heard of [ stuttgart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuttgart#immigrants ) ? 
  it 's a german city with more than 40 % of its population with migrant descent . 
  most of them , more than 19000 , are turkish . 
  they 've integrated nicely without disturbing the `` social cohesion '' . 
   higher crime most immigrant related crimes happen inside asylum centers because of the poor living conditions . 
  they are fighting each other over trivial disputes that stem from not having proper living conditions . 
   the truth would no change , no . 
  has it ? 
  the problem with a failed project is that neutrality is negative . 
  you are not making any sense . 
   taking them in will mean our death . 
  how , exactly ? 
   do n't you think printing the hard truth has better sales ? 
  does `` hard truth '' change ? 
  the one-sided rhetoric has changed from being pro-immigrant to anti-immigrant . 
  there 's lots of hate and malice in this thread . 
  lots of people asking their governments to `` do something '' about the problem . 
  what , exactly ? 
  the migrant crisis is an unsolved conundrum . 
  even if you leave aside the moral aspect of not granting them asylum , which is [ a basic human right ] ( http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm ) , you 're still left with the logistics problem . 
  do you deny them entry and leave them to drown in their improvised boats ? 
  do you grant them dock only to send them back and have your ships turned away by libyan coastguards for trespassing in their territorial waters ? 
  they actually shoot at boats that try to come back . 
  do you take them in and try to integrate them ? 
  the point here is that , while everyone is asking their governments for solutions , nobody has actually found a viable solution . 
  so far , the best solution is to take them in . 
  even so , lots of them die on their trip . 
  if you do n't , you end up like australia who has mandatory detention facilities to incarcerate them against their will . 
  concentration camps , essentially . 
  [ offshore detention : australia 's recent immigration history a ` human rights catastrophe ' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/13/offshore-detention-nauru-immigration-history-human-rights ) if you do not care what happens to them , then this is the best solution . 
  it 's still not cheap and you will be sanctioned by other states for infringing human rights on a massive scale . 
  do you see why this is a very delicate problem ? 
  the guy 's speech spills out empty and vague `` pro-justice '' promises while trying to take away the system 's independence . 
   `` in the elections , poles trusted law & justice , and we fulfill our promises '' by nominating judges to our own liking . 
  great logic , bro . 
  erdogan and putin are jelly . 
  [ it 's friday . 
  how many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today ? 
  they are an environmental & aesthetic disaster . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/239088515122614272?lang=en ) [ why does nobody know about trump 's vlog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy-k3cve3wc ), 
  the media is always one-sided because money . 
  they print whatever the people want to read in order to sell copies . 
  how is the media treating this topic now if not by being one sided and only feeding the anti-refugee rhetoric ? 
  people literally jump to conclusions and call out every car accident as being a terrorist attack before actually looking at the police reports . 
  and every refugee crime is treated as an international tragedy while ignoring the fact that most of these crimes happen inside asylum centers which offer bad living conditions and are nothing more than slums . 
  why is n't anybody reporting on these facts ? 
  because the media always has one-sided coverage . 
   the handling of the crisis was not the best . 
  i mean , the troika seriously misjudged the impact of austerity measures on greek economy the eu gave them the money , but greece decided what to do with it . 
  those that complain about the eu are split into two groups : those that say the eu is doing too much and those that say the eu is n't doing enough . 
  surprisingly , these people complain about the same things . 
  the truth is neither of them are right . 
  the eu ca n't force a country to do anything . 
  it lays out guidelines and it applies sanctions if the voluntary commitments are n't met . 
  this rarely happens only after several extensions of the deadlines . 
  it 's a very lenient system that leaves little to blame on the eu . 
  people still manage to do it because it 's easier to blame someone else for your own problems .
