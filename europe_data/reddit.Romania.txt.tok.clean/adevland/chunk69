   but also the `` troika '' ( imf , european commission , european central bank ) yeah , you did n't say anything about this . 
  are you blaming the eu for greece 's own problems ? 
  how is the eu to blame for giving greece money that they asked for ? 
   no , i clarified my point by commenting that on this particular issue the eu is on same side as trump . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm right because i said so because i said so . 
  great logic only getting better . 
  / s  your head must be hurting so much now . 
  this is when frustration kicks in and you 're pulling out the vague insults . 
  how very nice of you . 
   however , all the `` rescue package '' deals have not worked in favour for greece either . 
  you 're actually expecting them to pay back the loans . 
  you 're being naive . 
  they will pay back part of the money , then it will all be dismissed by the eu as a gesture of good will . 
  the loans , as they stand , have a very low interest rate which is more of a reminder that it 's not free money , but also not a way for germany and friends to get rich on the back of greece . 
  people either say that germany sucked all the money from greece , or , like you , they say that germany was at a loss and that greece has to pay it all back . 
  again , you 're being naive . 
   no , he took my original comment to mean that i think that the eu and trump are on the same side on every issue , so i clarified that i think they are in the same side on this particular issue . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6p72ub/brussels_prepares_to_bite_back_at_us_over_russia/dknfazc/ ) 's your original comment . 
   lol , the eu and trump are on the same side . 
  r/europe is so confused right now . 
  you did n't clarify it , you moved the goal post when you were proven wrong . 
  trump and the eu are also not on the same side of `` this particular issue '' because the eu is n't against the sanctions . 
  the eu already has its own sanctions in place . 
  the eu gave the us a warning as to not exclude them or others from negotiating the sanctions because they may have unwanted implications . 
  read the reuters article which , unlike politico , has the full quotes from junkers . 
  you were proven wrong , moved the goal post , then proven wrong again . 
   no , i clarified my point as reading comprehension is clearly not your strong suit . 
  you clarified it how ? 
  by saying that you 're right and i 'm wrong ? 
  great argument , bro . 
   i 'm sorry that reading comprehension is not your thing . 
  lol , what ? 
  you moved the goal post after being confronted with the official eu statements from `` they are on the same side '' to `` on this particular issue they are on the same side '' and i 'm the one with reading comprehension problems ? 
   on this particular issue they are on the same side , sorry if that hurts your sensibilities . 
  `` on this particular issue '' is not the same as `` on the same side '' . 
  i 'm sorry if basic logic `` hurts your sensibilities '' . 
   they are both against these particular sanctions , as they stand . 
  that puts them on the same side , at least for now . 
  the eu is n't against the sanctions . 
  the eu is against the us upholding sanctions without discussing them with other nations . 
  http://in.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-sanctions-eu-idinb5n1gq01r  brussels , july 22 ( reuters ) - the european union sounded an alarm on saturday about moves in the u.s. congress to step up u.s. sanctions on russia , urging washington to keep coordinating with its g7 partners and warning of unintended consequences . 
  also , if two people are against something , that does n't put them `` on the same side '' . 
   it 's part of europe . 
  false . 
   turkey , by land mass , is positioned 95 % in asia and 5 % in europe . 
  http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/is-turkey-in-europe-or-asia.html  the people living in turkey are not european though . 
  and they do not have european values . 
  my point exactly . 
  yet , somehow , over 19000 of them managed to integrate into stuttgart society without disrupting european culture and values . 
  the same goes for all of europe . 
   i have more right to live here than they do . 
  it 's my country and i can invite them to stay here if i like them , and i can say good bye if i do n't . 
  i do n't like them . 
  how is it your country ? 
  what gives you that right ? 
  you have no right to refuse asylum to refugees . 
  it 's a basic human right upheld by constitutions in eu countries . 
  you can deny access to immigrants that do not come for war torn or impoverished countries based on immigration policies that have been in place long before the 2015 crisis . 
   you also conveniently exclude the huge part of non-western immigrants that do not want education , work or safety . 
  they are refugees from war torn and impoverished countries . 
  below from [ the universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm ) . 
   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution, 
   yes it did . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm right because i say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
   the eu and trump are on the same side trump is against the sanctions . 
  always was . 
  this is probably the only thing he never flip-flopped on . 
  the senate is forcing trump to sign them . 
  if he does n't , it will look bad in the on-going elections investigation . 
  he 's doing it to save face , just like he bombed that syrian airfield without making any significant damage . 
  it 's a publicity stunt . 
  the eu is n't against the sanctions . 
  they are urging the us to discuss them so that unwanted consequences are avoided . 
  it goes beyond russian gas pipes . 
   it 's based on europe immigration , not on immigration from the outside world  original comment ^ is turkey in europe ? 
  does turkey have european values ? 
  most immigrants from stuttgart , over 19000 , are from turkey . 
  stuttgart has over 40 % of it 's population with migrant descent . 
  was stuttgart invaded by turkish or muslim values ? 
  it was n't , even though turkish immigrants have lived there for most of their adult lives . 
   i specificly linked to a ban on muslim immigration . 
  read what i said above regarding stuttgart . 
   no , they 're not ?? 
  how are people different ? 
  what makes you better than an immigrant that wants education , work and safety ? 
  the only difference is that you were born in different places . 
  how does that make you superior ? 
  it does n't . 
   there is a difference between western immigration and non-western immigration . 
  something your numbers do not cover . 
  the last immigrant wave happened when yugoslavia went to war and broke apart . 
  people lost their shit then because `` eastern european immigrants will leech off our country '' . 
  i like it especially how you ignore this and the fact that in cities like stuttgart , which have over 40 % of the population with migrant descent , most immigrants are from turkey , a non-western country . 
  you moved the goal post from `` immigrants are bad '' to `` some immigrants are bad '' . 
  all people are the same . 
  they immigrate in search of a better life , not because they want to `` leech '' off your country or because they want to change your `` culture '' . 
  they want decent jobs and safety . 
  that is all . 
  inb4 : they are stealing our jobs !,
