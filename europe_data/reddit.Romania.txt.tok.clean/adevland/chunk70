  where will the goal post move next ? 
   the 2015 crisis convinced the majority that this is not beneficial . 
  no , the 2015 brexit and french election fake news propaganda is what convinced many people that immigrants are their enemy . 
  the figures say otherwise . 
   some anti-immigration groups argue foreigners are a drain on a country 's economy , as they seek to avail themselves of government services before contributing to the state themselves . 
  but germany has a long history of outsiders representing a net positive for the country 's economy . 
  ** the 6.6 million people living in germany with foreign passports paid $ 4,127 more in taxes and social security on average than they took in social benefits in 2012 -- generating a surplus of 22 billion euros that year ** , according to one report . 
  http://fortune.com/2015/09/08/germany-migrant-crisis/ and here 's the report that says this : http://www.zew.de/en/das-zew/aktuelles/der-beitrag-von-auslaendern-und-kuenftiger-zuwanderung-zum-deutschen-staatshaushalt/ immigration is a long-term investment . 
  prosperous cities like stuttgart that have over 40 % of their population with a migrant descent are a living testament for this . 
   you 're clearly wrong . 
  this is the same across europe . 
  how am i wrong ? 
  those stats do n't even cover 2015 . 
  they cover the [ 2001 , 2011 ] time interval . 
  ** there was no immigrant crisis in 2011 . 
  ** you either did n't understand what i said or you have no idea about what you 're talking . 
  the point was that people started hating immigrants with a passion after the 2015 migrant crisis . 
  they blame immigrants for all their problems . 
  these problems did n't start in 2015 . 
  immigrants have existed in europe before the 2015 crisis . 
  ** people are using immigrants as scapegoats . 
  i 'm pretty sure they did n't withdraw it from the local turkish news , which is what really matters to erdogan & friends . 
  also , their motivation for withdrawing it is a copy & paste rhetoric from the russian manual on public manipulation : if you fuck up and are caught , claim it was a `` communication error '' . 
   turkey 's interior minister told his german counterpart in a telephone call on monday that ankara 's submission of the list through interpol stemmed from `` a communications problem , '' spokesman tobias plate told a regular government news conference . 
  somebody clearly made that 700 item list out of error . 
  / s tl ; dr : erdogan does n't want angry investors , just angry voters that blame the investors . 
   that does n't mean recovery , it can even mean a deeper recession . 
  it 's fixing your budget , though , which is something at least . 
  the budget is what started the mess in the first place because the greek government lied about external loans and deficit figures . 
  you know what deficit means , right ? 
  it 's the opposite of surplus . 
  a budget surplus , if maintained , means that greece managed to fix the root cause of the problem that put them in the mess in the first place and this is exactly what they were supposed to do . 
  the eu removed greece from the budget deficit watch list because of this . 
  this means more companies are going to trust greece more . 
  and this will soon translate in actual benefits for the average greek . 
  [ greece applauded for budget cuts as investors warm to its bills ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/eu-is-said-to-acknowledge-that-greece-put-budget-house-in-order )  greece 's budget has been formally declared compliant with with european union budget standards , bolstering the nation that received its latest round of rescue aid earlier this week , as it mulls its first bond sale since 2014 . 
   while largely symbolic , the decision marks an important step for greece , which has been relying on international bailouts to stay afloat since 2010 , as it seeks to return to normality and regain market access . 
  adding to signs of a brightening outlook , foreign investors bought 59 percent of the 812.5 million euros ( $ 928 million ) of three-month treasury bills the government sold on wednesday . 
   am i wrong to believe the best is also clearly behind greece ? 
  yep . 
  you 're wrong . 
  greece recorded a budget surplus of 0.7 % ( relative to gdp ) in 2016 . 
  a first since the 2008 economical crisis . 
  https://tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-budget this did n't happen with `` no recovery at all '' . 
   there 's at least two lost decades for the economy the same can be said about all countries of the world . 
  the only difference is that greece took longer to stabilize . 
  why ? 
  because the greek government falsified external debts and deficit figures and that made the 2008 crisis harder on them . 
  before people jump to conclusions , remember that  this is not a terrorist attack , say police . 
  below from a less politically biased article from reuters . 
   brussels ( reuters ) - the european union sounded an alarm on saturday about moves in the u.s. congress to step up u.s. sanctions on russia , urging washington to keep coordinating with its g7 partners and ** warning of unintended consequences ** . 
   `` we are concerned ** the measures discussed in the u.s. congress could have unintended consequences ** , not only when it comes to transatlantic/g7 unity , but also on eu economic and energy security interests . 
  this impact could be potentially wide and indiscriminate , including when it comes to energy sources diversification efforts . 
   `` sanctions are at their most effective when they are coordinated . 
  currently our sanctions regimes are coordinated . 
  as a result their impact on the ground is increased and through coordination we are able to avoid surprises , manage potential impact on our own economic operators and address collectively efforts to circumvent such measures . 
  unilateral measures would undermine this , '' the commission said . 
   `` we therefore call on the u.s. congress/authorities to engage with the partners , including the eu , to ensure coordination and to avoid any unintended consequences of the measures discussed . '', 
  [ eu sounds alarm , urges u.s. to coordinate on russia sanctions ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-eu-iduskbn1a70r3 ), 
   not a single european nation has a majority that think mass immigration has been beneficial . 
  this is besides the point . 
  the point was that a lot of these people are actually immigrants . 
  this whole anti-immigration sentiment started in 2015 with the so called `` immigrant crisis '' . 
  immigrants did n't start coming into europe in 2015 . 
  they have been here since the beginning of mankind because immigration is part of human evolution . 
  there are millions of immigrants in europe that have been living peacefully in european communities . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
   your info is outdated but i 'm not suprised when you link a discovery from 1924 . 
  [ the study you 're referring to ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/05/22/europe-birthplace-mankind-not-africa-scientists-find/ ) claims to have located an early hominid ( all those more related to us than to chimps ) in europe , but makes no claim as to whether early hominids migrated into africa from europe . 
  it also makes absolutely no claims whatsoever that humans evolved in europe . 
   the team analysed the two known specimens of graecopithecus freybergi : a lower jaw from greece and an upper premolar tooth from bulgaria . 
   retired anthropologist and author dr peter andrews , formerly at the natural history museum in london , said : `` it is possible that the human lineage originated in europe , but very substantial fossil evidence places the origin in africa , including several partial skeletons and skulls . 
   `` i would be hesitant about using a single character from an isolated fossil to set against the evidence from africa . '', 
  all evidence points to africa as being the birthplace of humanity . 
  and even if the birthplace turns out to be europe , all the other fossils from africa only prove the idea that immigration was a big part of human society from the beginning . 
   have their children bullied in german school for being german you can argue that this happens more often to immigrant kids . 
  bullying also happens all the time because of a variety of reasons . 
  countries like the us accept it . 
  i 'm from romania . 
  you rarely see bullying cases on tv . 
  when something serious happens , the teachers and parents are notified and harsh punitive measures are applied . 
  we take this seriously . 
   you are now advocating policies that might very well lead to civil wars and destruction of multiple countries in europe , if not all of europe due to ideological , racial , and religious motives . 
  immigration has been happening for thousands of years . 
  waves of immigrants always come in the wake of wars and famine . 
  cities like stuttgart have over 40 % of its population with migrant descent . 
  nobody complained about this up until 2015 when the `` migrant crisis '' started . 
  we 're all people . 
  there is no such thing as a pure european culture . 
  there are influences from all over the world that date back hundreds of years . 
  you 're trying to fight natural evolution . 
  this is the source of conflict and bullying . 
  you 're judging people based on their place of birth . 
   so what i 'm hearing is that the eu already has a company with expertise in immigration detention available ? 
  what you hear is whatever you want to hear . 
  the uk voted to leave the eu . 
  they voted to leave because they hate immigrants . 
  they are going to leave in less than 2 years .
