  ironically , an uk company profits from incarcerating immigrants in another non-eu country . 
  the eu has rules that protect human rights . 
  the uk is leaving because they do not want these rules . 
  uk politicians are blaming all of uks problems on immigrants . 
  problems that existed long before the immigrant crisis . 
   so just like the asylum centers here in europe ? 
  these are australian detention facilities . 
  people are put in them against their will and they can not leave . 
   except in our case the local population is also at risk and have been victims of countless of crimes by migrants , while australians are smart enough not to let their own citizens suffer . 
  you already acknowledged that most crimes happen inside the asylum centers . 
  how are eu citizens suffering from crimes that happen in asylum centers ? 
  cities like stuttgart have over 40 % of its population with migrant descent and no anomalous crime rates . 
  when not put in concentration camps , people can live together peacefully . 
  you put them in these camps . 
  you are now accusing them of causing crimes in these camps . 
  well , no shit , sherlock . 
  would you not be pissed for being put in a concentration camp ? 
  they are human like you and me . 
  if treated humanely , they act humanely . 
  if treated like animals , anyone would act like an animal . 
   can there be no brand of white nationalism beyond nazism ? 
  hmm . . let 's see ...  [ white nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_nationalism ) is a type of nationalism or pan-nationalism which holds the belief that white people are a race  critics argue that the term `` white nationalism '' and ideas such as white pride exist solely to provide a sanitized public face for white supremacy , and that most white nationalist groups promote racial violence . 
  i guess not . 
   they can return to the warzone any time they like they are prisoners . 
  they can not leave . 
   these camps are a generosity . 
  wow ... so much hatred ... 
  i pity you . 
   honestly , have you never heard of the raf , ira , eta , etc. ? 
  raf ? 
  the royal air force is a terrorist organization ? 
  ira = irish republican army , meaning not from the middle east . 
  eta is from spain . 
  the munich olympics attack did n't see the use of suicide bombers and neither did the iranian embassy siege in london . 
  this is not modern day terrorism . 
  the motives and means are completely different . 
   hmmm , sure do n't like the sound of that - a good thing we kept these people separated from our citizens !, 
  yeah . 
  those crimes are happening not because these people are held in concentration camps against their will , but because they are inherently violent because all immigrants are violent ? 
  / s your citizens would totally be civil if kept in concentration camps . 
  they would love it !, 
  / s i 'm sorry for saying this , but i hope you get to see the interior of one of those concentration camps as a detained immigrant in order to get a better image of what you 're proposing . 
  this discussion is over . 
   you ca n't make either an absolute statement or an accurate statement about an individual so you 're going to assume that they 're all criminals . 
  great logic , bro . 
   hence why i propose a png/australia style solution . 
  mandatory immigrant detention camps ? 
  what could go wrong ? 
  / s [ offshore detention : australia 's recent immigration history a ` human rights catastrophe ' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/13/offshore-detention-nauru-immigration-history-human-rights )  since offshore processing was restarted in 2001 , it has grown into an internationally condemned , secretive regime , subject to hundreds of court cases in australia and overseas . 
   inside the centres there have been ** violent deaths , horrific acts of self-harm and abuse , and mass protests ** . 
  sounds lovely . 
  you should visit . 
  maybe even move there since you like the idea so much . 
   yeah , but they 're not refugees . 
  you just moved the goal post . 
   the whole developing world ca n't be refugees . 
  syria is a war torn country . 
  most of the middle east is . 
  africa is the same . 
  civil war and hunger drive people away . 
   and even if they were , we could n't let them in - simply not economically feasible . 
  germany has the most refugees out of all the eu countries and , despite that , it 's the biggest economy in the union with a budget surplus holding for the last 3 years . 
  how are you suffering because of immigrants ? 
  you are n't . 
  if not for tabloid propaganda , you would n't even care . 
   the choice is up to them : are you actually fleeing a warzone ? 
  then any place is better . 
  did you visit them or are you talking out of your ass ? 
  are you running from `` violent deaths , horrific acts of self-harm and abuse , and mass protests '' ? 
  welcome to mandatory detention camps where we deprive you of freedom and you get `` violent deaths , horrific acts of self-harm and abuse , and mass protests '' . 
   it was also already happening before the 1990s . 
  name one major islamic terrorist attack from the 80s . 
  you ca n't deny refugees asylum . 
  it 's a basic human right . 
  below from [ the universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm ) . 
   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution [ libyan coastguard opened fire at refugee boats : ngos ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/libyan-coastguard-opens-fire-migrant-boats-ngos-170525100451559.html )  when the libyans pointed their weapons at us , asking us to give them all our money and cell phones and telling us to jump in the water , we did what they said . 
  i was not afraid . 
  ** i preferred to die at sea than being pushed back and to die in libya ** read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   they know the risk of getting to europe , still they go on . 
  they are n't victims , they are also guilty .

  ** i preferred to die at sea than being pushed back and to die in libya ** this discussion is over . 
   except that 's not what 's going on . 
  are you saying they are rich and travelling on improvised boats across the sea just for fun ? 
   they 're purposefully getting close to potential rescue vessels , scuttling their ship and hoping the rescuers are stupid enough to bring them to eu . 
  they sink their own boats ? 
  really ?

   you do n't agree this is putting political strain on the eu and sowing discontent ? 
  i agree . 
  but how is this the eu fault ? 
  how are they supposed to act without sowing more discontent while also not killing people by sending them away ? 
  it 's a complicated issue .
