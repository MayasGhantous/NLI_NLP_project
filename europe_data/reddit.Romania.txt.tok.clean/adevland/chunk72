  it 's easy to judge . 
  it 's not that easy to figure out a viable solution . 
   do you think the west and east would trust each other more if they did n't have to address this issue ? 
  yes . 
   do you think importing outside cultures without rhyme or reason wo n't drive up nationalism ? 
  the `` importing outside cultures without rhyme or reason '' rhetoric is what 's driving up nationalism and xenophobia . 
  they are not `` imported '' . 
  that 's false propaganda . 
  they come here from war torn and impoverished countries . 
  this has always happened during times of war . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   but its simple logic that improving the chances of success for the smugglers will lead to more smuggling . 
  that 's not the point . 
  you ca n't blame the actions of the smugglers on the ngos that are trying to help those that are being smuggled . 
   yes i do , that 's exactly why i said terrorism was a thing before 2003 . 
  the gulf war started in 1990 . 
  al-qaeda started their terror attacks in 1992 . 
   on december 29 , 1992 , the terrorist group al-qaeda detonated a bomb at the gold mohur hotel in aden , yemen , where united states marine corps would be staying while on their way to somalia to participate in operation restore hope . 
   what do you call people that make a claim and instead of backing up that claim , attack the person ? 
  do you feel insulted , bro ? 
  why ? 
  because i asked you your age ? 
   in this context , comparing me to a 6 year-old is quite ironic  so i 'm the 6 year old because i actually bring arguments backed up by facts ? 
  i 'm more and more convinced that you are a 6 year old . 
  either that or a troll .

  [ offshore detention : australia 's recent immigration history a ` human rights catastrophe ' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/13/offshore-detention-nauru-immigration-history-human-rights )  since offshore processing was restarted in 2001 , it has grown into an internationally condemned , secretive regime , subject to hundreds of court cases in australia and overseas . 
   inside the centres there have been ** violent deaths , horrific acts of self-harm and abuse , and mass protests ** . 
   those are economic migrants and they are free to legally compete for a green card/work visa in europe . 
  they come here with nothing but their clothes from war torn and impoverished countries . 
  they are refugees .

   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution ... ...  instead of a closer libyan one did you even read the article ? 
   qassem said ** the coastguard had also exchanged fire with smugglers ** , but gave no details . 
  with smugglers , not ngos . 
   ruben neugebauer , a spokesman for sea-watch , said ** the ngo had received instruction from italy 's coastguard control center in rome that the libyan coastguard would be taking over ** `` on-scene command '' , and that ** the sea-watch ship had stopped to await further instructions ** . 
   `` without any warning , they crossed our bow on the way to the migrant boat , '' neugebauer said . 
  `` they made an extremely dangerous maneuver . 
  they nearly hit our boat , they endangered our crew . '', 
  they ngo did as they were instructed . 
  you 're confusing refugees with illegal immigrants . 
  you ca n't deny refugees asylum . 
  it 's a basic human right .

   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution, 
   they do n't have a `` right to refuge '' . 
  that does n't even exist .

   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution, 
   you cant compare periods of past to this what is happening right now . 
  those statistics are recent . 
  they are from 2011 . 
   there is big difference between refugee , legal immigrant and illegal immigrant . 
  yeah . 
  there is . 
  you ca n't deny refugees asylum because it 's a basic human right upheld by the constitutions of eu states . 
  you can select immigrants via immigration policies and you can deport illegal immigrants . 
   you dont need to be fucking geneticist to know that evolution occurs because the gene pool is changing but that doesnt mean you need to have immigrants for that . 
  [ africa is the cradle of humanity ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-africa-became-the-cradle-of-humankind-108875040/ ) , not europe .

   italy has even threatened to close ports and germany gassed jews during ww2 . 
  if a country does , it does n't make it right . 
   yes it does . 
  then you 're a murderer . 
   that 's the thing with citizens : you ca n't deport them . 
  you also ca n't deny refugees asylum . 
   but not enforcing the border and an invitation from certain leaders was you ca n't deny refugees asylum . 
   here is the video to show you how they breach lybian territorial waters . 
  wow !, 
  boat icons moving on a map . 
  this is undeniable evidence . 
  you 've cracked the case , bro . 
   you mean people saved by lifeguards also went there with the intention to be saved 100 % ? 
  they went there knowing other people would keep them safe . 
   did they even try ? 
  try what ? 
  breaching territorial waters near an unstable country and risk getting killed ? 
  why do n't you try it ? 
   if i have a car accident can i also ask for a transfer in usa did you get in one while going there as a refugee ? 
  is your country impoverished or at war so you can claim refugee status ? 
   so why do they race the coastguard ?

  i was not afraid . 
  i preferred to die at sea than being pushed back and to die in libya the libyans denied everything , of course . 
   bro , if we would have 500k dead we would have our shores full with dead bodies . 
  if the boat sinks near the shore , yes , this does happen .
