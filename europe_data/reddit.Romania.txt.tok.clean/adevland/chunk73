  next you 'll be telling me that soros paid them . 
  you are delusional . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_immigration_detention_facilities great idea , bro !, 
  put innocent people in concentration camps . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  it 's not like this went bad the last time it happened . 
  / s  if they never enter , they can not claim refuge in your country . 
  these detention camps are not outside australia . 
  they are all on australian territory . 
  did you even read the wiki article ? 
   australian immigration detention facilities comprise a number of different facilities throughout australia ( including one on the australian territory of christmas island ) . 
  the facilities are currently operated by serco  serco group plc is a british outsourcing company based in hook , hampshire . 
  holy shit , the irony . 
  a uk private company operates mandatory immigrant detention camps in australia . 
  the uk voted to leave the eu because of immigrants . 
  now it profits from their detention . 
   they are n't dealing with it . 
  they are hiding in the sand , hoping the problem will go away . 
  if you 're ignorant and do not know how the eu helps them , that 's your problem . 
  not knowing is never an excuse for anything . 
   the future looks bleak , and it will only get much , much worse you mean how germany has the most refugees and the strongest economy in the eu at the same time ? 
  they 've had a budget surplus for the past 3 years . 
  coincidentally , that 's exactly when the migrant crisis started . 
   you are also against ngos trafficking them all the way to europe this is false propaganda . 
  ngos are n't trafficking them . 
  ngos do not got to africa to put them in improvised boats so that they can later pick them up when they get close to europe . 
   the fact is this remains the best approach they can take until the state doesnt take the matter in its own hands . 
  the right to refuge is a basic human rights that 's upheld by the constitution of most eu states . 
   yeah that 's not what a refugee is . 
  who are you to decide ? 
  who are those guys that rented a bout ? 
  a far right that hates immigrants ? 
  oh , ok .  moreover , while their life probably improves if they come here , it 's at our expense . 
  this is highly debatable . 
  keep in mind that when you say `` our '' , you also mean other immigrants that live here and contribute just like you . 
  germany , despite having the most immigrants , also has a huge budget surplus and towns like stuttgart with a high immigrant percentage within the population . 
  immigrants are just people . 
  if you educate them , they work and live just like you and me . 
  why does it matter if they came here after they were born ? 
  why do people get angry when they get jobs and education ? 
  do n't you get the same thing ? 
  oh , you born here ? 
  why does that matter ? 
  it does n't matter because we 're all human . 
   no they do n't tl ; dr : you 're wrong because i say so . 
  how old are you , mate ? 
  this feels like talking to a 6 year-old . 
   dude really ? 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   you do not have an obligation to drop them off where they wanted to go but to the nearest port which is in europe because these ngos are based in europe and are not allowed to enter african territorial waters . 
   let 's not kid ourselves , there are n't really any refugees coming across the mediterranean anymore . 
  the authorities have said so themselves . 
  so why the huge anti ngo backlash ? 
   but the ngos are using flares and other communications to facilitate smugglers . 
  holy shit !, 
  the ngos are using flares !, 
  they are the smugglers because only smugglers use flares !, 
   then they will stop making the trip and less people will die in the end . 
  because there 's nothing that solves an immigration crisis better than standing by and watching people die . 
   are planning on going there , picking up the migrants who have scuttled their ship , but instead of going to eu they go back to libya in order to deny thousands of people the right to refuge . 
   how is this a bad thing ? 
  how would you feel if , while fleeing from war and poverty , some asshole would take you prisoner and return you to those from whom you were fleeing ? 
   picking them up and returning them to closest port ( libya ) seems fine . 
  read the article . 
   it was unclear whether libyan authorities would willingly work with the group or allow them to enter ** territorial waters ** . 
  the ngo are based in europe . 
  they do not enter libyan territorial waters . 
   xenophobia is on the rise because many of europe 's muslims are ** tribalist shits ** for the most part . 
  you do realize that what you just said is highly xenophobic , right ? 
   and our idiot leaders are importing millions more of them . 
  because them coming here out of their own will means that your leaders imported them . 
  yep . 
  a great example of tabloid propaganda . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
   europe as a civilizational and cultural juggernaut has existed for thousands of years . 
  [ africa is the cradle of civilization ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-africa-became-the-cradle-of-humankind-108875040/ ) , bro , not europe . 
  all humans initially came from the african continent . 
   has almost nothing to do with immigration . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   anyone can do it . 
  if you rent a boat to take refugees back to africa , you 're intentionally denying them the right to refuge . 
  that 's a basic human right . 
  it 's written in the constitution of eu states . 
   if a finnish ship picks up shipwrecked people in the pacific ocean , they do n't have to carry them all the way back to finland no . 
  they carry them to the nearest port . 
  in this case , the nearest port is in europe . 
  there 's also the issue of african territorial waters and the region 's instability . 
  it 's more dangerous to take them back , even if you take them back on purpose . 
   the group told german media they planned to bring armed security to ward off any retribution from people smuggling groups . 
  they 're risking their lives in order to deny people the right to refuge . 
   the article also says that the activity of ngo improves the chances of success for the smugglers and therefore encourages smuggling . 
  that 's an alleged piece of information that came from the far right groups .
