  read the article . 
   their mission was motivated in part by ** claims ** that ngo rescue missions in the mediterranean had emboldened smuggling groups , which were sending off increasingly unseaworthy ships in the knowledge they would be rescued and taken to italy . 
  people that claim this are from far right groups . 
  it 's like saying that field medics are emboldening wars because they keep providing medical care to wounded soldiers . 
  you have to be a special kind of asshole to even suggest this . 
   and ? 
  the eu 's freedom of movement principle is for countries in the agreement . 
  the point was that the eu has a lot of non-eu immigrants that are part of european culture . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** . 
  of these , 31.4 million ( 6.3 % ) were born outside the eu and 16.0 million ( 3.2 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  and this is based on data from 2011 . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   what 's happening in the mediterranean is illegal people smuggling . 
   do n't conflate the two , they 're not the same . 
  i never said they are . 
  immigrants need to follow immigration policy . 
  these are not immigrants . 
  they are refugees . 
  you ca n't deny them asylum because it 's a basic human right . 
  it 's written in the constitution of these countries . 
   it 's not like there are sources that detail this . 
  / s sources that everybody accused of meddling with the voting process and the final count ? 
  [ turkey referendum : erdo\u011fan wins vote amid dispute over ballots -- as it happened ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/apr/16/turkey-referendum-recep-tayyip-erdogan-votes-presidential-powers )  a majority of german turks clearly are n't . 
  a majority that 's based on a vote that has been proven not to be reliable because the voting and counting process was made by turkish government officials . 
  also , if turks in germany are pro dictatorships , how come nobody has talked about this until now ? 
  the turkish referendum vote is the only `` documented '' instance of this ever happening . 
  you rarely , if ever , see any neo-nazi turkish groups . 
  most of them are white and german born . 
  also , this discussion was about how well they integrated into german society and not about their political views . 
  you moved the goal post from `` immigrants are dangerous '' to `` immigrants vote for dictatorship in another country '' based on the voting system from that dictatorship . 
  it 's an irrelevant and unreliable argument . 
   i did n't call them terrorists . 
  i 'm just calling you a bullshitter who says they 've adapted to german culture when in actuality they 're supporting their strong islamist leader . 
  the dictator counted the votes , bro . 
  you 're using a dictator 's rhetoric to prove that people love him . 
  just let that sink in for a moment . 
  it 's like saying that north koreans that live in germany love their great leader because that 's what the vote count says ; and the votes were counted by the great leader . 
  how reliable is this information ? 
   i do n't think you should equate people who come here illegally with people who come here through legal channels or people who come here as ( real ) refugees . 
  how are they not refugees ? 
  they come from war-torn and/or poverty stricken countries with nothing more than the clothes on their backs . 
   or performing any kind of medical service whatsoever . 
  saving people from drowning and treating them for starvation , dehydration and prolonged sun exposure has nothing to do with any medical treatment . 
   stopping them is a good thing stopping hungry and dehydrated and denying them care is a good thing ? 
   no matter what they choose to call themselves murderers . 
   yes , and one of our problems is mass immigration . 
  i wish our politicians started dealing with it . 
  they are dealing with it . 
  it 's just not easy to solve . 
  people always complain but never bother to actually try and solve it besides the whole `` kick them out '' rhetoric . 
  it 's a complicated issue . 
   no important european society is founded , based , or even has immigration as an important part of our culture . 
  read the [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#comparison_with_other_european_union_countries ) . 
   according to eurostat 47.3 million people lived in the european union in 2010 , who were born outside their resident country which corresponds to ** 9.4 % of the total eu population ** .

  and this is based on data from 2011 . 
  these numbers are constantly growing because people from europe leave europe while others come into europe . 
  immigration is a natural part of human evolution . 
  it has always been . 
   and we can process them outside of europe and contain the actual refugees in safe zones to keep them and us safe . 
  they have no right to anything but refuge . 
  how do you even contain them outside of europe ? 
  by letting them drown on the sea ? 
  we 're sorry to inform you that your refugee status application has been rejected because you died during last night 's sea storm . 
  / s if someone seeks refuge in europe you actually have to let them in in order to give them refuge . 
  if you deny them entry , you deny them refuge . 
  you deny them a basic human right which is upheld by the constitution . 
  you 're talking about things that you do not understand and you 're spreading misinformation . 
   but ngos like medics are the one that are encouraging them ... by saving their lives . 
   so the ngo are partly cause of their deaths . 
  lol , what ? 
  how are ngos to blame for smugglers being pieces of shit and sending people off on the sea on improvised boats ? 
  if someone is profiting from your kindness , it 's not your fault . 
  this is the same logic that blames women when they are raped by men who claim they could n't help it because they were wearing `` revealing '' clothes . 
   nope . 
  again - all i 've said is that their statement was accurate . 
  they said immigrants are deadly . 
  so did you . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6oml10/defend_europe_identitarians_charter_a_ship_to/dkiksos/ `` at least 1 '' does n't mean that immigrants are `` deadly '' . 
   after thousands of europeans have been attacked/raped/murdered . 
  tens of thousands more are being attacked/raped/murdered by their own compatriots . 
  shall we deport them as well ? 
   talk about shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted . 
  deportations have been happening long before the 2015 immigrant crisis . 
  immigration policies were n't invented 2 years ago . 
   `` at least 1 '' is all my statement implies . 
  `` at least 1 '' immigrant committed crimes , so we should deport them all , right ? 
  it 's the same shitty logic , bro . 
  you should still be deported . 
   everyone who has no legal right to be here should be deported , and those who are refugees should be kept in safe contained areas to prevent any europeans being harmed/killed . 
  guess what ? 
  this is already happening . 
  illegal immigrants are deported while refugees sit in refugee camps . 
  most crime you hear about in the news , that is related to refugees , happens inside refugee camps . 
   it 's based on europe immigration , not on immigration from the outside world . 
  what is `` the outside world '' ? 
  turkey is both in europe and asia . 
  by land mass alone , 95 % of turkey is in asia while only 5 % is in europe .
