  let me guess , `` they 're not gon na pass '' , right ? 
  ** then why are they trying to pass them ? 
   you 're the one trying to pin all of the blame on the us . 
  actually , i never said they were the only ones to blame . 
  why are you assuming this . 
  i told you that the us was n't alone . 
  most of the military operations in the middle east were organized and made by multi-national coalitions with the us being the country with the most guns . 
   terrorism began long before 2003 you know ? 
  both sides during the cold war used it extensively , it 's not exactly new . 
  the invasion of iraq was not the first time the us waged war in the middle east . 
  remember the gulf war ? 
  remember afghanistan ? 
   france chose to fuck up on libya on its own accord . 
  if you 're referring to the 2011 military actions , france was not the only state to participate . 
  [ 2011 military intervention in libya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya )  on 19 march 2011 , a multi-state nato-led coalition began a military intervention in libya , ostensibly to implement united nations security council resolution 1973 . 
   from the beginning of the intervention , the initial coalition of belgium , canada , denmark , france , italy , norway , qatar , spain , uk and us expanded to nineteen states , with newer states mostly enforcing the no-fly zone and naval blockade or providing military logistical assistance . 
   majority still goes to turkey though . 
  statistics say otherwise . 
  2016 was a bad year for tourism in turkey . 
  [ turkey 's tourism industry reels from a year to forget ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/05/turkey-tourism-industry-reels-year-to-forget-istanbul-antalya ) and 2017 is n't looking too great , either . 
  [ can hotel discounts and fuel subsidies entice tourists back to turkey ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/articles/cheaper-hotel-rates-in-turkey-as-visitor-numbers-drop/ )  figures suggest that visitor numbers nosedived by 30 per cent in 2016 , to 25.4 million , the lowest level in nine years . 
   mr cavusoglu made a direct appeal to german holidaymakers , who account for 15 per cent of turkey 's visitors , but have been put off travelling to the country due to security concerns . 
  relations between germany and turkey have also been strained in recent weeks following the detention of a turkish-german journalist in istanbul . 
   `` there is no reason for our german friends to be afraid to come to turkey , '' mr cavusoglu pleaded . 
  `` turkey is as safe as germany . '' meanwhile , erdogan calls germans nazis for not allowing pro-erdogan rallies in germany , which are illegal under turkish law . 
  yep . 
  tourism is exploding in turkey right now . 
  tourists are loving it so much that some of them are n't coming back . 
   okay ? 
  but it was still a war . 
  i did n't dispute that attacking iraq was bad , my point is that the iraq war was a war . 
  and how is this relevant ? 
  the point was that they invaded a country on a false premise and that lead to the birth of modern terrorism . 
  and your response is that `` the iraq war was a war '' ? 
  you 're debating semantics . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for any discussion . 
   and this is where i come back to you not knowing enough about american politics . 
  i encourage you to look up how many actual budgets congress has passed in the past 10 years again with the `` it wo n't pass '' defense while ignoring those that wrote it in the first place . 
  why are you defending them ? 
  they are actively working on making these things real . 
  they are working on cutting the healthcare budgets . 
  people will lose their insurance while big companies will get tax cuts . 
  unless you are rich , this will also affect you . 
  why are you defending them ? 
   just imagine if someone from botswana swooped into this thread and , with a few articles found online , started lecturing you about how things work in romania . 
  if the articles were based on facts , it would be a valid discussion . 
  you 're trying to dismiss facts because a foreigner told them to you . 
  this is prejudice based on ethnicity . 
  it 's xenophobia . 
  read the articles i posted . 
  they are written based on what the gop is doing . 
  i did n't write them . 
  not that it matters , but they are written by us citizens like yourself . 
   i used to work in the senate , i know how this shit works , and i would bet all the money i have that neither trumpcare nor trump 's proposed budget will ever become law . 
  that 's besides the point . 
  my point is that these bills should n't have been proposed in the first place . 
  you 're defending them by saying that they wo n't pass . 
  this is a shitty argument . 
  instead of improving healthcare , the gop and trump are actively trying to destroy it for the benefit of big companies . 
  and you 're ignoring this . 
  why are you ignoring this ? 
  what is the purpose of these bills ? 
  why did they go through so much trouble to write and actively support them if not to make them reality ? 
   there 's no predicting what the gop of 2017 will do , but i can promise what it wo n't do , and that 's pass either trump 's proposed budget so facts do n't matter because a foreigner told them to you and what you say is true because you say so . 
  great logic , bro . 
   or he obtained one of the houses by using fake documents , according to the judge who demanded him to give the house back to the state . 
  or he legally bought them from a guy who got them from the state via fake documents . 
  [ this is the truth . 
  ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/justitie/casa-pierduta-de-iohannis-itele-unui-caz-complicat-675992 ) it 's like buying a phone from someone that stole it . 
  it 's not your fault the phone was stolen . 
  you bought it legally . 
  the police will confiscate it in order to return it to the original owner , but you can keep whatever profits you made from using it . 
  with this i can agree . 
   it 's does n't have to be forced onto the uk as if their the only ones like you want it to be , do n't undermine the issue have other countries suppressed reports on how saudi arabia is funding terrorism ? 
   that doesnt mean that the gov literally uses eu founds to critizise them they use government funds . 
  and the government gets money from the eu . 
  they also post these ads on [ trains built/renovated with eu funds ] ( https://twitter.com/murphypetern/status/848545018067513345?lang=en ) and on [ buildings built/renovated with eu funds ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/647ag1/lets_stop_brussels_next_to_funded_by_eu_with_3/ ) . 
  it 's not illegal , it 's just highly hypocritical in a `` bite the hand that feeds you '' kind of way . 
  this would n't be a problem at all if they were real criticism , but they are n't . 
  it 's anti-eu propaganda based only on fear and hate rhetoric . 
  there have been huge protests against these campaigns and against the hungarian government in hungary . 
   greece offers a little different tourist package though . 
  that 's the point . 
  people that wanted to go to turkey now go to greece because of the similarities . 
   you get a similar vacation without the hassle of been arrested and jailed for insulting erdogan in a fb post 3 years ago . 
  https://medium.com/@ndbrning/hungarys-let-s-stop-brussels-campaign-propaganda-and-xenophobia-masquerading-as-consultation-4b4181116c5e https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/world/anti-soros-posters-deepen-hungarys-conflict-eu/ hungary is literally filled with these ads right now . 
  they are part of the `` national consultation '' government campaign . 
  that 's an official government campaign with a clear anti-eu message . 
  the hungarian government receives eu funds . 
  the hungarian government is funding these anti-eu campaigns . 
  these ads are very hypocritical . 
   ( although it 's less of a political statement , more of a. . . country does n't seem too stable type decision ) the instability is directly influenced by politics . 
  the coup is suspected to have been staged so that to `` justify '' what is happening right now . 
  there is no war in history without political ramifications . 
   it was spain that got my tourism money second best option in terms of who needs it the most . 
  i agree . 
  but whataboutism is n't invalidating what the uk does . 
  this is a great opportunity for greece . 
  lots of people were already reconsidering their vacations in turkey and changing their destination to greece .
