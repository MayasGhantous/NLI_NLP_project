  this will only increase the trend . 
  that 's pretty much the same point . 
  their children , if born in germany , will likely not go through it . 
  that 's european culture at play . 
  and watch the russian spin-off take-off with blazing ratings while your original show sinks to abysmal viewing scores . 
  remember that marvel has movies planned for the next 20 or so years . 
  imagine how things work in politics . 
   it is senseless to try to start a conversation about poland/hungary holding up eu values on the money issue . 
  all it will do is invite more hostility . 
  ignoring turkey did n't work . 
  it actually encouraged others to do the same . 
  it 's not about extreme measures , it 's about proportional sanctions . 
   you do n't have to bring money to the table , you can just point out what and how they 're intentionally doing wrong and say `` well , you either stop this or we will vote for sanctions '' . 
  the money point was metaphoric because everyone understands it . 
  not everyone understands the other benefits because most eu skeptics will say that they do not use nor do not care about freedom of movement or the other benefits that do not directly influence them . 
  macron could have listed them all , but it would have diluted the point . 
  the eu is helping these countries with money and other benefits while also profiting from them from trade and cheap labor . 
  these are mutual benefits because those cheap salaries are above average in countries like poland and hungary . 
  ** the point is that if you want the cake , you have to work for it . 
  ** poland and hungary are now on strike while they also keep getting their rations of cake . 
  this is not ok . tl ; dr : ** it 's not just about money . 
  people are taking the quote literally while ignoring the context . 
  people read this as `` refugees mutilating the genitals of german women '' . 
  it actually reads as `` refugees mutilating the genitals of refugee women '' . 
  adapting to a host country 's culture takes time but it does happen . 
  look at prosperous cities like [ stuttgart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuttgart#immigrants ) that have over 40 % of the population with migrant descent . 
  most immigrants in stuttgart , over 19 000 of them , are from turkey . 
  this is n't the first time when europe was `` besieged '' by immigrants . 
  and somehow , the european culture always prevails . 
  macron asked poland and hungary to explain why they are giving up on their eu pledges while poland and hungary ask macron to explain why he 's asking them for explanations . 
  it 's a diversion tactic . 
  look at me ? 
  no , look at you !, 
   turn their back on europe and have a cynical approach to the union which gives them money this is a valid point if you consider how hungary is literally using eu money to pay for anti-eu propaganda . 
  you also can not expect to keep all of the eu benefits while you slowly stop upholding eu principles . 
  that 's what the uk is doing , but they at least opted for brexit . 
  poland and hungary are doing the same thing while cashing in on all the eu benefits . 
  this is n't fair for any of the other members that actually uphold eu principles . 
   this is a simplistic view of how the european union works it 's not just about the money . 
  it 's about all eu member benefits . 
  you ca n't have them if you stop upholding your eu pledges . 
  the race is on . 
  turkey , watch out !, 
  there 's a new dictator on the block . 
  leave the eu . 
  hold an early election and lose majority . 
  form new one with the dup . 
  suppress saudi arabia terrorism report . 
  make mandatory id checks for watching porn . 
  what do you think will happen in the next episode of the marmite mumble jumble ? 
   you really think that congress is just going to agree to the budget , just because 52 of 100 senators are republican ? 
  do you really think they wo n't ? 
  it 's their budget . 
  trump proposed it . 
  they have a majority . 
  these are facts . 
  your only defense is saying that it may not pass . 
   you should ask him how that sent his healthcare bill . 
  the first one did n't pass . 
  now they have a second which is almost identical to the first . 
  they 'll amend it until it passes . 
  the same goes for the budget . 
   again , not only are you wrong , you apparently do n't know enough about how politics works here to realize how odd-base you are what i 've said are facts . 
  it 's their budget . 
  trump proposed it . 
  they have a majority . 
  these are facts . 
  what you said is only a supposition . 
  ** you 're assuming that they wo n't pass a bill and a budget that they wrote . 
  ** this is no defense . 
  this is grasping for straws . 
  a few months ago this was `` do you really think they 'll cut the budget for healthcare ? 
  trump promised not to . '' . 
  well , here it is . 
  a budget and a healthcare bill that will cut budgets for healthcare . 
  just keep moving the goal post and ignoring facts . 
   but gdp does not account for income distribution . 
  gdp does n't . 
  [ gdp adjusted by ppp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) ( ** purchasing power ** parity ) does . 
   deviations from parity imply differences in purchasing power of a `` basket of goods '' across countries , which means that for the purposes of many international comparisons , countries ' gdps or other national income statistics need to be `` ppp-adjusted '' and converted into common units . 
   that 's like saying ww2 was n't a war because germany invaded poland for no good reason . 
  germany was punished for invading poland . 
  the us was n't . 
  [ legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legitimacy_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq )  furthermore , the security council may only authorise the use of force against an `` aggressor '' in the interests of preserving peace , whereas ** the 2003 invasion of iraq was not provoked by any aggressive military action ** . 
  it was all based on the false assumption that iraq had chemical weapons . 
  there were no chemical weapons . 
  the us invaded iraq on a false premise . 
  ** the 2003 invasion of iraq was not provoked by any aggressive military action . 
   just because the cause of the war was dubious does n't somehow make it not a war . 
  the hell would you call it , `` the iraqi emergency '' ? 
  read the wikipedia article . 
  the war in iraq was preceded by the ** invasion ** of iraq . 
   the 2003 ** invasion ** of iraq lasted from 20 march to 1 may 2003 and signalled the start of the iraq war there was no emergency . 
  there was an invasion . 
   sure . 
  france never had anything to do with libya . 
  the uk had nothing to do with iraq . 
  they were all us allies in us wars . 
  the us did n't invade iraq all by itself . 
  it was a coalition of 35 countries .
