  i do n't care , and sure there are people out there who are the same . 
  so you lost money , admitted to it , and you 're now calling it satire ? 
   satire is the use of humour , irony , exaggeration , or ridicule to expose and criticize people 's stupidity or vices , particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues . 
  you came close . 
  the admission does criticize your stupidity on a decision involving a contemporary issue . 
   the part where you `` refuse to sell at a loss '' is delicious . 
  it puts the whole `` crying into my money '' thing into perspective . 
  cheers and ... good luck , i guess . 
   yah i 'll go back to crying ~ ~ into ~ ~ ** about ** my money lol . 
  [ you were n't joking .

  top kek . 
   that about sums up how useless this whole conversation was . 
  you agreed , so it 's over . 
   what part of speculative are you failing to grasp ? 
  bitcoin is n't the only commodity that 's being speculated on the market . 
  it is , however , one of the only highly volatile ones . 
  all crypto-currencies are . 
  why ? 
  because they 're not regulated and are primarily used in speculative transactions and illegal activities . 
  there is no other big market using them . 
  and there will never will be as long as it 's unregulated and highly volatile . 
   you realize most sane people do n't expect btc to become the de-facto global currency so you agree that it 's only a fad and that it will get replaced by another crypto-currency . 
   that sounds a lot like a ponzi scheme . 
   and while it did sow the seeds of the iraq war , the us still won . 
  you must be really proud to have defeated 1 single country with the help of 34 others . 
  also , thanks for all the terrorism . 
   their system is just piss-poor like your points , and that money mostly goes to big pharma , but that 's another question . 
  exactly . 
  the real investment is minimal . 
  the money does n't go into healthcare , it goes into corporate hands via hugely inflated prices . 
  they call it the `` open market '' . 
  they also call universal healthcare a `` communist '' idea and reject it every single time because of big pharma lobbying ( legal bribes ) . 
  the whole us approach to healthcare is one big `` fuck you '' message to the average us citizen who just ca n't afford to be part of it . 
   it 's like saying the battle of verdun is not war , it 's just a battle . 
  this is a shitty example because the battle of verdun was not an invasion motivated by a false pretext . 
  it was part of ww1 . 
  meanwhile , the us invaded iraq under the pretext of them having chemical weapons which they did not find after 18 months of searching . 
  they found no chemical weapons but brought instability in the region and sparked the creation of modern terrorism and isis . 
   you ca n't be this dumb ... insulting me does n't make you look smart . 
   if they had gone full british empire mode ( that is : use of concentration  camps to separate the insurgents from the population ) those wars would 've been over in a year . 
  that would have defeated the purpose which was humanitarian in nature . 
  look at iraq and how they break basic human rights . 
  let 's go and show them how to properly break basic human rights . 
  / s  also , what the fuck is this about the usa supporting the revolution !? 
  that was my mistake . 
  i edited the comment . 
   sure , the dot com market in the 80s and 90s . 
  dude , the internet is not a commodity . 
  random shitty sites are n't commodities . 
  i was n't referring to the stock market . 
  bitcoins are n't traded on the stock market . 
  point me to an actual commodity , that is traded as a stand-alone entity , that loses more than 20 % of its value in less than 3 days . 
  be it a currency , or a real world physical asset . 
   trump has signed zero laws affecting healthcare . 
  zero . 
  [ medical research , health care face deep cuts in trump budget ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/23/529654114/medical-research-health-care-face-deep-cuts-in-trump-budget ) trump proposed a budget that lowers the budget to medicaid and drafted a bill to repeal and replace obacamare . 
  while the budget is still being debated , the bill failed once and is now on course to fail again . 
   honey , trump has n't done jackshit . 
  i do n't know how you do it in your country , but `` trump tweeting shit out '' is n't actually how law is made over here . 
  these are not just tweets . 
  these things are happening right now in the us senate . 
   your point was : they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
  you talked about money . 
  never about service . 
  false . 
  i said that  they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
  then , immediately after , i said  the number one reason for bankruptcy in the us is unpaid medical bills . 
  this shows how the us , although it spends the most on healthcare , has the highest prices that people can not afford . 
  [ read it again . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6o7295/french_military_head_de_villiers_quits_over_cuts/dkf60id/ ) raw money spending is n't irrelevant if you do n't account for prices . 
  that 's why raw gdp is rarely used . 
  the more accurate value is gdp adjusted by ppp ( ** purchasing power ** parity ) . 
   so now the false political reason behind iraq is relevant to evaluate the military operation . 
  and that was n't even a war ... lol . 
  i flagged you a while ago as a `` troll '' , i see i was already right back then . 
  there were huge protests about it in the us and around the world . 
  this is not just my opinion , it 's a fact . 
  the war in iraq was not a war , it was an invasion based on a false pretext . 
  they found no chemical weapons . 
  [ 2003 ** invasion ** of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq )  since the invasion , the u.s. and british government statements concerning iraqi weapons programs and links to terrorist organizations have been discredited . 
  while the debate of whether iraq intended to develop chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons in the future remains open , no wmds have been found in iraq since the invasion despite comprehensive inspections lasting more than 18 months . 
   did you forget the gulf war , dum-dum ? 
  the us was n't alone . 
  it was a coalition of 35 countries that won the gulf war . 
  the gulf war also lead to the iraq war , which was a total failure and led to the creation of modern terrorist organizations . 
  and thanks for calling me `` dum-dum '' . 
  it really makes you look smart . 
   kindly point me to a commodity that only goes up . 
  kindly point me to a commodity that loses more than 20 % of its value in less than 3 days . 
  my point was that crypto-currencies are highly volatile and mostly unregulated . 
   in 6 years btc has gone from 11 cents to $ 3000 and you think most investors have lost money ? 
  my point is that most bitcoins are owned by few people/organizations . 
  there is no big market that uses it for anything except for speculative exchanges or illegal activities . 
   `` yo bro , you ca n't talk about anything else except refugees bro . '', 
  yo , bro , let 's talk about mickey mouse in a thread about refugees , bro . 
   i said it was illegal . 
  do you deny it is xenophobic ? 
  basic human rights specifically mention the right to asylum . 
  basic human rights apply to all people , regardless of their ethnicity or education .
