  it 's like i 'm giving you money to buy things from me . 
  this stimulates the economy and makes others buy even more . 
   `` how dare you judge a country by its education !, 
  that 's xenophobic !! '', 
  / u/adevland it actually is . 
  xenophobia is dislike of or ** prejudice ** against people from other countries . 
  below from the universal declaration of human rights . 
   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution you ca n't discriminate based on ethnicity . 
  you ca n't say the the people from one country are more educated because that 's prejudice against people from other countries which is the text-book definition of xenophobia . 
  and you ca n't pick and choose to whom you give refuge because all people have this right . 
   also do you believe that the average somalian is just as educated as an italian ? 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  this is the point . 
  all of them have the same rights for refuge under the german constitution . 
  all of them have the same capacity to learn . 
  one is not inferior to the other . 
  you ca n't pick and choose based on their levels of education because it 's illegal . 
  this is not posting a job offer and picking the most qualified . 
  these are war refugees . 
  you either give them refuge , or you do n't . 
  if you pick and choose you 'll get sanctioned by the eu for breaking [ basic human rights ] ( http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm ) . 
   article 14 right to asylum in other countries from persecution, 
   cost of living is constantly rising whilst wages have been the same for 20 years . 
  you can see where that is heading . 
  without any graphs that are based on real data , no , we ca n't see that . 
  https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp-per-capita-ppp from that graph , italy 's gdp adjusted by ppp has actually been steadily growing in the recent years . 
  true , it 's lower than it was before 2008 , but the 2008 crisis affected everyone , not just italy . 
  even greece is getting better . 
  there 's still a long way to go , but this is the right way to go . 
   just makes you look like a retard thanks for the kind words . 
  they contribute a lot to this discussion . 
   no i am assuming their education level . 
  try again . 
  it 's the same thing . 
  you 're being cornered and you 're debating semantics . 
  that 's the bottom of the barrel for any argument . 
  you 're discriminating based on ethnicity . 
  you ca n't possibly judge someone based on their ethnicity alone . 
  that 's what you do . 
  that 's text-book xenophobia . 
   there are hundreds of thousands who are imported by ngo 's across the med every year . 
  false . 
  ngos help them reach the continent but have nothing to do with them getting on the ocean/sea . 
  people smugglers from their home countries do that . 
  get your facts straight . 
   immigration is good for the the economy because it means more consumption , more spending , more people to put to work , just like your sources say . 
  i 'm glad that we finally agree at least on this point . 
   but many europeans are worried more about their culture and way of life than the economy . 
  if they break the law , you put them in jail . 
  no free passes . 
  no exceptions . 
  they have to obey the same laws as you . 
  and they have to respect your culture while you have to respect theirs . 
  this means that they can not impose their culture onto you , as long as you give them the same respect . 
  if you give them jobs and treat them equally , they will be no problem , bar the 1 % who always cause trouble regardless of their origins . 
  they have their criminals and you have yours . 
  they all have to face the same punishments for the same crimes . 
  immigration , even at this scale , is n't a new scale . 
  it always happens when wars happen . 
  most of them will go back to their countries after the wars are over . 
  some will stay and make the 40 % + base of cities like stuttgart in germany . 
   are you denying that ( mena ) immigrants have any negative impact to the society at all ? 
  all groups have bad apples . 
  the problem here is that people are focusing on the bad apples of very specific groups while ignoring the bad apples from the other groups that are way more numerous . 
  and the basis for this cherry picking is ethnicity . 
  this is bad . 
  this is text-book xenophobia . 
   are you actually going to read it ? 
  bro , why are you moving the goal post to the eu central bank ? 
  this is about germany having a budget surplus despite having the most refugees . 
  it 's not about the eu central bank . 
  you 're moving the goal post because you 've been proven wrong . 
   what 's the likelihood italy could ever pay back $ 356.6 billion ? 
  pretty slim . 
  and to whom to they owe the money ? 
  to germany . 
  and who loses if italy does n't pay back its loan to germany ? 
  italy , right ? 
  the same how greece is in the same situation but now are doing better . 
  [ greek budget in surplus for first time in 21 years ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greek-budget-in-surplus-for-first-time-in-21-years-2017-04-24 ) the eu is now the world 's second biggest economy . 
  it beat the us . 
  https://www.thebalance.com/world-s-largest-economy-3306044  the european union was in second place , generating $ 19.2 trillion . 
  together , china and the eu generate 33.9 percent of the world 's economic output of $ 119.4 trillion . 
   the united states fell to third place , producing $ 18.6 trillion . 
  i live in romania . 
  an eastern europe country . 
  even we are growing fast despite having a corrupt government that constantly tries to undermine democracy . 
  this is just fake crisis management on behalf of trump . 
  trump created a crisis , by promoting the idea that the us will retire from the paris climate agreement , so he can later change his mind and appear to be the hero that solved the crisis that was fabricated by him in the first place . 
   according to figures published by italian statistics institute istat , 1.619 m italian families were living in absolute poverty in 2016 , for a total of 4.742 m people , ** 144,000 more than in 2015 ** . 
  the article completely ignores the migrant crisis . 
  can it be that these extreme cases of poverty are actually immigrant families that arrived in italy and not actually native italian families ? 
  so , the people of italy are n't getting poor , but , rather , more poor people are coming to italy . 
   i guess you can spin it into a negative about eu whenever you want . 
  the eu is either not doing enough , and it 's forsaking the union , or too much and ultra nationalists call bloody murder . 
  both of these groups of people voted to leave the eu in the uk . 
  just let that sink in . 
   whataboutism is a propaganda technique formerly used by the soviet union in its dealings with the western world , and subsequently used as a form of propaganda in post-soviet russia . 
   it is a case of tu quoque ( appeal to hypocrisy ) , a logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent 's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument . 
   i just gave a long detailed explanation of why .
