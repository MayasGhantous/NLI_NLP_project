  a first since 2009 . :d, 
   what crisis ? 
  i do not remember :p exactly . 
  the only thing you remember is to blame the eu for everything bad that happens . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
   you can google for the 2008 crisis if you 're interested . 
  read the wikipedia article about it and greece . 
  it specifically points out how the greek government falsified and lied about loans and deficits and how that led to the recession that is still affecting them while other countries have long since recovered from the 2008 crisis . 
   why would the german government know more than the us government ( the opposite is true ) ? 
  what does the us government have to do with refugees coming to europe from the middle east and africa ? 
   you literally can not the this dense ... `` the this dense '' in stores next week . 
  buy it while stocks last . 
   the point of the analogy was to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation , by applying to another area . 
  yeah . 
  he `` knows a guy '' . 
  great analogy . 
   i do n't care about what he thinks . 
  but you care about what he writes , right . 
  you `` only read words on a screen '' . 
  his words . 
  from his mind . 
  you can argue that he did n't think them through , but you did n't do that . 
  you 're defending his words . 
   if it was ironically misunderstanding on purpose it does n't matter , since i do n't read minds , i only read words on a screen . 
  tell me more about how you do n't care , but you do enough to start another discussion just about it . 
   because accepting more refugees/migrants ( the line is quite blurry at this point ) will act as a pull factor for others in africa . 
  can you really blame people for wanting to have a better life ? 
  sure , screen them as much as you like as long as you do n't breach basic human rights . 
  border checks have been in place since at least 2015 when they announced stricter border checks . 
   then you have freedom of movement in the eu which means terrorists can select targets at their leisure after being accepted in germany . 
  most terror attacks in the eu happen via recruited members from the eu . 
  that 's people that were already living in the eu , but who joined isis via online propaganda channeled through xenophobia . 
  if you want to fight terrorism , you have to fight xenophobia . 
  terror attacks are catalysts for xenophobia which is the main recruiting force for isis . 
  because poor and uneducated people , that are being marginalized and hated , sometimes turn to extremism as a way to `` fit in '' . 
   the budget surplus is in no way thanks to refugees . 
  lots of them have jobs that pay taxes . 
  stuttgart has 40 % of the population with immigrant descent . 
  [ immigration boosts germany 's economy ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/immigration-boosts-germanys-economy/ )  an analysis of all 16 german states showed that those bundesl\u00e4nder with a high proportion of foreign workers have lower unemployment and higher levels of risk capital investment . 
  significantly more patents are filed too . 
  ... ... . .  we 're spending billions on their welfare instead of investing it in innovation or actual economic value . 
  you 've got money lying around after each year . 
  [ german budget surplus highest since 1990 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39064795 ) money is n't a problem . 
   meanwhile almost 100,000 people who we know nothing about , who have few ( if any ) skills , and who hold values at odds with our own ( requiring authorities to print flyers and hold classes on how not to sexually assault ) , arrive on our shores every 30 days . 
  what a tragedy . 
  / s fyi , stuttgart has over 40 % of its population coming from a migrant descent . 
  germany also has had a budget surplus for the last 3 years . 
   many of them are running from their empty wallets how dare they want a better life ? 
  / s  they should go in rich countries that have the same culture , like the oil rich muslim ones . 
  why ? 
  because i say so . 
   once again , everyone in europe has to suffer under germany 's ( moral ) superiority complex . 
  how exactly is `` everyone in europe '' suffering if germany continues to accept more refugees ? 
  they already have the most and a budget surplus for the past 3 years . 
  it seems like they know what they 're doing . 
  there have been public documentaries about how they work . 
  you `` know a guy '' and you 've seen a documentary ? 
  damn , that 's impressive . 
  / s and they totally went in depth about all the screenings that they do in those documentaries , right ? 
  yep . 
  you know shit , bro . 
  you know all the shit . 
   you are confusing border checkpoints and background checks for asylum applications did you just move the goal post ? 
  yep . 
  you did . 
  the articles i mentioned specifically talk about border checks . 
  either read them or this discussion is over . 
  here 's another one . 
  [ eu set to keep emergency border checks as members argue over migration ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-eu-borders-iduskcn12d0w0 )  germany , austria and sweden said on thursday that emergency ** border checks ** inside europe 's free-travel zone should ** remain in place ** after a mid-november expiry as the eu continues to argue over how to deal with an influx of refugees and migrants . 
   it 's an analogy i asked for proof , not an analogy . 
   it 's not good enough to be hunting people down after they 've entered the country when it 's next to impossible to find them among 80 million people . 
  yet they still manage to make arrests and prevent attacks . 
  you 're also ignoring the fact that lots of them are being denied entry . 
  not everyone gets in as you claim . 
   migrants are allowed to literally walk into germany this is false . 
  [ germany keeps border checks in place ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/547c69c8-1767-11e6-b8d5-4c1fcdbe169f?mhq5j=e2 ) [ germany announces indefinite border checks ] ( https://euobserver.com/migration/131936 ), 
   he is saying an airline that checks for bombs after the plane has taken off would be criminally incompetent . 
  and what relevance does this have ? 
  are there any airlines that do not do this ? 
   the analogy to countries is that the airline is germany , and the bomb checks are the migrant screening . 
  again , how is germany not screening people ? 
  he literally just said it without any proof or arguments . 
  are we supposed to take his word for it ? 
  he then said he `` knows a guy '' . 
  are you seriously defending this guy ? 
   it 's not that hard of an analogy , and your conclusions of what he meant are downright bizarre . 
  you obviously do not recognize satire when you see it . 
  maybe you should attend one of those `` reading comprehension classes '' . 
  and just in case you actually missed it , i was making fun of the guy for not bringing any facts to the discussions and for using only vague analogies while i asked for proof . 
  here 's proof in case you missed the comment chain . 
  [ germany keeps border checks in place ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/547c69c8-1767-11e6-b8d5-4c1fcdbe169f?mhq5j=e2 ) [ germany announces indefinite border checks ] ( https://euobserver.com/migration/131936 ), 
   through what magic method are they going to determine whether one of those 100 is an isis member ? 
  wait ... you mean your `` friend from another eu country '' did n't tell you ? 
  i though he did . 
  did you lie to us ? 
  seriously , though , these checks are n't public knowledge just so that people ca n't prepare for them . 
  they 're supposed to be secret . 
  your `` friend from another eu country '' should have told you this . 
   you need reading comprehension classes , because that 's evidently not what he wrote . 
  i 'll play along .
