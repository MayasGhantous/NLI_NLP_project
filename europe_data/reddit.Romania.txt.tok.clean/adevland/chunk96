  you need to have confidence in the beauty that surrounds you . 
  i 've also been to lefkada . 
  things were much more developed there when compared to corfu , even though lefkada is a smaller island . 
  when at the beach in corfu , there were very few places to rent water sports equipment . 
  lefkada had lots of them . 
  i 'm just saying that there 's a lot of potential . 
  if young people do n't want to work in tourism , that 's fine . 
  it 's not the recession 's fault if they have to leave in order to study other things besides tourism . 
   so the government decided to cancel part of the funds allocated to higher education and research . 
  actually , they did n't decide anything yet . 
  this is the only article so far that has reported this based on a budget draft . 
  it 's still unclear what will happen or what all of this means because the article also says that the education minister reassured universities and researchers that the cuts will not affect them . 
  there is lots of uncertainty at this point , so erything should be taken with a big grain of salt . 
  especially all of the toxic comments on this thread . 
   the result is still the same : the universities and schools will have 160 million less than originally planned . 
  as of now it 's still unclear . 
  this is the only article that reports it and it 's based on some budget drafts . 
  the concern is real and people should voice their disapproval , but in a calm and rational manner . 
  the comments here are very toxic . 
  yep . 
  it sounds like the government is putting money aside for universities and research while also reassuring them that the cuts wo n't affect them . 
  still , people are quickly jumping to conclusions . 
  it 's like they want education and research budgets to be cut so that they have reasons to hate the new government . 
  the article is written in a doomsday warning style . 
   the past seven years of ** crushing austerity and recession ** have caused ** rocketing levels ** of youth unemployment , where a ** suffocating atmosphere ** is fuelling depression among many young people . 
  the only real suffocating atmosphere in greece is the heat . 
  i 've recently been to greece on vacation . 
  corfu , specifically . 
  greeks are very welcoming and chill people . 
   the only university on the island teaches tourism and music . 
  this has always been the case . 
  most kids leave the island because there has never been more than that . 
  most small islands live from tourism . 
  some young people eventually leave to work elsewhere not because of the recession , but because there have never been other local options besides tourism . 
  greece is going through a recession , but things are getting better , not worse as the independent suggests from the very first paragraph . 
   as greece 's financial struggle from the crash continues to worsen and you do n't have to take my word for it . 
  [ after 8 years of austerity , greece gets eu budget approval ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/years-austerity-greece-eu-budget-approval-48585610 )  greece has been under the spotlight since 2009 when its debt crisis exploded in the wake of a statistics scandal that showed the public finances were in far worse shape than thought . 
  greece 's budget deficit was suddenly revised upward to double-digit levels and way above an eu limit of 3 percent . 
   the turnaround in the government budget has been remarkable . 
  in 2016 , greece posted a surplus of 0.7 percent compared with the peak deficit of 15.1 percent in 2009 . 
  ** it 's as if the independent read this news 2 days ago and are now countering it with fear-mongering in order to justify that brexit was a good idea . 
  **  as greece 's financial struggle from the crash continues to worsen , theresa may warns that failure to tackle the uk 's deficit could see it spiral into a ` greek-style scenario ' . 
  that 's the very first paragraph of the article . 
  they 're not even trying to be subtle about it . 
  is there any other source in english ? 
  this does seem worrisome , but consider this google translate :  as for the ministry of higher education , it is tempting : this effort of recovery will not affect '' the means of the universities nor the programs of research engaged or the campaigns of employment '' , promises the minister fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique vidal , in a communiqu\u00e9 , thursday 13 july . 
  as regards the four programs directly related to its scope ( higher education , student life , scientific and technological research and space research ) , the cancellations correspond in large part to 160 of the 180 million euros in appropriations ' been put aside as a precaution , '' she says . 
  i 'm not sure what that means . 
  i could n't find any other source in english . 
   your fact is just one single factory that is employing refugees oh , really ? 
   forty-five percent of people in stuttgart were either born abroad or are the children of immigrants . 
  traditionally , they 've come to stuttgart to work at the big companies here like mercedes , porsche and bosch . 
  ignoring facts wo n't make them go away . 
   `` do n't talk about social costs , we are only talking about financial costs and only in germany '' . 
  what you 're referring to as `` social cost '' does n't exist . 
  social cost is something else entirely . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_cost  it could n't be that they need skilled workers ? 
  yes , they do . 
  that 's why i said xenophobia is mostly the problem . 
  read the whole article , do n't cherry pick . 
  lots of people that were born in sweden are being treated as immigrants and can not get jobs . 
  that 's xenophobia . 
  that 's the real `` social problem '' . 
   it could n't be that they need people who speak fucking swedish or english ? 
  it takes less than a year to learn the language . 
  that 's not the problem . 
   jesus christ bro , you got your head so far up the migrants ass , you ca n't what 's really happening . 
  thanks for the insult . 
  it brings a lot to this discussion . 
  this discussion is over . 
   which one ? 
  yes . 
   that 's plenty more than your precious southern european nations . 
  prices are also very different . 
  for products and especially for services like healthcare and education . 
  they are much higher in the us . 
  https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/country_result.jsp?country=germany&amp;displaycurrency=usd https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/in/jackson the prices for basic food items in the poorest us state are higher than the prices in germany , the richest eu state . 
   sometimes some shops wo n't so i ask for it ( and they do ) . 
  i never did ask for one , but i will next time . 
  i like greece . 
  this was my second visit . 
   first of all , the us is the world 's largest as of 2017 where 's the sauce ? 
  2017 is n't even over . 
   i do n't understand why you think bundling more than a dozen countries together and calculating their gdp as one would be valid in most instances ? 
  the eu = european union . 
  it has a parliament , central bank and its own currency , among other things . 
   countries in the eu struggle to use a currency currently boosting germany 's economy how is this anything more than vague anti-eu propaganda ? 
  tl ; dr : i 'm right because i say so . 
  that 's not how it works , bro . 
   italy is n't looking so good , spain is doing mediocre at best how about each individual us state ? 
  [ 10 poorest states in america in 2016 ] ( http://www.benefitspro.com/2016/10/03/10-poorest-states-in-america-in-2016?page_all=1&amp;slreturn=1499958597 )  mississippi finished at the bottom last year , and nothing 's changed about that . 
  the national median income is $ 55,775 , but mississippi lagged that number by more than $ 15,000 . 
   and many mississippians understand poverty all too well ; 11.5 percent earn $ 10,000 or less annually , the highest extreme poverty rate of any state . 
  that 's not looking so good . 
  it 's well below `` mediocre '' . 
   i do n't get the point ? 
  the point is that the eu has surpassed the us economy while some people are claiming that it has a `` failing '' economy . 
  they point out greece as their example but forget that greece is only one of many members that have helped greece recover . 
  and it is recovering .
