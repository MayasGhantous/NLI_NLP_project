  greece 's budget deficit was suddenly revised upward to double-digit levels and way above an eu limit of 3 percent . 
   the turnaround in the government budget has been remarkable . 
  in 2016 , ** greece posted a surplus of 0.7 percent ** compared with the peak deficit of 15.1 percent in 2009 . 
   does romania have anything similar ? 
  [ yep .

   santa klaus will do . 
  uncle klaus is way better than daddy dragnea . 
  just saying . 
   you have to sign a contract that you will never overthrow the government . 
  is n't the contract nullified if you actually overthrow the government ? 
   sure they do . 
  any facts you can send me ? 
  i find it ironic that you 're asking for facts after failing to provide any of your own . 
  but , sure . 
  here you go . 
  [ immigrants bolster germany 's workforce ] ( https://www.marketplace.org/2016/07/12/world/integrating-immigrants-germanys-workforce )  the program in question is a 14-week `` bridge internship '' that mercedes runs . 
  wasim and 300 other refugees are working at mercedes plants across germany . 
  they 're from syria , iraq , eritrea , somalia . 
   ** forty-five percent of people in stuttgart were either born abroad or are the children of immigrants . 
  ** traditionally , they 've come to stuttgart to work at the big companies here like mercedes , porsche and bosch . 
  ... . .  in sweden and norway , foreigners are three times more likely to be jobless than local people bro , you 've switched goal posts again . 
  i thought we were talking about germany . 
  does this mean you agree that immigrants are being successfully integrated in germany ? 
  each country deals with them however they see fit . 
  germany has done a good job at it . 
  sweden has n't . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  the troubles sweden is having with integrating them are mostly due to xenophobia . 
  people just do n't want to hire them , while also complaining that they have no jobs . 
  it will never work as long as they keep it up with that attitude . 
   do you think islamic terrorism is a problem in europe or is that just normal to you too ? 
  oh , this old argument again . 
  there are far more people dying from gun violence than from terrorist attacks . 
  also , you 've said it yourself that not all of them are from syria . 
  lots of them are coming from africa . 
  are they also terrorists ? 
  ** remember that terrorism has been a problem long before the immigrant waves started . 
  correlation does that imply causation . 
  ** you 're reaching for straws in a desperate attempt to justify your fear and anger towards immigrants and you 're failing . 
  you 've already switched goal posts twice after being confronted with facts that disproved your ideas . 
  your only `` proof '' was an article that says how immigrants in sweden are struggling to get jobs because of local xenophobia . 
   `` i want to work but i ca n't find anything , '' says mahmoud , now in his fifties . 
  `` i want to go home to basra [ in southern iraq ] . '' this guy surely came there to leech off the government . 
  / s  `` i was born here but i do n't feel swedish . 
  people just look at my skin and think i 'm from somalia , '' he says . 
  this guys is n't even an immigrant , but people still regard him negatively . 
  it 's clearly his fault for having a different color for his skin , amirite ? 
  / s  malmo 's record on crime has been in the spotlight ever since us president donald trump said that sweden was `` having problems like they never thought possible '' after taking in large numbers of refugees . 
  his comments -- which appeared to refer to an attack that never took place -- were largely ridiculed . 
   police say last year 's record number of murders in malmo -- ** a dozen -- were mostly gang related ** . 
  `` most of those [ gang ] guys are born here , ** they are not from syria ** , '' said hakan rengbrandt , a police officer . 
  in rosengard , the city 's most infamous neighbourhood , ** crime has been falling ** . 
  these are the facts . 
  from your own article . 
  did you even read it ? 
  why are you cherry picking ? 
  officials say that crime rates are falling , not rising . 
  you 've been mislead . 
   is this supposed to be anti-russia propaganda or something ? 
  it 's supposed to be humorous . 
  read the whole article . 
  yep . 
  but the ones that did n't get accepted are hilarious/worrisome . 
  read the whole article . 
   and we are talking about the economic migrants not legitimate refugees , which in total are much more than 700,000 . 
  yet , germany still has a budget surplus . 
  also , those `` economic migrants '' usually have jobs that contribute to that budget surplus . 
    they are a social burden as they are going to require society to take care of them and their children for years to come . 
  i asked for facts , bro . 
  not more vague tabloid propaganda . 
   so yeah , germany in one of their best economic years ever can handle the financial cost , but what about when things are not so good ? 
  one can argue that things are good because of those `` economic migrants '' that do most of the jobs that nobody else wants . 
  why do n't you also talk about that , huh ? 
  it 's either `` they have no jobs and are asking for handouts '' or `` they 're stealing all of our jobs '' . 
  how long before you 'll switch to the latter ? 
  this is good to hear . 
  :d i 've went on vacation to greece this summer , but i could n't pay with a card at most of the places i 've visited . 
  this needs to be encouraged more . 
  also , most vendors do n't even issue receipts . 
  paying via card guarantees a receipt . 
  trump and putin are also doing a great job . 
   it is possible that the financial burden is not being felt yet in germany . 
  you just admitted that those over 700 000 refugees in germany are not a financial burden to germany . 
   also i was not only talking about the financial burden but the social burden . 
  you just switched the goal posts , buddy . 
   you 're losing this debate . 
  they are not a `` social burden '' . 
  how exactly are they a `` social burden '' ? 
  be specific . 
  no tabloid propaganda . 
   south americans are n't flooding europe just because their countries have issues they 're flooding the us because europe is across the north atlantic ocean . 
  do you even think when making statements like this ? 
   they 're worsening ours by not assimilating into the culture that built said first world country , instead they insist on importing their own shitty culture which is famous for treating women like cattle and worshipping a pedophile , slaver , warlord . 
  i asked for specifics , not more tabloid propaganda . 
  you 're generalizing . 
  the same thing happened to germans after ww2 even though not all of them were nazis . 
  if they make crimes , you deport them . 
  saying that all of them are like that is nothing but xenophobia . 
  and , given germany 's history , you should really know better .
