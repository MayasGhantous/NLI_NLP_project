  so no oppressed russian minority that needs to be saved by mother russia . 
  ah but the oppressed russian majority that needs to be saved ... 
  irland 's stats are skewed by multinationals optimizing their taxes there, 
   there is absolutely no evidence [ history ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2011/09/28/debt-defaults-have-greek-history/#175a93d4f2f7 ) [ says ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/07/01/greece-has-been-in-default-for-50-of-its-time-as-an-independent-country/#73f4b3313bc5 ) that you have a habit with not paying debt . 
   pay ** everything ** back not possible anymore , some of the debt was already just `` deleted '', 
   they have a valid passport . 
  are n't most of them syrians who lost their passports ? 
  its the preferred trap of local hungarian leaders . 
  they managed to catch us ambassador with it and now that it will work with anyone . 
  president showed them is not that easy . 
  it looks like international energy agency sucks so much at predictions that maybe they should stop doing it and admit they have no clue . 
  territory is not that important anymore . 
  and there is n't that much to spoil anyway , territories were poor . 
  natural resources are less important nowadays than technology , knowhow ... 
  it wo n't solve structure of their economy , demography ( percentages from each age group is important here not total pop ) , declining of not properly maintained infrastructure . 
  and oil and gas will also be less important in 2 decades . 
  tl ; dr : imo long term they are fucked . 
   different times and circumstances . 
  yes . 
  they are finally in moldova 's position . 
  that 's why they also agreed to a common border checkpoint where moldavian authorities can check what enters in transnistria . 
  it was opened a few days ago . 
  after 25 years of helping russia undermining chisinau 's authority finally they get it , they know how it feels . 
   a country without a past ca n't have a future literally any country at some point in time . 
  so after 2.5 decades of shiting on romanians and supporting separatists transinistria we should go to war with russia just because russia did to ukraine exactly what it did to moldova with ukraine 's help ? 
  russia is a declining power, 
  iliescu fought very hard for that not to happen and he succeeded . 
  he managed to turn the king back ( out of romania ) same day he returned ( beginning of '90s ), 
  keep that post . 
  series is almost done and romania was n't picked yet . 
  but it is cost effective, 
   not for what ~ ~ your ~ ~ you 're thinking ffs you 're american . 
  let me help you . 
  click [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/zyhryis509a?t=15s ) and you 'll forget this song . 
  there is a difference between weird looks and bashing heads . 
  oh no you did n't . 
  no duda would beat tusk in poland 's 2017 presidential race ( if there would be one ) . 
  so many things can happen till 2020 ... 
  the one were they blamed romanians from day 1 without any proof ? 
  let me guess . 
  your theory is that soros pays only for english signs . 
  right ? 
  how is this relevant to brexit ? 
  there are also 2 cars that look like ladas to me, 
  hopefully they were smart enough to exclude the emergency number, 
   it 's who was let into the club . 
  whoever was let in was not only allowed by uk ( who could have vetoed ) but actually even promoted . 
  uk was a big advocate for that eu extension . 
  so no , you do n't get to complain now that you do n't like certain countries . 
  you had special exceptions . 
  it was n't enough . 
  then you threaten to leave ... negotiations ... you got more exceptions that your pm said they are ok . and still was n't enough , you voted out . 
  and now you 're asking for more exceptions so you do n't actually get out ? 
  how about gtfo then , enough is enough . 
  poland does this already, 
  did n't they had an attack on new year 's party in a club full with foreigners ? 
  a place that was considered safe enough . 
  do n't know where exactly it was but my point is that foreigners were targeted by crazy on turkey 's soil . 
  if you want gdp hit you need to go for the olympics . 
  greece and brazil could give you some advises . 
   hostile troops in our country would you mind passing that joint ? 
  looks like is too strong for only 1 person . 
   no fucking shit my ancestors emmigrated north .

   putin surely puts a lot of mony in the region [ sure ... ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-medvedev-crimea-visit-no-money-social-media-pensioner/27754644.html ), 
  he wanted to be sure that all exwives of your idol moliceanu have their own house . 
  i get that it might be too much . 
  but they are also helpful to know a few things about other countries in europe besides ( political ) news . 
  i hope these series will continue , but with a lower frequency and hopefully not overlapping like it happened now with food/presidents of europe . 
  not the `` q '' word please . 
  we do n't like it in this part of europe, 
  just `` mods of / r/europe '' things, 
   l 'm sorry with a bit of canadian it seems, 
  i get it . 
  you wo n't like these series for next 4 years . 
  first time i hear about this stereotype, 
  looks like `` police cars of europe '' is next series on this sub, 
  is that democracy that he 's chewing ? 
  and jerbs . 
  do n't forget about jerbs .

  they took care of army already ( not that it would be comparable with turkish army regarding secularism ) in chronological order : [ 1 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/polish-military-police-raid-nato-centre-warsaw ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/2016/03/06/polish-government-rocked-resignations-several-generals/81407288/ ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/17/mass-exodus-polish-armys-top-ranks-protest-political-interference/ ), 
  you guys are honorary europeans .

  we do n't buy just the patriot system but also security guarantees . 
  before our latin brothers make fun of us again you should know that we have '' ** lent ** '' also . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://prnt.sc/fuqxgs ) ? 
  40 % , 3rd lowest in eu iirc, 
  get in line buddy . 
  we 're busy with africans now, 
  you mean if china thinks that eu ca n't increase influence in africa ? 
  that would be pretty stupid on their part considering that eu is the queen of softpower . 
   less european influence in africa in that case is counter-intuitive to take from eu other means of stopping this immigration forcing it to increase said influence to achieve this goal . 
  bro do you even read ? 
  is right in this chain  bone , bone marrow , skin , nerves , blood vessels, 
  what exactly is that hard to understand ? 
  mechanically separated meat is not 100 % meat even tough it has `` meat '' word in its name, 
   `` kiev airport has ... chosen to protect high-fare airlines and deprive ukrainian consumers/visitors access to europe 's lowest air fares , '' ryanair said in a statement on monday . 
  apparently this is what they asked : * exemption from airport charges * free advertising * free ticket sales office * 60-day payment period * ** 35 percent ** of the income purchases made by their passengers at the airport .
