   once every 5 years huh ? 
  how come ? 
  you actually think that ( unless by some miracle they get deported ) these `` refugees '' and their descendants wo n't receive citizenship in 10-20 years from now ? 
  on the contrary . 
  russian carrier has a cloaking device . 
  and yet croatia joined nato in 2009, 
  to be fair most of the people saying that do n't know these details that you just wrote . 
  their logic is how you described it : anti-immigrants - .  fascist . 
  also while all these things that orban does/says are despicable , they do n't make him a fascist . 
  croatia joined eu while having a border dispute ? 
  ( or is it something so minor that is completely negligible ) . 
  i was under the impression that this is not possible . 
  you laugh but recently orban ( iirc ) said that horty is a great hero . 
  tisa , here i come, 
   let 's be realistic , most of the criminals are ~ ~ roma ~ ~ gypsies and if anything , ee countries tend to hate them not be overly lenient wit hthem . 
  ftfy . 
  i 'm sick of these people being called this way and create confusion with romania ( ns ) . 
  ** romanian ** terrorist, 
   you refuse to comment on how romania was not ready to join the eu . 
  i did n't refuse . 
  you did n't ask . 
  and no , romania was n't ready for eu in 2007 . 
  and while we came a long way since then , in some aspects we are still not ready even today . 
  and for sure we would be in a worse position ( economic for sure , but probably socially also ) if we did n't join back then . 
  but do n't you think you are asking a bit too much ? 
  asking from candidates standards that not even members would meet . 
  just think about italy and corruption and organised crime . 
   multi speed eu is a good thing for everybody its the officialization of cerrypicking . 
  some countries did this during negotiations , now further integration is cerrypicking all the way for everyone . 
  and yes , for now ( at least ) , is a good thing . 
  as long as op 's concerns do n't become true . 
   fuck me you 're ignorant what . 
  france did n't have french citizens committing terrorist attack recently . 
  who 's the ignorant one ? 
   can you talk about a topic without resorting to bullshit points trying to piss off the other person ? 
  i can . 
  but when you come here with your euro argument ignoring the complexity of a decision like this and giving me that formal erm thing , bring `` stability '' of the eurozone in question but missing the structural problems of euro , big problems in italian financial sector that can bring all this house of card down , then i will also come with half-assed arguments regarding schengen . 
   when is romanian ready to join ? 
  the real answer is when its economy will be as competitive as most of euromembers . 
  realistic , when we will get closer to average income of eurozone . 
  right now we are at 60 % of eu 's average . 
  romanian economy has some limited competitivity due to low wages but this is not really a model for development . 
  i hope that it will happen by 2030 . 
  only if you sing at a subway entrance . 
  yeah . 
  lets fund that russian army even more . 
  just as russia intervened in syria at syrian government 's request , any other country can get involved in eastern ukraine at ukrainian government 's request . 
   indeed , romania is much more stable than the eurozone . 
  romania ( for multiple reasons , one of them being no-euro ) managed to get out of the hole ( after financial crisis ) faster and better than many euro countries  how much money did romania borrow from the imf ? 
  do you think having euro would have changed anything regarding that loan ? 
   so romania not in schengen ... bad . 
  regarding faster movement of goods yes . 
  otherwise considering migrant crisis is actually good . 
  + we get to know when a french terrorist enters our country . 
   romania not in euro ... good ? 
  for now yes . 
  it has broad implications and if we 're not ready it will fuck us big time . 
   seems like countries like to cherry pick here . 
  there is so much to be said about this ... but i do n't want to waste my day writing pages about this . 
  and is not cherrypicking when we say that we will do it but we are not ready ** yet ** . 
  as you can see even in this thread , there are people who do n't understand what schengen is and start screaming `` gypsies '' . 
  i imagine average citizen is even less informed and is easier for politicians in west to say `` do n't worry , we will protect you , we wo n't allow the gypsy flood '' than to explain to them that it has nothing to do with that . 
  after next economic crisis i hope . 
  is due to arrive in a few years and it would be a bad idea to switch to euro right before . 
   romanian government 's actions big fail for google translate, 
   what 's the difference that poland and hungary have ? 
  their stance towards russia, 
  fighting islam maybe ? 
  i remember some politicians bragging that romania is 2nd contributor to nato 's intel . 
   which i 'm sure are on a high level . 
  [ totally ] ( http://giant.gfycat.com/unhappyelementarybluebottle.gif ), 
  no , yes , no ... maybe . 
  do n't know the answer to last one . 
  owned by usa now . 
  unlike bitdefender, 
  we need to add more balkan countries in eu . 
  there goes my childhood, 
  we need death penalty for corruptions so we can get rid of all these worms and the stupid left without corrupt people to vote . 
  v4 has in common attitude towards eu . 
  if you want to push it further you 're gon na a have a clash between poland 's and hungary 's external policies , particular towards russia . 
  in that regard , like you said , romania is a better ally for poland than hungary . 
  he should have just committed a small crime . 
  this is for 2016, 
  yeah . 
  european doctors and rocket scientists are afraid of competition, 
  when your generation gets in power do me 2 favors pls . 
  1 . fuck the pensioners . 
  they borrowed lots of money when they were in power impoverishing following generations (  100 % debt/gdp is insane ) while also stagnating the economy . 
  2 . default . 
  fuck the lenders ( part of them same pensioners through pension systems ) . 
  teach them to never lend money to such levels . 
  it will be painful for a while . 
  but you will recover faster than dragging this debt with you . 
  what about bulgarian business is european business ? 
  because i remember when eu said that south stream is not ok . 
  oh my sweet summer child ... 
  electoral fraud means that this scum is heart and soul for this party . 
  they consider that case political repression , and see this conviction as something to brag about . 
  he also controls ( through his `` tools '' ) lots of money from the budget and whoever is against him does n't get funds for his community ( from which they steal some ) , they can also be excluded from the party if they become too vocal ... 
  because this party is more like organized crime than a political party .
