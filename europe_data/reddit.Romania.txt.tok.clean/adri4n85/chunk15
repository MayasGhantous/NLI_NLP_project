  'cause he is convicted for electoral fraud . 
  in south also . 
  ^ ^ ^ during ^ ^ ^ night, 
  oh please . 
  like the thread with may 's failed wave was about more important things ... 
   / s here . 
  you dropped it, 
   wage increase if only . 
  they vote for whoever gives them a bucket . 
  even if is empty . 
  the most important part tested in this exercise is not displayed in the video . 
  deployment , logistics involved . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ya7r47zd4 ) video addresses some aspects of that . 
  i doubt that details of such operations are exposed to the public anyway . 
  i hope it will never happen . 
  it will drag down eu economy . 
  romania 's economy is very connected to german auto industry , we produce lots of components that are exported in germany for final assembly . 
  just like we did with hungarian politicians when they were accusing us of being nationalists . 
  who ? 
  take that . 
  double minority ( ethnic and religious ) president . 
  kinda destroyed their narrative . 
  detailed answer : imo this is the real reason behind all these moves . 
  current pm learned his lesson after 500k were in the streets in the middle of the winter ( begining of february , -10 c ) . 
  the justice minister at that time was also removed during all that situation . 
  however psd ( rulling party ) rewarded that scum with a good position in parliament . 
  lately constitutional court ( ccr , dominated by psd ) is acting shady , giving all kinds of favorable verdicts regarding anticoruption laws . 
  recently they said that parliament ( or government ) has ** the obligation ** to establish a threshold for abuse of office . 
  psd ruller ( dragnea ) is acused of this , damage being 108k ron iirc . 
  verdict will come soon . 
  in the famous oug13 the threshold was establised at 200k ron , this is the main reason that sparked the protests . 
  current justice minister ( former ccr member ) is unwilling to do so , he is kinda stalling , supposed to send some modifications to parliament regarding some law changes , among them about corruption also ( changes required by ccr , they kinda need to be done ) . 
  now he says that he will wait for ccr 's motivation for the threshold , dragnea is impatient and he wants a big enough threshold . 
  so he decided to sack the whole government to have a new justice minister ( pm is unwilling to change the current one or to sign any emergency ordinance regarding penal code anymore ) . 
  if dragnea succeeds most likely we will end up with a pm and a justice minister ( possibly the same one that did oug13 , just to show a big middle finger to whole romania ) that are willing to pass this emergency ordinance with a big threshold even though society asks the threshold to be 1 ron . 
  i 'm so sorry for all the people who do n't pay attention to romanian politics these days . 
  they will miss a great shitshow . 
  better than uk 's shitshow , just less important for europe . 
  ran out ? 
  not sure how relevant it is but to me it looks like we export things with more added value . 
  we have a decent auto industry . 
  [ ro ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rou/ ) [ bg ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/bgr/ ), 
  and i thought we have it bad with our [ necromancer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liviu_dragnea ), 
  we were close to have a muslim pm ( rejected because her husband has ties with assad ), 
  iirc they even add prostitution in gdp computation ( even if is illegal ), 
  gdp ** / capita **, 
  you 2, 
  i was n't clear enough . 
  i meant 0 refugees relocated through this refugees quota . 
  finally a straight to the point answer that i can accept and agree with . 
  thank you . 
  ( no irony . 
  i did n't have the information that you just wrote ) . 
  exactly . 
  if the comission wants to be respected and considered fair . 
  if they want to increase euroscepticism in ee then this is a very good course of action . 
   that was pulled out of thin air not the first time this shit is done . 
  remember how romania met all technical criteria to enter schengen and then suddenly out of thin air `` but muh corruption '' ? 
   did n't activly resist prodding by the commision you mean austria was not that vocal about this . 
  is that a valid reason for sanctions ? 
  `` shut your mouth or we will sanction you . '', 
   also that is like a ten year old level exucse , i should n't be punished becauese the other one has n't been ( yet ) . 
  should n't all be equal in front of the law ? 
  they made a common case to sanction `` rebels '' , but not all `` rebels '' . 
  we are not talking about different cases coming in random order in front of the `` court '' . 
  and after that they will wonder why they are not respected , why euroscepticism in ee is increasing . 
  because some countries are treated as second class countries . 
  you can be just as bad as second class countries , but if you are 1st class , you 'll be ok , do n't worry . 
  in that case brussels should care about implementation of refugee quotas . 
  sanctioning czechia ( who took 12 refugees ) and not austria ( who took 0 ) does n't make sense . 
  do you have something more recent than [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/28/austria-refuses-take-refugees-stalled-eu-scheme/ ) ? 
  [ they did ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/28/austria-refuses-take-refugees-stalled-eu-scheme/ ) . 
  they claim they they took enough outside of the scheme . 
  if that is acceptable then poland also took many ukrainian refugees . 
  edit : then, 
  yes, 
  it might be [ this ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2015/07/20/ ), 
   because they dont refuse to cooperate they took 0 refugees, 
  latest [ report ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20170613_factsheet_relocation_and_resettlement_en.pdf ) was released yesterday . 
  how come austria is n't sanctioned ?

  how come austria is n't sanctioned ? 
  le : i have my [ answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6h5dgl/eu_sanctions_czechs_poles_and_hungarians_over/divz2hc/ ), 
  [ as it should be ] ( https://image.slidesharecdn.com/southeastasia-whyyoushouldpayattentionnow-140623033836-phpapp02/95/southeast-asia-whyyoushouldpayattentionnow-2-638.jpg?cb=1403494782 ), 
  yep . 
  dacia is also manufactured in tanger, 
  looks like [ that time of the century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_and_interventions_in_hungary_ ( 1918 % e2 % 80 % 9320 \\ ) ) arrived again . 
  all warsaw pact countries except romania had revolutions without bloodshed afaik . 
  there are democratic ways you know . 
  ( peacefull ) protests , strikes , fiscal strike . 
  we are not talking about uk becoming a dictatorship here . 
  looks like you 're more russian than kaliningrad, 
  when they were forced . 
  and the possibility to return to your values after you get rid of the enemy . 
   $ 300 holly ... 
  families live here one month with this money ( excluding rent ), 
   russia will try to shake your politics i would use much stronger words than this when they plot to assassinate a pm . 
   i first thought you were just kidding . . and you 're right, 
  see guys ? 
  proof that all this was an albanian plot to take some serbian land .
