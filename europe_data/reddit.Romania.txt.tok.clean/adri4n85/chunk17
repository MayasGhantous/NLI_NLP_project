  they will stop coming when they know that this is the max that they will get . 
  dozens out of thousands . 
  its about risk vs reward . 
  true but if one member is attacked and the others send only encouraging words then nato is dead before next day . 
  no no germany 's hillary is the pm . 
  yesterday he met the president . 
  wonders of democracy, 
  seems like a win if we actually acknowledge valid criticism ( and there is some ) and take steps to fix things . 
  knives . 
  meh i wan na see some swords . 
  its for disabled people not for ugly people ^ ^ / s, 
  fuck the pork . 
  ^ \\ ( this ^ came ^ out ^ wrong ) they want to ban alcohol . 
  i did n't even think of that . 
  until i read your comment . 
  i hope you 're happy too . 
  no not when [ `` russia ` simulated a nuclear strike ' against sweden '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ) sweden , nonnuclear country that is also not in nato . 
  ^ ^ psst, 
  true however nato scenarios in various drills are about defense not about conquering or destroying a country . 
  how many times did nato threaten russia ? 
  russia constantly threatens countries with invasions , bombings , becoming targets for their nukes , ... etc. 
   its goverment buisness to keep people healthy do n't agree but lets assume that you 're right . 
  why is smoking still legal ? 
  dear hungarians , serious question . 
  wtf happened with your political class ? 
  how did you end up in this situation when orban looks like the good guy compared with the alternative jobbik . 
  where are the moderate , liberal , proeu guys to offer a balance ? 
  romania is not a country that you would take as model as a foreigner but in this case our political class ( corrupt af ) with all its fault somehow looks better than yours . 
  at least this is my impression , i 'm not saying this to offend hungary or hungarians , hope is not taken that way . 
  i rest my case, 
  whats the point of having them if you do n't place them in words ? 
  quantity not quality . 
  yeah . 
  from netherlands and germany, 
  haram, 
  such as ? 
  v4 countries do n't even have the same position regarding russia . 
  it started as `` let 's help each other with this eu thing ( int a good way , absorb funds , harmonize law ... ) '' , went to sleep and now was resurrected to piss off eu . 
  merkel : `` i am not a man , so i do n't have problems getting it up '' ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ economy, 
   i can never seem to be able to find up to date statistics with how many refugees we have taken since the start of the crisis [ here you go ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information_en ) 568 is the latest count for romania, 
  it 's a franchise . 
  just like mcdonald 's , you are forced to have specific furniture . 
  during ramadan should be even safer, 
  i hope this shithead will extend his vacation in bulgaria and enjoy the hospitality of a bulgarian prison . 
  and less than greece , portugal , hungary and czechia , all 4 with smaller population than romania . 
  more like [ person of interest ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/ ), 
  uk politicians ca n't wait to blame eu for the first terrorist attack that will happen after eu says to tone it down a notch with surveillance . 
  [ i need a neuralyzer ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/mye.gif ), 
   the eu can outbid most of the world for food if there 's a global shortage i do n't think this is possible . 
  if we are in such a crisis and famine is present on a global scale all countries will limit or ban food export to sustain their population . 
  that 's because romania being in europe , most people have higher expectations . 
  if romania as it is now would be located in africa most likely the question would be `` why is romania so rich ? 
  [ al jazeera 's response ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/editors-blog/2017/03/facebook-live-emojis-distortion-170323112744272.html ) from a previous terrorist attack . 
  sorry for being late i had to wait in long queue for some currency exchange in botswana, 
  what 's next ? 
  in continental europe definitely not . 
  how many irish attacks in france or sweden have you heard of . 
  if i would be in the island i would be suspicious . 
  relative to their recent succesfull attacks which is close to 0 . 
  unlike `` religion of peace '' attacks . 
  and you know that is only about that . 
  apart from their beef with london they are like every other european . 
  and here is the big difference . 
  the do n't hate regular londoner . 
  unlike muslim terrorist who does what he does because he hates who we are . 
  and now the more important question . 
  which came first , the peace or the grass ? 
  if you consider all crimes equal probably no ( per capita ) . 
  but if ponderate with the gravity of the crimes ... ( sure , not easy to quantify , but between a bomb and your wallet getting out of the bus one stop earlier than you ... ), 
  but that 's on facebook not on me , regular user . 
  and i thought germany is more progresive . 
  here in romania we do it [ in public ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/op38jqt ) and nobody bats an eye . 
  that 's because the turkish community in germany is using pornhub . 
  propers germans do n't have time for that , they are at work . 
  if he just liked the message then he agreed with the message but does n't mean that he tried to spread it . 
  for that he would have used the `` share '' button . 
  if you really want to go into the details foreigners also pay more than just this tax . 
  a considerable share from fuel price is excise tax that i would guess goes in infrastructure also . 
  pay as you go , most fair system ( imo ) . 
  germany is the only country that tried to be `` smart '' with this `` foreign only '' tax . 
  and if the amount gathered by what foreigners pay is bigger than cost of maintaining the infrastructure it means that only foreigners will pay and use while locals only use . 
  lots of countries have a vignette system where everyone who uses the roads pays , locals or foreigners . 
  is the tax deduction that creates this problem , that made eu also take a closer look at this law . 
  ee countries should pull the same dirty trick that germany used when they introduced a tax for using their roads and then allowed it 's own citizens to deduct from taxes , essentially making only foreigners pay the new tax . 
  we could allow companies to deduct this extra expense from taxes helping them to keep their competitiveness . 
  yeah . 
  but who did [ abba : you can dance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:video_games_developed_in_romania ) ? 
   we ~ ~ make ~ ~ buy the best games . 
  the best , i tell you . 
  because [ the alternative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezvmv4o-p0 ) is worse, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.entertrainer.tv/2014/06/aproape-toate-colajele-cu-patriarhul-si-trafaletulmiruitorul-telescopic/ ) first pic is an add at paint where they modified the slogan from `` paint easy , paint with spor '' ( spor = brand of paint that also means progress , speed ) to `` sanctify easy , sanctify with b.o.r '' ( biserica ortodoxa romana = romanian orthodox church ) 5th pic : psd is the biggest party in romania , in bed with the bor . 
  usl was an aliance that contained psd . 
  we want hospitals not cathedrals . 
  [ this is also funny ] ( http://kmkz.ro/sites/default/files/retrieve_images/patriarhul-la-deszapezire.jpg ) [ and this a little ] ( http://i0.1616.ro/media/521/2861/35026/16336302/2/media-143584518407032300.jpg?width=635 ) you can also try to google various combinations of `` preafericit , patriarh , daniel , trafalet , parodie '' maybe you can find other pictures, 
  done to death the first time this tool was used by the patriarch a few years back . 
  under ukraine, 
  was n't like that implicitly ? 
  did they have to actually put it in writing there ? 
  you thought you could keep bible belt from us ? 
  not when it comes to trade .
