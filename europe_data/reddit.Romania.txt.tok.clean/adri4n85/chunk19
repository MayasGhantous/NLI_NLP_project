  can it be seen as another reason to gtfo from uk ? 
   only ukrainian civilians are suffering ukrainian citizens in civil war on ukraine 's soild . 
  who else ? 
  i did n't hear about any fights beyond the border on russia 's soil . 
  at least that is russia 's narative . 
  unless you came here to contradict your master from kremlin and confirm to us that there are russian soldiers involved also ( during their vacation , sure , far from me the thought that they are there under orders ) . 
  is this what you wanted to say ? 
  because i actually agree with you . 
  ~ ~ not ~ ~ innocent russian ~ ~ soldiers ~ ~ volunteers suffer also . 
  why ? 
  you can `` know '' by reading statistics . 
  is not limited to personal experiences , unlike the first line that you quoted . 
  2005 called ? 
  it wants its website back, 
  good . 
  less money for russian army . 
  1 generation to stop being poor ( hopefully not more ) + 1 generation for the stereotype to disappear . 
  roughly 50 years . 
   33 billion lower than expected this seems a lot . 
  does n't this make netherlands bad at economic predictions ? 
  maybe worse than finland ? 
  small tip . 
  most recent islamic terrorist attacks were done by western europeans ( as in nationality , french and belgian iirc , born and raised there ) . 
  you can use that , 
  what 's up with poles ' fetish for bicycles ? 
  but also if i do n't give to you what you think i owe you i ca n't expect good will from you . 
  ** euro ** stat, 
  if you raise it too much it gets too close to minimum wage and you eliminate the incentive to work . 
   former two roma = gypsies, 
   young people living perpetually on apprenticeships [ i want to know their secret ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1tcdhrkqyg ), 
  but at least they do n't gang up to do the worst crimes possible , the kind of crimes that are not even financially motivated . 
  this form without substance is the least problematic type of religion imo . 
  last stand of church before society break free . 
   orthodox church yeah because orthodox church set up a system to protect pedophiles , not the vatican . 
  all you said is true and i agree . 
  i just said that they could have recovered quicker if they could have inflated their currency and not have the high unemployment rate for so long . 
  yes they have systemic problems that have nothing to do with euro that put them in this mess in the first place . 
  euro made recovery for southern countries much slower after 2008 crisis because they could n't just inflate their currency . 
  wait . 
  did he also accused israel of doing the same thing since 1800s ? 
  what a waste . 
  destroying equivalent of 7 camels instead of just selling your property . 
   exactly . 
  case in point : ukraine . 
  ukraine is poor but at least has war in some of its territory . 
  some ( most ? ), 
  of mena imigrants come from countries without active military conflict . 
   so poland can take in a percentage of those 9 % no it ca n't . 
  poland is not good enough for these refugees . 
  they will leave and go to germany and sweden . 
  sorry about that . 
  i also apologize for that attack . 
  as for the portugal , i still do n't understand how they won . 
  maybe is not my cup of tea . 
  oh really i missed your point ? 
  what is your point then ? 
  because you sure missed mine even after i explained it to you twice . 
  i was saying that not doing x did n't make them loose and your reply was that nothing suggests that they won because of that . 
  ffs you really are dense . 
  i 'm just saying that this win proves that singing in another language than english is not a disadvantage , you do n't need to sing in english to have a chance . 
  i did n't say that he won because of that . 
  on the other hand having a medical condition does n't hurt . 
  almost all songs were in english to boost their chances . 
  in the end 1 of the only 4 ( i think ) non english won proving that you can sing in hungarian , bulgarian , polish ... and still have a chance . 
  on the plus side maybe more countries will take the hint and not sing in english next time . 
  if after this netherlands still say no to us being in schengen ... 
  yodel, 
  you mean [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3wkzyin1yk ) ? 
  at least we do n't have justin bieber, 
  let 's take last elections france vs romania france elections turnout eu ( 2014 ) - parliament ( 2012 ) - presidential ( 2012 ) : 42 % -55 % -80 % romania elections turnout eu ( 2014 ) - parliament ( 2012 ) - presidential ( 2014 ) : 32 % -41 % -64 % looks like romania in general has lower turnout regardless of election type , however ratio between elections ( eu vs parlament , eu vs presidential ) is very similar betweeen france and romania ( 76 % / 78 % who cared about parlament and 52 % / 50 % who cared about the president cared about eu elections also ) . 
  tl ; dr : romanians care about eu elections relative to national elections as much as french . 
  source : [ france ] ( http://www.oldsite.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?id=53#pres ) [ romania ] ( http://www.oldsite.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?id=189#pres ), 
  1 . is n't that place is filled now by swiss franc ? 
  germany is a huge exporter atm , is n't a weak euro better for their economy ? 
  i hope whatever funds are transferred to southern countries make up for the loss in competitiveness . 
  otherwise spain , italy and greece will be truly fucked . 
   euro to grow against the dollar why would he want that ? 
   good song  win that 's not how eurovision works, 
  only ? 
  29 million ( more than ro+bg total population ) are on their way to uk . 
  ( source : british press 2014 ) . 
  i 'm sure we can gather at least 5 billion for switzerland . 
  because most of electricity production in france is nuclear i guess . 
  clean enough ( compared to coal for example ) . 
  and greedy to the core of the core, 
  [ for lazy people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217h8jppi ), 
  in [ russia ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-signs-law-allowing-russian-court-to-overthrow-international-human-rights-rulings-a6773581.html ), 
   turkish citizens who will vote in turkish territory ( embassies and consulates ) i will seriously be very impressed if turkey 's government manages to setup logistics so that a few millions of turks can vote in the embassy and a few consulates in 1-2 days . 
  usually they vote on stadiums in germany from what i heard . 
  so yeah , without germany 's support only a few thousands will be able to vote on turkish territory . 
  put webcams on each tank and stream it live . 
   democracy was never present in russia , and never could work . 
  i would n't say never . 
  first oil and gas needs to become worthless . 
  then you will have a chance . 
  maybe in 2 generations, 
  [ jus sanguinis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) vs [ jus soli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ), 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.insse.ro/cms/sites/default/files/com_presa/com_pdf/poprez_ian2016r.pdf ) ( [ raw data ] ( http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/statistici/comunicate/com_anuale/populatie/poprez_ian2016r.xls ) ) there were 5.61 m 20-40 years in romania ( out of 19.76 m ) at the begining of 2016 . 
  as you can see out of all emigration ( - imigration ) in 2015 20-40 is somewere around 61 % while the same category is ~ 28 % of romania 's residents . 
  you also have [ here ] ( http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/publicatii/pliante%20statistice/migratia_internationala_a_romaniei_n.pdf ) a statistic about romanian emigration between 2002 and 2012 .
