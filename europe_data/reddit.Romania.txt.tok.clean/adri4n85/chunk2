  that 's your example ? 
  you 're making it sound like is an isolated incident . 
  it 's a whole stream of similar attitude at the highest level of russian politics , even before romania joined nato . 
   blame georgian no , i blame russia because russia 's power was used to do that . 
  also germany was the one split in 2 after ww2 not austria , event though hitler was austrian . 
   treasure ? 
  this [ treasure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure )  no one threatened you . 
  [ one example ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/russian-diplomat-twitter-threatens-to-fly-a-bomber-into-romania/362032/ ) . 
  i understand that we are a target in a nato vs russia war . 
  that is fair . 
  i 'm talking about useless threats here , just because russia has a hard time understanding a no . 
  and lets be honest , we would be a target of russia even without nato . 
  we always were because we stand in the way to russia 's access to mediteranean sea . 
  no i hate russia because of its actions against my country . 
  also my childhood was affected indirectly in a negative way because of russia 's actions many decades before ( installing comunism in romania ) . 
  i also hate russia because of things that it could and should be fixed ( because is the right thing to do ) but they refuse to do so ( returning our treasure for example ) . 
  i also hate russia for more recent actions ( attacking their neighbours ) and threating to bomb romania because we are not their lapdogs . 
  why the / s ? 
  not that much paper work . 
  you just have to show an id . 
  ask greece how it was before 2007 . 
  at least they will have freedom of movement ( and by that i mean no border checks ) between them . 
  so it 's something :d, 
  if eu countries ignore him he could also target russia . 
  maybe he will get a response from there . 
  in the other map ( ottoman empire ) the 3 romanian provinces were only vassals and not under direct administration ? 
  slavs going around us here . 
  why nobody wants us ? 
  not in the next 4 years . 
  we voted for idiots and corrupts 3 months ago . 
  it matters for places where these asylum seekers are . 
  and they are everywhere , in general population , since we do n't have closed camps for them . 
  so yeah , for now it matters . 
  when asylum seekers will be segregated from the rest of society ( until their request receives a verdict ) and only when they are accepted allowed freedom of movement then it wo n't matter ( actually it will matter still , but far less ) . 
  wait . 
  this is real ? 
  i saw this thing a few days ago but i thought is satire . 
  reality truly beats fiction sometimes . 
  if you compare this to designing and implementing a proper ( and well functioning ) educational or healthcare system it is `` low effort '' . 
  we are not able to even extend the subway system done in communism or even maintain the railway system . 
  so yeah , constructing a building ( a big one ) is apparently one of a few things that we are still able to do . 
  for now . 
  electoral joke in romania :  why do we have elections ? 
   so that udmr ( hungarian party , always ~ 5 % of votes ) know who will govern with them . 
  it was very true untill few years ago . 
  as a romanian also . 
  we had < 40 % 3 months ago . 
   ( in addition to the war reparations demanded by the armistice convention of 1944 . 
  so no , that was on top of that price . 
  i did n't say slave . 
  and not me personally since i 'm too young for that . 
  you can start with [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom ) to see how russia stole from romania . 
  you can also check [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure ) you can also inform yourself about valev plan and what that would have meant for romania . 
  about forced deportations from basarabia . 
  so yeah , you russia is untrustworthy oppressive backward country . 
  deal with it . 
  edit : typo, 
  and that gives russia to right to finance foreign parties ? 
  by the same logic can we send lots of protection ( cause you know , lots of people drink their tea with poison in them for some reason , or they barge in the trajectory of a bullet ) and money to opposition in russia ? 
  sure they could have killed a lot more than they did . 
  problem is that production of dead people is too low ( only fertilizers ) , not much to steal . 
  so wanting to trade less is a reason for war now ? 
  same magical solution that fixes all problems : build a wall . 
   once * twice, 
   they want to abolish prime minister position and give all the executive powers to the president the wording of the referendum question was : `` the office of the president of the reich is unified with the office of the chancellor . 
  consequently all former powers of the president of the reich are demised to the f\u00fchrer and chancellor of the reich adolf hitler . 
  he himself nominates his substitute . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_referendum,_1934 ) so basically hitler . 
  i guess he anticipated this comparison and that 's why he is attacking others as nazis . 
  what makes you think they know the answer ? 
   ( abonament , do n't know how to translate that ) . 
  subscription . 
  if is like in romania , is forced subscription , basically a tax . 
  nice try putin, 
   and romania is the most corrupted country in the eu and again another lie . 
  check the link in my post . 
  in particular italy , greece and bulgaria . 
   romania is the most corrupt country in europe by far til that moldova , ukraine , russia , few countries in western balcans or caucasus have less corruption than romania . 
  or maybe [ not ] ( http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) . 
   do n't try to give lessons to france this was posted by a french not by a romanian . 
  but i guess you do n't know flags that well . 
  maybe you do n't know much about europe actually . 
  so fuck off now . 
  see you in 5 years when romania will be ahead of spain in corruption index . 
  lets wee what you 'll invent then . 
  edit : typos, 
  the rural fauna does n't live outside monerary economy . 
  not completely . 
  a good chunk of them receive money they do n't deserve making it even harder for `` modern '' romanian . 
  i remember montenegrins standing in queues in the middle of the night to donate blood for few dozens romanians injured in a [ bus crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_podgorica_bus_crash ) . 
  ** thank you for your help . 
  also if that documentary with leonardo di caprio is right , europe will actually become colder not warmer, 
  poor but improving . 
  anyway this was a joke in reference to [ thank god for mississippi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thank_god_for_mississippi ), 
  how do you know ? 
  crime statistics ? 
  in this case sweden must be the poorest country in eu judging by rape statistics . 
  different territories , different laws , different rule of law , different culture ( about reporting rape ) . 
  murder can be financially motivated so is irrelevant to my argument . 
  stop justifying nonmaterialistic violent crime ( rape for example ) with poverty,
