  thanks bulgaria, 
   greece is still the wealthiest country in the balkans and that 's why poorer ee people are reluctant when they hear about debt relief for grece .

  even hungarians confuse bucharest with budapest . 
  thank you for this accurate reply,

  thank god for ~ ~ mississippi ~ ~ bulgaria, 
  catalin drula is also a cool guy . 
  he did a few good things for transport infrastructure . 
  probably they did it faster than it took us and bulgarians to build a bridge over danube a few years ago . 
  we tried in ww2 . 
  did n't work . 
  uk export to rest of eu  10 % of gdp rest of eu export to uk ~ 2.5 % of rest of eu gdp, 
  president can dissolve the parliament only after they fail to put a government in place twice after 60 days . 
  he nominates the prime-minister but has no saying about ministers and he ca n't dismiss the government . 
  parliament can suspend the president at any time and a referendum is held . 
  how do you differentiate . 
  ask them to eat pork ?

  why ? 
  they care about how much till their aggressor collapses . 
  [ eastern europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2gdp0tlqsq ), 
   then again this would trigger a lot of ` conversions ' if put into general practise . 
  and it will happen once information how she was killed in iran hit the news and sweden is like `` we were wrong , lets make a law and accept anyone in similar situation '', 
  shoved on their throats , obviously bounce back after regime fell . 
   if your teenage daughter [ ... ] liked the stolen gold chains then you are already a failure as a parent and lost the moral right to complain . 
   most conservative nationalist country in western europe and yet you still got infected, 
   it was the price that 's what war reparations are for . 
  i 'm talking on top of that . 
   also , i think that soviet mismanagement of the economies did much more to screw up eastern europe than us aid did to improve western europe . 
  definitely . 
  i would say the difference would be 2 orders of magnitude . 
  marshal plan did n't have the huge impact that some people believe . 
  but it was received when needed the most . 
  not that bad when you compare it to  in theory , sovroms were joint romanian-soviet ventures aimed at generating revenue for reconstruction , and were created on a half-share basis in respect to the two states ; however , they were mainly designed as a means to ensure resources for the soviet side , and generally contributed to draining romania 's resources ( in addition to the war reparations demanded by the armistice convention of 1944 and the paris peace treaties , which had been set at 300 million united states dollars -- see romania during world war ii ) . 
  the soviet contribution in creating the sovroms lay mostly in reselling leftover german equipment to romania , which was systematically overvalued ) ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom ) ), 
  [ not again ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w4zvft2c44 ), 
  meanwhile they were busy stealing everything they can ( on top of war reparations ) . 
  at least that 's what they did in romania . 
   i must say you should . 
  even if you do n't believe it . 
  ownership of press maybe, 
  iron curtain again . 
  ( sorry little brazil and bigger macedonia ), 
  galactic center also moves along with the rest of the galaxy . 
  lol . 
  not being in schengen does n't change anything regarding their freedom of movement . 
  they just show their id before leaving the country . 
  considering that we did try to warn you about some of them and you guys came at us with `` you guys do n't want to integrate them , you discriminate them ... '' this is just poetic justice . 
  you have a chance to do it and show us how . 
  and no , the french way , putting them on airplanes and paying them to come to vacation in romania does n't mean integrating them . 
  as for the others , ethnic romanians , pickpocketing does n't sound so bad compared to british pedophiles that came to take advantage of street kids in romania . 
  move to ee . 
  we wo n't allow this kind of crap here . 
  looks like there 's a bot for anything . 
  i need a blowjob . 
  we called it `` the endurance test '' .

  the quote or my opinion ? 
   recently , after bosses appealed to the supreme court , it was ruled that a company 's employers not paying the wages of their workers for a long time does not contribute to worsening working conditions -- confirming once more that justice has a class character . 
  it takes sides with the powerful , the oppressors and the exploiters . 
  at this point , when justice is not justice anymore , i 'm perfectly ok with people taking matter in their own hand and literally lynching some people . 
  clearly state fails to do is job and this can not continue like this . 
  are you disrespecting his culture ? 
  you racist . 
  but is not only that girls were raped ( in this hypothetical scenario ) . 
  they were raped by `` them '' . 
  who are `` they '' ( whites ) to rape `` our '' girls . 
  never underestimate the power of `` us vs them '' rhetoric . 
  i 'm ok with reopening auschwitz to accommodate these people . 
  dying together . 
  so romantic . 
  too late for what ? 
  are they behind the smuggle schedule ? 
  and close that `` wage gap '' ? 
  you want to destroy feminism ? 
  seems like we have a very innovative idea here . 
  where do you live ? 
  he is british citizen . 
  and now you know how romanians feel with the whole gypsy situation .

  i 'm sure romania and poland will jump right in . 
  much easier to find english-romanian translator,
