  what you suggest should be an exception not a rule . 
  and this ban on selfdefence weapons makes things a lot worse because potential attacker knows that it has higher chance of success since probability of that person to have some skills or some selfedefence weapon is low . 
  you should think before and use police resources as taxi . 
  i 'm sure it will be fun when this shit will be abused . 
  nah they 're cool . 
  they even let him fly in their airspace . 
  which means either high risks ( going really hard after smuglers ) or when europe becomes a shithole that none want to come here anymore . 
  or when european states start deporting illegals en masse , but i 'm asking for too much here . 
  in that case she should be able to sue the state also for failing to protect her and she had to do all of that herself . 
  what ? 
  state can protect you 24/7 ? 
  then maybe should leave some room for selfdefence , real seldefence not just empty hands bullshit that does n't really work for most girls since it depends a lot of body strength . 
  basically danish state forces physically weaker citizens to be victims if someone wants to hurt them and police is not around . 
  we sent them after that russian clown, 
  really ? 
  source ? 
  i call bs . 
  all i could find is 5.6 for romania vs 2.2 for sweden ( gdp not gdp/capita ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8057546/2-08062017-ap-en.pdf/8321df8a-ba1b-433e-9cdc-bfd81e3f4a45 ), 
  spain is one of those lipsticked piig ** s **, 
  and / capita ? 
  suck it bulgaria ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  what i see is the airport worker making a sudden gesture that is instinctively interpreted by the father holding his child as a threat and acting instinctively to eliminate that threat from the proximity of his child . 
  after that the employer decides to go with a full punch because it is known that parents holding children are in the best position to want to start a fight and are a danger if they are not physically handled immediately right ? 
  nevermind that depending on father 's reaction in that instant that worker he could have hit the child the way he threw that punch . 
  what did you see while watching the clip ? 
   i wonder if it also counts those who are no longer looking for work it should n't . 
  afaik it supposed to count people who do n't work but look for work and are able to start work in 2 weeks if a suitable work is offered . 
  it helps by stabilizing state finances and in time create a better climate for running businesses witch will lead to creating wealth . 
  yes , is a long term plan . 
  situation like the one greece is in can not be solved in few years . 
   but that would have crashed the big french and german banks you 're making it sound as if these banks would have defaulted it would have stopped there . 
  most of the money in these banks are not money of people owning the banks . 
  regular citizens would have been hit as well . 
  the insurance fund ( or however is called ) can only cope with a limited failure , it can not face a systemic failure of multiple banks failing . 
  all the loses at stock exchange ( where these banks are listed ) , loss of confidence in german and french banking system ... could have catastrophic consequences propagated to regular citizen , pensions , loss of jobs , ... etc. 
  we live in times of huge interconectivity , a failure somewhere can trigger a storm in another place . 
  is not that easy . 
  sure . 
  but there must be a limit a few litters for personal use when you transit the border . 
  you ca n't cross the border with a truck full of vodka and say is for personal use . 
  or an airplane . 
  they still have reserves of sanitary alcohol . 
  on a more serious note i wonder if by doing this putin is n't circumventing his own sanctions . 
  or those are only for food ? 
  so russians ran out of vodka . 
  the thing is that some `` romanians '' ( and not only ) have shit to do for more than 3 months per year . 
  and no , they do n't have papers for that . 
  wtf ? 
  dude , how hard is it to understand what i said ? 
  do you have comprehension problems ? 
  in the future , when uk will not be in eu anymore ... 
  if you need a visa for uk you ca n't go with airplane in london and just pass the border check ( unless you have the visa ofc ) . 
  but you can go to ireland and from there just drive in the uk since there 's no border check . 
  and same for goods also , people will just traffic goods once taxes for imports are added . 
  joke 's on him . 
  if he was an islamist he would be free to kill now . 
  they do n't need it atm . 
  airplane straight to london ( luton actually ) is better for now . 
  [ right in the article ] ( https://liveuamap.com/pics/2017/07/28/21503379_0.jpg ), 
   no one wants ro read the newsheader `` germany is building camps for foreign and unwanted people - again . '', 
  and instead we read `` hamburg attacker known islamist ... ''  costs you 're giving them money anyway . 
  if you do n't is either illegal work ( best case ) or crime ( financialy motivated ) . 
  you could actually have lower cost/capita in closed camp . 
  besides what 's the big deal ? 
  closed immigration centers ( especially for people denied permission ) is not some novelty . 
  afaik romania has some closed immigration centers , basically temporary location for people who want to enter the country but do n't have that right . 
  sure , capacity is much smaller than this wave , but is the same principle and no echr fined romania for having such facilities . 
   this a government or a county task who has the power to decide in immigration matters ? 
  who is responsible for deportations ? 
   do whatever you want ( - crime ) ffs i wrote it . 
  its still german soil ( in this example ) , german law applies . 
   type of secured detention center . 
  like a closed camp for people that should be deported since they do n't have the right to be in the country and mix with citizens anymore . 
  prison would be to much . 
  remember , until this attack this guy was not guilty of any crime ( except immigration crime , but that is not enough to consider him a danger ) . 
  seriously do i need to explain the difference ? 
  in prison you 're monitored , have a schedule , locked in a cell most of the time ... in closed camp you 're allowed to do whatever you want ( - crime ) . 
  the only restriction is to stay in the camp , you can not go into `` general population '', 
   a head start on the super markets in ee . 
  and because it was n't enough they pulled some [ shitty moves ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/lidl-1bn-public-development-funding-supermarket-world-bank-eastern-europe ) also, 
  + known to the german authorities as an islamist + obliged to leave the country + he had not been able to be deported because he had no papers [ credit to / u/fuckupharzer for translation ] so lets allow him to roam free the entire schengen area . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  seriously why the fuck are not these kind of people kept in closed camps ? 
  and your source that does n't have this problem would be ... ? 
  that 's plain abuse of power . 
  but still ... 12 years ago . 
  things changed for the better in the meantime . 
   they do n't want a border will see about that once gypsies figure * this one simple trick * to enter uk . 
  [ my favorite ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-31/ukraine-russia-twitter-spat/8574868 ) [ 2nd favorite ] ( https://twitter.com/ukraine/status/879706437169147906 ), 
  priceless, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=lena+highway&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjuga7n46zvahxdb5okhqf_dukq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ) is what russians call a highway . 
   found a bug that 's an understatement . 
  its a motherfucking huge security flaw that should be punished by guillotine . 
  i do n't know what 's worse , such implementation that should get responsible people fired and ejected from industry or the stupid reaction after they got exposed . 
  usually insults . 
  ( with added criticism but they are happy when they can find insults in that criticism to take revenge for exposing their wrongdoings and hypocrisy ) . 
  howerver one guy got fined because he refered to them ( through facebook ) as [ jerks ] ( http://www.tion.ro/timisoreanul-chemat-la-politia-locala-pentru-o-postare-pe-facebook-a-fost-amendat-merge-in-instanta/1817724 ) in a post where he put pictures with their cars parked on sidewalk . 
  that 's obviously an overreaction from police . 
  lucky you ours started to fine people who say bad things about police on facebook .
