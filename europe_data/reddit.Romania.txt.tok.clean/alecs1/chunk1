but would n't this require the cooperation of hundreds of people ? 
  members of electoral institution , the police who guarded the votes , the people who counted unused paper on camera and pretended there 's nothing fishy . 
  [ mannheim ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/63h26a/mannheim_in_germany_got_new_bike_lanes_yay/ ), 
  what 's the spanish biggest one , taringa ? 
  john kerr \u201e has argued publicly -- and controversially -- that article 50 is not irrevocable . 
  in other words , during the two-year negotiating period set out in the text , britain could decide not to leave after all and simply remain an eu member . 
  however , he says he can not imagine how politics in britain would allow such a u-turn . '' https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61zk9x/i_didnt_have_uk_in_mind_article_50_author_lord/ the vote was very close , and this apparent consensus among british politicians that it should go ahead full-speed seems an artefact of the way uk elections and parties work ; i 'd expect that immediately after brexit there will be a movement for rejoining eu ( provided nothing horrific happens to eu in this period ) . 
  were i an uk citizen , i 'd start such a political movement right away , both because i believe in the idea and because of the opportunity to get a lot of votes  ) edit : typos, 
  til [ infowars is not a the onion type of website ] ( https://www.salon.com/2013/05/02/alex_jones_conspiracy_inc/ ) of course i heard about it before ( i wasted some time on / r/politics in 2016 ) but i had no idea it has so many followers and is so serious . 
  those headlines are mental . 
  did eu institutions have such conversations with v. kara-murza or the russian opposition does n't have any expectations from eu ? 
  on an almost serious note , i think this late in the party there 's only one thing to do : send 100 trucks with humanitarian aid , composed of mainly bullet proof vests and helmets , radiation detectors and a couple of armoured cars and machine guns . 
  it will ensure that in 20-30 years , when there will be a power struggle among the clique , a couple of people from the current opposition will still be alive . 
   mazda 323c is [ this beauty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mazda_familia#familia_neo.2f323c ) your type of car ? 
  most likely this model still has a cable to control airflow , and the sensors only measure air flow . 
  summary : not a `` eu is doomed article '' , but rather a funny list of things that hinder eu , starting with a greek god and going on with a couple of high profile politicians , and even some things that could easily be done better . 
  thank a lot , at least i have a starting point . 
  unfortunately ( or maybe fortunately ) i do n't buy any of the things listed there, 
  really , can we get a list of brands so that we have some meaningful discussion ? 
  still waiting for some results and real data , even from some non-professional that travels a lot . 
  last time i saw news like this on reddit it did n't contain details either . 
  i 'm romanian and do n't think i 'm cheated that much ( if at all ) . 
  so maybe i did n't go to the right shops , but i 'm pretty sure that i did n't get worse stuff for the same price . 
  ( the only thing i ever noticed in this direction is that uk milk was a lot better than romanian one for the same price , but this is a local thing ), 
  excellent food and motorcycle helmets . 
  my main concern too . 
  so i 'm thinking of advantages like a better eurozone , easier to set-up military and diplomacy , cooperation in large projects and a large pool of hopefully competent people to work in the federal government . 
  but the idea of being blocked in inside something like usa sounds is scary ( wo n't say russia , getting to that level of mafia state takes big effort ) . 
  ministers being completely clueless about technology and generally incompetent morons , sounds a lot like my country . 
  but really , if the message was sent seconds before the attack , the argument is really poor and should make her look rather stupid . 
  what kind of monumental logistics would you need to react in minutes to every possible threat while avoiding false alarms ? 
  while the pictures are not fake , they 're only a selection , of course not the whole country was like this . 
  things are better now , but apart from the falling apart bus and buildings and the gypsy selling seeds , you could find some similar scenes today too  ) ), 
  loved the article , but was n't it a bit staged ? 
  the questions seem too spot on ; is the journalist so well trained in the subject ? 
  for example the following questions flow so well it suggests they were thinking of hitting the same subject :  what could explain in professional terms that hungarian authorities knew about the connections between the mna and the gru and that gy\u0151rk\u00f6s 's organisation also possessed weapons , yet they did not intervene for years ? 
   was the reason the hungarian agencies ' fear of the gru or hungarian politics ' fear of vladimir putin ? 
   does such an information belong to let 's say the five largest national security threats to hungary in a given year ? 
  so my theory is that index.hu ( or maybe ferenc katrein ) thought : `` these idiots we have as politicians are becoming too moronic in their plays with russia ; let 's shame them a bit through an interview , maybe they fuck around less dangerously . '', 
  anyway , i like the guy . 
  here in romania i think the intelligence does a good job , but the high level officials are either inarticulate morons , or guys that speak in so many metaphors and double entendre it gets tiring . 
   the german government even tried to prosecute it 's own citizen for making fun of erdogan . 
  are you talking about [ b\u00f6hmermann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%b6hmermann_affair ) ? 
  i do n't read that as `` trying to prosecute '' . 
  at all !, 
  the precedent has been set ( usa had 2 years of campaigning and polling ) , so we have no chance to escape this :d, 
  without a doubt first past the post is retarded . 
  i 'm not sure about threshold , but if that exists it should be low too . 
  i think it is extreme when compared to most others which require a threshold . 
  til `` the dutch electoral system is an extreme version of proportional representation , in which multi-party coalitions are the order of the day . 
  any party that wins more than 0.67 per cent of the vote will get a seat in the 150-strong parliament . '' edit : quotes . 
  little 300 words article that says nothing more than the title : they 're not mental so they 'll prepare for all situations . 
  give me a break with the latest internet buzzword called pc . 
  i 'm tired of anti-pc uncalled-for heroes . 
  this is not \u201e political correctness '' , this is \u201e correctness '' . 
  gypsies from romania being uneducated and living in extreme poverty has been a long unsolved problem . 
  just like romanian ethnics living in 4 square meter houses made of clay a couple km away from my birth place . 
  and how am i fuelling any le pen crap ? 
  it was n't me who 's acting like a hipster with superiority complex \u201e ooohh , i 'm a first-class ethnic , i 'm romanian while those bad guys are gypsies '' . 
  it 's a fucking problem that the society needs to admit and solve , not defer because they 're gypsies or whatever . 
  please ignore this guy . 
  if they have romanian citizenship they 're romanians . 
  next thing he 's going to say 80 % percent of the country is not romanians : they 're vasluieni when one rapes , they 're teleorm\u0103neni when one defrauds elections , craioveni when one stabs , mitici when they cheat , olteni when they 're uneducated , moldoveni when they talk with a funny accent and unguri if they 're from covasna . 
  so you 're suggesting that the last two cities willing and able to host the olympics will be used up in 2028 ? 
  as such these events will have to be rethought into something decent that does n't cost 10 billion in single use infrastructure . 
  sounds good , 
  what was the old policy ? 
  i read the announcement and do n't understand what was in place previously . 
  oh come on / r/europe , cat thread is already two hours old and has only 12 points . 
  i know turkey does n't get much sympathy anymore because of jackass president and ruling party , but this is about ** cats on the internet ** !, 
  sure , i know that and i understood your original message . 
  but i asked the base question : \u201e why is it a left-right thing ? '' . 
  ( the answer is n't \u201e it is traditionally a left wing topic '' because that would go in circles ), 
  this clumping of issues on a left-right scale always triggers me . 
  i do n't get why issues such as nuclear power has to be placed on the left-right thingy , when it should be primarily a costs and engineering problem . 
  aaaaahhh , i 'm having such a hard time deciding how to cast my votes to keep these two threads together in the `` hot '' sorting . 
  the introductory sentence seems taken directly from romanian : \u201e fute-v-ar dumnezeu pe to\u021bi '' :d, 
  thank you for the link , i posted them . 
  did you improve the coherence of your public relations in the last 2 months ? 
  what changes have you made and to what effect ? 
  i 'm thinking specifically of the mr. moroianu 's facebook episode ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/5iaobr/scandal_%c3%aen_usr_so%c8%9bul_lui_clotilde_armand_%c3%ael_acuz%c4%83/ ) , which left a very bad taste ( the wording is polite , since i trust usr and even consider joining ) . 
  do you know details about the investigation over the 2016 campaign funds ? 
  not a question : i hope usr will be in good shape in 2019 and prepare relevant subjects for european parliament elections in 2019 , especially since you have mr. ghinea with you . 
  yo man , thank you very much . 
  for 1400 or whatever upvotes you bash / r/europe as a whole . 
  and while i did n't even click the original picture or thread ( i do n't generally give a s *** about pictures without context ) , i did have to waste 15 minutes navigating these 2 threads to understand why you had such a strong reaction . 
  i guess you 're quite good at clickbaiting titles . 
  upvoted the thread as it 's a good lesson for people to stop wasting their time on the next occasion . 
  thank you . 
  i was preoccupied i wo n't be able to be online at the time and forgot how this works .

  is this alternative history or do you know stuff we do n't ? 
  my understanding of the situation is nothing similar to your allegations . 
  how are those relations ? 
  when is one in full control of his life ? 
  it 's very sad if parents get to decide for children old enough to go to a master 's .
