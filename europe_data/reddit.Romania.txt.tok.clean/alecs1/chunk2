  it is more expensive than home , but less so than i expected . 
  thinking about all the cities i know , daily spendings are decent if you 're willing too search a bit , it is housing that is outrageous almost everywhere . 
  compared to bucharest : * supermarkets - 2-4 time more expensive and limited choice , over 4x with the \u201e fancy '' imported food ( decent prosciutto or moulded cheese ) and fruits * public transportation - a bit more expensive , incomparably better * restaurants - this was puzzling : it was generally some 2-3 x the price in romania , but near the sentosa train those seafood mini restaurants had unbelievably good food for 9-15 sgd , i 'd say cheaper than here for the quality * did n't touch alcohol in singapore because of the price : back here a beer is ~ 0.3 - 1.2 sgd in supermarkets , 1-3 sgd in restaurants and bars, 
  if there 's any crap record to outdo , we 'll take the task . 
  i think i get what you did here . 
  the concept i was looking for is ad hominem , and the parent was using it in a less direct way . 
  have an upvote , cunning sir . 
  funny how when a party criticises another party , the criticised party remembers the faults of the criticising party , and uses them in a vague sort of argument .

  thanks a lot for this answer . 
  it brings some sense into this discussion and understand i 've missed some points . 
  i 'm not familiar with the subject and it 's the first time i 've heard about this in europe . 
  probably only some sorts of scarves would fit under a motorcycle helmet ( or driven by demand , helmet producers come with some innovations ) . 
  from all that i tried , 3m 8825 where the most comfortable and easiest to seal , but their price is quite high too . 
  also , from the marketing materials , the best seems to be bls zer0 31 c ( http://blsgroup.it/disposable/zero-series.html ) , but i could n't get my hands on it yet . 
  about my respro , i had the city , which is likely the worst . 
  do n't want to sound like a dipshit that has seen too many movies , but this seems like the sort of problem the state can easily solve with some undercover persons and hidden cameras . 
  it 's not like solving education , inequality or sending people to mars . 
  i also do n't get your irony with `` establishment approved source '' , you could expand if you want . 
  edit : typos, 
  had respro , do n't recommend it : uncomfortable and tends to seal improperly . 
  now i only wear industrial stuff ( ffp2 , ffp3 stuff , which are actual standards ) , which are also ** much ** cheaper . 
  this guy says the same : http://www.myhealthbeijing.com/china-public-health/respro-vs-totobobo-which-mask-works-better-for-air-pollution/, 
  / r/nottheonion , legit website : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/itv.com how can there be no conviction with 8000 + cases ? 
  i 've heard about this crap before , but i somehow believed it was a diminishing problem only present in a couple of african countries . 
  we deactivated them measurements stations in bucharest . 
  there 's no pollution if you ca n't measure it !!!, 
  now i regularly wear a filtering half mask ^ ( 1 ) when i 'm with the car or bicycle . 
  do you guys wear filters ? 
  because i see a business opportunity : i 'll setup a plant producing these things and sell the all over south-eastern europe . 
  ( 1 ) diesel soot is extremely small ( 2.5 micrometer ) , so these masks actually seem to filter at most 90 % : https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/57/3/360/231096/penetration-of-diesel-exhaust-particles-through edit : reddit formating, 
   because , like any self-respecting citizen , nobody knows more than the first stanza this . 
  i hate our lame anthem , but not being able to properly sing 12-16 lines is a whole other thing . 
  was free trade a relevant subject of brexit ? 
  is n't it a ( possible ) side effect most leave voters did n't even think about ?!, 
  it 's an honest question , i 'm not trying to make any argument . 
  source please . 
  and have a tendency to grow complacent . 
  bet 10 euros that in at most 2 years i 'll be in the street for a similar abuse of power ( and we 're not even done with the current one , i 'll keep going until the decision is published in the official journal ) . 
  jesus fucking christ , this is a thing : http://www.transportenvironment.org/press/governments-double-and-delay-air-pollution-limits-diesel-cars , http://www.airqualitynews.com/2015/10/28/eu-car-emissions-test-proposals-a-disgraceful-stitch-up/ i had no idea about this although i 'm one of those that sometimes wear particle filtering face masks . 
  i just kind of lost trust that * this * kind of institution is able to help romania with the current situation . 
  i intentionally forgot to mention that this `` better healthcare '' only applies to the western half of europe + greece . 
  the other half has the same proportions of diesel cars , only they 're a lot older and pass the emissions tests with bribes . 
  come to r/europe with us flag and point out our retarded habit of running soot generators in the city -  get downvotes . 
  i recommend that next time you point our cultural diversity , or the better healthcare ; or just anything good about eu :d, 
  damn . 
  for two days i have refrained from criticising the castle/cattle trend by saying the word kettle : \u201e do n't give the ideas !, 
  do n't give them ideas ! '' . 
  and it happened anyway . 
  a this moment about 13 of 25 top subjects on r/europe are cattle or castle . 
  could we have 2 sticky threads on these subjects and leave more space for other stuff ? 
  in good british humour , please make some absurd petition to `` ban all humans coloured orange and called donald trump from entering uk '' . 
  the undo the brexit vote , because i remembered about the david blaine episode and want you to remain in eu even more : http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/19/newsid_3700000/3700652.stm `` but others have taunted him relentlessly , even sending a burger up to the box on a remote-controlled helicopter . '', 
  while i 'm not interested enough to watch a full documentary , i 'll outline note some interesting stuff from the article : - online pornography websites ( `` tubes '' and `` cam girl '' ) call themselves `` technology companies '' . 
  that is , just like uber , google , facebook , they do n't actually generate the products/content , but take a huge share of the revenues . 
  - visiting porn sites is so ubiquitous that london transport authorities had to warn that they 'll report watchers to the police - children in france see their first porn film at age of 11 - porn actors make a lot less because of porn websites - cam girl are `` the new proletariat of sex '' , work a lot on it , and get around 15 % of the money, 
  to what benefit ? 
  uk is not yet out , and they do n't stand to gain much from eu having troubles . 
  conversely , stirring the wrath of france and germany would be bad for negotiations . 
  the right thing indeed , as this appears to be a quite simple ( and correct ) ruling : \u201e the possibility of their rights being violated or reduced regardless of the degree of guilt or the gravity of the crimes they are accused of does not allow the implementation of extradition rules '' . 
  so the turkish government wo n't be able to spin that in any way except \u201e bla bla terrorism , bla bla terrorism '' : `` once again greece , an ally and a neighbour , has failed to fulfill the basics of the fight against terrorism [ ... ] the impact of this decision thought to be made with political motives on our mutual ties , our cooperation in the fight against terrorism and our work on other mutual and regional issues will be subject to a comprehensive review .

  reddit makes statistics about eu countries with poor humour from downvotes to comments like this one  ), 
  this : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pxflg/europe_holds_its_destiny_in_its_own_hands/dcvn3jf/ and this : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pxflg/europe_holds_its_destiny_in_its_own_hands/dcvmecd/ while any guy who says `` democracy '' , `` proactive europe '' and `` common army '' ( or `` defence fund '' etc ) gets my attention straight away , there 's also the ability to deliver that is required . 
  i agree i exaggerated with `` amazing ; it 's because i was very surprised when reading about him . 
  until now i found every other administration pick to be appalling persons . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5prdm8/french_socialist_party_admits_to_manipulating_the/dctsyau/ there 's one now . 
  it appears correct , but my french is bad and i got bored by the end . 
  if the wikipedia page on james mattis is accurate , he is an ~ ~ amazing ~ ~ admirable person . 
  the opposite of the president , and , among the new administration people that i know of , he 's the only one i would trust . 
  nato at least should be safe , regardless of dt 's incoherent babble . 
  edit : agree i went overboard with the attribute , it 's the result of surprise that the new administration contains good people . 
  i read yesterday that soros scheming is a thing in hungary too ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-10/trump-s-win-prompts-hungarian-call-for-crackdown-on-soros-groups ) i was really expecting him to be one of the most respected hungarians . 
  self made man and finances schools . 
  how the hell do you spin that into something bad ? 
  i can understand it romania : he 's hungarian , rich , and the target audience does n't bother to check anything . 
  googled this debate . 
  that really happened . 
  ffs ( link , but i do n't recommend clicking it : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/11/pmqs-corbyn-cameron-osborne-boris-johnson-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-5732f7aee4b0a3721d605505#block-5732f7aee4b0a3721d605505 ) . 
  up with this thread !, 
  a city with 750,000 visitors per year for a population of 330000 . 
  will come this year to visit and put an end to my ignorance ( this is the first time i hear about this city in europe ) . 
  maybe i 'm a moron , but could n't eu invest heavily in greece , and have the commission send a brigade to check everything the government spends for 5 years ? 
  how much of a sovereignty scandal would that trigger ? 
  and i mean giving serious billions , not just another debt cut . 
  i believe it 's clear that the government is not up to dealing with such a bad situation . 
   greeks sent tens of billions abroad following the syriza win , plunging the country into two more years of recession . 
  what is this about ? 
  people moving money in tax-heavens or something else ? 
  oh , i knew about the order and justice party , they make it to top of r/europe from time to time . 
  i had no idea they used bicycles to demean something . 
  ** this shall not be forgotten **, 
  who is pis ? 
  so what what this extraordinary score that surprised you ? 
  cause that would be 5 upvotes , 4 downvotes :d, 
  translation from https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/5oicii/this_is_so_dutch_it_hurts_a_police_officer/dcjh7dy/ \u201e police is looking for a cyclist in rotterdam who gave an officer a ride during the chase of a suspect . 
  thanks to the mean sprint the cyclist had in his legs the suspect was apprehended . 
  it was a funny sight , an eyewitness tells us : a guy running away , a cyclist who goes after him , and a police offer who is chasing them on foot . 
  until a second cyclist joins the chase and yells ` jump on the back ! ' . 
  the officer does n't hesitate and jumps on . 
  a little while later they catch up to the suspect on rembrandtstraat .
