  he is arrested and gets a fine for driving without a license . 
  it 's the fifth time he 's caught : his scooter is impounded . 
  the cyclist continues on his journey : the police have no idea who he is . '', 
  wow , may seems ok , but got the wrong task . 
  i do n't know how good a politician and strategist you can be you must implement * this * . 
  i still have my doubts about keeping bojo around , but who knows ... 
  i think they 're almost doing it already . 
  oneplus is a chinese company and their products are already appealing . 
  sure , they 're using qualcomm soc , but there are guys like rockchip to produce that too . 
  probably more important are the likes of huawei , which i think are already biting into the market of high end communications equipment , but that 's not end-user , so i do n't have details . 
   albanians provoke serbs left and right , and yet when serbs do it one time - its laughable - trust me that i have 0 bias on this . 
  i 'm not aware of the albanians ' provocations , and would have laughed the same or more if it was kosovo painting a cheap train ( i 'm assuming they have a working railway company ) . 
  edit : despite being close to romania , i only know where kosovo , bosnia and montenegro are because last year i made contest at drawing the map of the world from memory with friends . 
  and you may paint me as an ignorant , but our area has depressingly little interesting stuff going on , apart from corruption and poverty . 
  my country only has the anticorruption directorate , some it industry , an only recently has started a photonuclear physics facility . 
  is this sarcasm or a turing test ? 
  because it makes no sense . 
  when everything will be much easier to produce , you 're suggesting to lower the living standards . 
  yeah , i believe you . 
  but the move is laughable no matter how you look at it : \u201e let 's send a message about our country by painting this 2 car dmu with a controversial statement '' . 
  how much is that type of train anyway , 1.5-2 million euro ? 
  maybe 3 million after you include the bribes so common to our area  ), 
  wow !, 
  imagine what would happen if they cared about having electrified rail instead of running a crappy diesel multiple unit with 2 cars . 
  these guys https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegrad_four#historical_background ? 
  currently it does n't look like they have any meaningful vision . 
  more like a sort of narcissistic group of individuals trying to frame eu institutions as part of `` rule the world '' conspiracy . 
  most likely such a group would have been a trainwreck waiting for russia to save it :d, 
  hats off to eu institution for wanting it a freer market by fixing a bit of this thing : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/information_asymmetry, 
  really do n't understand the minuses , you 've accurately described internet users , even experienced ones . 
  last week i 've had a discussion with a very technical guy ( he does opengl magic ) and convinced him to at least a sort of tracking protection like privacy badger : - why do you think skype shows you ads for stuff you just searched in your browser on that online shop ? 
  - uhmmm , i do n't care ? 
   ok yeah , that sound pretty bad ( sounds a lot like our berlusconi lol ) . 
  but in terms of european policies what is the stance of the romanian alde ? 
  in a quick search i could n't find their stance on the european policies . 
  i expect the ep group to be quite pro-eu , while the national group rhetoric will strictly be whatever suits them best at the moment : - anti-eu because of limits to the budget deficit ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/politica/alegeri-parlamentare-2016/tariceanu-vrea-pact-politic-pentru-deficit-bugetar-de-peste-3-610476 which i 'll sum up us : \u201e 3 % is too low , the westerners do n't let us develop '' ) - pro-eu if signing some deal which benefits government 's image - anti-eu whenever some eu official praises about the anti-corruption directorate . 
   1 ) if alde will accept them ( i think yes because verhofstadt needs the votes to try and become president of the european parliament ) alde has accepted the romanian alde ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_ ( romania ) ) which is the lowest type of scum that have entered our parliament in 2016 elections . 
  it was formed by a merger of a so called liberal party with a `` conservative party '' ( political vehicle of a famous romanian oligarch now in jail ) . 
  poor results while a pm , bad/illegal deals , anti law , anti democracy . 
  compared to the romanian alde , m5s is quite honourable . 
  not : my understanding and explanation of the situation is lacking , / u/giuvanni explained below why romanian alde is now in the alde group : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mxa2m/m5s_votes_to_leave_euroskeptic_group_and_to_join/dc75asl/, 
  you guys rule , i never rode below -15 c. 
  we never get such low temperatures here , and i 'm curious how my gloves and boots would under such weather . 
  how 's cyclists ' life in moscow ? 
  i somehow thought of moscow as a cars ' kingdom , complete with motorcades and road rage , and those pictures show boulevards closed for a bicycle event . 
  i 'll also ashamedly admit that i initially ignored this piece because it had moscow in the title . 
  i 've let my antipathy for russian government and putin take over :(, 
  it 's per kilometre for euro6 cars and trucks/buses , have a look at the study they cite : http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/euro-vi-versus-6_icct_briefing_06012017.pdf, 
  the data in the study is staggering : - euro6 truck : 0.21 g/km nox - euro6 car : 0.48 g/km nox http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/euro-vi-versus-6_icct_briefing_06012017.pdf without considering the diesel particulate , this thing is n't a simple fuck-up . 
  it 's a disaster that took years of hard work to create . 
  i often wear an ffp3 respirator for diesel particles , because i feel that smoke quite readily in my chest . 
  but the respirator does n't protect from gases ; i do n't even have an idea of how nox smells , but now i learn it can give me cancer . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_lions another british take at a similar subject . 
  one of the ** best ** comedies i 've seen . 
  the youtube trailer of this real housewives of isis does n't seem that well made , but i 'll surely search a uk proxy to watch a couple of episodes :d edit : missing adjective . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc was the sensation of last year for me . 
  tell them to keep doing it and you 're on the right track, 
  never heard of this stereotype until now . 
  adding it right now to my book of 100 % correct facts about other peoples :d, 
  i was objecting to the term `` private company '' , which quite unambiguously means that its stock is not publicly traded . 
  ikea is an example of private company . 
  going on your line of thinking , the public may be up to 57 % mad , because `` institutional investors '' may well mean public and qatar holding llc is state owned ( assuming vw never got public financing or preferential treatment by politicians ) . 
  oh , and great that i get downvotes for actual factual information . 
  / u / _ cowl already contains the answer !, 
  * eu institutions knew manufacturers were cheating but they closed their eyes ; * ec has pushed blindly for co2 reduction which gave diesel an advantage . 
  if the commission cared about the science of harmful ** diesel particles and nox ** instead of pushing a political purpose , they would have found out that the game rules are difficult to follow and * invite * to criminal activity . 
  that 's actually a nice idea . 
  i should start looking at how these systems work . 
  all my payments to those german bicycle shops were confirmed by the shop the same day or next working day . 
  and i may be a scrooge , but for 6 euros saved last time i was more than willing to copy paste those code into the internet banking page ( admittedly , all those websites i listed process the codes themselves , that 's why i did n't have to hunt the confirmations ) . 
  financing in parties with such big debts looks to me like pushing the borders of moral . 
  becasue i do n't see how they are going to pay all the money back ; will they have more contributing members after they get more popular ? 
  and reaching into the tens of millions with campaign expenses , looks so prone to conflicts of interest . 
  that kind of money can come from hundreds of thousands of members or from `` entities '' who are making an economic investment ( i.e. 
  they expect benefits at least as big as the donation ) . 
  ooooh , that 's not the main reason to be more moderate about taking all your information from and exposing all your life to * this kind of * for-profits . 
  how about : * if you use social media as it 's supposed to , you 're scrolling hours a day , to the detriment of your career at least * they 're made to please you , so you 'll mostly be exposed to stuff that agree with . 
  which takes us to * the spread of false/biased articles . 
  when i was using it , i was regularly seeing the kind of news that pleased me ( anti putin/trump/church / conservatives/communists ) but which where of low quality . 
  i think facebook makes this a lot worse than any other aggregator style platform . 
  * the way these companies may know a lot * about the * people than * the * people themselves : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pfx2p7jlwa added a few missing words . 
  thanks a lot . 
  i 've never thought of the euro as `` the tool '' to make federation necessary ; instead saw it as a small building block to make all integration easier . 
  on a personal level i 've obviously seen only the good points : * a stable currency to keep around in case things went to shit . 
  they did pretty often in the first 15 years of democracy ; 200-300 % inflation scares the shit out of you . 
  before the euro there was a mix of dem , usd and maybe gbp , which were less readily usable . 
  things are more stable now , but euro is still used as an universal tool to compare prices and make exchanges . 
  * a way to make online payments through sepa , without paying visa exchange and trusting third party payment operators . 
  * not having hard to use left-over foreign currency every time i go abroad . 
  still faster than bicycle . 
  the best guys i know would need some 10 hours :d, 
  has someone taken the budapest-bucharest route recently ? 
  that idiotic system of separate border controls , stopping the train at both lokoshaza and curtici , is still in place ? 
   it 's actually a very familiar concept for apple : if you want to access their apple store and sell products , you pay for it . 
  30 % even . 
  the most apt analogy i 've seen in a long time . 
  maybe not even an analogy but an equivalence . 
  sorry , `` bragging '' was a badly chosen . 
  i 've always thought of the police as an essential yet somewhat discreet public service . 
  everything to go hell if they 're missing , but at the same time not getting much publicity on actions that trigger political discussion ( both from the likes of green party 's simone peter and the anti-pc superheroes from everywhere ) .
