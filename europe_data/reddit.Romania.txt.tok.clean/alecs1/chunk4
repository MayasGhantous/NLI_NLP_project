  hear hear . 
  ruining the night ( if even that ) for a few hundred young males is highly preferable to letting hundred of women be molested . 
  i still disagree with bragging on twitter using a new term , but they already admitted it 's wrong . 
  i 'm a bit surprised at the amount of publicity the the police gets though . 
  love it !, 
  it 's a famous movie with important prizes won , so there 's no surprise . 
  most romanians i know have seen it at least once ; it 's classic comedy and also pretty easy to relate to . 
  i first saw it when i was 15 . 
  there 's another famous film i say when i was 15 : underground ; understood nothing of it . 
  had to see it again years later to get the point . 
   federalism really is the only game in town the eu , everything else is subservient to that goal - the euro , the regulations , the courts , the treaties , the lot . 
  the uk from the outset was always going to lose the fight for any alternative vision for the future of europe that was not subservient to that goal . 
  could you go a bit deeper with the explanation here , a few examples ? 
  given the small current common budget and individual veto rights , i really see `` federalism '' as extremely distant and continuously shifting into the future , but i could change perspective on some things related to integration . 
  rant : kinda hate how reddit works for me : until i make time to read articles in the backlog , all the interesting discussion has already happened and users have moved on to other stuff . 
  as far fetched as it seemed to me , this is correct !, 
  had to google it to convince myself : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#most_visited_destinations_by_international_tourist_arrivals i expected the huge territory countries to be first , in approximate order : china , usa , brazil . 
   two years of western economic sanctions have made the situation worse . 
  could someone expand on this ? 
  how much does the government invest in siberia or give social assistance to the poor ? 
  how much did it decrease due to slowed economy ? 
  i 'd have expected `` western sanctions '' to have little effect in the remote regions . 
  le : moron replying to himself : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis#effect_on_russia if the currency goes down or inflation up , everyone is poorer and the poorest are especially affected . 
  wow , lots of certainties . 
  how about it being something personal , for family or friends he lost in allepo ? 
  let me for 1 second forget that this is click bait with little content ( 1 source admitting difficulties ) : how should nato break the silence ? 
  yes , it appears deleted . 
  any idea why ? 
  that staging is so retarded . 
  le : it 's so idiotic it seems neither opposition staging , nor a pis plant . 
  much better , thank you . 
   there 's video footage of a guy casually sitting down into a lying position next to a smoke grenade and pretending he has been beaten up . 
  which you shared with us through the power of mind instead of web links . 
  a + information sharing on reddit . 
  similar to the coaches in trenhotel ? 
  with self guided wheels and stuff ? 
  sure we care . 
  here are two other good summaries : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5iqut4/brief_summary_of_the_current_situation_in_polish/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/17/protesters-block-polands-parliament-as-political-crisis-escalates?cmp=share_btn_tw, 
  sorry , you were 4 hours late . 
  the good sounding nonsense got all the upvotes already . 
   a nation with a sense of identity would n't allow all that happening from the beginning . 
  edit : made clear i appreciate the comment . 
  when were the articles written and what was the story about ? 
  ( pretty sure it 's stupidity here , since they edited the engine too , but left a knee , and the other black guy in ) . 
  i think i have to buy some gold for this of answers, 
  really hope these tests have flaws that make romanians do bad . 
  otherwise , it does n't look too good for us . 
  i 'm particularly worried about reading , how goddam hard are those tests that those kids do so poorly at understanding a text ?!, 
  need to take some tests myself , them better be difficult as hell . 
  sorry to disappoint , french politics are not that visible from romania * . 
  all i know is from wikipedia , / r/europe and buying le monde from airports . 
  * this is partially a good thing . 
  we know a lot more about some other guys : they had the electoral campaign last 2 years , of which about 20 minutes where dedicated to serious policy debate . 
  russia is a state mafia dystopia : if you ever confronted the system , you better never blink because you 'll get shot . 
  instead of improving life for the citizens , it 'll spend resources invading neighbours \u201e in self defense '' and activating pawns from all over europe for anti-west propaganda . 
  america merely has an out of control legal system ( for deceit and destruction of evidence you 'd go to jail , instead you 're elected president ) where everything is solved out of court , too much influence of large business in administration , and poor media ( see cnn , fox and various conspiracy lunatics ) . 
  did you ask this just to see / r/europe users admit america is better than russia ? 
  that 's kind of obvious . 
  cool , to me this guy is the most inspiring french politician ( 1800 km away , mediocre french ) . 
  looks like a realistic person , increased the pension contribution period , defended laicite and i remember he did n't rush into demagoguery or knee jerk administrative decisions after the massacres . 
  these are sigma 10514 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigma-class_corvette ) ships , which are quite large at 2300 tons . 
  our main concern is russia , after attacking ukraine , but i guess that would rather suggest frigates . 
  2 frigates are planned too , but i guess the decision was to start with the cheaper stuff . 
  as to how good this decision was , i do n't have any expertise . 
  ** romania ** * will spend 1.6 billion euros on building 4 corvettes with dutch company damen * will start building 8x8 armoured vehicles in partnership with german company rheinmetall * we bitched a lot when someone at the italian space agency blamed schiaparelli 's crash on a romanian company , arca . 
  we already knew arca were con artists , that esa would n't base its programs on a shit company , but we still bitched . 
  * couple more former corruption big shots sent to jail * opinion polls show that a young modernising party usr may get  10 % parliament seats, 
  is government change really that significant in italy 's economic growth ? 
  italy is an already industrialised and developed country , so you 've already picked the low hanging fruits . 
  if inefficiencies due to corruption are low * , the only things bringing fast growth seem to be population health and the high tech industry * i 'm not at all knowledgeable about this , i only know the ndragheta toxic and nuclear waste scandals surface from time to time, 
  we go to / r/all again ? 
  up with it then . 
  i 'm not sure why juncker is the image of someone else 's opinion piece ... 
  otherwise i agree with the comments before . 
  seems like the cure proposed in the article is worse than the disease : creates dependency for some countries and could also bring discord about how you compute the level of compensation . 
  as for juncker , i 'm euro optimist and love his antics , but i think we should put him to pasture . 
  i do n't think ec works close to its potential . 
  i love the idea of having a bit of accountability . 
  but it wo n't happen . 
  this one does quite well i could say : the sun doxxed the shit out of him * on 15 may , and it is exactly what the independent reports in this this article from 21 may . 
  they just miss the irony of posting his info themselves . 
  * please search it yourself `` the nhs cyber attack hero '' , i get spam filtered if i post the link . 
  true . 
  on a second watch i believe they solved the situation efficiently and would have done even better were they a little fitter :d, 
  i do n't get these references , are they from a movie ? 
  or did i misunderstand and this is not a joke ? 
  what did i just see ? 
  were those thugs in costumes turkish security kicking people in usa ? 
  if yes , it 's the one time in my life i think the us police were too soft . 
  i was n't comparing them directly , but , indeed , f35 got a lot more attention and almost universally american subjects get much more coverage than others . 
  do n't know about social media , the only thing i use similar to social media is our reddit . 
  why would the british leave european military projects ? 
  considering this specific case , the f-35 , maybe they 'd might consider even more cooperation . 
  if delays and costs increases of f35 repeat in other us led projects , integrating more with european partners seems like a good idea . 
   are you familiar with turkish politics enough to have any idea what you 're talking about ? 
  why should he be familiar with anything ? 
  adevland 's statements are correct without him needing to know anything about turkey . 
  \u201e jailed for ** alleged ** ties to the coup '' describes the situation perfectly ( unless that article is wrong and those people where not really arrested , but instead sent to wonderland or the chocolate factory ) . 
  or should one post a link about turkey only if he is turkish or something ? 
  thank you .
