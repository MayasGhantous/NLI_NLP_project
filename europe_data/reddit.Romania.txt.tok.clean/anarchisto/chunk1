jos\u00e9 manuel barroso is also an ex-communist . 
  fruits boiled in water . 
  you can drink/eat it fresh or put in a jar for winter time . 
  the prices are high because the wages are also high . 
  when a mcdonald 's employee has a wage of more than $ 21/h , it 's expected that the prices are also high . 
  the taxes are n't very high in norway compared with most of europe . 
  it 's owned by a finnish company , but according to wikipedia :  the newspaper is typically given out for free at places english-language `` expats '' attend , including hotels , caf\u00e9s and restaurants , as well as by subscription , though it is being increasingly read by english-speaking russians, 
   the amount of countries that ban any chance on secession are smaller than you think . 
  most countries which have regions wanting to secede have bans against secession . 
  the eu regulates the shape of bananas . 
  yes , but historically , it was used to refer to romanians . 
  i suppose that `` ol\u00e1h cig\u00e1nyok '' were romanian-speaking gypsies . 
  in hungarian , `` olasz '' means italian , while `` ol\u00e1h '' means romanian . 
  both words are derived from the same slavonic root ( \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0445\u044a / vlach ) . 
  italy has the lowest percentage of people in any western europe country who use the internet . 
  free wifi would definitely increase that number . 
   1.2 billion people on this planet live on less than $ 1 a day . 
  2.8 billion people live on less than $ 2 dollars a day . 
  their lives would be infinitely better anywhere in europe . 
   there are many people ( quite a few million people ) who live on less than $ 1 or $ 2 a day in europe , too , even in the european union . 
  ( romania and bulgaria , mostly ) . 
  the minimum gross wage in ukraine is 73.8 $ / month . 
  imagine a family of three ( a single mother with two kids ) living from a minimum wage . 
  that 's less than $ 1/day/person . 
  and that 's a person `` lucky '' to have a job . 
  if you 're unemployed , it 's much worse .

  this is the average income . 
  i suppose this is affected by the relatively few , but very well-paid people working in the financial industry in the city . 
  i wonder if things are different for the median income .

   we used to watch a lot of italian tv back then since we did n't have much of our own . 
  same here in romania . 
  that 's how i 'm speaking pretty well italian . 
  the united states has a national redistribution of wealth through government jobs , social security , minimum wage , etc. 
  the european union does n't have any such thing . 
  for instance , a government employee in romania may have a wage of 300-400 $ , while in denmark may have 3000-4000 $ . 
  ten times more for basically the same job . 
  in the united states , these government jobs are paid relatively similar wages throughout the country . 
  the difference between the poor in western europe/america and the poor in eastern europe is that the latter ca n't afford the kind of food which makes the former fat . 
  the poor in eastern europe ca n't afford fast food , they do their own cooking . 
   what 's stopping these roma gypsies from improving their condition and developing the same standards as romanians ? 
  plenty of reasons : discrimination in employment and education , lack of any social programs , carelessness from anyone in the administration . 
   are the romanian government not engaging in social , educational and development programmes to improve the roma 's condition ? 
  they spend money on this , but the practical result is zero . 
  organizing a conference on roma integration at a five-star hotel is not going to do anything to actually integrate them , even though in the budget this would be in the `` roma integration '' chapter . 
  but there are different kinds of poverty . 
  [ according to eurostat  ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/children_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion ) in sweden , 0.1 % of children do n't get enough proteins . 
  in romania , 29 % of children do n't get enough proteins . 
  that does n't contradict my title . 
  this is `` child poverty in romania '' . 
   in 1930 there were 750k , in 1948 340k , much of the difference is that many romanian germans were resettled by hitler in occupied poland . 
  they are not stateless . 
  they have romanian , bulgarian , hungarian , slovakian etc. 
  citizenship , from the country they were born into . 
  some of them do n't have any papers because their parents did n't registered them when they were born . 
  however , they are still romanian citizens , so they could get documents if they knew or were helped to follow the proper bureaucratic procedures . 
  probably because they buy second-hand cars from germany and they do n't register here because they do n't want to pay the registration tax . 
  in places where the water level is just a few meters below the soil , it 's common to have wells in every yard . 
  there are big differences between slavery and serfdom . 
  roma slaves were sold at auctions , slaveholders broke families and sold them separately , they were kept in chains , they were tortured , young girls were bought and used as sex slaves , etc. 
  also , because this happened as late as the 1850s , their condition is very well documented by the groups demanding their emancipation . 
  it 's not even hundreds of meters away . 
  in most villages , the pit toilets are in the backyard , while the wells are in the front yard , often 10-20 meters away . 
   it 's not nearly as bad as it sounds though . 
  yes , it is . 
  people in the same villages where they have pit toilets drink water from polluted shallow water wells . 
  apart from the hygienic concerns of contamination , there 's also the problem of nitrates pollution in the drinking water , particularly in the case of infants . 
  i 've seen bluish paint in villages . 
  i do n't know why , maybe because it was cheaper ? 
   how do you think villages got segregated in the first place ? 
  some villages have been seggregated for hundreds of years , back when the roma people were slaves and kept outside the main village . 
  other villages were originally romanian , but when the roma started to move , the romanians left the village . 
   this album gives a much more representative view of what life in romanian villages is truly like . 
  that looks more like a tourist brochure , suggesting that romanian countryside is such a nice and idyllic place . 
  of course there are some nice places , but poverty is very widespread . 
  pretending there is no poverty does not make it go away . 
  the roma people left the border area between india and pakistan almost a thousand years ago , during the muslim invasion of india . 
  they reached the balkans around 1200 ad and they were enslaved . 
  slavery was abolished in bulgaria and serbia by the ottoman invasion , but romanian lands kept their autonomy within the ottoman empire , so roma slavery lasted until 1856 . 
  ( [ see wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) ) . 
  at least half of european roma are the descending from former slaves in romania who were either runaway slaves or freed slaves who left the country . 
  they have pretty much the same social problems as other groups who were former slaves , such as the african-americans in the us . 
  widespread discrimination , pure hatred from the majority and their distinct nomadic culture make them quite difficult to assimilate . 
  the villages did not get much investment during the communist era , as ceau\u0219escu wanted to urbanize romania . 
  the proportion of urban dwellers grew from 20 % to 50 % , but the other half which still remained in the villages did not have any improvement in their living standards . 
  after 1989 , it was even worse , with investment focusing on bigger cities . 
  which part ? 
  [ a poor romanian village looks like this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bnq8eei0paq/tmyeguqeaoi/aaaaaaaabtk/n6x1qmkbxwg/s1600/sat.jpg ) . 
  apart from being cleaner ( they have no rubbish thrown around ) , they look pretty similar and they surely have a similar quality of life . 
  also , they speak romanian language as their native language . 
  [ that was a decade ago . 
  i found some more recent stats ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/mapdata.do?toolbox=data&amp;tab=map&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tessi294&amp;language=en&amp;r=1406772968434 ) : share of total population not having indoor flushing toilet for the sole use of their household ( source : silc ) ( 2013 ) * sweden 0 % * germany 0.1 % * spain 0.1 % * uk 0.2 % * france 0.5 % * czech republic 0.9 % * italy 1.1 % * poland 3 % * bulgaria 21 % * romania 34 %, 
  that kind of village is not integrated into the mainstream economy . 
  the solution would be to have some kind of normal jobs in the area . 
  i know the typical politician would just recommend them to `` get a job '' , but they ca n't because there are no jobs . 
  romania has a serious lack of jobs , leading to millions of romanians to flee the country to work in other countries in the eu . 
  estimates say that around 3-4 million romanians left the country in the last few years . 
  for instance , italy and spain have each over a million romanians officially registered as living there . 
  also , for the few low-level jobs there are available , there are so many applicants ( hundreds or thousands ) , that they 'd have no chance , particularly due to discrimination .
