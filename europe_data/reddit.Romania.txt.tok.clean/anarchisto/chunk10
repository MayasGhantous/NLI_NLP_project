  the anarchist society is supposed to be peaceful , i do n't think there 's going to be much debate over that , but we 're not talking about that now . 
  there are groups who think that the response towards state 's violence should not be non-violent . 
  they do n't consider violence part of their ideology , but rather part of their tactics . 
  while i do n't agree with it ( i think propaganda is much more important ) , i do n't disown them as being non-anarchists . 
   that 's not what anarchism is , they are n't anarchists and while they keep throwing molotovs they 'll never be there are some anarchists who argue that some violence ** may ** be acceptable in some cases ; for instance , see [ peter gelderloos ' argumentation on `` how nonviolence helps the state '' ] ( http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-how-nonviolence-protects-the-state ) . 
  even if you disagree with the idea , it 's a good read . 
  it 's often the case that every other country except for the uk agrees with something , but it wo n't be done because the uk opposes it . 
  no , it 's because no one builds anything in spain anymore . 
  there are empty and unfinished building projects everywhere along the coast . 
  romania . 
  we have carrefour ( fr ) , kaufland / lidl ( de ) , billa ( at ) , auchan ( fr ) , cora / mega image ( delhaize group , be ) , but no tescos . 
  in europe , i guess carrefour and lidl are more widespread than tesco . 
  also , our politicians are idiots and they do n't know how to receive bribes without getting caught . 
  like that guy from cluj who was just arrested : he had records for all the bribes he received in a notebook he kept in his desk . 
  it 's not just her , it 's a whole generation of judges and prosecuters . 
  one person may help , but one can not change a whole system . 
  the justice system is finally starting to be independent and fair , however , the problem is that the quality of politicians is not improving . 
  the same kind of people over and over . 
  for instance , in a city in romania , the mayor of r\u00e2mnicu-v\u00e2lcea was convicted for receiving a bribe , the people elected a new mayor and the new mayor got caught , too . 
  similarly , the mayor of the transylvanian city of cluj was arrested and two years later the president of the cluj county council got caught . 
  the political system is preventing honest people from getting inside because they could become majority and that 's dangerous for their businesses . 
  the parties kick out any person which is not willing to accept their corrupt ways . 
  yes , it was a requirement and the agency was opened in 2002 , a few years before joining the eu in 2007 . 
  however it only started to have some actual results ( big names being convicted ) two years ago . 
  the reason ? 
  a new generation of young judges who are more dedicated to their job and less likely to be willing to receive bribes . 
  indeed , in cyprus there was illegal colonization of an occupied territory as well . 
  for the us , geographical redistribution of wealth is helping a lot to keep the productivity high across all states . 
  for instance , government jobs are a great equalizer in the us , helping the poor states . 
  however , in the eu this is not the case : a french postman gets 2000 $ / month , whereas a romanian postman gets a 200 $ / month . 
  local businesses here can not develop without a local market and there is no market when the purchasing power is so low . 
  i 'd argue not without massive geographical redistribution of wealth . 
  the us is more homogenous than the eu ( thus helping growth ) due to a continuous redistribution from the `` rich '' states to the `` poor '' states . 
  the eu has less redistribution and the kind of redistribution ( mostly to grants for businesses , infrastructure and government ) does n't drip down to the people . 
  romania and malta are the only two countries to have mps only in two groups . 
  ( epp , s&d ) . 
  ( romania also has an independent candidate , but he was supported by the social-democrats ), 
   its still my impression that northern food is a lot more salty and fat . 
  i doubt you have something as salty as anchovies , which is a traditional mediterranean food . 
  against the repressive policies of the turkish government . 
  but this is the way european politics work . 
  every country is trying to get regulations that benefit them : * the uk cares about financial deregulation * germany and france care about industry regulations * france and spain care about agriculture subsidies . 
  etc, 
  cartoon physics !, 
  people here spoil their ballot because they do n't trust the people who handle the ballots after the election : a blank ballot can be turned into a valid ballot , but a spoilt ballot can not be . 
  yes , we can !, 
  there are plenty of people here who say `` vote blank '' . 
  what 's silly is the chorus of people who claim that this is anti-democratic and that in democracy you must choose someone . 
  i think i 'll stay at home . 
  i have to choose between : * one very corrupt `` social-democratic '' party ( also supporting neoliberal ideas , currently in power ) * 5 corrupt `` christian-democratic '' neoliberal parties * one corrupt and illiberal `` liberal '' party * one hungarian party * one `` socialist '' party which is made out of senile people who still send kim and the north korean communist party telegrams congratulating them for whatever successes they have * 3 parties of ceau\u0219escuists ( far right-wingers/nationalists with a socialist view ) * 2 parties of greens , with dubious past and dubious doctrine ( unlike the progressive european greens , these guys are anti-gay ) * a party made by a tabloid journalist who has some absurd promises , like giving 20.000 euros to every romanian * a number of religious nuts who want to outlaw homosexuality , ban abortion and sex education and , in one case , get closer to mother russia , the saviour of orthodoxy from western decadence . 
  * a guy who was involved in some bank fraud a decade ago which resulted in the bankruptcy of a local bank * another guy who was involved in some real-estate fraud * [ a former gymnast who posed nude in the local edition of playboy ] ( http://www.nudesportsstars.com/contents/corina_ungureanu/corina_ungureanu02.jpg ) i tend to think that the gymnast is the only honest person in the whole list . 
   all eastern european states have a slavic language   eastern european country economy levels are very low ( romania being the richest with ~ $ 9.000 gdp per capita if you include romania in eastern europe , then the first thing about having slavic language is wrong . 
  also , russia ( which is definitely eastern european ) is a bit richer than romania . 
   a start would be not electing right-wing populists . 
  romania had no `` right-wing populists '' in power during the last 20 years . 
  neither did greece . 
  the doctors leave simply because the western european countries have higher wages and a better standard of living . 
   isds means that investors can take legal action against the country hosting its investment , without the intervention of the government of the investor 's home country . 
  they 've been trying similar ideas for decades , but they always gave up due to public pressure . 
  who knows , maybe this time they 'll be able to pass it through . 
  `` investor protection '' means that no new environmental or health regulations can be made without huge costs to the governments . 
  in order to be able to pass those new environmental or health standards , the governments will have to pay a ransom to every company that is affected by it , thereby moving the risk from the multinational corporations and putting it to the government . 
   you ca n't change the debt problem without either defaulting or inflating , and both are terrible options . 
  you ca n't inflate your debt if your debt is in a currency you ca n't control ( $ or $ ) . 
  apart from the government debt , hungary had a nasty case of household debt in swiss francs . 
  within the framework of the european union , no , he ca n't do much , which makes the power grab pointless . 
  but people see that orban is trying to do something and doing something beats doing nothing . 
  well , for greece it 's a big deal , their economy collapsed due to their debt and austerity caused by it . 
  hungary is not far behind having a similar fate . 
  * it needs many wells ( much more than regular gas extraction ) and each well must have a road access , so you 're going to build a lot of roads . 
  ( see [ pic1 ] ( http://commonsensecanadian.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/texas-fracking-aerial_.jpg ) , [ pic2 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mqhvp_l0qp8/uohzen0wxui/aaaaaaaaaea/ciokwk0uebi/s1600/jonah.jpg ) , [ pic3 ] ( http://www.link2portal.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/lead_image_600/shale-gas-30112.jpg ) ) * it uses much more land than coal , a part of this land is forested , so there 's going to be substantial deforestation . 
  ( for wells and roads ) * large water usage , this will have to be extracted and transported , dozens or more kilometers in trucks . 
  * it may poison wells ( the `` scientific truth '' tends to be skewed by the big money in this business ) and it definitely affects the health of the local residents near the extraction wells . 
  hungary is in a rather difficult economic situation : * huge external debt ( higher than all other eastern european countries ) * slow economic growth * the economy is basically owned by foreigners ( particularly austrians and germans ) since the left-wing parties proved to be quite corrupt , the people chose the right-wing fidesz . 
  unlike populists in other countries , fidesz actually tried to change something . 
  they realized that they were basically powerless in changing anything significant , so they attempted to grab any power that was available . 
  they changed the constitution to make it less liberal ( with some outcries from within and outside the country ) , they tried to get the national bank under government control ( the eu made it clear they 're not allowed to do that ) , they changed the way the elections work ( to make it sure they 'll not lose the next elections ) etc. 
  no , it 's pushing the eu towards shale gas , which is worse for the environment than coal . 
  yeah , but you call it `` the sky mountain '' ( himmelbjerget ) . 
  advertising is everything !, 
  or god 's punishment for cutting down too many trees . 
  forests may prevent flood by storing water which would otherwise simply flow downhill . 
   and once again , people confuse romas with romanians ... 
  they are romanian citizens . 
  this `` they 're not us '' is racism . 
  it does n't happen for romanians of partial ancestry from european countries because their ancestry is not visibile . 
  no one ever claims that people who have some polish , greek or even turkish ancestry are not romanians . 
  chechnya has a population of 1 million and the russians had heavy casualties and a never-ending war . 
  poland has a population of 38 million . 
  i do n't mean that . 
  i mean resistance , guerrilla . 
   a lot of people define crimea also as non-attack . 
  because it was unconventional . 
  russia could easily do the same to a bunch of eu countries . 
  do you really think that the people of poland or the baltic countries will just stay and let them be annexed by russia ? 
  the way i know the poles , half of the country would up in arms leading a guerrilla against the pro-russian troops . 
  that 's part of the lebensraum , so it 's ok . 
  that monthly wage can out-do more than 99 % of workers in eastern europe . 
  the eu did n't any sign `` investment protection '' treaty yet , despite all the attempts from the multinationals during the last 30 years . 
   spain is dragging the average down a little though .
