  we 're becoming less reliant on the us by using huge sums to buy american military hardware ? 
  the standard of living for the romanian people is low enough that we had 3 million leave the country towards western europe , with other hundreds of thousands leaving every year . 
  eventually , there wo n't be anyone left to pay for the expensive american rockets we 're using the money . 
  why do you think there are communists in russia ? 
  all i can see is an oligarchy . 
   a lot of the issues you mention are also due to a poor work ethic yeah , i heard the same old argument : it 's the poor people 's fault that they 're poor . 
  it 's funny that the moment they leave the country ( like 3 million romanians already did ) , they stop being lazy . 
   neither halves has fond memories of the good ol' soviet times , though . 
  [ oh , really ? 
  46 % say they 'd vote for ceau\u0219escu . 
  yes , it 's not the lack of money . 
  we have enough money to fix everything within a few years , but the money is not even used to solve these issues at all . 
  our governments prefer to spend money on contracts ( including defense contracts ) , where they can get a percentage of the contract ( usually 10-20 % ) as bribe . 
  good job . 
  romania is the country where : * a third of the people do n't have running water ( relying on unprotected wells , often full of pesticides and bacteria ; the highest percentage in europe ) * 32.6 % of the people do n't have indoor plumbing or flushing toilets ( relying on outhouses/latrines that poison the unprotected wells used for drinking water ) . 
  [ eurostat , 2016 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tessi294&amp;plugin=1 ) * in bucharest there are still hundreds of streets without any sewerage . 
  * 46 % of the children are in poverty . 
  [ eurostat , 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion ) * there are still malnourished children due to having an inadequate welfare system . 
  * 4.7 million people live with `` severe material deprivation '' ( i.e. 
  absolute poverty , not relative poverty ) [ eurostat , 2016 ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_mddd11&amp;lang=en ) -- and the number is slightly higher than in 2015 . 
  * the lowest percentage of gdp ( within the eu ) used for healthcare , resulting in the largest percentage ( within the eu ) of `` unnecessary deaths '' in hospitals due to inadequate funding . 
  [ world bank , 2014 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.xpd.totl.zs?view=map ) but yes , our priority is to spend $ 4 billion for some rockets and some more billions for some second-hand planes . 
  from the point of view of the corrupt , they feel they can do it because they are strong and the people are weak . 
  the southern european ( and eastern european , too ) governments are not weak , they 're unwilling to go after the rich . 
  it 's all part of the corrupt system of power in these countries . 
   unemployed or badly paid workers from romania or bulgaria find well-paid jobs in western europe . 
  what about the well-paid workers from romania who find even better paid jobs in western europe ? 
  no , idomemo\u0219 , near pia\u021ba victoriei . 
  i once spent three days sick in bed after eating at a turkish restaurant in bucharest . 
  well , after that , the west had coffee . 
  you ca n't fight without coffee . 
   most of them have returned and almost all of them were sending the money they made in spain back to their families in romania . 
  no , they did n't . 
  there are millions who moved to western europe ( particularly spain and italy ) , who bought a house there , who had children there , children who often do n't speak much romanian . 
  they 're coming once in a while for holiday and that 's all . 
  out-migration from romania is continuing to this day , at a lower pace ( the net out-migration was around 200.000 people last year ) . 
  what makes you think they 'll go back to ukraine ? 
  it 's very easy for ukrainians to integrate into polish society for cultural and linguistic reasons . 
  the only loser is the ukrainian state that is going to be a depopulated economic wasteland . 
  the law is one thing , the enforcement of those laws is a different thing . 
  are the figures correct ? 
  unemployment this low should mean rapidly growing wages . 
  then there are people who do n't take holidays because they 're afraid of being fired ... 
   they also drank mostly goats milk and not cows milk . 
  it depends on the region . 
  in the mediterranean , they had mostly goats . 
  in the mountains , they had mostly sheep . 
  in the plains , they had mostly cows . 
   people simply do n't want 2 or more kids . 
  the article is about the measured sperm counts , not about desired family size . 
  do n't worry . 
  pre-industrial shepherds had no problem having 6-8 children despite a diet based mostly on milk and cheese . 
  well , the azeri are very close culturally to turks . 
  if i recall correctly , their languages are mutually intelligible and could be considered dialects of the same language . 
   that 's actually pretty hopeful for the future . 
  the only hope is to have a wide and independent middle-class . 
  currently , we have two classes : * a large precariat -- voting for the `` social-democratic '' mafia , because they are only ones who give some small crumbs ( minimum wage increases , pensions increases ) to them * a small middle-class -- voting for liberals who want to withdraw even the small crumbs ( remove all social welfare , privatize healthcare and education , stop any minimum wage increases or remove it completely , etc. ), 
  the precariat will never vote for those liberals , even if they were not corrupt . 
  moderate social-democrats or christian democrats would have some chances , but the middle-class does n't want to help in any way the `` lazy people '' ( which includes minimum-wage workers , because if they were not lazy , they would get a big wage , right ? ) . 
   when the local population/authorities/police are fed up with them they can effectively end it . 
  or it can turn into a stable system like in southern italy . 
   holy shit how does this happen in 21st century in somewhat civilized country ?? 
  same thing happens in romania , except that it 's more of a decentralized mafia . 
  ( there 's no strongman here , just wannabe strongmen who get taken down by the secret services if they get too much power ), 
  they could run burger king on thyme ? 
  tabloids of europe series ? 
   the `` eastern europe '' part bugs me too . 
  what country is that ? 
  according to the articles i 've seen , it was ibm employees from both the czech republic and romania . 
  i 'm pretty sure the czechs will complain that they 're not eastern europeans , but central europeans . 
  yes , because hunyadi sounds too hungarian . 
  the corvins were a noble family from transylvania . 
  they had a mixed hungarian and romanian ancestry , so we both consider them `` ours '' . 
   this is their castle . 
  statistically , sharks are not a problem . 
  there are other more dangerous animals than sharks . 
  but it 's not lobbying directly between two companies ( which would be `` sales '' ) , but using the state as an intermediary to convince them to use the services of some company or another . 
   the only thing that will convince me to move away from diesels not the only thing . 
  what about an outright ban of diesels ? 
  in germany , france , spain and uk ( where the factories are located ) , it 's obvious that the local industry & labour unions lobby is stronger than the american lobby . 
  in the rest of the countries in western europe ( with the exception of scandianvia ) , the franco-german influence is stronger than the american influence . 
  eastern europe is generally more pro-american than pro-german . 
  actually , typically , airbus/boeing do the lobbying in their home countries ( germany/france or the us ) and it 's the governments of these countries who do their lobbying at the highest level . 
  the decision is mostly political . 
  eastern europe is more pro-american than pro-european , so they choose the american variant . 
   honestly they were probably germans their family name was `` kra\u010dek '' ( spelled `` kracsek '' by the hungarian authorities of transylvania ) , which sounds czech . 
  we have some czechs in romania , too : there are some czech villages which settled during the habsburg era in the banat region . 
  also , there were ethnic czechs who moved to transylvania during the austro-hungarian empire , but these were quickly assimilated by marrying romanians and hungarians . 
  some of my wife 's ancestors were ethnic czechs from the region near karlovy vary , who came to work as technicians in the mines in transylvania . 
   for the next 30 years they 're optimists . 
  only people from the pays de galles . 
  but you ruin the view from trump 's golf course !, 
  what about the north of ireland ? 
  well , much of the pollution was due to agriculture and human waste . 
  slovakia was part of czecho ** slovakia ** , so it 's next to the czechs . 
  water still wet . 
  it has been like this for decades : moldova asks russia to retreat , russia says no . 
  ireland : no earthquakes , no snakes , no heavy snowfall , no scorching heat . 
  and what happens if the nearest port is lampedusa ? 
  well , a bit more than a year : 1599-1600 .
