  in july 1996 , the u.s. secretary of defense declared , `` i can not overestimate the importance of ukraine as an independent country to the security and stability of all of europe , ''  [ ... ]  most important , however , is ukraine . 
  as the eu and nato expand , ukraine will eventually be in the position to choose whether it wishes to be part of either organization . 
  it is likely that , in order to reinforce its separate status , ukraine will wish to join both , once they border upon it and once its own internal transformation begins to qualify it for membership . 
  although that will take time , it is not too early for the west -- while further enhancing its economic and security ties with kiev -- to begin pointing to the decade ** 2005-2015 ** as a reasonable time frame for the ** initiation of ukraine 's progressive inclusion ** , thereby reducing the risk that the ukrainians may fear that europe 's expansion will halt on the polish-ukrainian border . 
    russia , despite its protestations , is likely to acquiesce in the expansion of nato in 1999 to include several central european countries , because the cultural and social gap between russia and central europe has widened so much since the fall of communism . 
  by contrast , russia will find it ** incomparably harder to acquiesce in ukraine 's accession to nato ** , for to do so would be to acknowledge that ukraine 's destiny is no longer organically linked to russia 's .

  that sounds like a joke that swedes tell . 
  there are so many of them because they have no predator . 
  no local hunters complaining about how the wolves are eating the roe deers ? 
  yes , i know about this . 
  but just because some europeans did nasty things to your ancestors does n't justify you doing nasty things to the palestinians . 
   without clearing all hurdles with local authorities the israelis almost never allow any construction works to be done by the palestinians in the occupied territories . 
   i do n't know a single country that would react kindly to an unlicensed foreign backed construction without permits in area under its jurisdiction . 
  do you know a single country where the majority of the population does n't have voting rights ? 
  it 's not even very leftist , it 's a liberal newspaper , similar to the new york times . 
   the amount of antisemitism in this thread is insane . 
  being against israel 's policies towards the palestinians is not equal to antisemitism . 
  i know it 's the official policy of israel to lump these together , but that 's wrong and i think most people here agree with this . 
  it 's obvious that due to the occupation the palestinians are not master of their own destiny . 
  there are only two obvious solutions : * you either give israeli citizenship and voting rights to all palestinians ( one-state solution ) * you give full independence to the palestinian territories ( two-state solution ) as long as neither of these is implemented , it 's an apartheid state . 
  of course , it was not never `` communist '' at all either . 
  some socialists argue that soviet-style socialism is not even socialism because the workers had very little to no control over the means of production , using `` state capitalism '' instead . 
   i thought this was standard in any european country . 
  the only place in the eu where i 've seen a warning in a hotel not to drink the tap water was in malta . 
  and the only place where i 've seen in a hotel a sign which encouraged me to drink the tap water was in denmark . 
  it reformed into a hybrid . 
  the state has huge influence everywhere in the economy . 
  china was communist , but it reformed gradually . 
   it was n't china that did that , it was massive western investment . 
  most investment in mainland china was never from the us or europe , but from asia , especially taiwan , hong kong , singapore , south korea , japan , etc. 
  for example , the largest private employer in china ( foxconn , 1.3 million employees ) is taiwanese . 
  i have a co-worker from \u00c5lesund who is wearing skinny jeans . 
  that 's not really outdated , that 's just wrong . 
   stop putinbotting . 
  yeah , because it 's not possible to have a different opinion without being a putin bot . 
  also , the huge cost to find and train workers and technicians who work on that factory . 
  yes . 
   they can give lots of benefits to women with more kids now , but they do n't . 
  they closed down many public kindergardens in the country and the private sector replaced them with expensive ones . 
  in the countryside , there are virtually no kindergardens at all . 
  they were all closed down after 1989 . 
  there is no tax incentive to have kids , we have a flat tax system . 
  ( at least now it 's a flat tax , until a year ago , we had a regressive tax system : the higher the wage , the lower the percentage due to a cap on social security contributions ) . 
   choose one . 
  you can argue that `` climate change '' is false , but there 's no one questioning that particulate matter is very bad for health . 
  the us and uk have a history of overthrowing democratic governments and replacing them with dictatorships . 
  english got some names of italian cities from the local dialects rather than from standard italian . 
  for instance , `` milan '' is the name of the city in milanese . 
   why would that person do that when he/she can earn more than that amount in romania ? 
  short story : no , they ca n't earn more than that in romania . 
  the minimum wage in romania is 230 $ ( after taxes ) . 
  but these jobs are often not in the areas where the unemployed people live . 
  they 'd have to move to bucharest or cluj or some other city where the jobs are . 
  in the cities the costs are high and they need to rent an apartment . 
  it 's hard to afford that out of that minimum wage . 
  the legislation is generally a very bad deal for workers , a great deal for business owners . 
  for instance , the minimum wage is 7 $ / month . 
  based on the regressive measures they 've implemented , i expect them to consider restoring feudalism as well . 
  why off ? 
  are the `` poor '' too many ? 
  i 'd argue not . 
  first of all , all the subsistence farmers are poor ( poorer than the minimum wage employees ) , no question about it . 
  then , the ( mostly urban ) minimum wage employees are poor , barely making enough to pay rent or mortgage . 
  this is half of the employees . 
  but also people who make above the minimum wage are poor , especially those living in high-cost cities like bucharest or cluj . 
  you have to take into consideration that in romania , a 500 $ / month gross wage would make you among the top 10 % . 
   the psd seem to be to be a horribly inept and corrupt party correct . 
  the problem is that we do n't have an alternative . 
  the main two opposition parties : * liberals are slightly less corrupt ( that does n't mean they 're not also horribly corrupt , but they 're more inept in organizing it ) , but they make up by being even more inept in general . 
  * save romania union is a protest party against corruption . 
  however , they do n't have a ideology , having members varying from hard-left socialists to us-style libertarians , from religious conservatives to progressists . 
  as expected , they spend most of the time in-fighting . 
  they spent the last month arguing internally ( with a lot of drama ) over gay marriage . 
   macron in france proved something its that maybe it 'd be possible to capture the reformist energy that 's not possible in romania because we do n't have a big middle class . 
  romania basically has : * 0.1 % very very rich . 
  * 10 % european-level middle class ( almost all of it in bucharest and a few more cities like cluj and timi\u0219oara ) * 90 % poor the poor are not going to vote for economic liberalism anymore . 
  they know that more austerity is going to lower their standard of living . 
  the opposition had virtually all the press against them . 
   all other following actions , such as genocides and ethnic cleansing , are equally only the chosen preferred method of some of them to achieve that the extermination of `` inferior '' races and taking up their lands ( `` lebensraum '' ) are a central part of nazism . 
   marx was very clear about the essence of what the `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' would be and it fully entitled violence , on a huge scale , against the `` enemy social classes '' . 
  marxism is absolutely inherently violent and genocidal by definition . 
  really ? 
  if you are such an expert in marxism , i 'm sure you can give me a quotation of marx in which he says you need to exterminate/do genocide on the `` enemy social classes '' . 
  try to convince meps to outlaw some of the parties that are part of the european parliament ? 
  very democratic , indeed . 
  of course far-left is the same as the far right . 
  the far left wants more economic and social equality , the far right wants to exterminate a part of the people . 
  same thing . 
  i thought sweden must be destroyed and norway must be conquered . 
  actually , his slogan is that he 's strong and not entirely stable ... 
   switzerland wanted its own atomic bomb so did ceau\u0219escu 's romania . 
   a hatred for communists is n't the communist party the 3rd largest party in the czech parliament , after the social-democrats and the liberals of ano 2011 ? 
  of course , it 's a joke on the masked racism of the conservatives . 
  i 'd rather vote for mr. bean than for darth vader . 
  at least mr. bean has good intentions . 
  do n't give trump any ideas . 
  warsaw was at the time the third largest city in russia .
