  i do n't know , here in the balkans , men used to wear skirts ( [ here 's the romanian one ] ( http://www.festivaluri-romanesti.ro/media/festival/173/1560/gc06najq_alaiul-calusului-oltenesc-duminica-rusaliilor-31-mai-2015-editia-a-xviii-a_2.jpg ) ) , and those seem more comfortable than the blue jeans i 'm wearing now . 
  hopefully , this is a good thing and it will lead to the creation of a european defense pact . 
  the eu spends a lot of money on defense ( 194 billion $ as of 2014 ) , far more than the biggest potential enemy ( russia , $ 65 million as of 2015 ) , so we do n't need american protection . 
  we can handle it ourselves , all we need is to collaborate more . 
  the slavs ( south slavs , so basically bulgarians ) north of danube became romanians . 
  the romanians south of danube became bulgarians . 
   competition is bad apparently competition works when it can be a real competition , not in highly-subsidized natural monopolies . 
  for instance , a decade ago we bought a 20 years old overpriced frigate from britain . 
  it was too old and outdated for the british navy , so paid a huge sum to buy it . 
  there was a corruption probe involving tony blair , but it died out . 
  probably because it also involved tony blair , not just our politicians . 
  ukraine is game to you ?!, 
  how ` bout i take your little board and smash it ? 
  romania was a partner of both palestine and israel . 
  we were among the first countries to recognize the independence of both israel ( in 1948 ) and palestine ( in 1988 ) . 
  or like the old principality of moldova being divided into separate states and the romanian government complaining about the moldova name because a romanian region bears the same name ? 
  you mean the way they do with most `` organic '' products ? 
  we voted by staying at home . 
  during the last elections ( 2008 ) , in bucharest , the turnout was around 30 % , with one district having as low as 22 % . 
  it 's going to be even lower this year . 
  the problem is that if we protest , we do n't have an alternative organization we trust that could take the power . 
  austria , germany , the netherlands and uk certainly voiced their opposition at some point . 
  german companies got , among other things , some pretty good contracts for romania 's border surveillance technology ( worth several billion $ ) . 
  the uk ( actually , tony blair ) intervened in favor of lakshmi mittal , to help him buy some steel plants in romania . 
  in case you 're wondering what has labour to do with mr. mittal , it 's money , party donations :  [ lakshmi mittal made news for donating money to new labour and then buying up the romanian steel industry with the help of a letter from tony blair . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2002/may/05/madeleinebunting.theobserver ), 
  well , it takes two to tango . 
  also , corporations are as corrupt `` there '' as they are `` here '' . 
  @adamkex : btw , the latest corruption scandal in romania involves ericsson . 
  we bribed you . 
  seriously , our government bribed each country which opposed our entry in the eu . 
  some countries ( well , private companies in those countries ) got construction or service contracts , others got to buy romanian state companies for a tenth of their real value . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence that the country which was the strongest opposer of romania 's entry in the eu was austria ( it was the j\u00f6rg haider era ) and after austrian companies bought our biggest state assets : omv bought the petroleum company ( petrom ) and erste bought our biggest bank ( bcr ) , the austrian state started being our greatest supporter . 
  ah , it seems that partidul alian\u021ba socialist\u0103 is different from partidul socialist which is the one enamored with the juche idea . 
  that party is a just a bunch of senile old-time communists who say that things were better during ceau\u0219escu and spend their time writing letters to north korean workers ' party . 
  how can one take them seriously ? 
  btw , [ some north korean stuff ] ( https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=site:kcna.co.jp+romania ) . 
   anyway , this kind of measures mentioned by op looks like a trust trying to stop others from entering the political `` market '' . 
  you have to complement their audacity , it seems they 're not even trying to hide it . 
  our former prime minister mihai r\u0103zvan ungureanu ( pdl ) said that [ `` the crisis exists just for the people who do n't want to work '' ] ( http://www.rtv.net/mru-din-nou-despre-lenesi-criza-este-doar-pentru-cei-care-nu-doresc-sa-munceasca_29895.html ) . 
   you could also argue that to contest a nation wide election in the uk , the least you will be able to spend is # 325,000 ( # 500 for each constituency ) . 
   your point still stands though . 
  the equivalent for the uk would be : 2355 x # 1000 ( minimum wage ) x 3 times the population = # 7,065,000, 
   populist is the best way to describe them . 
  nationalist themes have n't featured that much in their message . 
  i 'd argue it follows ceau\u0219escu 's ideology : some nationalism , some socialism , some populism and a lot of idiocy . 
  but yeah , it 's definitely not the `` we hate the hungarians '' kind of violent nationalism . 
  well , the result is that small parties ca n't afford it . 
  last elections cycle , the green party did n't afford it . 
  same with the pirate party this elections cycle . 
  their policies include : * doing whatever imf asks them * which includes privatizations of the [ post offices ] ( http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-telecom-13246557-victor-ponta-posta-belgiana-manifestat-mod-special-interesul-veni-participare-20-posta-romana.htm ) , [ railroads ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/economic/privatizarea-cfr-marfa-companii-din-polonia-si-cehia-si-au-exprimat-intentia-de-a-prelua-compania-10116942 ) , [ copper , oil , gas , hydro plants , nuclear plants ] ( http://ziuadecj.realitatea.net/economie/georgescufondurile-din-privatizare-vor-fi-investite-in-companii-strategice-din-energie-si-transport--101365.html ) , etc. 
  * continuation of the austerity measures started by the previous government * [ privatization of the healthcare system ] ( http://www.capital.ro/detalii-articole/stiri/168546.html ) : allowing private insurers to get money from taxes -- the state is going to be just one of the many insurers , all of them funded for a start by the state budget ; the universal state-sponsored healthcare system is going to give just a `` basic package '' of services , you have to pay extra for many `` non-emergency '' procedures ; state hospitals will become autonomous entities which can become bankrupt and be bought by foreign companies , etc. 
  * doing absolutely nothing to prevent the poverty in some part of the population ( that is comparable with africa and ca n't be found anywhere else in europe ) they could at least increase that minimum wage ( 170 $ before taxes ) , which is absolutely a disgrace . 
  with such a wage ( which more than a third of all workers get ) it 's impossible to live a comfortable life , hence the widespread poverty . 
  the pdl are worse than psd because they complain about how lazy are romanians . 
  those people who work from morning till evening for a pittance ... 
  it would have worked better if they have had no war , like in czechoslovakia . 
  the pro-independence right-wing party of mas ( ciu ) lost some seats , but another pro-independence left-party the esquerra republicana de catalunya ( republican left ) won them . 
  now it remains to see whether they get along better with right-wing parties that are against independence or with left-wing parties that are pro-independence . 
  i do not trust the eu institutions on which the people do n't have direct control . 
  the european parliament , being directly voted in by the people is much better than the institutions ( such as the european commission ) where the members are appointed or negotiated by politicians . 
  ... and the wind ( if you 're on the coast ) , and the darkness ... 
  it depends on the region , turkey is a rather diverse country . 
  in some kurdish regions , 40 % of the marriages are between cousins . 
  that 's not the case in istanbul or the other westernized regions . 
  purple : redneckism ? 
  germany is not competitive due to low wages , but rather due to high productivity due to widespread use of automation and economy of scale . 
  yes , it 's when a particle is not ionized . 
  palestine would never give up willingly gaza or any territory . 
  same for the jews in west bank . 
   vote . 
  always . 
  everywhere . 
  in every opportunity . 
  we have two big parties : one which is supporting the local oligarchy , one which is supporting the big corporations . 
  the others are mostly fringe nationalists . 
  great choice !, 
  despite the image you may have about romania , violent crime is lower in bucharest than in most big cities in europe . 
  quality of life is , like elsewhere , dependent on the amount of money you have . 
  the incomes of those scientists are going to be high enough to give them a comfortable life here and the prices are lower than in western europe , let alone switzerland . 
   my romanian friend disagrees with the idea that romania is a nice country . 
  there are two vocal kinds of romanians : those who think that romanians are the best , smartest , etc. 
  people in the world and those who think that romanians are the scum of the world and that there 's no worse country in the world . 
  both are wrong . 
  yes , they are , but most romanians do n't consider them `` real romanians '' . 
  we complain about anti-romanian xenophobia , but anti-gypsy racism here is way worse than that . 
  aviation requires a lot of expensive infrastructure as well . 
  building an airport is not cheap . 
  for instance , the new terminal at london heathrow costs around $ 2 billion . 
  the operation was successful , but the patient is dead . 
  yes , but the civil code can be changed far easier than the constitution , requiring just a plain parliamentary majority . 
  in romania and moldova , a constitutional change requires a referendum in which not only  50 % to vote for it , but also  50 % turnout . 
  in bulgaria , it requires at least 75 % of the mps to vote for . 
  tl ; dr : in romania , if 50 % + 1 of the people ( or rather , people 's representatives ) want gay marriage , it 'll happen . 
  in moldova and bulgaria , you 'd need at least 75 % + 1 , which makes it far more likely it wo n't happen in the near future . 
  some details : * the `` debate about homosexuality '' actually was a theatre play about `` the history of homosexuality in romania '' organized by political science students and mili\u021bia spiritual\u0103 ( a progressive politics organization ) . 
  * the main opponents to homosexuality are the neonazis : [ noua dreapt\u0103 ] ( http://www.nouadreapta.org/ ) organization organizes an annual anti-homosexuality march ; the church , while opposing homosexuality has toned down its attacks in the last few years and it no longer gives any support for the neonazi activities . 
  * young people and intellectuals are more tolerant of homosexuals than the less-educated and older people and the attitudes are slowly changing toward acceptance throughout the whole society . 
  * politicians avoid this subject like plague : they do n't want to lose the votes of either those supporting homosexuals ' rights , nor the homophobic votes * unlike many other eastern european countries , our constitution does n't define marriage as being between a man and a woman ( like in poland , serbia , bulgaria , ukraine , moldova , etc ) , so that should make gay marriage easier to implement , but there 's still little support for gay marriages among the people or the politicians , so it might take some years . 
   why is anti-semitism so widespread in the balkans ?
