  in romanian , we have things like `` fuck your mother gods ! '', 
  ( futu-\u021bi dumnezeii m\u0103-tii ) , also swearings about other religious things like christ or easter . 
  people of catalunya pay taxes directly to spain 's central institutions . 
  the spaniards then give back the local authorities a part of the taxes and they also give state services , while keeping the rest for use in the other poorer regions of spain . 
  the difference between what they pay and what they get back is 18 billion $ each a year , a huge sum for a relatively small region like catalunya . 
  the cypriot banks got money from rich tax-dodging greeks ( who wanted to keep their money hidden from their government ) and borrowed it to the greek government . 
  now the banks are in a difficult situation because the greek government will probably not pay back the money to those banks . 
  in other words , the cypriot government does n't want to sell their country 's assets for scraps and bring widespread poverty just to bail out the rich greeks . 
   every country with universal healthcare , unemployment insurance , social security , pensions , regulations for workplace safety theoretically , romania is a social democracy . 
  it says so in the constitution , but i would n't consider romania a social democracy in practice . 
  we do n't have universal healthcare . 
  first of all , it 's not universal : you 're not covered just by being a citizen living here , which means that plenty of people are left uninsured . 
  ( most of the uninsured are the poor working without any papers and gypsies , so many romanians think it 's fair ) then , many mds in state hospitals ( and virtually everyone working there ) require informal bribes/payments before treating you , even though that 's illegal . 
  theoretically , we have social security : practically , if you 're poor and without any income , the state gives you 125 ron ( 27 euro ) a month . 
  that 's not enough to feed yourself , let alone get you a place to live , hence the large numbers of homeless people in bucharest . 
  the only place where i 've seen so many homeless was in the us . 
  yes , but they did n't have actual empires , there was no centralized power : they were mostly bands of roaming nomads , each band having its own khan . 
  if we are to include all the migrating people and warriors who came around this region , the list would be at lest 3-4 times as big . 
  [ xerxes did n't stop after he conquered the spartans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_achaemenid_empire_en.png ), 
  i do n't think there 's any norwegian named ole participating . 
  persian , roman , byzantine , hunnic , mongol , hungarian , bulgarian , ottoman , polish -- lithuanian , russian , austrian , soviet . 
  then why is the term [ antiziganismus ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiziganismus ) used ? 
  also , i 've seen people concerned about how french football clubs will be affected by this tax , because they will not be able to attract foreign stars which are paid many millions . 
   of course automation is partly to blame , but also corporate tax is to blame too . 
  the mean corporate taxes are higher in the us than in france or most of the eu . 
  what 's higher in the eu are consumption taxes/sales tax/vat and in some countries , personal income tax . 
  actually , the main purpose of the 75 % tax on personal income is to encourages rich folks not to take that many dividends out of their companies , leading for more money available for investment and hence , in theory , more jobs . 
  joblessness is rising across the globe , it has little to do with the policies one country or another takes . 
  for instance , the us has now [ fewer jobs ] ( http://maysreport.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/non-farm-payrolls-jan-1975-jan-2012.jpg ) than it had in 2000 , despite a large increase in population ( 33 million more people ) and a huge increase in production/gdp/corporate profits since . 
  the us government has constantly had for the last 20 years a very `` pro-business '' attitude and everyone promised `` job creation '' and yet , there are no new jobs . 
  if you want to see the real reason for joblessness , you have to look at another article posted on / r/europe : [ french vineyards look to robots as new source of manual labor ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/26/3413784/wall-ye-france-wine-robot ), 
   well , somebody needs to pay for research of new medicine . 
  actually , much of medical research is paid through grants by governments and charities . 
  annually , more than $ 100 billion are fed into medical research by governments and charities . 
  the us government alone pays $ 26 billion for medical research , with the other developed countries paying similar , if not higher , proportions of their gdp and cancer research charities rasing probably even more . 
  ( for instance , just a uk charity , `` cancer research uk '' raises half a billion pounds each year ) the pharmaceutical companies get those grants to do the research , but they keep the drug patents if they find something . 
   all cancers mortality rates , 2009  * finland ... 165 per 100000 population  * spain ... 211 per 100000 population  * estonia ... 275 per 10000 population also , the statistics are even more grim than they look if we take in consideration the average age in each country . 
  easter european countries are generally younger than western countries , so they get less cancer . 
  ( age is by far the best predictor of cancer ), 
   now mortality rates more or less correlate with gdp per capita , the higher it is , the lower the mortality rate is for some types of cancer , the pharmaceutical companies will sell you a treatment for 70000 euro . 
  for the patients , there are two choices : you take the treatment , you have 80 % chances of recovery , you do n't take it , you die within a year , virtually no exceptions . 
  of course the sum paid has nothing to do with their costs , which are ( excluding research ) probably less than 100 euro , but with the maximum amount that western european governments and american insurance companies are willing to pay to save one life . 
  the poorer countries ( including eastern european countries ) ca n't afford to pay this sum and they 're not allowed by the western countries to make their own version of the drugs , due to patent law . 
  so people die needlessly : not because we ca n't create the drugs they need , but because the artificial scarcity must be enforced in order to make the biggest profits for those companies . 
  and it would encourage people to pay their taxes . 
  oh , the horror !, 
  [ raymond aron ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raymond_aron ) , another french philosopher, 
  yes , but the latinization of the language mostly failed . 
  many basic words : love [ dragoste ] , friend [ prieten ] , to read [ citi ] , to hit [ lovi ] , sick [ bolnav ] , relative [ rud\u0103 ] etc. 
  are still of slavic origin . 
  the latin equivalents they wanted to replace them have either disappeared ( no one ever says `` morboas\u0103 '' instead of `` bolnav\u0103 '' ) or seem pretentious ( `` amor '' instead of `` dragoste '' ) . 
  in a few cases , they have entered the mainstream language as synonyms of the slavic words ( like trup/corp = body , glas/voce = voice ) . 
   it will actively hurt the illegal settlement and colonisation of the occupied palestinian territories most people do n't care about where the products are made . 
  a few might actively boycott them and a few might actively search and buy those products to support the israelis because they 're `` fighting the muslims '' . 
  imo , it wo n't change anything . 
  same for the french . 
  they decapitated their kings for a reason . 
  do n't you ask yourself why `` socialism '' ( actually social-democracy ) worked for the previous generation , but not for the current one ? 
  we have a much higher work efficiency now , so this should n't be a issue . 
  actually , if you take out the defense spending ( which was used for buying expensive german military equipment ) , greece would have had almost the entire time a budget surplus .

  note that the source is russia today , so a grain of salt is required . 
  i 'm not saying that the whole turkey is european , just that some parts are european . 
  i know that the eastern turkey was not very different from what syria used to be before the war and that the because of their `` kurdish problem '' , it has been a war zone for decades . 
  i 'm not even a turkey enlargement fan . 
  i think that the turkey should be allowed in only after all the other balkan countries are integrated . 
  your country is already in the eu , so no point in convincing us that we need enlargement . 
   i might get down voted for this , but i really do n't get why turkey is seen as a european country . 
  because istanbul is , culturally , historically and geographically , european . 
   i 'm sorry , so are you arguing that we should raise taxes oink oink oink ? 
  no , i 'm not arguing that . 
  taxing the workers would be counterproductive , since they already pay high taxes . 
  i 'm arguing that you should remove all the loopholes that allow companies and their owners to pay little tax . 
  that 's cherry picking some taxes that are indeed higher , while ignoring other taxes such as property taxes or widespread use of loopholes in business . 
  the only measure that really matters ( because it shows a good overview , regardless of the actual details in each country ) is `` taxes as percentage of gdp '' - here 's data for 2010 from [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_structures/2012/annex_a.xls ) : * denmark : 47.6 % * sweden : 45.8 % * norway : 42.9 % compare to the pigs : * spain : 31.9 % * portugal : 31.5 % * greece : 31.0 % * ireland : 28.2 %, 
  what you tried was n't the nordic model . 
  the nordic model does n't mean you borrow a lot of money and use it on welfare payments , like southern europe did it . 
  that 's not something that can work in the long term . 
  you need to have high taxes and use that money to redistribute the incomes . 
  southern european governments wanted everyone to win in the short term : * the rich - by having low taxes * the poor - by having good welfare * the politicians - through shady `` investment '' contracts with kickbacks ... and everything paid from loans by the next government . 
  the nordic model is best for the common folk . 
  the anglo-saxon model is best for the financial elite . 
  the southern model is best for the political elite . 
   its important that there is any investment and therefore work and therefore income . 
  and who will invest in the balkans ? 
  for the last three years , the investors have been afraid to do that because they fear contagion from the greeks . 
  in 2011 , there has been less than 2 billion euro of foreign direct investment . 
  make it more attractive to investors ? 
  how ? 
  together with the bulgarians , we have the eu 's lowest wages , very low taxes ( flat tax -10 / 16 % ) , very little to no social security and our state gives a lot of subsidies to investors . 
  for romania , i do n't think it 's possible , not within the next 50-60 years . 
  maybe for a small country , there could be some special case . 
  here 's the reason ( an example for romania ) : * the resources ( e.g. 
  oil : austrian omv , minerals , metal ores ) are owned by westerners * a lot of the land is owned by westerners ( i read that in some counties of the west of the country , over half of the arable land is owned by italians , laundering mafia money ) * much of the infrastructure ( water distribution : veolia , electricity distribution : enel italy , gas distribution : gaz de france , etc ) is owned by westerners . 
  * all supermarket chains ( without any exception ) are western-owned : mega image ( delhaize belgium ) , kaufland ( germany ) , carrefour ( france ) , lidl ( germany ) , etc. 
  * out of the top 100 romanian companies , 98 are owned by foreigners . 
  how are we going to get developed when the profit money from all this is not invested back in the country ? 
  much of it is taken to the country of the owners . 
  you could say that we should build our own companies , but from what money ? 
  to compete with the cheap german imports you need a lot of capital .
