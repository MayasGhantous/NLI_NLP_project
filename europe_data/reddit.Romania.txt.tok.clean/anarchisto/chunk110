  a third of the romanian employees get the minimum wage of 160 $ / month . 
  the median is 300 $ / month . 
  that 's barely enough to get by from one wage to the next . 
  from a cultural point of view , i feel closer to romania , eastern europe and southern europe . 
  it feels more like `` home '' in italy or greece than i feel in austria , but that does n't mean i do n't want the eu to be a closer federation . 
  also , i know quite a few people ( mostly from western europe ) who are very pro-european , but anti-eu because they feel that the eu is undemocratically imposing people an economic model ( their version of capitalism ) , from which there can be no exceptions . 
  megleno-romanian is only found in greece and turkey , istro-romanian just in croatia . 
  aromanian did reach the old yugoslavia , but i do n't think there are many in serbia . 
  probably a dialect of archaic / `` pure '' romanian , the way we spoke it a few centuries ago , without the influences from italian and french . 
  usually , at least in romania , the western politicians expected to be `` bribed '' in order to have a positive view . 
  for instance , we got our way inside the eu with the help of `` privatization bribes '' , buying companies often for less 10 % of the real value : * austria got our biggest bank and our oil company * italy got parts of our electricity network * france got our water in some cities ( including bucharest ) * greece got our phone company * uk got our steel plants ( actually , lakshmi mittal is indian , but ask tony blair why he asked our government to sell it to him ) etc. 
  in some cases we simply bought something for a huge price , more than the market price . 
  for instance , from uk we bought some frigates so old they initially wanted to sell for scrap . 
  now germany ( actually , deutsche bahn ) wants to buy our railroad , so they 're trying to get involved in our internal politics for that . 
  you do n't need a survey to notice that : * bosnians drink copious amounts of locally-made rakija * albanian girls ' skirts are the shortest in europe * bulgarian turks love pork . 
  `` actually gypsies and the rroma people are two different people . '', 
  -- his whole post is based on the nonsense that gypsies and roma are different : they 're just two names for the same people . 
  `` gypsy '' is an offensive word , roma is a more `` politically correct '' word . 
  what he 's claiming would be like saying that `` negroes '' and `` african americans '' are two different ethnicities and bringing pictures to show examples of [ negroes ] ( http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/soc217_pimentel/family.jpg ) and of [ african americans ] ( http://blog.mkf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/black-students-on-steps11.jpg ), 
  i ca n't believe how much bullshit you were able to fit in one post . 
  it 's not doing ok . their economy is stagnating partly because almost every company is owned by foreigners ( especially austrians and germans ) , who now , because of the crisis , wo n't invest anything in the `` risky '' eastern europe . 
  because of this , they voted in the nationalists -- but who ca n't do anything with the economy because the eu wo n't allow them . 
   poland gdp per capita grow from being 1/6th of germany in 1991 to 1/3rd of germany in 2010 the gdp per capita is n't a very good indicator , especially in countries where most of the capital is foreign-owned . 
  we should look instead at the average gross wage : in poland it 's less than 1/4 of the one in germany . 
  in hungary , it 's 1/5 . 
  in romania it 's 1/7 . 
  in bulgaria , it 's 1/9 . 
   you can not fix 50 years of backwardness quickly . 
  if the eu wo n't transform itself into a federation , i ca n't see how the eastern european countries will ever be as rich as the west . 
  [ just look at the map of europe 's purchasing power after more than two decades of capitalism ] ( http://www.gfk-geomarketing.com/fileadmin/gfkgeomarketing/en/img/press/purchasing_power_europe_2008_2009.gif ) i do n't see how this can change in another 20 or 30 years , if things stay as they are . 
  i 'm not arguing that it does not produce things , just that the importance of industry is lower than in other western countries . 
  labour force by occupation : * uk : agriculture 1.4 % ; industry 8 % ; services : 90.6 % * france : agriculture 3.8 % , industry 24.3 % , services 71.8 % * germany : agriculture 2.4 % , industry 29.7 % , services 67,8 %, 
  bauxite ( aluminium ore ) is cheap and there are plenty of places where it 's extracted worldwide . 
  aluminium is relatively expensive because in order to turn bauxite into pure aluminium you need a lot of electricity . 
  when you have electricity that you ca n't export , it 's the easiest way to use it : for instance , iceland uses geothermal electricity for it . 
  but in the case of scotland , they can even export it to england , which has an ever-increasing demand of electricity . 
   you still have the issue that exports would become less attractive to outsiders as the euro strengthens . 
  it depends on what kind of exports you have . 
  if you have high-tech exports , they 're not affected much by a strong currency . 
  for instance , sweden , despite its very strong currency , had no problem in getting a healthy trade surplus . 
   you realise joining the euro will make everything a lot more expensive that 's nonsense . 
  prices are not set by the currency in which they 're set . 
  if you travel around the eurozone , you 'll notice huge differences between prices : slovakia and greece are cheap , while france , germany and finland are more expensive and even within one country , there are differences : if i go to southern italy , you can buy a pizza for 5 $ , while in some parts of the north of the country , the same could reach at least three times as much . 
   renewable energy ... which is not something easily transportable , and you can not eat kilowatthours . 
  yes , you can transport it : it 's called aluminium smelting . 
   if it does not produce much , it will become a country having a permanent negative trade surplus that 's valid for the whole uk , which disregarded production as being part of an antiquated economy and encouraged finance . 
  since westminster made a focus on finance , it has been pretty hard for scotland to steer away from it : nevertheless , both edinburgh and glasgow are among world 's [ top 50 financial hubs ] ( http://www.longfinance.net/publications/gfci%2011.pdf ) . 
  we need a fresh start : a new city built on the border of two countries in central europe . 
  my proposal is somewhere on the border between germany and czech republic . 
  my first thought was prague as well , but then i realized how it will ruin one of the best cities in europe . 
  scotland will be a small country , 5 million people . 
  it does n't need to produce everything . 
  a few niche [ high-tech businesses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silicon_glen ) , some resource extraction , some traditional products ( like scotch ) , some well-promoted tourism is all they need for a flourishing economy . 
  quality : sicilian food  central italy food  northern italy food price : sicilian food < central italy food < northern italy food so basically , sicilians have cheap good food and padania has expensive crappy food . 
  [ bucharest  rest of the country ] ( http://www.masuramedia.ro/files.php?file=grafic-1_111692023.jpg ) * bucharest : gdp/capita : 14,289 $ * boto\u0219ani ( northern moldavia ) : gdp/capita : 2,804 $, 
  yes , but increasing the hdi was not done by borrowing more money . 
  the money increased the gdp , while keeping the percentage of debt pretty much the same . 
  if you look at [ this graph ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:el&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=greece+government+debt ) , you 'll see that the debt in 2000 ( 103 % ) , before joining the euro , was not very different from the debt right before the crisis , in 2007 ( 107 % ) . 
   so because greek politicians , elected by the majority of greek voters , engage in shady deals with foreign companies that is somehow our german problem ? 
  so the wrongdoings of german companies ( siemens , daimler , deutsche bahn , deutsche telekom , ferrostaal , howaldtswerke-deutsche werft , etc ) abroad are not a german problem ? 
  do morals stop at the german border ? 
   greece is paying the bill for living well beyond its means for decades the western press keeps saying that to justify what 's happening now , but it 's not true . 
  the greeks always had a standard of living far below what 's the norm in western europe . 
  the money did n't go to the people , but rather to their corrupt political elite and to western companies ( [ siemens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens_greek_bribery_scandal ) , [ daimler , deutsche bahn and the german defense industry ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/complicit-in-corruption-how-german-companies-bribed-their-way-to-greek-deals-a-693973.html ) were involved in public scandals , but there were many more companies which did the same ) , who paid the kickbacks to this elite . 
  it 's what is called in international law [ odious debt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odious_debt ) . 
  it 's worse in greece : the gdp continues to fall as germany and the rest of eu lenders ask the government to make more and more cuts, 
   in that case does n't mean they care about religion ? 
  no , just that they are more likely to accept you as you are . 
  same for homosexuality . 
   in a country where the vast majority of people are religious do n't people assume you 're religious by default ? 
  well , christianity is more like part of the `` heritage '' , like ethnicity . 
  you inherit the religion , but that does n't mean you actually ever read the bible . 
   is there any stigma associated with atheism ? 
  yes , but less so among the younger people . 
  older people associate atheism with communism . 
   simply answering sincerely when asked , would people perceive someone like this in in a more negative light ? 
  actually , i feel there 's more stigma to ask in the first place than to admit it . 
  it depends on how you define `` religious '' . 
  in the big cities in romania , almost no one goes weekly ( or even monthly ) to church . 
  people still get baptized , they get married in church , get a christian burial service and some people even go to church on easter , but the habit of going to church each sunday morning disappeared with the urbanization . 
  so most people in the cities simply do n't care about religion , one way or another : they 're not going to church or listen to what priests say , but they do n't declare themselves as atheists either . 
  many think themselves as `` christians '' , even though they have some doubts over the existence of god . 
  for them , it 's easier to simply avoid this topic . 
   here in denmark the state can forcefully expropriate your lands on the grounds of `` common good '' . 
  that 's not possible in the us . 
  yes , it is possible for the state to expropriate your lands in the us as well : it 's called `` eminent domain '' . 
  if there were no such law , it will be not possible to build motorways or railroads . 
   easterneuropean : -1,200 comment karma do not feed the troll !, 
  before 1989 , there was an outbreak of aids in orphanages due to reusable needles . 
  it was kept secret and they did n't actually try much to solve the issue . 
  anyway , that was no longer a problem after they banned reusable needles in the 1990s . 
  romania has far lower aids rates than europe or america , so i do n't see the point of the article and most of what the article says can be said about any country . 
  the aids rates in spain and the us has more to do with their high drug usage . 
  no , that has to do with the fact that in a few months ( after the elections ) , the government will announce that chevron or some other american company will start drilling for shale gas , despite widespread opposition in romania . 
  clark is [ `` a board director of bnk petroleum , a shale gas developer and producer '' ] ( http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/gen.-wesley-clark-joins-solopower-call-for-government-support-of-solar/ ) . 
  i agree , but in the meantime , the funds given to the police , the army and the secret services increased . 
   massive bribes requested by the government . 
  let me tell you my little story of bribe requests . 
  i worked for a big international corporation ( bic ) doing some software for a big romanian government agency ( brga ) . 
  because the project was partly funded from world bank 's funds , the brga had to choose bic to make the software , not brga director 's cousin 's company , as it is customary in romanian government 's projects .
