  however , as the project was getting close to the end , brga kept finding things that were not ok : they always wanted things differently from the way they were , they wanted the user interface more `` friendly '' without telling how it should be and so on . 
  after two years of this ( with the bic 's project starting to run into negative numbers -- do n't worry , they make it up with the hardware part -- asking $ 2000 for a $ 200 cpu ) , the directors of the bic and brga find the solution : pic will pay $ 300,000 for a small and crappy web app ( part of the project ) to be made by two programmers in a month at a company that belongs to a friend of brga 's director . 
  the project is finally approved by brga . 
  another corruption happy end . 
  it 's as percentage of gdp , so it does n't matter . 
  but just for fun to calculate them : the gdp per capita ( power purchasing parity ) of romania is 1/3 of germany and the spending per capita is 1/2 ( 14 % vs. 28 % ) , so the amount of the benefits romanians get are 1/6 ( as ppp ) or 1/10 ( nominal values ) . 
  and we have the [ next-to-last social protection spending as percentage of gdp in the eu ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/2/2e/total_expenditure_on_social_protection_as_%25gdp_in_2008.png ) . 
  ( that 's in 2008 , before the cuts ) . 
   the pdl governments took some very harsh , but way overdue measures that were unpopular with most people yes , that 's correct . 
  the teachers had been long spoiled with their 200-300 euro/month salaries . 
  they surely deserved the 25 % cut a couple of years ago and since then , the salary freeze . 
  the luxurious romanian hospitals get way too much money : the smallest amount of the gdp of any european country - there are even african countries spending more for healthcare . 
  the politicians ( including traian b\u0103sescu ) , of course , go to austria for any medical issue , even for childbirth or minor surgery . 
  yes , those cuts were long overdue . 
  the `` middle-class '' ( which is just the the top 1 % -10 % ) of romanians still support him because of his libertarian rhethoric : lower taxes , fewer or no services from the state . 
  people in this `` middle-class '' can provide for themselves , anyway , while the rest are considered `` lazy people '' . 
  that middle class gets a confortable-enough life and they do n't want to share the `` wealth '' with the bottom 90 % . 
  i 'm pretty sure that virtually every romanian redditor belongs to this class , so i 'll burn a bit of karma . 
   but anyway , the problem is that psd does n't support the `` working class '' ( the bottom 90 % , those people who barely get by with 200-300 euro/month ) , either . 
  the psd wants to privatize the healthcare system as well : they just published a healthcare privatization law project , while the press is looking other ways . 
  well , at the very least , it will lower the price of housing in france . 
  well , b\u0103sescu lost the elections if we consider only the votes within the territory of romania , but he won by a small margin due to the votes from abroad . 
  there have been rumours of fraud because there were some large number of votes at some embassies and unlike the voting precincts in the country , those in the embassies had no independent or party observers . 
  in any case , it would n't finance those states . 
  it would finance banks from those states . 
  the ppd guys from romania ( elena b\u0103sescu , cristian preda and most of the pdl ) abstained . 
  they were afraid of the reaction of the local press if they voted for it . 
  the press close to b\u0103sescu claims that the impeachment referendum is an `` attack against democracy '' ( in their view , referendums tend to be a very undemocratic way of handling misbehaving and unpopular politicians ) and they had this morning on their front web page a [ picture of the social-liberal union president of the senate with a hitler moustache ] ( http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/52/evz.png/ ) . 
  the same newspaper has on the first-page an editorial saying that it 's a `` coup d'\u00e9tat of the mafia '' . 
  a very modern kind of coup d'\u00e9tat , using a referendum !, 
  / me gets some popcorn and reads the romanian press of all colours, 
  that many people were scum with their employees ? 
  my grandfather came to bucharest as an apprentice in the 1940s . 
  he told me stories about how nasty his employer was . 
  that there was a lot of corruption ? 
  in romania , there were as many corruption scandals as there are now . 
  bribes , kickbacks , embezzlement , the whole array of methods . 
  really , things have n't changed that much . 
  the communist era did n't bring the bad things in us , they had been there since the ottoman era , it simply did n't allow us to evolve . 
  that 's just my experience and the general climate within each society seems to agree with them . 
  i feel that the `` middle-upper '' class of romania is especially toxic . 
  i see how often they complain about the `` lower '' classes and they feel that the lower classes get way too many benefits . 
  the luxurious benefits they get is the minimum wage ( 160 euro/month ) and , if they 're unemployed , benefits worth 28 euro/month . 
  until late 1930s , romania had never been a dictatorship , it had a flawed democracy , but a democracy nevertheless and things were the same as they are now . 
  well , scandinavians have the fewest slackers in the world ( measured through the [ employment rate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_employment_rate ) ), 
  actually , the lack of laziness is a result of their culture , not something that is inborn . 
  i am a romanian working for a norwegian company ( with co-workers from across scandinavia ) and i think these are the differences between typical balkanian/eastern european thinking and scandinavian thinking : * ** fairness ** : scandinavians are concerned with fairness , even if it 's for other people , not for themselves . 
  balkanians speak out against lack of fairness only if they 're involved . 
  * ** equality ** : regardless of rank or wealth , scandinavians are not smug with their co-workers . 
  also , when someone does something wrong , they do n't impale him/her * ** calmness ** : i have yet to see an angry scandinavian , a state that was the default for some people in some romanian companies where i worked . 
  * ** constructiveness ** : when things go wrong , the first thing that romanians think is finding the culpable , scandinavians try to fix the actual problem . 
  you may think that these things are small , but it 's a world of difference for the workers . 
  in the balkans , the people hate their job and their boss and as soon as the boss looks away , they stop doing anything . 
  in scandinavia , people seem to enjoy working more because their work environment is friendlier and less stressful : bosses tend to be more like collaborators than evil dictators . 
  they get into the eu budget , of which half goes to the farmers ' subsidies . 
  so , the answer is yes . 
  well , the middle classes do n't have the lobbying power of big corporations . 
  if they really wanted to fix corporate tax avoidance , they could do it at eu level and fix the loopholes within one week ... 
  the problem is not that there are new taxes , but that they 're taxing the wrong people . 
  rich people find various loopholes and in practice pay very little tax , big corporations use other loopholes to pay little to no tax ( like the infamous dutch/irish sandwich ) , while the middle class and the small businesses struggle with the fiscality . 
  ... so banks ( almost all of them foreign-owned ) brought easy credit . 
  when the downturn came , the romanian government borrowed a lot of money from the imf to bail them out . 
  none of the money from imf went to the government , all of it went to national bank , which used it to lend it to the banks and to give money bank to them by reduce the mandatory reserves . 
  so we 're now paying interest on money we used to ** save the foreign-owned banks ** because they did foolish things . 
  great idea !, 
  starting to pay off ? 
  that means that in 5-6 years , we 'll be able to reach the gdp level from before the imf-mandated austerity started in 2008 !, 
  in romania , i know two blonde girls from the easternmost parts ( dobruja ) , although the map says under 1 % . 
  however , the region has been colonized by romanians during the last 150 years , and the original inhabitants were turks and tatars , who do n't have light hair at all . 
  so the map could be of the of the natives , not of the current inhabitants . 
  well , for instance , any attempt of reforming eu 's financial rules is going to meet a british veto , even if all the other 26 countries agree with the idea . 
  earlier this year , the eu leaders discussed the idea of having a `` financial transaction tax '' . 
  as expected , there were plenty of disagreements among the eu countries , about how to implement it and what to do with the money , but negotiations solved them . 
  the country that was the exception is britain : david cameron announced that britain will veto any such attempt and that he 's not willing to negotiate . 
  the financial transaction tax is not a big reform , but it 's a start . 
  if britain wo n't accept this , i 'm pretty sure they wo n't accept any of the deeper reforms needed for the european financial sector . 
   firstly , that is a joke . 
  seriously ? 
  i thought `` yes , minister '' is a documentary on british governance . 
  i said the eu , not the euro . 
  well , it 's a known thing that britain is sabotaging the eu . 
  that 's the reason why de gaulle originally vetoed its entry . 
  let me quote from the `` yes , minister '' show ( i ca n't find the youtube video , maybe it was taken down by bbc ? 
  ) :  ** sir humphrey : ** minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
   ** hacker : ** that 's all ancient history , surely ? 
   ** sir humphrey : ** yes , and current policy . 
  we ` had ' to break the whole thing [ the eec ] up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
   ** hacker : ** but surely we 're all committed to the european ideal ? 
   ** sir humphrey : ** [ chuckles ] really , minister . 
   ** hacker : ** if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
   ** sir humphrey : ** well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact ; the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up , the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
   ** hacker : ** what appalling cynicism . 
   ** sir humphrey : ** yes ... we call it diplomacy , minister .
