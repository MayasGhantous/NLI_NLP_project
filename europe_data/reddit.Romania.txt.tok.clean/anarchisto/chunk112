  horia-roman patapievici was chosen by president b\u0103sescu to be the head of the institute because he was one of b\u0103sescu strongest supporters . 
  before that , the head of the institute was a close associate of the then-ruling party , so the institute was never independent . 
  patapievici used to defend b\u0103sescu in every article he published in newspapers such as evenimentul zilei and even attacked the social-democratic leader ( geoan\u0103 ) , claiming there is a tape of him getting oral sex from a fellow party member . 
  patapievici is , ideologically , a very peculiar individual . 
  he wrote books about how romanians are the worst possible nation in europe , but also how the secular west is doomed and that orthodox christianity is the solution to many modern problems . 
  politically , he 's a libertarian , but the kind of libertarian who does n't mind when the state spends a lot of money for his perks . 
  on the other hand , it seems that he was a pretty good head of the institute and that many intellectuals support him , regardless of ideological differences . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** horia-roman patapievici constantly attacked the social-democrats for the last few years and now that they 're in power , they want him out of the institute . 
  many artists like him because , unlike his predecessors , he did more than just promote his friends . 
  and another million only in uk , germany and australia . 
  as a eu citizen , if i move to another country , i 'll be allowed to vote in the local and european elections , but not in the national elections . 
  first of all , many people left romania during the communist era or shortly after the 1989 revolution and see left-wing politics as something unambiguously `` evil '' . 
  also , there are many moldovans who have romanian citizenship ( romania grants citizenship for people whose grandparents were romanian citizens , and that includes most people of moldova ) . 
  the right-wing ( democratic-liberals ) typically are more supportive of moldova and hint an eventual union with them in the future . 
  most moldovans do n't support such a union , but the people who hold romanian citizenship and vote are more likely to support it . 
  on the other hand , people here know exactly that the right-wing is corrupt ( the left is just as corrupt , but their corruption acts was long ago ) and , also , austerity measures from the last 3-4 years affected many people , without helping the economy . 
  the `` foreigners '' voting for the right-wing parties is valid in many countries in eastern and southern europe . 
  among the french expats in london , sarkozy won the elections . 
  among the romanians abroad , the right-wing always win by a considerable percentage ( let alone the fraud typically occuring in romanian embassies in favour of the government ) . 
  the same is valid for serbs as well . 
  they should have an option : if they pay their taxes in greece , they have the right to vote , even from abroad . 
  it would n't be fair to tell people who live in greece ( and who actually pay those taxes ) what to do with their taxes . 
  the local authorities do n't care to do it . 
  they 're gypsies , therefore most people think they 're not completely human . 
  first of all , [ they had been slaves for 500 years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) , slavery being finally banned in 1856 . 
  after we abolished gypsy slavery , they were simply let go , they left the boyar/church estates with nothing but the clothes they wore . 
  no real nationwide integration program , there was no social protection , education or anything . 
  of course many roma are socially dysfunctional , we never did enough to integrate them . 
  they came from what is now pakistan and apparently , they were displaced during the early muslim invasions of india , roaming around toward europe as nomads for centuries . 
  gypsies are a race . 
  if you get a dark-skinned gypsy and wash him , give him an education and a business suit , he 's still going to be disregarded as a `` stinking gypsy '' in the eyes of most romanians . 
  people believe in stereotypes because it 's easier to dismiss every very complex issue using a simple one . 
  gypsies are thieves , greeks are lazy , jews are greedy , russians are drunkards . 
  you find a reason for everything using these stereotypes . 
  let 's say that you get born to a roma family . 
  you are 4 years old . 
  you want to play with other kids on the playground , but the other kids ' parents shoo you away because they do n't want their kids to play with a gypsy . 
  you are 8 year old . 
  the classmates make fun of you , call you names and , being the only gypsy in the class , you 're regularly addressed as `` the crow '' . 
  the teachers find that funny and support them . 
  you are 12 years old . 
  the teachers are always be unfair to you because you 're a gypsy and that means you must be really dumb , regardless of the actual academic results . 
  you are 16 years old . 
  the restaurant waiters always treat you badly , sometimes they even deny you service because of your dark skin . 
  no one ever acts nice to you because you 're a `` stinking gypsy '' and you do n't deserve it . 
  afterall , because of people with your skin romania has a bad reputation in europe . 
  you are 20 years old . 
  surprisingly for a gypsy , you get to college and you want to get a summer internship job . 
  you get some interviews , but they always turn you down after seeing your skin colour because you 'll probably steal from the company . 
  no wonder they 're not all cuddly and warm . 
  here , no one will hire roma people because `` everyone knows that gypsies are thieves/criminals '' . 
  this means that the only jobs they get are street sweepers , garbagemen , janitors and florists . 
   good to know you 're a foreigner , easily judging from outside . 
  of course , no one understood the nazis , either . 
   that 's why i hate their thieves and criminals , not because their orgins or skin color . 
  just like the nazis hated the jews because they were money-grabber parasites , not because they had big noses , right ? 
  with this statement , you 're just proving that you 're a racist . 
   you come here and live with gypsies for a few days , live among them , and try helping them became better persons . 
  have you ever tried helping a roma person ? 
  i bet that the answer is no . 
  racism is deeply-ingrained in romanian society and denial is part of it . 
  most romanians consider the roma foreigners and they are less integrated in the society than immigrants in western countries . 
  do you remember how a couple of years the romanian foreign minister said that it would be better if the gypsies went back to egypt ? 
  ( disregarding the fact that they came from india , not from egypt ) or how many people , casually in conversation , propose kicking them out of the country to where they came from ? 
  a few more details : * the roma were taken out of the city into a disused copper/chemical plant in buildings that used to be chemical laboratories * the laboratories where those people were moved have are obviously not proper for habitation ( lacking enough bathrooms , kitchens ) * the mayor 's campaign was focused on `` cleaning up '' the city ( obviously referring to the roma ) * he got the highest percentage of any mayor of a city in romania ( 86 % ) * local police intimidates journalists trying to spend time or discuss with the roma : they kick out any such `` intruder '' claiming that they 're trespassing city property, 
  giving money at absurdly high interest rates ? 
  that 's like a greek gift . 
  there were several thousand people at the protests . 
  if the protests were peaceful ( i.e. 
  the gendarmes would n't have attacked the protesters ) , i 'm sure there would have been tens of thousands or more . 
  now , since there have been street fightings , the government can just claim that there were just a few ` extremist hipsters and pensioners ' who are not representative for the population . 
  yes , indeed : the evil opposition parties are trying to manipulate the people who are otherwise happy with the government . 
  the fact that the government has 15-20 % support has absolutely nothing to do with the protests . 
  romania spends only 4 % of its gdp for the state-run healthcare system : by far the lowest percentage in the european union , the average being 9-10 % ( and of a higher gdp/capita , too ! ), 
  and much of it is grafted by top and mid-level politicians . 
  if you want a good healthcare system , you need to start this way : * give the health system ** more money ** , at least to the average of the eastern eu members ( 8 % of the gdp ) . 
  hospitals are awfully underfunded and understaffed . 
  * give doctors a ** living wage ** . 
  you ca n't seriously expect junior mds to live on a 200-300 euro/month salary . 
  with that money , in bucharest , you ca n't even afford rent , utilities and food . 
  * ** depoliticize ** and decentralize the system : everything is now run by the government 's corrupt bureaucrats . 
  the first thing that a new government does is to replace everyone who has even a modicum of power with its own incompetent minions . 
  hungarian extremists want their old greater hungary back , as seen [ in this outline of the country ] ( http://thecontrarianhungarian.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/jobbik-supporters.jpg ) . 
  greater hungary would have 17-18 million ( 60 % ) non-hungarians and 12 million ( 40 % ) hungarians . 
  basically , if it 's a democracy , we 'll rule hungary . 
  turkey is in an on-going civil war . 
  in the last 30 years , 50,000 to 100,000 people have been in killed in fighting and there have been countless unarmed civilians killed by both sides : kurdish bombings and turkish military 's revenge attacks of kurdish villages . 
  in cyprus , there 's a `` frozen war '' due to the turkish invasion of northern cyprus . 
  until they retreat their military and the turkish colonists from the island , greece , cyprus and a few other countries wo n't allow turkey in . 
  they should solve their problems before joining the eu . 
  the president announced that they 're giving up on the law regarding the privatization of healthcare . 
  nevertheless , many public service monopolies have been privatized already ( typically the government receiving almost nothing for them ) , including electricity , water and gas distribution . 
  it 's not just housing that is more expensive in the uk : a u-bahn ticket in berlin is $ 2.30 . 
  in london , it 's $ 5.10 . 
  the average beer costs $ 3.42 in the uk , but $ 2.50 in germany ( according to pintprice.com ) and [ almost everything else is more expensive ] ( http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/berlin/london ), 
  uk households are `` wealthier '' because the prices of the houses in the uk are much , much higher than those in germany : * uk , average house price ( 2011 ) : # 241,461 = $ 288,682 * germany , average house price ( 2011 ) : $ 174,707 and the main reason why the houses are more expensive in the uk is that the brits are more likely to take loans . 
  if you exclude the home in which they live , probably the germans are wealthier . 
  the only macedonian i 've ever know insisted he 's not a bulgarian . 
  yes , he speaks perfectly bulgarian , yes , he lives just across the border from bulgaria , but he 's absolutely sure that bulgarians and macedonians are completely different people speaking very different languages . 
  a thing that nobody talks about , but it 's important when taking decisions on the eu expansion is the demography , especially population growth .
