   renewable energy is ridiculously more expensive than shale gas . 
  if you consider the cost of pollution is zero , yes , that 's true . 
   green movement is still full of people with main goal of destroying the western world you make them sound like they 're incarnate evil . 
  we do n't become `` energy independent '' by using shale gas . 
  the companies that hold the shale gas technology are american and the exact details of the technology are secret . 
  we will become dependent on the us instead of russia . 
  we 're still going to pay a lot for gas , but this time , we 'll be paying to american companies for our gas . 
  also , nobody seems to see the elephant in the room : oil . 
  russia exports more than 20 times more oil ( by value ) than natural gas to the eu . 
  ** romania ** * morome\u021bii * ( the moromete family ) by marin preda , two volumes about the life in an ordinary village in southern romania focusing on a regular patriarchal family called `` moromete '' . 
  the first volume ( published in 1955 ) is about country life before pre-wwii and the hardships of the era ( high debt and taxes , etc ) which lead towards a dissolution of the traditional society . 
  the second one ( published in 1967 ) is about the post-war era , when the collectivisation of agriculture leads to further fractures into the rural society . 
  no , neither the us nor russian actions are justified . 
  the biggest critics of russia seem to be people who think the us actions are justified , whereas russia 's are not . 
  as a chomskyist , i can tell you that russia is acting equally imperialistic as the united states , but some people can not see the beam in their own eyes . 
  an imperialist power acts like an imperialist power . 
  they secede countries without regard of international law . 
  ( see kosovo ) they invade other countries based on their interest . 
  ( see iraq ) they take away territories ( see guantanamo bay in cuba ) . 
  people who see the us or russia as good are looking the other way when there are some inconvenient facts . 
  maybe , but i do n't understand why . 
  putin has ideologically little to do with the left-wing . 
  he 's more of the conservative populist kind . 
  the state recognized it and it made an investigation commission which concluded that between 280,000-380 .000 jews and 11.000-18 .000 roma people were killed by the romanian authorities ( army , police , gendarmes ) , by romanian paramilitaries or in the territories administered by romania ( by the german einsatzgruppen ) . 
  however , there are plenty of people who do n't recognize it or simply never heard of it . 
  during the communist era , there was no emphasis made on the holocaust as being something special : it was considered to be just part of the crimes made by the fascists . 
   usually they end up annexing a bit more land than the last time on the other hand , we also tried to annex odessa and our army only killed over 100,000 civilians in the region . 
  ( mostly jews ) see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_odessa_massacre, 
  it 's international trolling . 
  they 're doing this just to spite the russians . 
  but economic sanctions do work !, 
  just look how well they did in cuba : the us began restrictions against the castro government in 1959 and it fell right away ... oh , wait , it did n't ... 
  romania spends yearly 825 $ per capita for social protection , while france 6970 $ . 
   in romania the budget is roughly 30 % of gdp , while in france it 's about 60 % . 
  there are plenty of reasons why the budget is so small , one of them being that romania has no taxes on wealth and very low taxes on property . 
  for instance , for a bucharest apartment worth 100,000 $ , i pay 40 $ / year in property taxes , so it 's only 0.02 % . 
  for comparison , in the us , the typical tax rate is between 1 % and 2 % ( for instance , in nyc it 's 1.76 % , in texas 2.57 % , with calfornia as an exception with only 0.68 % ) . 
  i was n't able to find similar figures for europe , though . 
  yes , but from the ukrainian point of view , those are still ukrainian citizens , coming from an ukrainian region . 
  otherwise , they 'd have to recognize that crimea is no longer their territory . 
   pro-russia versus , for lack of a better word , pro-ukraine sentiment in odessa is split down the middle . 
  since the maidan protests began , the ukrainian supporters have held nightly meetings at the monument to the duc de richelieu , the first governor of odessa , at the top of the potemkin steps . 
  the anti-maidan , as they call themselves , the pro-russian activists , meet at a fairground near the railway station . 
  the pro-russian marchers have so far mostly avoided the violence that has characterised the demonstrations in kharkiv and donetsk . 
  so basically , there 's no clear majority in the city . 
  in the odessa oblast ( which also has some rural areas ) 85 % of the people are russian speakers according to the last census . 
  we can safely assume that in the city of odessa , over 90 % speak russian as a native language , so language is not the issue here , as there are very few ukrainian speakers . 
  the ethnicity is a more complicated thing , as many people are of mixed heritage , so you ca n't say it 's one or the either because they 're both russian and ukrainian at the same time . 
  so , in this case , the people are divided into those two camps by personal preference , not by ethnicity or language . 
  yes , but what is the percentage of people who hold active combat roles in the greek military are women ? 
  my guess is under 2 % . 
  in canada , they 're 2 % , while in france 1.7 % . 
  or more like 50 % , which is the percentage of romanians of working age who are not working . 
  the unemployment rate is a pointless piece of statistics , imo . 
  the employment-to-population ratio is much better . 
  we have to pay out of our pocket many things that are `` free '' in the west . 
  for instance , public healthcare is supposed to be nearly free in romania , with relatively small co-pays . 
  in practice , you must pay a bribe to everyone in public hospitals to get any attention . 
  otherwise , everyone ( including doctors and nurses ) will just ignore you . 
  this is why there are now so many private hospitals ( for which you have to pay the out of your pocket ) . 
  that 's because in many western countries , the tax rates are different for people who have children , or it depends on the wife 's / husband 's income , etc. 
  here , it 's the same for everyone . 
  hehe , `` i do n't care about your stupid ethnic dances , i want dirty jokes ! '', 
  net, 
  in romania , there have been on social media many opinions ( some of them going viral ) about how it 's not worth to risk one 's life in a war for preserving the privileges of the corrupt elite and the oligarchs , while the rest lives in poverty . 
  because of this , a leading journalist warned of the `` dangers of social media '' :  social networks are a perfect tool to induce a state of panic , anxieties and collective psychosis and even to stimulate distrust in national values , the romanian military capability or the superiority of a foreign army . 
  he argues that the hundreds of thousands of romanian peasants did n't knew either what they were fighting for , but that did n't mean they were n't heroes when they fought against the soviet union at the battle of stalingrad . 
  ( i do n't think bringing up `` the heroes '' fighting for nazi germany is a good way to promote patriotism ) -- in a different discussion on conscription in case of war , our president b\u0103sescu noted that millions of young and able romanians live and work abroad and he was thinking about how to bring them back in case of war . 
  again , the public discussion led to the question of whether those people should care about the country which they had to leave due to poverty and unemployment . 
  if we take wwii as an example , the men are supposed to be killed , whereas the women are left alive to be raped by the victors . 
  at least during wwii both sides did this : * germans : [ german military brothels in world war ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_military_brothels_in_world_war_ii ) * soviets : [ rape during the occupation of germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany ) * japanese : [ korean and chinese `` comfort women '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comfort_women ) * americans : [ rape during the occupation of japan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_japan ) , [ rape during the liberation of france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_liberation_of_france ) etc. 
  our statistics office does n't like the median wage because it 's way too close to the minimum wage , so they only publish the average wage . 
  * minimum wage : 160 $ * median wage : ~ 220 $ * average wage : 360 $, 
  for saudi arabia , it 's not visa on arrival . 
  it 's another shade . 
   holding a glass of wine in my hand because it is pa\u0219tele blajinilor motherfucker some context : according to romanian/moldovan folklore , there are some mythological beings called `` blajini '' , small people ( like hobbits ) , but who are only capable of doing good things . 
  they live on another world ( `` across the river '' ) without any contact with the humans and they do n't know when the easter is , so on easter , people put dyed egg shells to flow down the river towards them , so they 'd know when to celebrate it . 
  the egg shells are said to reach them only after eight days and that is when they celebrate easter . 
  and for some reason , the romanians in our world also celebrate it . 
  the eu has some worthy goals , but almost no power to take any measures in order to achieve those goals . 
   add 16 million jobs in just 6 years ? 
  i doubt that is possible . 
  i think it will be hard to keep the current job levels , let alone add 16 million jobs . 
  i can see that the targets were set in 2010 and that since then , the employment rate has been going down . 
   what the eu is doing is trying to get around its wto obligations by refusing cheap american corn and soybeans . 
  the eu is not a large producer of soybeans , so i do n't see th point in claiming that we 're concerned about cheap us imports . 
  also , american maize is cheap not because of gmos , but because of government subsidies . 
  the moment the us and eu stop the subsidies , the first-world farmers would have a hard time to compete with third-world farmers . 
  isitbannedinrussia.com/moldovan_wine -  yes isitbannedinrussia.com/georgian_mineral_water -  yes isitbannedinrussia.com/lithuanian_dairy -  yes isitbannedinamerica.com/cuban_rum -  yes isitbannedinamerica.com/french_mimolette_cheese -  yes, 
  the crimean people will consider this a hostile act towards them , rather than towards russia . 
  it will affect and annoy the people who were still loyal to ukraine . 
  the kiev government thinks that they 'll never have any chance to regain crimea , so what the crimeans think is irrelevant . 
  so that means that an additional batch of putin advisers will no longer be able to go to disneyland ? 
  that 's nothing compared with other crazy stuff romanian drivers do . 
  for most of our history , many romanians ( `` vlachs '' ) were also `` stateless and nomadic '' . 
  they were shepherds who kept moving their flocks of sheep towards better pastures throughout eastern europe . 
  from czech republic to crimea , from southern poland to greece , there were romanian populations of shepherds . 
  but everywhere they settled they integrated and they 're no longer nomadic . 
  in some places they still speak some romanian dialects : [ the istro-romanians of istria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istro-romanians ) ( croatia ) , [ the aromanians of greece , albania and macedonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians ) , while in other areas , there are only ethnographical remains , for instance in the [ moravian wallachia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_wallachia ) of czech republic or parts of bosnia and serbia . 
  without asking the malgasy people if they want that or the roma people if they want to move to africa ?
