   if they commit a crime , punish them . 
  oh , but they do punish them , if not the justice system , then the police . 
  police beatings and torture of roma people are not at all uncommon . 
  apart from a few ngos ignored by everyone , no one is outraged . 
  things would have been very different if this involved a romanian , of course , but if it 's a roma , it 's acceptable . 
  once in a while , a small-time roma lawbreaker gets killed by the police beatings ; a month ago , a guy died of the beatings ( `` ruptured spleen '' ) . 
  the most common opinion on romanian forums was that `` he deserved it '' . 
   wow , you 're seriously comparing deporting illegal migrants back to the country of their birth , where they 've lived for many generations , with deporting them back to a country where there ancestors came from thousands of years ago ? 
  yes , that 's the public discourse in romania , even among the most educated people . 
  they 're considered `` not romanian '' , `` foreign '' , even thought they 've been here for 700 years . 
  everything is boring in denmark : * boring weather -- just rain , very mild climate , no extreme temperatures * boring landscape -- very flat , it 's telling that their himmelbjerget ( `` the sky mountain '' ) has a height of only 147 meters above sea level . 
  * things and systems work , which is again boring -- on the other side of the continent , italians appear quite entertained by machinery that does n't work . 
  * life is so nice that it 's boring . 
  i like to call it realism . 
  wind power is replacing our coal plants , not oil . 
  largest coal exporters are australia and indonesia , which make up more than half of the world 's coal exports . 
  but romania also has enough coal if we really need it . 
  we still have to pay russia or some oil sheik to import oil . 
   romania has the highest wind potential in south eastern europe of 14,000 mw so we have more wind potential than bulgaria and serbia ? 
  that 's not saying much . 
  [ here 's a map of wind speed at 80 meters . 
  romania barely registers on this map , when compared with the northern europe shore ] ( http://www.3tier.com/static/ttcms/us/images/support/maps/3tier_5km_global_wind_speed.jpg ) . 
  [ another map , from the eu website , of europe 's potential by region ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/images/slideshow/images1/map1_77_wind_loadhours.jpg ) . 
  the reason we have so much renewable energy is corruption . 
  some big european energy companies `` lobbied '' ( read `` bribed '' ) the government to increase the subsidies to what were at one time the highest in the eu . 
  since the subsidies are paid directly by the consumers on their electricity bill ( currently , i pay around 50 $ / year in green subsidies ) , it did n't affect the government , so they approved them . 
  for each euro invested in wind power , they 'd get green subsidies of around 3 $ over 20 years , in addition to the electricity they sold on the local electricity market , so it was an excellent deal for them . 
  as expected , we had a lot of companies building wind turbines even though romania is n't the best place in europe for that . 
  now , for the next 20 years , we 'll have to pay for them . 
  the failure of the left-wing parties to provide good left-wing policies . 
  in most countries , the `` socialist '' or `` social-democratic '' parties no longer have anything socialist in them but the name . 
  these parties continue to follow the neoliberal consensus , so people became disillusioned with them , failing to see any difference between them and the conservatives . 
  as such , the people try to find an alternative and the right-wing populists are the only ones there . 
  on international politics , law has always been and it will always be a joke . 
  no powerful country ever abides law or morals , it 's always realpolitik . 
  [ jerry , just remember . 
  it 's not a lie ... if you believe it ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn_psjsl0lq ), 
  actually , the parts of moldova that were in the roman empire were part of the [ moesia superior ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/romanempire_117_-_moesia_superior_and_moesia_inferior.svg/800px-romanempire_117_-_moesia_superior_and_moesia_inferior.svg.png ) province . 
   you mean the people who were heavily armed and took hostages in the government buildings in kiev a couple of weeks back who were torturing politicians who were opposing them ? 
  terrorists on our side = freedom fighters . 
  actually , in some countries ( mine included ) there is corruption involved in virtually every contract between the state and a private company . 
  but it 's hard to prove a corruption case , particularly one involving a multinational because they have pretty good know-how about how to do it . 
  virtually all convicted politicians in romania involved local companies . 
  in one case of a bechtel contract for building a motorway ( in which romania paid billions and got almost nothing in return ) , the prosecutors were not able to do anything because the documents ( including the original contract ) have been lost by the ministry of transportation . 
  or , in the case of more corrupt countries , you bribe some politicians to give you some permits that are outrageously polluting . 
  the locals protest and the government revokes the permits as having being given illegally . 
  the corporation sues and gets billions in loss of profits . 
  everyone 's happy , except the people : the foreign corporation got its profits and the corrupt politicians got their bribes . 
  but if isds is accepted by the us , eu and the trans-pacific partnership countries , you have two-thirds of the world 's economy ( gdp , nominal ) and all the developed countries , so there 's absolutely no benefit for any country . 
  the corporations will benefit because their risks will be lower . 
   i can see the logic behind the isds and the benefits it could provide in fdi fdi is pretty much a zero-sum game , so if everyone accepts the isds , the benefits would be just for the corporations . 
   buying 50 more tanks and 10 fighter jets for that money will be laughed off by a russian officer yes , but they need to save the us war industry who need orders worth 31 billion $ . 
  because you use resources which do n't increase the standard of living for anyone . 
  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_broken_window#the_opportunity_cost_of_war, 
  first of all , the children did n't get to choose their parents , so it 's not their fault their family is poor enough to not afford enough nutritious food . 
  you can also blame the parents for being poor . 
  but this is not just personal responsability , it 's also the luck of being born in a rich country : only 1 % of the swedish children live in poor families ( according to unicef ) , whereas half the bulgarian or romanian children are classified as such . 
  you may argue that they could move in rich countries : although it 's not easy ( for many reasons ) , many millions of poles , romanians or bulgarians did move to western europe . 
  but this is not solving the social problems for the people who stay at home . 
  no , i did not say that . 
  the huge sums used for military spending prove that the polish government has enough money to solve these pressing social issues , but it does n't want to do it . 
  in the meantime , [ 1.4 million polish children are living in poverty ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/160774,14-million-polish-children-living-in-poverty ) ; of these :  over half a million polish children are unable to eat a meal containing meat , fish or poultry ( or a nutritious vegetarian equivalent ) even once every two days , because their parents can not afford it . 
  but tanks are more important than giving children nutritious meals so they can grow into healthy adults . 
  in romania , the taxes on profit are low ( 16 % ) , whereas the taxes on work are very high ( ~ 50 % ) . 
   you want to reduce yourselves from having the influence of texas to the influence of rhode island the catalans who do n't consider themselves spanish think their opinion does n't matter at all in spain , so it 's from going to nil to something . 
   you want to militarily cripple yourselves ? 
  lulz okay . 
  go for it . 
  shit , it 's better for my country , russia & china . 
  our influence grows at the expense of spain , people do n't care about the military . 
  they want better lives . 
  the irrelevant swedes ( 1 % of their gdp used for the military ) are better off than the russians ( 4.5 % of their gdp used for the military ) . 
  they do n't want to rely on just one supplier , but china 's oil consumption keeps increasing , so they wo n't mind getting more oil from russia . 
   oil is fungible , and unlike natural gas fairly easy to transport by sea . 
  europe produces enough natural gas by itself ( well , if we include norway ) for household consumption and heating . 
  the chemical industry is what uses the bulk of natural gas we import from russia . 
  if we would stop importing gas from russia , we 'd have to close down some fertilizer factories ( which use the [ haber process ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haber_process ) ) and import that fertilizer instead . 
   i assume that we could stop buying russsian oil relatively easily . 
  this would be pointless because russia will sell it to china instead . 
  we would just end up paying a bit more for oil , without affecting russia 's finances . 
   how does one extract coal from the ground in a sustainable way ? 
  sustainable is just a buzzword . 
  he does n't really mean it . 
  europe relies on russian oil : 35 % of all oil consumed in the european union is from russia . 
  that 's worth around $ 170 billion/year . 
  as long as we long as we buy a large portion of our oil from them , it does n't matter how much coal and shale gas we extract . 
   if they are unemployed if labour costs become too high i do n't think there 's such a problem in switzerland : their unemployment rate is 3.3 % ( april 2014 ) , which is basically `` full employment '' . 
  the solution is very easy : use fingerprints validation of votes . 
   that does n't look even remotely safe . 
  for their disregard of basic safety precautions , the vrontadosians can be named honorary russians . 
  there has always been some kind of a hive mind . 
  just look at one or two year-old threads about roma people and how much hate was oozing around . 
  however , that hive mind was a `` grassroots '' hive mind . 
  now it 's worse about russia ( i do n't know how grassroots or astroturfing it is ) and this subreddit is definitely worse than / r/worldnews . 
  on the other hand , on us-related topics , / r/worldnews has recently become more pro-american ; now comments in there are defending killing civilians with drones ... 
   the eu relies on russia for about 35 percent of its crude oil needs and 30 percent for gas eu oil consumption : 12.8 million bbl/day * 365 days * 0.35 = 1635 million bbl/year 1635 million barrels of oil * $ 104/barrel = $ 170 billion next time you drive , remember you 're financing russia and saudi arabia .

  also , in most of the europe , football hooligans do n't get indicted for crimes against humanity . 
  basically , they were helped by the securitate to funnel some funds into a secret account , probably in order to use for bribes elsewhere .
