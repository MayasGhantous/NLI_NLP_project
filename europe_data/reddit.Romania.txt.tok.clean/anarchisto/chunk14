  the west supported kiev protesters ( with money and intelligence ) who illegally occupied state buildings and then toppled the president ( without respecting the ukrainian constitution ) . 
  russia supported crimea and eastern ukrainian protesters ( with equipment and intelligence ) who illegally occupied state buildings and attempted secession ( without respecting the ukrainian constitution ) . 
  according to the western press , the first ones are `` freedom fighters '' , the second ones are `` terrorists '' . 
  according to the russian press , the first ones are `` fascists '' , the second ones are `` freedom fighters '' . 
  as someone who is not pro-russia , but neither pro-american/pro-nato , i find it futile to write in / r/europe since anything that is not pro-american gets quickly 20 downvotes . 
  i found it strange that the public opinion in other romanian-language ( or french-language ) forums seem to be more nuanced than in / r/europe , even though romanians are generally far more anti-russian than the average european . 
  also , any article that has any other perspective than the one of the mainstream anglo-american press gets downvoted quite quickly . 
  plenty of reasons : * the authoritarian regime : hundreds of protesters arrested whenever there 's an anti-governmental protest . 
  * beating , torturing and killing journalists and dissidents . 
  ( bloggers get arrested under the charge of `` hooliganism '' ) . 
  * lack of democratic freedoms : the opposition parties boycotted the last elections , because they were not free and fair * the cult of personality of which you find out right when you land at the [ aliyev international airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heydar_aliyev_international_airport ) * the corruption ( azerbaijan has a honorable place # 139 in the world 's least corrupt nations ), 
  do n't let facts ruin a good story !, 
  like they used chess during the cold war . 
  ( see the [ match of the century , 1972 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_chess_championship_1972 ) ), 
  of course not . 
  but not even a million tanks in estonia would scare russia because conventional weapons are not going to be used against a nuclear power . 
  the percentage of gdp does n't matter much . 
  buying a tank , a ship or a plane costs the same regardless of your gdp . 
   russia 's behavior is not par with 21st century european standards why is n't anyone outraged about turkey 's behaviour ? 
  their government is not par with 21st century european standards , either . 
  [ they 're imprisoning dozens of journalists critical to the government ] ( http://www.cpj.org/reports/2013/12/second-worst-year-on-record-for-jailed-journalists.php ) , they use the military to terrorize the civilians in kurdish villages , etc. 
  oh , the turkish governmen is on * our * side . 
   i am assuming you are pro-russian ?!, 
  as a true european traitor !, 
  traitor !, 
  a huge military is useless . 
  the eu already spends several times more than russia . 
  russia wo n't be more scared if we spend 4 times as much as them instead of 3 times . 
  russia spends $ 87 billion ; france , uk , germany and italy alone spend more than $ 200 billion . 
  also , gas is not that important to russia . 
  more than half of the russian government 's incomes are from oil , only 5 % is from gas and probably only 2-3 % is from gas exported to the eu . 
  if we really want to fight autocrats in russia and saudi arabia , we need to switch from oil & gas to other energy sources . 
  like deformed male genitalia . 
  not even if it has works of art featuring nudity like [ goya 's la maja desnuda ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2kzjn6t.jpg ) ( spain ) or [ titian 's dana\u00eb ] ( http://static7.depositphotos.com/1298242/789/i/950/depositphotos_7894644-soviet-russia-postage-stamp-painting-dana-titian-woman-nude.jpg ) ( soviet union ) or [ grigorescu 's nude ] ( http://t1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/32/04/54/400_f_32045431_wc3wivvhlgglxd6hrhamiur1jptjc6dy.jpg ) ( romania ) or [ picasso 's female nude ] ( http://www.colourbox.com/preview/7834043-910962-equatorial-guinea-circa-1974-a-stamp-printed-in-equatorial-guinea-dedicated-to-the-female-nude-in-art-history-shows-the-toilet-by-pablo-picasso-circa-1974.jpg ) ( guinea equatorial ) , etc. 
   the average net wage in romania seems to be 380 euros , not 200 . 
  the median is 250 $ , the average is 380 $ . 
  the average is skewed by the very large incomes , so the median is a better indicator of what the average romanian earns . 
   romania has in fact one of the lowest unemployment figures in whole of eu so jobs are not that scarce as you make it seem romania has the lowest employment figures in the eu ( or at least , it had , now maybe greece is slightly below ) because jobs have been scarce longer than a year or two , so long-term unemployed people slipped from the unemployment registry . 
  fewer than half of the working age residents are employed . 
  the rate for western european and the us is 65-70 % and in scandinavia 75-80 % . 
  speaking of dealing-with-your-past , how do the belgians deal with king leopold 's colonial past ? 
  up to 10 million congolese died due to the starvation , massacres , disease , etc. 
  directly related to the congo free state . 
  does the belgian state considers itself responsible or do they claim it was all king leopold 's fault ? 
  i can see that belgium even issued a [ king leopold ii commemorative euro coin ] ( http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces22411.html ) , so the public opinion is definitely not on par with hitler in germany . 
  unfortunately , the economic growth is not affecting everyone equally : * bucharest is indeed booming , but most of the country has been stagnating for the last decade . 
  * there are relatively few `` middle class '' workers , mostly concentrated in bucharest and a few bigger cities . 
  * half of the workers earn between 160-250 $ / month ; a third earn the minimum wage . 
  * there are very high inequalities in income ; for instance , as a programmer ( with a rather average wage for my position ) , i earn 10 times the minimum wage . 
  * in most of the country there are no employment opportunities , leading to millions of people working abroad : over a million romanians now live in italy , another million in spain and perhaps another million across the rest of the countries ( germany , uk , scandinavia , france , etc ) . 
  fight against corruption is actually working ( with dozens of mps , a dozen ministers , a prime-minister and countless mayors in prison for corruption and bribe-taking ) , but this failed so far to change the political class . 
  they are just as corrupt as they have ever been . 
  i 'm extrapolating the development of romania ( or bulgaria , or hungary ) during the last 25 years . 
  it 's probably going to be invalidated by technological and geopolitical changes , but if things stay as they are , there wo n't be any fast economical development . 
  actually , it 's because that 's how the founders wanted it . 
  the next states had to accept the status quo to get in . 
  i 'm not claiming it 's powerless . 
  the european parliament may amend a draft law , but it may not initiate a law that the commission does not want . 
  the european parliament is the direct representative of the people , why should we have another institution that is not directly elected to get a veto right ? 
  if things happen like in romania , kiev will be better off , while the small cities and the countryside will be worse off . 
  millions of people from the countryside and the small cities will move to western european countries to work on low-level jobs . 
  members of european parliament can write a legislation and pass it to the commission , which must approve it . 
  basically , if the european commission does n't want a piece of legislation , they will have no problem rejecting it . 
  the parliament proposed a lot of good laws which were then vetoed by the european commission . 
  however , even if they joined the european union , it 's unlikely the average ukrainian will get the european living standards this century . 
  for more details , ask the bottom half of the romanian employees , who earn less than 200 $ / month . 
  but the european parliament has limited powers . 
  unlike virtually any national parliament , it can not write legislation , it can only vote `` yes or no '' for legislation written by the european commission . 
  a european parliament which could write the laws would be a great achievement , but unfortunately , giving the people 's direct representatives some real power is not on the agenda . 
  the agency existed ( under different names ) for ages , but it 's only recently that they started to have some results . 
  the reason why things started to change is that there is a new generation of prosecutors and judges who are more idealistic and not easily bribed . 
    `` running a pyramid scheme '' . 
  maybe they should n't run a pyramid scheme . 
   netherlands has it right in my opinion the only problem is that the part-time wages ( in netherlands and elsewhere ) are not living wages . 
  you ca n't raise a family on that . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  thanks . 
  also , 43 % of ethnic russians want the russian army in ukraine , 43 % oppose . 
  ( edit : fixed figures ) in the east , 59 % want association with russia , 20 % in the eu . 
  saudi arabia is one of the few countries in the world that do n't call themselves a `` democracy '' . 
  like it said , `` small '' means having a value less than $ 1.74 billion . 
  many of them have only a few thousands soldiers in each ( for instance , in a base located in romania they have currently have 1600 soldiers ) , but that does n't meant they are n't bases on foreign soil . 
  an ad hominem solves nothing in a debate . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the people in none of the middle eastern ( pakistan , saudi arabia , qatar , oman , united arab emirates , bahrain , afghanistan , etc ) and latin american countries ( brazil , cuba , etc ) want them . 
  for instance , in a pew opinion poll in pakistan , [ 74 % of people consider the us `` an enemy '' and only 8 % a partner . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/27/pakistani-public-opinion-ever-more-critical-of-u-s/ ) . 
  at the request of the government . 
  i bet the people in most of those countries do n't want them . 
  [ from a washington post article ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/ron-pauls-strange-claim-about-bases-and-troops-overseas/2012/02/08/giqapzpqzq_blog.html ) :  the defense department every year publishes a list of military facilities in the united states and around the world . 
  as of sept. 30 , 2010 , the dod list shows a list of 611 military facilities around the world ( not counting war zones ) , though only 20 are listed as `` large sites , '' which means a replacement value of more than $ 1.74 billion . 
  they do the same in romania . 
  sometimes , it 's not money , but paying all expenses for doctors to go to conferences held in a 5-star resorts on some tropical island . 
  also , not only drug companies , but also pharmacies : the doctors get a percentage of the sales if they convince to go to a certain company 's pharmacies . 
  a lot of the us military expenditure is keeping their hundreds of military bases across the world and paying for their ongoing wars . 
  ( afghanistan , pakistan , yemen , etc ), 
  what is the meaning of the black and orange ribbons the protesters wear ? 
  actually , austria is also not part of nato . 
  it declared its neutrality in 1955 . 
  hipster zhirinovski was there before it was cool !, 
  sweden has been officially neutral since 19th century , it 's part of their core national principles to be anti-militaristic .
