  even today , they spend only 1.2 % of their gdp on military , less than half the percentage what the uk and france spend and a bit more than a quarter of what the us spends . 
  finland had a policy to be in-between nato and ussr . 
  not pro-ussr , but neither pro-nato . 
  some called them cowards , others said it 's just a rational policy , nevertheless , they were able to have good trade relations with both the capitalist and socialist blocs throughout the cold war . 
  ( for instance , nokia , back then an industrial conglomerate , sold rubber boots to the red army ), 
  they should kill people bearing soviet flags the way the united states kills people bearing confederate flags ? 
  so do you agree with freedom of speech as long as it 's an opinion with which you agree ? 
  deportation for political opinions from the country where they were born sounds like something stalin would do . 
   putting sanctions on them would cripple the eu recovery for the eu , buying russian gas is more important than it is for russia to sell it . 
  more than half of the russian budget revenue is from oil and only 5 % is from gas ( and only half of that is to the eu ) . 
  for oil there is a global market , so if the eu refuses to buy oil , the russians would simply sell it to china . 
  that 's mostly money that was invested in oil and gas-related companies on moscow stock exchange . 
  unless the russian state wants to sell their shares in those companies , they 're not really affected . 
  also , there were some money that was invested in russian debt , but again , russia does n't rely on external debt , they rely on oil exports . 
  over half of the russian budget is made out of oil revenue and further 5 % is gas revenue . 
  maybe because there 's plenty of opportunity of employment for less educated maltese in the tourism industry . 
  there is a difference between the two figures : the one in the op , it 's people who * completed * education , this one is the people who * attended * higher education . 
  but , unless you have an unusually high dropout rate , you 'd probably still be better than ireland . 
   chavistas have turned that country into a smouldering trainwreck you make it sound like pre-chavez venezuela was a paradise . 
  they had huge unemployment rates , most people were dirt poor ( by that i mean third world `` extreme poverty '' , not the kind of poverty there is in the us or europe ) and had no access to healthcare and education . 
  of course venezuela remains a third-world country with a lot of crime , a high inflation rate and an economy dependent on oil exports , but all these were valid in pre-chevez venezuela as well . 
  from [ a guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/aug/05/scotland-higher-education-participation-inequality ) :  the higher education initial participation rate ( which measures the proportion of 16-30 year olds in higher education ) stood at 56 % in scotland in 2011 , 7 percentage points higher than england 's 49 % . 
  they sell `` il padrino '' t-shirts to unsuspecting tourists . 
  the titles for the [ nordic model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model ) article on wikipedia : * dansk : skandinaviske velf\u00e6rdsmodel * norsk : den skandinaviske samfunnsmodellen * \u00cdslenska : norr\u00e6na velfer\u00f0arkerfi\u00f0 * svenska : den ** svenska ** modellen, 
  i was under the impression that everyone in scandinavia thinks that about the swedes . 
   the article does n't really state the scale of how many mps are demanding this probably it 's zhirinovski . 
  my business selling pieces of the old berlin wall will sue russia for loss of profit !, 
  maz\u0103re was just arrested for bribe-taking . 
  the problem was that they were isolated into ghettos in the first place rather than being integrated . 
  there is segregation both in housing and education , there is discrimination in employment and then we ask why they do n't integrate . 
   in some countries around half of all roma pupils -- 58 per cent in slovakia and 45 per cent in hungary -- attend segregated classes . 
  in the czech republic , 23 per cent of roma pupils are in special schools . 
  [ source ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_speech-14-290_en.htm ), 
  probably they were not the kind of people who go often to the theatre . 
  actually , they were eventually arrested by the ukrainian police force . 
  they 're all ukrainian citizens . 
  no , they ca n't `` easily '' pay for them . 
  they have almost a trillion in deficit every year . 
  in order to start paying off their debt , the us must first reach the equilibrium and that 's far off . 
  well , in kiev there were plenty of ongs involved in the protests that were financed from the west . 
  ( by bigger ongs , private individuals or even governmental programs ), 
  people who illegally seized government buildings in kiev were ** freedom fighters ** . 
  people who illegally seized government buildings in kharkhiv are ** terrorists ** . 
  the position of ethnic russians from estonia and ukraine can be easily explained economically : gdp per capita ( ppp ) : * estonia $ 21,714 * russia $ 17,518 * ukraine $ 7,295, 
  there is just one us state which has a population similar to ukraine : california . 
  you are confusing terrorists with freedom fighters !, 
  if they 're on `` our side '' , they 're `` freedom fighters '' , if they are on the `` other side '' , they 're `` terrorists '' . 
  it depends on the isp . 
  some are great , some less so . 
  i once was connected to a small isp that always went down during rain . 
  if the internet was down , i knew right away that it just started to rain . 
   but this competition from small , fast and extremely cheap isps meant that the bigger isps ( which generally have a better quality ) had to upgrade their networks and lower prices to keep up with them . 
  it was a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  they were not able to finance their liabilities because everyone said they could not finance their liabilities . 
  it 's the same way as during a bank run : if everyone says that a bank ( any bank ) will fail , it will fail . 
  this has little to do with the bank 's financial data , but with way the financial system is organized . 
  the us conduct intelligence against every other country and no one is claiming that they want to have a world war against everyone . 
  stop spreading this bullshit if you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  during the 1993-2008 period , the greek debt as percentage of gdp remained constant . 
  in other countries , this would be called a `` sustainable '' financial policy . 
  in the greek case it 's `` living beyond their means '' . 
  the us has higher `` gross debt as percentage of gdp '' than greece had in 2008 . 
  japan has twice that percentage . 
  why is it that nobody is arguing that the us and japan are living beyond their means ? 
  since the `` crisis '' , the greek debt as percentage of gdp grew by more than half , much of which being due to skyrocketing interest rates ( until the eu intervened with a bailout ) . 
  if germany or the us were to pay a 30 % interest rate ( which was at a time , the interest rate at which greek could borrow from the free market ) , they 'd be bankrupt within a few years . 
  -- the greek government has been and still is extremely corrupt , but their financial situation is not directly linked to this . 
  actually , here , regular police may be armed , but gendarmes are not . 
  some countries call it `` riot police '' or `` militarized police '' . 
  that 's fucking insane . 
  how did you end up with so many ? 
  lack of enforcement of cable-laying regulations . 
   [ bucharest ended up like this in the process ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/mironghiu/sets/72157603402091510/ ) . 
  one interesting tidbit i found about northern ireland is that , according to the 2011 census , eastern european immigrants are more likely to identify themselves as `` irish '' or `` northern irish '' rather than `` british '' or `` english '' , while immigrants from india and pakistan consider themselves overwhelmingly `` british '' . 
  while for the indians , it 's understandable they feel closer to the `` british empire '' , i 'm not sure why the eastern europeans feel closer to the irish . 
  for some , it might be the shared religion ( poles and the catholic irish ) , but the irish/northern irish identity is also more common than british/english identity among romanians , who are not catholics . 
   wtf ? 
  getting your fridge delivered in venice is a huge pain in the ass . 
  how did they intend to do that ? 
  i bet their response would be : `` we did n't thought of that '' . 
  the scandinavians have a `` flexible '' labour market ( it 's easy to hire and fire ) , but with a very strong social safety net . 
  this system works better because , during a downturn , it wo n't lead to a decrease in consumer demand and there wo n't be a spiral of unemployment and production . 
  that 's hard to compute if you take it as a whole . 
  but hungary and croatia definitely had lower growth , czech republic had about the same and poland had higher growth . 
  poland 's high growth is rather an exception , though . 
   some people wo n't like it , but it is the only way to go . 
  europe is growing much less than other regions and we need to compete how can you explain the fact during the last 10 years , the european countries with lower salaries ( spain , portugal , italy , eastern europe ) grew ** far less ** than the european countries with high salaries ( norway , sweden , denmark ) . 
  i think in this whole affair , putin is the biggest troll . 
  unfortunately , eastern europe is falling for this . 
   there are so many ultranationalist around these days yeah . 
  i do n't know how overnight everyone turned out to be a nationalist and either love putin/russia or love the us ... 
   also , they follow the kyiv patriarchate of orthodoxy , which is more in line with christ 's teachings than russian orthodoxy [ i must have missed the part of christ 's teachings where it says that people should wear hats made out of gold and silver ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_att_ywjlbjq/tfa4jlqmu3i/aaaaaaaaajy/hq9c5iudezc/s320/filaret ), 
  indeed timi\u0219 started the company and he used some securitate connections to get the original contracts . 
  but i wo n't believe that newmont mining corporation and other major shareholders do n't know that the corporation uses bribery to obtain the mining permits . 
  even the whole corporate structure of corporation , channeling lots of money to subsidiaries in shady islands is obvious . 
   cultural indicators suggest that ukraine will go the path of slovakia , czech and poland . 
  i 'd argue that culturally , ukraine is closer to romania and bulgaria than to czechia and slovakia . 
  with them , we have in common the eastern orthodox , ottoman/turkic and russian influences . 
  also , belonging to one culture or another does not guarantees economic success : hungary belongs to the german cultural sphere of influence ( just like czechia and poland ) , but they were not as successful as them during the last decade . 
  actually , most of large shareholders are from the us .
