  many mining companies get listed in canada because if they have some pretty `` favorable '' legislation regarding environmental damage abroad . 
   well ... 
  i hate to say it but there 's a high likely hood that you are relatively super-rich . 
  i 'm not super rich if i make 10 times the world median income ( which is $ 3000/year ) . 
  the difference between me and the super-rich is far greater than between me and the median human . 
  world 's average gdp/capita is $ 10,000 . 
  since this gdp is generated only by the people economically active people ( children , elderly , disabled , etc ) , it 's safe to say that the average human produces about $ 15,000 . 
  the huge difference between the average and the median incomes just shows how much inequality there is . 
  then just choose your president between two oligarchs ( tymoshenko and poroshenko ) and call that `` democracy '' . 
  but most europeans live in countries ( mostly eastern , southern europe ) where there is no sense of fairness in politics and economics . 
   what is going to solve ? 
  the elites ( political and economical ) will realize that they ca n't do anything they want without consequences . 
  the 8-hour day , safety at workplace regulations , even the existence of a middle class etc. 
  were obtained through the deaths of thousands of protesters and strikers who were killed by the police and/or army . 
  people like to take sides , even if both sides are equally bastards . 
  it 's nice to have a fantasy of a `` good '' side and an `` evil '' side . 
  there are people who side with russia because they hate america , `` forgetting '' that russia is equally imperialist . 
  ( see chechnya ) there are people who side with america and every america ally because they hate russia , `` forgetting '' that some of those allies are scum . 
  ( see saudi arabia ), 
  well , there were 6 upvotes and 4 downvotes . 
  the downvotes are there because the turkish government is our nato ally against the anti-christ , err ... putin . 
  so their election frauds are forgiven , so are the banned websites , killed protesters , imprisoned journalists , false flag operations etc. 
  more like every week . 
  unfortunately , we are alike in political corruption . 
   north africa and the middle east have much more to do with european energy security than with us energy security it has nothing to do with `` energy security '' as it does with profits for their companies . 
  american and european oil companies want a cut of the potential profits of the oil industry in those countries . 
  the middle easterners and north africans will sell to whoever pays the world price . 
  since europe is the closest consumer to them , it makes commercially sense to sell it to them . 
  the chinese wo n't buy libyan oil because it does n't make sense to buy it from far away when you can buy oil ( at the same international price ) from closer sources . 
  even after all the cuts , nato still spends way too much : far more than the rest of the world put together . 
  since there is no match to nato 's spending , who are we going to fight ? 
  the martians ? 
  even with its `` low '' military spending , the eu as a whole spends three times what russia spends . 
  russia can defeat an individual eu country , but not all of us united . 
  i think it would be more important to integrate the eu militaries than to spend more . 
  in this case , it 's also that the percentage of the gdp that goes towards salaries is lower in eastern europe . 
  in nato no one respects the target except for the countries that have military influence ( us , uk , france ) and greece . 
  and no , i do n't think we should be more like greece . 
  do you think that even if we spent 10 % of the gdp for the military , we could hold off by ourselves the russians for more than a week or two ? 
  bucharest is a different place from the rest of the country . 
  in much of the country , even jobs requiring higher education are paid with the minimum wage ... 
  that 's the average , not the median . 
  the median is better at expressing what the average romanian earns . 
  the average is driven up by the top 5-10 % who have much higher wages . 
  the minimum wage is 190 $ / month , from which you withdraw taxes . 
  about a third of the workers get the minimum wage . 
  [ minimum wages in eastern and western europe ] ( https://www.google.ro/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:ro:bg:hu#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:ro:bg:hu:fr:cz:nl:be&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false )  how could you possibly live off that ? 
  not easily , that 's for sure . 
  not many . 
  most of them left since wwii . 
  yes , but the powerful nobility contrasted with the poverty of the average landless peasant . 
  and yet , medieval transylvania had a small middle class ( mostly german , or under german influence ) . 
  across the carpathians , in ottoman-ruled wallachia and moldavia there was even more polarization of wealth . 
  are you arguing that most romanians are not poor ? 
  the median income is 300 $ / month . 
  half the employees get less than that . 
   it looks like living standard in romania is very low . 
  yup , the median incomes are very low : under 300 $ / month and living standards are obviously proportional . 
  i 'd argue that 1 % are `` rich '' , 10 % are middle class , 40 % are aspiring middle class ( comparable with the western poor people ) and 50 % dirt poor . 
  ( the eu statistics talks about `` material deprivation '' in this case , generally there is no equivalent in western europe )  some says they still use horses to go around . 
  not in the cities , but in the countryside , horses and carts are a common way of transportation . 
  actually , they use horses for [ good old subsistence farming ] ( http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/beyond-brics/files/2012/04/solesti-romania.jpg ) . 
   funny thing is , going from a progressive to a flat income tax ( of 16 % ) reduced tax evasion in romania says who ? 
  tax evasion is still very very common . 
   why would anyone buy german widgets ? 
  because of market inertia . 
  the german widget company has a market , the czech company does n't . 
  the german widget company has european customers ( other companies ) that have used those widgets for decades . 
  those customers do n't know whether the slightly cheaper czech widgets are just as good as the german widgets and the costs associated with testing them out and making sure they 're compatible or comparable in quality are not worth it . 
   why are these high-wage jobs mostly in germany ? 
  because of inertia . 
  the costs associated with firing the germans and hiring in czech republic are greater than simply keeping the german staff . 
  in the cases it was cheaper to hire people in eastern europe , they have already did : outsourcing software is one example . 
  i work for a norwegian company that outsources its software development to bucharest , romania . 
  it 's a virtous/vicious cycle : the wages are high in germany because productivity is high . 
  productivity is high because they use highly-automated systems ( robots , software , etc ) in industry and services and they have to use automation because the wages are high and it 's cheaper to install a robot/software than to hire someone . 
  the wages are low in eastern europe because productivity is low . 
  productivity is low because we do n't use highly-automated systems ( robots , software , etc ) in industry and services and we do n't have to use automation because the wages are low enough and it 's cheaper to hire someone than to install a robot/software . 
  -- tldr : the wages are high in germany because wages are high . 
  the wages are low in eastern europe because wages are low . 
  norway is already at full employment ( 3 % unemployment rate ) , despite the high immigration rate , so there 's not much they can do and it 's probably the best they do n't do anything . 
  apparently , the author is bulgarian . 
  about 18 : in eastern europe , people do n't call a plumber , electrician , etc. 
  they try to fix everything themselves , even if they have no clue on how to do it . 
  it 's not even ( always ) about the money : it 's the principle that i can fix my sink better than that plumber !, 
  what is interesting is that stoltenberg , during his youth , was an anti-war activist , involved in protests against the vietnam war , against the militarist actions of the us ( in front of the american embassy in oslo ) and in groups demanding norway 's withdrawal from nato . 
  except , perhaps , people who actually like ceau\u0219escu , but then , they would n't do the comparison this way , but rather : `` they 're not as good as ceau\u0219escu '' . 
   right-wing norwegians on my facebook do not take lightly on this decision . 
  when there were elections in norway , on the comments sections of romanian newspaper articles about the elections , there were some vivid discussions on norwegian politics by romanians living in norway . 
  from there , i learnt that all norwegian parties are full of crooks , that norwegians are too naive for voting for them , and that stoltenberg is `` worse than ceau\u0219escu '' . 
   i found this whole thing funny because they applied the name-calling that is typical to romanian politics into the norwegian politics . 
  -- so my question is : is stoltenberg really worse than ceau\u0219escu ? 
  they compare it with the us , which spends around $ 700 billion a year . 
  russia spends around $ 90 billion . 
  indeed . 
  compared with the immense waste of money on conventional forces , this is just a drop in a bucket . 
  nevertheless , i keep seeing opinions in the european media about how the eu needs to greatly increase military spending : we spend only 200 billion $ a year on this . 
  if you have only 10-20 nuclear bombs , then the other side may disable them through precision bombing , sabotage , etc. 
  when there are tens of thousands , there 's no chance in hell of disabling them all . 
  the romanian army has no chance against the russian army , regardless of how much we spend .
