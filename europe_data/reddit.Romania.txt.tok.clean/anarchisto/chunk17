  if there 's an invasion ( and it 's almost certain there wo n't be , because we 're american land here ) , the only thing that would cause some real damage to the invader would be a guerrilla . 
   * the military industry is not a waste of resources . 
  * yes , it is a waste of resources that could be used for better quality of life for the people . 
  in the words of president dwight d. eisenhower :  every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed . 
    this world in arms is not spending money alone . 
  it is spending the sweat of its laborers , the genius of its scientists , the hopes of its children . 
  the cost of one modern heavy bomber is this : a modern brick school in more than 30 cities . 
  it is two electric power plants , each serving a town of 60,000 population . 
  it is two fine , fully equipped hospitals . 
  it is some fifty miles of concrete pavement . 
  we pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat . 
  we pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people . 
  this is not a way of life at all , in any true sense . 
  under the cloud of threatening war , it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron . 
  ...  * think about it in this way , a powerful army translates to stability for investors . 
  * which explains why sweden ( with its lousy 1.2 % of gdp military spending and being part of no military pact ) is so poor : nobody invests there . 
   * military research has a high and longterm return . 
  * on the other hand , on the nasa project the us spent a hundredth the sums spent on the military and it provided even more returns in technology . 
  imagine where we 'd be if we used all the arms money for civilian research . 
  dammit , poland , you only have a 10 z\u0142otych note in your wallet !, 
  the economists call this the [ broken window falacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_broken_window ) . 
  does n't it make more sense to do it the chinese way ? 
  use the money to build a lot of infrastructure instead of arms industry ? 
  infrastructure ( like high-speed trains , of which the chinese have more km than whole europe ) brings future productivity . 
  arms industry is just a waste of resources which brings wealth to some politically-connected companies . 
  when we have more and more poverty , inequality , large government debts , the solution to everything is more military spending !, 
  it sounds logical , does n't it ? 
  which war ? 
  during the syrian war , around 200,000 people died . 
  during the 2014 crimean war , how many died ? 
  the last death toll said two : one russian and one ukrainian . 
  of course policy of might is not something desirable , but let 's keep the proportions : the syrian war is not the same thing as the crimean invasion . 
  if you want to prevents untimely deaths , you 're better off asking for segregated facilities for cyclists in your city than protesting against the crimean invasion . 
   i never had doubts that in russia there 's many people still living with their minds in the 20th century [ ... ] putin is a sick person and is spreading his sickness through russia . 
  zhirinovsky is just a troll . 
  he has been trolling russia for two decades already , it 's just that now , when the world is following russia , the outrageous things he 's saying get an international audience . 
  he 's used with the old thinking : if a newspaper is bothering us , just close it down and the issue is solved . 
  ... and a few weeks after it 's ready , it will be sold for a tenth of its cost to `` strategic foreign private investors '' ? 
  the romanian national hydroelectric company is currently in bankruptcy due to corrupt deals with various private companies and the government started selling packs of shares from it . 
  the whole affair is so absurd because producing electricity hydro is much cheaper than anything else , so you ca n't go wrong unless you sell the electricity for 1/3 of the market price . 
  and that 's exactly what our governments ( the previous ones , too ) did . 
  something changed in / r/europe the last few weeks . 
  the commenters and people who upvote/downvote tended to have a rather balanced approach of international politics . 
  now if i speak against the hypocrisy of us and the english-language media about ukraine and russia , i quickly get my comment down to -10 and get treated as a traitor to the western world . 
   not exactly the first example of svoboda and right sector attacks is it ? 
  they 've been attacking their `` enemies '' for weeks now , spreading terror among them . 
  i 've seen footage of a group of svoboda people beating in the middle of the street ( with the apparent support of the crowd around ) a guy whom they claimed was a `` communist '' . 
  the police and the justice system wo n't do anything because svoboda controls them . 
  ... and financial interests ( uk ) ... and warships ( france ) ... 
  in romania , we have the s\u0103laj county . 
   these are russian sponsored provocateurs . 
  in such situations , it 's almost certain that there are foreign agents everywhere . 
  the cia and fsb are trying to move the events towards their own goals . 
  i would n't be suprised if the fsb has agent provocateurs inside the organizations spewing hate towards the russian minorities ( in order to justify russia 's military intervention ) , just as i would n't be surprised if the cia provided logistic support to the opposition regarding the snipers ( in order to justify the forceful ousting of yanukovich ) . 
  it 's a mean world of realpolitik and the big losers are the pure-hearted ukrainian people who fought for their beliefs . 
  and i heard the argument that * svoboda * are the `` moderate nationalists '' , not fascists , unlike the more tough * pravyi sektor * . 
  any finnish politicians wanting to join sweden ? 
  that 's not i meant , my point was that the argument of constutionality is nonsense . 
  none of the revolutions or declarations of independence were legal . 
  well , we should compare it with the other referendum this year : the referendum in catalunya is ** against the spanish constitution ** and condemned by the spanish prime minister . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2013/12/12/economia/1386874769.html ), 
   according to the oecd , greece is one of the few eu countries that sets prices for over-the-counter drugs , such as aspirin , and restricts their distribution solely to licensed pharmacies . 
  regulations limit the ownership of pharmacies to actual pharmacists ( and each pharmacist is allowed to own only one ) . 
  they dictate where new pharmacies may open , based on population and distance requirements . 
  in romania , it 's the other extreme : most pharmacies ( virtually all in bucharest ) are owned by some large foreign-owned corporations . 
  prices are n't lower , since these companies seem to have some kinds of cartel deals . 
  yup , russia and ukraine are the main buyers of belarusian industrial goods . 
  also , cheap natural gas from russia helps . 
  economically , the decline was not just in a year , it took a few years for romania to lose 40 % of its gdp . 
  gdp per capita ( real 1990 dollars ) : * 1989 : $ 3941 * 1990 : $ 3511 * 1991 : $ 3065 * 1992 : $ 2803, 
  in belarus they did n't close down the old soviet industry . 
  and in 1990 , romania was far poorer than ukraine ; actually , it was poorer than any soviet union republic . 
  from the article :  `` once-itinerant roma who have struck it rich since the fall of communism by stripping defunct factories of their metals and selling them on . '', 
  it 's not saying whether it was legal or not . 
  there 's often a `` hierarchy '' . 
  giving money to beggars does n't help them because they get only a small part . 
  while the bulk gets to finance someone 's luxury , the poor soul standing in the street in the rain will get next to nothing from it . 
  it 's better to give them food , pieces of clothing or other objects they can use personally . 
  if there is a child involved , maybe you can call the local child protection agency , which might help them . 
  sometimes , the beggars are there against their will , but they 're afraid to call the authorities ( racism and xenophobia from the police helps to keep the status quo ) and they know that if they run away , they could be caught and beaten . 
   the projects were approved . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  ok , do you have any reference for that , or are you making it up ? 
  i know that some of the people who got their palaces there were arrested and convicted for that . 
  i live here and i know that stealing anything ( particularly anything of metal ) is a national sport in romania . 
  every week i hear they steal railroad equipment to sell it to scrap . 
  they steal mancovers from bucharest . 
  they steal metal pipes : petrom now uses plastic pipes for transporting oil , leading to soil contamination throughout the forest : but that 's ok , because the state or the people do n't care . 
  they 've stolen the freaking phone cable near my mother 's house five times the last couple of years . 
  no one gave away the factories . 
  they were not privatized , they were simply closed down . 
  * the local police and politicians were bribed to look the other way * the locals ( who were just made unemployed by the closing of the factories ) were busy trying to survive , they did n't care about what happened there . 
  * central-level politicians were busy stealing other more valuable things . 
   got rich completely legitimately selling scrap metal from abandoned factories got rich by selling ** stolen ** metal from abandoned factories . 
  the factories , even if closed , were still owned by the state . 
  of course , virtually everyone who got rich in eastern europe in the last 25 years got rich by stealing from the state , it 's just that the roma show off their wealth . 
  actually , many of the roma of buzescu got rich by dealing iron scrap . 
  after the 1989 revolution almost all the industry romania had been closed down , mostly due to defective management and corruption . 
  some had antiquated technology , but even the factories which had modern technology ( for instance , some even had equipment imported from japan during the late 1980s ) were closed down , so it did n't matter . 
  corruption and incompetence can ruin everything .
