  anyway , returning to the closed factories : many people ( particularly roma , but not only them ) stole everything made from metal from the old factories and sold it for scrap ; some of them even became iron scrap wholesale dealers . 
  at one time , iron scrap was one of top romania 's exports . 
  -- it was only after there was nothing left to steal from the old state-owned factories that they began entering `` new markets '' : begging , prostitution and such . 
  so you really think that building additional pipe capacity from libya to poland is a solution ? 
  that 'd be awfully expensive and i doubt that russia will be as unstable as north africa . 
  many african nations are unstable due to civil wars , tribal warfare and lack of authority of the governments . 
  what made russia a preferred partner for the eu is simply the fact that there are pipes coming from russia . 
  the us produces a lot of gas , but there is no pipe to europe . 
  you are correct . 
  however , that 's the case for economies that are based on production or on services . 
  russia is `` lucky '' because it does n't produce much : its economy is based on the extraction and export of natural resources ( oil , gas , metals , wood , etc ) . 
  [ see graph of exports ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/russia_product_export_treemap.jpg ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that they want an annexation to hungary , not autonomy . 
  the locals ( who are generally much more moderate ) want some kind of autonomy . 
  fascist idiots ( jobbik , `` right '' ) from hungary come to romania to celebrate the hungarian national day by getting into a fight with romanian fascist idiots ( noua dreapt\u0103 , `` the new right '' ) . 
  indeed . 
  quite a lot of chernozems are also in romania , hungary and moldova . 
  i never realized the big differences between different kinds of soils until i saw what soil they have in spain ( calcisol ) : it 's so red it looks as if it 's from mars . 
  let 's call it volcanoland !, 
  well , it 's worded that way so that if they get a `` no '' result , they could try again another referendum later , until they get a `` yes '' . 
  well , i was talking about the english-language media . 
  in the continental eu , there was no point for the media to spew propaganda since most countries did n't participate in the invasion . 
  the us invasions were overwhelmingly supported by the press during the early phase . 
  just read the articles in new york times and other mainstream american newspapers . 
  the tv news was even worse . 
  after a while , they became more balanced and they criticized it , but that was * after the fact * . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_coverage_of_the_iraq_war#criticisms_of_pro-invasion_bias ) :  in 2003 , a study released by fairness and accuracy in reporting stated the network news disproportionately focused on pro-war sources and left out many anti-war sources . 
  according to the study , 64 % of total sources were in favor of the iraq war while total anti-war sources made up 10 % of the media ( only 3 % of us sources were anti-war ) . 
  the study stated that `` viewers were more than six times as likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war ; with u.s. guests alone , the ratio increases to 25 to 1 . 
  actually , it 's the blubber ( whale fat ) which is rich in vitamin d . the inuits make a blubber and whale skin dish called [ muktuk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muktuk ) . 
   it 's like everyone 's trying to make russia the bad guy here for some good old fashioned conquering i 'm not defending russia , it 's obvious that what they 're doing is the politics of old-fashioned imperialism . 
  but it seems so hypocritical when the press is so critical of this kind of imperialism , but is oblivious of the other kinds of imperialism . 
  the same newspapers which were the hawks about the invasion of iraq are now strongly opinioned against russia , talking about the legality of russia 's intervention and how russia violated the sovereignty of ukraine . 
  guess what : the united states violated the sovereignty of iraq , too and the [ legality of the iraq war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_the_iraq_war ) is a very murky subject . 
  and how do you know that some of those ukrainians and tatars do n't want unification with russia ? 
  not everyone is a patriot . 
  for some people , particularly in poor regions with less strong national identity ( such as crimea ) , the standard of living and incomes matter more than their national allegiance . 
  if it becomes part of russia , the wages of public servants , teachers , etc. 
  will raise 3-4 times . 
  for that kind of an income increase , some people emigrate to other countries . 
  why does the english-language press always shows only one side of the conflict ? 
  everything the russians do is bad and all articles try to say this . 
  during the last two weeks , russia has tried hard to swing the crimean tatars towards their side . 
  putin discussed with mustafa dzhemilev , a leader of the crimean tatars and these were the changes so far : * the crimean parliament made tatar language an official language of crimea [ link ] ( http://rt.com/news/crimea-tatar-rights-guarantee-122/ ) * tatars are now guaranteed in the crimean parliament and other offices a greater representation than their percentage in the population [ link ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/723250 ) ( the discussion seems to give them a 20 % representation , whereas they have only 12 % of the population ) * recognition of the local tatar representative body ( the kurultai ) * all kinds of small `` cultural issues '' , like reverting the names of rivers and mountains changed during stalin in the 1940s to their original turkic names . 
  i 'm not saying that these have any meaning other than russian propaganda and some tatars claim that the russians are just trying to bribe them so they would vote for independence . 
  but if you 're the press , just show all the points of view ; otherwise you 're not the press , you 're the propaganda office . 
  that seems to be a common feature of all european left-wing parties . 
  military spending for nato members is pointless because there wo n't be any conventional war against russia involving nato . 
  any war involving nato and russia would be a nuclear holocaust . 
  so the russians should have mimicked some ethnic cleansing first ? 
  then there was fraud : b\u0103sescu 's party got more votes from fraud from abroad , while the social-democrats focused on fraud at home . 
  likely they would have imposed some austerity , probably less harsh . 
  anyway , it 's pointless to argue what ifs . 
  in romania , the presidential elections of 2009 were decided by voters from abroad . 
  the people living in romania voted mostly the left-wing candidate , but the romanian citizens living abroad ( western europe , america and moldova ) voted overwhelmingly right-wing , shifting the balance towards traian b\u0103sescu , who was able to secure a majority in parliament and impose some harsh austerity measures on romania . 
  of course , the people who tilted the balance towards him thought they did the good thing , that they `` defeated the communists '' . 
  but mr. b\u0103sescu was also a former member and official of the communist party , too , but he * speaks out * against communism . 
  the problem is that ukraine did n't kick them out of the power . 
  the new ones are just as corrupt as the old ones . 
  in romania , we had a turnout of 27 % in 2009 . 
  do n't worry : when there 's vote fraud , everything is possible . 
  * as elsewhere , there are quite a few dead people on the voting registry . 
  the difference is that in romania , the dead actually vote . 
  * people who live abroad also appear as they have voted back home * then there are people who vote multiple times : people who are not on the voting registry have been allowed to vote on `` supplementary lists '' . 
  all major parties organize their own `` electoral tourism '' : they hire buses full of people who go and vote multiple times , going from village to village and voting in each of them . 
  vice-prime minister dragnea ( from the social-democrats ) has been charged with co-ordinating vote fraud , but the trial is going slowly , which means that it 'll take a few years before he 's going to prison . 
  obviously , the current political class does n't want anything to change . 
  the only solution would be a european directive defining the limits for what a free and fair election means . 
  in romania , i 've heard these remarks from noua dreapt\u0103 , a group affiliated at the same `` nationalist international '' with `` svoboda '' . 
  it 's funny how they have these nationalist internationals because their nationalism is obviously opposed one to the other . 
  svoboda wanted to remove rights for minorities in ukraine ( including the romanian minority ) , leading to criticism from noua dreapt\u0103 in romania . 
  in the same time , noua dreapt\u0103 opposes minority rights for hungarians in romania and obviously the hungarian party jobbik does n't like that . 
  i 'm surprised they do n't get into fist fights at their european meetings . 
  many nationalist groups in europe claim they `` do n't believe '' in western democracy . 
  the most common reason for that is that they claim that the media is owned by the jews ( depending on the case , american or russian jews ) . 
  i 'm not voting . 
  the electoral system in romania is made in such a way to prevent any alternative from the corrupt mainstream parties . 
  ** registering a party ** requires 25.000 signatures from across the country ( there is a minimum number of signatures from at least 20 counties ) . 
  you have to pay a `` guarantee '' ( more than half a million euros ) per election . 
  if you do n't get any seats , you lose it . 
  if you do n't get enough votes for two consecutive elections , the party is automatically disbanded . 
  the number of signatures for registering a party is higher than every other country in europe . 
  for instance , in the uk it 's as easy as paying a # 150 fee . 
  even putin 's russia makes it easier to register a party !, 
  ** registering an independent candidate ** for european parliament elections in romania requires 100.000 signatures . 
  other countries which allow independent candidates for european parliament elections ( many do not , but that 's a different thing ) require far fewer signatures for the same election : * malta : 4 [osce.org ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680 ) * ireland : 60 [ europarl.ie ] ( http://www.europarl.ie/en/european_elections_/european_elections_1/candidates.html ) * luxemburg : 250 [osce.org ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680 ) * austria : 2.600 [osce.org ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680 ) * slovenia : 3.000 [osce.org ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680 ) * belgium : 5.000 [ uni-mannheim . de ] ( http://www.pedz.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-ma/ep/09/est24511.pdf ) * spain : 15.000 [osce.org ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680 ) ** the media ** tends to be affiliated with one party or another . 
  sometimes , the owner is the leader of a party , using the tv stations and newspapers as propaganda machines . 
  even if you have some popularity , the media will simply ignore you . 
  they 'll pretend you do n't exist , or , if they do present you , they 'll do it derisively . 
  basically , if you want to participate in the elections in romania , you need lots of money and the only people who have the money are the local oligarchs and corrupt politicians and their family . 
  -- ** edit ** : the mainstream parties tend to nominate the relatives of the leaders and other idiots . 
  if you live in romania , then you must update your registered address ( the one on your id card ) if it 's no longer valid . 
  if you live at the address on your id card , then you need to do nothing . 
  there is a world market for food . 
  they can simply buy food from south america . 
   romania will probably do it as well , plus there are some very tempting economic prospects . 
  there are no tempting economic prospects . 
  we 'll get 5 % in royalties , another 10 % in wages/labour and the oil companies will keep 85 % . 
  that 's because you were francophile back in the 19th century . 
  ukrainians are kinda bankrupt right now , so i do n't think they 'll get any money from them .
