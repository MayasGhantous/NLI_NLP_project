  in other words , the transnistrian authorities want more money from russia . 
   the jews are the most hateful and racist people in the world using a stereotype for a whole ethnicity is racist !, 
  imprisoning journalists is fair game . 
  or that there are many tourists from outside russia ? 
  also , it 's hypocrisy and possibly xenophobia . 
  ibm sold punch-card equipment and provided services to nazi germany to help rounding up the jews in germany and the occupied territory , as well as for managing millions of inmates in concentration camps . 
  see [ ibm and the holocaust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibm_and_the_holocaust ) . 
  if ibm were to build a subsidised factory in maryland , i 'm pretty sure that the maryland legislature would n't say a word , but since sncf is a french , not an american company , it 's a different thing . 
  but the economic ties are closer now :  [ from the eu ] ( http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/cuba/eu_cuba/political_relations/index_en.htm ) :   the eu is cuba 's second largest trading partner ( 19.4 % ) after venezuela ( 24.9 % ) . 
  more precisely , the eu is cuba 's second export partner ( 19 % - beverages and tobacco , food and live animal , mineral fuels , crude material including nickel ) after venezuela ( 30.6 % ) and is its second import partner ( 20.7 % - machinery and transport equipment , manufactured goods , chemicals and related products , food and live animals , etc ) after china . 
    the eu is cuba 's first investor and approximately one third of all tourists visiting the island every year come from the eu . 
  so 3000 dead in 4 years in a region with 5 million people is a good job ? 
   boycotting that referendum is a move i can not understand . 
  the tatars are too few ( 12 % ) to be able to change the result of the referendum , so , from their point of view , there 's no reason to try to vote . 
  so the russians are not actually occupier , but they are on a humanitary mission to bring freedom to the chechens ? 
   chechen people live in their fatherland for centuries . 
  majority of crimean population was brought there by stalin from russia in modern politics , the argument `` we were here first '' does n't matter . 
  the only thing that matters ( apart from brute force ) is who lives there now . 
  many guerrilla groups have/had an ideology apart from `` national liberation '' , for instance communism/anti-communism ( latin america ) , maoism ( india ) , islamism ( middle east ) , etc. 
  but the main reason why they are attracted is not religion , but the idea of `` freedom '' . 
   where did you get that idea ? 
  chechnya loves russia right now . 
  so the current guerrilla uprising is a * love guerrilla * ? 
  [ since 2009 , there have been at least ** 3000 people killed in guerrilla fightings ** in north caucasus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insurgency_in_the_north_caucasus ) . 
  ( official figures ) people who are content with their government do n't take up arms to fight against it . 
  i did n't say that putin needed or even requested the falsifications . 
  he 's genuinely popular in russia , but in chechnya it is a very different story . 
  the local authorities are * very * authoritarian and they control everything , presumably to prevent further fightings . 
  the falsifications are simply there to show putin how loyal they are to him . 
   because right now ~ ~ chechnya ~ ~ ** the chechen government ** is incredibly supportive of the russian government . 
  ftfy . 
  chechnya is far more repressed and less democratic than even the rest of russia , so you do n't know what the chechens think . 
   99 % of chechnyans voted putin in the last elections . 
  they love putin so much that in some parts of chechnya , 117 % of the people showed up to vote and 99 % of them voted for putin . 
  well , the netherlands belonged to spain just like the chechnya belonged to the ottoman empire , but the french could take over just like the russians did . 
   chechen -- russian conflict , 1785 -- present that 's sad . 
  why on earth would the netherlands want independence ? 
  it would make more sense to be a province of france . 
  in case you 're interested why they hate russia , you have to read about the massacres and deportation of all the chechens to siberia during stalin . 
  [ the eu recognizes this as a genocide ] ( http://www.unpo.org/article/438 ) . 
   the eu officially suspended relations with cuba , governed by the americas ' only one-party communist regime , in 2003 over the jailing of dozens of cuban dissidents . 
  [ ... ] but starting in 2005 , those sanctions were gradually lifted as the government opponents were released in the meantime , the eu never had any problems having relations with china , which still has thousands of jailed dissidents . 
  actually , what matters is the [ employment-to-population ratio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/employment-to-population_ratio ) and norway is the third in the world , only iceland and switzerland having better ratios . 
  chemical industry . 
   our labour costs are 60 % higher than the eu average . 
  that 's because you do n't have enough workers . 
  a 3 % unemployment rate is ridiculously low for european standards . 
   when the oil will run out , things will adjust themselves quickly , if you 're going to have a sound monetary policy . 
  because you should only read your own government 's propaganda , not the other country 's propaganda . 
  otherwise , you might realize that there is no good side to the conflict . 
  the foreign minister does not give a verdict . 
  he only says what 's the word on the street in kiev and he thinks they might have a point because the government refused to do a proper investigation of the over 100 deaths by snipers . 
   also , men probably experience 100 % physical violence during highschool . 
  i did n't experience any physical violence during highschool . 
  have i missed anything ? 
   `` inappropriate invitations to go out on a date '' as a case for sexual harassment . 
  i bet in southern europe there are fewer cases of `` inappropriate invitations '' than in the north simply because there are different standards of what 's inappropriate . 
  this was a result of the french revolution , as its leaders thought that the `` patois '' ( local dialects ) helped the royalty and aristocracy to prevent the common people from gaining any political power . 
  so the spread of standard french was considered linked to the spread of political power , since all national political debate was done in french . 
  indeed , what we need now is a nuclear war !, 
  definitely not `` the brits '' and not even all tories . 
   he was apparently severely mentally ill . 
  he was mentally ill , but he was able to live on his own , provided that he had enough money . 
  i do n't think in such cases ( in which they 're not a danger to the society and they can live on their own ) they should be guarded 24h . 
  romania ? 
  because our leaders are used to do what they 're told to . 
  poland ? 
  because they hate russia , so they 'll do whatever the us tells them . 
  this law affects more than 10 million people : * 8,334,141 russians * 409,608 romanians * 275,763 belarusians * 248,193 crimean tatars * 204,574 bulgarians * 156,566 hungarians * 144,130 poles,

  he must have sat on the router . 
  we know of at least four places : guantanamo , poland , romania and iraq ( abu ghraib ) . 
  some politicians said the same thing was said here in romania , but nothing was ever proven . 
  the anti-shale gas movement was mostly grassroot , with some small ongs running on a shoestring budget , some organic farmers and the local peasants . 
   remember many people living in crimea are legitimately ethnically russian . 
  actually , most people in crimea are ethnically russian . 
  it 's most likely that the russian state wo n't interfere directly in ukraine , so they wo n't break the memorandum . 
  the outcome will be that local militias will declare crimea 's independence following a referendum that is not recognized by kiev . 
  europeans are people who were born and live in europe , regardless of ancestry or race . 
    most europeans are considered the same race . 
    most ? 
  and which are not ? 
  for instance , europeans whose ancestors were 20th century immigrants from sub-sarahan africa . 
  well , i 'm a programmer living in eastern europe . 
  the average after-tax wage is 350 $ / month . 
  a programmer can get an after-tax income of 1500-2000 $ / month or more . 
  in romania , voter registration is resident registration . 
  you need to register your residence by march 25 in order to be allowed to vote . 
  i think you misread his message . 
  he said that / r/europe is too busy talking about gay marriage and weed instead of looking into the economic issues , of which the neoliberalism is a cause . 
  you must remember that you 're comparing ukraine ( where poverty is rampant ) with russia ( which , mainly due to its resources , is doing quite a lot better ) . 
  why would anyone be insulted by this ? 
   there is bulgaria as another example well , bulgaria did ship to auschwitz the jews from the conquered territories ( macedonia ) , it only saved the jews from its own territory . 
  of course real humanitarian assistance ( in healthcare , education , building some minimal infrastructure ) can help tremendously and it does work , even with rather little money . 
  but even more money in given in non-humanitarian aid , such as `` military aid '' . 
  the egyptian military received billions upon billions of dollars . 
  colombia and mexico get lots of money for `` fighting cartels '' , which , together with money from illegal drug trade , are fueling the civil wars in there .
