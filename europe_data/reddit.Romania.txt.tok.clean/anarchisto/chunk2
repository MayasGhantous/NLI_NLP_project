  * in 2009 , 12 % of romanians did n't have access to safe drinking water . 
  ( more than in countries like india and nepal ) [ source : who ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/mar/03/access-water ) * about two-thirds of romanians living in rural areas ( which make up roughly half of the population ) do n't have access to municipal/centralized water supply , relying on ( often-polluted ) shallow wells [ source ] ( http://www.justadrop.org/our-work/europe/romania/ ) * 40.7 % of romanian homes do n't have indoor plumbing . 
  ( eurostat ) * 41 % of romanians are classified by the eu as `` at risk for poverty '' , while 29 % face `` severe material deprivations '' ( eurostat ) * 9,8 % of women and 14 % of men have `` limited access to healthcare '' due to high costs or lack of any hospitals nearby * infant mortality is more than double the average in the eu . 
  i do n't think it 's relevant . 
  they are romanian citizens . 
  you can find a similar level of poverty among the ethnic romanians , especially in isolated villages ( and particularly in the moldavia region of eastern romania ) , the difference being that usually they have fewer children . 
  yes , it 's a village with a roma majority . 
  the article was published in september 2014 , but i can see that the photo filenames have the date november 2013 .

  the village is [ hetea , covasna county ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/place/hetea+527178/@46.7025131,24.2750904,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x40b4a675c142ed57:0x3cbe3df4d97e4fd3?hl=ro ) , near the city of bra\u0219ov in transylvania , central romania . 
  it 's a tradition : emil constantinescu ( former president ) said a while ago about traian b\u0103sescu ( the current president ) that he 's an undercover officer , too . 
  hungarian borrowed the word from romanian * p\u0103stor * , which is cognate to the spanish word .

  secular jews generally do n't care . 
  about half of israelis consider themselves not religious . 
  during the 1960s and early 1970s , yes , he was very popular . 
  life was good , romania became independent of the soviet union . 
  during the 1980s , he was hated by everyone . 
  austerity , shortages , international isolation . 
  after 1989 , he started to be popular again because of the economic disaster and corruption of our politicians . 
  [ romania can into nordic , too !,

  unfortunately , most eastern europeans want to be `` rich like the west '' , not to have western values . 
  most eastern european countries do n't have open societies . 
  they 're quite nationalist and full of prejudice . 
  just ask any eastern european what they think about roma people ( who have been living here for several hundreds of years ) . 
   there is a great difference in the east european `` brain drain '' , they can freely go back after they have studied etc in the western part . 
  no , they do n't want to go back . 
  more than half of the people in my university class ( software engineering , bucharest polytechnic ) have left the country without any intent to ever return . 
  most popular places are the us , uk , germany , france , switzerland . 
  people who study abroad do n't return here . 
  and that includes both the former ministers and the microsoft executives . 
  according to the [ rsf press freedom report ] ( http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php# ) , romania is just above the united states . 
   i just do n't understand , if gdp per capita is almost the same as greece , how can their average pensions be higher than our average salary ? 
  in western european countries , the sum of all wages ( and obviously , pensions ) represent a higher percentage of the gdp than in eastern europe . 
  fbroe -- former british republic of england, 
   eastern europeans are n't poor they just have unexploited potential ( because of communism )  the east/west divide is older than this . 
  if we look at the 1930 gdp/capita map , it 's pretty much similar to this one . 
  [ there 's a nationwide debate about that ] ( http://forward.com/articles/161262/tolerant-denmark-debates-circumcision-ban/?p=all ) and [ israel does n't like it ] ( http://cphpost.dk/news/circumcision-divide-between-denmark-and-israel.8440.html ) . 
  in italy , i 've seen 0.66 l bottles . 
  that 's what czechoslovakian politicians did . 
  i wonder how many of those students studying abroad actually hook up with people from their own regions : scandinavians , eastern europeans , southern europeans , etc. 
  when talking , i feel closer to a czech , hungarian , bulgarian or croat than to a western european . 
  i do n't know why . 
   will start having issues due to the cultural differences imo , the personality differences are far more dramatic than cultural differences . 
  in romania , all churches get funding from the government , proportional to the percentage of members from the last census . 
  clergy 's and other church employees ' salaries are paid from the state budget . 
  many cities and commune also give a lot of money to their local churches . 
  these sums are quite high sometimes . 
  the orthodox church is now building a mega-cathedral using money it gets from the state and several hectares of very expensive land in downtown bucharest . 
  in all , this would cost the state several hundreds of millions of euros . 
  it does n't matter i 'm an atheist , my tax money still goes to fund church activities . 
  -- in the meantime , the social security net is virtually non-existing . 
  the government does n't care . 
  last week 's local activist `` news '' in bucharest was that social activists were trying to find places to stay for the squatters of roma ethnicity who were just evicted by police . 
  they 'll probably end up going in western europe to join the other romanian homeless there . 
  then they 're no longer going to be our problem . 
  who reads press releases ? 
  videos are better at spreading this kind of information . 
  so you think it 's a normal thing to lie and make false promises ? 
  they even signed a pledge about giving more powers to scotland . 
  well , it 's because of this kind of politicking from the westminster politicians that almost half of scots voted for independence . 
  if they keep the same style of politics , in a decade there will be another referendum , but this time successful . 
  well , he admitted the defeat and he did resign . 
  what he means by `` tricked '' is the fact that the westminster parties ( tories and labour ) promised the scots more powers before the referendum , but right after the referendum they began to back off saying they no longer support more devolution . 
  for instance , [ miliband signed a pledge for more powers to scotland if the `` no '' wins ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/david-cameron-nick-clegg-and-ed-miliband-sign-extra-powers-pledge.1410822585 ) , but after it , [ the same miliband said there are `` more important things than devo max '' ] ( https://uk.news.yahoo.com/brown-sets-vision-scotlands-future-091455475.html ) . 
  this attitude of london politicians led to [ some `` no voters '' to express regret over their vote . 
  yeah , because they used to say that `` the solution to pollution is dilution '' . 
  why not before the 1980s ? 
  because between the 1950s-1970s the priority was to develop the country at any cost , chinese-style ( and we did have for some years the highest economic growth in the world ) . 
  during the 1990s , romania 's economy was in a freefall , resulting in more than half of romanians being in deep poverty . 
  when you are unemployed and you have trouble getting enough food for your family , ecology is not an important thing to worry . 
  the government did n't care about anything other than getting themselves rich . 
  i 've seen rainwater drains being spilled directly into the sea in greece . 
  they 're probably not a very good idea because they spill a lot of rubbish into the sea . 
  these rainwater drains are usually open sewers which get full of rubbish which gets once in a while cleaned by the rain ... 
  well , the building of that sewage treatment plant started during the 1980s , but after ceau\u0219escu fell , it was stopped , like virtually everything the state did . 
  once in a while the press did report about the `` lifeless river '' downstream of bucharest , with biologists talking about how only bacteria and nematodes could live in it . 
  only when we joined the eu someone took a look at this . 
  it does n't look like raw sewage . 
  sewage tends to be more brownish . 
  maybe we should ask the local authorities and/or local tourism authorities ? 
   this would n't happen in my country this would happen in my country . 
  many cities still do n't have sewage treatment plants . 
  bucharest did n't do any sewage treatment until a couple of years ago . 
  it just dumped everything in a river which then flowed into the danube . 
  now the sewage treatment plant is under construction ( half of it being paid by eu funds ) and , as of today , more than half of the sewage is being treated . 
  the old people do n't base their opinion on economic realism , but on wwii and post-war british solidarity , which is pretty much gone . 
  they have an active and slightly terrorist national liberation front of corsica . 
  it has little to do with putin , it has to do with the anti-progressive stance of the orthodox church . 
  this is valid for greek and romanian orthodox churches , which are not pro-putin . 
  that 's a techno music parade and party . 
  people go there to find someone with whom to get laid . 
  i 'm pretty sure that every other parade is a heterosexual parade . 
  we have in romania [ on the seaside a techno music lovers ' parade called `` liberty parade '' . 
  ] ( http://www.radio21.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/liberty-parade2013_01.jpg ), 
   i do n't support lgbt parades in belgrade because it 's not safe for the people go out with your friends and make it safe for those people !, 
  during this year 's lgbt parade in bucharest there were more straight supporters of gays ' rights than actual gays . 
   i 'm afraid if they split it in two it will become much poorer sweden , denmark , norway and finland used to be unified , one way or the other . 
  they split into smaller countries and , yet , they 're not poor .
