  officials in bucharest say that christmas pigs are killed around the feast of st ignatius , on december 20th . 
  they may be sprinkled with holy water . 
  adults watching the slaughter will traditionally be fasting , and will not eat the festive dishes derived from the pig ( jellied bits of head , pork cabbage rolls with polenta , blood sausages and so on ) until christmas eve . 
  some village schools give pupils the day off for the pig killing , and children are fed singed bits of skin to cheer them up . 
  `` the children will cry for the pig , because it has been their friend for a year , '' admits niculae lazar , a government vet . 
  but backyard pigs lead better lives than industrial farm animals , he adds . 
  [ or , another description from czech republic ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/pig-slaughtering-feasts-on-their-way-out ) :  a pig-slaughtering feast is precisely what the name suggests -- the slaughter of a pig out in the open by a master butcher , the processing of the meat and intestines in front of those invited and subsequently a boisterous pork feast accompanied by drinking , music and dancing which generally leaves everyone much the worse for wear . 
   ca n't there be a singleissue party the mainstream press is owned by the leaders of the mainstream parties or their associates . 
  they 'll simply ignore your little party . 
  without any media coverage , you 're not going to win . 
  everyone knows that corruption is by far the worst problem in both southern and eastern europe . 
  ( for [ corruption in romania , see this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qr6u2/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_bulgaria_is/cdfmv2q?context=3 ) ) but what can we do ? 
  * regular democratic process means replacing a corrupt party/alliance with an equally corrupt party . 
  * better and more independent justice might make us feel good when a politician or a dozen , or a hundred get behind bars , but it changes nothing . 
  in romania , we had a prime-minister , a dozen ministers , dozens of mayors , more than a dozen mps convicted of corruption , but the system is continuing as before . 
  if anything , things are getting worse , not better . 
  we need new people , people who are idealistic , who are not driven by money , people unlike all office-holders we have . 
   general lack of a true sentiment of unity across the continent `` so you hate the us ? 
  so hate them , too !, 
  we have so many things in common ! '', 
  there 's another story like that in romania : during the 1930s , nae ionescu , a fascist christian orthodox philosopher was invited to dinner by romanian orthodox patriarch miron cristea . 
  although it was during lent , they were served turkey . 
  ionescu was outraged by this and wrote an angry newspaper article about this . 
  patriarch cristea responded by asking the painter who was painting the patriarchal cathedral in bucharest to put ionescu 's face on a devil . 
  ** democracy ** -- the institution which has the real power should be democratically elected , not appointed by national governments like the european commission . 
  ** financial union ** -- if you have a common currency , in order to work , you need to get a financial union first . 
  otherwise the poor countries will get poorer ( greece ) and the rich will get richer ( germany ) . 
  ** bureaucracy ** -- do n't make the rules for the common market be too complicated , or you 'd need a huge pointless bureaucracy to run it . 
  do n't allow individual countries to write their own exceptions and exceptions to exceptions . 
  ** do it for the people ** -- if the whole process goes like in the eu , then you 'd end up with a set of rules written by the large corporations . 
  i know it might seem obvious , but in the fundamental legislation you should enshrine the rights for the people , not for the big corporations . 
  ** have one voice ** -- the eu almost never has an opinion about anything . 
  there is no single voice of the eu and this is why it does n't matter as an institution in the world affairs . 
  of course , we could have called ourselves dacians ( just like the belgians , spaniards and italians are called after the ancient regions ) , but now it 's a bit too late for that . 
   i find this confusion disparaging ... roma / romanian . 
  the word `` roma/romanies '' predates `` romanian '' in english . 
  ( they first reached england quite a few centuries ago )  to my surprise the word manus means man in the `` romani language '' what is this bullshit ? 
  languages can have more than word to refer to the same concept . 
  for instance , in english , there is both `` man '' and `` human '' . 
  there 's no `` gypsy conspiracy '' to take over the name of the romanians . 
  well , not fully `` socialist '' ( as in eastern europe ) , but a country with many socialist features . 
  for instance , the state is far more present in the economy than in the more `` economically liberal '' countries . 
  the only two european countries which require visas for eu citizens are russia and belarus . 
  the other way around , for visiting the schengen countries , citizens of russia , belarus , ukraine , kosovo and moldova need visas . 
  the uk also requires visas for citizens of bosnia , macedonia , serbia and albania . 
  well , the accordion guy is a self-employed person . 
  socialism should theoretically support ideas such as `` all humans are equal '' . 
  we had probably ~ 50 politicians convicted during the last few years , including a prime minister ( n\u0103stase , two convictions ) , several former ministers ( babiuc , fenechiu , reme\u0219 , mure\u015fan , copos , ridzi , chiuariu , nagy etc. ), 
  and mps and mayors too many to mention them . 
  however , nothing changed on the corruption front : our politicians are just as corrupt as they ever were . 
  public works contracts are always , without exception , still given in exchange for bribes . 
  artisanal brands of olive oil ( of any country ) are definitely better , but the brands from italy , greece or spain you find in regular supermarkets outside their home countries are quite bad . 
  christian ^ * morality : movies about explicit murders and killings full of gore are ok . movies about explicit sex are not ok . ^ ^ * ^ ( not all christians , but certainly the american protestants and eastern orthodoxy . ), 
  however , it seems the movie is quite bad , but from reasons unrelated to the explicit sex scenes . 
   well fuck italian olive oil then unfortunately , olive oil from other countries can be adulterated as well . 
  from my experience , particularly olive oil from greece . 
  moldavia is a region that is now divided between romania , moldova and ukraine . 
  the `` core '' of the region ( including its former capitals and the river that gave its name ) is in romania . 
  ** romania ** : * moldavia : poor , dirty , drink too much , but cheerful , welcoming and emotional * transylvania : calm , slow in thinking and acting , but dilligent and hard-working * oltenia : they have a very good opinion about their intellect ; they find ingenious solutions ( but which always fail ) , particularly in order to avoid work ; they want to be bosses * banat : they think they are `` the best '' romanians in anything they do * bucharest : cosmopolite smartasses , they think that everyone outside of bucharest is a peasant . 
  * hungarians are seen as very proud , but naive . 
  the sums they would get are ridiculously low compared with their total debt . 
  ( which is  2 trillion $ ), 
   why is greece so adverse to finding a solution to the name ? 
  because they 're stubborn nationalists . 
  or catalunya , because independance * will * go through, 
  why people think it 's a good idea of selling monopolies , such as the air traffic controller ? 
  actually , they personalize results based on region as well , so the order might be different for different countries . 
  the czech republic is probably atheist because it was the european country most affected by religious strife . 
  for instance : * the pope organized five crusades against the followers of bohemian religious reformer jan hus ( known as the `` hussite wars '' , 1419-1434 ) * the thirty years ' war ( 1618 -- 1648 ) decreased the population of bohemia and moravia ( which form today 's czech republic ) by more than a third due to famine , warfare and expulsion of protestants . 
  after the * foreign * catholics won and forcefully converted the czechs back to catholicism , the national struggle was interwined with anti-catholicism . 
  as the hussite religion was dead and there was no local `` native '' church ( as it was in transylvania , for instance ) , anti-catholicism led to irreligion . 
  at least in kiev , it 's the people vs. the government . 
  well , they recognize it as a county , not as a country . 
  [ one day , this sign in london ( now only in romanian ) will be bilingual romanian-serbian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cvfgnov.jpg ) . 
  the sign is warning pickpockets by saying that `` civil-dressed police officers operate in this area '' . 
  so that 's why there 's so much strife in the middle east : not enough bacon !, 
  if we could only convince the arabs and israelis to eat bacon instead of fighting ... 
  they export each part of the pig to the market that is paying the most : which means that the bacon goes to britain , the feet go to china , etc , while the parts that no one wants become sausages . 
  yes , it can pay more , but the politicians do n't care about their salaries or the quality of medical services . 
  they do n't use the romanian healthcare anyway . 
  if they have any health issue , they take the next flight to vienna . 
  this was valid even for our president , who had his surgery in vienna . 
  the politicians however want the money they manage to be funneled towards their pockets . 
  there have been hundreds of people investigated , dozens of politicians sentenced to jail , but that did n't change one thing . 
   no , he did n't say romanians he said roma referring to gypsies let me quote you : `` people in romania and bulgaria are `` living like animals '' and will want to live in a `` civilised country '' like the uk instead , nigel farage said today . '', 
   right again . 
  and nobody will listen because they 'd rather scream racist . 
  and they would n't be wrong . 
  he is racist and takes any opportunity to insult other ethnic groups . 
  for instance , we , romanians are , according to him , `` uncivilized people '' who `` live like animals '' . 
  he also brings stereotypes in discussions about what he calls `` coloured people '' and he thinks that it is impossible for pakistani pupils to `` rise to the top '' . 
  public illumination in rural areas , in some cases road and highway illumination . 
  at least in the case of moldova , it lost half their gdp/capita after the ussr broke . 
  or an even better example , pinochet 's chile , where , despite being very liberal economically , the dictatorship was very tough on dissent . 
  of course , which is what i said , pure statistics do n't show the entire picture . 
  statistics often do n't show the whole picture . 
  in north korea , they do n't eat too much , there 's no fast food , no processed foods , almost no obesity ( except for the obese-in-chief ) and they eat little meat , so theoretically , they eat healthy . 
  what surprised me about the us was how many restaurants actually belonged to huge corporations who own hundreds , sometimes thousands of them . 
  i went to a diner which , due to the american pop culture , seemed familiar . 
  but a few blocks away , there was another diner , which seemed even more familiar : it was the same brand , the same interior decoration style , everything the same .
