  no , italians like small family-owned caf\u00e9s and restaurants . 
  in much of italy , even supermarkets tend to be small local chains , not international ones . 
   you could get around that by making people work for 3 hours a day to pay off said debt . 
  we should hire some chinese experts on forced labour camps to help us set them up . 
  he wanted to rule using the support of the common people , but the common people had no political say at the time . 
  michael , vlad or stephen were great military leaders , but , in the end , it did n't matter . 
  if they had not existed , the course of our history would have gone pretty much the same way . 
  michael 's personal union of wallachia , moldavia and transylvania lasted for a couple of years . 
  after his death , everything reverted to the way things have been before . 
  vlad may have killed a lot of turks ( including some massacres of muslims that would have been considered war crimes nowadays ) , but it 's not like he could have single-handedly defeated the ottoman empire . 
  after his death , wallachia reverted to a vassal . 
  all of stephan 's victories did n't matter , because moldavia became a vassal of the ottomans anyway . 
  alexandru ioan cuza , first prince of romania ( 1859-1866 ) : * made the union of wallachia and moldavia into romania by being named prince of both countries . 
  * obtaining the recognition of the union from the western countries * confiscated all lands owned by the church ( a quarter of all land in romania ) * land reform ( splitting the land of the villages `` owned '' by the boyars between the boyars and peasants ) * corv\u00e9e and all feudal privileges discarded * established first democratic principles in romania * adopted free , universal and mandatory primary education * founded the first two universities in romania ( bucharest and ia\u0219i ) * adopted the napoleonic code ( civil code ) * started the building of the first railroads in romania * modernization of the tax system ... and many other reforms . 
  basically , he took a quasi-feudal country and turned it into a reasonably modern country from a legislative point-of-view . 
  there were fewer reforms in the next 50 years than there were during cuza 's 7 years . 
  he was overthrown by a `` monstrous coalition '' of conservatives and liberals , both of which feared that further reforms might weaken their power and he was replaced by a conservative king from germany . 
   our money is supposedly europe 's dirtiest but i expected [ a cold antiseptic sting from the swiss franc ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sor9gzivgbk ) . 
  * spain gdp ( world bank ) , 2006 : $ 1.236 trillion ; 2006 unemployment : 8 % * spain gdp ( world bank ) , 2012 : $ 1.322 trillion ; 2012 unemployment : 25 % this means that they produce ** more ** with far fewer workers . 
  how do you explain this other than by having better efficiency ? 
  definitely not in china like some people suggest : the chinese workforce is shrinking every year as a side-effect of the one-child policy implemented in 1979 . 
  the simple response is `` automation '' . 
  software is making people more efficient , thus requiring fewer workers . 
  ( the number of jobs in spain has been going down quite fast , while the gdp kept steady ) a better response is `` automation together with really bad public policies '' . 
  and make the fletcher memorial home for incurable tyrants and kings in norway ? 
  other kids also give switzerland their valuables to hold them while they fight . 
  the top of the class are four friends : norway is a rich kid who loves camping . 
  sweden is more sophisticated and thinks everything he does is better than the rest . 
  he might be right . 
  denmark loves partying , but nevertheless studies hard . 
  finland is unlike the others , dark and loves knives , but he still is a nice guy if you come to know him . 
  germany is the class president and he 's an obsessive-compulsive kid . 
  some say that before he moved to this school , he did some unspeakable horrors at his previous school . 
  france is germany 's best friend , she 's very opinionated always has a topic to protest about . 
  italy is a smart kid , but who always acts like a clown , so no one takes him seriously . 
  spain is the lazy kid who falls asleep in class . 
  greece has a lot of trouble in the family , so it 's not surprising that she has such bad grades . 
  she feels she is bullied , particularly by germany , although germany thinks he 's just trying to help . 
  serbia , croatia and bosnia used to inseparable best friends before they got into an ugly fist fight which ended up at the emergency room . 
  hungary is the depressed emo , always remembering about how he used to be the class president together with austria . 
  romania and bulgaria have low grades and some teachers think they 're doing it on purpose , they ca n't be that dumb . 
  then there are the triplets estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  almost no one can tell them apart . 
  estonia tries to become friends with the scandinavians , but they do n't like her that much . 
  britain says he does n't like this school and that she likes her friend usa more . 
  some kids call the usa `` peeping tom '' for spying on them and then sharing what he finds with britain . 
  switzerland is a rich kid who brags about not being in a fight since the second grade . 
  with the three powers combined , they summon earth 's greatest champion -- captain drunkard !, 
   a preliminary counter on the website of the central bank , which manages the fund , rose to 5.11 trillion kroner [ that 's like 10 banknotes such as this one ] ( http://www.rickety.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/500_billion_dinara.jpg ) !, 
  i can guarantee you that a small studio at the periphery of oslo costs a lot more than this . 
  but this is not about the wealth of the people , but the wealth of the state . 
  a comparison would be with your public debt , which is around $ 21,000 / capita . 
  so it 's comparing norway 's +118 k $ with portugal 's -21 k $ . 
  romania # 1 !, 
  that 's probably not 1917 , it 's a aniversary of the 1917 revolution . 
  the pics are probably 1950s or later . 
  and some of pictures show drunk people . 
  so the `` vampires are sexy '' pr campaign of the world vampire council did n't work ? 
  europe is enduring austerity ( which is decreasing its economy due to decreased demand ) , while the us is on a government loaning spree ( hence expanding the economy due to increased demand ) . 
  since 2008 , the us government borrowed and spent $ 7,000 billion . 
  regardless of what some economists and politicians say to you , the only thing that creates jobs is demand . 
  no sane entrepreneur would hire more people unless there is demand for the products . 
  in times of crisis , the easiest way to artificially create demand is through government spending . 
  ... and they wo n't stop as long as the fines they get are smaller than the profits they get from corruption . 
  what they claim that they do n't control the regional managers is obviously bullshit . 
  a top-down `` absolutely no bribing '' policy works . 
  for instance , the [ ericsson scandal ] ( https://reportingproject.net/occrp/index.php/en/ccwatch/cc-watch-indepth/1869-ericsson-accused-of-bribes-by-exec ) , [ siemens/microsoft ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/world/romanian-officials-involved-in-the-microsoft-scandal-there-is-a-conspiracy-planned-by-the-asians-208503.html ) and a plethora of other companies . 
  an argument i keep hearing ( from western europeans , especially from france ) is that the eu makes any reform to the economic systems of its member states impossible and that it forces the states ( through the unelected commission ) to implement little-by-little the neoliberal version of capitalism . 
  their discourse is mostly about how the way the eu is organized decreases the people 's power . 
  -- i can see a similar argument in eastern europe ( for instance , my country ) , too . 
  it 's generally not against capitalism per se ( anticapitalism is still an anathema ) , but rather the way how the western europeans ( governments and companies alike ) do n't see in us partners , they see eastern europe as their colonies . 
  * they get resources almost for free ( usually by bribing our leaders ) * they get workforce for a tenth the price of work in their countries * they buy our factories and then they close them down * unemployment forces us to go to work abroad and then their press call us the scum of the earth * their companies bribe our leaders and then they say it 's our fault because we 're corrupt ( it feels like the john chiding a prostitute for being immoral ) i never see opposition against the concept of a european union , but mostly against the way it is currently organized . 
   the neo-communists currently in power in romania calling them `` neo-communists '' is absurd . 
  i know you 're using it as an insult , but privatizing everything , natural resources , energy , hydro plants , public utilities , whatever industry still stands , healthcare , etc. 
  is definitely not `` communist '' . 
  i 'm sure there are monarchists who argue that the royal family is a good deal because the politicians steal billions . 
  a conspiracy theorist might say that it 's a conspiracy to destroy the last bastions of social democracy . 
    i have huge respect for king juan carlos . 
    why ? 
  he 's a very accomplished hunter . 
  he killed lots of animals , many of which were rare and protected . 
  he is particularly proud of hunting a human who happened to be his brother . 
   note : technically she is not a princess , in spain , only the heir gets to be `` prince '' . 
  it 's the best translation they found . 
  there is no other equivalent of `` infanta '' in english . 
  because the conservative party 's rhetoric says that eu is bad . 
  for not changing a director of a state institution , n\u0103stase received $ 400,000 worth of goods and services from her . 
  i suppose the director of the buildings inspectorate received a lot of bribes from businessmen and maybe local city planners who did not respect the laws on constructions , hence her willingness to bribe prime-minister n\u0103stase . 
  n\u0103stase 's previous prison term was due to embezzling state funds to be used for his party 's electoral campaign . 
  his party ( social-democrats ) is currently the larger party in romania 's ruling coalition and if we had today elections , they 'd win more than 50 % of the votes . 
  ( mostly because 70-80 % of the people would n't vote ) during the last 12 months , there have been dozens of politicians convicted for corruption charges and dozens more are currently being tried . 
  the problem is that this is just a drop in a bucket and corruption is as prevalent in politics as it ever was . 
  it 's the view of athens from the acropolis . 
  [ athens ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/athens_skyline.jpg ) makes me feel that in bucharest we do n't have the ugliest skyline in europe . 
   i think there is room for a strong monarchy that is able to check the power of corrupt politicians . 
  what if the monarchs are part of the corrupt clique ? 
  uhm ... 
  i do n't think there was ever a time when people wore pickelhaube helmets without looking like weirdos .
