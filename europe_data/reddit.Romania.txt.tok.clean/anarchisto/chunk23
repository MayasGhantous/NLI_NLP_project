  are we still in kindergarten to call people wearing glasses `` 4-eyed '' ? 
  there is some support , but i do n't think there will ever be a restoration . 
  i guess monarchism will die off when king michael ( aged 92 ) dies . 
  king michael ( who was the king between 1927-1930 and 1940-1947 ) is a symbol for many romanians , but his family is not very well-liked here . 
  there have been plenty of controversial moments related to his family over the years ; last year , for instance , one of his daughters , `` princess irina '' , [ was arrested in oregon for organizing cockfights ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23737283 ) . 
  no , it 's not the same thing . 
  the barcelona urban area has 4.5 million people , while 3 million people live in catalunya outside of the barcelona urban area . 
  the madrid urban area has 6 million people , while 40 million people live in spain outside of the madrid urban area . 
   and starting one yourself ? 
  if i were living in a real democratic country , i would . 
  but the problems with romanian `` democracy '' are : * creating a party requires way too many signatures ( 25.000 and at least a thousand from each of 25 counties ) * the participation tax in the elections is way too expensive ( iirc , it 's around half a million $ ; you get it back if you win any seats ) * if you do n't get any seats for a couple of consecutive elections , your party is automatically disbanded * no real independent press ; any independent candidate ( outside the social-democrats and democratic-liberals cliques ) would get a literally zero press exposure , even if there it had a large grassroot campaign ( as shown during the last bucharest mayoral elections ) * zero electoral debates ; the mainstream parties refuse any kind of debates , even among them ( between the sd and dl parties ) . 
  * electoral fraud : both major parties do it and it 's well known and documented * infiltration by the the secret services ; the secret services are used only for political gains of the mainstream parties and they have a lot of resources . 
  they were caught red-handed spying on journalists and politicians , even inflitrating newspaper staffs . 
  * intimidation by the mobster-politicians of the two mainstream parties, 
   are you serious ? 
  [ article from the site of the president of the pas , november 2013 ] ( http://www.constantinrotaru.ro/2013/11/07/la-invitatia-presedintelui-pas-constantin-rotaru-delegatie-din-coreea-de-nord-in-vizita-la-ramnicu-valcea/ ) : at the invitation of constantin rotaru , the president of the pas , a delegation from north korea visited r\u00e2mnicu v\u00e2lcea . 
  well , at least basque independentists claim so : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_country_ ( greater_region ) . 
  unfortunately , i do n't have any choice , so i 'll stay at home . 
  i could choose between : the corruption wing ( mainstream parties ) : * social-democrats and their conservative and national liberal minions : corrupt oligarchs ( `` moguli '' ) * democratic-liberals and their many and ephemeral minions : corrupt neoliberals * hungarian party : corrupt hungarians the insanity wing ( fringe parties ) : * people 's party : tabloid journalists * greater romania party : ceau\u0219escu-style nationalism * socialist alternative party : people thinking that north korea is a good example to follow, 
  yup . 
  [ the top gdp per capita of the autonomous communities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ranked_lists_of_spanish_autonomous_communities#grp_.28ppp.29_per_capita ) : # 1 basque country $ 40,457 # 2 navarre $ 38,736 ( also part of the basque region ) # 3 madrid $ 38,712 # 4 catalonia $ 34,952 ... # 17 andalusia $ 22,487 # 18 extremadura $ 21,742, 
  the richest regions of spain are catalunya , basque country and madrid ( the latter due to the centralization policy especially during the franco era ) . 
  the basque country were granted fiscal autonomy ( in order to pacify their armed resistence ) , but the madrid government is not willing to do the same to the catalans . 
   it 's pretty difficult to compare low-income and high-income economies . 
  actually , most of south america is nowadays `` middle-income '' , not `` low-income '' just like almost half of the eu ( eastern europe , portugal , greece ) . 
   and argentina is falsying their numbers , you do realize that the world bank and the imf do n't care about the figures released by the government and do their own calculations , independent of those figures , right ? 
  let 's exclude chile . 
  let 's look at brazil : '' [ brazil november net debt to gdp lowest for month since 1997 ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-12-27/brazil-central-government-november-primary-surplus-sets-record ) '' . 
  ok , how about argentina ? 
  it 's debt is at 41 % of the gdp , which is lower than most of the eu countries . 
  romania has about as much debt and it had no growth the last five years , while argentina 's economy boomed . 
  the word `` populist '' is a bullshit term that means `` i do n't like their policies '' . 
  and regarding economic stability , i do n't see any in europe : i can see a sea of misery and stagnation , not just in greece , not just in spain , but across europe . 
  i think that 's supposed to be `` cars '' , not `` golf cars '' . 
  the same issue is in romania 's chart and romania does n't export any golf cars at all . 
  that 2.13 % growth is still going to be higher than romania 's estimated 2 % . 
  let me remind you that large parts of europe ( italy , spain , greece , virtually all of eastern europe ) are rife with corruption as well , in some cases to a larger degree than in south america . 
  europe can learn from latin america . 
  you can look at latin america 's economic growth in the last 10 years . 
  you might say that latin america is poor and that 's why it has high growth rates . 
  but latin america is already starting to get richer than parts of eastern europe . 
  i 'll just take the gdp for instance : romania and bulgaria are poorer ( in gdp/capita ppp , imf data ) than : * venezuela * mexico * panama * uruguay * argentina * chile and brazil is going to surpass us in a year or two . 
  nostalgia for the empire ? 
  long live the [ balkan federation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_federation ) !, 
  probably `` inflation '' should have been `` lowering of living standards '' . 
  it depends what you mean by friends . 
  we had no direct war since the middle ages , but their attitude towards their romanian minority was not that great . 
  also , during the communist era , when the iron curtain was on the danube and romanians tried to excape , if their border guards caught a romanian , they 'd send them to forced labour camps for a year or two before returning them to romania . 
  that 's not a friendly thing to do . 
  for romanians , it 's easier to learn french , italian or spanish than other languages and , among those three , the french culture is obviously the most important . 
  french is still commonly taught in schools , but now it 's often a second language after english . 
  we were back then squeezed between three despotic empires ( russian , ottoman and austrian ) and in this context france appeared like a civilized saviour . 
   nevertheless , france was supportive of us . 
  russia wanted to annex the principalities of wallachia and moldavia and , after occupying them in 1854 , napoleon iii issued them an ultimatum , demanding the russians to retreat their troops , and , failing to do so , he declared war in what came to be the crimean war . 
  ( the brits joined the war on france 's side for their own interests ) the result of the war was that the romanian principalities became quasi-independent , though nominally still under the ottomans . 
  in 1859 , the romanian principalities unified , without a prior approval from any of the european powers that oversaw them after the war . 
  napoleon iii again supported them and eventually convinced the austrians , ottomans and brits to approve it as well . 
   off topic slightly , but malta also tried to join the united kingdom after world war two . 
  also , off topic , there were some voices in romanian politics during the 19th century about us joining france . 
  while this was not possible at the time , the elite did adopt the french culture , many laws were copied from the french corpus of laws , the administration ( for instance , departements headed by a prefect ) , the constitution was basically the belgian constitution , etc. 
  but the departements d'outre les carpates never got a chance , despite napoleon iii 's goodwill towards romania . 
  let me translate it for you :  * the most impressive adjustment program ever undertaken * largest-scale privatization of assets of any state since pinochet  * spectacular reversal in the balance of payments and fiscal * huge cuts on healthcare , education , social safety net , etc. 
   * regaining competitiveness that was lost * the average wage was reduced by over 30 %, 
  i heard that norwegians are the only people who think that london is ` cheap ' . 
   - the estimated number of clients in sweden is the same now as it was prior to the criminalisation of behaviours related to sex work . 
    - the estimated number of sex workers in sweden is the same now as it was prior to the criminalisation of behaviours related to sex work . 
  i do n't know why anyone expected it do be different . 
  criminalizing a kind of behaviour does n't make it go away . 
  ** population : ** * 1989 : 23 million * 2011 : 20 million ( mostly due to emigration to italy , spain , germany and the us ) ** fertility rate : ** * 1989 : 2.2 children * 2012 : 1.36 children ( better access to abortion and contraceptives , but also the disbanding of pro-natalist policies ) ** child mortality : ** * 1989 : 26 per mille * 2012 : 11.9 per mille ( highest in the eu ) ** life expectancy : ** * 1989 : 69.5 years * 2011 : 74.5 years ** hdi : ** * 1985 : 0.792 * 2012 : 0.786 ( calculation method changed ? ),

  as an engineer , i earn ~ 12 times the minimum wage . 
  i guess some people ` won ' from the liberalization and others lost . 
  and in moldova , the region of transnistria has russian troops . 
   if people are not having children is because they are unsure about being able to provide for them . 
  exactly the reason why spain ( with its huge youth unemployment ) has 1.38 children/woman , while sweden has 1.98 children/woman . 
  ( 2010 data , world bank ), 
   bih is completely dysfunctional anyway . 
  you have 3 fucking presidents ... switzerland has [ 7 presidents ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_federal_council ) and it 's not dysfunctional . 
  i 'm sorry , but [ gypsy slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) has been illegal since the 1850s . 
  my pet-peeve in the copyright law is the [ lack of freedom of panorama in many countries ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:freedom_of_panorama_in_europe.svg ) . 
  if i take a photo of a building whose architect is alive or died less than 70 years ago and i put it on my blog , technically , it 's copyright infringement . 
  you may say `` but everyone is ignoring this law '' . 
  yes and that 's a reason why the law is wrong . 
  it 's absurd to ask me to sign a contract and pay royalties in order to put a holiday picture i took on my blog . 
  we 're not protesting against our government even if the europeans look other way . 
  the protests were against widespread corruption in romanian politics and the people who were protesting were mostly middle-class . 
  it 's not a big river , but still a river . 
  it was a plaque with the symbol of the spanish fascists . 
  do you think it would be acceptable in germany to have commemorative plaques with the swastika ? 
  in order for the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 project to proceed it requires that mining law , but since the law was not passed , it can not go on . 
  the main problems are related to expropriation of the landowners who refuse to sell and about the environment-related issues ; for instance , they need to `` move '' a river and apparently , this is not allowed by the legislation . 
   this could be because the eu has no power in those situations or that on some level they 're perfectly okay with multinational corporations having more rights than private eu citizens . 
  actually , the eu does n't seem to care if the basic rights of the citizens are not respected , but they care a lot if the policies taken affect their business interests . 
  for instance , when in hungary , the fidesz had various authoritarian `` reforms '' centralizing the power , no one cared . 
  but when they announced they 'll take over the central bank ( which is supposed to be independent according to the eu ) , the eu was very quickly to intervene with massive sanctions , making the hungarian government to back off . 
  yes , because breaking a few funerary stones is the same thing as killing hundreds of people . 
  ** romania ** : * a new law passed that ** changes some definitions of corruption in politics ** : for instance , the elected politicians are no longer defined `` public servants '' , therefore they are immune for a series of crimes ( such as `` abuse of power '' , `` conflict of interests '' , etc ) . 
  various western countries and western politicians said it 's a step backwards and urged the romanian government to change its mind . 
  * a law was discussed about ** amnesty and exoneration ** for a series of crimes ( including ** corruption ** ) . 
  again , people were outraged , but for this , they postponed the voting of the law .
