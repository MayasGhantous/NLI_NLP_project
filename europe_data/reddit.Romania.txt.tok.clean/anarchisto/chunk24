  * because of the previous two , there 'll be another protest later today ( starting 4-5 pm in bucharest ) against corruption . 
  of course it wo n't solve anything , but at least it will give a hint to politicians that they are being watched . 
   * the changes to the mining law ( which allowed expropriation of private-owned land by private mining corporations and made some exceptions from the environmental protection laws for mining ) did not reach the needed votes in the parliament . 
  this followed months-long protests across romania . 
  leaders of the ruling social-democrats blamed the `` extremists from the street '' for this . 
  * ** protests against shale gas continued ** in punge\u0219ti , vaslui county , while chevron began drilling . 
  the gendarmes ( militarized riot police ) are monitoring very closely ( at one point , they had a policeman at each house who would ask everyone who entered/exit where they were going ) and they disallow some basic rights ( such as groups of more than 2 people in public ) . 
  * daniel barbu , ** the minister of culture resigned ** this week , following some comments about how the budget for aids patients is too high and that if it were halfed and given instead to the culture ministry , he 'd have enough funds for some shakespeare festival . 
  of course , this was found outrageous by virtually everyone and he was forced by his party to resign . 
  actually , it seems to be both : it has both ancient greek doric elements and byzantine greek elements . 
  well , it seems that poland and the baltic countries are advancing towards the western standards , so maybe in 30 years , they 'll reach them . 
  but the rest ( including hungary , romania , bulgaria ) , no . 
   `` the kikes , damn kikes actually , `` jidov '' ( zhidov ) is more like `` yid '' . 
  a word that originally meant simply `` jewish '' ( as it still means in some slavic languages ) , but during the early 20th century it turned into a slur , with `` evreu '' ( < hebrew ) being now used for `` jew '' . 
  an interesting sidestory is the `` jidovi '' ( jews ) were some mythological giants in romanian mythology : in the mountains , where there are large stones that look like ruins , the peasants thought they were ruins of an ancient race of giants . 
  probably because the only ancient nation of which they heard was the jews ( from the bible ) , they thought that the giants were the jews . 
  -- anyway , this was before there was much presence of jews around these parts . 
  it 's likely not even an old carol , at the earliest late-19th century , but , likely mid-20th century , from the era when antisemitism was ` popular ' across europe . 
  it is using some transylvanian words , so it 's from there , but in transylvania there were very few jews until after the russians started the pogroms in late 19th centuries , so it ca n't be that old . 
  i was n't able to find its lyrics on google books , but then , their coverage of romanian books is not great . 
  anyway , the romanian anti-discrimination council gave a 12,000 $ fine to the broadcaster ; within tvr , everyone is trying to put the blame on someone else . 
  you think that things are going in the right direction . 
  for instance , since 1990 , the average income grew by only 30 % ( in real terms , according to the national statistics institute ) . 
  on the other hand , the median income remained at the same level ( due to a muich higher inequality of incomes now ) . 
  but poverty in eastern europe is very much real , it 's not just a stereotype . 
  joining the eu did not solve anything . 
  prices for goods are pretty much the same throughout the eu , but the disparity in wages is huge . 
  millions of romanians and bulgarians live on wages that are under 200 $ / month . 
  ( in romania , the minimum wage is around 140 $ / month after tax and 30 % of all employees get it ), 
  some do not consider it `` continental europe '' . 
   that 's actually quite a lot higher on a per capita basis than the german export . 
  that 's because germany is a much larger market . 
  most employment is created by small and medium enterprises . 
  big corporations tend to increase their staff mostly by buying out those smes . 
  the `` communists '' in eastern europe are not following any communist politics anymore . 
  they have n't since 1990 . 
  they 're following the same neoliberal dogma like your cdu , but they 're far , far more corrupt . 
  the politics/business world was built upon the old party organization . 
  lenin made stalin possible . 
  * he centralized the soviet union * he took away the powers of the workers ' councils * he made the `` right-wing communism '' the official ideology of the revolution * he repressed dissenters ; [ see the repression of anarchists in kronstadt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kronstadt_rebellion ), 
  the oil rigs in the background , probably . 
   social inequality does not explain the anti-semitism but social inequality * does * fuel anti-semitism . 
  the jews are identified with the `` ruthless capitalists '' . 
  the capitalists are a faceless group , it 's hard for them , the uneducated poor , to see a `` class struggle '' with them , it 's easier to identify them with a familiar figure , such as the jew . 
  the identification of capitalism with the jews is not something new , either . 
  hitler identified them as the enemy , using [ marxist imagery ] ( http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/images/giftpilz/scan15.jpg ) and rhetoric that replaced the capitalists with the jews . 
  and even before that , the identification of the jews with the financial world has entered european folklore . 
  no bucharest event ? 
  a good place would be at the [ ukrainian embassy ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest&amp;q=bulevardul+aviatorilor,+24,+sector+1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x40b20206a91afdb7:0xf43f8a747f0a72b7,bulevardul+aviatorilor+24,+bucure%c8%99ti,+romania&amp;ei=5kyius-5gtkgswbf_4coca&amp;ved=0cdaq8gewaa ) , but the police would never allow people to assemble there , especially since it 's in the neighbourhood of the social-democratic party headquarters . 
  so , anyone else in bucharest willing to get arrested and/or fined for illegal protests ? 
   demographically , no . 
  culturally , even less . 
  job-wise , also no . 
  call centers are disappearing as we speak . 
  what about in software/it ? 
  for instance , eastern europe gets a lot of software development outsourcing from western europe . 
  i was surprised to learn that in spain , it 's very tough to get a job as a programmer ( high unemployment ) and that they 're paid quite badly . 
  i assume the same is valid in portugal . 
  is there any reason why companies do n't go there for outsourcing ? 
  well , that was the original meaning , back in the days when lenin was a member of the russian social democratic labour party , the party which then split into bolsheviks and mensheviks . 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) :  social democracy is a political ideology that officially has as its goal the establishment of democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods . 
   to avoid being compared with the planed economies of the soviets . 
  the soviet economy was not `` socialist '' by the original definition of the term . 
  the workers did not have control of the means of production . 
  initially , right after the revolution , the `` soviets '' ( workers ' councils ) did have the power , hence the name of the country , but eventually , the power was transferred to the communist party . 
  since the workers did not control it anymore , they simply changed the definition of socialist . 
  for instance , the definition of `` socialism '' in a dictionary published in socialist republic of romania : `` disbanding private property over the means of production and putting them under the control of the state '' centralizing decision-making in the economy , as implemented in the eastern block was an utterly stupid idea , but it was part of the centralization that started with lenin and then stalin . 
   as of yet no socialist policy has been proposed in respect to corporate and banking law , so inaction is understandable . 
  what about icelandic banks ? 
  socialism used to mean worker control over the means of production . 
  social democracy used to mean achieving socialism through democratic means ( as opposed to revolutionary means ) . 
  communism used to mean a kind of socialism that has an economy not based on the concept of money ( `` from each according to his ability , to each according to his need '' - marx ) and not based on the concept of the state ( an anarchist concept ) . 
  almost no socialist , social-democratic or communist parties preach these ideas anymore . 
  it 's not widely reported even in the romanian media . 
  for instance [ g\u00e2ndul ] ( http://www.gandul.info ) or [ jurnalul na\u021bional ] ( http://jurnalul.ro/ ) do n't report anything at all . 
  [ evenimentul zilei ] ( http://www.evz.ro/ ) have only an opinion piece that says that the law should be applied to bucharest and punge\u0219ti the same way , as protests were allowed in bucharest ( implying that there should be no protests allowed in bucharest , either ) and that disallowing the press from entering the village is `` undemocratic '' . 
  they think that the reason why protests should be banned is that the `` drivers ' consitutional rights '' are being breached by the protesters who occupy the street . 
  however , some other sources do have articles about it , but none of them consider it important , focusing on things like the on-going disputes between the president and the prime minister on the tax on gas . 
   how many rural villagers have lawyers on call ? 
  i bet it 's the neigbhour 's second cousin 's husband or something like that . 
  activism is to a lower level than in western europe , so there are far fewer big ongs . 
  there are a few environmental ongs who gave some support to the locals , but they generally do n't have the power to influence things . 
  the people who own land around the area where the wells are being dug by chevron are not allowed to go to their properties , the whole area is sealed off by gendarmes , who , during monday were estimated at around 800-1000 . 
  journalists are discouraged or even disallowed to enter the village . 
  some independent journalists claim it feels like a `` military dictatorship '' . 
  prime minister ponta congratulated the gendarmes for bringing the `` rule of law '' , which is needed for a `` strong romania '' . 
  the local authorities banned shale gas extraction , but the government argues that such a local regulation is `` against the constitution '' . 
  it 's also banned in the canary islands , but the madrile\u00f1os did n't care about that because they do n't want independence like the catalans . 
  for the people who want see our ugliest former prime-minister better , [ here 's the pic ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/70000/images/_71807_romania300.jpg ) . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure they did n't fill in the proper paperwork for starting a revolution : they should have filled in the form bh-205 * before * occupying a public administration building . 
  the break-up of the austro-hungarian empire happened because it lost the war , there 's no question about that . 
  but do you really think it was possible for the empire to hold on much longer , even without the war ? 
  the czechs , the slovaks , the croats , the bosnians , the romanians , etc. 
  wanted self-rule and , the way i see it , sooner or later , it would have led to a bloody mess . 
   95 years we stole it from hungary this land ( or rather , any land ) should belong to the people who inhabit it . 
  it happens that transylvania had ( and still has ) a romanian majority . 
  can you give me a valid reason why should the hungarian minority decide ? 
  `` we conquered it centuries ago '' is not a valid answer . 
  annexation implies coercion , that the majority of the local population did not wish this , which is not true . 
  transylvania had a romanian majority who resented the hungarian rule and supported the union with romania .
