  there are some criteria for fair and free elections laid out by the council of europe ( the [ venice commission ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venice_commission ) ) , but they 're only recommendations . 
  of course , romania does n't fulfill them . 
  the economic elite of europe is profiting from the corruption in eastern europe , so there 's little that can be done , at least through your politicians . 
  for instance , it may happen that a western company comes here , bribes a few politicians and gets some asset ( resources , infrastructure , factories etc ) from the government at 5 % of its market value . 
  for example , a controlling share ( 51 % ) in our main oil company , petrom , was sold for 700 million $ . 
  its oil reserves alone are worth probably $ 20 billion , let alone infrastructure , refineries , chemical factories , the largest network of gas stations , etc. 
  its yearly profit is $ 1 billion . 
  let 's suppose that a government finds the previous government received bribes and they would want to nationalize it for the price it was privatized . 
  that would be against eu rules and the eu would give us huge fines and will demand us to pay them the real market value . 
  [ the political parties law ] ( http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/14_2003.php ) . 
  your idea of left-wing or right-wing do n't work in the balkans , hence the quotes . 
  here the `` left-wing '' privatized : * water supply * gas supply * oil resources * electricity network now they 've started to privatize the railroads ( so far , it failed ) , the gas resources ( ipo on western stock markets ) , hydro plants ( some shares ) , nuclear plants ( some shares ) , etc. 
  on the long term , they want to fully privatize healthcare and education , but they 're afraid of mass protests , so they 're doing it gradually . 
  the protests against the right-wing began when they announced their plan to privatize the healthcare system ( pretty much the us system , just with more uninsured people ) , but the left-wing is equally willing to do that , too . 
   the protests want to change that with the resignation of the current government . 
  it seems naive to me . 
  the protests started against the `` right-wing '' government of borisov . 
  eventually , the government fell and a new left-wing government took its place . 
  the protests continued aginst the `` left-wing '' government of oresharski , so no , it 's not like they want the `` right-wing '' government back . 
  they want something different . 
  exactly how this `` different '' should be , it 's hard to say . 
  in romania , some politicians argued that the protesters here ( who also protest both against the left-wing coalition and against the right-wing parties ) argued that the protesters must be against democracy , because `` there 's no such thing as a democracy without parties '' . 
   how is the bulgarian government dealing with the protests the same strategies as in romania : * ignoring them : for months * name-calling : [ the protesters are called `` hooligans '' ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/13/bulgarias-ruling-socialists-blame-hooligan-protesters-vow-to-stay/ ) * intimidation : [ 50 people arrested ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/13/bulgaria-more-than-50-arrests-after-students-parliament-protest/ ) , thousands of police in the street * pretending that there is a dispute , with people pro and con : [ organizing `` rival '' pro-government protests ] ( http://sofiaglobe.com/2013/11/14/bulgarias-protests-rival-rallies-set-for-november-16/ ) ( presumably people that were paid for the day to protest ), 
  in romania , the political system is thought up to prevent new parties . 
  * you need headquarters in at least 15 counties . 
  headquarters require money for rent , which small parties do n't have . 
  * you need to raise 25,000 signatures , with at least 700 in each of 18 counties . 
  * you need to pay a $ 400,000 tax in order to participate in the elections ( a huge sum for a county where the average wage is under $ 400 ) * you need to get minimum 5 % in the national elections in order to get any parliamentary seats ( even if you won some electoral districts ) * you need to get that minimum percentage or else the party is automatically disbanded * the mainstream parties will have their own infiltrated people who will try to rip the party apart * the press is owned by the mainstream politicians and they will simply ignore you , even if you have some popular support . 
  * if you are an independent candidate and you win an electoral district with 49 % ( the mainstream parties gaining 20 % , 10 % and 5 % ) , you lose . 
  in one word , the problem is ** corruption ** and , associated with it , widespread poverty . 
  some details , based on romanian politics ( i 'm certain it 's the same in bulgaria ) : the political system is a sham democracy . 
  you can choose between several parties , but their policies are practically identical . 
  it does n't matter who you choose because the result is identical . 
  you might think that in the us or western europe , it does n't matter , but here the difference is really nil . 
  the political parties are some kind of a closed castes . 
  you need to know someone in order to get inside . 
  when you get inside , you * must * be involved in their shady deals , or else , you 'll not be promoted . 
  there is no such thing as a clean and honest person in our politics and i really mean * literally none * , no exceptions . 
  such a honest person would not be controllable by the leaders of the party , and as such , would be unreliable and might even try to rid out of their corruption system . 
  the idea is that all the party leaders have their own clients ( lower-level members ) , whom they control through blackmail and internal bribing . 
  these people also have some lower party members and so on , until the lowest members . 
  -- every public contract involves corruption . 
  yes , even ( or rather , especially ) the big western corporations pay bribes ; yes , ibm ( i worked for them at one time , so i know about it from non-public sources ) , ericsson , bechtel , siemens , mercedes , etc. 
  pay bribes to romanian officials . 
  i read a study that said that more than a third of the state budget is lost through corruption . 
  that 's probably an underestimation . 
  anyway , the `` public service '' works like this : some guy bribes his way through the party lines to become a director , a minister or whatever public official ; then he tries to get as much money out of his new office as possible . 
  the corporations ( or sometimes , local companies ) sell goods and services at a hugely inflated markup ( often 100-200 % more than the free market ) , part of which is given to the state official who approved the deal . 
  you 're not scared by the looks , you 're scared by the attitude . 
  and do n't forget the krokodil . 
  the same thing happens in europe as well . 
  once in a while , we hear about dozens of eastern europeans ( poles , romanians , bulgarians , balts , etc ) who were held in almost-slavery in western european countries . 
  yes , the euro loans would have been the cheapest , but i think it was silly to give the risk to the consumers , instead of the banks . 
  but then , virtually every decision made by the national bank was against the regular consumers and in favour of the ( foreign-owned ) banks . 
  the most absurd was when the national bank called the government not to apply the laws regarding `` abusive contracts '' to loan contracts because the profits of the banks would have been affected by this . 
  basically , it invited the banks to ignore the laws because they knew this would require a lengthy litigation and most people would not afford it . 
  also , it strongly opposed the idea of personal bankruptcy and resisted any attempt to reform the banking system to the kind of system they have in western europe . 
  ( i.e. 
  with more consumer protection ), 
  enough money to cover basic expenses might encourage people to do things that would otherwise be considered foolish ( from a financial point of view ) , but which would end up having high social or even economic value . 
  some people might want to have a start-up with an crazy idea . 
  it might work , it might not , but currently they would not risk if they were risking to be thrown out in the street . 
  the owner of the company for which i work ( from norway ) spent a year developing by himself a software application while living out of his wife 's wage and with a loan from his in-laws . 
  now his company employs 100 people . 
  i wonder how many people did not follow the urge to start a company because they were afraid : what if the wife gets fired ? 
  what would two people with an infant son without an income do ? 
  hungary , while not nationalising banks , mandated that all loans to be made in forints . 
  i 'm not sure how well it went , though . 
   i see . 
  but paying a high interest in leis may be a pretty rational choice , if you can expect it will be inflated that much over the course of many years . 
  but it did not fall that much . 
  since 2007 , 1 $ went from 3.5 lei to 4.4 lei ( 25 % depreciation ) , but the cummulative interest rate for a loan in lei would have been well over 50 % , probably close to 100 % . 
  because most banks refused to give any loans in the local currency . 
  some banks did allow some mortgages in romanian lei , but at outrageous interest rates ( 30 % ) . 
  he had the choice between eur , usd and chf . 
  he chose chf because it had the lowest interest rate . 
  most people ( around 80-90 % ) choose euro . 
  my co-worker who got suckered into a chf mortgage back in 2007 would love some depreciation for your currency . 
   one franc went from 1.8 lei back then to 3.6 lei now . 
  the gendarmes here in romania got a lot of paid overtime . 
  exactly the same happened during the protests in bucharest : they want to intimidate and/or annoy the protesters . 
  we had dozens of marches/protests and , in all , i walked with the protesters more than 100 km around bucharest . 
  here , during one of the protests there were ** a lot ** of riot police ( gendarmes ) , several hundreds , similar to the pic there . 
  at first they were along the edges of a square , not allowing us to get into the street , arguing that we would prevent the traffic ( it was sunday at 7 pm , not much traffic ) . 
  we just went to another street and used the boulevard to march to the government building , where the gendarmes surrounded us and would not allow us to go anywhere . 
  the strategy was that there were some `` brave '' people who were trying to break the police lines , they would be `` caught '' and while the gendarmes were busy with them , the crowd would simply go through . 
  next , the gendarmes tried to separate or block the crowd without much success . 
  i do n't understand why , because it was obvious that you ca n't stop thousands of people who are marching without arresting them or using violence . 
  so , this is what you should know : * avoid confrontation , if possible * if the police are blocking a road , use another * if the police are waiting for the protesters in a square , go to another square * if the police are surrounding you , try to break their lines and the crowd should advance at once it 's essential that there are many protesters . 
  yeah , but in romania ( the twin sister of bulgaria , so i guess they do the same ) we spend more on police than either on education or healthcare . 
  and we spend more on ( police + army + secret services )  ( education + healthcare ) . 
  [ see the data here ( in romanian ) ] ( http://openspending.org/buget-de-stat2013/views/romania-bugetul-de-stat-2013 ), 
   bribe an official to give you an authentic certificate of birth and a moldawian passport , take the bus/train to romania and claim your romanian citizenship the birth certificate needs to say that your parents are some actual moldovans , because romania would then cross-check your ancestors in the interwar records , to see if they were really romanian citizens back then . 
  of course , but ** these ** turks were recent colonists . 
   if you think that turkey would sacrifice the interests of turkish cypriots the turkish cypriots are colonists that were brought to the island by turkey from anatolia following the turkish invasion in 1974 . 
  the colonization of cyprus was a clear violation of international treaties and the only similar situation is in the israeli settlements in the occupied territories . 
  i think the turkish pm wants to make sure that turkey has no chance to join the european union . 
  cyprus is a member of the eu and it 's obvious that without recognizing them , turkey would not be able to join it . 
   eurozone problems are still exactly same as they were in 1988 when krguman wrote his the euro : beware of what you wish for . 
  actually , the article is from 1998 .
