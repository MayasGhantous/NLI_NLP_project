  also , an interesting part :  emu was n't designed to make everyone happy . 
  it was designed to keep germany happy . 
  nazism , like any ethnocentric ideology , can be adapted to any ethnic group . 
  the difference between `` german nazism '' and a `` polish nazism '' would be just who is the superior race . 
  may i ask what do you think is the difference between these `` nationalists '' ( the press calls them `` far-right '' ) and neonazis ? 
  i can see they hate foreigners ( for instance , russians ) and left-wingers and that they use violence against them . 
  and if these `` nationalists '' are like those in hungary , croatia or romania , they probably hate jews and racial minorities ( gypsies , africans ) , too . 
   a reuters reporter said one section of the crowd headed in the direction of the russian embassy , but riot police formed a cordon around the building . 
  many polish nationalists dislike russia , their country 's former colonial ruler . 
    the principal target of the rioters appeared to be any manifestation of left-wing , liberal views . 
  * [ youtube video of the violence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odd8fuh5-qk ) * [ voice of russia article ] ( http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_11_11/riots-in-warsaw-russian-embassy-attacked-reports-1174/ ) ( with more youtube links ), 
  here , it 's like this : people protest ( about cyanide mining , about shale gas , etc ) , all the politicians ( from all the parliamentary parties ) start attacking the protesters . 
  they are , according to various politicians : * `` useless citizens '' who do n't understand that democracy should be done with parties . 
  opposing a policy that is supported by all parties is obviously anti-democratic . 
  * traitors paid by the hungarians , george soros ( being a hungarian jew means he 's two-enemies-in-one ) , the russians , etc. 
  * hipsters who have well-paying jobs and they do n't know how hard things are in the countryside ( when educated middle class people protested in the big cities ) * peasants who are stupid and do n't understand modern technology ( when peasants protested in the countryside ) * `` eco-terrorists '' , `` extreme-left anti-capitalists '' , `` extreme-right neofascists '' , etc. 
  * `` a danger to national security '' ( according to the romanian intelligence services ) in romania , all that protests achieved was a postponing until the winter starts . 
  they hope people wo n't protest when there 's snow and blizzard . 
  snowden prevented the british intelligence services from acquiring information about the opposing team strategies !, 
  indeed , finance is not a very labour-intensive sector , like industry , so this would lead to higher unemployment and inequality . 
  well , if the uk quits the eu , that would be the fatal to whatever industry they still have , not just carmaking . 
  on the other hand , not being bound by any eu regulations on finance might be a good thing for their financial `` industries '' , but i do n't think that 's a good long-term strategy . 
  one of the core principles of the eu is that the central banks must be independent ( in practice , banker controlled ) , so nobody voted for them and democratic control would even be against eu regulations . 
   the suspect , a man in his 50s of foreign origin , has been arrested foreign origin is the code word . 
  well , it 's more of a cultural statement . 
  they say by this that they want to be part of europe , not of russia . 
  so is [ love building ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s_hurn9ktc ) . 
   i get the feeling , it 's not even the romas but rather romania and bulgaria . 
  the czech republic and slovakia have the same problems as romania and bulgaria . 
  it 's just that romania and bulgaria have more of them . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the fact that [ romania had them enslaved for centuries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) had something to do with it . 
  many of the balkan roma outside romania are in fact runaway slaves from romania . 
  that 's journalism in a place where nothing really happens . 
  a friend told me that in helsinki they had front page news about a woman who was trapped in an elevator for several hours . 
  and some political articles : `` victor ponta ( pm of romania ) : we 'll boost the romanian industry through opening diploma mills '' `` the government proposes changing the name of the romanians to gypsies , so they would not be confused with the roma '' `` pm victor ponta caught his wife daciana in bed with mp victor ponta '' ( after ponta claimed he will vote as mp against the law project proposed by him as pm ) `` pm ponta and president b\u0103sescu argue on a new issue : who should write santa claus ? '', 
  ( after ponta and b\u0103sescu argued over who should go to the eu meetings in brussels ), 
   a borderline anarchist state a borderline * chaotic * state , but yeah , that 's almost true . 
   apart from military conflict with russia , something that is frankly inevitable you think that the russia are the natural-born enemies of romania . 
  they 're not . 
  russia applies exactly the same tactics as the us . 
  they can be gentle and helpful when it 's in their interest , but cruel , violent and inhumane when they can get away with it . 
  both the us and the soviet union influenced our politics , imposed upon us how we should rule ourselves , what decisions we should take and what we should not do . 
  the ideology was different , but we were forced to abide to the orthodox ideology : first the soviet authoritarian socialism , then the washington consensus . 
  having troops on our soil just makes even easier to enforce this ideology . 
   when a conference was organized , few years back , by the great powers to discuss the future of moldova and transnistria , romania was not even invited . 
  that 's the weight romania has on the international scene . 
  this conference you 're talking happened in 2011 , 8 years after the first american base ( in kog\u0103lniceanu , constan\u021ba county ) was built in romania . 
  also , do you really think the us will do anything that is not in its own interest , just to please romania ? 
   what absurdly contorted logic . 
  what exactly are you trying to say ? 
  i 'm saying that bringing a gun to a poker table may change the rules of the game . 
  insults bring absolutely nothing to this conversation . 
  you may not care about what i think , but think that other people want to read the arguments of an actual debate , not just people insulting each other . 
  what do we have to gain from having foreign troops on our soil ? 
  are we going not to `` survive '' if we fail to ally ourselves with them ? 
  who 's going to kill us ? 
  the talibans ? 
  the russians ? 
  this is europe , they ca n't do the dirty stuff in the open like they do in latin america . 
  they would just provoke a hungarian-romanian ethnic dispute ( as bloody as needed ) in transylvania , then occupy romania as a peacekeeping / `` democratization '' mission . 
  for a bit of historical context , here 's a list of periods during which there were foreign military bases in romania ( wallachia for before 1859 ) : * 1430-1877 - ottoman empire ( with interludes of temporary austrian and russian occupations ) * 1916-1918 - german empire * 1944-1958 - soviet union * 2003-present - united states expected responses : * `` but it 's not the same thing , we 're allies '' -- so we were within the warsaw pact with the soviet union . 
  * `` but the romanian leadership agreed '' -- so did the romanian leadership during wwii agreed to bring the soviet troops ; the pro-german government set up during wwi ( they were later convicted as `` traitors '' ) and obviously , the romanian nobility ( boyars ) during the ottoman empire . 
  * `` but they 're defending romania from the external threats '' -- the same thing the ottomans claimed . 
  * `` but we do n't pay a tribute like in the old ottoman days '' -- i 'm not so sure ; we do n't pay to the us government , but we pay money to american companies for political deals ; for instance , the infamous bechtel `` deal '' , through which we paid 1.4 billion $ for 50 km of motorway . 
   we 're too busy making ~ ~ jet engines ~ ~ * trades on the derivatives market . 
  * ftfy . 
  britain does n't make that many * things * anymore . 
  at least here , foreigners already bought a lot of the land , through romanian-registered companies . 
   the countries who are against the admission are far more afraid of poverty immigration from those countries . 
  schengen has only to do with border controls , not with the right to settle in another country . 
  people who wanted to move to western europe moved there already ( about 3 million people from romania ) . 
  they do n't have any problems mixing with the `` locals '' and i guess most roma have a substantial amount of european ancestry . 
  in some cases , there are roma who almost only european ancestry . 
  for instance , there i saw a mother with a blonde child in bra\u0219ov who were speaking roma language . 
  ( the child was probably hers , since the mother was light-haired as well ), 
  a serbian friend says `` what kind of a country is romania if for them , serbia is ` the west ' ? 
  there is no `` transnistrian '' nationalism . 
  there are russian , moldovan , romanian and ukrainian nationalisms . 
  from what i understand from newspaper articles , the people in the transnistrian countryside ( regardless of ethnicity ) are afraid and very cautious of everything , so it 's hard to know what they really think . 
  they simply do n't want to tell you what they think . 
  in one article , the journalist said that in a moldovan village , people were speaking romanian and listening to romanian-language music ( manele ) . 
  when the journalist approached them , they started talking russian and pretended not to know how to speak romanian . 
  i guess that living the last 20 years in a country that everything is arbitrary and at the will of some thugs . 
  mr. smirnov ( the leader of the transnistrian communist party ) virtually owns the country ( so psd 's local barons would be proud of him ) , while doing a lot of shady deals ( so pdl 's [ mr. costel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/costel_iancu ) would be proud ) . 
  probably they 'd want to integrate into psd or pdl here . 
   a very large and often fanatical muslim community the french muslims are less fanatical than those in the uk . 
  they are more of a social problem in france ( not enough integration and discrimination ) than a problem with terrorism . 
   you did n't answer my question , would you be willing to pay these taxes ? 
  i already pay taxes this high . 
  i just calculated on the taxes i pay and it 's exactly 49 % ( including vat ) . 
  36 % income tax ( a special incentive tax rate for programmers , the regular workers pay 44 % ) + 24 % vat = 49 %, 
  no , it 's the same language . 
  the standard language is identical , but the vernacular moldovan has a slightly different accent . 
  ( it 's similar to the accent spoken in romanian part of moldavia ) of course , they also have a few words that are not used in romania . 
  you mean that having a stronger currency would affect their exports ? 
  yes , that 's true , but that should be offset by the romanian investment and money inflow . 
   in concrete terms , if you now earn 100 euros , you get 71.9 euros after all taxes , including vat , would you be a-okey if you would only get 51 euros after all taxes ? 
  i would be ok if it would be a fair system . 
  i saw a eurostat graph which showed the `` tax on work '' in romania is the second highest in the eu ( after denmark ) . 
  let 's supposed i am a worker whose employer gives me 100 $ .
