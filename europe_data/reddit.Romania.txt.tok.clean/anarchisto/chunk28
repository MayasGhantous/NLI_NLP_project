  44 $ are taxes ( income taxes + social security + healthcare + payroll taxes ) , 56 $ is my income . 
  from this we subtract the vat and we get 44 $ . 
  likely less than the taxes you pay . 
  let 's supposed i am a business owner . 
  i get 100 $ in income . 
  16 $ are taxes ( flat rate tax ) . 
  84 $ is my post-tax income if i 'm `` stupid '' and i do n't create an offshore company . 
  otherwise , i do n't pay a dime . 
  and of course , politicians keep talking about reducing the flat rate tax , not about reducing the fiscal burden on workers . 
  which makes me wonder what dirty secrets they know about romanian politicians . 
  almost all politicians ( including all those who have the actual power ) act like lobbyists for american companies even if they lose votes for that . 
  it 's not just plain corruption because european companies grease their palms as well and they do n't get this special treatment . 
  the russians and moldovans of transnistria do n't want that , either . 
  transnistria is a special case because there are 1/3 russians , 1/3 moldovans , 1/3 ukrainians . 
  the transnistrian countryside is half moldovan , half ukrainian , while the cities ( mainly tiraspol ) are mostly russian . 
  the solution would be to integrate the moldovan part into moldova , the ukrainian part into ukraine and make tiraspol ( population : 135k ) an independent city-state . 
  eu-level social services would do more for both eu integration and regional development than all the programs currently in place . 
  of course , another great idea would be a eu-wide healthcare system , but i ca n't see that being done during my lifetime ... 
   the currency problem with moldovans because they will most likely have to change their leu to our leu/euro the monetary mass of moldova is very small compared to the one of romania , so changing their lei to our lei wo n't affect us much . 
  * romanian monetary mass ( m2 ) : 220 billion romanian lei = 49.5 billion $ * moldovan monetary mass ( m2 ) : 22 billion moldovan lei = 1.2 billion $, 
  exactly . 
  generational and possibly educational divide . 
  the young and the educated moldovans support a union with romania . 
  i heard from a moldovan friend that virtually every friend of his supports it , but that 's hardly the case for the whole moldovan society . 
  the main problem is not whether * we * want the union , but whether * they * want it . 
  throughout the last two decades , the moldovans and their leadership have grown more pro-romanian , but it 's still too early . 
  i guess it would take another decade or two before it would be feasible . 
  also , there 's the issue of transnistria , which is hard to solve . 
  ( probably we 'd need some special autonomy clauses in our constitution ), 
  this conspiracy theory makes no sense because russia 's gazprom ( through a serbian subsidiary ) was also awarded some areas in romania where it wants to extract shale gas . 
  it 's easy to see that the romanian-language version `` voice of russia '' is spinning the protests as being `` anti-american '' , not `` anti-fracking '' . 
  we do n't own our country anymore . 
  most of it is owned by western european and american companies . 
  for instance , out of the top 100 exporters in 2011 , 98 were foreign-owned . 
  the two remaining romanian-owned companies have been closed since ( one by the government , oltchim , the other because it no longer gets cheap natural gas ) we did n't complain about not owning our country anymore , it 's the capitalist logic , afterall and we do n't have any capital . 
  but we started complaining when american-owned companies come here , bribe our politicians and they get almost for free our resources ( we get 5-6 % of what they extract ) , while we must pay for the pollution they create . 
  it feels too much like we 're a colony . 
  microscopical particles can penetrate into the lungs leading to huge numbers of deaths . 
  in the eu , around 3-400 .000 people die every year due to pollution-caused asthma , lung cancer , respiratory diseases , etc. 
  china has a couple of millions deaths . 
  this is `` poor man 's pollution '' and arguably an effect of the eu entry . 
  in eastern europe , the prices of electricity and gas were kept low to consumers as a form of welfare . 
  however , following the eu entry , we had to adopt the eu internal market rules , which say that we need to sell them to the eu internal market price . 
  if a german company wants to buy poland so we 're having eastern european wages ( minimum wage in bulgaria is 158 $ / month , in poland 368 $ / month ) and we pay western european prices for heating . 
  people ca n't afford natural gas or electricity for heating , so they switched to `` dirty '' heating sources during the winter : wood or coal . 
  this results is slightly lower prices for western consumers and companies and thousands of early deaths for the eastern europeans .

  and the soviets decided for us to become a republic . 
  i 'm also waiting for the related conferences called :  implosion : the end of america and what it means for russia and  implosion : the end of china and what it means for europe, 
  here there are many thousands of homeless people ( including children ) , but i do n't see as many who care for them as there are people who care about the stray dogs . 
  and based on online interaction with `` animal lovers '' , they tend to really hate people , or they think that the life of one dog equals the life of one human . 
  the `` dogs are n't jews to be sent to auschwitz '' comment by an ong was probably the most outrageous , but hardly a surprise . 
  also , they think that there 's a big conspiracy against stray dogs : i 've seen blog articles claiming that the child killed by dogs was in fact murdered using attack dogs and then the stray dogs were blamed . 
  similar conspiracies were passed around in the `` dog lover community '' when a stray dog killed a japanese businessman a few years ago . 
  eventually , a cctv camera showed there was no conspiracy , just a stray dog attack . 
  what 's absurd is that the dog that killed the japanese was n't even euthanised : the pro-stray dog ongs took him out of the country illegally . 
  and besides , most albanians are already in the eu ( italy ) . 
  correction : oxford university is older than the aztec ** empire **, 
  in scandinavia , due to the wet and cold climate , the fire wo n't spread to the trees . 
  i remember how an outdoors-loving american said that when he went hiking in the woods with his friends they put a woman in front of the group because if they get onto some private land , the owner might shoot them without warning . 
  if the owner sees a woman first , it 's less likely to shoot right away . 
  i know this `` reliable gentleman '' . 
  he 's polite , soft-spoken the first time you meet him . 
  then : * he bribes every politician in order to obtain his permits * he lies in the documentation he submits to the government * he buys all the press to be in his favor * he threatens your government asking for billions in damages if he does n't get his way, 
  in romania , we had protests against shale gas exploitation by chevron due to concerns regarding environmental damage . 
  people living in the areas where the fracking will be done do n't get any benefits from them and they 're afraid that it will affect their water supply . 
  the latest issue was that during the last two weeks , in the area where chevron is digging some exploratory wells , occurred a large number ( over 200 ) of small intensity earthquakes . 
  the earthquakes themselves were n't dangerous , but their large number lead to cracks in walls and made some houses dangerous to use . 
  the government was talking about moving the people away from those villages . 
  anyway , the authorities say that the shale gas exploration and the earthquakes are just a coincidence , but locals connect the two . 
  ( some connections between fracking and earthquakes has been previously noted in the us , see [ `` fracking practices to blame for ohio earthquakes '' ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/science/fracking-practices-blame-ohio-earthquakes-8c11073601 ) ), 
  you wo n't get to be independent . 
  instead of being dependent on gazprom , you 'll be dependent on chevron or whatever western company is doing the extraction . 
  the consumers will pay exactly the same price . 
  it would be against eu legislation to sell you gas that is cheaper than the eu internal market 's price . 
  if you do n't leave your home , there 's no problem . 
  here , every accountant must pay a fee of 175 $ / year to be a member of that professional association . 
  of course , that association does n't give you anything in exchange . 
   yes , you have to do few years of practice and pass exam to be able to represent someone before court in poland here , in romania : * you can represent yourself before a court * you can be represented by a relative holding a law degree ( without passing the bar exam ) * you can be represented by a lawyer after passing the bar exam and doing the few years of practice the organization is interested in having the number of lawyers to a minimum to keep their incomes high . 
  similar organizations are for accountants and public notaries . 
  of course there are people who are willing to help , i 'm not disputing that , but the problem is that within the last 20 years , the ngos were not able to organize a way to solve the problem without being forced by the spectre of euthanasia . 
  in fact , even under the new law , if they 're willing , the ongs can adopt stray dogs from city hall shelters , which leads me to think that they do n't want to take care of the dogs , they want them to be on the streets . 
  we have the following `` stake '' - holders in this issue of the strays : * the animal protection ongs want the strays to stay on the streets because they get generous donations from western europe . 
  if the stray problem is solved in any way , the funding ends and they 'd have to get a real job . 
  * the local administration want the strays to stay on the streets because they get to use huge sums of money for the sterilization , `` catch-and-release '' programs and other other programs ; embezzlement is common for these sums . 
  * the central administration : the government wants to show that they 're taking measures , so they 're trying to push laws regarding the euthanization of strays . 
  the opposition is , traditionally , trying to derail any government proposal . 
  * the people overwhelmingly want the strays out of the streets . 
  it 's a serious public health and safety issue . 
  we had lots of people killed by strays , including a japanese businessman and a 4-year old child . 
   the uk has the most citations per head of population ( nearly twice as many as the us iirc ) on the planet and the scandinavians do well . 
  the citations are proportional to the percentage of all scientific works being published in english . 
  in some scientific fields in continental europe , publishing in their local languages is still rather common . 
   greece was then at about the same level as romania it 's so easy to build arguments if you ignore the reality . 
  gdp per capita estimates ( [ 1938 ] ( http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/historical_statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls ) ) , in 1990 dollars ( ppp ) : * greece : $ 2,677 * romania : $ 1,242 greece = 2.15 x romania gdp per capita estimates ( ppp , 2012 , world bank ) : * greece : $ 25,331 * romania : $ 16,518 greece = 1.53 x romania even though greece had a huge amount of money pumped in by the us ( marshall plan ) and the eu , they still grew less than we did . 
   even if a bunch of slums did end up being ripped up , they did n't really replace them with things that are much better . 
  the slums had no indoor plumbing ( people relied on wells , and , later , pumps ) and many of the houses were made out of adobe ( manure + clay + straw ) bricks . 
  the heating was done through wood stoves . 
  most streets were not paved and they were very muddy when raining and dusty when dry . 
  a few streets were paved with round river stones .
