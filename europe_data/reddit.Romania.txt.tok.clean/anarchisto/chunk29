  i used to live during the 1980s/1990s into an apartment building in one of those `` new '' neighbourhoods and there was nearby a remainder of the old neigbhourhood , so i know what it was . 
  it was definitely not a lush suburb like many people think . 
  i looked on google street view and it seems that almost none of the old houses still remain , most were demolished by their owners after 1990 and new and bigger/modern houses were built . 
  nevertheless , i did find [ one still standing ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.414609,26.149548&amp;spn=0.002038,0.006947&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.414609,26.149548&amp;panoid=utlra2v6d5ihzfjcbapxew&amp;cbp=11,50.34,,0,0.56&amp;z=18 ) . 
  ( with an addition that kept its slummy look ) also see the [ apartment buildings that replaced the slum ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.413763,26.149896&amp;spn=0.002038,0.006947&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.413762,26.149898&amp;panoid=-4fbod-lmsyb39io_dcz3g&amp;cbp=11,120.37,,0,-2.92&amp;z=18 ) . 
   and the people 's palace does not have ac , is unnecessarily big , and the resources put into making it could 've gone into more important things of course , building the people 's palace was pointless , it was built just for ceau\u0219escu 's ego . 
  i 'm not arguing that . 
   both are right , greece/serbia were conquered but kept the ottomans busy with constant revolts and fighting same in romania , plenty of backstabbing of the turks after the conquest . 
  most famous is vlad the impaler ( dr\u0103culea ) , who had a pathological hate for muslims . 
  for instance , from a 1462 letter by him to matthias corvinus of hungary :  i have killed men and women , old and young , who lived at oblucitza [ old name of isaccea ] and novoselo , where the danube flows into the sea , up to rahova , which is located near chilia , from the lower danube up to such places as samovit and ghighen . 
  we killed 23,884 turks and bulgars without counting those whom we burned in homes or whose heads were not cut by our soldiers ... thus your highness must know that i have broken the peace with him [ the sultan ] . 
  after a while , the turks got sick of the romanians ' so they gave the voivodships to the greeks from phanar , whom they considered more reliable . 
  romania : ** captain corruption ** ( * c\u0103pitanul corup\u021bie * ) tagline : during the day , he 's a low-level bureaucrat at the romanian government , but at night , he turns into captain corruption !, 
  superpower : he 's able to get a kickback from every government acquisition contract strength : he will delay giving any authorization unless you give him a bribe weaknesses : he switches sides during the middle of the battle when someone gives him a small bribe sidekick : mrs. 
  embezzlement ( aunt bezzie ) archenemy : transparency man, 
  i assume that it 's a tax relief for the first 2500 chf you 'd pay in tax, 
   those problems with dambovita and the lakes and the lack of highways , i 'm pretty sure they would have been taken care of 10 times better if a communist regime did n't existed in romania . 
  if there was no communist era , the leadership would have been the same as the one during the 1900s-1940s . 
  in case you do n't know how inter-war romania was , i 'll remind you that we had a society that was closer to what africa had than to western europe : * we had a rich 1 % class ( capitalists , landowners ) , a 5 % `` middle-class '' ( urban intellectuals , etc ) and a big mass of illiterate peasants and wokers who were barely able to survive . 
  * 80 % of the people were peasants , most of them living in small adobe houses . 
  * half of the people were illiterate , [ see map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:romania_1930_literacy_en.svg ) * most people had no access to any kind of healthcare , which meant that even an easily treatable disease was often fatal * due to the lack of healthcare , 20 % of children failed to reach the age of 5 , which meant that we had a ** life expectancy of 42 years ** , almost 20 years less than western europe . 
  * when peasants or workers striked or protested , the government had no problem with sending in the army and killing them . 
  * we had some kind of `` democracy '' , meaning you could vote for the establishment parties ; any kind of politics that was considered `` radical '' ( including the communist party ) was banned and anyone caught with communist manifestos was arrested right away . 
  the constitution banned the death penalty , with one exception : communist propaganda . 
  * malnutrition and the spectre of starvation were day-to-day problem for large parts of the population . 
  * less than 1 % of the population attained higher education , which was not an option for most of the population i 'm not an apologist of the communist regime , which could have done the improvements in literacy , education and sanitation without the large human cost , but without a radical change , there was not a chance of changing anything . 
  the political class before 1948 was exactly the same as the one we have now : extremely corrupt , caring about their well-being and their businesses , not about the people . 
  99 % of what was demolished were shacks and adobe huts from the slums outside the city center , so nothing of value was lost when they were replaced with modern apartment buildings . 
  the `` fancy shit '' was exclusively in the city center : look at 1930s photos of `` old bucharest '' and you 'll notice that almost everything survived , with some exceptions that were bombed during wwii or fell during the 1977 earthquake . 
  the only neighbourhood that had some nice houses ( not necesarily of historical importance , however ) was the one on the uranus hill , that was replaced with the people 's palace . 
  also , there were a few churches of some moderate historical interest . 
  however , the only thing that i consider that was an important historical building that was demolished was the v\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti monastery . 
  some individual houses from across the city center were demolished , but there were more of them demolished since 1990 than during the ceau\u0219escu era . 
  ... and [ cia-funded anti-communist music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pknslgamgkk ) . 
  but of course , most music during the 1950s had nothing ideological ; most popular during that era were `` roman\u021be '' , just like before the war . 
  also , maria t\u0103nase continued her musical activity during this time . 
  i do n't believe in vigilantism : it would only lead to more violence . 
  i believe much of the crime can be prevented , being either due to mental issues , lack of education and/or social exclusion of some groups ( african americans , gypsies , maghrebians , etc ) . 
  i believe that the solution would be `` treatment '' , not `` punishment '' . 
  this is especially true for the most common crimes in western world : drug-related crimes . 
   the church wants to sell plots for burial and get the fee for performing the burial rituals . 
  here , the church just banned orthodox priests from holding any burial services in any cemeteries that are not owned by the church . 
  again , the problem is that they want to sell plots for burials at huge prices . 
  i might understand you if you claimed it 's utopical or impractical , but why abhorrent ? 
  of course , i realize that pure `` anarchism '' would be just as impossible as `` pure communism '' , `` pure capitalism '' , `` pure < any-ideology  '' , but i mean as a general direction to follow . 
  why do you think that a world with less coercion and less hierarchical would be worse than what we have now ? 
  here , the parliament has not yet passed the law that would allow the mining project to go on , but it seems that it will pass , despite the widespread protests across the country . 
  everyone agrees that the mining project got so far only through widespread corruption at all levels , even the prime-minister and president acknowledged the corruption in the development of the project . 
  however , almost every politician agrees that the project must go on , despite of this . 
  well , the people who call themselves `` anarchists '' and people who insult other people by `` anarchist '' have different meanings for the word . 
  the insult is used typically to mean `` nihilist '' or `` person who wants chaos '' . 
  people who use it for themselves nowadays typically use it to mean a society in which there is no hierarchy , a society based on free associations , not on coercion . 
  many anarchists oppose violence or are/were pacifists ( for instance , leo tolstoy ) . 
   demonstrations against the project had been manipulated by people he called `` eco-anarchists . '', 
  i think he used the word `` anarchist '' as an insult . 
  anyway , it 's just another insult to the pile ( epithets given by politicians and journalists ) : * `` just some hipsters '' * `` eco-terrorists '' * `` communists '' and `` socialists '' * `` a danger for national security '' * `` paid by george soros '' * it 's `` the protesters ' parents fault '' for `` failing to give their children a pro-capitalist view '' * `` useless citizens '' * having the `` anticapitalist sentimentality '' disease * `` anti-system mechanisms '' * `` some poor souls who do n't do n't know much '' * `` hipsters with mental issues '' * `` economic nationalists '' * `` against democracy '' * acting like `` 19th century poets horrified by industry '', 
  they want to sue the people who have money . 
  we still have some wildlife left . 
   there was never a time that i remember when we did n't have stray dogs . 
  back during the 1980s , there were no stray dogs . 
  after ceau\u0219escu fell in 1989 , the people working for the local authorities stopped caring about anything other their personal profits . 
  actually , bono has been constantly defending the virtues of capitalism and talking about how africa `` needs more capitalism '' . 
  huygens , bernoulli , laplace and other famous ( and rather dead ) scientists are in there , writing articles during the 2000s . 
  also , s ( lobodan ) milosevic , r ( on ) jeremy , m ( ichael ) jackson , a. s. hole , supaporn , s. stiffmeister are all in the references . 
   the important thing is to be logical , not governed by morals this kind of thinking is why there 's so much warfare in the world . 
  i feel it 's like getting into a fist-fight and selling both parties guns and then saying it was the logical decision , because it was profitable for me and both parties wanted the guns to settle the dispute . 
   have we learned nothing from yugoslavia ? 
  have we learned nothing from iraq and afghanistan ? 
  together , these wars caused close to a million violent deaths . 
  ( rebels , westerners , and especially local civilians ), 
  `` partners '' meaning countries like those from the gulf like saudi arabia or [ qatar ] ( http://www.dw.de/germany-boosts-arms-exports-to-qatar/a-17004637 ) . 
  i do n't think that by selling weapons to saudi arabia ( a non-democratic country run by fundamentalists ) you 're helping the world peace . 
   at least try to stop wars germany is one of the world 's biggest weaponry exporters , most of which is high-tech weaponry . 
  would n't it be better for world peace to stop producing high-tech killing machines , rather than invading or bombing middle eastern countries ? 
   a party that wants to disband the nato and wants to end all foreign missions [ ... ] should not be a vital part of the government in my eyes . 
  why ? 
  indeed ... 
   of which culture you feel most close to : german , british or french ? 
  french . 
   in what country/culture would you feel most at home ? 
  italy . 
  influences : * greco-roman origins - ancient era * slavic influence - 7th-18th centuries * medieval german influence - 11th-15th centuries - in urban settlements across romania ( even early wallachian cities like t\u00e2rgovi\u0219te or c\u00e2mpulung were settled and organized by germans ) * hungarian influence - 11th-19th centuries * ottoman influence - 17th-18th centuries * modern greek influence - 1700s-1840s * french influence - 1820s-1980s * german influence - 1870s-1940s * soviet influence - 1940s-1980s * american influence - 1970s-now, 
   hahaha . 
  this is the first time i 've heard about mooing cows in bucharest . 
  you can also hear roosters early in the morning if you walk on polon\u0103 street in downtown bucharest . 
  also , there is quite a bit of difference between homophobia within the eu ( such as religious people saying that homosexuality is evil and they should repent ) and russia ( official sanctioned homophobia ; skinheads beating homosexuals on the street ) . 
  only for the nationalists , who blame the non-romanians for all the romania 's problems . 
  since many people mentioned ceau\u0219escu , here 's a brief history of the communist era : when the communists took over , romania had two worlds : a westernized urban elite and some very underdeveloped rural areas . 
  since 85 % of the people were peasants , we can say that the average was very bad , making romania one of the most underdeveloped countries in europe . 
  during the soviet occupation , almost anyone who was involved in pre-war politics , as well as much of the economic elite ( i.e. 
  landowners ) were sent to labour camps and many died there . 
  gheorghiu-dej was able to obtain the retreat of the soviet troops and then the political prisoners were freed . 
  the soviet union wanted romania to continue being an `` agricultural country '' , but the local leaders refused and started a `` forced industrialization '' , which worked quite well for several decades ( 1950s-1970s ) , turning romania from an agricultural country into an industrialized country . 
  ceau\u0219escu continued gheorghiu-dej 's policy of independence from the soviet union , most notably denouncing the invasion of czechoslovakia by warsaw pact countries . 
  during the early 1970s , life was quite good for most of the romanians ( despite having some obvious political police that did put some limits on the freedom of speech ) , but that was to change when ceau\u0219escu started his austerity policy in order to save money and build more and more huge and unprofitable industrial facilities . 
  while initially the us/western europe helped romania with loans and technology , eventually , the interest of the loans increased so much that ceau\u0219escu decided to pay everything back , at no matter what cost . 
  this decision was taken especially after imf conditioned some loans with changes in his policies . 
  the 1980s were full of shortages , more and more austerity and more and more useless investment in industrial capacities . 
   bffs with hungary , get a room already we have a love-hate relationship with them . 
  in transylvania , some romanians hate the hungarians even though they have some hungarian ancestry , while some hungarians hate the romanians even though they have some romanian ancestry .
