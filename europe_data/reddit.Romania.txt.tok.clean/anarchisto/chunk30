  i do n't know why this happens . 
  actually , plenty of people from transylvania have a mixed ancestry , my girlfriend included . 
  i see your point , but their languages ( cuman and crimean tatar ) were almost the same . 
  the differences were less than what are called `` dialects '' in most languages . 
  edit : i see wikipedia even claims that one of the dialects of [ crimean tatar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_tatar_language ) `` is a direct descendant of the cuman language '' . 
  some random tidbits about the romanian history : * romanians speak a curious language which is derived from latin , but it has many slavic loanwords and an albanic substratum . 
  * the grammar is very similar to albanian and bulgarian/macedonian , while also sharing some features with greek and serbo-croatian * romania was founded by the union of wallachia and moldavia in 1859 and transylvania was added after wwi * transylvania ( northeastern romania ) was conquered by the hungarians , but at least since the great mongol invasion ( 1241 ) , romanians have been the majority . 
  * wallachia ( southern romania ) was founded by a cuman ( who are some kind of tatars ) dynasty in 14th century , initially being a vassal of hungary * moldavia ( eastern romania ) was founded by a romanian warlord ( knyaz ) of maramure\u0219 ( north of transylvania ) , initially being a vassal of hungary, 
  not clever , but `` cunning '' . 
  that 's what the apparent etymology of his name means . 
   those are the yields for a 10 yr greek bond on the open market exactly . 
  if greece wants to sell bonds on the open market , they need to give the interest rate that the market wants . 
  before the eu/imf intervention , the only place to get money for greece was the open market , so they did pay this interest rate . 
  it went down after the eu intervention , now it 's just 10 % . 
  [ it was 20 % a year ago ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/gggb10yr:ind ) . 
  yes , if you buy 10-year greek bonds , you will get a 10 % interest rate , just hope they do n't get bankrupt by then . 
   when the crisis hit , greece 's debt started growing at a much higher rate than italy 's . 
  most of greece 's new debt after the crisis struck was due to high interest rate ( as high as 60 % ) for the existing debt . 
  greece need to borrow more just to pay the interest for the existing debt . 
  if the ecb would have intervened , there would have been no such interest rate and as such , little new debt . 
   lived on borrowed and eu money sorry to be so blunt , but you 're repeating propaganda . 
  before the crisis , greece 's debt levels have been more or less constant ( as percentage of gdp ) throughout the last two decades : * 1996 : 99.4 % * 2000 : 103 % * 2005 : 100 % -- * 2007 : 107 % * 2008 : 113 % * 2009 : 129 % * 2010 : 148 % * 2011 : 170 % up until 2007 , greece had a lower debt percentage of gdp than italy . 
  italy was saved by the ecb , greece was not , because it 's not `` too big to fail '' . 
   but in 2019 they will have a productivity that rivals the dutch ? 
  how ? 
  the greeks never had the living standards of the dutch , so they 're not asking for that . 
  so far everything was surprisingly calm . 
  no violence involving the riot police , no destruction of property . 
  it 's not the same scale : those were a dozen conspiracy theorists . 
  these are tens of thousands people . 
  you may not be able to be in the eurozone , to affect the decisions taken in there . 
  actually , that does n't really matter , as you 're going to be a small country and still germany and france will decide everything . 
  however , you can still use physically the euro unilaterally , like montenegro and kosovo . 
  indeed . 
  and i 'm making a link to that subreddit just to get some karma : / r/askhistorians, 
  a small historical tidbit : for a long time ( until 2009 ) , liechtenstein did n't recognize either the czech republic or slovakia because after wwii , the czechoslovaks confiscated the lichtenstein ruling dynasty 's huge domains in the country ( about 1,600 km \u00b2 , ten times more than lichtenstein 's area ) . 
  the czech and slovaks refused to return them because of the collaboration between liechtenstein and the nazis during the german occupation of czechoslovakia during wwii . 
  typically , that 's done by using [ bear-proof rubbish bins ] ( http://www.bearicuda.com/critter-can/bear_proof_garbage.php ) . 
  actually , the city of bra\u0219ov ( which has a bear problem , as they come down into the city in order to eat from the rubbish bins ) has very few stray dogs . 
  i 'm not sure if this is related . 
   when appropriating a neighbour 's history and culture [ ... ] how `` alexander is our history '' so you think you 've got some kind of a copyright on the region 's history ? 
  it 's their history , too , as the republic of macedonia is within the borders of the historical region of macedonia . 
   your country is populated by slavic races that had absolutely nothing to do with ancient greece do you think that there is such a thing as a slavic race ? 
  that 's the 19th century racial theory and it has been proven false by modern genetics . 
  people who live side-by-side share their genes : the difference between a greek macedonian and a slavic macedonian is just the language they speak . 
  northern greeks have some slavic ancestry and slavic macedonians have ancient greek genes . 
  no , because moldovans speak the same language with us , so we do n't consider them as not being real moldavians . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's a superiority complex or an inferiority complex . 
  probably a bit of both . 
   i was involved almost several years ago in the great macedonian war on english wikipedia , trying to get some sanity in there . 
  the greek wikipedians insisted that every page that used `` republic of macedonia '' or `` macedonian ( s ) '' to have a rather long disclaimer telling about how wikipedia does n't support the macedonians claims to be macedonians , or the name of `` republic of macedonia '' instead of fyrom . 
  * fopog ( former ottoman pa\u015fal\u0131k of greece ) is annoyed by the name of macedonia ( even though the country does contain parts of the ancient province of macedonia ) , so the country is occasionally known as `` fyrom '' ( `` former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' ) . 
  * greece was also annoyed by [ their flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_republic_of_macedonia_1992-1995.svg ) ( based on alexander 's vergina sun ) , so macedonians had to change this as well .

  also , soros , who is both a hungarian and a jew ( double conspiracy points ) , is trying to do something nasty to us !, 
   there are sympathisers of catalan separatism in valencia and the balearics , but a majority of the population ( a very large majority in valencia ) are hostile . 
  in a bus in mallorca , i witnessed a political discussion between a very militant catalanist elderly lady ( in her 70s , speaking catalan ) and a middle age guy ( speaking castilian ) who wanted to remain with spain . 
  the elderly lady said that everyone in her family considers themselves catalan and she was quite informed in the arguments for independence . 
  quite entertaining , especially the way they each spoke their own language . 
  same for us , romanians with the hungarians . 
  still a lot of idiots ( on both sides ) who love a bit of conflict . 
  the romanians will bring some , too , but at the same time we 'll argue we 're not balkanians . 
  there are enough resources to end poverty . 
  there is no political will to end poverty , but it is not impossible . 
  these changes are happening across the developed world as software is replacing people and the market itself ca n't create enough new kinds of jobs to replace those lost to technology . 
  unfortunately , everyone is talking about the effects and no one has a clue about how to solve the problem .

  how funny that impurities are found in wines only when the relationships with other ex-ussr countries sour . 
  same thing happened to georgia in 2006 : [ they found impurities in georgian wines and mineral waters ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4976304.stm ) . 
  there were reasons why greece was thought by the `` markets '' of being the weakest link in the eurozone . 
  widespread corruption and keeping a high debt ( to foreigners ! ), 
  even throughout the booming period were mistakes on their part . 
  but the same crisis is happening in spain , which is not as corrupt and it had very little debt before the crisis , but it was simply thought by the markets as being `` weak '' due to its structure of the economy , or ireland , due to its bank problems . 
  no , it was n't a bubble because its economy was quite solid and diverse . 
  tourism , industry , services , constructions , mining , agriculture etc. 
  a rather healthy mix . 
  the problem was definitely not in the structure of the economy . 
  however , the greek economy had an achilles ' heel : it had a high debt as percentage of gdp and this debt was owed to foreigners . 
  other countries , like japan , have much more higher debt levels than greece , but the debt is owed to their own people , who will not try to get rid of it . 
  of course it 's easy to find faults in the greek administration ( and that would be correct ) , but the truth is that the downfall of the greek economy was caused by austerity , which was a natural response to the rise in interest rates ( reaching a peak of 39 % in 2012 ) , which were due to investment banks thinking that greece is the weakest link of the eurozone . 
  basically , the downfall happened because bankers thought it will happen . 
  a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  the string quartet also played [ metallica ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwui7-0uiok ) . 
  probably the part of happiness that is not explained by any reasons ( financial , social , freedom , healthy life , etc. ) . 
  for instance , mexicans are happy , but they do n't have that many reasons to be . 
  we have the same joke in romania and we also castrate them and release them . 
   i do n't believe he 's still in the social-democrat party . 
  dragnea , a psd leader , after n\u0103stase 's conviction : [ `` the social-democratic party does n't dissociate from adrian n\u0103stase ; the n\u0103stase era is not over '' ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/dragnea-psd-nu-se-disociaza-de-adrian-nastase-era-nastase-nu-s-a-terminat-9778190 ) . 
  based on what mainstream politicians say , it seems they 're afraid that protests would continue to escalate , so this concession is meant to let the steam off the movement before people voice other demands . 
  a big concern is the fact that the protesters oppose all current political class due to its corruption and they might request some different system to deal with the omnipresent corruption . 
  for instance , social-democratic leader and former prime-minister n\u0103stase ( who spent last year in prison after being convicted for corruption ) said that it 's `` not a good thing to let alternative politics [ literally `` antisystem mechanisms '' ] gain a foothold in the country '' .

  not hard to pronounce by any standards , so that is wrong . 
  westerners could have used the old celtic name , serdica , from which the slavic name is derived . 
   they do n't like the russians .
