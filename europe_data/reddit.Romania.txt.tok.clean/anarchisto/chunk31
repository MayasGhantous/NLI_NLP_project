  last time i went through bulgaria , i saw some communist-era murals about their friendship with the russians . 
  i 'm not sure if they exist anymore , but it 's certain that there was no such thing in romania after the soviet troops left in 1950s . 
  orpheus was a greek mythological being , but the greeks believed he was a thracian . 
  another famous thracian was spartacus . 
  ... which means that their pharmaceutical research is or was pretty good , too . 
  they do the same in some parts of romania ; this is the case of the village where my grandmother was born ( in arge\u0219 county ) . 
  bulgarians are bulgarian-speaking romanians and romanians are romanian-speaking bulgarians . 
  we might not want to admit it , but we 're way too similar in almost everything : * folklore and ethnography ; for instance , folk costumes : [ southern romanian ] ( http://www.interfolk.co.uk/bride/costumes/rom.jpg ) vs. [ bulgarian ] ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3133/2558965970_49aebed7f5_z.jpg ) * traditions : for instance m\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or / martenitsa , giving on march 1st a small amulet with a white and red yearn ; or paparuda/peperuda , a rainmaking ritual during draught , etc * in virtually every international statistics , romania and bulgaria are very close , like twins . 
  for instance , the hdi : romania is # 56 ( 0.786 ) , bulgaria is # 57 ( 0.782 ) . 
  * the stray dogs , which occasionally kill someone : [ bulgaria ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5gefn3gl2yg53ptb5zwrodlgc6mfw?docid=cng.0aed8735d1342bd2d8ddc08ead1bdb9b.491 ) , [ romania ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/stray-dogs-kill-4-year-old-boy-near-park-in-romanian-capital/article14070160/ ), 
  and the romanian government blacked out a pdf by adding a black box over the censored parts . 
   the best way to save the mountains would be if hoards tourists made a point of visiting . 
  the problem is that , in order to prevent tourism from developing , the town was declared by the local authorities as a `` monoindustrial zone '' , so no businesses are given any permit , unless they 're in the mining industry . 
  the authorities tried the best to keep the locals poor and unemployed , because otherwise , they would n't want the mine to be built . 
   the `` piata universitatii '' protests turned really ugly and really violent yes , the protesters fought back against the police which used violence to try to evict them from the square . 
  but even this does n't excuse president iliescu 's decision to send the former securitate people to direct some civilians to repress other civilians , leading to a few dozen deaths . 
   as for their demands , those were the invalidation of a pretty democratic election the 1990 elections were not fair because the ruling party controlled all the state-owned media ( including all the tv and radio stations ) and was able to use it for propaganda . 
  fair elections require a fair access to the media . 
  ** the people ** the protesters are an ecclectic mix of young people : the kind of people who have never been to a protest . 
  virtually all are young ( students , activists , intellectuals , professionals working for large corporations ) and most organized through [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/events/438390812941856/442813669166237/ ) / twitter/reddit/etc , so i guess this makes it the first real `` internet-era '' protest in romania . 
  a friend who was in taksim , istanbul protests a few months ago says that it has the university square has same feeling . 
  my father said that a generation ago , the same kind of people protested in 1990 , soon after the fall of ceau\u0219escu , in the same square , but it was violently repressed by president iliescu . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golaniad ) ** the ideology ** they do n't have just one ideology . 
  there were people from the extreme-left '' [ down with capitalism ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lm4pr14h.jpg ) '' to the extreme-right ( half a dozen people wearing traditional romanian shirts and a [ codreanu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codreanu ) pin ) . 
  what they had in common however is the contempt of mainstream politics . 
  `` social-democrats [ left-wing ] and democratic-liberals [ right-wing ] / the same squalor '' ( it kinda rhymes in romanian ) being one of the slogans . 
  what is their solution ? 
  i do n't know and they do n't either , yet . 
   one of their chanted slogans was `` solidarity '' / `` international solidarity '' . 
  that 's what we lacked the last decade , indeed . 
  ** the media ** much of the mainstream media had a complete blackout on the protests : for instance , the antena 1 and prima tv stations had not mentioned them in their news , while the state-owned tvr had just one 43-second clip about it the whole day . 
  also , the tv stations which did cover the event generally had a hostile view . 
  the tv and print had for the last two years had ** a lot ** of ads for ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 gold corporation ( in order to swing the popular support for the project ) and allegedly , ( a friend of a friend claimed this ) the contracts signed disallowed the tv stations from criticising the company for 3 years , so that might explain their self-censorship . 
  ** the gold and politics ** the gold and silver is worth at least $ 14 billion and from what i read , there are precious and semi-precious metals that are worth even more , so it 's a lot of money involved . 
  since it 's a lot of money , they were able to buy every party and almost every politician . 
  the politicians , when in opposition ( regardless of political colour ) , oppose the project in order to attract votes , since most romanians oppose it . 
  but as soon as they 're in power , they support it . 
  the social-democrats ( now in power ) even put stopping the project in their electoral programme , but they changed their mind as soon as they got in power ( and presumably , new bribes ) . 
  the best explanation of the project and its relationship with the politicians is found in a romanian-language deutsche welle editorial ( since the romanian press avoids the topic ) :  `` the mining project practiced bribery through professional and systematically-applied methods '' [ source ] ( http://www.dw.de/capitalism-vs-moral\u0103/a-17051948 ) ** authorities ' response ** so far , the gendarmes behaved in a civilized manner and , from what i heard , there were no problems at all . 
  this is unlikely the january 2012 protests that eventually brought out the democratic-liberal ( right-wing ) government , in which the gendarmes tried to disperse the protesters . 
  [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_romanian_protests ) but then , those people were `` the mob '' , the poor affected by austerity and these people are slightly better at negociating with the gendarmes . 
  ** what will happen ? 
  ** the protesters say they 'll continue protesting until the project is canceled . 
  the government did n't back up , yet , they still think the people will go away . 
  tonight is just the second evening of protests , so it 's still early to say , but they started putting tents just like in taskim . 
  so you think that the fightings between various factions ( and often with foreign interventions ) in afghanistan , iraq , mali , somalia , yemen , syria , etc do n't really happen , right ? 
  syria alone has around 2 million refugees which fled the country . 
  also , are n't you an economic migrant as well , moving from romania to sweden ? 
  we have articles about society problems from other european countries as well . 
  there are lots of things `` wrong '' with this project , apart from the obvious reasons : turning [ seven mountains which look like this ] ( http://turismrosia.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/90.jpg ) into [ something like this ] ( http://thealternative.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/85349_137454.jpg ) and using cyaniades for separating the gold , which may result in water supply pollution . 
  * there are local residents who do n't want to move . 
  the mining company will be given free hand to expropriate whoever they want , by-passing the courts . 
  the government will hand them any property they want within 45 days . 
  this is definitely against the romanian constitution and all property protection laws . 
  * there are about two dozen things that by-pass different laws , especially related to the use of courts and many exceptions to the environmental protection laws . 
  * there 's the corruption issue : before the 2012 electoral campaign , the social-democrats claimed that the gold project was approved only because the then-government ( democrat-liberals ) received bribes from the canadian mining firm . 
  his wife , an mp , claimed she 'd chain herself there to prevent the bulldozers from razing the town . 
  now both of them are great supporters of the project . 
  i guess the company was able to `` buy all politicians '' afterall . 
  * most of the profits will go to canada and the locals will get almost nothing . 
  900 minimum-wage jobs ( 150 $ / month ) are n't going to enrich them , but they 'll lose any chance to do agriculture or tourism in the area , so it 's a short-term job vs. long-term unemployment * ** all ** the press was bought out by the company . 
  there is no article published in the mainstream press that is critical of the project . 
  there have been even articles that were mildly critical of the company that were taken down from the websites of the newspapers after the company intervened ... * the romanians are overwhelmingly against the project , which aroused passions from a wide-range of people ( not just the hippies and tree-huggers ) , like no other issue in the last 20 years . 
  well , germany is now running its db as a commercial enterprise , not as a public service . 
  the result is that germans are paying huge tickets prices , the db is getting a profit , which it uses to buy up transportation companies across europe . 
   just curious , do you have direct knowledge about this ? 
  yup , my father worked as an engineer . 
   because i was doing internships in such `` state of the art '' factories back then , and in a field where you need to retool every 2 years to stay afloat , those ` hi-tech ' factories were about 10 years outdated . 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  retooling every 2 years ? 
  apart from micro-chips , i do n't know any other field which has such fast advances . 
  and yes , the computers built by romania in the 1980s ( and the eastern bloc and to a large degree even western europe ) were no match for what the us had at the time . 
  and even in the west , `` 10 years old technology '' is still new in most industries . 
  no , it 's easy-to-extract convention land-based oil . 
  and also , a system of gas stations , a few chemical factories and oil refineries . 
  well , it does n't matter . 
  the result was that the controlling shares in a company that has $ 20 billion worth of oil were sold for $ 700 million , less than the [ profit it currently has ] ( http://www.bvb.ro/listedcompanies/securitydetail.aspx?s=snp&amp;t=2 ) each year . 
  if everything was fair , i 'm sure that many other companies would have much paid more for it . 
  but it was an auction of bribes and austrian omv was willing to pay the highest bribe . 
   otoh , the privatise everything has been a roaring success . 
  speaking of privatizing trains , i need to remind you how well it worked in sweden : it failed so bad that the state had to nationalize back the rail system in the 1990s . 
   because no interested buyers showed up . 
  you mean that no other corporations were willing to pay a higher bribe . 
   this said once the catch up is done corruption and backwards education and social systems do become a problem , this was the case for romania as well . 
  sorry , but i feel some unwarranted smugness . 
  what `` backwards education and social system '' ? 
  the romanian education system worked quite well , it produced a generation of intellectuals and engineers that was similar in skills to what the universities in the west had . 
   alot of those industires were closed down due to being part of a completely failed economic and social system . 
  the produce of those factories was definitely inferior , but that does n't mean that the people who designed them were worse engineers than those in the west , it 's simply that they had to deal with lack of technology , shortages of materials and ideological party directives . 
  let me give you an example : copper shortage -- romania had limited copper reserves and it had to import it for hard currency . 
  the party made mandatory that all factories to reduce copper usage , so their engineers were forced to create a product using an inferior metal ( aluminium ) instead of copper . 
  it was stupid that sometimes the costs of this would be higher than the actual cost of copper . 
  this is a leadership failure , but it does n't mean that the whole factories were useless . 
   the interconnectedness of the massive warsaw-pact command industries meant that if one country did fall the others would follow suit actually , you are slightly wrong about this . 
  romania tried to `` liberate '' itself from the warsaw pact and this is why it tried to export to south america , africa , asia and even the capitalist west . 
  in some more sensitive areas ( such as computers ) , it had to import technology from the soviet union and friendly european countries like france , since the us had an embargo , but overall , romania got its technology from the west . 
   you would n't have the money to support all those inefficient factories . 
  it 's easy to say they 're `` inefficient '' if you do n't know more about them . 
  quite a few of them had state-of-the-art equipment , such as numerical control machine tools bought from japan or france . 
   whatever was privatized was in such a bad state that the privatization did n't raise much interest among investors the natural resources were in bad state ?
