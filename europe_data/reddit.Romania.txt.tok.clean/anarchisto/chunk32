  for instance , oil . 
  the national oil company has reserves worth probably 20-30 billion $ and it the majority of shares were sold for $ 750 million . 
  now it has ** yearly ** profit of 1 billion $ . 
   the debt has been at the same level for more than 10 years . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  [ see data from eurostat ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:ro:pl#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:ro&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false )  i do n't know how to interpret this since it contradicts your previous statement . 
  `` median '' and `` average '' are two very different things . 
  if you have 10 people with 100 $ and 1 person with 3000 $ , the median is 100 $ , while the average is 363 $ . 
  or corporations using double-irish/dutch sandwiches , do n't forget them . 
   so far greek banks have already received recapitalization about $ 40.9 billion out of an allocated $ 50 billion . 
  indeed , there was a bank bailout as well . 
  but why should the greek people suffer for the mishaps of the banks ? 
  maybe we stole it from you . 
  it was n't and of course reforms were needed , but i do n't think `` closing down all industry '' is a reform . 
  what destabilized romania in the first place was ceau\u0219escu 's [ 1980s austerity policy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_austerity_policy_in_romania ) . 
  during the 1960s and 1970s , romania 's economy grew very fast and it brought romania from a country that had a near-medieval quality-of-life to a reasonably modern country . 
  but starting with mid-1970s , ceau\u0219escu wanted a bigger and bigger share of romania 's gdp to be invested in those factories that were closed down after 1990 . 
  initially , he did the investment using foreign loans , then he got imf involved , then he wanted to repay everything , while keeping the investment high , at the cost of the standard of living ... 
   germany did not create any of these problems , when german ( and french and swedish , etc ) corporations are bribing greek ( or romanian , or bulgarian , or slovenian , etc ) politicians , is it not those corporations ' fault also ? 
  i keep getting the response that this is capitalism and it 's not the germans ' fault . 
  really ? 
  corruption is just a feature of capitalism ? 
   and are actually paying real money to keep economies afloat that else would drown . 
  actually , the loaned money ends up in the coffers of the german/french banks . 
  greece has a primary fiscal surplus ( i.e. 
  before interest payments ) , but it must get more and more loans just to be able to keep up paying the interest rates . 
   why were they closed ? 
  because it 's easier to buy a company , sell all its equipment and real-estate , take the profit and flee to a country where they do n't extradite to romania , than it is to run a business . 
  also , occasionally , the buyer was a big multinational which just wanted to make sure that the factory was not bought by a competitor . 
   i suspect corporatism , aka corruption here . 
  why else should a government give valuable resources away for nothing ? 
  of course . 
   also austerity in combination with structural reforms bring a country back on it 's feet throughout the 1990s and 2000s , romania followed the structural reforms that the imf and eu recommended , the so-called `` structural reforms '' : * privatization of all factories , around 95 % of them were closed down , leading to millions of fewer jobs . 
  ( compared to 1990 , we probably have about half the number of jobs ) . 
  * privatization ( by privatization i mean giving away ) of natural resources , billions of profits from oil and other resources now are going away to western corporations every year * privatization of water , which is now 5 times more expensive than before , same for electricity , gas , etc. 
  * privatization of banks , then getting an imf loan to bail-out those private banks due to bad loans during the real estate boom * removing of subsidies , which resulted in further losses of jobs * trade liberalization with the eu , now over half of our food is imported . 
  * economic exile for three to four millions of romanians who ca n't find a job here . 
  * from a 0 % debt in 1990 , we reached a debt of 40 % of the gdp and now growing fast . 
  * minimum wage = 160 $ / month ( gross ) ; median wage = 220 $ / month -- the purchasing power of the median wage is lower than it was in 1990 . 
  the purchasing power of the average wage is up 19 % ( according to the national statistics institute ) but yeah , i guess it 's our fault . 
  we did n't do follow the instructions correctly . 
  in romanian , we have a saying that might apply here : `` having to choose between plague and cholera '' . 
  this is what i feel on election day . 
  it 's obvious that the thatcherists ' policies ( angela merkel 's included ) will lead just to more inequality , but the left either has no vision for the future or no courage to do anything ( look at hollande ) , so they 're just applying slow-motion thatcherism . 
   plus , romania does n't have billions upon billions of euros in debt and bailouts . 
  [ yes , it does .

  no , it wo n't .

  the video conference equipment did n't work ; switching it on and off did n't do anything . 
  a norwegian co-worker proposed to try the `` swedish on/off switch '' , i.e. 
  unplugging it and plugging it again . 
  what do you do with the donkeys ? 
  do they become british lasagna like our horses ? 
  they did have some better ones a while ago , but it did n't work out great . 
   why have you chosen to elect corrupt and bad ones ? 
  because our electoral system wo n't allow us to elect good ones . 
  for corruption , there are two parts . 
  why is it only our fault for electing corrupt politicians and not your fault , too , because your companies come here and bribe our politicians ? 
  for instance , [ paid bribes to the romanian government in exchange of contracts ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/48030/20130521/ ) . 
  it has to do with the imf which is probably the most important institution of international capitalism . 
  for instance , they just told us to privatize the hydro and nuclear plants , the post offices and the railroads . 
  we ca n't not do that . 
  if we do n't do what the imf says , we 'll default and become like greece , it 's as simple as that . 
  where 's the democracy in that ? 
  it 's not our government who decides what to do , it 's the imf . 
  i am not a communist ( at least not a marxist and certainly not a leninist ) , and i 'm not defending north korea , stalin , ceau\u0219escu or whoever , you 're just putting words in my mouth . 
   we will forget the horrible autrocities , deaths , oppression , discrimination and dictatorship that the communistic states practises what about the horrible autrocities , deaths , oppression , discrimination and dictatorship that the capitalist states ? 
  the apartheid , belgian congo , the holocaust , pinochet , the iraq war , etc. 
   i most certainly live in a democracy i also live in a `` democracy '' . 
  i have to choose between two parties whose policies are almost identical and contrary to the interest of the people . 
  theoretically , the rule of law applies here , except for when it affects the financial interests . 
  then , the rule of law is discouraged by imf or whoever is watching us . 
  do you want an example ? 
  sure : most mortgage contracts in romania include some clauses that are illegal according to both european and romanian law . 
  they have been found illegal by the justice system and the justice system wanted to remove them from all contracts between banks and consumers in order to prevent a hundred thousand different trials to take place . 
  the imf and national bank intervened and they said that if the `` abusive clauses '' ( as they were deemed by the justice ) were to be removed , the banks would lose some money and the investors will be afraid to invest here . 
  so , they were not removed . 
  if you want to get the clause removed , you have to spend two or three years fighting the banks and you 'll win . 
  and every country that turns capitalist becomes a dictatorship of the financial sector sooner or later . 
  blaming communism for stalin 's murders is like blaming capitalism for hitler 's murders . 
  not even cuba traps people inside anymore : http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/10/16/cuba-allows-citizens-to-travel-mostly-freely-for-first-time-in-51-years/  havana , cuba -- the cuban government announced tuesday it will eliminate a half-century-old restriction that requires citizens to get an exit visa to leave the country . 
  i guess the only country remaining is north korea . 
  yes , the eu had some directives and we 're going to be fined , but it 's not like the politicians are going to pay the fine from their pockets , it 's the taxpayers who are going to pay the fine . 
   as a ( pardon me please ) somewhat backward place but this is just shocking . 
  this is not as shocking as the fact that 42 % of the population ( which is 90 % of the rural population ) has no flushing toilet . 
  ( [ according to eurostat , 2009 , page 4 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-sf-11-004/en/ks-sf-11-004-en.pdf ) ), 
  in romania , we do n't even have municipal waste collection in every village . 
  in some villages they still throw their trash or in the forest or in the river ( leading to extremely polluted river banks downstream ) . 
  probably until 5 years ago , almost no village had any municipal waste collection , but lately infrastructure has been built with eu funds . 
  regarding recycling , in the last couple of years , recycling bins popped up in bucharest ( and presumably other big cities ) , but many of them are full of mixed trash and then taken by regular garbage trucks and taken to the landfill ... 
   comparing poland to bulgaria is like comparing norway to spain . 
  norway and spain are too different to be a fair comparison . 
  more like comparing france to spain . 
  different in some ways , similar in others . 
  he talks about the cult of personality that grew around de gaulle , which envisioned him as a quasi-mystical savior of france . 
  probably the hotel is in the transylvanian town where vlad was born ( sighi\u0219oara ) . 
  the key point here is that it 's not part of the european union customs union ( which includes the uk as well ) .
