  this means that they can import things without paying the european union duties . 
  these goods can then be smuggled into the union . 
  but then no one would recognize him .

  * lakes , forests and awesome nature .

  romanian : `` non-stop '' means `` open 24/7 '' . 
  back when we were invading the ussr together . 
  let 's try it . 
  do you have a bear handy ? 
  you can also take a piece of clothing off , leave it behind and the bear will stop to smell it . 
   both killed by tame wolves . 
  so , perhaps one should avoid petting them . 
  sigh . 
  once in a while we have another tourist who is killed by a bear after trying to interact with it . 
  bears may seem cute , soft and slow , but they 're not teddy-bears , they 're half-a-ton beasts with sharp claws and who can run faster than you . 
  you do n't want to get close to them or annoy them . 
  when you see bears , you should try to go the other way ( they wo n't follow you ) , not to go close to them to take photos . 
  a couple of years ago , a group of tourists even went near a bear and they used flash to take the photos , which annoyed the bear who attacked and killed an american tourist . 
  also , if a bear gets aggressive ( because of the tourists who get near him to take photos ) , you do n't start throwing rocks at him . 
  that will annoy him even more . 
  ( this also happened ) . 
  the essence of international sports bodies ( fifa , uefa , olympic committee , etc ) is corruption ; the essence of sport itself is doping . 
  well , the russian government , just like the us government , acts like an empire and empires are supposed to be feared , not liked . 
  but the russians ( perhaps except some of the * nouveaux riches * ) are likeable and great people . 
  i support helping the poor , if it actually helps them , not just give some money to corrupt businessmen in poor areas , which is the way such things are currently done ... 
   at least for transylvania , we know that it 's really bad as it is right now since most of our tax money and resources go to bucharest for them to distribute them to poorer regions not `` most of our money '' ; most of it returns to transylvania , which also has its share of poor areas ( s\u0103laj , harghita , covasna , etc ) . 
  the area which is probably most disadvantaged by the current arrangement is bucharest/ilfov , which , being the most developed , gets far less money than it pays in taxes . 
  they should at least deprive him of his military pension . 
  he probably gets around 1500 $ / month , in a country where the average pension is 100 $ / month and the median wage is 250 $ / month . 
  similarly , all the securitate bosses get these absurdly high `` special '' pensions , while the people they tortured get those small regular pensions . 
  imo , they should remove all special pensions . 
  everyone should get proportional to what they contributed . 
  the military , police and securitate people would get 100-200 $ / month instead of 1000-2000 $ / month they get now . 
  indeed . 
  according to pintprice.com , beer costs : * stockholm : [ $ 5.75 ] ( http://www.pintprice.com/city.php?/stockholm/sweden/gbp.htm ) * london : [ $ 4.14 ] ( http://www.pintprice.com/city.php?/london/united%20kingdom/ ) eastern europe is much cheaper than both : * bucharest : [ $ 1.38 ] ( http://www.pintprice.com/city.php?/bucharest/romania/eur.htm ) * prague : [ $ 1.15 ] ( http://www.pintprice.com/city.php?/prague/czech%20republic/eur.htm ) * kiev : [ $ 0.86 ] ( http://www.pintprice.com/city.php?/kiev/ukraine/eur.htm ), 
  petrol prices , retail prices ( including vat , fuel taxes , etc ) : * sweden : $ 1.672 * uk : $ 1.592 both are high , when compared to : * spain : $ 1.479 * austria : $ 1.441 * poland : $ 1.332 -- tobacco , as of 2011 : http://www.the-tma.org.uk/tma-publications-research/facts-figures/eu-cigarette-prices/ * uk : # 6.95 / pack * sweden : # 5.71, 
   there is no shortage of things people can be doing . 
  many of the things that can be done ( and would improve a lot the people 's quality of life ) are things that are not profitable enough for the private sector to do on its own . 
  the solution would be that the very productive sectors to subsidize the less productive sectors , but in this era of `` minimal state '' and austerity , that 's not going to happen . 
   i feel a lot of us sometimes bash the u.s quite a bit . 
  europeans/south americans bash the us government . 
  people are people everywhere . 
  homelessness is a serious problem in eastern europe because we do n't have a working welfare system . 
  in romania , theoretically , anyone without a job can get welfare benefits worth 25 $ / month , but that 's not enough for food , let alone for renting a place . 
  also , the bureaucracy makes it sure that it 's almost impossible to get it if you do n't have a registered residence . 
  some smaller towns have some kind of social housing , but the big cities ( including bucharest ) have no such thing . 
  from what i read , the homeless people are either : * orphans who were kicked out of the orphanages after reaching the age of 18 * children running away from abusive alcoholic parents in the countryside * divorced working-class men with no place to stay after getting kicked out by their spouse * middle-class ( almost always childless ) elderly people who got their house illegally taken away from them * people with various mental illnesses gangs often use them to force them to beg , so unfortunately , if you give money to an elderly beggar , they 'd not use them , but they 'll get to some underworld boss . 
  the invisible hand of the market says that 's what it 's worth . 
  wallachia was founded by some cumans who were turkic people had some mongol ancestry as well , but they were assimilated into the romanian population . 
   hungarians are members of the glorious mongoloid race . 
  except that genetically , the hungarians share most of their genes with their european neighbours , not with the asian people . 
  there was a small group of warriors which conquered pannonia and , in time , assimilated the people living there ( germanic , slavic , latin ) , imposing their language on them . 
  a lot of people have some hungarian ancestry even here in bucharest , and i guess that the percentage is much higher in transylvania . 
  my girlfriend is partly hungarian ( here great-grandparents were born in salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n , hungary ) , so if she learns hungarian , she 'd be eligible to get hungarian citizenship . 
   people still visit versailles even though the french monarchs are not there and i remember having read that it receives more visits than its british counterparts that 's because most of the buckingham palace is off-limits for tourists because it 's still in use . 
   republic here does n't work well ( never did ) so i rather have a monarch . 
  a monarch doing what ? 
  across europe , the monarch does not have any power . 
   more and more people here lean towards the idea of returning to monarchy . 
  more and more people here lean towards the idea of returning to the times of vlad the impaler . 
   brings in a shitload of tourism money of course , people go to britain to see the queen , not london , which was the most important city in the world for a century or the british museum , which has the most important archaeological collections in the world . 
  relics from a by-gone era . 
  they could be easily replaced with socialites , like the us did . 
  who needs princesses when you have paris hilton ? 
  the most common argument for monarchy i see nowadays is that they bring tourism revenue . 
  i 'd argue that the french tourism is doing great even after they guillotined their kings . 
  the royal families appear to use a lot of time to do their `` hobbies '' : from killing elephants and pregnant bears ( juan carlos i of spain ) to partying ( [ harry the nazi ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4170083.stm ) ) . 
  i 'd not comment what they do with their free time if they were not paid millions to do that . 
  downvotes ? 
  :( such is life . 
  the reforms of the `` pro-reform prince '' ( cuza ) upset the boyars , hence the `` monstrous coalition '' of liberals and conservatives which replaced him with a conservative king who was willing to preserve their privileges . 
  the boyar mps agreed with his early reforms which modernized romania ( including a limited land reform using the lands confiscated from the church ) , but they could n't accept any serious land reform that would have redistributed part of the boyars ' land to the landless peasants . 
  if ( s ) he 's not a bavarian , there are chances of liking jokes . 
  it was a leopoldan period . 
  i would n't say it was a shameful moment for the whole country , since the decision was taken by just a few people ( iliescu & friends ) and carried out in secret . 
   one that first comes to my mind is that the neocommies that took power is this your definition of communist :  ** communist ** n . a person who is held to be mean or disagreeable . 
  because those people you call `` neo-communists '' are the guys who privatized everything after 1990 . 
  were n't communists supposed to nationalize rather than privatize things ? 
  apart from the szekler land and some small strip along the border , most of those hungarians who lived in transylvania lived in cities surrounding by a countryside with a romanian population majority . 
  and in this era , there is no such thing as `` historical right '' to a territory . 
  the romanians were the majority there and they wanted to become part of romania . 
  the borders were not fair , indeed , the oradea - satu mare section was made this way to include the railway between the two cities on a safe distance from the hungarian border . 
  but this was probably less than 10 % of the territory . 
  the treaty of trianon gave slovakia to its slovak majority , croatia to the croat majority and transylvania to the romanian majority . 
  why was it shameful ? 
  the massacres of jewish civilians ( including women and children ) : the [ ia\u0219i pogrom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ia\u0219i_pogrom ) and the [ odessa massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_odessa_massacre ) ( 1941 ) , while allied with hitler . 
  when i speak to an israeli , i feel like i 'm speaking to a central/eastern european . 
  the cultural tidbits , the humor , everything feels closer to our eastern european culture than the western european culture feels like . 
  if you claim that there is just one european culture/civilization ( which i tend to agree ) , then the israelis must be part of it . 
  culturally ( also through descent , at least partially ) , they are europeans , just like cypriots . 
  germany did n't benefit from it . 
  you can argue that german companies and the german top 1 % benefited from this , together with companies from the rest of developed countries , but the german people ? 
  they did n't get anything .
