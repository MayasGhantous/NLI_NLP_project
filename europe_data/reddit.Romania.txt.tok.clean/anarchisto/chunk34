   how did such a situation happen ? 
  when the eastern european countries moved into a market economy , the people lacked the `` antibodies '' and all kinds of villains reached the top . 
  state-owned companies and utilities were run by people who wanted to syphon as much money out of them as possible . 
  since these companies were losing money , the imf , eu , world bank , us , etc. 
  suggested privatization as a panacea . 
  the privatizations were usually done ( and they 're still done , currently , they 're privatizing hydro and nuclear plants and railroads ) in unfair ways so that someone will win . 
  since it 's usually a western company that paid the highest bribe ( i suppose that 's the auction ) , none of those institutions ( imf , eu , etc ) protested ; they just vaguely claimed that romania must do something with its corruption . 
   i 'm beginning to think that it is important to have a core export base and attempt to create an environment where as many other industries can ` feed ' off it as possible . 
  that 's what the norwegians do . 
  ( i 'm working for a norwegian it company here in romania ), 
  what ? 
  that romtelecom was sold for $ 675 million ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.zf.ro/wikizf/romtelecom-s-a-8134495 ) that installed 10.000 km of optical fiber cable before its sell-off ? 
  there have been plenty of very similar deals , like the telecom company being sold for $ 675 million right after the state paid for a nation-wide $ 1 billion optic cable network for it . 
  then there 's a whole series of utilities , starting with water , electricity , gas distribution that were practically given away . 
  during the 1990s , there were hundreds of factories given away to `` strategic investors '' for $ 1 , who then fired all the employees and took all the equipment out of the country and sold the real estate . 
  the locals ? 
  they know of corruption , but they 're too busy trying to survive ... 
  i meant a disorganized default , not a voluntary agreement of the creditors to make a `` haircut '' . 
  i can provide the examples of privatizations in romania : the majority of shares of the oil company ( including with gas stations , oil reserves , home and abroad , etc ) were sold for 0.7 billion $ to foreign investors . 
  its yearly profit is around 1 billion $ . 
  what lies ? 
  i keep looking at my post and i ca n't see anything that can be considered a lie . 
  the figures are correct and the latest , the 10-year bond is from [ bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/gggb10yr:ind ) . 
   first , there is [ 1 ] no way in hell greece can become competitive wrt germany and co by wage depression . 
  of course . 
  if you could become competitive by wage depression , then there 'd be no unemployed people willing to work for 150 $ / month in romania . 
   how is that supposed to fix the greek economy ? 
  the point is not to fix the greek economy , but to get some nice profits for europe 's economic elite , who can grab the privatized enterprises at a fraction of their real value . 
  nevertheless , the debt ( as percentage of gdp ) keeps growing and growing . 
  soon , the interest payments will be too high and it will lead to a default . 
  during the last 12 months , the debt grew by 24 % to 160.5 % of gdp . 
  [ source ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/07/22/greeces-debt-hits-160-5-of-gdp/ ) . 
  the interest rate ( for a 10-year greek bond ) is currently 10 % , so greece must pay 16 % of its gdp just for interest , without paying any euro of its debt . 
  any voodoo text can also answer his question . 
  it depends on the place . 
  here , in wallachia , in the countryside , it 's usually just old women who go to church . 
  and in bucharest , very few people go at all and mostly old women . 
  i do n't know anyone under 40 who goes to church , but maybe that 's not very relevant . 
  nevertheless , in bucharest , the churches still do a pretty good business with the weddings , baptisms and funerals , since virtually everyone ( including atheists ) seem to do them . 
  well , my censor had no problem with me being an atheist , but he was around 18-20 years old . 
  if you mean the census , there was a `` no religion '' checkbox . 
  actually , we 're among the countries where people ** pretend ** to be most religious . 
  if you check the percentage of people who actually go to church ( for any other reason than easter , marriages and baptisms ) , it 's not higher than 15-20 % and much less in the cities . 
  the current system is like this : * i buy an apartment using a mortgage . 
  i have a 20 % down payment , 80 % is loaned from the bank . 
  * the housing market crashes , together with the economy , i become unemployed * i ca n't pay the bank , the bank takes the apartment and sells it for half the original price . 
  * i still have to pay almost half the value of the apartment and i own no property they can take , so they can garnish my income . 
  * since i was n't able to pay , the bank is allowed to give me a `` special '' interest rate ( 20-30 % ) for the remaining part of the loan . 
  i ca n't `` refinance '' since no other bank will want to give me any loan . 
  the result is that i do n't have any property , but i must still pay a third/half of all my incomes to the bank for the rest of my life . 
  ( since the special interest rate guarantees that ), 
  it 's not up with slavs , it 's up with civilization , which some people have a problem comprehending . 
  the czechs are slavs and yet they seem to have no problems with the gays and they even allow same-sex civil unions . 
  we 'd be better off with american-style personal bankruptcy laws , but the banking lobby is too strong here ... 
  the same here in romania . 
  actually , there is one eu piece of legislation which allows you to get your debt discharged if you live outside your country for at least three years and then return to your country . 
  this is meant to make `` debt exiles '' to return home . 
  * economic change , crime , and mortality crisis in russia : regional analysis bmj 1998 ; 317 doi : http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.317.7154.312 ( published 1 august 1998 ) cite this as : bmj 1998 ; 317:312 * rising crime rates amidst transformations in eastern europe : socio\u2010political transition and societal response w cebulak - international journal of comparative and applied ... , 1996 - taylor & francis * legacies of a culture of inequality : the janus face of crime in post-communist countries s karstedt - crime , law and social change , 2003 - springer etc, 
  violent crimes and crimes against personal property were definitely much lower . 
  stealing from the state was however quite common and for small things it was generally overlooked . 
  however , large-scale frauds of all kinds were considered sabotage or `` undermining of the socialist economy '' and , in a couple of famous cases in communist romania , even punished by death . 
  i 'm not sure about the case of east germany , but there were `` real '' statistics in eastern europe that were compiled for the use of the party leaders , with another set for the use of the public . 
  the `` real '' statistics are nowadays available to researchers . 
  referring specifically to the crime rate , the historians ' consensus is that the communist countries had indeed a much lower crime rates than similarly-developed capitalist countries . 
  the reason why this happened is debatable , but the smaller differences in wealth between people ( extreme poverty vs. extreme wealth ) definitely had something to do with it . 
  this kind of flags was popular on geocities sites back in 1999 . 
  was n't this the concept behind stasi and other similar organizations ? 
  and it worked : criminality was lower in pre-1989 eastern europe than in post-1990 eastern europe , but for many people living in those countries , liberty and privacy were more important than security . 
  that 's better than the english-language version of the romanian presidency website : http://presidency.ro/?lang=en  the english version is currently being updated and will be made available again next week . 
    the webmaster it tells us it will be ready `` next week '' since [ february 2008 ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20080227162215/http://www.presidency.ro/?lang=en ) . 
  that 's not the only catch : there 's another one , about having way too many months of winter and only three days of summer . 
  cameron 's crackdown on porn is n't just about the `` porn blocked by default '' , it 's also total banning the `` deviant '' forms of porn , including bdsm . 
  within the uk , scotland will be bound to the decisions taken by england due to its size . 
  this would work well if the english and the scots believed in the same political ideas , but it seems that they do not . 
  this is most obvious is when you look at the percentage of conservative mps in scotland ( 1.7 % ; 1 out of 59 ) , whereas in england , they get half the mps . 
  same here in romania , the tv/radio licenses are paid on the electricity bill . 
  what about the souls of the slaves who died building it ? 
   because usually in public business there 's laziness , waste and way more workers then usually needed i 've seen the same problem in some private companies , especially in huge companies with little competition ( yes , ibm , i 'm thinking about you ) . 
   it is exactly the old state network that 's toast , coupled with increased demand . 
  i just noticed that even in central bucharest we get blackouts during the peak hours ( winter due to heating and summer due to a/c ) , something we did n't get until a few years ago . 
  for cable/internet you can have multiple networks and competition , but , at least in bucharest , the big cable networks used to have secret non-competing deals , so each street was `` owned '' by one cable company and you 'd have exactly one choice . 
  however , a decade ago , there were some small local companies which began laying cable ( [ illegally and the restult is that the city looks like this ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2009-05-26-5746982-46-retelele-cabluri-stalpii-din-bucuresti-sunt-prezent-ilegalitate.jpg ) ) and this made the large foreign-one companies ( like upc ) to rethink their strategy and lower their prices . 
  there are things that are better private/descentralized for which competition is good ( i can imagine how bad and inadequate would be a national state-owned restaurant chain ) and there are natural monopolies ( gas , water , electricity , railroads , etc ) for which it is not possible to have competition , and thus , it 's better to have them state-owned . 
  it 's not possible to have two or more sewer systems in a city , so the owner of the sewer system will get a monopoly on that . 
  at least in romania , privatization did n't bring quality , but only price increases . 
  * electricity : there are more short-time electricity blackouts than they were before the privatization of the distribution network ( to enel italy ) , mostly due to lack of investment since the privatization . 
  * water : quality is the same ( acceptable , not excellent ) , but the price of water increased about six-times in the local currency , four-times in usd * gas : all infrastructure investments are done by the government or local authorities , the company ( gaz de france ) just gets the money from existing customers . 
  ( they have some huge fees if you want to get connected ) * petroleum : we sold a majority share in our oil company to omv for 700 million $ , now it gets 2 billion $ in profits per year ; in this case , the problem was the corruption of our politicians ... 
  our banks get big profits from helping those russian mobsters , so it 's not going to happen . 
   as a software engineer i 'm not so sure i 'd trust a computer . 
  you do n't need to trust it 100 % . 
  you just need to trust it more than the average driver , the kind of driver who speaks on the phone , texts , is often drunk or stoned , is tired , falls asleep , has screaming kids and/or pets in the car , does n't respect the road rules etc. 
  most of the demand for weapons comes from the same country they are produced . 
  then you 're not worthy to be called a balkan country anymore !, 
  maybe , i do n't know much about the uk government ; i know that this kind of corruption is common not just in eastern europe . 
  for instance , the us has a lot of companies like halliburton , bechtel and blackwater which win no-bid contracts and their corporate structure is intertwined with high-ranked people in the administration . 
  and the uk leadership is made out of the best people , not by rich guys who had the right connections ? 
  it could n't be possible that the current pm of the uk would be an old-time pal of the current mayor of london , both attending the same elite schools , right ?
