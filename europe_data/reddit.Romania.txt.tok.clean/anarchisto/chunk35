  less money spent on benefits = more money to be spent on contracts with their pals ' companies . 
  minimum wage job earners can still get benefits in addition to their wages . 
  but the norwegians also get double salaries . 
  ceau\u0219escu was aberrant from the eastern european leaders ' standard . 
  during the 1980s , the opinions of the people in other eastern bloc countries ( such as yugoslavia and czechoslovakia ) about romania and ceau\u0219escu were similar to what we think now about north korea and the kims . 
  but of course it was the political system 's fault for allowing such leaders to get the power . 
  the romanian state admitted it participated in the holocaust . 
  all you need now to do is convince the history teachers of this . 
  then nothing changed since i finished high school . 
  i remember that the textbook ended with the 1989 revolution ( although more than a decade had passed , nothing further was said ) . 
   making big improvements is easier when you start at a lower basepoint and even during the `` golden age '' of the 1930es , romania was a fairly backward and poor european country . 
  of course , it was a low basepoint , but my point was that the principality/kingdom of of romania , in almost a century ( 1859-1948 ) was not able to achieve universal literacy , which was then achieved in a decade ( 1949-1959 ) . 
  the romanian elite never cared about the regular people before that . 
  the `` golden age '' was indeed a golden age for the elite and the quality and size of the cultural output of that era was not found anywhere in the history of the romania . 
   but then , no political system can be 100 % evil or incompetent . 
  which is exactly the point that the taught history should present . 
   the economical performance of communist romania after wwii is not that exceptional try to compare the 1948-1978 period , when we had some `` standard '' communist policies . 
  during that period we had higher growth than western europe . 
  1978-1989 was when ceau\u0219escu did his insane policies . 
    in the 1940s the median romanian family lived in an one-room house made out of cow dung   really ?!, 
  at least in wallachia and moldavia , yes . 
  here in wallachia it was called * chirpici * ( if the house was made out of bricks made out of mud and cow dung ) and * paiant\u0103 * ( if it 's a wooden frame filled with mud/cow dung ) . 
  often they were used together : a wooden frame with mud bricks , or with alternative layers of mud and wood . 
   not the modern medicine , vaccines , antibiotics , sanitation and all other useful implements usually developed by the rotten western democracies . 
  access to modern medicine was already widely available in the 1930s for most of the population in western europe ( which is why when we had 40 years life expectancy in the 1930s , they already had 60 years ) and to the romanian elite . 
  the peasants in interwar romania ( who made up 80-85 % of the population ) had virtually no access to modern medicine . 
  and this was not just in the countryside , if you look at a statistical yearbook in the 1920s-1930s , you 'll see that even bucharest had something like 18-20 % child mortality . 
  what the communists did was making that modern medicine available to everyone . 
  usually laws for `` vandalism '' talk about damage to the property . 
   our great political battle of the 20th century was between the fascists and the ultra-fascists , with hitler helping the former against the later indeed . 
  for those not acquainted with romanian history , the `` ultra-fascists '' , ( or rather , `` mystical fascists '' ) were the [ iron guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_guard ) led by charismatic [ corneliu zelea codreanu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_zelea_codreanu ) , while the regular `` fascists '' ( who had a more german/nazi-style ideology ) were led by [ ion antonescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_antonescu ) . 
  they clashed during the 1941 [ legionnaires ' rebellion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legionnaires'_rebellion_and_bucharest_pogrom ) , during which the iron guard took the opportunity to start an anti-jewish pogrom in bucharest . 
  even today , the romanian fascists are either pro-antonescu or pro-codreanu fascists . 
  romania . 
  * emphasising of the victory and fighting against the ottomans , with less emphasis on the fact that most of the time we collaborated with them and had to pay a tribute . 
  * [ roma/gypsy slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) ( 13th century-1856 ) is usually not mentioned at all * `` conquest was never a goal for romania '' . 
  apart from pokuttya ( medieval ) , southern dobruja ( balkan wars ) and transnistria ( wwii ) . 
  * moldavian and wallachian rulers were romanian patriots before there was a `` romanian '' natin . 
  * communism was 100 % evil , forgetting how it raised the life expectancy from 45 to 70 years , literacy from 50 % to 99 % , child mortality from 20 % to 2 % and how in the 1940s the median romanian family lived in an one-room house made out of cow dung , while in 1989 in a reasonably modern apartment building . 
  * how wonderful was the glorious kingdom of romania ( 1881-1948 ) ; the fact that the army occasionally killed up to a few thousands of protesters ( such as in [ 1907 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_romanian_peasants'_revolt ) or during the 1930s ) is occasionally mentioned , but little about the social causes of those protests . 
  ( incredible poverty ), 
  to the germans here : why is `` insulting organs and representatives of foreign countries '' a crime ? 
  should n't freedom of speech allow this kind of opinions , especially if it 's about an organization or foreign government and not about a person ? 
  would i be arrested if i protested against the north korean government policies as well or just the us has this special treatment ? 
  also , the ryanair flag has the irish 1:2 ratio , whereas the flag they 're burning has a 2:3 ratio , as the ivory coast 's flag . 
  people go there for a good soak . 
   jebo ti pas mater ( dog fucks your mother ) - oddly enough this is usually not a very bad curse word , it 's used by people who do n't want to curse . 
  only in the balkans !, 
   the only dog-related swearing in romanina is `` s\u0103 te fut\u0103 c\u00e2inii '' = may the dogs fuck you . 
  we have many of those sweariungs or similar . 
  we love adding religious stuff to swearings , such as `` futu-\u021bi pa\u0219tele / dumnezeii m\u0103-tii '' = fuck your mother 's easter/gods . 
    a couple of years ago , the market 's interest rates they were forced to pay reached 30 % / year . 
  with the help of the eu/imf , they got this in check , so now their interest rate for 10 years bonds is `` just '' 11 % / year . 
    so once again , thank you eu and imf !!, 
  i do n't see it as a success . 
  greek debt was in q1 2013 [ 168 % of gdp ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_22/05/2013_500143 ) , up from 107 % of gdp five years ago . 
  an 11 % interest rate means it would have to pay at least 18 % of the gdp each year just to keep the same debt level , without repaying anything . 
  this is obviously not sustainable . 
  so the default will happen , it 's a question of ** when ** , not of ** if ** . 
   a default automatically means there is no economy left . 
  in the 20th century , there have been more than a hundred defaults . 
  some countries had several of them . 
  it has nothing to do with `` no economy left '' , it has only to do with policy and politics . 
   the greek government would no longer be capable of even paying its employees , leading to massive poverty . 
  that 's complete and utter nonsense . 
  the greek government had in q1 2013 a primary surplus , which means that they got more money from taxes than they paid for regular expenses . 
  they do have a large deficit because they must pay huge interest rates on the loans . 
  a couple of years ago , the market 's interest rates they were forced to pay reached 30 % / year . 
  with the help of the eu/imf , they got this in check , so now their interest rate for 10 years bonds is `` just '' 11 % / year . 
  the debt levels are unsustainable and sooner or later they 'd have to default , the problem is that by then they 'd have no economy left . 
  not due to monetary policy , but if they had an independent monetary policy , it would have been easier to solve them . 
   honest question to the french people here : are the french women really having so many babies or are the immigrants having so many babies that the national average goes up ? 
  i remember there were some statistics about this and the french women of non-immigrant background still had more children than the average european . 
  i do n't recall the exact figures , but the overall number was around 2.0 , while the french women of non-immigrant background have around 1.9 children ( still very high compared to the german 1.35 children ) . 
  actually , it occurred twice , independently : in europe and in africa ( among the nomadic cow-herders ) , but in europe it spread more because of the european climate . 
   vlach language is some kind of old archaic dialect so literal romanian sounds very different to us , like a really different language even though probably 90 % of words are the same , i guess , but some grammar and pronunciation is different . 
  it 's the language without the neologisms borrowed in the last 150 years , as spoken in rural areas . 
  the romanian peasants across the danube in romania speak exactly the same simple language ( without the neologisms ) and no one is claiming it 's a different language from romanian . 
  99 % of the grammar is definitely not different . 
  you might find some minor differences from standard romanian , but those are standard dialectal differences that you can find on the other bank of the danube as well . 
  from what i read in the romanian press , it 's basically : * no education in their language * the romanian orthodox church is not allowed to build churches * indimidation from neonazis, 
  sorry , i do n't know more details . 
  it 's not a topic you bring up often in conversation . 
  some tidbits about romanians ' relationship with the serbs : * in romania , we say that we never had any wars with just two of our neighbours : serbia and the black sea . 
  * during the 1990s embargo against serbia , romanians did not enforce it very strongly . 
  a lot of people from along the border got rich smuggling reservoir-fuls of gas into serbia or even boatfuls . 
  * many of the people traditionally known as `` serbs '' in wallachia were actually bulgarians who fled ottoman conscription and pretended to be native serbs in order not to be sent back . 
  * i know just one romanian of partial serb ancestry : her serbian grandfather was part of the waffen ss and she said that when she was a child , he told her stories about the war crimes he committed . 
  * romanian nationalists are conflicted by the fact that `` serbs are our orthodox brothers '' , but they do n't treat very well their vlach/romanian minority in timok valley . 
  of course , i 've seen in bucharest a silly `` valea timocului e rom\u00e2nia '' graffiti ( based on the `` kosovo je srbija '' slogan ) . 
  unfortunately , 2 ^ 6 -1 is not a prime number . 
  i think the number of mps should definitely be a prime number . 
  the people of the us are also slightly in favor of snowden , polls saying that more americans think of him as a `` hero '' than people who think of him as a `` traitor '' . 
  it 's a joke . 
  no , there is no burek competition and bosnian bureks might even be better , but i have yet to try them . 
  * winners of the `` balkans ' best burek '' competition * zagreb is a nice city with a typical austro-hungarian architecture . 
  * a lot of yugo-nostalgics , even among young people who were born after tito died . 
  i wonder if that 's valid in other places in former yugoslavia . 
  * `` speak kaj or die '' -- seen on the t-shirt of a zagrebian ; [ kajkavian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kajkavian_dialect ) is a local dialect of serbo-croatian * you must be careful with the sharp pebbles on the beaches . 
  * the dalmatians used to speak an interesting romance language ( that vaguely sounded like italian ) -- now extinct * zagreb is allegedly the intellectual version of belgrade .
