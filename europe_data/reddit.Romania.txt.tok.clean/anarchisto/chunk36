  i guess that means less turbo-folk , more books . 
  * still too many landmines on their fields :-(, 
  [ sperm whale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sperm_whale ) ? 
  in romania , sim cards are available from vending machines , so i guess there 's no eu-wide policy on that . 
  funds for small businesses : * poverty : the funds for small businesses will help you with some financing for your business , but you must pay 50-80 % of the costs yourself , tens to hundreds of thousands of euro . 
  no money = no financing . 
  * lack of experience : for starting a small business you need some experience of some sort in that field . 
  in the depressed areas where there have been no jobs since all the factories were closed down during the 1990s ( thanks , imf !, 
  ) , it 's hard to find experienced people . 
  * corruption : the local authorities make it hard to access these funds in order to get a bribe from you . 
  funds for infrastructure : * eu funds have some strings attached : audits . 
  romanian governmental funds do n't have any string attached . 
  the result is that the politicians can steal something like 10-20 % of the eu funds , but 80-90 % of the governmental funds , so everything is funded from governmental funds . 
  so estonia has meese * like the nordics ?!, 
  now i 'm confused !, 
  true , but they do n't last 10 months , like in scandinavia . 
  that 's not a full list of all the eu official languages , it 's just of languages in which europe is `` europa '' . 
  eu official languages : croatian [ in a week ] , danish , dutch , german , italian , lithuanian , polish , portuguese , romanian , spanish , swedish regional languages : asturian , aragonese , basque , catalan , galician , low german , luxembourgish , frisian , romansch, 
   fluture ( romanian ) comes from the latin `` flutulus '' , so does the albanian one . 
  the problem is that there is no such word ever recorded . 
  it does n't exist in any classical text , in any vulgar latin inscription or in any other romance language . 
  also , `` flutulus '' would have yielded `` flutur '' , with a plural of `` fluturi '' and a back-formation to a singular of `` fluture '' . 
  and while this ( rather awkward ) explanation exists for romanian , there 's no phonetical change possible to explain the mutation latin `` flutulus '' to albanian flutur\u00eb . 
   everything that / u/anacrhisto listed above is pulled straight out of his ass and there are no definitive sources for it , just pseudo-science . 
  these ideas were once some strange `` new '' ideas , when [ hasdeu ] ( http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/cine_sunt_albanesi\u012d%3f ) had his `` who are the albanians ? '', 
  conference at the romanian academy back in 1901 . 
  but nowadays , it 's the mainstream view that the so-called `` dacian '' words have cognates in albanian , even in the dex ( romanian academy 's dictionary ) notes these cognates . 
  if you 're interested more about the technical linguistic part , you can start with the russu 's book `` limba traco-dacilor '' . 
  about the balkan linguistic union you can start reading [ the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sprachbund ) and for a more in-depth scholar view , olga mi\u0161eska tomi\u0107 's book . 
  that was not the point . 
  the point was the declination , both languages add the definite article for feminine nouns by turning ending - \u0259 into - a. 
  [ reply to a deleted comment ]  is albanian considered a slavic language ? 
  no , it has its own branch within the indo-european family . 
  within indo-european , it 's classified either together with balto-slavic and germanic branches ( based on some common words ) or with greek and armenian ( based on some other words and phonological features ) . 
  but these classifications make little sense because there have been so many cross-language influences during the prehistory of the indo-european languages that a simple `` tree '' diagram can not be drawn . 
  but generally , slavic is probably the branch with which it shares the most . 
   or can it be considered a sort of a `` fossil language '' , little touched by later slavic influences ? 
  i 'm thinking of the basque language as an analogy . 
  it can be considered a `` fossil language '' in the sense that it 's one of the three languages ( albanian , greek , romanian ) to survive the slavic settlement in the balkans . 
  there were dozens of old balkan language which went extinct , including ancient macedonian , dacian , illyrian , liburnian , mysian , paeonian , phrygian , thracian , pelasgian and likely many others that were not known from ancient sources . 
  2000 years ago , there were probably a lot of proto-albanian speakers in the balkans . 
  we do n't know where they lived and we ca n't identify them with ancient people ( illyrians , dacians , getae , thracians , etc ) , but based on their vocabulary , we know they lived in the mountains , probably in parts of bulgaria , serbia/kosovo , romania , croatia or bosnia . 
  everything was conquered by the romans , who brought their own language and culture , as well as some colonists . 
  while the colonists were rather few , they were able to assimilate a part of the proto-albanians ( probably those living in the valleys ) , thus creating the people who we would later know as `` romanians '' . 
  the proto-albanians who were not assimilated ( probably living in more isolated mountainous regions ) did nevertheless get their pockets full of latin words , borrowed from that proto-romanian . 
  for example , vulgar latin cavallu ( horse ) was used in balkan latin/romanian as cal ( u ) , hense albanian kal ( \u00eb ) . 
  romanian also has a lot of vocabulary of proto-albanian origin , much of it related to mountain life and a lot of grammar features . 
  romanian , albanian and bulgarian ( and in some cases , greek and serbo-croatian ) share a lot of their grammar and it 's thought that these were not `` recent '' innovations but rather inherited from ancient times , probably from those pesky proto-albanians . 
  for instance , a comparison for the word mother : * albanian [ m\u00ebm\u00eb ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m\u00ebm\u00eb ) / m\u0259.m\u0259 / = romanian [ mam\u0103 ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mam\u0103 ) / ma.m\u0259 / = mother * albanian m\u00ebma / m\u0259.ma / = romanian mama / ma.ma / = ** the ** mother the feminine nouns have ending in both languages in / \u0259 / , which turns into / a / when adding the definite article . 
  who were these proto-albanians and where did they live is still a matter of ( nationalist ) debate . 
  romanians claim they were dacians and thus lived in what is now romania and the albanians claim they were illyrians and lived in albania and former yugoslavia . 
   and that with the constitution sounds interesting but also a little bit dangerous . 
  hopefully they will not screw it up . 
  it also must be approved through a referendum , which it is n't very likely , imo . 
   just a moment - so romania wants to create a new constitution ? 
  that 's big news !, 
  they 've been arguing for it for weeks . 
  the president of the constitutional commission is antonescu , the guy who the `` social-liberals '' want to be the candidate for president , so he 's writing what are going to be his attributions . 
  that might be a big red flag , but we 're lucky that he is lazy ( at least that 's the mainstream press opinion of him ) . 
  he wants to be president , but he does n't want to do many things as president , so we 're safe . 
    the `` deutsche bahn '' really sucks since it became private . 
  it 's not private , it just acts as a private company , even though it 's 100 % owned by the german government . 
  ** romania ** * privatization of the freight railroad company : the imf demanded that this company to be privatized by the end of the month , so the government had no choice but rush it . 
  there was just one offer that was considered : a scrap metal merchant who built his own freight railroad by taking all the profitable routes from the state-owned freight company through a plethora of illegal ways ( mostly by bribing the railroad company bosses in order to refuse those contracts ) . 
  the new owner is a crook , like 95 % of `` successful businessmen '' here , but some people say that at least it was not taken by a foreign corporation . 
  * the constitutional debate : there was a huge debate over what should the constitution contain and much of the debates were about the gays : whether or not to ban discriminating gays or whether or not to ban gay marriage . 
  ( the result was that gay marriage is not banned through the constitution , but discrimination against gay is not mentioned in constitution , either ) . 
  apart from banning gay marriages , the church also wanted to be mentioned in the constitution and so did other churches , so now there 's a whole list of institutions and groups of people ( including the orthodox church , `` the other religious groups '' , the minorities , etc ) who are thanked for their contribution to the development of romania . 
  also , they changed the flag for no reason ( adding the coat-of-arms to it ) . 
   i do n't have time to debate this but have you ever considered that watching the same political news channel on tv , creates an alternate reality bubble around you ? 
  i do n't watch any tv at all . 
  i do n't own have a tv or a cable subscription . 
  but we do n't need the imf loans . 
  in 2012 , romania 's deficit was just [ 2.5 % of the gdp ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/economic/romania-a-avut-in-2012-un-deficit-bugetar-de-2-5-din-pib-usor-peste-nivelul-convenit-cu-fmi-10522715 ) and it was entirely financed using financial market loans . 
  those imf loans were not taken by the government ; they were given to the national bank which gave discount loans to prop up the local branches of foreign-owned ( austrian , greek , french , etc ) banks . 
  we 're getting indebted for bailing out foreign banks . 
   unfortunately , the `` left '' is equally blind when lobbying against privatization . 
  most privatization in romania ( including this one ) were done by allegedly `` left-wing '' governments . 
  would n't it be a better choice to choose managers that do n't `` rob these companies blind '' ? 
  also , from [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/romania-privatisation-idusl5n0ew29y20130620 ) :  bucharest , june 20 ( reuters ) - romania sold rail freight carrier cfr marfa to sole bidder grup feroviar roman ( gfr ) after hours of talks , sealing a deal whose failure could have threatened a 5 billion euro ( $ 6.7 billion ) international monetary fund ( imf ) aid deal . 
    the privatisation of cfr marfa was a ** requirement ** of the imf agreement additionally , the imf requires some other privatizations , including the post offices , nuclear and hydro power plants , but the post office privatization failed due to lacks of bidders . 
  since you 're romanian , i 'm not sure if you 're sarcastic or serious . 
  especially since i keep seeing romanian business owners who militate for summary executions for striking workers . 
  if they are german citizens , they are german . 
  those are romanian citizens . 
  historical reasons : spain has a history of mainstream radical/progressive politics . 
  think of the spanish republic , revolutionary catalunya , etc. 
  italy had its own share of radicalism , but it was less successful . 
  in spain , it took a long and bloody civil war and foreign intervention for the fascists to get the power . 
  in italy , it was much easier . 
  but why did radicalism got more support in the first place in spain than in italy , i can not say . 
  the sky mountain !, 
  most romanians are decent people ... and busy cleaning italian toilets . 
  poland now back to washing inglish toilet . 
   a lot of people in the crowd were ready to fight and die for freedom . 
  what were those people ready to fight and die for freedom doing all throughout the 1980s ? 
  living conditions got bad around 1980/1981 . 
  ceau\u0219escu 's insanity was already in full swing in 1980 . 
  why there were only a dozen or two of dissenters throughout the 1980s out of 20 million ? 
   do n't trivialize the facts with neo-communist propaganda .
