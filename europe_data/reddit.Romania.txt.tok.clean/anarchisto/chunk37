  you 're fighting a windmill . 
  there 's no such thing as `` neo-communist propaganda '' in romania . 
  what can i say ? 
  the romanian one is probably going to be worse than yours !, 
  imperial and royal !, 
   let 's feminize the whole country as much as possible . 
  in some parts of the world , men traditionally wear skirts . 
  [ foustanella ] ( http://www.kiltmen.com/fustanella.jpg ) in the balkans , kilts in scotland , [ sarong ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/sarungan.jpg ) in south asia . 
   people are getting poorer and poorer ?!, 
  in eastern europe , the median person is definitely poorer than even during the communist era . 
  the elite ( not just the 1 % , perhaps the top 10 % and that includes most eastern european redditors ) are much richer . 
  in romania , the minimum wage has been recently raised to 544 lei ( after taxes ) , that is 120 $ / month . 
  that 's a wage for a deep poverty ( physical goods have about the same prices across europe , just services are cheaper ) and more than a third of all workers get that wage . 
  but the differences in incomes is incredibly high . 
  while most workers get 100-200 $ / month ( the after-tax median is around 200 $ / month ) , on some industries , the wages are 10-20 times the minimum wage ( i get over 1500 $ / month after-tax as a programmer ) , so the educated elite is not complaining for the workers ' plight . 
  when i say this , i 'm usually downvoted by other eastern europeans belonging to that 10 % elite who maybe get a wage similar to mine and say that the workers are doing great . 
  towards the end of the speech , there were agitators who began doing something to the crowd . 
  in the background , you can hear someone saying `` someone 's shooting '' . 
  i do n't know if that was the case , but it 's a possibility . 
  my father said that there were people with needles who simply used them to prick some fat ladies who would scream ( quite loudly and in the complete silence that was in the crowd ) and those screams encouraged other people to join them and boo ceau\u0219escu . 
  oil will run out and robots/software will replace most jobs . 
  it 's a matter of when , not if . 
  of course , people who make predictions are just as clueless as everyone else about the future . 
   this is would be an uncontested discouraging people from doing anything . 
  so everything you do is just to get more money ? 
  is that your only motivator ? 
   what about people that can generate richness ( financial or cultural ) but choose not to do it ? 
  profit is not the only motivator in humans . 
  there are plenty of things which people do without getting any monetary profit in return : wikipedia is one successful example . 
  [ ... and this is the link to sign the petition ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/req-eci-2012-000028/public/signup.do ) . 
   people have been predicting this kind of unemployment since the industrial revolution 100 years ago , but it never seems to happen . 
  just because it never happened yet , it does n't mean it will never happen . 
   then the ones who still make money will just move it somewhere else not everyone is a greedy bastard . 
  as one of the guys who still make money ( i 'm a computer programmer ) , i 'm ok with using part of the productivity gained from the software i write for the people who lost their job due to it . 
   yugoslav communism was anti-croatian it 's funny how nationalist serbs claim that yugoslav communism was anti-serbian as well and blame croatian tito for their loss of kosovo . 
   a private pension you can set your own risk tolerance , and , more importantly , that money is yours . 
  private pension funds can be nationalized , too . 
  hungary did this a couple of years ago :  european nations begin seizing private pensions   [ ... ]   the most striking example is hungary , where last month the government made the citizens an offer they could not refuse . 
  they could either remit their individual retirement savings to the state , or lose the right to the basic state pension ( but still have an obligation to pay contributions for it ) . 
  in this extortionate way , the government wants to gain control over $ 14bn of individual retirement savings . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/business/the-adam-smith-institute-blog/2011/0102/european-nations-begin-seizing-private-pensions ), 
  this law is not about the maximum penalty , it 's about minimum penalties which are to be enforced regardless of the case . 
  adding minimum penalties means taking away the power from the judges . 
  a similar trend is found in the us , where there are things like mandatory life sentence for the 3rd offense ( `` three-strikes law '' ) , which has been enforced for things like when a guy working at mcdonald 's spit into a policeman 's hamburger . 
  their language is a strange italian-arab mix : most words seem to be of italian origin , but their grammar is definitely semitic . 
  also , a popular holiday destination . 
  a friend of mine went there with two girls , but he was friendzoned and the two girls argued all the time . 
  he said it was the worst holiday ever , but not to the fault of malta or the maltese . 
   increase the workweek from 35 to 40 hours that should sure solve the problem of high unemployment , right ? 
   to trim the welfare state / cut excessive unemployment benifits / decrease excessive state involvement france has an appalling record in income inequality : there 's too little of it . 
  the poor get too much money and , you see , that 's bad for the finances of the economic elite . 
  see the gini index : * france : 0.293 * uk : 0.345 * us : 0.378 * chile : 0.494 france needs to be more like the us or the uk to be more competitive , if not like imf 's model pupil , chile . 
  so the solution to all this is for france to get a thacher , reagan , but the ideal would be a pinochet !, 
  so basically , their motto is [ travail , famille , patrie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/travail,_famille,_patrie ) ? 
  the differences are probably due to different definitions of what is `` unemployment '' . 
  a major change in the economic system . 
  there are many ways to fix the problem , but all of them require some serious changes . 
  the `` easiest '' ( without deep changes to capitalism ) would be some changes in the central european bank 's policies , but of course this will never happen due to germany . 
  i 'm not mad . 
  those rich greeks brought a lot of other people with them , many of which stayed here , so there are many people who have some greek ancestry . 
  my gf is one of them . 
   trotsky hung out there for a while . 
  trotsky hung out everywhere it seems , [ even in bucharest ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/rakovskytrotskygherea.jpg ) . 
   i 'm guessing that autonomy from ottoman rule is what kept the romanian language a romance one . 
  bulgaria was not autonomous and they still speak a slavic language , though they do have a turkish-speaking minority . 
   that being said , does romanian happen to have any words of turkish origin at all ? 
  yes , a few hundreds words , many of them related to food ( for instance , ciorb\u0103 = soup ) , dress ( papuci = slippers ) or customs ( bac\u0219i\u0219 = tip ) . 
  a bit of a history of romania-turks relations : in the middle ages , the ottoman empire conquered the romanian lands just like rest of the region , but unlike bulgaria , serbia or hungary , the romanian lands were kept autonomous in exchange for a yearly tribute . 
  at first , the rulers named by the turks were romanian , but they had some bad experiences , i.e. 
  revolts against them -- such as the infamous vlad who hated the turks so much that he massacred all the muslims he found in wallachia . 
  so the turks switched to naming rich greeks ( in exchange for a fee ) from the phanar district of constantinople as princes . 
  these rich greeks would pay the sultan a huge sum to become the princes of wallachia or moldavia . 
  after they became princes , they 'd try to squeeze as much money out of the locals , in order to recoup their `` investment '' . 
  the irony is that these huge sums they gained were later used in the greek independence movement and the `` phanariotes '' who were so hated in romania became the heroes of the independence movement in greece . 
  following some revolts in wallachia that were intertwined with the greek independence ( 1821 ) , the turks agreed to return the rule to local boyar families . 
  half a century later , romania fought alongside russia in the 1877 war and it gained its independence from turkey . 
  after 1989 , turkey was the closest `` capitalist '' and their `` capitalist goods '' were cheap and readily available , so we imported turkish chewing gum and blue jeans for a few years during the early 1990s . 
  now many people enjoy the beaches of antalya . 
   from the land of \u00c5 \u00c4 \u00d6 . 
  are you as proud of your vowels as [ these norwegians ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488ujaqgmw ) ? 
  well , according to lega nord , africa begins at rome . 
  they 'll not surrender that easily because they have to follow the proper bureaucratic procedures for surrender . 
  ( hint : kafka 's books were inspired by austrian empire 's absurd bureaucracy ) . 
  hopefully , they would not try to get the sudetenland , too . 
  also , independent scotland wants to be nordic . 
  i 'm thinking about having a federation for the balkans , with rakia ( \u0161ljivovica / \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 / \u021buic\u0103 ) and turbo-folk ( chalga/manele ) . 
  * albania * bosnia * bulgaria * croatia * greece * kosovo * macedonia * moldova * montenegro * romania * serbia * slovenia what could go wrong ? 
  yay !, 
  estonia nordic !, 
   traditionally , in a country like romania , the diet is seasonal . 
  i think , traditionally , everywhere the diet was seasonal . 
  now you know why other guys behaved too friendly towards you . 
  background : a park ( or rather , one of the rather few parks ) in central istanbul is going to be built up , being the place where a new shopping mall will be built . 
  protesters arrived to stop the trees being cut down and the police intervened against them . 
  there 's no point in trying it if it 's legal . 
   how do you guys see this in 10-20-30 years ? 
  eastern europe is still very religious , or at least , pretending to be so . 
  in romania , fewer than 10-20 % of the people go to church every week , but over 90 % believe in god and around 98 % claim to belong to a religion ( according to the last census ) . 
  we do have our share of religious extremists , both home-grown orthodox and us-financed protestant nuts . 
   will churches still be used ?
