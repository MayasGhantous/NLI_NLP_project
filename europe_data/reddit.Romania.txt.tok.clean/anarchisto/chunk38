  yes , the buildings will still be used .

   no ugly people on sweden ( they swipe them to finland ) is there any reason why there are a lot of ridiculously good-looking people in sweden and so many really ugly people in finland ? 
   a pretty unknown fact is that the romanian neo-communists that grabbed power from ceausescu said that they will install a scandinavian socialism . 
  the romanian `` neo-communists '' were actually neoliberals in sheep 's skin who told the people that they 'll use the `` swedish model '' of economy , while giving away all the industry , natural resources and public services to private companies , who disbanded all the industry and jacked up the prices for public services . 
  indeed . 
  also , speaking of hungarians living in neighbouring countries : i do n't understand the reason why the hungarian government gives citizenship to people who are ethnically hungarian in other eu countries . 
  apart from making them vote in national elections , what other reason would you do that ? 
  it seems that there are millions of romanians ( not all of them ethnically hungarian ) who are eligible . 
  for instance , my girlfriend 's great-grandfather was a czech born in salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n and that makes her eligible , if she 'd speak hungarian , even if she does n't have any actual hungarian ancestry . 
  there used to be an image circulating a few years ago with three plates ( i could n't find it on web ) : * pre-trianon hungary as schnitzel * current hungarian borders ( eaten from the pre-trianon schnitzel ) * an empty plate ( post-eu accession ), 
   soon you 're missing an ** evil laughter **, 
  there 's nothing ironic in this : the `` right-wing '' supports the foreign capitalists , while the `` left-wing '' supports the romanian oligarchs . 
  the foreign capitalists were the ones requesting subsidies for building those wind mills , so it 's obvious they found allies among the `` right-wing '' . 
  the higher price eats into the romanian oligarchs ' profits , hence the `` left-wing '' 's decision . 
  in romanian politics , there 's no such thing as ideology , it 's just interest groups . 
  ... and it was inherited in [ modern meme imagery ] ( http://www.troll.me/images/monocle-guy/you-cant-handle-the-monocle-thumb.jpg ), 
  well , they 're selling the railroad freight company for less than the scrap metal value ... 
  ask them if there 's any way of making major changes to the economic system while we still have some economy left .

  nowadays , in muslim countries , the young are much more secular than the old . 
  a friend who went virtually everywhere around the middle east said that the only exception to this rule are some former soviet countries in central asia where the older generation was educated by the soviet union in a secular way , but the new generation found religion as a `` solution '' to their problems . 
  but this is not the case in the middle east/arab countries . 
  during the 1950s and 1960s , there was a generation of secular politicians and an intellectual elite , but the people , especially in the countryside , were always very religious . 
  as for immigrants , it 's not fair to generalize based on some young people who did renew their faith . 
  most people still remain not very religious and use `` muslim '' as some kind of an ethnic identity . 
  it 's not just those requirements , because bulgaria does n't have them . 
  neither hungary nor austria allow gay couples to adopt , but hungary allows singles to adopt , regardless of their sexual orientation . 
  i do n't think that 's valid for austria . 
   in western europe you either believe in god or you believe in progressing towards egalitarianism and subjectivism so you dislike the idea of marriage equality for gays because you think that gypsies will outnumber you , not because an invisible man in the sky told you so , right ? 
  i ca n't say that 's a better reason . 
  you 'll see the shops round those prices to $ 99.95 . 
  so the `` best places to invest '' are the places with the lowest taxes for companies , according to them .

   the statue of king olav was painted red by `` russ '' we have people painting red statues and monuments in bucharest , too . 
  : * [ the memorial of the rebirth ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:the_memorial_of_rebirth.jpg ) ( dedicated to the 1989 revolution ) actually looks better with the red blood-like paint dripping , so it seems they 're going to let it like this - it 's been more than a year since [ they did it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rrjhckrupe ) . 
  * [ king carol i of romania 's equestrian statue ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:statuia_carol_i_bucuresti_-_semiprofil_spate.jpg ) had the oversized testicles of the horse painted red . 
  it seems that it does n't help the statue at all , so they 've cleaned it up within a week . 
  oh , they do this as well here . 
  could that be what we call `` electoral tourism '' in romania ? 
  busing people from one vote precinct to another to vote multiple times ? 
  very common here and all the major parties support it because they all do it . 
  there were proposals of creating a central database so multiple votes would no longer be possible , but everyone opposed it . 
   clearly having rigid labor market does n't work for spain well , the spanish and greek governments have been removing all the protection for employees for the last few years and the result was that more and more companies took the opportunity and laid off more and more employees . 
  i do n't see entrepreneurship rising in spain or greece or multinationals flocking to those countries , even if they have much more `` flexible '' labour markets . 
   well , there is the us of america . 
  yes , but the us is different in many ways from europe . 
   if you want to have the next oracle to be born in europe , you need to give ability not only entrepreneurs but also to companies and corporations do what they need to do to be as successful , as profitable and as fast growing as they can be . 
  the way the eu is structured , the labour market ca n't work the way it works in the us . 
  each country is on its own , they 're trying to force the large corporations to stay in their country ; they lose too much if the companies leave . 
  the government will have to pick up the tab and pay unemployment benefits , etc for those people laid off . 
  in the us , this is not an issue : if a company leaves california for nevada , it does n't affect that much the state of california because the unemployment benefits , social security , food stamps , etc. 
  are paid from the federal budget to which the company and the new employees will contribute in the new state . 
  as long as the eu is not going to be a true federation , we ca n't have a flexible job market . 
  the americans like to `` think big '' . 
  they want their product to `` conquer the world '' , so they 'll sell it to the global market . 
  europeans start-ups tend to be centred to their home-country and little beyond that . 
  this is limiting their growth and without this , their growth perspectives . 
   firing employes is either expensive or down right impossible . 
  i do n't think this is an issue . 
  i know that the entrepreneurs complain about this , but i do n't see countries with weaker protection for employees being more entrepreneurial . 
   declaring personal bankruptcy is impossible in most european countries . 
  this is indeed a real problem and it 's part of the way the eu countries are overprotecting their banking systems , even if this means that the rest of the people and businesses are worse off . 
  i noticed that the culture of a company is generally based on the country of origin of the managers . 
  i have worked , among others , for romanian and scandinavian companies and neither of them had the flaws you describe . 
  they had their own , different , flaws . 
   though the government claims most of it being used it is used with technology from half a century ago . 
  half a century ? 
  that 's too optimistic , much of the land is still worked with horses by subsistence farmers . 
  but now the countryside started to get deserted as millions of romanians flee the poverty from here to move to western europe . 
  i was going to mention the bad weather as well , but then it 's not like scotland has better weather . 
  well , is n't the finance world a bit mad ? 
  are you sure you were born in belgium and not a rabies-infested dutch bat ? 
  actually , in many countries were sexism is rampant , education is one of the few acceptable carrier paths for women . 
  a better example would be the parliament : only 14 % of the members of the turkish parliament are women . 
  turkey stands quite badly on gender equality in the society and on the job market in turkey and the best way to see this is in the raw figures :  out of 26 million employable women in turkey , only 5.9 million are in the labor force .

  yeah , `` light eyes '' is rather unclear . 
  does it contain just blue and grey eyes , or also green or hazel ?
