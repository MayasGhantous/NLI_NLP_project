  so it went up from 4.6 % to 8.9 % ? 
  this is part of the `` lying with statistics '' series . 
  during the communist era , there were far more roma who graduated high school , so they could also say that `` roma high school graduates and higher education has halved in 25 years '' . 
  ... and there it goes out the window germany 's technological superiority .

  i think there were quite a few kings assassinated by anarchists . 
  * millions of empty homes * millions of people who ca n't afford houses the solution ? 
  10 times higher property taxes for inhabited homes ( with an exception allowing one holiday home per family ) . 
   are you saying no sharing is needed ? 
  i was not saying that i agree with all those points , i just said this is what people think . 
   really ? 
  i see the exact opposite happen . 
  they feel that the neoliberal values ( `` free market at all costs '' ) are enshrined in the basic documents of the eu . 
  this was the reason why the left-wingers in france and other countries opposed the european constitution a few years ago . 
  i am a federalist , but i can understand some of their concerns : * people in northern europe do n't trust the people of other countries in southern and eastern europe ( much of this is due to a caricatural image in their press , too ) * people in richer countries ( north or south ) think they 'd need to `` share '' more of their wealth with poorer ( eastern european ) countries * national identities are going to fade away faster and there are still quite a lot of people who think this is a bad thing * left-wingers in western european countries think that any step away from the nation-states is going to be a step away from welfare state and more towards a neoliberal state . 
  * eastern europeans ( especially hungarians , romanians and bulgarians ) began to have a slight euroscepticism due to the feeling that everything in their countries is owned by foreigners and they must pay rents for using their own resources . 
   you 'd be surprised . 
  tito is not that highly regarded in current day croatia , at least not in the center-right leaning segments of society . 
  maybe the croatians and serbs i happen to know are all left-wingers . 
  when we met in zagreb a few years ago , they all had only good things to say about tito . 
    modern croatian nationalists would have more nice things to say about good ole adolf , than about josip broz . 
  oh , ** that ** kind of nationalists !, 
  of course , but nutrition is one of those mandatory factors . 
  with bad nutrition , the other factors no longer matter . 
   mid-day meal programs in schools are essential to ensuring children are well fed ... and well-fed children are essential in having a healthy and intelligent next generation . 
  you know those iq by nation maps which show people from africa having low iq while compared to europeans , north americans and asians ? 
  the reason is in nutrition , not genetics . 
  authoritarian schmucks !, 
  i 'd send them up to the [ fletcher memorial home for incurable tyrants and kings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqonco0a68o ) . 
  if any yugoslavs hear you , they 'll complain that it 's not fair because tito was n't like the others . 
   [ europeans ] feel that the economic narrative of recent years has been driven by dry technical concerns ; for example , by calculations geared primarily by a consideration of the impact on speculative markets , rather than by sufficient compassion and empathy with the predicament of european citizens who are members of a union . 
  indeed . 
  the eu badly needs to become a federation . 
  this would not be a problem within a federation , but now , the young southern and eastern europeans who are working in other countries do not contribute for their own parents ' pensions and health care , but they contribute to their new country 's system . 
  afaik , bacon does n't create physical dependence . 
  what a silly idea : then kids will drink it because it 's banned . 
  the solution is education , not banning it . 
   using the same principle minors should also be banned from fast food actually , i went a few weeks ago to eat at mcdonald 's . 
  i work somewhere around the business district in bucharest ( close to pia\u021ba victoriei ) and i expected the customers to be the usual corporate workers who eat in the other restaurants in the area . 
  but it was full of high schoolers who just finished their classes . 
  i could complain about these young people , but then i 'd feel like a priest who complains about how many respectable people he saw inside the brothel . 
  afterall , i went there to eat in the first place . 
   yes , because one day i drank a litre of fizzy drinks and now i am hooked , having to drink litre after litre to simply give a feeling of normality . 
  actually , some people do get hooked by coca-cola and drink 1-2 litres of it every day . 
  the mix of caffeine and sugar can create dependence . 
  it 's a visual representation of electricity consumption . 
  it would be half of the country if it would be less < 100 % of the national median . 
  anyone who lives within 200 metres of a gyspy automatically becomes poor . 
   should be able to , with ** a decent government ** , to lift itself out of poverty over time where can we get one of these things ? 
  because in each country , most things ( including housing , utilities , even food ) are priced according to the median income . 
  300 $ in romania do n't have the same buying power as 300 $ in norway . 
  in romania , we got a nice piece of land ( dobruja ) along the black sea after we got our independence ( thanks , russia ! ), 
  and with it , we got plenty of turks . 
  the turkish people here are nice people , we get along fine and there has never been any problem with them , afaik . 
  as an interesting anecdote , a few years ago , their mufti was called up to the saudi embassy and they `` recommended '' him to be more radical about the insults of islam in muhamad cartoons ( which were republished in newspapers here ) ; this happened after he said that those cartoons are no big deal and that romanian muslims should not be enraged by them . 
  i have n't seen any statistics or studies , i just noticed from the news that the mass shootings in europe happen in countries with widely available guns . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence that they happened in norway ( breivik ) , finland ( [ jokela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jokela_school_shooting ) , [ kauhajoki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kauhajoki_school_shooting ) ) , sweden ( [ malm\u00f6 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\u20132010_malm\u00f6_shootings ) ) , but none in spain , which has very few guns . 
  note that the overall crime rate is higher in spain than in scandinavia . 
  well , the criminality is n't usually reflected by the number of guns , but mass shootings tend to be in such gun-crazed countries , even if they 're generally peaceful places ( norway , finland , etc ) . 
  the devils are already on strike . 
  in completely unrelated news , serbia has the most guns per capita in europe . 
  ( or possibly , second after switzerland , depending on whose estimates )  recently , the serbian daily newspaper `` vecernje novosti '' published `` serbians are armed to the teeth '' ( srbi naoru\u017eani do zuba ) . 
   the article claims that the citizens in serbia currently possess about three million illegal firearms . 
  [ source ] ( http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2013/03/26/guns-in-serbia-where-are-the-numbers-coming-from/ ), 
  even if they had no resources , they could have lived off shipbuilding , software and tourism . 
  norway has only around 5 million people . 
  [ 21 incredibly angry songs about margaret thatcher ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/angelameiquan/21-incredibly-angry-songs-about-margaret-thatcher ),

   oh balkans , please cut this bullshit already ... 
  should n't the vlachs and slavic macedonians of greece have education in their languages and bilingual signs ? 
  here in romania , we used to have a pay-as-you-go system of pensions : what was taxed from the employees was paid to the pensioners . 
  however , the government came with a great idea : `` private pensions '' . 
  so , the taxes go to the private pension companies ( which are basically big banks , i personally use ing bank 's pensions ) who then lend most of the money to the romanian government . 
  you might say it 's the same thing . 
  if the government ca n't pay its debt equals government ca n't pay the pensions . 
  for the regular people , it seems to be the same . 
  but for the banks , it 's not . 
  each year , they get 1 % of the sum for `` administration '' , no matter what . 
  basically , we 're paying 1 % more for nothing . 
  here in romania , all major parties have their own paid-posters ( `` postaci '' in romanian ) , who post opinions on all romanian-language forums , trying to swing the public opinion against or for a certain party . 
  similarly , companies have their own `` postaci '' for trying to mend their reputation online . 
  yeah , but unfortunately none of the rivers ' phonetics fit to the latin/dacian to romanian phonology . 
  they were borrowed to romanian from other sources . 
  for instance , alutus -  olt is probably via a slavic intermediary . 
  for most of the other large rivers , we do n't know what was the intermediary . 
  danube is an exception because its phonology makes it possible to have entered romanian in ancient times , even though its reconstructed form , * donaris is quite different from the latin danubius . 
  timi\u0219 might show an albanian/dacian feature of b/m change , so it 's possible that it was borrowed in romanian directly from the dacians . 
  also , the etymology of arge\u0219 is n't ancient ordessos like some of our linguists claim , but some cuman word for `` highlands '' ; initially the name was borrowed as `` arghi\u0219 '' ( which looks nothing like ordessos ) and in time mutated to `` arge\u0219 '' . 
   you 're really stretching the definition of colony . 
  yes , of course , it 's not a `` colony '' as in `` the age of colonization '' , it 's more like an `` expansion '' . 
  nevertheless , it 's not uncommon to use the word `` colonization '' for this . 
   afaik , slavic toponyms are distributed rather equally regardless of altitude/geography . 
  not really . 
  in the plains , there are far more . 
  i do n't have real data , but that 's what i noticed . 
  compare the names of the [ highest mountains in romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mountains_in_romania ) with the name of rivers in the plains . 
  around bucharest , for instance , almost all the rivers have slavic names : d\u00e2mbovi\u021ba , colentina , mosti\u0219tea , cociovali\u0219tea , ialomi\u021ba , ilfov , snagov etc. 
  we , romanians , colonized plenty of places during the medieval times , but not by our state , but by simple people who moved for greener pastures ( literally , since many were shepherds ) . 
  in some places , we were assimilated by the locals , in others , we assimilated the locals .
