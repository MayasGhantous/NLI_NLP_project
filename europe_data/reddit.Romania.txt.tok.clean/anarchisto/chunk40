  so here 's a list of what we colonized : * transylvania - our `` homeland '' used to be half-inhabited by romanians ( highlands ) , half by hungarians ( lowlands ) ; in 1240 , the mongols massacrated the people in the lowlands ( mostly hungarians ) and romanians were able to fill the vacuum quickly ; the ethnic makeup has been kept since . 
  * wallachia and moldavia -- they were inhabited by slavs , romanians from the carpathians assimilated the local slavs living in the plains * greece , albania , macedonia -- some high mountains colonized are a branch of the romanians called '' [ aromanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians ) '' / `` vlachs '' who speak a language related to romanian ; they probably colonized those areas around 1000 ad ; many have been assimilated as greeks , macedonians , etc during the last 100 years . 
  * slovakia , czech republic -- we colonized some mountainous areas in what 's now [ moravian wallachia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_wallachia ) and some parts in slovakia ; they were assimilated , but they still eat [ bryndza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bryndza ) * croatia -- the [ istro-romanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istro-romanians ) reached istria peninsula . 
  they were assimilated mostly during the last 200 years , there are only a few villages where they still speak a dialect of romanian . 
  * bosnia -- we 're proud to say that we 've done our part in creating the mish-mash of ethnicities in bosnia , our settlers helping the serbian side become mix with the locals * ukraine -- actually , the almost-barren steppe was [ colonized by the russians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_serbia_ ( historical_province ) ) ; they wanted to attract serbs , but most of the people who showed up were romanians from transylvania and moldavia . 
  if balkanians who are prone to argue will do their arguments on the internet , it 's less likely they 'll go out and kill each other . 
  they have a very [ \u0160vejk ] ( http://www.memorialmatejekudeje.cz/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/svejk.jpg ) feeling . 
  everything i know about the french tax system comes from le d\u00eener de cons . 
  the spanish republics were built during wartime . 
  show me a country under siege that is a paragon of transparency . 
  if the president 's family is corrupt , we wo n't re-elect them . 
  if the king 's family is corrupt , what can we do ? 
  because in wales , they count female sheep , too . 
  here , the police simply arrests the antifas when showing up at neonazi rallies . 
  i can understand when the police prevents violence , but these are cases in which there 's clearly not going to be any violence : * cyclists protest against the lack of bike paths in bucharest ( it was eventually approved , but the approval was delayed until the evening before the protest and the place had been changed several times ) * protests against using cyanides in gold mining ( they almost never get approved ) * protest against shale gas extraction also almost no protest around the government and parliament buildings ever get approved . 
  usually the gay pride gets approved , but that 's due to western pressure : it 's usually supported by the western countries ' embassies ( including sweden 's ) . 
  southern italy . 
  1000 $ / month should be enough , but i guess that depends on the place where you want to stay . 
  generally , it 's like this : * the further north you go , things get more expensive * the further east you go , things get cheaper * the further south you go , food gets tastier  anyway , coach surfing and hitchhiking will save you a lot of money . 
  it 's interesting that now due to greater acceptance of gay people in the society , there 'll be fewer people wanting to be monks . 
  also , for dogs : * azorel - ? 
   and they ca n't be priests anymore if they divorce . 
  unless the wife is the one who wants divorce , then they 're more lenient . 
  also , the orthodox monks ( who generally vow chastity ) are generally gay . 
  the church would turn a blind eye to homosexual practices in monasteries , unless there was a big scandal ( and throughout the history , there have been plenty ) , when they 'd just shuffle around the monks to other monasteries . 
  in romanian , '' [ panicos ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/panicos ) '' means paniquard , panic-prone person . 
   they also produce some very smart and productive people , many of whom move to other areas of the country where they contribute greatly to the common good of the union . 
  the same happens in the poorer eastern and southern members of the eu : there are plenty of bright people from there who move to germany/france/uk / scandinavia . 
  the main problem is that the system in the eu is n't working because there 's relatively very little redistribution from the very productive countries to the less productive : they take our best people ( our freedom of movement is similar to the us ) and we get very little in return ( there 's no eu-wide social security ) . 
  what about pr\u0161ut ? 
  pastry of turkish origin with cheese or meat . 
  at least the pork section of the championship . 
  excellent !, 
  now the eu has better chances of winning the world burek championship . 
  that 's the only version of capitalism which has been tried . 
  all attempts to do a pure version of capitalism revert to crony capitalism . 
  it 's like with all the versions of authoritarian communism ending up with a soviet-like system . 
  if you require every unemployed person to count beans for 4 hours a day in order to get their welfare , then you get very low unemployment and keep the people busy . 
  yes , it did start to eliminate them : * i no longer call a travel agent to buy a plane ticket , i use a website * when i buy something online , there 's no need for any human intervention . 
  when you buy something online , the data is automatically sent to the post office , the label is automatically printed and put on the box , the box is automatically filled in by robots with goods and a conveyer belt takes this box to the post office 's car . 
  in the post office , it 's automatically sorted , etc. 
  almost no human in sight . 
  * the companies need far fewer accountants when much of the accounting is done automatically by erp systems ; you just feed in the documents and the reports are done automatically . 
  * the us economy has now [ 1.1 million fewer secretaries than it did in 2000 ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/smart-machines-job-article-1.1246522 ) * the eu lost in the last few years almost 6 million jobs that were replaced with technology , most of them desk jobs . 
  behind a desk doing what ? 
  repetitive desk jobs have already been or will soon be replaced by software . 
  i 'm not elitist , i just think that it 's hard to turn most 50-years old truck drivers into engineers or programmers or whatever jobs are being created by this new economy . 
  you are right , but the problem is that those people are n't educated enough to be able to do `` more productive stuff '' , otherwise they would n't work as truck drivers . 
  yeah , as if europe 's biggest problem is `` lazy people '' , not unemployment . 
  it would be a rather small percentage of the gdp and most countries in the west already have a substantial percentage for welfare . 
  giving it to everyone would definitely reduce by a lot the administration costs that are currently , quite high . 
  indeed . 
  imagine just one inovation 's effect : the driverless car : it will lead to at least 50 million unemployed people across the world . 
  that alone is an insane number . 
  lorry/truck drivers , bus drivers , taxi drivers , chauffeurs , delivery men ( for automatic restocking supermarkets , for instance or mail delivery to pick up points ) , etc. 
  10 million people work such jobs in the us and another 10 million in the eu . 
  can our current system handle this ? 
   i 'm from the uk and i 'm pretty sure the russians would like me . 
  yup , they 'd like you . 
  unless you 're black , or asian , or muslim , or from the caucasus , or gay . 
   one should see and judge a project like europe in centuries and not decades . 
  peace is more important than national egoism . 
  many people are n't against european unity , but oppose the eu because it imposes some ideas for granted ( economics , mostly ) , without any democratic process . 
  for instance , has anyone asked people if we want an central bank independence ? 
  ( i.e. 
  central banks being ruled by the commercial banks ), 
  most european governments are [ officially secular ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/map_of_state_religions.svg ) . 
  whether the law is respected or not is a different matter and the european court of human rights does exactly that : verifies if a country 's government respects the laws of that country . 
  afaik , the people who do n't live in greece are exempt . 
  it seems that in much of europe , `` the germans '' are now what `` the jews '' were 70 years ago : a scapegoat . 
  the regular germans do n't get anything out of this . 
  blame the capitalists , bankers ( regardless of nationality ) and their politician minions , not the germans , jews or other nationality . 
   t 'll practically be a feast of economic success compared to the last four/five years they have been saying that the next year will be the year of greek economy 's rebound for like four years now . 
  and greek economy kept going down ; so far it lost nearly a quarter of its gdp ... 
  the countries which had no austerity now are above 2007 : this includes the us , scandinavia and germany . 
  the countries which had austerity ( like uk or southern europe ) , it will take many years to go back to 2007 . 
   the guy they are saluting , codrean , could be described as a eastern european fascist version of ch\u00e9 guevara . 
  i 've seen his face on the tshirts of scandinavian fascists aswell , he 's famous in the extreme right wing , kind of an icon . 
  you can see t-shirts of ch\u00e9 worn by people who are n't communist . 
  he 's a symobl of rebellion , not only of left-wing . 
  for codreanu , no one except fascists wear his image . 
  btw , i 've seen in italy people wearing t-shirts of mussolini , so i think he is not the only fascist with a following in europe ... 
   what 's especially interesting to me is that the who claims that 82.5 % of people in bosnia never drink the responses depend on what context is the question . 
  -- what religion do you have ? 
   muslim do you drink ? 
   no , muslims are n't allowed to drink . 
  -- what do you do on friday night ? 
   i go clubbing and drinking . 
  what do you drink ? 
   beer , wine and \u0161ljivovica, 
  we have the same recipe , just that in addition of rice , we put some pork in the grape leaves as well . 
  well , everything in the balkans has at least some pork in it . 
   wait why is a first world country getting aid again ? 
  because rich countries have a lot of poor people . 
  just like poor countries have some rich people ( who typically get the lion 's share of the aid from first-world countries ), 
  the average here is about 1/4 of the minimum wage in france . 
  there 's a difference between culture , language and ancestry ( genetics ) . 
  the language , while heavily influenced by slavic ( vocabulary ) and by the balkan substratum ( grammar , phonology ) , remains still latin in its core . 
  the traditional culture of the romanians preserved very few ancient latin ( unlike , for instance , spain and italy ) cultural features . 
  the genetics say we 're mostly of `` balkan '' ( presumably dacian/thracian/whatever ) ancestry , with some significant slavic and italian ancestry , and , in smaller doses , some germanic , celtic and some turkic/asian ancestry .
