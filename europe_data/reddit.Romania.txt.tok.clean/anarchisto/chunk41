   do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in wallachia called themselves that the oldest surviving dated document written in romanian ( neac\u0219u 's letter , 1521 ) uses this . 
   do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in wallachia called themselves that or that people outside the principality itself referred to it as such before the 1800 's ? 
  plenty of them . 
   genetically speaking , romanians are not latin . 
  genetically speaking , neither the french , nor the spaniards are latin . 
   romania was the name of the byzantine empire the name of romania has nothing to do with the name the byzantines used for themselves . 
  it 's simply that both the romanians and the greeks ( romaioi ) called themselves `` roman citizens '' . 
  the native name of wallachia was \u021aeara rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 ( `` rumanian land '' < vulgar latin `` terra romanesca '' ) . 
  `` rom\u00e2nia '' was a neologism coined from `` rom\u00e2n '' ( romanian ) in order to be used for the whole romanian nation ( as opposed to just wallachia ) . 
   were adamant about legitimizing the idea that they were directly descended from the romans well , the language is descended from latin and that 's what matter . 
  any claim of genetic purity is nationalist nonsense and that 's valid for any nation . 
  we 're all a mix of people from across the continent . 
  i 'm not surprising  the romanian language is n't slavic even though it used to be written in cyrillic because there are clear latin influences `` there are clear latin influences '' is an understatement . 
  the core vocabulary is 80-90 % inherited from latin . 
  a lot of the `` lesser '' vocabulary is indeed slavic , but that does n't change the basic fabric of the language . 
  for culture , it 's a different thing , slavic cultural heritage is much more visible than ancient latin cultural heritage , but i do n't think there 's a dispute over the language . 
  romania comes from our ethnic name , `` rum\u00e2n '' or `` rom\u00e2n '' , which in turn comes from `` romanus '' ( roman citizen ) . 
  the whole balkan peninsula was conquered and colonized by the romans , but we were the only people to keep their latin language in this region . 
  further south , the greek influence was strong enough to prevent latin language from spreading and in hungary , the latin people were probably assimilated by the slavs and then by the hungarians . 
  the former ( rum\u00e2n , rum\u00e2nesc , rum\u00e2nia ) was generally far more often used before our 19th century elite promoted the use of the latter ( rom\u00e2n , rom\u00e2nesc , rom\u00e2nia ) to emphasise our latin origin . 
  many languages still use the `` u '' version . 
  before the modern era , our local neighbours ( hungarians , slavs , etc ) called us `` vlachs '' ( ol\u00e1h in hungarian , \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0445 in slavic ) , but we never used that term to refer ourselves . 
   horses may be given hormones and other chemicals that cows for human consumption would not have been given , actually , race horses may get some antibiotics which are n't good for human consumption , due to being potentially cancerogenous . 
  it 's the cows who get the growth hormones . 
  apart from the antibiotics ( which most horses wo n't get , anyway ; the race horse get them only in case of injury ) , arguably , horse meat is healthier than other kinds of meat : the horses are quite picky about food , so they wo n't accept all the crap that we feed cows , like protein meals made from bones and meat , which led to the mad cow disease in the first place . 
  your prisons will turn makeshift criminals ( because using drugs is a crime ) into real criminals . 
  ( because they can no longer ever get a job ), 
  around that area , there are hungarian villages and romanian villages , you can draw the border to include just the hungarian villages . 
  [ this is a map of the communes ] ( http://sebok1.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/retnikai.jpg ) -- an even better map would be a map of the villages . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  indeed , but that was related to the technology at that time . 
  with current more advanced and productive technology , it should be even easier to have an `` easy life '' for everyone . 
   there has n't been much neoliberalism in slovenia neoliberalism contains : * eliminating price controls \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * deregulating capital markets \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * lowering trade barriers \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * no nationalizations without compensation \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * reduction of subsidies across all economic areas \u2714 ( eu requirement ) * the government borrowing money from the free market \u2714 * privatization of state companies \u2714 * floating exchange rates \u2714 * fiscal austerity \u2714 * privatization of utilities ( water , railroads , etc ) -- underway * privatization of healthcare ( us-style insurance system ) -- to do * privatization of education ( vouchers system ) -- to do, 
  indeed . 
  privatization is a socialist concept . 
  it was n't about `` competition '' as it was about fear . 
  communism was a great scarecrow for both the capitalists and the western governments . 
  they wanted the workers to be happy , because they thought ( rightly so ) that otherwise , they could become radical . 
  now there 's virtually no left-wing radicalism ( the `` radical '' policies of today are the `` social-democratic '' policies of a few decades ago ) , so there 's no need to appease the workers . 
  the balance of power between the workers and the elite keeps changing . 
  in the western world , life used to be easier than now for the average person during the 1960s and it was far worse during the 1860s . 
   it 's this bullshit neoliberal religion that 's pushing 3/4 of the world into poverty do n't worry , it 's not going to push just 3/4 of the world into poverty , it 's going to push all the world into poverty , all for the benefit of the 1 % elite in each country . 
  subsidies in europe/us/japan : * for the farmers : guaranteed money , less risk , they can compete ( and win ) with the third world farmers . 
  * for the european/american/japanese people : cheaper food * for the companies in eu/us/jp : slightly higher taxes , but more stability ( supply of food is an important factor in stability ) overall , in here , it 's better for everyone . 
  -- however , the third world is flooded with cheap subsidized food . 
  their farmers can no longer compete . 
  it used to be a way of lifting oneself out of poverty : sell food , buy equipment , industrialize the country . 
  of course , asking the developed world to do something against their own interests is pointless . 
  all the wealthy countries ( us , eu , japan ) spend huge amounts of money to keep agriculture going , although it would be far cheaper to `` outsource '' it to the third-world ( africa , south america ) . 
  the main reason is control : if any of them were importing much of their food , the countries exporting the food would have a certain degree of power over them . 
  people can live with more expensive oil , but more expensive food could lead to protests and fall of governments , maybe even a revolution . 
  of course , the way the subsidies are distributed in the eu ( favoring large-scale industrial farms and certain countries ) reflects the lobby in brussels and that 's a different topic . 
   let 's talk about belgium . 
  that 's [ rude . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/belgium.shtml ), 
   sofia looks comically identical with bucharest . 
  indeed , ugly apartment buildings ( in which just some apartments got their exterior renovated ) , derelict buildings , stray dogs , ugly fences , general disrepair of the public spaces and , if i go to the suburbs , gypsy slums with streets without asphalt and sewerage . 
  it feels like home !, 
   the reason why kosovo is so important to us is because of heritage you should get over it , you 're not going to ever get it back . 
  serbs are not the only nation to lose their most `` precious '' historical land : * the armenians lost their holy mountain , ararat , to turkey * the greeks lost their great city , constantinople , to turkey * the romanians lost part of bukovina , the core from which the moldavian principality grew , to ukraine . 
  neither can be reverted , because in this age , only the ethnicity that inhabits those lands matters . 
  a bit of history of what happened to the jews in romania : * northern transylvania : occupied by hungary , the local jews were sent to auschwitz by the hungarian authorities * transnistria ( ukrainian territories occupied by romania ) : jews killed by einsatzgruppen in collaboration with the romanian army ; biggest massacre in odessa . 
  * bessarabia : some jews killed by einsatzgruppen in collaboration with the romanian army ; the rest were deported to transnistria by the romanian army . 
  * right-bank moldavia : a part of the jews were deported to transnistria by the romanian army , which was also involved a pogrom in ia\u0219i ; nevertheless , many survived . 
  * wallachia ( including bucharest ) and southern transylvania : a few jews were deported to transnistria and some were killed during an anti-antonescu rebellion of the iron guard ; most survived . 
  holocaust deniers here in romania look at the fate of the jews in southern romania and they say `` look this way , antonescu saved the jews of bucharest '' , disregarding the massacres in moldavia , bessarabia and transnistria , which they claim were made only by the einsatzgruppen , not the romanian army . 
  the map simply shows that isps still do n't take ipv6 seriously . 
  in romania , there 's just a big isp ( rds ) that started deploying ipv6 , hence the higher percentage . 
  of course , it was n't an ideological failure , but a military one . 
  in western countries , communism failed mostly because the army was strong enough to quell any revolution . 
  other western revolutions , in bavaria ( 1918-1919 ) and spain ( 1930s ) , were similarly destroyed by stronger armies . 
   i wonder how it would have turned out if the first communist revolution happened in a country where anyone could understand why the cheka actually , the first communist revolution ( la commune de paris ) did happen in a developed country ( france was arguably the most developed country at that time , if not industrially , at least socially , culturally and in living standards ) , just that they were crushed within a few months . 
  it 's a funny thing about what southern americans and eastern europeans think . 
  the eastern europeans think about the russians almost exactly what the southern americans think about the us . 
   a lot of peasants benefited from communism , including my own grandparents . 
  in two generations , my family went from `` poorest in the village '' to `` urban intelectuals '' . 
  same in my case . 
  my great-grandfather was in the 1930s a fisherman on the danube , living with his large family in a 2-room mud hut and eating all-year-round fish and m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 , with the occasional vegetables during the summer . 
  my grandfather was sent to be an apprentice in bucharest , to become a tailor ; my father is an engineer . 
  within the pre-wwii framework , my father would have had almost no chance of getting an engineering diploma , as my grandfather was just a badly-paid tailor . 
   you can have good social mobility in a capitalist state with the correct framework and government support . 
  pre-wwii romania had no such `` correct framework '' and with left-wingers being repressed , there was no one to support it , either . 
  fewer than 1 % of young people got to study at university , an overwhelming majority being children of the economic/political elite . 
  fewer than 5 % of the children graduated from secondary education and almost half of the population was illiterate . 
  well , in socialist countries , it depended on each country . 
  in romania , [ the orthodox church collaborated quite well with the communist authorities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthodox_church_in_communist_romania ) . 
   but some would argue that it does contain class discrimination embedded into it . 
  how can there be class discrimination , if by marx 's definition , social classes are part of the capitalist mode of production ? 
  in early socialist romania , there was some `` affirmative action '' ( in education , for instance ) for people from peasant/worker families , but that did n't prevent plenty of people of bourgeois origin ( in romania , for instance , petru groza and mihail sadoveanu ) to become part of the ruling elite . 
   the problem with historical communism is that it existed in authoritarian states and was run by authoritarians actually , there is one exception for that rule : [ anarchist catalunya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_catalonia ) , before stalin 's minions repressed the anarchists and other communists . 
  basically : * communism argues for a better world for everyone , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion . 
  * nazism argues for a better world for the chosen race and no rights for the `` untermenschen '' ( jews , africans , gypsies , etc. ) . 
  of course , the way it was implemented has nothing to do with the theory . 
  yeah , they 're about right . 
  on the groceries , there are listed probably the cheapest you can find . 
  indeed . 
  they ** blackmailed ** us into giving them rights , such as education in their own language . 
  such horrible , horrible people , those hungarians !, 
   the cost of renting and paying for utilities and food in romania and luxembourg is not comparable . 
  surprisingly or not , the cost of the cheapest food is not very different across the eu .
