  the average price of products that are bought tend to be different because in richer countries people tend to buy more expensive/higher quality products , but if you buy your food from a discount supermarket , you should n't notice any major difference in prices . 
  for utilities ( especially for energy ) , the eu is trying to `` harmonize '' the prices in order to have `` one market '' for gas and electricity , so for the last decade , prices have risen and in 5-6 years , the prices are supposed to reach the eu `` market prices '' . 
   if we want to achieve economic equality between countries , we 'd have to stop admitting new member states western balkans ( bosnia ( 4 million ) + serbia ( 7 ) + albania ( 3 ) + macedonia ( 2 ) + kosovo ( 1.5 ) ) wo n't make a big difference . 
  their total population is only 3 % of the 500 million already in the eu . 
  things are however different for turkey ( 76 million ) and ukraine ( 45 million ) . 
   does western ( i count you guys into west , btw ) corporate corruption generate the horrible living conditions of gypsies you guys force them to live in ? 
  this feels like bringing an off-topic subject just as an attack . 
  something like `` oh , yeah ? 
  you germans killed jews '' . 
  this is not an argument . 
  i agree that the state does n't do enough to integrate them , but the romanian state does n't do much for the ethnically romanians , either , hence the millions of romanians working abroad ( in italy , spain , germany , etc ) . 
   this answer is imo a non-answer it 's going to the eu budget , which is used for , in order of the amounts : agriculture subsidies , regional development , research , international aid , cross-border infrastructure . 
   the point of failure lies with how easily corruptible are the people manning the borders . 
  how come no one ever thought about paying them decent wages ? 
  you know , 3-400 $ / month is hardly a livable wage , even in romania . 
   the fact that others are corrupt does n't mean we are any less . 
  i 'm not arguing that we 're not corrupt . 
  i know we are . 
  i even worked for the romanian branch of a big `` fortune 500 '' company and they bribed the director of the state institution who was the beneficiary of the project for which i worked . 
  but i feel that they 're like the customer of a prostitute who , after having sex with her and paying her , starts telling her how immoral is her way of living . 
  by paying her you 're supporting her lifestyle , you 're just as guilty as she is !, 
  there might be clear legislation prohibiting this , but it 's hard to enforce . 
  people have different ages , experience , etc. 
  and even for two men doing the same job at the same company , there are pay differences . 
  it might be a better deal to hire women , but that does n't mean that managers think it like this . 
  they also consider that there are some `` hidden costs '' for hiring women : pregnancy , child leaves and simply being less likely to do any unpaid overtime . 
   but the cost of living is not the same . 
  of course . 
  but to get the purchasing power of 160 $ ( the romanian wage ) in romania , you 'd need 361 $ in luxembourg , ( using imf 's ppp data ) but that 's still far away from luxembourg 's 1800 $ minimum wage . 
  i find it funny how western countries keep discussing about how corrupt is romania or the rest of eastern european countries , when much of the corruption is generated by western companies who give millions of euros in bribes to our politicians . 
  why are they not as tough against their own companies when it 's found that they paid bribes in eastern europe ? 
  * finland : patria was involved in bribes paid in order for slovenia to buy military equipment . 
  * sweden : ericsson was involved in bribing scandal in romania ( they claimed the hq did n't know and sued thomas lundin , the local manager in romania ) * germany : siemens was involved in plenty of corruption scandals everywhere . 
  i 'm sure i can find hundreds of examples of western companies like that . 
  gender equality is important , but the commissioner brings the wrong argument : economics . 
  in the eu , a man get 20 % more money than a woman for doing the same job . 
  in luxembourg , a janitor gets 1000 % more money than a janitor in romania , for doing the same job . 
  ( assuming both of them get minimum wage ) i think that if the goal is just `` to achieve full economic potential '' , the eu needs more economic equality between countries than gender equality . 
  he 's a guy who had a business which went bankrupt . 
  the reason seems to be `` bad business decisions '' , but he became convinced that if he had to pay no taxes and he did n't have to pay the minimum wage ( 160 $ / month ) to his workers , he might have succeeded . 
  so now he has a ( very popular ) blog in which he spews his hate of the working class . 
  and when i use `` hate '' , it 's not a hyperbole . 
  he wants every `` troublemaking '' worker dead : that the army/police/private guards should be allowed to kill strikers , like in the good old days . 
  he wants that `` communist '' activists should be banned from holding any job ( using a blacklist ) , so that their only choice would be `` suicide '' , which he thinks is not a big deal , as there are plenty of workers from where they came from . 
  he has slogans for business owners like `` be proud of every worker who died because of you ! '' . 
  basically , he 's a psychopath , which makes his opinions very popular among the higher and upper-middle classes . 
  i have friends in spain , italy and slovenia . 
  they 're complaining about how things have been getting worse for the last few years and the economic stats tend to support their views . 
  the spanish friend says that his university classmates are either unemployed or leaving the country . 
  of course , `` full communism '' is as bad as `` wild capitalism '' , but no one ever argues a ban on promoting `` wild capitalism '' . 
   the eu is becoming more socialist every second the share of the incomes of the top 1 % gets bigger and bigger every year . 
  how is it more socialist ? 
  i do n't know any left-wing organizations which are against democracy , but there are a few nationalist or neoliberal . 
  for instance : * noua dreapt\u0103 ( new right ) - neonazis who used to claim they do n't participate in elections because they do n't believe in democracy . 
  i think they now claim they agree with democracy , but one with a press that bans `` misinformation '' . 
  * mihai giurgea and his capitalists ' dictatorship -- he claims that workers should have no rights and that only business owners should be allowed to have any say in the state : proportional to the amount of money they pay in taxes . 
  he even proposes an armed rebellion to reach that goal . 
   i understand the romanian sentiment it 's not `` the romanian sentiment '' . 
  more than half the people say in polls they 'd like communism back and some politicians might be scared by the thought that the power of those untapped voters ( who do n't vote because they think both parties are the same ) . 
  stalin claimed the same . 
  and the democratic people 's republic of korea claims to be democratic . 
  there 's no country in the world which ever called itself `` communist '' . 
  they were all `` people 's republic '' or `` socialist republic '' . 
  why should n't communism be considered an option ? 
  it 's not the same thing : nazism is incompatible with democracy because it argues that some people are * untermenschen * who should get fewer rights . 
  ( in some case , not even the right to live ) communism is not incompatible with democracy . 
  if people want to be materially more equal , why should you ban their effort ? 
  of course arguing for a dictatorship is wrong , but virtually all modern-day communists do n't argue for that . 
  it 's also about banning personality cult of communists ( presumably , that bans che guevara t-shirts ) and organizations that promote any communist ideology . 
  italy and greece have worse corruption perception than romania and bulgaria ( according to transparency international ) . 
  why is their corruption acceptable , but ours is not ? 
  if it was really about corruption , they would speak against the huge amount of corruption generated by the mafia in italy , as well . 
   a lot of other states should be forced to leave . 
  actually , only two schengen agreement countries have higher rates of corruption perception than romania and bulgaria : italy and greece , but there are others ( slovakia , czechia , hungary , poland , baltic states ) who are not in much better standing . 
  the press release is that the * national institute for the investigation of communism 's crimes * says that the law project will include `` banning the establishment of communist organizations '' . 
  they do n't say `` stalinist '' or any nuance about it . 
   banning organizations for being communists seems awfully close to thought crime ... ironically , pretty close to what the commies did . 
  the same thing happened in the 1920s and 1930s in the kingdom of romania . 
  hundreds , or maybe thousands of communists were arrested and sometimes sentenced to `` forced labour for life '' just for being communists ( which was assimilated to treason ) . 
  this included [ many post-wwii communist leaders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communists_imprisoned_by_the_kingdom_of_romania ) , including gheorghe gheorghiu-dej and nicolae ceau\u0219escu . 
  does n't matter , we saw some boobies . 
   yes . 
  labour mobility is part of the idea of the eu . 
  ... and then the press of the country where they will move will start the usual '' < country  immigrants are stealing our jobs '' claims , leading to general hostility against the immigrants . 
  [ romanians and bulgarians snap up 175,000 jobs in the uk already ... and that 's before the borders have even opened ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2287116/romanians-bulgarians-snap-175-000-jobs-uk--thats-borders-opened.html ) -- daily mail , march 2 , 2013 . 
   clearly not all roma are gipsies , but the ones who are cause a lot of problems , a romanian should be the one who knows that best . 
  that should work in the us as well :  clearly not all african-americans are niggers , but the ones who are cause a lot of problems , an american should be the one who knows that best . 
  that 's a big problem all around reddit , not just / r/europe . 
  see this discussion i had yesterday on / r/worldnews : http://i.imgur.com/ike4shd.png my comment saying that `` racists are a problem in europe '' is now at -37 [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19gek9/gypsy_community_sealed_off_with_a_18m_wall_mayor/c8ntbc0 ), 
  the problem is n't youth unemployment . 
  it 's unemployment . 
  the youth have a larger percentage of unemployment simply because they have less experience , but if you give them more experience , the unemployment would simply be distributed across all ages . 
   did n't the communis regime sort out some of the retrogressive elements of gipsy culture they tried , with mixed results . 
  you have to consider that over 90 % of them were illiterate in the 1940s ; the communists did achieve almost universal literacy . 
  many of the roma were still nomads and they were settled in villages or cities as nomadism was banned . 
  but despite of the good intentions of the communist leadership , racism and discrimination never disappeared . 
  some of the roma were however assimilated and merged within the general romanian population . 
  when a gypsy integrates in the society , almost always they no longer consider themselves roma/gypsy . 
  sometimes you can see a romanian having a good education and job with obvious `` gypsy '' physical traits ( skin color , nose/face shape , etc ) , but it would a big faux pas to ask about one 's ancestry . 
   what about the other gipsies .
