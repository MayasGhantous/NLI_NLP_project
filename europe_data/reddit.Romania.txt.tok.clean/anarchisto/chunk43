  did n't they buy bread from the gipsy bakery ? 
  generally the roma are quite spread around , a few dozen houses in every other village , usually on their outskirts . 
  there are only a few villages that have a majority . 
  what 's more to know about this story is that the local romanian/hungarian communities fully supported the mayor in segregating the roma people : he was reelected last year , having 86 % of the votes , the highest percentage of any mayor in romania . 
   i 've never met anyone who had contact with and tried to defend roma it 's easy to say you hate them , but hard to understand why they are like this . 
  first of all , they were always looked down . 
  it probably has something to do with the [ era when they were slaves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) . 
  it 's quite similar to the black slavery in the us , but there , the us did more to try to integrate them . 
  there 's the lack of education : their tradition does n't encourage studying and our schools are n't very welcoming to them , either : kids and teachers alike make fun of them . 
  there 's the lack of jobs : romania ( and bulgaria , for that matter ) have a shortage of jobs . 
  in many places , you ca n't find even those jobs for minimum wage ( 160 $ ) and if they hire someone , there 's always the blatant discrimination against roma people . 
  i remember a recent story in a newspaper about a bakery built using eu funds in a village : it hired only roma people to work in it . 
  but no one bought the bread : everyone around the area knew it was `` bread made by the gypsies '' . 
  it went bankrupt and the bakery was bought by another company which hired romanians . 
  it now thrives . 
  poland makes things . 
  eu 's top exporters , in billions of dollars ( 2011 ) : * germany : $ 1547 * france : $ 589 * netherlands : $ 550 * italy : $ 524 * united kingdom : $ 479 * belgium : $ 332 * spain : $ 309 * poland : $ 193, 
  i do n't drink coffee , i take tea , my dear . 
  `` a clearly improving situation '' and `` rebounding '' are probably two different translations of the same thing . 
  but then it 's hard to explain related words such romanian * [ r\u00e2nz\u0103 ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r\u00e2nz\u0103 ) * ( tripe , stomach ) and albanian * [ rr\u00ebnd\u00ebs ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rr\u00ebnd\u00ebs ) * ( rennet ) . 
  is the similarity a coincidence ? 
  ( rennet are the enzymes obtained from the stomach of some animals and it 's used for making cheese ), 
  it 's one of those etymologies for which neither the meaning , nor the phonetics fit , which leads me to think it 's wishful thinking and a rich imagination . 
  using that chart is misleading . 
  the gdp grow chart looks about the same . 
  romanian also has * ca\u0219 * , which is from latin caseus ( just like in the other latin languages ) . 
  the word * br\u00e2nz\u0103 * seems to be of pre-proto-albanian ( whether it 's ancient dacian , thracian or illyrian has still not been clearly established ) , being derived from old romanian * r\u00e2ndz\u0103 * ( stomach ) . 
  romanian substrate is related to albanian , but it 's thought to have been split from the albanian tree before proto-albanian ( which is the language spoken by the ancestors of the albanians during the roman era ) , so that 's probably sometimes before 100 bc . 
  when the romans came here , some of the people were completely romanized ( and the result was the romanians ) and some just partially ( and the result was the albanians ) . 
  albanian has quite a large number of latin borrowings , being borrowed from the same balkan latin that evolved into romanian . 
  on the other hand , romanian got a lot of other features from albanian , such as phonology and grammar , features that are also shared with bulgarian . 
  the most interesting feature is the suffixed definite article : it 's shared by albanian , romanian ( romance ) , bulgarian ( slavic ) and no other romance and slavic languages have such a feature . 
  the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth is back !, 
  dear prole , the purpose of austerity is to make the government spend less for things such as public services ( healthcare , public transportation , education ) or social security ( welfare , benefits , pensions , housing ) . 
  these expenses are generally used by the poorer parts of the society and paid by us , la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me . 
  as a rich capitalist , i do n't need your healthcare ( i can buy better than your stinking hospitals ) , your trains and buses ( my private jet is better ) , your social housing ( i like my gated mansion , thank you ) or your welfare or pensions ( i earn more money in a day than you earn your entire life ) . 
  since i do n't use any of that , i do n't see why i should pay for any of it . 
  now go back to work !, 
  -- your friendly capitalist, 
   there is no pan-eu media to create common topics . 
  but we do have common european topics . 
  the latest was horse meat . 
  of course it 's a good thing . 
  the problem is that in order to make it feasible , you 'd need stronger central institutions . 
  i do n't know more . 
  but if you can read the bruxellois dialect of legalese , try reading the [ directive 2009/72/ec 13 july 2009 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:32009l0072:en:not ) . 
  its goal is :  to achieve efficiency gains , competitive prices , and higher standards of service , and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability . 
  and they argue that :  undistorted market prices would provide an incentive for cross-border interconnections and for investments in new power generation while leading , in the long term , to price convergence . 
  so we 're going to have price convergence , but not minimum wage or living standards convergence . 
  in the ikea in bucharest , they just announced they withdrew all the meatballs from the restaurant . 
  it 's not 1 billion , it 's $ 395 million for the distribution company in southern romania ( including bucharest ) . 
  still a very small sum . 
   enel purchased from state-owned electrica in 2007 a 50 % stake in electrica muntenia sud for $ 395 million [ source ] ( http://business-review.ro/featured/enel-granted-option-to-buy-13-7-stake-in-electrica-muntenia-sud/ ), 
  the electricity prices are still regulated by the state , but we must increase the prices to the eu `` market price '' for the next few years . 
  after this , there should be no regulation on the prices , all being set by the `` free market '' . 
  it 's a mandatory eu directive , so our government ca n't refuse to implement it . 
  from what i understand , the bulgarians are protesting because of corruption , poverty and ( as a specific issue ) the increases in electricity prices . 
  the eu demanded that our ( bulgarian and romanian ) electricity and natural gas prices must be increased to the level of the `` market prices '' in the eu , so now there has a gradual increase in prices . 
  also , in both countries , the electricity distribution has been privatized ( almost given up for free , the government got almost nothing ) . 
  in my district ( bucharest ) , the owner of electricity distribution is enel , from italy . 
  romania uses mostly natural gas ( half of which is imported , half local production ) for heating , bulgaria uses much electricity ( a lot of hydro and nuclear ) , hence their protests during wintertime . 
  the median wage , yes . 
  the average wage is around 450 $ , but that 's skewed by the incomes of the top 5 % . 
  speaking of the bulgarians ' `` higher wages '' demand : as an interesting piece of statistics , romanians and bulgarians get a lot less in median income as percentage of the gdp/capita than the western countries . 
  gdp/capita : * romania : $ 8405 * bulgaria : $ 7158 * france : $ 42377 individual median income : * france : $ 18165 = $ 23975 = 56 % of gdp/capita * romania : [ $ 193 ] ( http://business-review.ro/money/the-median-household-income-in-romania-was-eur-558-on-h2-12478/ ) / month = $ 3054/year = 35 % of gdp/capita also , note that in romania , the median is very close to the minimum wage ( 160 $ / month , before taxes ) and more than a third of the workers earn this minimum wage . 
  well , they are a bunch of people ( [ noua dreapt\u0103 ] ( http://www.nouadreapta.org/ ) ) with no life who go and protest against various things ( generally related to gypsies , homosexuality , abortion etc ) . 
  they do n't have a party because they do n't believe in democracy . 
  ( and they would n't get even 1 % ) there has no violence related to them , afaik . 
  theoretically , fascist movements are illegal . 
  practically , they manage to get by through using the celtic cross rather than the legion 's symbols , but they do hold banners of [ codreanu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_zelea_codreanu ) . 
  do n't worry , you 'll be ok here . 
  apart from a few `` nationalists '' who picket the bucharest gay pride and any public lgbt events , the young people are quite accepting of sexual minorities . 
  if there are the same old corrupt candidates , people complain about their links with the mafia and nepotism ; if they are new candidates without any links to the political class , people complain about being inexperienced . 
  well , from what i know , cioran did n't repudiate fascism , he simply refused to discuss ideology anymore . 
   do n't ruin the idea of anarchism by associating grillo to it i 'm not saying he 's an anarchist , some pd leader said that , probably as an insult . 
  due to self-proclaimed socialists like [ martin luther king , jr. ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_luther_king,_jr . ), 
  and [ malcolm x ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malcolm_x ) , communists like [ benjamin j. davis , jr. ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benjamin_j._davis,_jr . ), 
  and their actions such as [ `` we charge genocide '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_charge_genocide ) ? 
  without them , there would have been no civil rights movement . 
  it would be a bit like 1950s-early 1970s france , not like today 's france . 
  nowadays , most of the french financial industry and large corporations are private . 
  things went quite well for france with the `` trente glorieuses '' and all that . 
  after the fall of communism , the standards of schooling fell in eastern europe mostly due to underfunding of the education system . 
   the impression i get from many stories is that communism , and especially the central planification that comes with it , is a great way for a country which is lagging behind to come back at the level of its neighbor . 
  unfortunately , at this point , it seems unable to go forward . 
  soviet-style communism works great for creating large corporations , factories and infrastructure . 
  however , most inovation does n't come from them , it comes from small businesses and that 's what the soviet system lacked . 
  i think an ideal system would be a two-tiered system , having large corporations centrally-planned , while the small and medium businesses to be independent and decentralized and everyone to be allowed to be an entrepreneur if they wished so . 
  of course , it 's an utopia , i do n't think this could happen anytime soon . 
   the virtually cosmopolitan cruelty and callousness specific to the 18th-19th century would 've continued in romania had it not been for communists that cruel and callous system did continue up to the 1940s and i see no reason why it would have not continued after the war . 
  you have to take in consideration that in the west after wwii things improved only because of the communist scarecrow . 
  ever since the communists went down , the quality of life of the average worker has been going down , despite the obvious improvements in productivity . 
  debates over homosexuality : some romanians still find it hard to accept that homosexuals exist and they have the same rights as the rest : * the romanian peasant 's museum organized some events about lgbt culture . 
  the neonazis and christians protested and stopped the screening of a movie about a lesbian couple ( the kids are alright ) , arguing about the sanctity and christianity of the romanian peasant . 
  * some high schoolers organized another event about lgbt culture . 
  a homophobic organization had a billboard against homosexuality next to the highschool . 
  some activists threw white paint on it and eventually , the owner of the billboard was fined by the anti-discrimination council . 
   i 'm sure that a self-governed , non-exploited country which could build its identity , economy and political class since the end of the war would be better off now . 
  romania was a self-governed , non-exploited country between 1877 and 1947 . 
  it was supposed to be `` free '' .
