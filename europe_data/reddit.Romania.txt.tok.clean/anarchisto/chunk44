  in practice , our army would kill people at the drop of a hat . 
  in 1907 , the ( literally ) starving peasants began rioting . 
  the army killed over 10,000 peasants ; they used cannons against them . 
  whenever workers began striking , the army would shoot and kill them . 
  if you were left-wing , you were fair game . 
  thousands of people were sent to prison just for being left-wingers . 
  owning certain books was a crime . 
  the 1923 constitution banned executions in peacetime , with one exception : communists . 
  if you were convicted to be a communist ( having communist beliefs was enough ) , you could have been executed , though most were just convicted to forced hard labour for life . 
  i do n't see one reason why the same kind of repression would have not continued . 
   you should n't assume that we would n't do it ourselves if we were able to . 
  but we * did * it ourselves . 
  after 1958 , we were n't doing what the soviets said anymore . 
  they wanted romania to be an agricultural country , we refused and began industrialization . 
  much of our cultural elite happened to be fascists . 
  some of them `` repented '' and stayed here , some even supported the communists . 
  some of the fascists refused to repudiate their ideology , including some great names of romanian culture , such as eugen ionesco , emil cioran and mircea eliade . 
  they were forced to stay in exile . 
  i 'm not saying there were no honest victims during the 1950s , but many of the people who are now seen as `` heroes '' and `` martyrs '' in romania for `` fighting communism '' were simply fascists , who , a decade earlier were writing virulent antisemitic pamphlets and some were even involved in the pogroms . 
  it 's hard for me to have any pity for the iron guard members who were involved in the infamous abattoir killings , when jews ( including children as young as 5 ) were put on hooks alive like cattle in the bucharest slaughterhouse before being tortured and killed . 
  one that one of the leaders of the social-democratic partito democratico said they 're `` anarchists '' . 
  that 's a slightly better description , but just slightly . 
  an even better description would be `` libertarians '' , in the european meaning of the word . 
  ( i.e. 
  left-wing libertarians , not american-style ayn rand fans ), 
  yup . 
  berlusconi calls everyone who is critical of him a `` communist '' . 
  the economist magazine ran a series of articles about his government 's incompetence and corruption and he called it `` the ecommunist '' , nevermind that the magazine has a capitalist point-of-view . 
  the words for `` i-don ` t-like-you '' are `` fascist '' , in left-wing vocabulary and `` communist '' , in right-wing vocabulary . 
  do you think that giving regular people more power is something to be scared of ? 
  i feel that many people think democracy is a good idea only as long as the people do n't have any actual power . 
   while there is plenty of employment opportunities for less skilled labour . 
  there may be more opportunities , but generally these jobs tend to be very poorly paid . 
  generally , when i hear `` there 's a shortage of [ profession ] '' , it means that there are n't enough skilled people willing to do that profession for the pay they 're offering . 
  it 's probably about the active workforce ( 18-64 ) , not the whole population . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but in romania , communism , despite its crimes , had some very positive changes ( at least until 1980 , when ceau\u0219escu started his [ insane austerity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_austerity_policy_in_romania ) ) . 
  * pre-wwii romania was overwhelmingly rural . 
  85 % of the people lived in villages . 
  by 1990 , more than half lived in urban areas . 
  the 1930s were very tough times for the peasants : they had very low living standards and many of them were constantly in debt and were threatened eviction from their houses by the banks . 
  * almost half of the romanians were illiterate . 
  in just 10 years in the 1950s , romania officially stamped out illiteracy . 
  everyone who could n't read ( regardless of age ) had to take literacy classes . 
  * higher education was expensive and just 1 % of the population would complete higher education . 
  after the communists took over , it was free and they encouraged the working class children to follow it . 
  * in the 1930s-40s , romania had 15-20 % child mortality due to easily preventable diseases . 
  it was reduced by more than 90 % in just 10-20 years . 
  but let me tell you my family 's story : my grandfather was born in a poor fisherman 's family : eight people living in a two-room mud-brick hut on the danube 's shore , living off cornmeal polenta ( m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 ) with fried salted fish ( saramur\u0103 ) they fished from the lakes along the river . 
  he moved in bucharest in the 1940s and worked as a tailor and , after the communists came , he was able to lead a confortable enough life . 
  his two children ( my father and my aunt ) graduated higher education ( engineering , economic studies ) . 
  this would have definitely not been possible during the 1930s and even now it 's not possible to pay for a four-people family 's expenses and an apartment 's rent/mortgage with the median wage [ 200 $ -300 $ ] , let alone with a minimum wage [ 160 $ ] . 
  creating more languages ? 
  that 's like when you have 10 standards and you want to make another one to be universal : you then have 11 standards . 
  [ do n't mention the war !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xnnhzgcwtk ), 
  i thought it involves drinking large quantities of beer , eating duck and pork knee and being definitely not german . 
  * four months earlier , october 2012 : *  dutch prime minister mark rutte 's liberals agreed a coalition with the labour party on monday and vowed to follow a path of austerity . 
    `` we realize that this package will affect everyone in the netherlands , everyone will feel it , '' rutte told a press conference . 
  `` but we think it is necessary if our beautiful country is to emerge stronger from the crisis . '', 
  ( [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/us-dutch-politics-idusbre89s0y520121029 ) ), 
  do n't let the horse know he 's going to die , which in practice means using a stun gun to make it lose consciousness before being killed . 
   the governments of the balkans countries are just trying to exploit the foreign investors the poor foreign investors . 
  they 're just trying to maximize their shareholder value and the big bad balakan governments would n't let them . 
   if the local politicians in albania and bulgaria point the finger on evil foreign corporations , they will divert attention from the real problems and corruption they 're causing . 
  when big foreign corporations bribe local politicians , those corporations are just as guilty as the local politicians . 
   no other investor will be willing to take that risk , seeing how corrupt and thieving the countries are . 
  if no investor is going to bribe politicians to get the utilities for next-to-nothing , it would be great for these countries . 
  foreign utility companies do like this : * they buy the utilities for very little money , usually by bribing local politicians . 
  * they increase the price with the approval of the government , which says that the eu 's common market laws require us to pay the `` real market prices '' ( which means the similar prices for utilities across the eu ) , even though the costs here are much lower ( due to our wages being 10 % of the ones in the west ) * they make no investment at all , not even the investment that is required by law , leading to worse services for the consumers * despite getting more money , they often have little to no profit because money is sent back to the country of origin as `` licensing fees '' , `` management fees '' , etc. 
  basically , we pay them money without getting anything in return . 
   those was true for czechia , hungary and all post-communist countries at all . 
  it stem from overall mistrust in other people . 
  why it has changed in some places faster than others ? 
  the median wage ( not average , but median ) in romania ( and presumably it 's the same in bulgaria ) is around 200 $ / month . 
  if your electricity bill grows by 30 $ , it 's a big deal . 
  what 's the median wage in czechia ? 
  a 30 $ increase in electricity bills is not a big deal for them . 
   the people 's mentality , which has been strongly formed during the communist years and that those foreign people who come to the country come to `` rape and pillage '' actually , the people are right . 
  those companies came here for profits , not for charity . 
  since they get a monopoly in electricity distribution , they can charge as much as the state allows them to charge . 
   since 2008 , in response to the economic downturn , most big european countries have cut defence spending by 10-15 per cent . 
  finally , we have come to our senses . 
  europe still has way too many soldiers . 
  maybe in wwi and wwii , the sheer number of soldiers mattered a bit , but now it 's pointless to have as many . 
  we do n't need two million soldiers . 
  we need to replace most of them with drones and a pact of not using drones except for self-defense . 
   the only difference between it being the private sector or the state the ones providing water is that one charges you directly and the other charges you more but through taxes . 
  i agree that most of the increases in the 5-times increase in the price of water after privatization are due to electricity increases ( also mandated by the eu ) and the decrease of subsidies , but nevertheless the local water company ( owned by veolia ) also gets each year hundreds of millions of euro in profits , at the same time as the rest of the economy is struggling . 
  same here , in bucharest , the local water company is owned by veolia ( france ) . 
  cuza never promised the church any financial assistance . 
  that 's a false claim by the church . 
  unfortunately , it wo n't . 
  for infrastructure , we could get the eu funds . 
  however , we do n't , because our politicians prefer to use local money for such `` investment '' , which can be siphoned into their pockets . 
  eu money tends to come with strings attached : the eu audits wo n't allow this blatant theft . 
  for extreme poverty , no one seems to care . 
  the government pays some social benefits worth 25 $ / person/month ( in some areas , they have to do some community work in order to get that money ) and the eu has a program of giving some free basic foodstuff ( flour , sugar , cooking oil , etc ) for them . 
  this helps them survive , but that 's it . 
  romanian media does n't seem to care , because many of the people in extreme poverty are roma/gypsies and racism is probably worse than anywhere in europe . 
  the arguments supporting no social programs tend to be along the lines of `` gypsy thieves deserve nothing better '' , `` lazy people '' or `` they should get a job '' , even though it 's obvious that in some areas , not even those 150 $ / month minimum wage jobs are available .
