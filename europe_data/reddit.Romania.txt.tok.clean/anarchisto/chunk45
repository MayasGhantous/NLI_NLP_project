  the eu does have `` integration '' programs , but i have yet to hear about a success story . 
  all i hear is graft or people with neonazi opinions doing gypsy integration programs . 
  for underfunded hospitals , the obvious solution would be to increase funding ( we currently have the lowest healthcare spending as percentage of gdp in the eu ) . 
  however there 's this idea looming about privatizing hospitals and using private insurance companies . 
  of course , this would mean far better services for the top 5 % ( who can afford such services ) and worse services ( or at least , worse coverage ) for the rest of 95 % . 
  i see way too often the `` lazy people do n't deserve healthcare '' argument . 
  if by fiscal responsibility you mean bad infrastructure , [ extreme poverty ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/usr/thumbs/thumb_506_x_340/2010/08/21//139778-romi.jpg ) and [ underfunded hospitals ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sieusddb7ds/tamoydsyiji/aaaaaaaaali/j85ipb5ubj0/s1600/spital.jpg ) , i do n't want any . 
  [ that flag is what they see out the window during the winter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eesti_lipp.jpg ), 
   the carabiniere ( a member of a sort of police branch of the army ) , which is stereotypically considered a simpleton or straight dumb . 
  a year ago , as a tourist in rome , around the colosseum , i saw a carabinieri car speeding up , toward some africans selling trinkets . 
  those africans ran away fast , jumping a fence and climbing a slope , narrowly escaped being hit by that police car , which screeched its brakes when it reached the edge of the road . 
  after that , they just got out of the car and laughed at the scared africans . 
  some more details : * oltenia : stupid , but they think they are very ingenious and inventive * moldavia : poor and alcoholic * transylvania : patriarchal ( shepherds , sheep shaggers , etc ) , very slow ( both in thinking and acting ) , drink palinc\u0103 / palinka that is much stronger than what 's produced in the other areas of course , most common jokes are about the oltenians . 
  some samples : -- * how do the oltenians build a fence ? 
  * they put two stakes and then they write `` etc. '', 
  -- * why do the oltenian men wear checkered shirts ? 
  * so they can ask their wife `` scratch me at h3 ! '', 
  -- * why do the oltenians put their clocks on their windows ? 
  * so they can see how time flies . 
  -- * why do n't the oltenians practice waterskiing ? 
  * they have no lake with a slope . 
  -- * why do the oltenians sleep on the soil ? 
  * so they become more cultivated . 
  we had the same thing in romania . 
  romania 's peak population was 23.2 million in 1990 . 
  in 2011 , there were only 18.3 million people who were living permanently in romania . 
  almost 5 million people lost in 20 years , most of them to other eu countries . 
  do we have a more competent government ? 
  definitely not . 
  i do n't think the catalans will be cowed by the madrid bullies . 
   would do best for greece . 
  if the minimum wage is lowered , more working-age people will simply leave the country to work for the minimum wages in other eu countries . 
  this has already happened in poland , in romania , in bulgaria , etc. 
  the government will get fewer taxes and it would make the debt less manageable . 
  yes , that 's best for greece . 
  i can see some intense competition for bakers : there can be dozens of bakeries around and dozens of other brands of bread you can buy in supermarkets . 
  this competition is good for the customer . 
  but there 's little competition for telecom companies . 
  where i live , there are only two companies with wide coverage across the country : vodafone and orange . 
  they have basically the same prices , similar quality , etc. 
  you basically choose whether you like red or orange . 
  they do n't appear to try to take each other 's customers : they 're happy with the profit margin . 
  the prices for data roaming are absurdly high . 
  there is absolutely no reason , technical or otherwise , for vodafone to charge me 100 times more if i cross the border into hungary ( and using the services of vodafone hungary ) than when i 'm in romania . 
   just support those companies that do not charge roaming fees and stop supporting those who charges them . 
  if all companies charge roaming fees , whom should i support ? 
  the republic of cyprus, 
  the only connection i can see is that he studied at the pontifical biblical institute in rome . 
  the problems with traceability have been known for a long time . 
  it 's not like it never happened that a horse/cow/whatever that was supposed to be sacrificed , according to the paper trail , to be found roaming across the countryside . 
  great !, 
  am i the only atheist who enjoys papal elections ? 
  nobody expects the [ sacred congregation for the doctrine of the faith ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_ratzinger_as_prefect_of_the_congregation_for_the_doctrine_of_the_faith ) . 
   the standards of living and the standards of their benefits schemes vary wildly between eu nations . 
  i thought that one of the goals of the eu was to have equal economic development/standards of living . 
  the schemes can be standardized , if there is enough will . 
   so i was wondering what you guys think about the demographic crisis europe is suffering right now . 
  in romania , we face an overwhelming outward migration . 
  millions of ( mostly young ) romanians left already for better-paid positions in western europe . 
  in italy alone , there are over a million romanian citizens . 
  i 'm not complaining about this : they have better perspectives there and i do n't see a point in our nationalists ' cries about how they 'll be assimilated and cease to be romanians . 
  nevertheless , i see a worrying trend : if millions of people from eastern europe in their 20s and 30s leave ( the same is valid for poland , bulgaria , etc ) , there 's an even more serious demographic crisis here than in western europe . 
  if most young people leave and the older people stay behind , how is our social-security system going to work ? 
  we already have more pensioneers than employed people . 
  the only solution for this would be to have a common eu-wide social security pool , but i know that this will not be accepted easily by the western countries . 
  maybe i 'm a gypsy too , and i want my kind to conquer your people . 
  today romania , tomorrow the world !, 
   that would mean we would have to give gypsies the entire country . 
  are the roma people the majority in the entire country ? 
  if we exclude the romanian-inhabited villages of harghita and covasna , the hungarian-inhabited area has ~ 95 % hungarians . 
  is this the same as the 5-10 % roma people elsewhere ? 
  no one is asking autonomy for 100-people villages . 
  the szekely are a special case because they are a 700.000-people nation living in a compact and homogenous area . 
   hey everyone , catalonia ca n't use its own flag cause they 're spanish !, 
  in catalonia , the local authorities fly the [ catalan province flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/flag_of_catalonia.svg/210px-flag_of_catalonia.svg.png ) , not the '' [ senyera estelada ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--lpxdhwkmo4/t8yscy8nshi/aaaaaaaaa9u/uqshnvamcww/s1600/estelada.png ) '' ( independent catalunya flag , the one with the star ) . 
  also , it 's not a human right to fly a flag inside government buildings . 
  the arguments against giving them autonomy are : * `` our ancestors died fighting austria-hungary '' -- of course , they died for liberating the areas inhabited by romanians , the szkeler enclave was included because it 's an enclave , not because it was `` romanian land '' . 
  * `` the romanian minority in szekeler land '' -- the argument goes that the romanian minority will be oppressed , but , that 's nonsense , as they could be granted the same rights which the hungarian minority have in the rest of romania . 
  ( education , using their maternal language in dealing with the local authorities , etc ) * `` the szekely came here after us '' -- they came here 1000 years ago and the area was n't inhabited by romanians before that . 
  in some areas of romania , there were no romanians at all until 150 years ago . 
  should dobruja be given back to the ottomans ? 
  * `` the constitution says we have a unitary state '' -- the constitution can be changed . 
   we support our own agriculture , we do n't use funds from other nations there are us states that pay more than they get back in subsidies and states that benefit from the subsidies ( iowa , for instance ) . 
   i feel that scotland is a predominantly left wing country and england is a predominantly right wing country imo , this is probably the most powerful argument in all this debate . 
   problems with flooding . 
  probably it has something to do with the submarine 's sinks . 
  `` ironhead '' actually sounds like a cool name . 
  i 'd be more embarassed by a name like p\u0103s\u0103ric\u0103 ( `` pussy '' , literally birdie ) or curu\u021b ( can be understood as smallarse , but its actual etymology is ultimately from german kreuz [ fahrer ] , `` crusader '' ), 
  is n't that the logo of winamp ? 
  that was just an example , but which i found an illustration quite good for the kind of mentality in greece . 
  it 's not hard to see that this is the prevalent mentality in greece . 
  the people of greece gave up the fight for their country and accepted whatever imf and eu are telling them . 
  young people now prefer to leave the country instead of fighting for something better than the deal they got . 
  of course there are some exceptions , but i feel that they 're only that , exceptions . 
  otherwise , they could n't have made a whole country accept those terms . 
  westernized ? 
  czech republic 2 . 
  slovenia easternized ? 
  greece . 
  why greece ?
