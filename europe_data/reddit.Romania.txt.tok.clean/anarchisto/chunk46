  italy is probably as corrupt as greece and you can definitely find more left-wing `` communists '' in france than in greece , portugal was slightly poorer than greece , but that 's not how i define the eastern block . 
  i was talking to a left-wing greek who opposed grassroot organizations such as `` clean up my country '' , in which hundreds of thousands of volunteers clean up natural areas . 
  he opposed them , saying that the state should do it and that anyway people ca n't change much . 
  `` i do n't care , that 's not my problem '' is probably the quintessence of eastern block countries . 
  people are complacent into thinking that they ca n't change anything , so they wo n't even be bothered to try . 
  inequality is not a problem or is it included in `` poverty '' ? 
  sexism is widespread and it 's publicly acceptable for romanian politicians to disparage women . 
  only 7 % of romania 's members of the senate are women , the lowest percentage of any eu country 's parliament . 
  ( 13 % for the lower chamber ), 
  the same thing is valid for crystalline silicon . 
  the disease is called [ silicosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silicosis ) . 
  that would work great against the last uk 's campaign in romania : '' [ we want to send out a clear message that britain is one of the very best places in the world to visit , live , work , study , invest and do business . 
  ] ( http://ukinromania.fco.gov.uk/en/visit-uk/great-campaign/757107482/ ) '', 
  same for romania . 
  out of 20 million people , about 4 million are living abroad . 
  in some rural areas , only the old people stayed behind . 
  however , here , all kinds of people left , from highly skilled people ( i have a few friends who moved to the us to work at facebook and google ) to technicians ( i have an uncle working in industry in the basque country ) to blue-collar workers ( i have a second-cousin who worked as a plumber in spain ) to the lumpens ( especially roma/gypsy people who live across europe ) . 
  bucharest is probably the only place booming and a few cities struggling . 
  the rest of the country is going down and it 's getting depopulated . 
  but the eu is to blame for everything . 
   the required minimum net stadiums capacities should be :   \u2022 70,000 for semi-finals/final ;   \u2022 60,000 for quarter-finals ;   ferenc pusk\u00e1s stadium - capacity : 56,000 sorry , son , but no !, 
  what to expect in each city : * berlin : weed , startups , technology , alternative culture , parties * copenhagen : weed , anarchists , technology * amsterdam : weed , tourists , technology , alternative culture , parties * prague : weed , tourists , history , parties * vienna : tourists , caf\u00e9s , intellectual feeling , history probably berlin is the closest in culture to san francisco . 
  [ note , i 've never been to berlin , but i 've been to sf ], 
  we have plenty of minimum wage jobs . 
  160 $ / month . 
  euro-skeptics probably use socialist as an expletive . 
  [ where draughts are truly dangerous ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/4197177/where-draughts-are-truly-dangerous.html )  in romania , the greatest threat to life today is not poverty , climate change or al-qa ` eda . 
  it 's moving air . 
  [ ... ]   i first noticed this phenomenon last summer . 
  romania has extreme , continental weather , and i suggested to my romanian boyfriend - quite reasonably , i thought - that we purchase a fan . 
  he shifted uncomfortably , which , given that we were sweltering through every night in a stuffy room , i found odd . 
  nonetheless i persisted , and after a few abortive trips to the department store , a fan was acquired . 
    yet this was just half the battle , as i then found vasile showing extreme resistance to turning the fan on , but hesitating to offer an explanation . 
  and i observed similar strange behaviour elsewhere . 
  both at home and work , panic would break out if ever two windows , or a window and a door , were open simultaneously , and somebody would race to close one , wailing ** `` cur-rent !, 
  '' **  [ ... ]   recently my boyfriend read his parents an article in a newspaper written by a doctor , headlined `` sitting in a draught does not cause toothache . '', 
  they muttered , suspiciously . 
  i told them that i , and many of my compatriots , actively seek out a draught when we are hot , and that we are all in rude health . 
  this , i was told , was due to the ** in-built english resistance to draughts ** . 
  the tariff for importing maple syrup from canada into the eu is currently 8 % , so it 's not going to be much cheaper . 
  we had years with inflation as low as 3 % ( in 2011 ) and years with 7-8 % . 
  anyway , even if we had 100 % inflation , it 's not even close to the 584 % increase . 
  it 's a mix of several factors , including : * yearly , it gets [ $ 20-25 million in profits ] ( http://www.zf.ro/mediafax-biz-exclusiv/apa-nova-afaceri-de-100-mil-euro-si-marja-de-profit-de-20-8172857/ ) ( about 20-25 % of the its revenue ) . 
  * their main cost is electricity ( for pumps , filters , etc ) , the price of which increased by a similar percentage following the deregulation of the electricity market ( required by the eu ) . 
  here 's the checklist in romania : * privatization of oil resources - omv [ austria ] * privatization of water - veolia [ france ] * privatization of gas distribution - gdf suez [ france ] , e.on [ germany ] * privatization of rubbish collection - many local companies * privatization of electricity distribution - enel [ italy ] * privatization of phone company - ote [ greece , itself bought by d-telekom ] * privatization of marble and stone - titan mar [ romania ; owned by a politician ] * privatization of mines - lots of companies , many from australia and canada -- * privatization of post offices - ongoing ; expected this year ; imf demand * privatization of railroads - expected this year ; imf demand * privatization of healthcare - blocked following protests ; expected next year * privatization of hydro and nuclear plants - expected soon , government plan published, 
  but nevertheless , the prices did jump from 0.7 lei/cubic meter in 2001 ( when it was state-owned ) to [ 4.79 lei ] ( http://www.apanovabucuresti.ro/info-consumator/despre-factura-tarife-si-plata-serviciilor/tarife/ ) currently . 
  the cumulative inflation was a bit over 50 % . 
  the increase in the price of water was 584 % . 
  in romania , we already privatized it . 
  in bucharest , the lucky winner was veolia . 
  in the last few years , we had a 5-times growth in price per cubic meter of water . 
  i think it 's adolf , not maltus . 
  it depends * which * right-wing . 
  the mainstream right-wing party ( democratic-liberals ) are very pro-free-market . 
  the fringe parties ( like greater romania or people 's party ) mix nationalism with some socialist ideas ; in the case of greater romania , i 'd argue that the ideology is basically some `` modernized '' ceau\u0219escuism . 
  well , as a left-winger , i agree that they do not cooperate with the leftist parties in romania because they 're not really left-wing , they just pretend to be . 
  each of the members of that funda\u021bia cre\u0219tin-democrat\u0103 held some grudge against some group . 
  usually it 's the roma or the atheists . 
  they claim to promote european values , but they cherry-pick which values they support and tolerance and equality are not among them : * baconschi ( president of the fcd ) called the roma people `` innate criminals '' ( being warned by tha anti-discrimination council for this ) * adrian papahagi ( vice-president of the fcd ) is constantly attacking the only open atheist in romanian politics ( remus cernea ) for his lack of religious beliefs , claiming that being part of the government was a victory for `` militant atheism '' ; he famously said that having our current prime minister ( ponta ) is almost as bad as having an atheist lesbian gypsy as prime-minister , thus being homophobic , racist , sexist and religious intolerant in one sentence . 
  * mihail neam\u021bu ( founding member of the fcd ) was a neonazi in his young days , he claims now that he was just young and foolish , but he occasionally does touch his old ideas ; last thing was a couple of months when he caused quite a fuss from the jewish organizations after quoting a fascist poet ; neam\u021bu was also active countering what he calls the `` gay agenda '' ( a term probably borrowed from the us ) and he often repeated how disgusted he is when he sees gays kissing on the street in germany or the gay pride parade in bucharest . 
  these cases were those which were reported in the romanian press , but if i look in their blogs and facebook pages , i can find more . 
   here in romania , it is hard to find anybody who speaks english at all . 
  the german is much more popular . 
  `` here '' means probably transylvania , right ? 
  in bucharest , english is the only language that matters nowadays . 
  we have a lot of multinationals , some of them bringing their ex-pat workers here and bilingual working environments are n't that uncommon . 
   actually , english was perhaps the most taught foreign language since at least the seventies . 
  no , in the 70s , french was still the most taught ; only in the 1990s , english surpassed it . 
  my father ( in bucharest ) studied french - english , while my mother ( in t\u00e2rgovi\u0219te ) studied french - german . 
  but yes , russian was quite commonly taught as well . 
  the average blue-collar worker might not know english , but i do n't think it 's easy to find a white-collar job without knowing english . 
   the first and the last are most likely active in romania , too . 
  i googled for a bit and these were the results : the rosa luxemburg foundation 's activity in romania was mostly about the social situation of the roma and promoting their rights , social inclusion , etc. 
  without touching any hard politics . 
  the friedrich ebert foundation does seem to be involved in a variety of interesting projects ( empowering women , citizen initiatives , participatory democracy , the right to protest , alternative media , etc ) , but , unlike the right-wing foundations , they do n't support any local party . 
  there is an `` alternative media '' website , criticatac , that is partly financed by them , but again , neither this website supported or had any links to any political party during the last elections . 
  the prevailing view was `` the difference between the two choices is so small that we might as well stay at home '' . 
   romania is in dire need of western `` agenda '' to foster a closer relationship with democracy , transparency and accountability . 
  yes , i agree , but my problem is not with the idea of a foundation promoting european and democratic values ; my problem is that the romanians who are sponsored by the cdu are promoting values that are contrary to those european values : full of homophobia , `` atheists are evil and dangerous people '' , racism , gypsy hating , etc. 
  i 'm not even veering into corruption ... 
  it seems to me that cdu is sponsoring them just because they agree with their economic libertarian ideas . 
  they do n't care about any other issue . 
  in the big cities , most people are n't very religious , but there are n't many to wo n't come out as atheists/agnostics , either . 
  the most common attitude is just ignoring it altogether . 
  most people go to church once a year , on easter and they also go on the occasional wedding and baptism , but not to the sunday prayers . 
  in the rural areas , the prestige of the church is still high and people are more religious , although lately , a feeling of discontent with church policies reached even there . 
  elderly people go to church , if not every week , usually at least once a month . 
  so , i guess the answer is that there might be some people who believe this , but not that many . 
  their websites . 
   germany 's political foundations are very largely financed by federal and land government funds . 
  96.8 % of the konrad-adenauer-stiftung 's funds come from public remittances , while 2.7 % are derived from admission charges and miscellaneous revenues . 
  in addition , private revenues ( income from funds and donations ) account for another 0.5 % [ source ] ( http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.3712/ ), 
  the orthodox church is autonomous , meaning that the state can not decide for the orthodox church , not that it does n't get money from the state . 
  the contributions of the state to the orthodox include : * paying the salaries of the recognized churches employees ( both clerical and non-clerical ) ; see [ law 142/1999 ] ( http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/legea_salarizare_cler.php ) . 
  in all , 60,000 employees . 
  * general funds given to the churches ( proportional to the number of adherents at the last census ) * funds for building and renovating churches funds can be given by government at all levels , but usually county and municipalities/communes give to local churches . 
  oh , my bad , then . 
   c ) they are reactionary right-wings it 's not fair to call a whole 80-million people nation `` reactionary right-wingers '' . 
  stereotyping does n't help anything . 
   are they free to choose whether support this or not ?
