  part of my tax money goes to the church and i 'm not asked about this . 
   this is happening everywhere and you should be glad that the church is actually willing to participate they do n't mean that the church would use its own money for that . 
  they mean that the government would pay the church to do social security and healthcare-related functions . 
  well , herta m\u00fcller 's writings have a rather limited appeal , so i would n't recommend her writings unless you are really into this kind of literature ( about dissent , dictatorships , etc ) . 
  for romanian literature , i 'd argue that the most important novel would be ** marin preda ** 's * morome\u021bii * ( the moromete family ) , a book about a traditional family and its village during the interwar era and , in the second volume , early communist era . 
  for poetry , many romanians might say they like the romantic-era ** mihai eminescu ** , but i like ** nichita st\u0103nescu ** 's poetry better . 
  the most internationally-acclaimed playwright is definitely ** eug\u00e8ne ionesco ** , but satirical politics-inspired comedies of ** ion luca caragiale ** are quite popular in romania , too . 
  during the interwar period , we had a quite active avant-garde movement . 
  absurd poetry and prose ( ** urmuz ** ) , revolutionary art movements ( ** tristan tzara ** and the dada movement ) and sometimes outright art trolling ( the gnaa would be proud of them ) . 
   too little tax ? 
  you have to be kidding me !, 
    the standard income tax rate is rising from 24.5 % to 28.5 % . 
  in scandinavia , they 're around 40-50 % . 
   that 's all there is to it , on the one hand you have balanced budgets and deficits under control and on the other you have unbalanced budgets and public debt getting out of control , the consequences of these two situations now having their consequences . 
  i never said to spend out of control , i argued that there 's way too little taken in tax by the southern european countries . 
   yeah , i 'd suggest that people who work overtime and are n't paid to renegotiate their contracts . 
  ... and then you 're fired and a peon who does n't complain gets hired in your place , for less than what you make . 
   if we were to , among other things , lower taxes to levels comparable to those of northern europe lower taxes ? 
  but in northern europe , taxes are much higher than in southern europe . 
  why scandinavian countries are doing well despite their taxes being almost 50 % of the gdp ? 
  why portugal is doing quite badly while having its taxes at [ around 20 % of gdp ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/government+tax+revenue+as+a+percentage+of+gdp+budget+execution-838 ) ? 
  i hear this neoliberal `` because southern european are lazy , while the northern europeans are hard-working '' , but that 's not really true . 
  i 'm not saying that nordic people are not hard-working , just that they do n't work more than the southerners . 
  in nordic countries , you 're paid 8 hours , you work 8 hours . 
  but in some parts of southern europe , it 's expected for you to stay late at work , to do unpaid overtime . 
  the private sector does n't live in a vacuum , separated from the rest of the economy : it gets its money from private customers or the government . 
  if there is austerity : * people get fired from both government jobs and from private companies ; these people can not afford to buy things that the private sector produces * people who are not fired , seeing other people getting fired , think they could be next in the line , so they save more rather than buy ; these people will buy fewer things that the private sector produces * the government no longer buys things and services from private companies ( austerity ) . 
  people get fired from those private companies ( lack of demand for their products ) and they no longer buy things that other private companies produce . 
  for every euro that the state cuts in spending , another 5 $ ( it may be as low as 3 $ or as high as 7 $ , depending on the economy ) is lost from the gdp of the country . 
  and the problems is not just that decrease in gdp ( that is very obvious in greece ) or that private companies go bankrupt due to lack of demand from customers . 
  it 's that it 's a vicious cycle : after a couple of years of austerity , the economic climate will become so bad that the government needs more austerity , leading to an even worse economic climate . 
   we have n't been hit in any substantial way by the euro crisis until a month or two back you were n't hit by austerity as soon as the other eu countries . 
  unemployment at a new high ? 
  we need more austerity and cuts !, 
  the medieval practice of bloodletting often weakened the body of the patient , but have no fear , the physician said that you need even more bloodletting !, 
  just because they 're gypsies it does n't mean they 're less human . 
  yes , there 's a serious social issue which should be solved at european level ( and unfortunately the attempts have n't been very efficient ) , but racism is the least thing we need . 
   there 's a reason why we outsource call centers and line manufacturing , but not entire r&d departments . 
  actually , entire r&d departments can be outsourced and they are outsourced . 
  here in bucharest , it 's mostly software outsourcing ( i work for a nordic company that has r&d offices here ) , but there 's plenty of industrial engineering outsourced as well . 
   they generate less value with the same amount of time/work , thus the market rewards them with less money . 
  what you say is correct , but what i mean is that it 's not the workers ' fault that they get to live in a less developed country . 
  i just mean that we should not look at the workers when we want to find someone to blame . 
  and even if they generate the same value with the same amount of time/work , the pay scale is different . 
  the same auto industry worker would get ( after taxes ) 2000 $ in france , 500 $ in romania , 250 $ in morocco and 100 $ in india . 
  also , the productivity in some fields drips down to other fields as well . 
  a barber in germany is n't producing 50 times more haircuts than a barber in india . 
  whenever there is a crisis in any country , i see their economic/political elite , the media and , of course , people from other countries blaming the common folks . 
  they 're lazy , they 're not working enough , they 're taking too many benefits and , as a combination of all those , they 're not productive enough . 
  nowadays , productivity has little to do with how hard-working are the workers . 
  it is all about technology . 
  the average swedish industrial worker produces 50 times the value that the average indian worker produces not because he 's more hard-working ( it 's likely the other way around , as workers less developed countries work more hours ) , but because he uses better technology . 
  and this is not the fault of the indian , nor the merit of the swede . 
  [ oops .

  eastern turkey should be part of kurdistan anyway , 
   well if denmark , norway , and sweden united we 'd need a lingua franca , and while at the moment that 's english i thought that you can understand each other if you each speak in your own language . 
   i 'd be pretty annoyed if it meant i 'd have to learn swedish . 
  i 'm sure that the rest of the scandinavians would be more annoyed if they 'd have to learn danish . 
  greeks and turks are more similar in mentality , culture and cuisine than either of them likes to admit . 
  rule by decree has a long `` tradition '' in russia : the tsars did it , lenin did it , stalin did it , gorbachev did it ( to pass pass the transition to capitalism laws ) , etc. 
   well , i ca n't imagine this doing that well for his reputation . 
  he peed on a carpet in a plane in front of rest of the other passengers , he does n't care about his reputation . 
   in a way , he makes money from the simple fact that he is famous . 
  he is famous thanks in part to the french government , which not only that paid a lot of money in grants for those movies to be created in the first place , but it also often paid 1/3 of the promotion costs for the movies . 
  much of depardieu 's wealth ( $ 150 milion ) comes from the french state , which is generously giving grants to film companies to continue fueling the `` exception culturelle fran\u00e7aise '' . 
  so mr. depardieu is happy to get money from the state , but he 's not willing to give a fair share back as taxes . 
  one solution would be for the state to give funding only to films which pay their actors less than 500,000 $ each . 
  i guess that if you have enough money to pay for top actors , you do n't need money from the state . 
  there are plenty of good actors who are willing to do it for this sum . 
  they 're not `` famous '' , but that 's not the important thing . 
  they knew that their politicians were corrupt ( afterall , even before the crisis , their corruption perception was worst in the eu , behind romania , italy and bulgaria ) , but they never thought that they were this harmful to their economy and well-being . 
   that is good , considering that greece has become more corrupt in the last year actually , with the crisis , they 've become more aware of the corruption in their country . 
  the top is based on the perception of corruption , not the actual level of corruption . 
  also known as `` european union lite '' . 
   the oil certainly helped making us as well off as we are , but i do n't think it 's fair to point at it when explaining the low unemployment . 
  oil revenue allowed the government to have a budget surplus even during the crisis , so cuts were n't needed like in the other countries . 
  also , from what i understand about the norwegian economy , oil jobs brought up wages , making it relatively cheaper to automate things , leading to a pretty developed high-tech industry . 
  romania : virtually all doctors and nurses within the state hospital system receive informal payments from patients . 
  in many cases , it 's required and paid in advance , as the doctors and nurses would ilegally refuse treatment if they do n't receive any money , this is especially true for surgery or giving birth . 
  in surgery , the sums required by the doctors often reach thousands of euros . 
  in hospitals , the nurses refuse to give any attention to patients who do n't give them any money , or if they are forced to do it , they do their job badly , like intentionally inflicting pain when giving an injection . 
  as a case i know , a second degree cousin of mine had a serious complication during childbirth and the child died , while she was left in critical state . 
  the doctor at t\u00e2rgovi\u0219te hospital hinted that unless the family would pay a sum , she could die , too . 
  the alternative for `` state-funded '' medicine are private practices and hospitals , but probably less than 5 % of the population can afford it , and even if you afford it , they have inadequate equipment . 
  the politicians ( including our president ) typically fly to austria , germany or france for any surgery or other medical intervention . 
  the salaries of the doctors and nurses are very low , leading to a large `` brain drain '' of the doctors toward west ( especially france , which has a shortage for countryside doctors which has been filled with romanians ) . 
  in fact , the whole system is understaffed and underfunded , as a result of having the lowest percentage of gdp in europe given to medicine . 
  their unemployment rate is n't related to the eu membership but rather to the fact that they were the only countries not to suffer any austerity measures from their government . 
  the best example is norway vs. denmark . 
  similar countries as culture , both had equally strong economies , but after 2008 , denmark had a [ very tough austerity policy ] ( http://www.marxist.com/denmark-huge-mobilisation-against-austerity-measures.htm ) , while norway did n't . 
  denmark 's unemployment rate went up from 3.17 % ( similar to norway 's ) in 2008 to 8 % in 2012 . 
  ( see [ the line chart ] ( http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?series_key=132.sts.m.dk.s.uneh.rtt000.4.000 ) at the european central bank ), 
   the uk has petrol in the shetland islands . 
  scotland has petrol in the shetland islands . 
  even if scotland 's independence referendum will fail , the scots are less willing to share their oil wealth with london . 
  indeed . 
  in romania , the suicide rate by county is roughly proportional to the percentage of hungarians in each county . 
   not even anything can stop unemployment . 
  the only european countries with full employment or near it ( defined as unemployment rate lower than 3 % ) are norway ( 3 % ) and switzerland ( 3.1 % ) .
