  they ca n't be used as models for the rest of europe because they are small , rich countries with a special asset ( oil in norway , banking in switzerland ) . 
  well , she did ( in ) famously claim that `` there 's no such thing as society , there are just individuals '' . 
   give a totally false impression . 
  a totally false impression of what ? 
  her plans of disbanding `` society '' ? 
  this plan is just a step further than what she did achieve . 
  she would have taken more `` radical '' ( i.e. 
  taking away more social security rights ) if she had the chance . 
   thatcher said she was horrified by it she was horrified by the prospect of such a plan leaking ( and thus the damage to her image ) , not by the plan itself . 
  at least that 's what i understand from the quote from her autobiography . 
   it 's perfectly right and proper to encourage at least thinking about all achievable policy options when considering the long-term future of social policy . 
  that 's pretending that the social policies that these think tanks propose is apolitical ... 
   i believe you mean our francophilic period . 
  francophilia was in the old kingdom ( wallachia and moldavia ) . 
  latinism was in transylvania . 
   claiming the word is of slavic/turkish/hungarian / greek/albanian origin whenever a latin etymon can not be found , when a word is found in all turkic languages ( even as far as turkic people in siberia ) , it 's clearly not a balkanian word . 
  it 's a turkish word . 
  when a word is found in all slavic languages ( even as far as czechia and russia ) , it 's clearly not a balkanian word . 
  it 's a slavic word . 
  etc, 
  because in the first case , the western weapons manufacturer is n't getting any new orders and the invaded country 's natural resources are n't `` bought '' by some western multinational . 
  the difference between the two is that in the second case , someone is getting rich . 
  yes , bad people , but bad people in a country which nato invaded . 
  and like most `` peacekeeping '' invasions ( including iraq ) , the cure is worse than the disease . 
   it is reassuring to know that they are out there doing stuff . 
  so it is reassuring to know that they are out there killing people ? 
  in romania , some food is slightly more expensive than in germany . 
  the reason is that the vat for food in romania is 24 % ; in germany , it 's 7 % . 
  i 'm not sure what 's the case in lithuania , but it could be something similar . 
  a romanian magazine noticed that out of the top 300 richest romanians , about 80 % are either former securitate officers , informers or part of the nomenklatura . 
  btw , no securitate officer was ever arrested for his crimes . 
  in romania : * collaboration with the securitate ( former communist-era secret police ) , especially the informants and securitate officers that are now office-holders * privatization of the healthcare system ( the previous government tried to do it , resulting in protests ; this government will probably try again -- it 's a lot of money to be won by some corporations ) * strip mining of gold using cyanides in the hills of [ ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 ] ( http://www.badpolitics.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rosia_montana.jpg ) ( the canadian company doing this `` bought '' our whole press , so you wo n't find in the press any articles opposing it ) * corruption , kickbacks , bribes , etc. 
  -- every other week we have another corruption scandal ... 
   wikipedia is flooded with fiery arguments from both sides it 's a war on wikipedia . 
  a real war . 
  once upon a time , balkanians took their rifle , their helmet and started shooting their neighbours . 
  now they do the same thing on wikipedia . 
  what about the [ balkan federation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_federation ) ? 
  we should get used to high unemployment rate as the work efficiency keeps increasing due to software/automation and the consumption does not increase at the same rate . 
  the near-record high unemployment in the us , the huge youth unemployment (  50 % ) and overall unemployment (  25 % ) in southern europe and the increase of unemployment in the rest of the world are just the beginning . 
  we either need to : * reduce weekly/daily work time so more people have the chance to get to work * increase personal consumption , but this might require some income redistribution and has some ecological limits . 
  * increase state 's consumption ( through providing social services ) , which requires higher taxes * change the economic paradigm altogether neither of this will happen , so we 'll just have to wait for things to break apart before acting . 
  for now , the only countries which have a lower unemployment rate are those more egalitarian in incomes and/or with high state consumption for social services , that is scandinavia . 
  ** bozgor ** , a pejorative word in romanian meaning `` hungarian '' . 
  uncertain etymology . 
  quite a few etymologies were proposed , including : * romanian a boscorodi ( to mumble , to babble , to speak nonsense ) * hungarian [ bocskor ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bocskor ) , some hungarian sandals . 
  * slavic bez-gora ( without mountains ) , refering to the hungarian steppe ( the puszta ), 
  they 're spending tens of billions of dollars in building universities and `` research centers '' and paying a lot of money to get foreign professors and researchers . 
  they hope to improve their education so that their people would one day do some research as well . 
  with enough money , you can buy anything , including researchers to come and do research in your university . 
  it helps that their sale tax is very low , when compared to our vat . 
   something like the friendliness of the people would fit the us better for me as a unique best thing . 
  people are friendly in small towns and less friendly in big cities ( valid everywhere , from paris to nyc ) . 
  also , in europe , there 's a huge difference between the north and the south . 
  in the south , it 's very common to start talking to other people in the public transport . 
  in italy and spain , i 've seen people talk about their personal issues , argue about politics ( for instance , a catalan vs. spaniard conversation in mallorca ) or have a conversation about every possible topic . 
  a norwegian co-worker said that norwegians think that a person who 'd try to talk to you in a bus is insane . 
  which is the best and which is the worst ? 
   i would say the consumer culture gives me quick , easy , cheap access to virtually anything i could need i do n't think that there 's a big difference between the goods available in the us and those available in europe . 
  we get better quality food in the eu and you get slightly lower prices . 
  [ what do you prefer : a bit of inflation or dying ? ], 
  i think he 's right that we have to choose between austerity ( resulting in closing down entire industries and in some cases , bringing down entire countries ' economies ) and a bit of inflation ... 
  but it 's not us to decide anyway . 
  the second variant will be chosen regardless of whom we 'll vote because that 's the variant that brings the largest profits to the financial industry , the only industry that matters nowadays . 
  there 's a [ `` mare\u0219al j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski '' street ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=strada+polon%c4%83,+bucharest,+romania&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=44.446404,26.103188&amp;spn=0.003018,0.006947&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=54.22533,113.818359&amp;oq=str.+polon&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=strada+polon%c4%83,+bucure%c8%99ti,+romania&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.446379,26.103376&amp;panoid=4z3yjygssxuhy-2yuvkm4q&amp;cbp=12,254.06,,0,-0.07 ) here in bucharest close to where i live . 
  initially , it had a plaque saying pi\u0142sudski with the right diacritics , but now they replaced it with a brand new one missing the polish diacritics : `` mare\u0219al jozef pilsudski '' . 
  i keep thinking about using some white correction fluid to add the missing diacritics . 
  power to the diacritics !, 
  i support kog\u0103lniceanu as well . 
  cuza also had some great reforms ( confiscating monasteries ' lands and removing remaining feudal privileges ) , but done in an authoritarian fashion , which also led to his downfall . 
  i think the problem is not with the amount of europe , but with the amount of democracy in europe . 
  the solution would be to give the power to the european parliament and a real european government would be voted by the parliament . 
  i also want eu-wide parties , but one step at a time . 
  why ? 
   some of my best school memories . 
  there 's nothing more fun than the mix of vodka , ( black ) metal and algorithms !, 
  i misread that as serbian pentathlon . 
  ringier ag owns some tabloids or semi-tabloid newspapers here in romania , too . 
  they 're successful by having daily mail-style articles and that attitude . 
  the semi-tabloid ( evenimentul zilei ) claims to be `` right-wing '' , while the tabloid ( libertatea ) is the `` light fascism with boobs '' - kind of newspaper . 
  so racism is a newspaper policy , not a mistake of a low-level editor . 
   the average net salary was $ 347 at a company , one guy ( a manager ) earns $ 2000 . 
  one other guy ( a technician ) earns $ 380 . 
  another 9 people ( workers ) earn 160 $ . 
  the average is $ 347 , but how representative is it ? 
  of the eleven people working at the company , only two people get more than the average . 
  you should keep in mind that about 1/3 of the workers in romania get the minimum wage and that the median ( which is n't published by the institution of statistics , but it has been calculated from other statistics ) is a only bit over 200 $ . 
  i 'm not saying that there are n't relatively well-paid, 
  there 's a rule in understanding news reports . 
  if the title is a question , almost always the answer is `` no '' . 
  so you 're comparing free government-provided healthcare and education with extermination camps ? 
  strange view . 
   i 'm personally a proponent of social democracy or state socialism well , being from a former eastern bloc country , i 'm a bit wary about state socialism ( or at least the version implemented in the east ) because it can stifle entrepreneurship and you lose a lot of the flexibility of the economy . 
  of course , for big corporations/banks , it does n't matter if the owner is the state of some private shareholders , they will function the same way . 
   ( while keeping my mind open to going even further left ) . 
  i believe in a trial-and-error approach . 
  we know that social-democracy works . 
  after reaching that point , we need to see what gives positive results . 
  * you were born in a tax-funded hospital . 
  * you studied in tax-funded schools and universities .
