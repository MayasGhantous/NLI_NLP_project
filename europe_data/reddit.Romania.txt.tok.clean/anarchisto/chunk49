  * you go to work using tax-funded roads or tax-funded public transport * every piece of meat you eat has been checked by a tax-funded institution * if you travel , all the bridges and airports have been built by taxes etc what have the romans ever done for us ? 
  well , in a `` libertarian socialist '' utopia , not only that there 'd be no state , but also there 'd be no money to pay in tax . 
  however , i doubt that we can switch to such a system overnight . 
  i propose a gradual change rather than a revolution and until we abolish money , we need taxes . 
  also please note that the `` no taxes '' movements ( anarcho-capitalists and self-proclaimed `` libertarians '' ) have very little to nothing in common with libertarian socialists . 
  you know , there are many brands of anarchism , but the most common one in europe is called `` libertarian socialism '' . 
  anarchism refers to the lack of all-powerful rulers , not to the amount of tax i pay . 
  as a taxpayer , i have no control over how the tax i pay is spent and i think that 's wrong . 
   it is not in their primary interest to reduse costs . 
  that 's not their goal . 
  the goal should be a better life for all their citizens , not smaller taxes . 
   google 's taxes are not spent on war and wages of hypocrits . 
  by paying no tax , google 's shareholders get more money . 
  who are google 's shareholders ? 
  most of shares are owned by us financial institutions , the same institutions that invested a lot and own much of the us military-industrial complex . 
  the military-industrial complex which wanted continuous increase in the demand for their products ( military equipment ) , therefore creating the wars in iraq , afghanistan , etc. 
  less money paid in taxes in europe means more wars of the us . 
  [ note : institutional investors own 242 million shares of google out of 328 million total shares ; about three-quarters ], 
   how do they know at this point ? 
  racism and stereotypes . 
  yes , he was . 
  you have to remember that while he implemented his reforms , turkey was an one-party state . 
  he tried implementing pluralism , but had quite some problems because there were a lot who supported islamic principles , which were opposed to his whole ideology . 
  i see that the article basically says that : * people who voted left-wing voted corrupt politicians and former securitate members . 
  * the right-wing is full of corrupt and incompetent politicians . 
  * the people who stayed at home are just as guilty for the result ( they contributed to this result ) in conclusion , regardless of what we did , we 're guilty . 
   estonia : no . 
  i bet you 're doing this just to annoy the russians !, 
   looks like the women in a french gathering are getting their personal space invaded by men ... or the personal space of the men gets invaded by women . 
  anyway , if you were born into that culture , you would n't find it like that . 
  me too . 
  i 'll put it right next to the [ 2006 time man of the year ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/you_ ( time_person_of_the_year % 29 ) award . 
  not fair !, 
  i only get 1/10 the amount of peace prize you get . 
  * [ romania  ( http://www.econtext.ro/assets/620-pib%20pe%20cap%20de%20locuitor.jpg ) bucharest has a gdp/capita of 15,454 $ ; the least developed county , vaslui county has 2,975 $ , so bucharest produces about 5.2 times as much per capita . 
  ( these figures are nominal currency exchange figures , not ppp , which would be higher ) and what 's interesting is that in the last year , bucharest had 2.5 % growth , higher than the overall growth of the economy , of under 1 % . 
  if we were really `` competing '' with the indians , no european would have any job . 
  the average wage in india is around 50 $ / month , while the minimum wage was recently increased to 32 $ / month ( [ rs 115/day ] ( http://www.indianexpress.com/news/states-agree-to-minimum-wages/1009030 ) ) . 
  do you really think that we should get down to this level to be `` competitive '' with the indians ? 
  6.5 % nowadays . 
  it was about about 8 % in 1930 . 
   it 's simply a cultural matter based on women working and having a career , among other things . 
  so in sweden and france , women are not working nor having a career , right ? 
   setting minimum wage lower attracts foreign investment then why investors like countries like denmark , with their 3000 $ / month wages instead of romania with its 150 $ / month wage ? 
   a smart thing to do when you 're competing against chinese and indian workers we are not competing against chinese and indian workers . 
  that 's bullshit . 
   also , minimum wage is not supposed to have anything to do with the middle fucking class . 
  almost 40 % of romanian workers have the minimum wage . 
  a further 30 % have less twice the minimum wage . 
  that 's our `` middle class '' . 
   delirious . 
  you are delirious . 
  an ad hominem always helps . 
   the government should give the middle class . 
  the government ** sets ** the minimum wage and in romania , it 's awfully low . 
  if we were to have the same minimum wage as percentage of gdp/capita as france , we 'd have a minimum wage of : ( 8875/44007 ) * 1425.67 = 287 $ instead of 154 $ ( 700 ron ), 
  indeed . 
  well , in 1990 , iliescu promised his voters a scandinavian-style social-democracy . 
  pnl and pn\u021a-cd were afraid we were going to continue to be communist . 
  neither previsions came true . 
  iliescu & co just used the power to get money from the state for his newly-capitalist friends ... 
  if you want a higher birth rate , you need to give the middle class enough resources to raise a large family . 
  currently , with a median ( not average , but median ) wage of 250 $ , you ca n't raise two or three kids . 
  that 's the reason why the french have 2.0 kids , the norwegians 1.9 kids and romanians 1.3 kids . 
   even the fact that you attribute `` libertarianism '' to pdl and not to pnl libertarianism is not the same same as liberalism . 
   the fact that you attribute a political ideology to any of the political parties in romania i 'm just taking what they say . 
  they do have a libertarian discourse . 
  i 'm not accusing him of fascism , he 's not using enough nationalism to be one . 
  i blame the fact that he belonged to that neonazi organisation to his idiocy , not his ideology . 
  oh , great , downvotes , because it 's easier than bringing arguments . 
  mihail neam\u021bu ( one of the leaders of the ard ) when he was younger was a member in a neonazi organization and , a few weeks ago , he was in a scandal for quoting a fascist poet during one of his speeches . 
  anyway , he recently argued on his facebook page that : * the state should n't pay any pensions , because this way it would encourage higher birth rates : people would have more children so they 'll get money from them , not the state * the state should n't pay any maternity leave because this way , it encourages fathers ( who find the wife less attractive when pregnant ) to file for divorce because he knows she will have enough money to raise the child . 
  what kind of sick and twisted mind can think something like this ? 
   uneducated , lazy majority the right-wing pdl 's discourse is based on the idea that the majority of romanians are lazy ; that we are poor because we are lazy . 
  they keep repeating this again and again . 
  they are telling me that i 'm stupid and i 'm lazy and then they 're asking me to vote for them , as they 'll cure me of laziness . 
  some of them ( the hip young ones who read and have their facebook pages full of ayn rand quotations ) even say how they 're going to cure me of laziness : a radical libertarianism is the cure for laziness . 
  the kind of libertarianism in which the state wo n't intervene even if people literally starve . 
  the truth is that romanians want to work : * we have millions of working poor , they 're not poor because they do n't work hard ; many work from 5 am to late in the evening , for a miserable wage . 
  * millions of romanians who live on the minimum wage ( ~ 160 $ / month ) ; that 's not a livable wage . 
  if you get that income , your life is depressingly poor . 
  * the lazy `` welfare queens '' ( people living in areas so depressed that no jobs are available , including roma/gypsies ) in romania get 120 lei ( 26 $ / month ) . 
  * in many areas , not even minimum wage jobs are available and those people go abroad ; more than two million romanians are now working abroad , across the eu , doing `` dirty jobs '' . 
  many of them even have university education , but rather than starving at home , any job is good . 
   both sicilians and ligurians consider themselves italians . 
  not everyone . 
  there are sicilians who want independence . 
  of course they 're not ethnically italian , but their language is a dialect of standard italian . 
  also , catalan and spanish languages are quite different ; a better example would be croats/serbs and serbian/croatian language -- ethnically different people , almost the same language . 
   it 's a shitty system , everyone knows that , but nobody wants to propose another one . 
  here , in romania , they replaced this `` party list '' system with an even [ shitter one ] ( http://www.bucharestlife.net/2012/10/18/romanian-electoral-system-explained/ ) . 
  he 's right when he says that the `` national states do not correspond well to cultural spheres in europe '' . 
  corsica is n't culturally french . 
  in fact , its native language is more italian than the languages spoken in most italian provinces . 
  corsican is a tuscan language , very similar to the language on which the standard italian language has been built . 
  it feels basically like standard italian with a heavy accent . 
  in southern italy , knowledge of standard italian is n't enough to understand the local languages . 
  apparently it 's just two pakistani chemistry students who had some communication with the al qaeda . 
  have you ever been to moldova or have you ever spoken with any moldovans ? 
  they 're not better or worse than us .
