  i think that you can find plenty of rednecks and hillbillies in romania , too . 
  same here in romania ; the `` legionari '' ( members of the fascist iron guard ) became `` communists '' after wwii and they built the infamous securitate and ceau\u0219escu 's nationalist policies . 
  the friendly grammar fascist, 
  in romania , we say that the only two neighbours with which we never had a war are serbia and the black sea . 
  bavaria had both communists and nazis . 
  the bavarian communists declared their communist state , but nazi freikorps quelled the revolution and executed thousands of communists . 
  the americans did their best in the denazification program and they ended up religious conservatives . 
  for some countries , yes . 
  bulgarians , for instance , have less `` slavic '' genes than the romanians . 
  ( where slavic genes are defined by the genes of the polish/western russians ), 
  a bit more about the old names of romanian neighbours : * nem\u021bi -- germans ; occasionally , the name of the city or region used ; for instance lipscani < lipska ( the slavic name of leipzig ) . 
  * \u021aarigr\u0103deni -- byzantines , people from \u021aarigrad ( constantinople ) , from slavic \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0300\u0434\u044a * fr\u00e2nci -- western romance people ( italians , french , etc ) * s\u00e2rbi -- south slavs ( including bulgarians ) ; many bulgarian immigrants called themselves `` serbians '' so they would n't be expelled back to the ottoman empire south of the danube . 
  * arva\u021bi -- croats * le\u0219i -- poles ( singular `` leah '' ) * arn\u0103u\u021bi -- albanians * t\u0103u\u021bi -- slovaks * rusnaci -- ruthenians ; ukrainians * muscali -- russians / muscovites, 
  an andorran friend said that they really love the catalans and that they are willing to help them in their war of independence against spain . 
  i 'm sure that the huge andorran army ( it has just one 12 men `` ceremonial unit '' ) would tip the balance toward the catalan side . 
  we always had a love-hate relationship with the russians ... after the 1878 war against the ottomans , they took southern bessarabia ( now part of ukraine ) and gave us dobruja . 
  we protested because we did n't want it . 
  in retrospect , that seems like a good deal . 
  are you sure that would be a good idea ? 
  the right-wing won every time in bavaria since 1946 and that might affect the politics of the whole germany . 
  but then , maybe national unity is more important than politics . 
  good luck in your quest !, 
   some historicians says poles are also genetically close to hungarians ( but that 's strange , our languages could n't be more different ) . 
  the hungarians assimilated the people they found in pannonia , which is why genetically they 're closer to their neighbours than to the other finno-ugric people . 
  it 's interesting that the most common family names in hungary include : * t\u00f3th ( slovak ) 2.1 % of all hungarians have this name * horv\u00e1th ( croat ) 2.0 % * n\u00e9meth ( german ) 0.9 % * ol\u00e1h ( romanian ) 0.4 % * r\u00e1cz ( serb ) 0.4 %, 
  as a romanian , our brothers are obviously the moldovans . 
  our cousins are the italians and spaniards . 
  we also have some special relationships with some neighbours : * bulgaria , we share too much with them ( culture , traditions , etc ) that we never get along . 
  * hungary , our `` arch-enemy '' , we share more with them than we want to admit * serbia , we consider them our closest friends * poland , it 's like that kind friend you really like , but you never get to see him as often as you 'd like ; as a random thing , a great-grandfather of mine hosted a polish refugee during wwii . 
  job satisfaction and prestige . 
  intellectual jobs give more satisfaction than repetitive hard physical work and they have a higher prestige . 
  in communist romania , a miner would get a bigger wage than the average engineer , who would get a wage only slightly ( maybe 20 % ) higher than the average . 
  did everyone want to be a miner ? 
  hell no , they had problems finding people to do that . 
  did any parent wanted his son to be a miner ? 
  no , of course not , they wanted them to be doctors , engineers , teachers , scientists , etc. 
  then why was n't everyone following higher education ? 
  because while all education was free , the number of places was limited through entrance exams and only the best in those exams could study . 
  czechoslovakia was far richer than romania in 1920 , it was far richer during the communist era and it 's richer now . 
  poland has been better run during the last 20 years , but the differences have been older than that . 
  your economy may have sucked during the 1980s , but it was still far better than what we had during the 1980s when ceau\u0219escu attempted his [ austerity policy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_austerity_policy_in_romania ) . 
  there are differences in wages , but the prices are proportional to them , so those big paris salaries wo n't allow you to go much further in purchasing power . 
  ( just try to buy/rent real estates in paris ... ), 
  there are huge differences in purchasing power between social classes and between regions . 
  it 's not unusual for a programmer/engineer in bucharest to get more than 10 times the minimum wage . 
  on the other hand , in some parts of the country , more than half the jobs are paid the minimum wage . 
  the baltic countries are small ( my city , bucharest , has a bigger population than the whole estonia ) , so it 's easier to be a tiger and also they 're close to scandinavia , so they get plenty of swedish/finnish investment as well . 
  i ca n't see it happening during my lifetime . 
  i 'm 29 . 
  if romania were to have a gdp/capita growth rate that is 3 % higher than germany 's , we 'd need 55 years to reach its gdp/capita . 
  and this 3 % higher than germany growth is unfeasible : if anything , 1the gap is growing . 
  * 2008 : germany : 2.8 % ; romania : 7.8 % * 2009 : germany : -3.5 % ; romania : -7.2 % * 2010 : germany : 3.6 % ; romania : -2.5 % * 2011 : germany : 3 % ; romania 2.5 % . 
  * 2012 : germany : 0.9 % ; romania : 0.7 % ( estimates ), 
  we had quite a few high-level convictions for corruption during the last year , including former prime minister n\u0103stase ( for embezzlement and illegally funding the electoral campaign with state funds ) and former minister of finance decebal traian reme\u0219 ( for getting bribes -- reme\u0219 became infamous because the bribe included not just money and an audi q7 , but also sausages and p\u0103linc\u0103 ) . 
  dozens more trials of politicians and businessmen are taking place right now ( across the political spectrum , so it 's not political revenge ) . 
  almost every week there 's a new politician/businessman arrested : the latest arestee was last week , the owner of a local airline , who [ embezzled ] ( http://www.iol.co.za/business/international/romanian-airline-boss-arrested-1.1434976 ) some money that was supposed to be used for building a highway . 
  also the current government canceled quite a few contracts through which the romanian state was scammed . 
  for instance , the contracts with the `` smart guys '' in the energy sector , who bought electricity from the state-owned hydro plants for less than half the market price and they sold it on at market prices . 
  of course , there 's still a lot of corruption ( for instance , it 's a fair bet that 80 % of the ministers get bribes , kickbacks or preferential contracts ) , but it 's gradually getting better than before . 
  just the basques . 
  i do n't know much about the baltic pre-history , but at least in the areas where the indo-europeans settled in europe there were many and diverse `` pre-indo-european '' people : * in the balkans , the greeks called those people `` pelasgians '' and there is quite a lot of vocabulary in ancient greek borrowed from them , much of it related to the sea ( the word `` thalassa '' itself is of rather clear non-greek origin ) . 
  * the germanic and celtic languages have a lot of words of likely pre-ie origin ( including many seafaring words , the indo-europeans were inland people without any knowledge related to this ) * the etruscans in italy had a very developed civilization and the roman culture was based on it . 
  also , `` armenia '' used to be a lot bigger than what is now armenia . 
  [ a lot of the mediterranean coast ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:anatolia1200.png ) that now belongs to turkey ( the eastern part ) used to belong to the armenians . 
  it seems so : * mure\u0219 -- 23035 romani speakers * bucharest -- 3525 romani speakers, 
  well , in the south , there are more gypsies in the cities and therefore , more visible , hence the stereotype . 
  in transylvania , there a lot of roma in the rural areas . 
  a rural vs. urban gypsies by county map would be interesting as well . 
  i 've seen roma-speaking blond gypsies in bra\u0219ov . 
   anyway , in bucharest , i almost never see any roma speakers and if i see , they are typically gabors from transylvania . 
  it seems that the `` free '' gypsies of transylvania preserved more their language than those in the south . 
  `` rob '' ( < slavic \u0440\u043e\u0431 ) is better translated as `` slave '' than serf . 
  in romanian , `` serf '' is '' \u0219erb '' ( < latin servus ) or `` iobag '' ( < hungarian jobb\u00e1gy ), 
   what 's interesting is that i 've seen more \u201e blonde '' romas in transylvania ( where there was no slavery ) there was slavery in some parts of transylvania , mostly in areas that used to be fiefs or under the influence of wallachia ( bra\u0219ov , bran , f\u0103g\u0103ra\u015f ) or moldavia ( bistri\u021ba ) . 
  also , there are more blond romas in transylvania because there are overall more blond people in the general population . 
  what else do we know about them : * they came from northwestern india or pakistan , near the border * the group formed around 250 bc ( when it started to diverge genetically from the rest of the groups of the area ) * they left that area around 500-1000 ad . 
  * when they left they were a small group ( under a thousand people ) * initially , they were hindu ( based on words such as trushul = cross in romany , derived from trishul , shiva 's trident ) * they arrived in the balkans in the 1200s-1300s , where they were enslaved ; some were able to flee and spread throughout europe . 
  * the ottoman empire destroyed the balkan institution of roma slavery ( together with the whole pre-existing social order ) , with the exception of romania ( wallachia , moldavia ) , which were just vasals/tributary countries , not full ottoman provinces * in romania , the [ slavery of the roma people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) was outlawed only in the 1850s by the romanian boyars who had studied in france and came with the ideas of the enlightenment . 
  * the largest holder of roma slaves was the orthodox church * most roma have a lot of european genes ; in some cases it 's hard to tell the ethnic origin ( there are even blue-eyed blonde gypsies ) ; in the case of the romanian roma , a lot of that admixture also comes from rape : romanian boyars used to keep roma women as sexual slaves . 
  actually , the estonians ( together with their finnish and hungarian cousins ) came to europe from the urals :  in recent times , linguists often place the urheimat , ( german : original homeland ) , of the proto-uralic language in the vicinity of the volga river , west of the urals , close to the urheimat of the indo-european languages , or to the east and southeast of the urals . 
  actually , norway is the biggest producer of farmed salmon , most of which is exported to the eu . 
  well , it was clear that this comment would be downvoted by both nationalists : * the hungarian nationalists , because it says that they 're not going to get transylvania . 
  * the romanian nationalists , because it talks about autonomy for the hungarians who live in transylvania . 
   i could mock romanians for not being anything like the citizens of the former spqr or roman empire , for being slavs with a latin fetish we are a strange bunch , half-way between the slavs and the latins : * we speak a latin language * we have slavic customs * we are half-way between the slavs and the mediterraneans in temperament * genetically we 're more slavic than the bulgarians and more mediterranean than the ukrainians . 
  in territorial disputes , the only thing that matters is the people who inhabit the land : 75 % of the inhabitants of transylvania are romanians . 
  while most hungarians live in mixed areas and cities , there is one area where the hungarian-speaking minority are 90 % of the population : the sz\u00e9kely land . 
  i support more autonomy ( on cultural issues and administration ) , but i 'm sure that too much autonomy is not even wished for now : the local authorities get more money from the central budget than the people in the sz\u00e9kely land pay to it , so fiscal autonomy would n't help them . 
  just a bit of etymology of the kissing words in romanian : the basic word for `` to greet '' in latin is `` saluto/salutare '' ( from salus , `` health , safety , prosperity '' ) . 
  the word got inherited in romanian as ** `` s\u0103rut / s\u0103rutare '' ** , but with a changed meaning : it means `` to kiss '' . 
  the word `` salut '' is in fact borrowed from french . 
  the other word for `` to kiss '' is ** `` a pupa '' ** , from latin `` pupa '' , girl . 
  cognates include french poup\u00e9e ( `` puppet '' ) . 
  a `` small kiss '' is ** `` pupic '' ** . 
   according to the census conducted in 1920 , the romanian population was 57,3 % of the population . 
  that 's correct , but that was after 70 years of hungarian policy of assimilation of the romanians . 
  the percentage of the romanian population was higher in 1850 than in 1920 . 
  well , these guys were serbs , who are not afraid to say it . 
  it 's hard to say what the austrians pegidans think . 
   therefore , far-right !, 
  extremists !,
