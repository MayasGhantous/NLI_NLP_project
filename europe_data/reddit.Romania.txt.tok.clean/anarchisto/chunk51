  i suspect the guys in the video who said `` heil hitler '' were at least a bit nazi . 
   were n't they talking about the totality of victims of romania 's communist regime since the end of ww2 ? 
  no , they were definitely talking about a genocide in december 1989 . 
  this was part of a call-to-action against ceau\u0219escu . 
   or maybe they were just repeating the revolutionaries ' charges against ceau\u0219escu ? 
  the revolutionaries ' charges against ceau\u0219escu ( on december 25 ) were based on those earlier reports ( december 17-19 ) from radio free europe . 
   has n't romanian government classified communist penal system 's track record as a genocide recently ? 
  yup , but this is a different thing . 
  also , the hundreds of thousands of deaths were during the 1950s ( the stalinist era ) , not the 1980s . 
  no country wants to be called `` eastern european '' . 
  well , perhaps kazakhstan , because they want to be called `` european '' . 
  zizek is a troll . 
  stalin 's bust and portraits around his house are there to attract attention . 
  using the expression `` genocide denier '' makes it like he refused to admit the evidence for that genocide , like the holocaust deniers . 
  back in 1977 , there was very little information coming out of cambodia and much of what was published was biased , being slanted by the us government for its propaganda . 
  chomsky was skeptical of the genocide and rightly so : the us government used this kind of propaganda many times before and after and they were often wrong . 
  of course that after some real evidence , not hearsay , came to light , he changed his opinion . 
  let me remind you an episode in the history of romania : back in 1989 , at the early stages of the revolution , cia-funded radio free europe spread the false news ( that was then used by newspapers around the world ) that in timi\u0219oara has been a genocide , with 60.000 dead . 
  in reality there were just a few dozen dead and if you were a skeptical `` genocide denier '' , you would have been right . 
  [ employment-population ratios : ages 15 to 64 , 2013 ( oecd ) ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=lfs_sexage_i_r ) * iceland : 81 % * norway : 75 % * china : 75 % * sweden : 74 % * germany : 73 % * uk : 71 % * russia : 69 % * us : 67 % * france : 64 % * italy : 56 % * spain : 55 % * greece : 49 % * turkey : 49 %, 
  when complaining about one 's own country , you ca n't be worse than the italians . 
  the unemployment rate is meaningless . 
  sweden has 7,8 % unemployment , but 70 % employment-to-population ratio . 
  romania has 6,5 % unemployment , but 50 % employment-to-population ratio . 
  the one made by the economist . 
  bp is still a british company ( headquartered in london ) , it 's just that it 's owned by american investors . 
  the same is valid for other countries as well . 
  for instance , romania 's rompetrol is owned by kazakhstan . 
  the french disease ? 
  actually , they 're giving it away for free . 
  they fund the [ norway grants ] ( http://eeagrants.org/who-we-are/norway-grants ) , which want to make eastern european countries more like scandinavia . 
  of course , i do n't know whether giving money to ngos to militate for things like `` social justice '' and fight against racism and domestic violence works , but it 's nice they try . 
  that 's because it 's not correct . 
  belarus is definitely much less democratic than russia on everything , from the fairness of elections to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly/protest ( in belarus , they just banned all protests ) . 
  you can see this in all the other `` democracy/freedom '' rankings . 
  for instance , the freedom in the world made by freedom house ( which also has an ideological back , being close to the us government establishment ) gave worse ratings for belarus for both political rights and civil liberties . 
  also , the reporters sans fronti\u00e8res says that in belarus the press is less free than in russia . 
  my great-grandfather fought on the eastern front on the axis ; he was decorated after , as a sentry , he heard movement and began shooting the machine gun towards that direction ( waking everyone up in the process ) , foiling a sneak night attack of the soviets . 
  he was wounded and was honorably dismissed . 
  if he had n't been wounded then , he would have most likely died in battle of stalingrad . 
  anyway , as a veteran , he was given a free pass for railroads . 
  he spent the next year ( romania was still in war ) travelling around the country doing odd jobs . 
  there are speed cameras on dn1 . 
  particularly on the prahova valley there are lots of them . 
  we need the others as side-kicks : tito would be the typical laid-back balkan guy , drinking raki , listening to turbo-folk and getting all the ladies . 
  ( both hitler and stalin envying him ) trotsky would have an unhealthy attraction towards ice-picks . 
  ( recurring joke about his relationship with stalin ) freud would unsuccessfully try to use his psychoanalysis skills to attract ladies , but he always gets a freudian slip . 
  it 's illegal , but i guess no one is reporting this to the authorities and the authorities do n't care to start an investigation on their own . 
  i have a friend who is a prosecutor in constan\u021ba , romania and she said she had to deal with a few cases with turkish-speaking roma related to underage brides , rapes , kidnappings and so on . 
   in 2012 and 2013 , interest in the eci was high . 
  over 46 ecis were submitted to the commission , but only 26 were registered , three succeeded , and none led to any meaningful action . 
  consequently , in 2014 , the eci 's use collapsed . 
  only three ecis are now active . 
  of course no one cares about them anymore , because it works like this : a million europeans sign a petition , the commission then says `` no , we do n't like this '' and everything continues as if nothing happened . 
  that 's a great idea for a sit-com : hitler , trotsky , tito , freud and stalin sharing a flat in vienna . 
  sometimes abandoned villages got repopulated and they kept their name . 
  - ishte means `` place of '' , so t\u00e2rg = market , - i\u0219te = place , so t\u00e2rgovi\u0219te is `` marketplace '' . 
  same for romanian sili\u0219te = selo ( village ) + - i\u0219te ( place ) = the place where once was a village . 
  in some languages , like czech , it 's still used to create neologisms . 
  for instance , parkovi\u0161t\u011b = parking lot . 
  yes , but in the case of romanian and albanian , albanian borrowed the words from balkan latin ( the ancestor of romanian ) . 
  in romanian , green is `` verde '' . 
  in albanian , `` verdh\u00eb '' is yellow . 
  in romanian , yellow is `` galben '' . 
  in albanian , `` gjelb\u00ebr '' is green . 
  it seems that albanians mixed up green with yellow . 
  yeah , but it will be russian written with chinese characters . 
   tl ; dr : wat denmark has lower life expectancy than western europe and higher than eastern europe . 
  diesel pollution is far more harmful than gasoline pollution . 
  the number of additional deaths due to fine particles exhausted by the additional diesel cars can be calculated . 
  they used to be best buddies with austria , back in the age of the empire . 
   unemployment is high youth unemployment ( july 2015 , [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics ) ) : * croatia : 43.1 % * germany : 7.0 % when you have such a high youth unemployment , there 's literally no chance to find a job , especially if you 're not a local and you 're just starting to learn the language . 
  which is around 2.5 $ per hour gross or 1.75 $ after taxes . 
  yes , the romanian internet laughed for a couple of months over that . 
  the patriarch said it 's a `` sanctification rod '' , not a paint roller . 
  but the czechs did n't . 
  i wonder why this kind of things happens only in eastern europe . 
  it 's not just because of the religion , the poles are catholics . 
  there are 2.7 million germans having at least one turkish parent . 
  2.68 children/woman in 2014 ( [ cia factbook ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html ) ) , but that 's the total lifetime fertility . 
  a more fair estimation would be that only part are married and an average of 2 children/married woman . 
  1m refugees = ( 250k females and children + 750k males ) + another 350k females ( wives of the males ) + 700k children so in all , there 'd be another million of spouses and children . 
  * utca < ulica ( street ) * palinka ( alcoholic drink ) < palit ' ( to burn ) * paprika < paprika < papar ( black pepper ) * puszta ( the plains of hungary ) < pust\u044a ( barren ) * szalonna < slanina ( lard ), 
  i do n't know how poles , romanians , bulgarians , lithuanians , pakistanis , indians , jamaicans , bangladeshi , nigerians , arabs and chinese can be bundled up together to be considered a majority . 
   his opinions of foreign policy he is one of the founders of the stop the war coalition which wanted to prevent the afghanistan and iraq wars . 
  people of britain would never elect someone who does n't like invading other countries , right ? 
   could this be the beginning of the fragmentation of spain ? 
  i do n't think that outside of the basque country , there are any other serious independence movements . 
  1/3 do n't have running water ... 
  you 're exaggerating the number of people without access to education . 
  unicef says [ there are 59 million children of school age who are being denied their right to education ] ( http://www.unicef.org/education/bege_61657.html ) . 
  nowadays , almost all the world has access to education . 
  not just the billion in europe and america , but china , india , south america and almost all asia . 
  there are some problems in africa , but even there , in most countries things are improving . 
  around half of the asylum seekers come from refugee camps in turkey or other countries . 
  you could argue they are safe , but they and their children are turning into a `` lost generation '' . 
  in the refugee camps they have little access to education ( there are some volunteers and ngos trying their best , but that 's definitely far from being enough -- most kids simply do n't go to school ) and more important , no hope . 
  when you wait for years for a war to end and you see that not only the war does n't end , but it escaladates , you lose all hope in a normal life in your home country . 
  the men are the ones that had the courage to try the dangerous journey and try to find a country which would allow them to settle and then bring their children and wife safely and legally . 
  safe , but without any perspectives .
