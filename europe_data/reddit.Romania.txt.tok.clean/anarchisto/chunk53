  the cause for the greek bankruptcy are not those people who now suffer , but the oligarchy who got all kinds of special tax deals from the state . 
  i 'm talking about the billionaires who made their fortunes in the shipping industry ( which was , as a whole , tax-exempt ) , about the corrupt construction company owners who bribed government ministers for lucrative contracts , etc. 
  leftovers from the yugoslav wars . 
  from what i heard , 60 % are young males , 40 % are women and young children . 
  the reason is that it 's a very risky trip , so many women are staying behind in the refugee camps in turkey or other countries . 
  they 've been saying this for a long time , but netflix and spotify are still not available in romania , while they are available in western europe . 
  it 's as if they do n't want to take my money . 
  oh , well , at least the pirate bay is available here . 
   no , for working illegally . 
  even if they 're working illegally , they 're still trying to feed their families . 
  there are ukrainians , albanians , etc. 
  living illegally in the uk . 
  for instance , eritrea ( which is one the biggest source of african `` economic '' migrants ) is one of the most repressive countries in the world . 
  it is the only country in the world that has a ** less free press than north korea ** . 
  ( according to reporters sans fronti\u00e8res ), 
   vietnam is a fast growing economy of 90 billion inhabitants that 's a big population . 
  in eastern europe , there are plenty of barren villages ( most of them in isolated places ) where all the inhabitants left to work in western europe . 
  a failed state can arise in a country with historical context . 
  if the current outmigration of millions of working-age people continues , it will become a failed state . 
  that 's poverty . 
  you could argue the same thing about other eastern european countries . 
  millions of romanians left the country the last few years to work in the west . 
  does that mean that the `` romanian project '' is dead ? 
  they only prop it up to prevent it fall more than proportional to the price of oil . 
  they could let the market take over , but that would make things worse . 
  well , it 's an attempt at damage control . 
  it 's not a great solution , but the alternatives are even worse . 
  this is the intentional policy implemented by the central bank of russia : to keep rouble proportional to the price of oil . 
  so do the greeks , just that they call it [ greek delight ] ( http://mastic.gr/contents/media/loykoumisf150mastic.jpg ) . 
  most of the rented apartments . 
  but a large percentage of people live in the apartments they own . 
  it already is the landlord . 
  no one is `` investing '' in stockholm real estate , but plenty of people do buy apartments to live in them , which is why they 're quite expensive . 
  well , some stores do save money by removing cashiers ( self-checkout ) . 
  the romanian healthcare system is fucked up . 
  the wages from the state are pretty worthless , but many mds working for the state get dozens of times more than that in informal `` bribes '' from patients . 
  not enough . 
  thousands of mds already left romania to work in western europe ( particularly france and germany ) . 
  if they do n't do something quick , the national healthcare system will have a serious crisis . 
  the average wage for healthcare employees ( mds , nurses and auxiliary staff ) is 340 $ / month . 
  a benefits-based system takes a lot of resources to administrate , to check for fraud , etc. , so these resources can be used in other parts of the economy , so theoretically , it will lead to a higher standard living . 
  you do realize that in stockholm there is a free market for buying apartments and , yet , there is no apropriate supply for this , either ? 
   and new appartement are beeing build in uppsala at least . 
  the same is valid for stockholm : they 're building new apartments everywhere around the city . 
  so the solution is to make fewer people want to move to stockholm ? 
  this is leading to a lower economic growth and an even more segregated city , between the rich and the poor . 
  stockholm is currently overwhelmingly middle class , unlike other big european cities . 
  the only solution to a housing shortage is to build more housing and you ca n't do it in the historic center , so you build in the outskirts . 
  do you have other solution ? 
  the apartments are very expensive to buy in stockholm , even though there is no `` buy-to-let '' market . 
  it 's a half-assed attempt at a planned economy . 
  if the government was actually building new neighbourhoods around stockholm , the issue would not exist . 
  the rent control does not work when you have a constant number of apartments and a rising population ( due to internal and international migration ) . 
  [ stockholm county had a population of 1.2 million in the 1960s and now it has 2.1 million . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sv/timeline/3d50cfb2443c3897b9438528e16d031e.png ) the number of state-owned apartments that are rented out on the market has simply not followed the same trend . 
   from client states protected by the superpower and following its command , we would become equals de gaulle , hell yeah !, 
   yet that 's not where most asylumseekers come from . 
  amazing , is n't it ? 
  [ here 's the data for asylum seekers for 2014 from eurostat  ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d5/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) 1 . 
  eritrea - 5.9 % 5 . 
  serbia - 4.9 % 6 . 
  iraq - 3.4 % the west has been militarily involved in all of them since 1990 . 
  if during the communist era , germany would sentence to prison the poles fleeing persecution in their country , would you agree with that decision ? 
  would you compare the freedom-yearning poles with thieves ? 
  the eritreans who flee their country are in a similar situation : [ eritrea is the only country in the world to have ** less ** press freedom than north korea ] ( https://index.rsf.org/ ), 
   no matter how you look at it , immigration is n't going to end global poverty . 
  it 's ok for the millions of poverty-stricken eastern europeans to leave for western europe , but it 's not ok for other people ? 
   there are almost 6 bilion people in the world who live on $ 10 a day or less . 
  that includes probably 80-90 % of romanians . 
   the people who come here are of vastly different cultures so were the hungarians when they came to europe . 
  i 'd say they assimilated quite well . 
    they 're generally uneducated that can be solved . 
  we can try to make sure that their children are educated . 
   they 're as needy as children when it comes to the governmental support they need . 
  they 're younger than the europeans , so they need less governmental support than the average european . 
  there 's plenty of work : europe has a serious lack of housing and of infrastructure and solving this problem would require huge amounts of less skilled labor . 
   you have to fight the cause , not the symptoms . 
  yes , and the cause is imperialism . 
  we should n't try to arm one group or another in their own country . 
  we invaded iraq , we invaded afghanistan , we bombed libya , we supported the rebels in syria , we fought in mali ( and countless other places in `` francafrique '' ) , we supplied arms to countless armed groups . 
   only going to degenerate our own nations in the long run indeed . 
  the brown subhumans are ruining our aryan race . 
   `` decarbonization is completely not in our interest . '' of course it 's not : poland has the 10th largest known coal deposits . 
  but why ca n't we decide that some things are in the interest of the humanity as a whole ? 
   yeah , but that 's also a soldier a soldier with diplomatic immunity is officially a diplomat . 
  our minimum wage is 200 $ / month , totally inadequate for a decent life , so migrants do n't want to come here in the first place . 
   a government ca n't and will not raise wages the government can give more power to the unions and then the unions can force a wage raise . 
  also , increasing the minimum wage increases all the other wages in the country . 
  of course : they just fake mental illnesses caused by years of living on the street . 
  they probably spent a lot of time on wikipedia to read about the mental illnesses they chose . 
   to a large extent it 's these people lifestyld choice of course it 's a lifestyle choice . 
  i bet many of them have mansions and private jets but prefer to live in the rain and cold . 
   being homeless is one thing but fencing off a part of a public square in the middle of a city is another thing where should they live , then ? 
  on other people 's private property ? 
  the same thing would happen . 
  on a public square in the outskirts of the city ? 
  is n't it the same thing as on the street in the middle of the city ? 
  they are not patriotic enough !, 
  at least on the romanian slice of the internet , people who are not 100 % pro-american and 100 % anti-russian are called `` russian trolls '' . 
  i 've been called a russian troll countless times ( i oppose foreign troops in romania , regardless of origin ) and i 'm pretty sure i 'm a romanian citizen who does n't even speak russian .
