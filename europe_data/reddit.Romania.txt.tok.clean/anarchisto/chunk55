  they 're not banning condoms , they 're banning condom imports . 
  fucking with [ soviet condoms ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/100/275723171_9bb9a1e0ac.jpg ) is the patriotic way . 
   they ca n't travel by plane ( since planes are ` evil western ' boeings and airbuses ) what about the sukhoi superjet 100 ? 
  the problem is not the infrastructure inherited from the communist times , it 's the lack of investment for the last 20 years . 
  in bucharest , the grid was privatized and the italian company which bought it was required to do investments . 
  it did n't do them , leading to worse blackouts than we had a decade ago . 
  the state chose to ignore that they breached the privatization contract . 
  the vietnamese are as `` slave '' as were the japanese two generations ago and the koreans one generation ago . 
  yes , they 're still poor , but they 're developing quite fast . 
  their government spends huge amounts on education and it seems to be working : [ their children are ahead of almost all eu countries ' children in pisa tests ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33047924 ) showing they have great potential of growth in the future as well . 
  the problem about ttip is not the free trade agreement itself . 
  if it included only that , it would be ok . 
  the eu signed plenty of other free trade agreements . 
  the controversial parts are about : * investor-state disputes outside the justice system . 
  * pesticides that would have to become legal in europe . 
  * allowing hormone-laced meat in the eu market * pharmaceutical patents reform that would make eu healthcare systems pay more for drugs protected by the patents * copyright enforcement rules ( see acta and all that ) the vietnam trade agreement does n't change the rules regarding consumer protection in the eu . 
  if you import vietnamese goods to the eu , they have to surpass the eu standards , it does n't matter if they are ok according to vietnamese law . 
  they came from punjab , the border region split between india and pakistan . 
  the gdp of moldova is around $ 8 billion . 
  the capital ( total wealth ) is typically worth 5-10x the production/gdp , but moldova has underutilized capital ( it exists , but it does n't produce much ) , so it 's probably towards the higher end of the scale . 
  i guess the whole moldova is probably worth $ 80 billion / 70 billion $ . 
  the gdp would fall more than 1.75 % because the car factory employees buy stuff , leading to a downward spiral . 
  i got one from the son of gaddafi !, 
  prague is a great city , why would anyone hate it ? 
  that 's perfect . 
  we should n't go to war unless we 're invaded . 
   for france , which does n't . 
  a strong eu army means a larger degree of independence from the us . 
  gaullism ( with its skepticism over us intentions in europe ) is still strong in france . 
  an army with italian food can defeat anyone !, 
  those people moved to spain to work in the booming construction sector and had children there . 
  if the educated economists could n't the fortell the crisis , how could a plumber ? 
  yeah . 
  people do whatever they can to have a job and feed their family . 
  it 's not easy , especially in this economy . 
  it 's a funny thing : romanians emigrated to spain and italy and they brought their kids and family . 
  then the crisis struck and they became unemployed . 
  now many of these romanians kept their family in spain , but they went as migrant workers to britain or germany . 
  the saudis tried to bring their wahhabi extremism to the balkan muslims ( bosniaks , albanians , etc. 
  ) , but apparently , they were not very successful because they were regularly scammed . 
  saudis would try to recruit people for spreading extremism , but after they were given some money to invest in a nice extremist mosque , they would disappear with it . 
  maybe it said `` 200 cluster bombs '' and one had already been taken out . 
  maybe krnjavi is part of a kebab removal team . 
  [ according to the eu , only 35 % of latvians and 30 % of lithuanians are poor . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/statistics-illustrated ) the rest have potato . 
  such is life . 
  it does n't matter how much the latvians spend . 
  latvia , a country having less than 2 million people can not possibly stop an enemy 100 times bigger . 
  the europeans need to be united because , if we are united , then we are too big for any external enemy . 
   so is the increased spending going to accomplish something that the current level of spending ca n't ? 
  yes . 
  they will be able to resist a russian invasion for ** 30 ** minutes rather than the current 20 minutes . 
  * ** m10 ** : a middle-aged prosecutor and 9 other people no one knows . 
  romania : * ** social-democrats ** : a mafia-like organization pretending to be a center-left party , but in practice they 're just a bunch of corrupt oligarchs . 
  * ** national-liberals ** : a mafia-like organization pretending to be a center-right party , but in practice they 're just a bunch of corrupt oligarchs . 
  less competent in election fraud than the social-democrats , which is why they 're in opposition . 
  * ** democratic magyar union ** : a mafia-like organization pretending to be a hungarian ethnic party , but in practice they 're just a bunch of corrupt magyar oligarchs . 
  * ** national union for the progress of romania ** : just like the social-democrats and national-liberals , but they do n't even pretend they have a doctrine , so they just put some buzzwords like `` national interest '' and so on . 
  * ** socialists ** : pensioners who miss the ceau\u0219escu days . 
  also saudi arabia . 
   it 's not exactly next to paris either . 
   32 km is not far . 
  why ? 
  they built it in the place with the most tourists . 
  you 're going to be downvoted because eastern europeans do n't believe that `` gypsies '' are people . 
  br\u00e2nz\u0103 is typically white cheese , ca\u0219caval is yellow/aged cheese . 
  by the time of the civil war , there was already some western involvement . 
  or make a cat bell campaign : to encourage owners to add a bell to their cat 's collar . 
  i am not eligible for the european health insurance card because romania requires that i was insured for the whole last 5 years . 
  if it happened that at one time in the last 5 years i was not insured ( a six-month period 3-4 years ago ) , i 'd have to backpay the insurance dues for that period in order to be eligible . 
  as such , when going abroad , it 's cheaper for me to buy private travel insurance than get the european health insurance card from the romanian government . 
  i thought it 's absurd for the romanian government to put these restrictions and i asked the european commission about this and their response was that it was the romanian government 's choice to choose who is eligible for european health insurance and that what they 're doing is not against european regulations . 
  they do this to avoid costs of medicine abroad : about 16 % of the romanian youth ( aged 18-35 ) are currently not insured and many more have been uninsured at one time in the last 5 years . 
  `` i 'm rich !, 
  rich people do n't get arrested ! '', 
   i hate muslims , bro . 
  so you hate poor muslims , right ? 
  [ a facebook page named `` italian revolution international '' .

  [ dead or olive !, 
  no , they wo n't . 
  they have great strategic location and the us is not willing to risk giving it to russia . 
  they have an economic meltdown , so they need to find scapegoats . 
  communists are as good as any other and they do n't have paramilitary militias like other groups . 
  some figures : * 272 % annual inflation rate ( march 2014 - march 2015 ) * -9 % economic growth ( imf estimate 2015 ) * $ 140 average wage [ link ] ( http://observer.com/2015/07/ukraine-spirals-into-the-abyss-pensioner-suicides-and-open-talk-of-default/ ) * $ 48 minimum wage * $ 43 pensions * government debt [ higher than 100 % of gdp ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2d058776-312b-11e5-8873-775ba7c2ea3d.html ) ( it was 15 % in 2007 , 40 % at the end of 2013 ), 
  he did claim he was just following orders , but almost certainly the orders did not include the brutality , even though his superiors did turn a blind eye to such abuses . 
  brutality was a way to show the superiors how dedicated to the cause he was . 
  many romanians in power thought this way and that 's why in romania there was far more brutality than in any other eastern european country ( perhaps excluding stalin 's ussr ) . 
  this happened during the 1950s and 1960s . 
  during ceau\u0219escu , dedication to the leadership was shown through [ sycophancy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_ceau\u0219escu%27s_cult_of_personality ) . 
   yes a hundred years ago . 
  [ last anti-gypsy pogrom was in 1993 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h\u0103d\u0103reni_riots ) . 
  that led to pogroms before and it can happen again . 
  do you really think what we need is more `` kill all gypsies ! '', 
  politicians ? 
   because we want to encourage land owning what 's the point in encouraging owning the land in order to keep it barren ? 
  we want to encourage using the land for something productive . 
  we have the lowest property tax in the eu . 
  our annual real estate tax is typically 0.01 % - 0.1 % of the value , whereas in western europe , it is often 1 % -2 % . 
  ** free school meals for all children ** ( nordic countries like sweden , finland and estonia already have it ) romania has a serious issue with : * child poverty ( almost half the children live in poverty ) and , related to it , inadequate food intake and child malnutrition * very high school dropout rates , particularly in rural areas and also for the roma minority .
