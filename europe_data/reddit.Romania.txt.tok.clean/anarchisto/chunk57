  exactly . 
  all the restaurants where i eat lunch kept their prices . 
   i trust mafia-run european olive oil italian-branded olive oil is typically made in spain and it 's mixed with various other oils , some not made out of olives . 
   ours was just over 8 % of gdp - not over 18 % of gdp your figures are wrong . 
  uk 's deficit was not 8 % , but [ 11.6 % in 2009 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8636701.stm ) . 
  also , greece 's deficit was not 18 % , but [ 15.4 % in 2009 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-11755320 ), 
  the deficit of 18 % of gdp was a result of the crisis and the increasing cost of borrowing . 
  let me remind you that at the same time , britain had a similar budget deficit because it used the money to bail out banks . 
  do you consider healthcare , education and pensions `` tumorous overgrowth '' ? 
   i would recommand cuba yeah : last chance before hordes of american tourists invade it . 
   private police and private justice courts would me a lot more efficient i can imagine . 
  just killing people is a lot more cost-efficient than housing them in prisons . 
  and without any state supervision , killing or putting them in slavery would not be uncommon . 
   any non-voluntary transaction is theft . 
  ... and there will be a lot of theft in your right-wing libertarian utopia . 
  the big corporations and the rich would have their own private armies , but the regular people without their own army would have to defend themselves as they could against the well-armed roaming gangs . 
  and there will be plenty of roaming gangs . 
  without any form of welfare , unemployed people will have to steal to survive . 
  it 's robbing other people or dying of hunger . 
  the fact that ak-47s will be available at your local supermarket will help . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that your local armed militia wo n't stand a chance against those professional gangs who do that for a living . 
  you can be [ a clown ] ( http://res.cloudinary.com/sagacity/image/upload/c_limit,w_993/0315-ice-house-jon-gnarr-reykjavik-iceland-mayor-4_dxn9fv.jpg ) and still be a great politician . 
  italy is too big to fail . 
  greece is not . 
  last time the whole italian political system crumbled under the weight of its corruption it was replaced by berlusconi . 
   moscowicz 's moscovici , it 's the romanian spelling of the name ( his father was born in romania ) . 
   it 's quite stable it 's not stable , it 's growing : * 2008 : 103 % * 2009 : 106 % * 2010 : 116 % * 2011 : 119 % * 2012 : 116 % * 2013 : 123 % * 2014 : 128 % * 2015 : 132 % [ source : eurostat ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/government-debt-to-gdp ) it grew by 29 % of the gdp during the last 7 years . 
  that 's impressive . 
  but italy is a special case : unlike greece , it is too big to fail . 
   there are laws and regulations which neither germany nor greece can change . 
  there are laws and regulations which germany wrote ( the ecb rulebook is based on the rules of the deutsche bundesbank ) . 
  these rules are very different from the ones of other countries such as france and italy . 
  greece could n't contribute to them because it joined the zone after they were already written . 
  that sounds like : `` horse-based transportation is not dead . 
  i still own a horse . '', 
  back in the 1970s , every manager had his/her own secretary in order to schedule meetings , to type letters and handle correspondence , to book up transportation , etc. 
  now there 's no such thing , at least for anyone but the top management in large corporations . 
  you type your own emails , you schedule meetings in outlook , you book up your own plane tickets online , etc. 
  there are far fewer office administrators than there were secretaries . 
  well , i meant predicting world history , the impact of technology or economics , not hard science predictions . 
  predicting the future is not a science . 
  universal healthcare systems , 8-hour working day , universal suffrage were ideas that were supported by the communists back in the 19th century . 
  just because they support an idea does n't make it wrong . 
  just because a prediction was false in the past , it does n't mean it will continue to be false . 
   people ca n't automate everything just give it enough time . 
  30 years ago , the most common job for women was `` secretary '' . 
  now secretaries are all but extinct . 
  the same will happen to taxi and lorry drivers in 10 years and many other jobs . 
  some economists argued that more than half of the workforce is vulnerable to automation within the next two decades . 
   automation means freeing up the available workforce to provide their services elsewhere . 
  ... and yet , in almost all countries , unemployment is higher than it was 10 or 20 years ago . 
  also , no , it 's not because the jobs are moving to china , because [ china 's workforce is shrinking ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/101349829 ) . 
  * italy : bipbipbipbipbip . . bip . . bip . . bip . . bip . . bip . 
  * romania : ... ... ... ... bip ... . . bip ... . bip ... * bulgaria : ... ... ... * crickets * ... ... ... bip ... 
  that 's why they were so confident the banks will open on tuesday . 
   greece is one of the most corrupt countries in europe , top 3 even in the eu , maybe . 
  romania and bulgaria are more corrupt , italy is probably equally corrupt . 
  ( mafia makes sure it stays this way ) in europe , it 's hard to reach the level of corruption of moldova , ukraine , belarus or even russia . 
  you can photograph , it 's just illegal to publish the photograph you took . 
   nobody cares wikipedia cares . 
  if you upload a photo of a copyrighted building , it will be deleted . 
  the eiffel tower 's copyright expired already , but its lighting system during the night is still copyrighted , so it 's ok to publish a photo of the tower during the day , but not during the night . 
  [ the seikilos epitaph includes the musical notation and lyrics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seikilos_epitaph ) . 
  yup , we devalued the romanian leu when the crisis struck us . 
  * july 2007 : 1 $ = 3,12 lei * january 2009 : 1 $ = 4,32 lei ( +38 % ), 
  `` yeah , but are you a catholic buddhist or a protestant buddhist ? '', 
  ukrassia or ruskraine ? 
  zeus is angry this weekend . 
  due to capital controls , it does n't work to send money to buy bitcoin , so it 's exactly the same as paypal . 
   more than a little bit of us intervention here exactly . 
  a greece straying from the european union countries would be embraced by russia and china and that 's against us geostrategic interests . 
   bulgaria and romania would be against because the greeks get payed a higher wage actually , the opinions are more mixed than expected . 
  i 'd guess everyone is making their own narative based on their own ideology . 
  * right-wingers / neoliberals say the greeks are lazy and living on other people 's money and , as such , deserve the austerity and misery . 
  ( for instance , lucian m\u00eendru\u021b\u0103 , moise guran ) * left-wingers say the greeks are collectively punished and this is destroying the solidarity within the eu . 
  ( vasile ernu , claudiu cr\u0103ciun ) * nationalists are pro-greece , seeing them as oppressed by imperialist germany . 
  * religious people are usually supporting their orthodox brothers against decadent west . 
  ( iulian capsali ) * ... and then some people ( regardless of ideology ) just dislike and distrust the banks and support everyone who fights back . 
  the data is wrong , at least for romania . 
  in the source it says 8969 ron/month , which is 747 ron/month or 167 $ / month . 
  we 're better than bulgaria and that 's the only thing that matters . 
  the wikipedia page has history and i can see how the text evolved . 
  also , the initial version was translated from the equivalent in english years ago . 
  the romanian social-democratic party copied on their website the part on social-democratic principles from wikipedia . 
  ( without citing it , of course ), 
   social democratic principles are no longer very electable really ? 
  how come syriza got elected on what were basically 1970s social-democratic ideas ? 
  how come podemos is getting increasingly popular and the candidates it supported in barcelona and madrid won based on the same ideas ? 
  in the us , bernie sanders appears to getting lots of support by praising social-democratic ideas . 
  now we call them `` left-wing radicals '' , but they are rather moderate social-democrats from a few decades ago . 
  the reason is simple : social-democrats have abandoned their principles . 
   when they are n't busy with slavery , genocide and imperialism/colonialism ? 
  actually , the ottoman empire was not worse than any of the other empires of its time . 
  slavery , genocide and imperialism were found in greater quantities in the french empire , the british empire and the russian empire . 
  for most of the time , the life of the people inside the empire was not that bad . 
  the empire guaranteed freedom of religion for christians , muslims and jews , gave wide local autonomies to both regions and ethnic groups and even held some limited ideas of human rights , part of their concept of justice ( which , for instance , led to the abolishment of serfdom in wallachia and moldavia during the 18th century , among the earliest in europe ) . 
  perhaps the empire was more `` humane '' because of its lack of modernity : it had no nationalism and no capitalist ideas , so the minorities were not repressed for national goals or for profit . 
  if you mean `` no rich country has defaulted '' , it 's like saying `` no rich country is poor '' . 
   the first developed country in history to fail to meet a loan payment is not ? 
  there have been hundreds of defaults , it 's not the first one .
