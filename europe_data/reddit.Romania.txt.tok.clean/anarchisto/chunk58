  germany could n't pay their wwi debt and defaulted in 1932 , as they did in 1948 due to the wwii debt , much of which was later forgiven . 
  some communist countries ( such as yugoslavia , poland and bulgaria ) failed to pay in the 1980s , russia in 1998 at the height of their economic crisis , argentina in 2001 following many years of instability .

  now they 'll cry about censorship and an international conspiracy against the family values . 
  however , for the next parliamentary elections , the current `` pro-european '' coalition might lose because of some outrageous cases of corruption . 
  if europe really wants moldova on their side , they should try to convince the pro-eu politicians to steal a bit less . 
  it 's just the chi\u0219in\u0103u mayoral election and this is the incumbent , so it 's not a change of regime . 
  nothing . 
  actually , it 's a good thing to have a plurality of opinions within a party rather than to have a nazi party/communist party of the soviet union-style of conformism or gulag . 
   all i have heard from them is that venezuela did some good things and other bad things that 's like turning `` x thinks nazi germany 's policy of building infrastructure ( autobahns ) during a crisis was a great idea '' into `` x thinks nazi germany is an example to be followed '' . 
  they 're still going to work . 
   podemos puts ~ ~ spain , european ~ ~ * german * project at risk . 
  ftfy, 
   about a topic that will be finally decided 5 days earlier decided by whom ? 
  the imf ? 
  no , that 's not a default and if they pay a week later , it 's still ok according to their rules . 
  the eu ? 
  that 's just petty . 
  if the reforms would start a week later , it 's not a big deal and they know it . 
   opposing any actual possible implementation of any european union they want to reform the european union , not to disband it . 
  they oppose particularly they way the eu imposes neoliberal ideas to the member countries , how there can be no alternative to this economic ideology . 
  there are plenty of left-wingers who do not oppose the idea of a european union , but rather the current implementation of european union . 
   economic growth in greece it was a `` technical '' growth , not real growth . 
  the gdp continued to fall in 2014 ( when measured in euros ) , however the gdp ppp rose a bit because of deflation . 
  due to the high unemployment , the wage costs went down and the businesses lowered the prices in a spiral of lack of purchasing power and high unemployment . 
  this is not a recovery . 
  and , in the long term , china . 
   a 43-year-old man was gored twice by a bull during celebrations in the southwestern town of coria , extremadura on wednesday , despite standing behind a protective fence . 
  * extrema dura * , indeed . 
  this kind of debt can only be repaid by growing the economy and making them a smaller percentage of the gdp and thus easier to repay . 
  they pay income tax , they pay vat , etc. 
  also , they use far fewer services than native brits . 
  they 're young , so they cost less the nhs . 
  they usually have their kids back home in romania , so they do n't use the schools . 
  they usually do n't have a car , so they 're not using up the roads , etc. 
  greek government gets more money in taxes than it spends . 
  however , this surplus is not enough to return the loans given by imf and ecb ( european central bank ) . 
  greece can not borrow money from the market to pay those loans because the market is willing to borrow at huge interest rates ( 10 % ) , so they can only borrow from the imf and ecb ( which give discounted interest rates ) . 
  the imf and ecb requested the greek government to do ever more cuts , even if they do n't need them , which outraged both the greek people and their government . 
  yes , but it did n't hurt enough . 
  the point of austerity is to be a punishment , not a way to solve the crisis . 
   real estate space costs astronomically real estate is more expensive in london than in tokyo . 
   according to tokyo kantei , the average asking price of a 70 sqm ( 753 sq ft ) apartment in greater tokyo in may was 29,980,000 yen [ 216,000 $ = 3000 $ / sq.meter ] [ link ] ( http://japanpropertycentral.com/2015/06/secondhand-apartment-prices-in-may-2015-tokyo-kantei/#more-53286 )    uk house prices hit new record as london average breaks # 500,000 . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/16/house-prices-record-bubble-interest-rates-uk ), 
  i do n't have a positive impression , but i do n't have a negative impression . 
  people are people . 
  i do n't see why high-rise apartment buildings are any worse than the current [ hundreds of thousands of identical semi-detached houses .

   the idea of ending a human life so it 's ok to end a human life if it was due to a rape ? 
  in the village of my grandparents ( southern romania ) , many people left to work in italy and spain , but during the downturn many returned . 
  the last few months they began to go to work in the uk . 
  for instance , a cousin of my mother worked as a plumber during the construction boom in spain , got back here , now he 's in the uk . 
   stress and strain on infrastructure you say this as if it 's not possible to fix it . 
  any problems you have related to the infrastructure can be solved through investment . 
  tokyo has 33 million people in an area that is equal to 3 % of england and their infrastructure is amazing . 
   well that 's terrifying . 
  why ? 
  because britain is becoming less british ? 
   was n't the mayor of reykjavik a former comedian correct . 
  funny guy . 
   created some ridiculous party correct . 
  [ the best party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/best_party ) . 
  ridiculously funny . 
   had no idea how to govern so he spent most of his time pulling political stunts . 
  that 's not true . 
  he did n't have any political experience before , but that 's not needed . 
  some intelligence and common sense is all you need . 
  he claimed to be an `` anarchist '' , but in practice he said he meant by that left-wing/socialist and anti-bureaucratic policies . 
  the people of reykjavik loved j\u00f3n 's policies and he was the most popular mayor the city ever had . 
  he would have easily won reelection , but he did n't want to be a candidate again . 
  then what 's the point of all of this ? 
  americans can sell their crappy chemical aditives-ridden food in europe and we ca n't sell our eggs in the us ? 
  you 're misreading the data . 
  maximum = 102.60 current = 65.20 so overall it lost 44 % of the value . 
  however , these numbers include the premium properties bought by westerners , which are irrelevant for our case . 
  the athens property went down even more . 
   i doubt 70 % of the people there have defaulted on their mortgage a greek got their 20/30 years mortgage a decade ago , just like millions of other europeans . 
  they paid for their apartment/house the market value that was valid then . 
  since then , their house is now worth a quarter of that . 
  they lost their job ( a quarter of greeks are unemployed ) and in the unlikely case they get hired again , they get a wage half of what they used to make . 
  poland has a growing economy . 
  if a pole got a mortgage a decade ago , now it is easier for him/her to pay because their wages are higher than they were . 
  there 's no widespread chronic unemployment as in greece , so it 's easier to find a job if they get laid off . 
   but is that because of institutional discrimination against women , or because women generally prefer other careers ? 
  yes , it 's institutional discrimination within the parties . 
  most parties have three types of local organizations : the main one , the youth wing and the women 's wing . 
  if you join the party as a woman , you go into the women 's wing . 
  basically , the women 's wings do n't matter , they are never asked about policies , they 're not taken seriously . 
  the main organization , the `` men 's wing '' provides almost all candidates ( sometimes , they include some women who are the relatives or mistresses of those men ) . 
  in eastern europe , it 's more than on ideological level . 
  we tended to have : * `` hazing '' from the previous generation of soldiers ( 6 months older ) . 
  this includes physical violence and often borders torture . 
  * harassment and violence from officers and other soldiers ( being gay , shorter or weaker were good reasons for harassment ) * forced work , often at a general 's mansion or land . 
  ( gardening work , construction work , etc. ), 
  * arbitrariness within the daily life in a military unit . 
  the higher ranked people act like gods . 
  * higher ranked people do n't follow the rules . 
  if you complain about that , you get into detention .
