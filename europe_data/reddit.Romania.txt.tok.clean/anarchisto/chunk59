  * corruption and nepotism : some soldiers have obviously better treatment due to bribery or for having relatives in the army . 
  * high suicide rates due to all of the above . 
  luckily , conscription is over in most of eastern europe . 
  it 's still there in russia , though . 
  this is not just the case for some small ruthless entrepreneurs , the big corporations do it , so it is the rule . 
  vodafone romania does it , banks do it , etc. 
  of course , this is part of a bigger problem of not respecting the workers ' rights . 
  a friend of a friend told me about how the company for which she worked ( a big french corporation in oil services ) threatened the workers to fire them if they create a union . 
  i 'm pretty sure the same company would not be able to behave like that back home in france . 
  subtitle : `` i love being a slave for a year '' . 
   a lot better than in other countries * in romania it 's acceptable for the boss to say `` i 'll hire you if you promise you wo n't become pregnant in the next 3 years '' * in romania it 's acceptable for the boss to threaten to fire you if you take more than 3 months of child leave . 
  ( or , as my wife was told , `` i hope you do n't have the nerve to take the full parental leave '' ) * in romania it 's acceptable to fire the newly mother during the first day of work after coming back from parental leave ( even though this is illegal ! ) . 
  i know at least a few cases when this happened , including a friend 's wife who worked for a big bank . 
  ( after some negociations , she got three-months pay on the condition that she would resign rather than being dismissed ) the legislation tends to be ok , but the problem is that the state intervention in a work conflict takes ages and most employees just prefer to go on and try to find something else . 
   complete gender equality is a thing since early communist that 's false . 
  in romania , political representation for women is the worst in europe and one of the worst in the world . 
  for instance , [ men make up 93 % of the senators ] ( http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2262_e.htm ) . 
  if freedom of panorama is removed like the lobbyists want , then it means that all photos of european buildings or public works of art protected by copyright will be deleted from wikipedia . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this will affect tourism in europe far more than they 'll get back in royalties . 
  imagine a wikipedia article about `` the little mermaid '' sculpture in denmark with no photo of it because it 's protected by copyright . 
  [ `` do you have a positive or a negative impression of the following groups ? 
  '' ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/g96awulgzv/eurotrack_minorities_w.pdf ), 
   `` there are only mosquitos and nothing else , '' he said , `` so i think that this idea and this marketing program can bring something new to croatia . 
  bringing new people , bringing money . '', 
  no , not only mosquitos , but a rare undisturbed aquatic ecosystem on the danube . 
   those are opposites when it comes to the politics basically . 
  no ( significant ) correlation . 
  the us is much more religious than europe and that helps : * there are millions of mormons , who have on average 3 children . 
  * there are hundreds of thousands of amish , who have on average 6 children . 
  * many other small religious movements which encourage large families . 
  if you look at the least religious states , they also have the lowest fertility . 
  for instance , vermont and new hampshire , the two least religious states have on average 1.66 children , same low fertility for maine , massachusetts and all the other new england non-religious states . 
  yes , that 's right and this is the right way . 
  the decision to have children must be personal . 
  if everyone who wanted to have children would have them , there 'd be no birth rate problem . 
   this is the cultural level around here ... what has the cultural level to do with the kind of music one listens ? 
  i know some well-educated hipsters who listen to * manele * . 
   i 'm sceptical whether it will actually divert all migrants toward romania/croatia romania and croatia are not ( yet ) part of schengen , so there 's no point . 
  they 'll still have to cross another border to get into the schengen zone . 
  only 20 million people entered the us illegally through that border . 
  if hungary had illegal colonies in serbian territory and then build a wall to protect them , making serbs movement within their own territory impossible , then , yes , it would the same . 
   lower taxes . 
  to the point of almost removing them . 
  i assume that no taxes means no free healthcare , no free education , no unemployment benefits , right ? 
  and if the man becomes unemployed , what happens ? 
  the family gets thrown out in the street ? 
  if a child is sick , they let him/her die ? 
  they stop the children 's education due to lack of money ? 
   this way women will be able to stay at home and have children . 
  what if women * do n't want * to stay at home ? 
  what if they want a career , too , not just kids ? 
   i do not understand why you see lower class families seemingly having more kids it depends on the country . 
  in sweden there are plenty of highly educated people who have three or more children , something that is almost unheard-of in southern or eastern europe . 
  ( i know several swedes who have three kids and not a single romanian ), 
  education generally ends by age 25 . 
  you have 10 more years before the age of 35 , when fertility starts to go down . 
  the problem is that young families ( aged 25-35 ) ca n't afford a house/apartment , they ca n't afford to have a baby , so they postpone this until they advance in their career . 
  this can be solved through : * less wage inequality : young people currently get the short end of the stick related to jobs , especially in southern european countries . 
  * cheaper housing : if you ca n't afford an apartment and you live with your parents ( as many europeans do ) , you wo n't have children * state-subsidized childcare : so the mother can get back to work, 
  99.999 % of bangladeshi must be more stupid than the average swedish janitor , right ? 
  the company involved in the romanian scandal is eads deutschland gmbh , probably a subsidiary of the company . 
  do n't worry , they 're not bribing only you . 
  they 're bribing our politicians as well . 
  a big scandal in romania involves eads . 
   skype - swedish ? 
  what happened to microsoft ? 
  it was bought out by microsoft . 
  exactly . 
  if you know there is a strong welfare system to help you if you fail , you are more likely to risk . 
  those african `` economic migrants '' are mostly from somalia , which has been under a civil war for decades and currently there are battles between al-qaeda militias and the somali government . 
  there are also people from other countries like mali , which is also undergoing a civil war and eritrea , a harsh dictatorship which is the only country in the world to have * less * press freedom than north korea . 
  turkey did not apply the `` austerity '' ideas of imf . 
  the imf did not impose measures some as draconic as in greece . 
  for instance , the minimum wage gradually went up from 150 $ in 2002 to 425 $ today . 
  i doubt they want to do that . 
  they need the imf to be the big bad bully . 
  well , it depends on what you consider solving the debt problems . 
  they do the job they were chartered by their big shareholders ( mainly the us and western european governments ) . 
  their task is not to solve the economic or social problems of any country ( more likely they make these problems bigger ) , but rather to prevent a default that would affect private creditors ( banks , investment funds , large personal fortunes , etc ) from the us and western europe . 
  from the private creditors ' point of view , the imf is doing a great job . 
  from the point of view of the regular people in those countries , they 're destroying their life . 
  finno-ugric came to europe later . 
  [ their original homeland was in what is now russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/lenguas_finougrias.png ) . 
   it has never been spoken in history . 
  [ actually , the spread of basque was far beyond the current province in the middle ages . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/linguistic_map_southwestern_europe.gif ), 
  all people should speak french , because the king of france wants the regular people not to understand the official language , so they can be kept under the feudal rule . 
  at least this was the argument during the french revolution . 
  the only surviving pre-indo-european language in europe . 
  yup . 
  slovenia is # 25 , next to finland and italy . 
  macedonia is # 84 , next to peru and thailand . 
  gdp is not a good indicator for standard of living in countries where much of the economy is owned by foreign companies . 
  how do you compute that ? 
  gdp per capita ? 
  should n't be a better measure the average ( or even better , median ) wage ? 
  average gross wage in macedonia is 510 $ , in slovenia it 's 1550 $ . 
  the difference was not as great as it is today . 
   the czech republic has low wages low , but enough to survive . 
  in romania , it 's hard to survive with the minimum gross wage of 200 $ / month .
