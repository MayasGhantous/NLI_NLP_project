  the 1998 election which brought chavez to power was democratic . 
  chavez was able to get most of the votes of the poorer sections of venezuelan society . 
  the `` chilean miracle '' is a myth was propagated because chile was the first neoliberal experiment . 
  it was an experiment . 
  it failed to create the economic growth , but it succeeded in bringing the wealth to a small elite at the expense of misery for the masses . 
  [ not even economically . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/gdp_per_capita_la-chile.png ) during the 1973-1990 , while pinochet was in power , chile had a lower gdp per capita than the rest of south america . 
  do you think that the 270 million indians who live on under $ 1.25 per day care that india is a nuclear state ? 
  and chile was not the first nor the last country with a democratically-elected leader to be overthrown by the us . 
  proud moments include : * iran 1953 -- democratically elected pm wanted to nationalize oil industry * guatemala 1954 -- democratically elected president wanted to nationalize the lands of united fruit company and distribute them to landless peasants * brazil 1964 -- democratically-elected government of brazil wanted to nationalize the oil refineries . 
  * chile 1973 -- democratically-elected president salvador allende nationalized the copper mines * venezuela 2002 -- democratically-elected president chavez nationalized oil industry . 
  i 'm not defending any case . 
  i just said that using examples is not a valid argument because there are counter-examples . 
  and a lot of people suffer or are killed by democratic countries abroad . 
  look at the history of south america . 
  bringing examples is pointless because you can find examples that are the other way around . 
  for instance , belarus is doing a lot better than a democracy like india . 
  * romanian - native * english -- watching cartoon network , the internet , at school * italian -- watching italian tv stations when i was a kid * french -- at school , reading french newspapers * spanish -- knowing the other languages , reading spanish newspapers . 
  `` terrorists '' or `` freedom fighters '' ? 
  what about old christian orthodox names like haralambie , parascheva , etc. 
  i 'd argue that those concessions are a feature , not a bug of the system . 
  if plenty of people care about an issue to vote for such a party , their voice should be heard . 
   reduce support for the welfare state by making the poor into a recognizable `` them '' and thereby to convince blonde scandis to accept a lower living standard . 
  the youth appear to be quite integrated , young men and women of different races seem to get along quite well , there are interracial couples . 
  in the long term , there wo n't be differences . 
  oh , by `` walked into a middle eastern country '' i thought you meant it actually looks like a middle eastern country , not like a normal northern european working class town with a bit more brown-skinned people . 
   but would you rather live in sweden i 'm now living for a few months in stockholm and it 's not the way the reddit white-power fans presents it . 
  i 'd describe it as working society , unlike britain or the us or eastern europe , where there are huge differences between the haves and have-nots . 
   runaway housing costs the reason is more complicated , but it 's mainly that that for decades , governments ignored the issue . 
  the current social-democratic government says they will build 100k housing units every year and they seem to do it : there 's a construction boom across stockholm . 
  [ the construction sector grew by almost 10 % in the last year ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150420/sweden-builds-future-as-eu-construction-falls ) . 
   nazis and commies fighting on the streets that 's definitely not a new thing . 
  just the topic changed : now it 's immigrants , a couple of decades ago it was about homosexuals . 
  violence was also present : for instance , 16 years ago , neo-nazis killed an anarcho-syndicalist [ bj\u00f6rn s\u00f6derberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bj\u00f6rn_s\u00f6derberg ) . 
  blaming it on immigration is stupid : it was a problem that existed before immigration boomed . 
   sweden regularly arms tyrants in the middle east they stopped supplying weapons to saudi arabia . 
  now it 's the united states ' job to do that . 
   or if you 've actually lived in sweden . 
  i 'm living in stockholm right now . 
  rent is high , but so are the wages . 
  also , i find it silly to blame the immigrants , who live in cheap housing in the suburbs for the high rents in premium locations of stockholm . 
   certain neighborhoods literally look like you 've walked into a middle eastern country . 
  oh , really ? 
  i 've been to those neighbourhoods . 
  yes , there are a lot of immigrants , but it does n't look like a middle eastern country . 
  [ this is what a `` bad '' neighbourhood ( tensta ) in stockholm looks like . 
  ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@59.395612,17.900216,3a,75y,278.12h,84.05t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sr18qgkkis7226-0_5nlpgq!2e0!6m1!1e1?hl=ro ) it definitely does n't look like a ghetto , it 's more like a working class area . 
  at most , they have a neutral effect on the growth of gdp per capita . 
  even though fewer of them are economically active , you have to consider that they are much younger than the swedish population as a whole , so the group has fewer retired people . 
  the ethnic swedes have a higher average age ( due to the high life expectancy ) , with many people economically inactive due to being retired . 
  ( the employment rate statistics is only about the 16-64 age group ) . 
  most immigrants are [ refugees ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140819/sweden-expects-100000-refugees-in-2014 ) and refugees may become swedish citizens after living 4 years in the country . 
  this means that the 50 % employment rate is just for recent immigrants . 
  the older immigrants and their children are included in the figure for swedish nationals , so part of the 80 % employment figure . 
  the 80 % figure is higher than the equivalent for uk , france , germany or any other major european country . 
   the social benefits western european society provides for it self are only possible by maintaining a high gdp per person . 
  mass migration would inevitably lower that stat currently , sweden receives more than 1 % of its population in immigrants each year . 
  about 20 % of the population already has foreign background . 
  and yet , its real gdp per capita is continuing to grow . 
  since 1993 , its population increased by 12 % and [ its real gdp per capita by more than 50 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bk8nold.png ) .

  when there are comments with a translation , i try to read the other language , if i can . 
  many brits would be good-looking if they lost some weight . 
   tl ; dr : the students want more money , more power , and less learning . 
  ** more money ** : they want more money to be invested in education . 
  they are right : romania has the lowest percentage of gdp of any eu country . 
  it 's not a coincidence that the most developed countries have the highest spending on education . 
  it 's this education that made them developed in the first place . 
  romanians ( 3,5 % of gdp for education ) are n't working less hard than swedes ( 7 % of gdp for education ) . 
  it 's just that we have low-skilled jobs , while the swedes are more educated and have high-skilled jobs . 
  ** more power ** : well , you want a dictatorial education in which the students have absolutely no say in their education ? 
  that 's what we have now . 
  ** less learning ** : you 're assuming that students learn anything from the current curriculum . 
  they do n't . 
  they rote learn what the professor wrote on the blackboard , which they reproduce identically on the exam paper , without understanding anything . 
  we pretend we learn a lot , while learning nothing . 
  you are afraid of not losing what you have . 
  we need to fight to gain those rights . 
  if kosovo je srbija , then crimea is ukraine . 
  either both , or none . 
   especially that stalin purged the leaders of the army ( executed 30,000 officers in 1937 ) actually , this atrocity may have actually brought an unexpected advantage for the soviets . 
  the officer class was indeed decimated by stalin 's paranoia , so they had to promote new officers . 
  whereas nazi germany had many old officers who were wwi veterans , the soviet union had a very young officer class . 
  during this total war , it was a great advantage to have officers who have a lot of energy , even if they were more inexperienced . 
  also , the german old officers studied at the academy 30-40 years before , back when the technology was much different , which is why they were not able to use to the full the technology they had . 
  and they are right to ask this . 
  they have to take whatever oportunity is offered . 
   millions of russian dies because your leaders were so shit . 
  the axis lost more than 5 million people during the invasion of ussr . 
  even if the soviet union were technically as developed as germany , they would have still lost a roughly equal number of military personel . 
  also , since the war was held on soviet land , there were huge numbers of civilians who died . 
  in addition to that , there were millions of soviet civilians ( particularly jews ) who were rounded up and killed by the german army . 
  there was no way to prevent millions of dead soviet people . 
  ... and we should allow scotland inside the eu , without any restrictions or penalties .
