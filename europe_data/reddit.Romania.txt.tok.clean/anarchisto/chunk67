  actually , syriza is doing what greeks want . 
  anti-americanism and russophilia have a long history in greece , it 's not something that came up with the crisis . 
  remember that greece had a civil war after wwii and that the us supported a military dictatorship in greece . 
   well since they arrived there completely unorganically what 's the organic way of arriving ? 
  was the romanian colonization of romanian dobruja organic ? 
  if not , should we divide it between bulgaria and turkey ? 
  was the austrian colonization of ukrainian bukovina with ukrainians/rusyns organic ? 
  if not , should that territory be given back to romania ? 
  i 'm sure there are territories like that across europe where states colonized various populations for many reason . 
  trying to give them back to the original population is pointless and opening the pandora 's box of nationalism and ethnic hate . 
  why ? 
  there 's no german population there anymore there , all the people there are russians . 
  i had a co-worker from moldova who spoke romanian without any strong accent , but when he spoke english , he spoke it with a strong russian accent . 
  i do n't know what 's the explanation for this . 
  yup . 
  by gdp per capita ( ppp , imf ) , it 's like this : * moldova $ 4.6 k * armenia $ 7k * georgia $ 7.1 k * ukraine $ 8.6 k * kosovo $ 8.8 k * bosnia $ 9.5 k, 
  ** romania ** vlad `` dr\u0103culea '' the impaler . 
   estimates of the number of his victims range from 40,000 to 100,000 . 
  ( wikipedia )   `` i have killed men and women , old and young , who lived at oblucitza and novoselo , where the danube flows into the sea , up to rahova , which is located near chilia , from the lower danube up to such places as samovit and ghighen . 
  we killed 23,884 turks and bulgars without counting those whom we burned in homes or whose heads were not cut by our soldiers ... thus your highness must know that i have broken the peace with him [ the sultan ] . '', 
  ( letter to matthias corvinus , the king of hungary ) most of these victims were turks and muslim bulgarians , so he is still considered some kind of a folk hero in romania . 
  however , his `` vampire '' reputation in europe is from a different origin , not from the turks , but from the germans . 
  the german merchants of transylvania were upset by what we would call today `` economic protectionism '' : vlad did n't allow foreign merchants to sell wares directly in fairs and markets in wallachia . 
  the german merchants would have to sell their wares whole-sale at the transylvanian-wallachian border to local wallachian merchants , who would then sell it in the country . 
   he has distaste for tea traitor !, 
  [ from wikipedia  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_tea_culture )  according to a 2005 study , some 82 % of russians consume tea daily, 
  no longer the last place in the eu . 
  thanks , latvia . 
  of course , that is not representative , either . 
  however , the 10 % dirt-poor people are just as representative as the upper-middle class . 
  that 's upper-middle class romania , which maybe represents 10 % of the population . 
  [ you could show this as well ] ( http://www.ziardecluj.ro/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/media/image/2013/09/pata-rat-cluj.jpg?itok=3rw_elup ) . 
  but he 's not going to be the only eu representative . 
  there 's going to be representatives from slovakia , greece and cyprus as well . 
  wait , there 's more : i 've seen greeks and albanians arguing whether the skirts the men wear ( fustanella ) is of greek or albanian origin . 
  i found it funny to see men arguing that `` our men wore skirts before yours ! '', 
   that concrete doric folly is absolutely hideous . 
  i like it . 
  it gives the feeling of ancient ruins taken over by vegetation . 
  he 's a journalist and political scientist quite active in the civil society and contributing weekly in journals like dilema veche for at least a decade . 
  if you follow the intellectual debates in romanian society , it 's most likely you find him , together with people like tism\u0103neanu , c\u0103rt\u0103rescu , hurezeanu , pippidi and a few others . 
  probably his opinion is not that important ( i 'd argue that no intellectual 's opinion is that important in romania ) , but he tells something that plenty of right-wing neoliberals in romania agree ( see the * \u00cen linie dreapt\u0103 * articles ) . 
  in the meantime , i hear [ voices ] ( http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/editoriale-opinii/articol/propaganda-ruseasca-mod-intrebuintare ) among the right-wing/neoliberal romanian intellectuals that it would be a good idea to give fines or send to prison the `` russian agents '' who do what he calls `` russian propaganda '' . 
  apparently , freedom of speech is acceptable only if you voice the state 's official ideology . 
  otherwise , you 're a `` traitor '' who should be sent to prison . 
  yes , but there would be no [ american military base in kosovo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camp_bondsteel ) hosting 7000 soldiers . 
  * slovakia : southern slovakia ( having hungarian majority ) * cyprus : northern cyprus ( turkish separatist state ) * spain : basque country , catalonia ( both having separatist movements ) * greece : see cyprus * romania : szekely land ( having hungarian majority ), 
  actually , she 's not a magyar , she 's a romanian born in the szekely region ( in sf\u00e2ntu gheorghe/sepsiszentgy \u00f6rgy ) and she married a hungarian ( hence the hungarian last name ) . 
  i think he/she meant that , being part of the single market , norway must accept eu imports that do n't respect their higher standards . 
  in order to have access to the single market , they need to apply the eu regulations . 
  the mayor of a city in romania received his bribes from local businessmen at night , in cash , in a cemetery . 
  that 's the right way to do it . 
  when prosecutors started investigating him , he hid the cash at his drivers ' countryside relative as well as inside a wall in his house . 
  the press loves heroes and she is one hero , but it 's not just her . 
  there are dozens of young prosecutors and judges who are under extreme pressure and , yet , they remain impossible to corrupt . 
  people love the anti-corruption agency , its trust rating rose to the roof : now more people trust them than they trust the church . 
  this is very peculiar in a country in which people generally trust no institution . 
  i do n't believe in conspiracy theories like the ones from / r/conspiracy or other reptilian jews controlling the world . 
  i do n't believe in conspiracy because when everything is done in plain view , it 's not a conspiracy . 
  just read a few books by noam chomsky . 
  you can not accept that other people have points of view different from yours ? 
  honest question . 
  out of tens of millions of muslims ( around 20 million in the eu ) , there are a few thousands of idiots who went to fight for isis . 
  the eu as a whole might not be fair , but it does have some fair institutions like the european parliament . 
   this is n't march 1990 anymore . 
  with enough funding for the extremist groups ( russia , hungary , it 's irrelevant ) , it 's going to be march 1990 again -- or worse . 
  that 's assuming that people do n't quit their religion . 
   a10s to be deployed against separatist armor columns well , that 's what i meant : they can only be used against `` separatist '' romanian citizens . 
  ( whether they 're ethnically romanians or hungarians is irrelevant ) . 
  should we accept unfair terms because the powerful are not fair ? 
  those weapons can not and will never be used against russians . 
  the russians are a nuclear power and before they could be used , the whole world would be destroyed by nuclear bombs . 
  the only case in which they are going to be used is against romanians during a potential violent conflict within romania . 
  there is no violent situation , but that was valid for every region where there was a civil war . 
  with enough hate and propaganda ( from whatever side ) , in every country you can start one . 
  orthodox vs. catholics , hungarian ethnics vs. romanian ethnics vs. roma ethnics . 
  even between regions . 
  bringing more weapons into a region only increases the potential of a conflict . 
   not even the un is like that of course the big powers do n't want equal partnerships and the big powers make the rules . 
  but that 's not a model of fairness to follow , imo . 
  we have some freedoms ( freedom of speech ) and we lack others ( political freedom , economic freedom ) . 
   we were actually on the brink of invading and seizing control of the country why would you invade a country your corporations and secret services already control ? 
  for instance , the control of the economy is almost absolute . 
  out of top 100 exporter companies in romania , 99 are foreign-owned . 
  it 's reassuring me who is really in charge . 
  nato is definitely not an equal partnership . 
  yeah , i know the theory : the troops are here to keep us free because we 're too stupid and weak to keep ourselves free . 
   the american troops in romania are not here to attack any state . 
  of course . 
  they 're here just to make sure we are behaving nice . 
  `` bad politics '' from berlin , paris and brussels or from athens ? 
  it would n't . 
  they 're just using the tragedy for their own purposes . 
   compulsory military service seems like it can do a lot of good for a country in poor countries , it encourages young men to flee the country rather than be slaves for a year . 
  i 'm sure that in norway or switzerland , people do n't leave to work and stay abroad , but in countries in eastern europe , that would be the case . 
  it 's ok , he 's our nato-friendly oligarch . 
  this guy is a professional flag burner . 
  he used gasoline , [ unlike the british nazi ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-nazi-filmed-spectacularly-failing-to-burn-eu-flag-in-protest-against-forced-immigration-10141197.html ) . 
  the hungarians are not even huns .
