  they have 100 prosecutors and 5000 ongoing cases . 
  last year , there were more than 1000 convictions , including dozens of government ministers and mps . 
  but if they continue the way they did last year , they 'll reach all the big cases in a few years . 
  they 've done studies about this : it wo n't make a difference for the current smokers , but it 'd make less likely other people ( particularly teenagers ) to start smoking . 
  most smokers start as teenagers and branding is a major factor in making smoking `` cool '' . 
  no , they just mend the old infrastructure already existing when it breaks . 
  according to the privatization contract , they were supposed to do a lot investments , but they simply refused to do them . 
  some rather big peripheral areas of bucharest lack water and sewerage infrastructure . 
  they were supposed to have water supply to all of them until 2010 . 
  not even today there is water supply to them . 
  the city hall began a program using its own money to do it and they hope in a few years they 'll do it . 
  this company probably spends a few million euros a year in bribes to the city hall and government officials to keep quiet about this contract . 
  over the years , they did get a few million euros in fines , but that 's nothing compared with cumulative profits of hundreds of millions euros . 
  they get annually 20 million $ in profits -- at least officially , here multinationals tend to hide their profits using all kinds of tricks . 
  water price in bucharest after 15 years of privatized water ( this does not include sewerage price , which is additional to it ) : * 2000 : 0,16 lei ( 0,08 $ ) / cubic meter * 2015 : 5,75 lei ( 1,30 $ ) / cubic meter -- * the water price in lei increased 35 times . 
  * the water price in euro increased 17 times . 
  * globally the prices ( inflation in lei ) increased 3.5 times . 
  ok , so he changed his mind in the meantime ? 
  a while ago he said this exactly backwards : that not calling it marriage should not be a problem for the homosexuals . 
  socially progressive ? 
  modern party ? 
  then why do they oppose the idea of same-sex marriages ? 
  they say calling it `` marriage '' creates unneeded tensions in the society . 
  [ danish numbers are a threat to us all !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrgihrs3hki ), 
  all abrahamic faiths are obsessed with the apocalypse . 
  i see this in american evangelicals and christian zionists , who support israel in order to bring the end of days . 
  ( the more i read about this , the more i 'm amazed ) also , radical islam is so strong because the us was so darn good in getting rid of communists and secular nationalists in the arab world . 
  a few decades ago , arab people who felt disenfranchised became either communists or moderate nationalists ( usually of a socialist sort ) , both movements being secular and wanting to modernize and unite the arab nation . 
  greece , with all its fall in standards of living , is still above romania and bulgaria . 
  if there is a humanitarian crisis in greece ( and i tend to agree with this ) , then the same is valid for large proportions of the romanians , bulgarians and some smaller parts of hungarians and slovakians . 
  the difference is that people in eastern europe have been used to these low standards , whereas greeks went from western standards to poverty . 
  governments and people in power sometimes act according to their own interests , which may or may not be in the interest of the country . 
  according to documents released by wikileaks , former sweden foreign minister carl bildt has been spying for the united states since the 1970s . 
  is that really in the interest of sweden ? 
  of course , i might be wrong and swedish intelligence might know more about iran , but i feel it 's more about international power-blocks than about being a real threat . 
  so isis is an imagined threat ? 
  i thought at least 300 swedes have already joined them . 
  i think that 's a pretty important direct threat to sweden , imo . 
  there are two main causes for isis : american interventions and saudi money . 
  i do n't think we can stop the americans from doing this , but we definitely can do more to stop saudi money from being used to foment extremist in europe and the middle east . 
  this article is from 18 march , so they did n't get the memo yet . 
   the wahhabist funding does not come from the saudi state but from wealthy saudi individuals ( often saudi family members ) in saudi arabia , there is no clear delimitation between the state and the saud family . 
  basically , the saud family is the state . 
  from a 2010 financial times article :  in spite of the king 's efforts , the lines between the state and personal wealth of senior princes have become blurred . 
  [ ... ] `` the king and the state really are the same -- asking how rich the king of saudi arabia is a bit like asking how rich parliament is in britain , '' says another expert . 
  --  china is interested in stealing high tech or competitor business information , sweden is not an interesting target in this regard sweden does have a lot of high-tech industry , including weaponry , which china might be willing to steal . 
  as an intelligence threat , china is definitely bigger . 
  they might not be very aggressive ( yet ? ), 
  and they mostly use their secret services to get trade secrets , but they 're really a force lately . 
  a much bigger threat to world peace is saudi arabia due to their public funding of wahhabism and private funding of various terrorist groups . 
  i see that iran is trying to negotiate with the united states ; it 's israel ( or rather , bibi ) that is the warmonger there , trying to derail any deals . 
  iran does n't do what the united states wants . 
  sweden does what the united states wants , including copying its list of enemies . 
   iraq , that was americans . 
  what about libya ? 
  was n't it monsieur sarkozy 's pet project ? 
  according to opinion polls , we , europeans , do n't trust our press , just like we do n't trust our politicians . 
  there 's a general crisis of trust and the people are right : neither the press nor the politicians are trustworthy . 
  blaming russia for this or creating more propaganda is not going to help . 
  what we need a serious overhaul of the way our democracy works . 
  no , it 's not worth it . 
  romania built in dobruja the `` danube-black sea canal '' and it cost $ 2 billion ( in the 1980s ) . 
  it was supposed to get its money back in 50 years , but it gets a yearly profit of 3 million $ , so it 's going to take a few centuries to get its money back . 
  italians should follow the example of their maltese neighbours : they 're more catholic than the pope and yet , they 're tolerant with the gays . 
   now , seriously : why are the italians so reluctant about gay marriage or at least civil unions ? 
   the cost of living for the workers and the cost of doing business were not taken into account then maybe we should take the cost of living for the workers in account . 
  if the cost of living in rural romania is 1/4 of the cost of living in paris , those people should have 1/4 of the wage of a parisian , not 1/20 like it is now . 
  culture . 
  each missile has 25 kg of cultural payload . 
  i guess that even from a right-wing point of view , syriza can be considered necessary . 
  without syriza , it would be possible that some * real * radicals would have eventually got the power . 
  and by real radicals i mean people who want to completely remove the capitalist system , not try to fix it like them . 
  they do have a primary surplus , so their current expenses are lower than their incomes . 
  the deficit is only because of the debt . 
  actually , they 're to the right of the mainstream european social-democratic parties of the 1960s and 1970s . 
  it 's just that we 're comparing them with the current `` left-wing '' parties which never support left-wing policies anymore . 
  i 'm not talking about `` relative poverty '' . 
  i 'm talking about malnutrition , contaminated water supply , lack of indoor plumbing and `` severe material deprivation '' as the eu calls it . 
  about the same price as the 163-floor burj khalifa . 
  of course the costs in germany are higher , but still ... 
  it 's at least double the amount of other similar buildings . 
  in the eu , it just started , so we ca n't tell yet the results . 
  but we can look at the us and britain : a bank of england report said that [ `` britain 's richest 5 % gained most from quantitative easing '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/23/britains-richest-gained-quantative-easing-bank ) ( the guardian ) `` quantitative easing has marked the biggest transfer of wealth to the rich of any government policy in recent documented history '' ( conservative magazine [ spectator ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/08/qe-the-ultimate-subsidy-for-the-rich/ ) ) `` the irony is that paul krugman , coming from the left , is very keen on a policy that is making these people even richer . '', 
  ( [ the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2013/06/investing-and-monetary-policy ) ) `` soros : european stimulus will benefit the rich '' ( [ cnn ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/23/news/economy/soros-european-stimulus-inequality-world-economic-forum/ ) ) . 
  `` piketty : fed 's huge stimulus mostly benefits the rich '' ( [ newsmax ] ( http://www.newsmax.com/finance/economy/piketty-fed-income-wealth/2014/06/02/id/574625/ ) ), 
  i heard that this is a common theme : unknown people get into the middle of the protesters , attack the police , then disappear . 
  the police arrests the regular protesters . 
  the greek welfare state was never very big , even before the crisis . 
  greece had a lower social spending as percentage of gdp than almost all the western european countries ( sweden , denmark , france , austria , belgium , germany , italy , finland , portugal , spain ) . 
  they were not allowed to settle in the countryside , which indeed , was the `` normal profession '' back then . 
  but jews were not mostly bankers . 
  the bankers were just a tiny minority . 
  most jews during the middle ages were merchants , shopkeepers and craftsmen ( for instance , goldsmiths ) . 
  in frankfurt , there 's a crowd of 10.000 protesters and a couple dozen idiots . 
  the press never looks at the 10.000 people , but they always look at the idiots and claim all the protesters are like that . 
  homelessness is a serious problem . 
  maybe not in helsinki , but almost everywhere else . 
   the eu estimates the number of homeless people to be 4.1 million ( [ dw ] ( http://www.dw.de/empty-property-in-eu-could-house-all-of-europes-homeless-and-more/a-17463912 ) ) however , i do n't agree that building apartment buildings would help . 
  across the eu there are already 11 million vacant homes , almost three houses for each homeless person .
