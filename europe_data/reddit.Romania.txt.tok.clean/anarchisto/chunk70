  inequality is not tackled in europe . 
  let me remind you that in eastern european members of the eu , millions work for 150-200 $ / month . 
  that 's close to african level of poverty . 
  because , while parts of eurozone are squeezed out of the last penny , the ecb spends 1.2 billion $ on a building . 
  qe is not helping the regular people , but only the elite . 
  of course , at a macroeconomic level it 's good that it stopped the decline , but regular people do n't see any benefits , only increased disparity between the rich few and the rest . 
  they 're using tear gas as well . 
  they 're only partially wrong . 
  ecb is indeed applying policies that affect negatively hundreds of millions . 
  however , it 's not up them to decide these policies . 
  the power to change them is in berlin and paris .

   working minimum wage as a cashier ? 
  russia has always been the friend of greece . 
  it 's not just religion , but also geopolitics : the big power next to greece ( or including greece ) was the ottoman empire , and for centuries the greatest enemy of the ottomans has been russia . 
  the west is not very popular in greece because their interests often were against the interests of greece . 
  for instance , during the crimean war , britain , france and italy fought on the ottomans ' side against russia and greece . 
  without the western intervention ( 650,000 soldiers !, 
  ) , it 's likely that constantinople and the aegean coast of turkey ( which was mostly greek ) would have been today part of greece . 
  their government expenses are in roubles , while much of their income ( oil and gas ) is in dollars . 
  they do n't need an oil price $ 100/bbl ; they need an oil price of around 6000 roubles/bbl . 
  when the oil price fell , they simply let the rouble slide against the dollar , in order to keep the government income constant . 
  i do n't support macovei . 
  she was the vicepresident of the democratic-liberal party back when its funding came chiefly from bribes , as the last few months of corruption trials showed . 
  i do n't believe what she says that she did n't knew where the money came from . 
  if the top leadership of the party did n't know , then who knew ? 
  the conspiracy theorists say he was charged with corruption because a month ago he said he does n't want to continue the imf agreement . 
  ( he did get bribes , but then , every government minister does this ) we just need to wait and see if the new minister will sign a new deal with the imf this year . 
   we just need the bad apples out . 
  there are no good apples in the mainstream parties . 
  i know honest people who tried to join in the mainstream parties . 
  they were eventually kicked out . 
  i 'm sure they can find in a 20 million nation a dozen new crooks to fill the government . 
  so far there is no real political alternative to the mainstream parties ( social-democrats , allegedly center-left and liberals , allegedly center-right ) . 
  these parties can not be reformed , but they have the money since they have the support of the oligarchy which got rich through corruption . 
  now , about the alternatives : * there are a bunch of groups of left-wing groups ( from scandinavian social-democrats to quasi-revolutionary socialists ) -- nice people , they have good intentions , but they have neither the money , nor the organizational power of the large parties . 
  * the libertarians of macovei - they want the state to privatize everything , from schools to the healthcare system and the state should just contract private companies to do anything . 
  i do n't see how this would solve the corruption problem because that 's how corruption started in the first place . 
  sufism . 
  a mystical form of islam which values meditation and philosophy . 
  it 's quite different from regular islam , i 'd say it has a bit in common with zen buddhism . 
  also hungary 's orban complained that the norwegians are illegally financing opposition parties ( a small green party ) . 
  exactly . 
  but i do n't think the russian secret services want a nice guy or a west-friendly president . 
  today , the russian secret services are stronger than they were in 1991 and the people on their top are like-minded people . 
  if putin dies , most likely they 'd support a person with similar background , vision and goals . 
  most likely , it wo n't be medvedev ( who is probably too weak to be a supreme leader ) , but someone like [ sergei ivanov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergei_ivanov ) . 
  this is also the kind of person which the russian people want . 
  they definitely do n't want a `` pro-western '' leader because they associate such people with the corruption and poverty of the late 1990s . 
   he was n't the macho jerk putin is . 
  for the latter part of his rule , he was barely conscious . 
  his `` family '' made all the decisions for him . 
  putin got in power by proving himself loyal to the yeltsin `` family '' and the sorrounding oligarchs . 
  it was only after he got the power , that he began a war against those powerful oligarchs . 
  that 's their line of thought . 
  i did n't judge whether they 're right or wrong . 
   it 's sad that there are people out there who feel entitled to steal someone else 's property without any regard to the owner . 
  they think the society was not fair to them , so they 're unfair to the society . 
   is it mostly gypsies that do this ? 
  they belong to a rather underclass living in precarious conditions . 
  many of them ( but by no means all ) are roma people . 
   do people ever steal from them to see how they like it ? 
  [ i do n't think there 's much to steal from them ] ( http://www.ziardecluj.ro/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/media/image/2013/09/pata-rat-cluj.jpg ) . 
  then i 'm expecting for a norwegian military invasion anytime . 
  ( expensive stolen bikes from norway end up for sale here at a fraction of their original price ), 
  maybe the phrasing is wrong , but the idea is correct . 
  a geiger counter can be used to detect alpha radiation , but the alpha radiation from the poisoning would be stoppped by the skin anyway , so it would not be possible to detect it using the counter . 
  we are making progress in punishing the politicians , but so far , there has been absolutely no change in the actual corruption rate . 
  it is possible that , in the long term , things will change , but as long as the parties are basically clubs for corrupt businessmen in which honest people are not allowed , there wo n't be any change . 
   the romanians overtake them in prosperity , quality of live unfortunately , our government and politicians are more corrupt than even the orban government ... 
  it 's much harder to bribe hundreds of people than a dozen people . 
  the eu would be perfect if we had a stronger parliament which would then form its own council , pretty much like the country governments are formed by parliamentary parties . 
  so you 're complaining about racism using a misogynist argument ? 
  china , india , iran and south america will not isolate russia . 
  they want it as a hub , the chinese going to visiting the rest of europe . 
  hungary can not into mountains ? 
   the country that raped our women iirc , there was a book which said that rapes were widespread in the american , british and french occupation sectors as well . 
   stole our factories the same thing happened in the west . 
  there 's a funny story : ford britain was offered by the us/uk governments the volkswagen factory , but their director refused , arguing its technology was too antiquated to be worth anything . 
  that factory built the beetle , which took over the world . 
   killed our men this is what happens when you invade another country . 
  isis happened because they tried the belgian model without waffles . 
  well , if they consider themselves russian , they are russian . 
  are you claiming that mongolian-americans are not true americans because they 're not wasps ? 
  but in crimea the majority of people are not only `` russian-speaking '' people ( like in eastern ukraine ) , but people who actually identify as `` russians '' ( according to the last census ) . 
  in 1945 , there were few communists , but there were plenty of communists . 
  in 1980 , there were many communists , but few communists . 
  due to repression ( thousands of communists sent to prison , etc. ), 
  the romanian communist party had few members right before 1944 , fewer than a thousand . 
  but there were plenty of people who agreed in principles with the many of the ideas , even if they were not willing to participate . 
  with time , the communist party got plenty of members who were mostly willing to participate not due to ideological reasons , but for the perks . 
  well , crimea does have a russian ethnic majority . 
  if a democratically elected government will tell them to go home , a coup will happen . 
  it does n't matter what people think . 
  this chart is not only about electricity , but of all energy . 
  norway , for instance , has 99.5 % of its electricity from hydropower . 
   romania is not an american client state like it was a soviet client state . 
  it 's the same thing ; actually , the us have more control over romania than the ussr had during ceau\u0219escu .
