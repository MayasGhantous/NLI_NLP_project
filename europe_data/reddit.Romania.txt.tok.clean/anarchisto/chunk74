  of course , this would never happen . 
  if this would actually be implemented in the eu and multinationals would be forced to pay tax in the countries where they operate , it would help eastern european countries a lot . 
  the biggest companies here are multinationals and these multinationals are always headquartered abroad , mostly in western europe . 
  they use transfer prices and they often do n't pay any profit tax here . 
  read the history of liberia . 
  it 's fascinating how former slaves became the masters in liberia and how they created a little piece of southern us in africa . 
  a colony of a colony , enslaved by former slaves !, 
  oil , gas and oil products exports were 70 % of all exports in 2012 . 
  the yearly average oil price halved in 2015 compared to 2014 ( from $ 99 to $ 52 ) , meaning that the russian exports should have dropped by one third . 
  this seems to be supported by their statistics : [ according to their official figures ] ( http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b04_03/isswww.exe/stg/d06/35.htm ) , it went down $ 496 billion to $ 343 billion , that 's $ 153 billion , or 7 % of gdp . 
  so basically , excluding the oil and gas price drop , they had a 3.3 % growth . 
  most is probably due to decrease of revenue from oil exports . 
  between 2014 and 2015 , oil price halved , which basically decreased the russian exports by a third . 
  [ average oil price ( yearly average ) ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/262860/uk-brent-crude-oil-price-changes-since-1976/ ) : * 2014 : $ 99 * 2015 : $ 52, 
   the democratic people 's republic of north korea is a communist country on paper , it 's a communist-ruled country . 
  but on paper , it 's also a `` democratic republic '' . 
   the simple truth that communism in all its different costumes always fails we only had communism in one costume : marxism-leninism . 
  all `` real socialist '' countries were based on this model . 
   requires the creation of an absolute organ of centralised social power this is what marxism-leninism says and i strongly disagree with them . 
  anarchists explained in 19th century ( before there was any marxist state ) why centralized marxism will fail and it will lead towards corruption and abuse from a clique of bureaucrats and leaders . 
  they were right about this . 
  north korea is an absolute monarchy . 
   was on purpose made to regress their economies the goal was never to make eastern europe poor ( no one cared about how poor or rich we are ) , it was to kill all the companies which could have been competition to western companies . 
  out of the top 100 exporters in romania , not even one is romanian-owned . 
  all of them are foreign-owned , most of them western european . 
  british food may be bad , but at least there 's a lot of it !, 
  you 're comparing apples with oranges . 
  1938 ppp dollars with 1990 exchange dollars . 
  [ so in 1990 , in ppp , you have  ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:prt:grc:esp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:prt:rom&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) * portugal : $ 11198 * romania $ 5198 and the difference is not because of a better system in portugal , but rather many factors such as : * portugal was not involved in wwii * many billions of dollars were sent in by the european union to portugal . 
   and all of them had better a education/economy than we did by 1989 . 
  all of those had better education/economy before the soviets came , too . 
  we used to have the highest illiteracy rate in europe and we had an agriculture-based economy , having one of the most rural populations . 
  after wwii , when the communists took over , there were still 4.2 million illiterate adults in romania . 
  the communists created mandatory schools for illiterate adults . 
  intellectuals , including university professors , joined the volunteer organizations to teach the peasants to read and write . 
  of course , many of the volunteers joined just because they were afraid they could lose their job ... 
  anyway , within 6 years , illiteracy was eradicated . 
  there were lots of things going wrong during the stalinist 1950s , but stamping out illiteracy was a big achievement . 
   it is interesting how the most educated regions in moldavia were gobbled up by ukraine that 's because those regions did not have an ethnic romanian majority ... 
  `` the military should not stop us declaring an islamic republic '', 
  http://www.ibtimes.com/homeless-bus-ticket-programs-across-nation-offer-little-accountability-poor-housing-2016812  for years , oklahoma city tackled its homeless problem by handing out bus tickets to other cities to its down-and-out residents . 
  but once the homeless arrived at their destination , they were often greeted with a new one-way bus ticket , as city leaders across the nation increasingly embraced the practice of busing out the poor , a solution that solved the immediate problem of reducing a municipality 's homeless crisis without actually finding housing for the needy . 
    the practice , criticized as `` homeless dumping , '' has been quietly embraced by local government leaders since the early 2000s in an effort to diminish the public visibility of the poor and avoid costly services . 
   most major u.s. cities have been cleaning up their downtown areas they 've been cleaning them by bussing the homeless to other cities . 
   sf is a sanctuary city i do n't think the homeless in sf are illegal immigrants . 
  the accents i heard from them are definitely not mexican .

   not many mayors left standing 5 out of the 7 mayors in bucharest elected in 2012 are now in jail : * mayor of bucharest : ~ ~ oprescu ~ ~ * district 1 : ~ ~ chiliman ~ ~ * district 2 : ~ ~ on\u021banu ~ ~ * district 3 : negoi\u021b\u0103 * district 4 : ~ ~ piedone ~ ~ * district 5 : ~ ~ vanghelie ~ ~ * district 6 : m\u0103nescu, 
  italians think that italy is either the best ( best food , best art , best fashion , etc. ), 
  or the worst ( worst government , worst organized crime , etc. 
  ) , depending on the subject . 
  i suspect that people who say `` they 're popping them like candy '' have no idea what they 're talking . 
  the side effects may be quite tough : a few days of nausea and headaches . 
   women especially young ones are popping this like candies why would they do this ? 
  day-after pills can make you feel so sick ( nausea , headaches , dizziness , etc. ), 
  that you 'd wish you 'd never have to do it again . 
  also , not having easy access to emergency contraception might lead to more abortions , which are definitely worse for the women .

  ukraine lost its main export market : russia . 
  sweden has similar policies and they have no oil . 
  some people want to have more kids , but they know they can not afford it or that it would be hard for them . 
  these people are the target for these laws . 
   due to good social planning . 
  exactly . 
  it may seem that the government has nothing to do with the number of kids , but that 's not true . 
  france , sweden and norway have : * tax discounts for families with 2 or 3 kids * cheap or free childcare * various measures to help the women have both a career and kids . 
   women who are promiscuous tend to have less stable marriages and have fewer kids . 
  norwegian women have more kids than women in most other countries in europe .

  it 's called capitalism if you bribe your way to get the mineral resources of a country . 
  it 's called colonialism if you get involved ( using threat of military force ) in the politics of that country in order to get or keep those mineral resources . 
  there have been countless coups and assassinations in which france had some role . 
  companies from most western countries do the first one ; the us and france do the second one as well . 
  southern romania , in the arge\u0219 county, 
  when there is a civil war , one of the sides may ask for foreign intervention . 
  sometimes it 's the `` government '' , other times , it 's the `` rebels '' . 
  france intervened on the side of the `` government '' in mali and on the side of the `` rebels '' in libya . 
  both are cases of colonialism , a disease of which france still suffers . 
  mali is just a piece of a greater puzzle of fran\u00e7afrique . 
  it may have absolutely no worth ; it could even be a net gain for france if it were to lose its influence in there , but france can not show itself weak , or it would lose the other countries in the region as well . 
   aimed at foreign military personnel present in the country i do n't like their ideology , but i do n't like european colonialism in africa , either . 
  yeah , and it 's such a great government !, 
  there has been no military coup in almost 4 years !, 
  and the french troops are there to protect the former colonies , not to protect a quasi-colonial system that has been plaguing that part of africa for many generations ? 
  thanks , i got it . 
  terrorists = rebels we do n't like ? 
   mali terrorism are they really terrorists if they attack foreign military facilities on their soil ? 
  some parts of romania as well . 
  the village where my grandmother was born had this custom as well . 
  i do n't think i understand your argument . 
  if the word had been inherited from latin , it must have existed in some form in the common language from before the split . 
  if the word appeared after the split , then it 's not inherited . 
  if that were the case , then aromanian ( or the other southern languages and dialects related to romanian ) would have that word as well . 
  but they do n't have it , which supports the view that it 's a recent borrowing . 
  in aromanian , they do n't have a word for `` yes '' and they typically say `` este '' ( '' [ this ] is [ it ] '' ) instead . 
  for every slavic word in romanian ( and we have many thousands ; in fact more than words inherited from latin ) , there is an ( often illogical ) explanation that it 's actually a latin word . 
  one example is `` cr\u0103ciun '' ( christmas ) , which is obviously derived from the slavic pagan holiday * kra\u010dun * ( or \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0443\u043d in russian ) , but we like to pretend it 's derived from latin `` creationis '' ( creation ) . 
  the swedes back then were probably very strong . 
   so ... who has more than chf 1000 . - to offer ? 
  : ^ ) china 's biggest banknote is 100 cny , which is 15 chf .
