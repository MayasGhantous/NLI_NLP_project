   fuck your nurse actually , the english word is `` midwife '', 
  it also related with the small , but growing middle-class that has some standards of living close to western ones . 
  this middle-class is overwhelmingly made out of people working in technology : programming , it , engineering . 
  i remember that according to a poll among high school students , almost half wanted to be programmers and/or engineers . 
  there 's virtually guaranteed employment and wages far higher than the median . 
  in romania , the median after-tax earnings is under 300 $ / month ( average is around 400 $ ) , whereas programmers can get 5-10 times that . 
  the mob in this subreddit does n't think they 're `` people '' . 
  the peaks are irrelevant to the fertility rate . 
  the fertility rate is calculated by adding up the average fertility by age : * the 15 year olds have on average 0.0001 children * the 16 year olds have on average 0.0006 children * ... * the 30 year olds have on average 0.15 children etc. 
  it does n't matter how many 30 or 31 year olds are in the population , it only matters how many of them have children in that particular year . 
   they are only voting for or against giving the urkaine hope of being able to join sometime in the future . 
  candidate states get money as well , they 're called `` pre-accession funds '' . 
   why would they vote no ? 
  maybe because ukraine would be a huge financial burden for the eu . 
  reminds me of this quote from henry kissinger :  `` i do n't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people . 
  the issues are much too important for the chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves . '', 
  we are `` freeriders '' because we do n't spend enough for bolstering american imperialism ? 
   islam is the fastest growing religion on the planet how can you tell that in 10 or 20 years , those people you assume to be muslims will not become atheists ? 
  some of them are already atheists , just afraid to say it out loud . 
  i personally know young `` muslims '' living in the gulf states , north africa or iran who are actually atheists , even though they would never say that out loud because they 'd suffer some consequences . 
  the internet is eroding religiosity across the world , it 's just a matter of time before an anti-religious revolution in the arab countries will occur . 
   idk how much france had a hippie movement [ their hippie movement ( far-left progressives ) was so strong in france that they almost had a revolution in may 1968 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_1968_events_in_france ), 
  all projections about what people will believe in the future are nonsense . 
  there 's no way we can predict what people will think in a year , let alone in 40 years . 
  it means that all the power in now centralized : since the mps have no power now ( they can be changed at the whims of the party bosses ) , there 's no point in having a parliament . 
  the ruling party could just write legislation without any need for a complicated parliamentary procedure . 
   syrians are just 1.7 % of the total number of fighters . 
  i knew that syrians were fewer than 10 % , but this is surprisingly low . 
  it 's as if it 's a foreign invasion , not a local rebellion . 
   make romanians pay for the costs that sounds like an idea of trump : to build a wall and make mexicans pay the costs . 
  the aristocracy is now made out of corporations . 
  the number of lobbyists in brussels is insane : 30.000 of them , second only to washington dc . 
  because , without doing this , the eu will break apart and , in time , it will become just a group of irrelevant middle-income countries , unable to compete with the united states or china , which have the scale of their economies on their side . 
   for the most part , it does n't seem like anyone , elected official or civilian , can actually do anything to effect the eu government . 
  that 's because the current system has been crafted so that the lobbyists have the power to write the european legislation . 
  we vote for the european parliament members , but that institution has little power . 
  the parliament has the power to veto the laws written by the lobbyists , but not to write its own legislation . 
  the actual power lies in the european commission , which is a very undemocratic institution , having commissionaires chosen behind closed doors , in secret negociations . 
   the eu is just too diverse to work as one body it would work great if the eu would be more like the united states , having a central government and transfers between the poor states and the rich ones . 
  but that wo n't happen because there 's no way that germany and france would give up on their power . 
  they do n't want a powerful united europe anymore ( like the politicians who actually created the eu ) , they want their own countries to be powerful , at the expense of everyone else . 
   we need to put the uk in charge of the eurozone fiscal policy . 
  i noticed that good ideas that stimulate growth and decrease inequality are supported only by former central banks chiefs , not by current ones . 
  that 's more likely than ukraine joining the eu . 
  it 's not about wood , it 's about forests . 
  authoritarianism and paternalism have a long history in germany ... 
  yeah , the afghanistan invasion was a nato opperation . 
   there are no mechanisms to get around the monarch and there 's also no mechanism to replace them . 
  the french invented the guillotine as a mechanism exactly for that . 
  near the village where my grandparents were born , a forest was recently razed . 
  it was bought by a frenchman who razed it for the wood and agricultural land ( apparently , recently razed land is very fertile ) . 
  i do n't know if he had an approval , but i know that with a small bribe , you can get approval to do anything in romania . 
  the map does n't include everything . 
  in romania , there are at least 100 places with the names like `` s\u00e2n - '' or `` sf\u00e2ntul - '' , many of them in transylvania ( villages such as s\u00e2ngeorgiu , s\u00e2ncraiu , s\u00e2nmartin , s\u00e2nmihaiu , s\u00e2nnicolau , s\u00e2npetru , s\u00e2nt\u0103m\u0103ria , s\u00e2ntioana , etc. ), 
  they support hillary because they think bernie would not be able to do anything he promises ... 
   ok . `` child molester '' of a i think 17 year old girl well , he was her yoga teacher . 
  according to romanian law , teachers are not allowed to have sex with underage students , so he broke the law . 
   looked and acted quite mature for it 's age i do n't think how mature looks a girl is relevant . 
  nah , the gypsies and romanian politicians are doing the same thing . 
   last week , two ethnic roma mps were charged with embezzlement of eu funds intended to help the roma community . 
  ( to promote employment ), 
  merkel 's `` humane '' refugee policies were anything but humane . 
  the result was that ** thousands of refugees drowned ** . 
  i ca n't see how this is the humane option . 
  the humane option would have been to take refugees directly from refugee camps and ** return any illegal migrants ** back to the camps , to discourage the dangerous sea trip . 
  this way you can pick and choose : * you can pick ** families with small children ** first , who are in a more pressing need than young males ( it 's hard to get an education in a refugee camp for your children ) . 
  also , generally the crime rates for married people are substantially lower than for the young males and they 're more willing to integrate , for the sake of their children . 
  * you can pick an equal number of males and females , to prevent a gender imbalance . 
  * you can verify their background ( including nationality ) , you can reduce the number of isis members from coming into europe . 
  * you can get the number of refugees you want , making planning easier . 
  i propose replacing those mps with a bunch of rowdy 8 years old . 
  they 'll do the same job , but at least they wo n't be involved in expenses fraud . 
  no hungarians in romania ? 
  * a francba !, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  are you denying the slavic influence or what ? 
  the romanian and probably hungarian words are calques of the slavic word , which in turn might be an iranian ( most likely scythian or sarmatian ) influence . 
  there are other possible iranian borrowings : for instance , the word for `` god '' in slavic is `` bog '' , which some linguists believe to have been borrowed from iranian , making it cognate with `` bagh '' in `` baghdad '' ( `` given by god '' in middle persian , thus cognate with slavic name `` bogdan '' ) . 
  the ethnic names of some slavic nations such as `` serb '' and `` croat '' may have been of iranian origin , but this is also not very clear . 
  do you have some actual data , or are you just making things up ? 
  i know a few middle-class swedes who have 3 kids , which is very uncommon here in romania for middle-class people . 
  the people voted for the extreme-left * because * they 're poor . 
  religious activities should not be allowed to be funded from outside the eu . 
  i do n't care it 's radical islam or anti-abortion and anti-gay organizations from the us , i do n't see any reason to allow them to bring money to preach their hate . 
   but the reasons are economic , not political , says the deputy mayor . 
  so it 's a town from a poor state ( gdp/capita = 25k $ ) which wants to become part of a richer state ( gdp/capita = 41k $ ) . 
  birth rates in france and sweden are much higher than for germany and italy . 
   it 's not compatible with the laws that 's valid everywhere , only that in some places , the authorities ignore those laws . 
   i do n't think i 've ever heard anyone refer to the allied bombing of dresden as a terrorist attack . 
  churchill criticized it as an `` act of terror '' a few weeks after it happened , asking the military to focus on military objectives . 
  in this definition , every state that ever existed is a terrorist entity . 
   international treaties are only valid in the peace time . 
  by this argument , turkey 's membership to the european convention on human rights is void and null because there was never peace and there will never be peace in turkey unless kurdistan secedes . 
  they were already in war with the pkk . 
  now they have a reason to attack ypg as well . 
  the commonly accepted definition of terrorism is `` attacking civilians or non-combatants '' . 
  when attacking military troops , it 's just war . 
  if the attackers had turkish citizenship , then it 's civil war . 
  it 's like that in real life .
