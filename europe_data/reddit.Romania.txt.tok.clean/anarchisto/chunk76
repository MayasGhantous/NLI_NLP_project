  [ so this is the traditional way of eating pasta !, 
  the anti-corruption agency has plenty of raw material to process . 
   state intervention is the exact opposite of capitalism , which is what dumping is . 
  the chinese produce steel cheaper than europeans : * chinese workforce is substantially cheaper ( read `` badly-paid workers '' ) than the european workforce * the chinese built their industry recently , using the latest technologies ( more efficient ) , whereas europe has a lot of `` heritage '' industry that was state-of-the-art a few decades ago . 
  i do n't think there were many big steel plants built recently in europe . 
  * economy of scale : they produce half of the world 's steel in huge plants . 
  eu produces only a tenth of world 's steel . 
  * all raw materials ( iron , coal , electricity ) are provided by state-owned companies which have zero ( or close to zero ) profits . 
  * the steel companies themselves have razor-thin profits due to oversupply on their local market . 
  they should n't worry . 
  they can keep their reputation for corruption in the eu , like we did . 
  moldova , obviously . 
  we speak the same language and share a lot of history . 
  they are much poorer and they have plenty of problems , but we still love them . 
  i hope some day , the love will be mutual . 
   they get alot more money begging there than working here , let alone getting benefits a beggar in sweden gets 600 $ / month . 
  ( 20 $ / day , including weekends ) a minimum wage worker in romania gets 175 $ / month . 
  ( more than a third of romanian employees get this salary ) a person on benefits in romania gets 29 $ / month . 
   romania and bulgaria should take care of their citizens we do n't take care of our ethnic romanians , let alone unpopular minorities . 
  true . 
  but this is a reason to have 500 $ banknotes rather than 100 $ or 50 $ banknotes : they take less space , making it less likely for the thieves to find them . 
  exactly . 
  my romanian bank has a 0.2 % interest rate for euro deposits and a 0.1 % interest rate for us dollars . 
  cashing out us dollars or euro has a 0.5 % charge , so it takes years ( 2.5 years for euro , 5 years for dollars ) before you even break even !, 
  it makes absolutely no sense to have money in a deposit , especially since there is a ( higher than zero ) risk associated with the bank 's possible collapse . 
   i 'll applaud the day when something is done about the `` valley of the fallen '' . 
  [ there 's also a monument dedicated to some romanian fascists who died in majadahonda . 
  ] ( http://i2.wp.com/www.rostonline.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/monumentul-mota-marin-majadahonda.jpg ) the local authorities of majadahonda ( a suburb of madrid ) want to demolish it . 
   eastern bloc was under foreign occupation that was not the case everywhere : for instance , romania had soviet troops only until 1958 . 
  after that , the romanian government was pretty much independent from the soviet union . 
  actually , i have only green and brown , my brother has blue ( mostly ) , green and brown . 
  but [ is this light or dark ?

   could someone from sweden share with us , whether it 's really that bad ? 
  i lived for a bit more than two months last year in stockholm . 
  * it seems to be safer than most of europe * it 's definitely cleaner and public services are better run than the european average ( average which is brought down by eastern and southern europe ) * people ( regardless of social class ) are far more prosperous than in eastern and southern europe . 
  not everything is perfect . 
  i noticed there 's a lot of racial segregation based on income : the native swedes are generally more educated and wealthier than the immigrants , which allows them to live in better ( and more expensive ) neighbourhoods than the people of immigrant background . 
  housing costs are a big issue in stockholm for everyone and all governments for the last few decades have been inefficient in solving it . 
  ( during the 1960s-70s , the social-democratic government solved the housing problems by building millions of apartments -- now it seems the new social-democrats think they can solve it without building )  there were a lot of beggars in the streets virtually all beggars in stockholm are from romania and bulgaria . 
  they 're not refugees . 
  carbon monoxide is less of a worry outside in the open air because it spontaneously turns into co2 given enough oxygen . 
  it is indeed a health worry indoors , for instance in badly-ventilated underground parkings . 
  also , apart from nox and unburnt hydrocarbons , a big issue ( probably the biggest ) is the particulate matter ( pm ) , which is huge for diesel engines . 
   accusing fiat chrysler automobiles ' 500x compact sport-utility vehicle of releasing excessive levels of toxic diesel emissions . 
  applying the emissions standards for diesel engines ( which are already much more lenient than for gas engines ) would basically mean banning them , which is probably the best thing at this time . 
  most of europe 's cities are very polluted and diesel engines are the worst offender . 
   we are permanently based in russia and china without major problems , but are not allowed to stay in nato-member turkey . 
  in the [ 2015 press freedom index ] ( https://index.rsf.org/ ) , turkey was # 149 , just above russia 's # 152 and having a worse situation than zimbabwe ( # 131 ) and afghanistan ( # 122 ) . 
  hillary is the only `` hawk '' among the top candidates . 
  should would probably be more aggressive than obama , but less aggressive than gw bush . 
  bernie is not going to enter any war that he can avoid . 
  cruz is softer than the average republican and trump thinks like a businessman : if there are no immediate tangible profits , he 's not going to do it . 
  they are right that northern europe 's food is terrible . 
  if only we could create a hybrid between northern european work ethics and social cohesion and southern european food and lifestyle ... 
  the falklands are indeed * geographically * in europe . 
   the sources of the imported energy ( i assume mostly russian and norway ? ), 
  also saudi arabia , libya and irak ( oil ) or australia and south africa ( coal ) . 
  the same way romanian state was originally founded by cumans , even though they never were more than a tiny minority of the population . 
  actually , some hungarians support it because the new constitution would have to allow autonomous regions , making the szekely autonomous region a possibility . 
  moldova has two such autonomous regions : transnistria and gagauzia and it 's almost certainly that the new state would have to accept them as such . 
  yet another reason why we need some federal-level institutions ... 
  similar `` war crimes '' courts for fascists and collaborators were found in western countries as well . 
  i 'd argue that france 's record of post-war justice was far worse than what we had in the east . 
  afterall , a biased trial is still better than the mob justice they had in france . 
   immediately following the liberation , france was swept by a wave of executions , public humiliations , assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators , known as the \u00e9puration sauvage ( savage purge ) . 
  [ 2 ] this period succeeded the german occupational administration but preceded the authority of the french provisional government , and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice . 
  [ 2 ] approximately 9,000 were executed , mostly without trial . 
    [ ... ]   from 1944 to 1951 , official courts in france sentenced 6,763 people to death ( 3,910 in absentia ) for treason and other offenses . 
  only 791 executions were actually carried out . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9puration_l\u00e9gale ), 
  the real solution to rising rent is to build more public housing . 
  rent control wo n't work because there is a demand that has to be met . 
   you 'll definitely see a tit or two at any mediterranean beach . 
  ... or a bunch of naked germans on some beaches . 
   they do not believe that a viable palestinian state is feasible a viable palestinian state is not feasible * because * the israelis did everything in their power to prevent it . 
  settlements are there in order to prevent the creation of a viable palestinian state . 
  during the early '90s , poland was poorer than hungary . 
  if we define europe = european union . 
  some ex-ussr countries , including russia , ukraine and moldova are heavier drinkers . 
  i 'm preparing a tin-foil hat for me . 
  do you want one as well ? 
   for example it clearly states that constitutional reform ( point 11 ) is a condition for the border control ( point 9 )  that 's the sequence . 
  a few of the archaic names are actually using folk etymology over the latin name . 
  * gerar < * genar ( cf italian gennaro ) < latin januarius * f\u0103urar < latin februarius * prier < * aprire ( with rhotacism of intervowel `` l '' ) < latin aprilis * gustar < latin augustus , with - ar to be like the other months also , the last one has a latin origin : * undrea < * \u00cendrea < latin andreas ( the saint 's day is right before it starts ), 
  but the list specifically indicates a sequence of implementation . 
  [ see the whole list in wikipedia . 
  it would be a great idea if we had a similar standard of living in all countries . 
  look at japan , south korea , singapore , taiwan , etc : there are almost no japanese or koreans wanting to migrate to europe because their standard of living is similar . 
   since then have reemeraged they 're like those old rock bands who get back together for one more concert . 
  simple : they did n't include finland in the survey . 
  probably because it 's not a very popular with `` expats '' ( aka educated immigrants from western countries ) . 
  18 % in governmental vaults , 16 % as investment ( practically , in private vaults ) , 52 % in jewellery ( much of it also as investment ) 12 % actually used for something useful . 
  the majority of gold mined is not used in the industry , but rather it is put in the vaults of banks . 
  we had a very strong civil society movement against this . 
  dozens of protests in bucharest , sometimes involving tens of thousands of people . 
  we had weekly protest marches ( and sometimes more often ) , walking through the city . 
  i personally walked all-in-all over 100 km in those marches . 
   the government understood that if they 're going to lose if they continue the mining project , so they backed down . 
  even more important was that the politicians now know that they ca n't do something against which the public opinion has a strong opinion .
