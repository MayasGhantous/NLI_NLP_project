   `` the lanugage is a dialect with an army and navy . '', 
  of course , but the moldovans use ( and used during the soviet era ) the same standard language as romanians , not a different standard based on the local dialects . 
  standard romanian is based on the dialect found in the area between bucharest and bra\u0219ov . 
  the vernaculars are , as expected , different . 
  if you are a refugee and you live for years in a refugee camp , where you ca n't work , you ca n't evolve personally , your children do n't get proper education , etc. 
  many , but not the majority , are economic migrants :  while the majority of arrivals to greece are from syria and afghanistan , there are also many palestinians ( who had been living in syria ) , pakistanis , algerians , moroccans , yemenis and smaller numbers of sudanese , somalis , cameroonians , nigerians , sri lankans and bangladeshis . 
  also , this is interesting :  the vast majority of afghan arrivals are from the ethnic hazara minority that have long faced persecution in afghanistan, 
  in bucharest , the average monthly salary ( after tax ) is around 3000 ron ( 661 euros ) , so a bit less than half . 
  edit : actually , it 's 2813 ron ( 620 euro ) , so around half . 
  my wife is a lecturer at the university here and she makes 1400 ron ( about 308 euros ) after tax . 
  school teachers make even less ... 
  the capital was moved to constantinople by constantine in the 4th century . 
  eggs ? 
  not rocks ? 
  there 's still hope for the balkans !, 
  from what i understand , rape is rarely about sexual gratification , it 's usually about power . 
  the rapists want to dominate the victim and they feel they are entitled to do it . 
  this is why male rapists tend to be from cultural environments where women are mistreated . 
  also , you 're talking about etatism , but you probably do n't know that in both singapore and hong kong , the state owns ** all ** the land and , as such , the real estate development is centrally planned . 
  this means that in singapore , [ more than 80 % of the residents live in public housing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_housing_in_singapore ) , built by the government . 
  that 's a level of etatism that is not found anywhere in the european union . 
  both hong kong and singapore have a privileged geographical position that allows them to be trade hubs . 
  [ they are the biggest transshipment ports : singapore is # 1 in the world , hong kong is # 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_world%27s_busiest_transshipment_ports ) . 
  much of east asia 's exports go through these two countries and a big part of the raw materials imports also go through them . 
  replicating these conditions on a large scale is not possible . 
  you could turn the netherlands into a similar hub , but there 's no way you could do the same for the whole eu . 
  what works for a 5 million country ( singapore ) does n't work for a 500 million entity ( the eu ) . 
  so we need to become more like africa , without any `` socialism '' ( public services , workers ' rights ) and `` etatism '' ( government planning ) ? 
  sounds great , why did n't we think about it before ? 
  chechens ' struggle is longer than last century . 
  tolstoy wrote about them in his novel hadji murat . 
  random fact : after the chechen wars ended , the russian government built [ a huge mosque in grozny ] ( http://airpano.ru/files/grozniy-russia/images/image1.jpg ) , which was named after akhmad kadyrov . 
  kadyrov was originally on the side of the separatists ( during the first chechen war ) , but then switched sides and he was assassinated by jihadis . 
  isis was founded in iraq , where the government was too weak to keep it in check following the chaos of the us invasion . 
  without isis , there would be no civil war in syria , as the rest of the forces would have been weak and destroyed by assad quite quickly . 
  or to overthrow the democratically-elected president . 
  and if you 're a swedish-speaking finn , finnish counts as a foreign language . 
   then that implies that the us civil war was actually a war of aggression against the confederacy . 
  the southern us were definitely not a `` nation '' . 
  they shared ethnicity , language , traditions , etc. 
  with the northern americans . 
  the conflict was based on purely economic and social reasons , the most important being slavery . 
  it was more a conflict between classes within the same nation . 
  on the other hand , catalans are definitely a nation having a different ethnicity , different language , different traditions , different culture from the spaniards . 
   when referendums for secession are organized they usually require the consent of the larger state or otherwise result in violence . 
  yes , which is why consent is the preferred way , in order to avoid violence . 
  podemos does n't support catalan independence , it supports democracy . 
  and part of that democracy is that any nation ( including the catalans ) should have the right to become independent , if they want it . 
   is n't -30 \u00ba medically dangerous ? 
  if you go around naked , yes . 
  wan na bet that millions of ukrainians would settle illegally in the eu within a couple of years ? 
   the minimum wage in ukraine is 60 $ / month . 
  an illegal immigrant gets 500-1000 $ / month in western europe . 
  if i were a ukrainian minimum-wage worker and i had the chance to move to western europe , i would n't think twice . 
   you people seems to be not aware what visa-free access means . 
  it does not mean joining schengen theoretically , yes . 
  practically , when romanians were given visa-free access to the eu , within a few years , millions of romanians moved to western europe to work illegally ( especially in agriculture and construction ) . 
  since we now joined the eu , now they 're working legally , but most of them settled illegally . 
  ukraine is in a much worse situation ( both economically and politically ) than romania ever was and it has a larger population . 
  i would expect 5 million ukrainians settling in the eu within 5 years . 
  many of the `` turks '' living in germany are actually kurds from turkey . 
  russia did have its fair share of genocides in siberia , but there were very few people inhabiting those lands in the first place . 
  also , like in the americas , the europeans brought diseases ( particularly smallpox ) which killed a lot of the population . 
  this is an alternative to visa/mastercard . 
  you do n't entrust your money to visa or mastercard , it 's the banks that have your money , visa/mastercard are only intermediaries . 
   it would be apparent that you receive a lot of money . 
  i doubt most weed dealers receive that much money . 
  how can you tell apart weed dealers from flea market or other itinerant salesmen ? 
  ... which actually gets paid by the greek government . 
  they have mismanaged resources ( due to corruption , incompetent leadership , etc. 
  ) , but that 's another thing . 
  they have a lot of potential . 
  russia has an educated workforce , some industry and plenty of other resources . 
  saudi arabia has none of that , they have oil and nothing else . 
  in romania , these neofascists are not very popular . 
  the only time anyone hears about them is once a year , when they protest against homosexuality during the same day as the gay pride march in bucharest . 
  [ and some more in the \u00c5rsta district of stockholm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nauarf5.jpg ) . 
  the older `` soviet '' - style blocks of stockholm have plenty of greenery surrounding them . 
  i feel the newly built ones are surrounded by too much concrete . 
  if you 're assuming that there was no widespread corruption in the us during the great depression , you 're wrong . 
  the chicago gangsters and sicilian mafia of new york city of the 1930s would n't have prospered without local political corruption . 
  eastern european countries were poor before 1945 , too . 
  widespread corruption exists in ** all ** poor countries , across all the continents . 
  without a single exception . 
  from brazil to ethiopia to philippines . 
  corruption was not created by the russians , communism or anything else . 
  it 's just a nocive culture born out of poverty . 
  it can only be fixed by first becoming richer , not the other way around . 
  reporting how things actually are in ukraine is russophilia ? 
  do n't assume that . 
  ethnic ukrainians are culturally not very different from russians . 
  i was surprised to see that we were richer than spain in 1938 . 
  then i remembered why : the spanish civil war . 
  that 's harsh . 
  a more fair comparison would be in ppp , because if you convert a dollar in roubles , you can buy a lot more in russia today than you did 3 years ago . 
  podemos went from 0 seats in the last elections ( they were not founded yet ) to 65 seats and 20,7 % of the votes , so i guess they were the big winner . 
  just like the gays themselves caught gay from their heterosexual parents !, 
  things such as the free trade treaty allowing ukraine to export to the russian market ? 
   calling it a default is pretty misleading . 
  it 's not misleading , it is a default , according to its definition ( from wikipedia , you can find more in-depth definitions at international financial organizations , but this is the basic one ) :  a national or sovereign default is the ** failure or refusal ** of a government ** to repay ** its national debt .
