  just because he 's trolling , it does n't mean he has mental issues . 
  if you look from his point-of-view , most of putin 's decisions did work : * he obtained crimea without a bullet fired . 
  * he stopped ukraine 's attempt to join nato . 
  * he stopped the syrian opposition ( whatever it is ) from removing his ally assad ( who lends the russians a port in the mediterranean ) and he did this while getting the support of huge numbers of russians . 
  there is a department for organized crime and terrorism that usually get to do the cross-border crime , but that 's a different thing from a real national-level police . 
  yes , but the difference in standards of living from $ 100 to $ 500 is far bigger than between $ 400 and $ 800 . 
  there is no national-level police , there 's just town-level police ( which is basically powerless ) and county-level police . 
  there are some national anti-corruption institutions , but they 're generally overwhelmed by the number of cases and generally pick up only the bigger cases . 
  no , romania did n't improve much , especially if we compare it with poland , which started in 1990 roughly at the same level as romania and now it 's miles ahead ; the story here is that hungary improved so little . 
  catch up effect does n't work every time . 
  for instance , the difference between romania and ukraine increased since 2000 ( even before the civil war ) . 
  anti-corruption helps economically , even if it makes the country politically weaker . 
  romania is growing faster than hungary , it 's getting close to catch it up . 
  this is true for gdp , but that 's often not a good measure , so i use the average wage . 
  average gross wage ( monthly ) : * 2000 : romania : 2.2 m rol = $ 118 * 2000 : hungary : 104k huf = $ 444 hungary = 3.76 x romania * 2014 : romania : 2298 ron = $ 557 * 2014 : hungary : 257k huf = $ 887 hungary = 1.59 x romania, 
  in rural areas , having municipal landfills ( which was a mandatory requirement from the eu ) is an improvement over having no garbage collection at all . 
  previously , each village had a few places at the outskirts of the village where they dumped the refuse without any supervision or checkup . 
  or worse , in some places people just threw them in the river . 
   but food waste is already used currently . 
  in many parts of europe ( particularly in the east and south ) , food waste is landfilled . 
  there have been countless cases of drug trafficking , rape and sexual abuse and even slavery and murder among the saudi princes in western europe and the us . 
  almost always they get out without spending a day in prison . 
  they should do like everyone else is doing : bring spies under the pretext of being low-key embassy clerks . 
  al-cohol is an arabic word , afterall . 
   most cows i 've seen irl look far taller , maybe i 'm just imagining it . 
  most cows nowadays belong to high-productivity breeds , which are bigger and yield far more milk than the traditional breeds . 
  actually , central budapest was not affected by `` communism '' . 
  fishing can be done in the danube . 
  2050 = our children will do it , we can just ignore it for the next 30 years . 
  what 's silly is that the people who are the most pro-europe politicians do everything they can to prevent europe from becoming a federation . 
  at least the fn is honest about their intentions . 
  i 'm pretty sure your hospitals [ do n't look like this ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2014/12/10/54880011448e03c0fd9f3c51/646x404.jpg ) [ satu mare hospital ] or [ this unkept ] ( http://media2k.rtv.net/image/201405/w400h400/spital_tecuci_12065200.jpg ) [ tecuci hospital ] or [ this crowded ] ( http://www.evz.ro/image-original-605-388/cache/2015-01/foto-spital-4-465x390.jpg ) or [ look like an abandoned building ] ( http://media.rtv.net/image/201402/w400h400/spital_iasi4_14109100.png ) [ ia\u0219i children 's hospital ] . 
  ( i 've seen worse pics posted by a doctor on facebook , but this is what i can find now on google ) you can find sights like that across the country . 
  most of these hospitals have n't been renovated since the ceau\u0219escu era ( the 1980s ) . 
  that 's because china exports low-value energy-intensive products . 
  europe and the us tend to avoid producing those because they are quite polluting as well . 
  china is making all the stuff we use , of course they release all this co2 . 
  the ukrainian government just raised the minimum wage to 55 $ / month ( 1378 uah ) . 
  that 's at the level of the third-world wages . 
  the bangladeshi who sew your shirt get a minimum wage of [ 62 $ / month ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-13/bangladesh-garment-factories-to-stay-shut-amid-worker-protests ) . 
  10 % for killing people ( military ) and keeping the political establishment in place ( police ) ? 
  quite low . 
  in romania , about 14 % of my taxes go to that ( military , police , secret services etc ) . 
  estimated number of bulgarian isis recruits : 0-1 i guess there 's a guy who said on the facebook event that he 's coming , but it 's pretty clear he wo n't come . 
  so 2016 is not going to be the year of greek recovery , either . 
  [ from the schengen agreement brochure  ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf )  the schengen area is encircled by 42673 km of sea borders and 7721 km of land borders . 
  you wanted to get your flight canceled ? 
  the wall did n't affect illegal immigration . 
  mexicans who wanted to reach the us did reach it , more than 12 million of them , a tenth of mexico 's population . 
  fences work !, 
  the us has [ a fence at the border with mexico ] ( http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/files/2009/01/l108727-100.jpg ) and there are absolutely no illegal mexican immigrants in the us . 
  we can call this area `` the slanina belt '' . 
  china is also a product of the cold war , but that does n't mean that nato is n't . 
   turkey has been bombing isis it was just an unfortunate accident that made the bombs always fall on the kurds . 
  many of the poor do n't hold steady jobs and agricultural seasonal work is scarce during the winter . 
  across eastern europe , there are many poor people who ca n't get adequate nutrition and the eu food packages help them get over the winter . 
  unlike in western europe , our part of the world does n't have much welfare/social security from the state . 
  for instance , in romania , the welfare benefits are somewhere around 1 $ / person/day in exchange of several days of community service each month . 
  the reason is obviously that the economic and political elite do n't want the poor to get much from our taxes . 
  social protection ( including pensions , unemployment benefits , etc ) as percentage of gdp ( [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/4/48/expenditure_on_social_protection%2c_2002\u201312_%28%25_of_gdp%29_yb15.png ) ) : * denmark : 34,6 % * france : 34,1 % * italy : 30,3 % * germany : 29,9 % * uk : 28,8 % ... * czech republic : 20,8 % * poland : 18,8 % * slovakia : 18,4 % * bulgaria : 17,4 % * romania : 15,6 % * latvia : 14,0 %, 
  the ottoman empire is back ? 
  qatar was part of the ottoman empire until 1915 , when it became a british protectorate . 
   as we can see under saddam hussein and under assad actually , a worse outcome was in libya . 
  gaddafi was a detestable person ( even though in the last years , he was not serious about it , he was just trolling to keep his reputation ) , but he took serious the `` socialist '' part of his party and the people of libya had a very high standard of living , high life expectancy , etc. 
  now it 's a failed state . 
  as a random piece of trivia , the slovak word is derived from romanian `` fluier '' ( meaning both * flute * and * whistle * ) . 
  in the middle ages , romanian ( or , as they were called , wallachian or vlach ) shepherds settled in what is now slovakia , bringing their bryndza cheese , sheep dogs and the rest of their material culture and folklore . 
  similarly , they also reached what is now the czech republic , in the region called [ moravian wallachia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_wallachia ) . 
  eventually , they were assimilated by the slovakians and czechs , so now there are just some ethnographic peculiarities in the areas where they live . 
  well , i meant it in opposition to `` authoritarian capitalism '' ( like in russia ) , `` nationalist capitalist '' and the versions of capitalism like the one the koch brothers want ( oligarchy ) . 
  but it 's still a version of neoliberal capitalism that wants to weaken the governments . 
  yes , exactly this is what the saudis do when they spread extremism . 
  they spend their money spreading a way of thinking they honestly believe is morally best . 
  this is also what created isis . 
  should this be encouraged ? 
   he seems to hate capitalism i 'd say it 's the other way around : he does n't hate it . 
  he 's trying to impose his own model of liberal capitalism onto the rest of the world . 
  liberal capitalism ( think us democratic party ) is still capitalism , regardless of what the right-wing propaganda says . 
  there 's a huge difference between funding media and funding activists . 
  there 's a difference between criticizing the policies of another country and paying nationals of that country to do it . 
  do you think the us government would agree if i was using my hundreds of millions of dollars to fund communist activists in the us ? 
  soros is trying to use money to impose his own values onto the world . 
  many of his ideas are not bad , but you get the whole bundle , whether you like it or not . 
  together with anti-racism activism , you get his neoliberal ideas . 
  the result is that his foundations are undermining and subverting the social justice movements . 
  of course , putin 's reasoning is different : soros is using money from abroad to fund an opposition to his rule . 
   what ? 
  the eu invests plenty of money into eu transport infrastructure . 
  here in eastern europe we do n't feel it . 
  the average speed for passenger trains in romania is 40 km/h and a bucharest-budapest journey ( 800 km ) takes 14 hours ... 
  i heard similar complaints from poland , so the problem is not just here and in hungary . 
  more trade is a good thing . 
  it 's a shame that the eu is not investing in such infrastructure and we have to rely on foreign countries like china to build them . 
  why `` enemy '' ? 
  the gdp growth of sweden is higher than population growth , so the gdp/capita is growing as well . 
  the guys at / r/european must be upset that the collapse of sweden is n't happening yet . 
  did n't he say a few days ago that the plane was shot down on his order ? 
  some things are much more expensive , some are not . 
  * housing is much more expensive : 4-5x as much . 
  the beggars do n't rent apartments ( in the summer i 've seen them sleeping rough -- under bridges , etc.
