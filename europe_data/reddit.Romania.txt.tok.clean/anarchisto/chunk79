  i do n't know what they do in winter ) , so they 're not affected . 
  * services ( eating out , utilities , etc. ), 
  are more expensive : 2-3x times more . 
  * food ( from the supermarket ) is a bit more expensive : 1.5-2x times more . 
  alcohol and lack of employment opportunities . 
  educated people already left that city for bucharest . 
  a romanian beggar in stockholm earns around 4-500 $ / month . 
  at the same time , in romania : * a person that has no job and lives off social benefits gets around 30 $ / month . 
  * minimum wage is around 175 $ / month ( net ) . 
  * median wage is around 250 $ / month . 
  * average wage ( which is strongly skewed by high-wage earners ) is 380 $ / month . 
  huh ? 
  [ the data is from world bank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd ) . 
  russians do n't support putin because they live well , but rather because they live much better than they did during yeltsin . 
  gdp per capita ( ppp ) : * 1998 ( before putin ) : russia = $ 5,460 ; germany = $ 24,846 -- 4.55 x * 2014 : russia = $ 25,635 ; germany = $ 45,615 -- 1.78 x, 
   the fact that there is no rioting inside crimea makes me wonder that 's not surprising : crimean russians ( who make the majority ) do n't consider themselves ukrainian . 
  they 're russian ethnically and linguistically , so there 's no reason they 'd oppose the annexation . 
  arabs ? 
   the word rak\u0131 is derived from the arabic \u0639\u0631\u0642 [ \u0295araq ] , [ 3 ] meaning distilled , other variants being araka , araki , ariki . 
  [ 4 ] araq means perspiration in arabic, 
  former french colony , there are still a lot of french business and strategical interests in the country . 
  when the tuaregs wanted to secede from mali , the french government supported the government of their protectorate ... tldr : lingering french colonialism . 
  that region is held by turkmen militias which are affiliated to al-nusra . 
  you have to take in consideration that jets fly at 1000-1300 km/h , so it 's common for planes to violate the airspace of neighbours . 
  it happens everywhere . 
  even on the soviet/russian-us border in alaska . 
  when you 're flying at 1000 km/h , it 's easy to get a couple of km across the border . 
  but of course , redditors are experts on everything , including aviation . 
  this is actually a good question : that small space is 4 km wide . 
  wikipedia says that f16 is optimized to fight at 0.6-1 .6 mach ( 735-1960 km/h ) . 
  at that speed , 4 km would be flown in 10-20 seconds , not enough to do everything within that space . 
   not a difficult task when you 're flying in border regions , it is hard , especially if you 're flying at very high speeds and you have a very irregular border . 
  i 've seen the claim that it had been for 17 seconds over turkey . 
  no , we 're not talking just about relative poverty . 
  in romania we have absolute poverty , third-world poverty . 
  children growing without adequate food ( child malnutrition is very high in romania ) , in houses that are cold during the winter . 
  houses that are [ made out of mud ] ( http://codlea.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dsc_0009-copy.jpg ) , without access to safe water ( we 're the only country in the eu where this is an issue ) , without sewerage or a bathroom . 
  children whose parents ca n't afford access to healthcare , who ca n't afford sending them to high school ( yes , that 's an issue , particularly for children in isolated village , far away from any high school ) , let alone to university . 
  the problem is not the lack of resources , but distribution of those resources . 
  currently , the distribution is much more unequal than it was a few decades ago . 
   there is no isis presence in latakia region . 
  there 's an islamic front presence in latakia region . 
  their salafist ideology is pretty much the same as isis , they also want to establish an islamic state , implement sharia laws and kill infidels . 
  the only difference between them and isis is the tactics they use . 
   expect russia boycotting turkish goods before the syrian crisis , there were 5 million russian tourists visiting turkey every year . 
  the number has been dropping and after this , they 'll lose another 2 million russian tourists per year . 
  there 's a small part of the latakia region held by the saudi-funded and backed islamic front . 
  mind you , that 's still radical wahhabi islamism . 
  you mean the other islamist groups ? 
  there 's no `` moderate '' non-islamist opposition left . 
  that may have been at the beginning , but now it has been utterly destroyed . 
  there 's just al-qaeda in syria , islamic front ( supported by the saudis ) and the local groups of the muslim brotherhood . 
  in latakia there is a russian air base , it does n't mean they were bombing latakia , which is under assad 's control ... 
  i see now that isis has anti-aircraft defence . 
  the media had a very strong anti-corbyn campaign after he was elected , so this might affect his ratings . 
  after a while , the people would get used to the media 's behavior towards him and this should make him immune to media attacks . 
  he tried to cause panic among the people there . 
  yes , it 's illegal , similar to yelling `` fire ! '', 
  in a theatre . 
  he was fined for it . 
  it 's funny that the weapons we give to the `` moderate '' rebels invariably ends up in the hands of isis . 
  the equipment they have is mostly `` made in the usa '' . 
  isis has some support in jordan , lebanon and morocco , from which thousands of volunteers joined it . 
  then , there are other rich gulf states ( emirates , kuwait , bahrain ) where there might be groups supporting it with money . 
  in africa , boko haram is associated with isis , so there are a few more countries from which money could flow . 
  even though their governments might be against this , incompetence might prevent them from doing anything . 
  * qatar is the only * state * actually funding isis . 
  * saudi arabia funds `` radical imams '' who also do isis recruting and individual princes fund isis . 
  * turkey helps isis as a way to keep the kurds in check , but it 's mostly by allowing private companies in turkey to buy oil from isis . 
  sms is not encrypted end-to-end , the content is accessible to the network provider . 
  that weak ( and flawed ) encryption only exists between the tower and the cell phone to prevent third-parties from accessing them . 
  isis is not recognized by anyone . 
  international rules do n't allow stripping of citizenship if that makes a person stateless . 
  it 's not necesarily because they want : typically , the immigrants are poor and simply can not afford locals ' neighborhoods . 
  apparently the attackers used kalashnikovs , so it was not a regular lowlife gang member . 
  i do n't think the germans are willing to go into any kind of large-scale war . 
  the last two world wars left deep scars on the german psyche . 
  so , on what side will you be during the great american-chinese war of 2025 ? 
  yes , they did have a say . 
  let me quote from [ yad vashem - world center for holocaust research ] ( http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206633.pdf ) :  in february 1943 the bulgarians ** signed a pact with germany ** , in which they ** agreed to deport ** to the east 20,000 jews from their territories . 
  since nowhere near 20,000 jews lived in the newly annexed territories of macedonia and thrace combined , the bulgarian authorities intended to include jews from bulgaria itself in the deportations . 
    in march 1943 almost all of the jews in bulgarian-occupied thrace ( some 4,000 ) were arrested and surrendered to the germans , who then deported them to their deaths at treblinka . 
  another group of about 1,200 thrace jews was moved to salonika and then sent to auschwitz . 
  at the same time , all of the jews of macedonia were ** rounded up by the bulgarian authorities ** ; all but 165 were deported to treblinka . 
   save its jewish population as bulgaria did i thought the bulgarian authorities shipped the jews in macedonia to auschwitz . 
  two words : solar energy . 
  they have enough land to produce ten times all energy that humanity currently uses . 
   last year , 112,070 people declared themselves homeless in england -- a 26 % increase in four years . 
  at the same time , the number of people sleeping rough in london grew by 75 % to a staggering 6,437 . 
  why ? 
  a # 7bn cut in housing benefit , welfare reforms and a huge lack of affordable housing . 
  [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/25/homelessness-crisis-england-perfect-storm ) . 
  very generous , indeed . 
  without subsidized or government-paid healthcare and education , most people simply would not afford it . 
  without welfare payments , a substantial part of the population would reach third-world poverty levels and , in countries where there are many people who rent rather than own their houses , homelessness ( and crime associated with it ) would become a serious problem . 
  the rich would start living in `` gated communities '' surrounded by tall walls and having armed guards , just like the have in south america . 
  if you split your country , maybe bruxelles becomes federal district within the future european federation . 
   no , but a lot of other eu countries can cut it 's taxes and reduce it 's social welfare programs . 
  without social welfare programs , european countries will turn into what we see in the third-world countries : pockets of immense wealth in a sea of poverty . 
  switzerland is an exceptional case as the offshore banking capital of the world .
