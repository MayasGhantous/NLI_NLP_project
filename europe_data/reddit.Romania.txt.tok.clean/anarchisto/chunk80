  not every small country can attract trillions in offshore wealth . 
  so does rakija . 
   this wouldnt be possible in germany , school here is mandatory . 
  so is in romania . 
  but our local authorities are too lazy to do anything , including applying the law . 
  the romanian government 's affirmative action programs are useless . 
  they do n't need affirmative actions , which assume they 're dumber than the rest of us ( they can get into university with lower grades ) . 
  they need education expenses paid by the state ( they can not afford the school books , or living in the city for university study ) and social programs that are actually working . 
  a national program for school meals would work a hundred times more than all the programs currently in place . 
  the parents would send their children to school just for those meals . 
  can the museum of the french revolution lend us a guillotine ? 
  sanctions are among the last measures . 
  they use them only for countries where it 's not possible to do anything else . 
  they start like this : * use their secret services to dig up dirt about the leaders of the ruling party . 
  corruption , sexual misconduct , misuse of power , etc. 
  use the dirt as blackmail and , if they do n't budge , leak them to the press to help decrease their popularity . 
  * use their financial leverage to increase the government debt interest rates of the country . 
  this can have a dramatic effect on the economy in the long term . 
  * use the control of the media against the government ( it works especially if most of the media is foreign-owned ) * find dirty things done by companies from that country . 
  virtually every big corporation is corrupt to the bone , so that should not be hard to do . 
  * finance an `` orange '' revolution against the political class through ngos ( this works in less developed countries where the class is out of touch with the common people ), 
  they do n't even have land borders !, 
  all of them are corrupt . 
  some of them claim to fight corruption . 
  i do n't find this suprising . 
  there was a strong opposition to ponta within the social-democratic party . 
  yesterday 's protests gave the opposition forces within the party the power to bring him down . 
  the only country in the world having a press less free than north korea !, 
  * bucharest : 13-23 ron ( 3-5 $ ) -- soup , main dish and dessert * stockholm : 80-100 sek ( 9-11 $ ) -- usually includes a main dish ( often in a buffet style ) , a salad bar and drinks ( including coffee ) . 
  most of those who died on the spot died of monoxide poisoning . 
  the people who are in hospital in a critical state have burns . 
  alcohol has a big influence as well , also in the life expectancy . 
  joining the eu wo n't help you cut down the rakija intake . 
   also , there 's the '' % population with raised total cholesterol '' part of the index . 
  pork is part of our balkanian way of life !, 
   they used to be ok they are still ok . 
  the young tatars i know are just as non-religious as the people of christian heritage . 
  the problem is that many of them get the jobs as compensation for decisions taken during their time as commissioners . 
  how about the people between 55-64 , who can not yet retire , yet , they 're systematically discriminated and can not find employment ? 
  dr\u0103culea is the best dracula !, 
  thank god for bulgaria . 
  without them , we 'd be last . 
   the saudi ambassador to the u.k. threatened in an op-ed that any further criticism of the riyadh regime by jeremy corbyn could jeopardize the multi-layered u.k. / saudi alliance now that would be a great loss !, 
  apparently , the meal was [ together with his 23-year old assistant ] ( http://www.kmkz.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/consiliera-oprea-2.jpg ) . 
  the hole was dug by gdf suez ( the gas company ) . 
  they are obviously guilty as well , however : * oprea abused his power by demanding police to give him a motorcade . 
  he did n't have legally this right . 
  * oprea was going to a restaurant , not to some meeting , again abusing his privileges as minister . 
  * the motorcade was going at 100 km/h in heavy rain . 
  * the police motorcycle were not supposed to be used in such conditions ( cold , rain , at night ) . 
  the claims that the motorcyclist policeman had a right to refuse the order are absurd . 
  i suppose the communist party is pandering for votes from the older people who miss the good ol' soviet union days and who are more likely to be homophobic . 
   two members of the communist party introduced the bill as a way to regulate russian morality the communist party is part of the opposition , so as long as they do n't have putin 's party support , it wo n't become a law . 
  that 's a fair conclusion : the snipers located on top of some buildings shooting at random into the crowd typically create the stress that made the people with gun shoot at each other . 
  during the revolution there was exactly * one * side : everyone ( the army , the police , the secret services , the people 's self-organized militias , etc. ), 
  was against ceau\u0219escu and yet there were 2000 dead people . 
  many of these people indeed were killed by `` friendly fire '' , but there would be no fire unless someone was firing back . 
  this is the military tribunal . 
  while the civil justice system has been improving , i have no illusions about the military : it is just as corrupt as it has always been . 
   the culture that emerged through centuries of immigration ? 
  the british , irish , chinese , indian , philippino , italian , malay , german , greek , sri lankan , korean , lebanese , dutch , fijian , iraqi , japanese , polish , iranian , pakistanese , maltese , turkish , french , afghan , cambodian , zimbabwean , nepalese mix that makes up australians is not a uniform culture ? 
  nothing happened to the miners . 
  they went back , the mines were soon closed down and their towns became poor , the unemployed people left to work in western europe . 
   basically through misinformation they got soldiers , police ( militia ) , revolutionaries to shoot one another . 
  misinformation and propaganda had a huge role at keeping terror , indeed , but there was * someone * to shoot first . 
  there were snipers ( almost certainly unafiliated with either the army , militia or the securitate ) on top of some buildings in bucharest who were shooting at random to create panic and make the soldiers and revolutionaries to shoot at each other . 
  most likely they were affiliated with kgb , as the soviet union wanted iliescu as president , but i would n't be suprised if there was some support from the cia . 
   imagine something resembling paramilitary troops , not friendly miners . 
  many people die or are injured by the miners . 
  the miners were organized and directed by agents of the romanian intelligence service ( sri ) , the secret service which was a reorganized version of securitate . 
  sri basically kept all the staff of the infamous securitate , just changed its allegience towards ion iliescu and his party . 
  the securitate agents were dressed as miners , but unlike the other miners , they had brand new and clean uniforms and hard hats . 
  they directed the miners towards the protesters in university square , towards the headquarters of the opposition parties and towards the offices of independent press outlets . 
  there was no way that a group of random miners would know where to find all these . 
  the head of sri at the time , virgil m\u0103gureanu , was later charged with genocide , but his charges were later dismissed . 
  when asked today whether he 's also charged with crimes against humanity , he responded that it 's `` a stupid question '' . 
  for the same reasons millions of romanians , bulgarians and poles move to western europe as well : they want a better life . 
  unlike the romanians , bulgarians and poles , they 're not legally allowed to work , so they try any possible way to stay . 
  if you 're a parent with a child and you 're in a crowd , you want to be able to see him/her at all times , so you would n't lose him/her . 
  people who hated each other for thousands of years now , but now are trying to get along . 
  these are not very rare genetic patterns . 
  the roma are of mixed indian and european ancestry . 
  do n't worry , comrade , it 's not like i 'll send you to / r/gulag . 
   this is not unpopular , it 's just ignorant . 
  an ad-hominem always helps win an argument . 
   the reason for which they are exploited by private companies is because they have the resources to do it . 
  the private companies have the resources because they borrow . 
  there is absolutely no reason why a state-owned companies could do the same thing . 
   in romania , the royalties level reflects , amongst others , that most onshore gas and oil fields are mature , largely depleted , yield poor results and require additional investments for exploitation . 
  omv ( the austrian oil company ) got around 10 billion $ in profits in romania since the privatization of petrom and that 's after the `` big investments '' . 
   the ottomans werent this tacky definitely . 
  [ ottoman interiors were n't that bad .

  ** taking up to the romanian government : ** we have an extremely corrupt government and a relatively fair anti-corruption prosecutors . 
  if anyone from the government does something against what western corporations want , foreign secret services pass up some information to the prosecutors ( who do their job ) and the politician will go to prison . 
  this is why no politician will risk to do anything that would make angry a foreign corporation . 
  our prime-minister even talks of * reducing * royalties for off-shore gas and oil extraction to 1 % ( he went to texas to talk to big players in the oil industry about this ) and setting them in stone for 20-30 years , so that a potential future non-corrupt government would n't be able to change them . 
  his fragile seat means he did not yet try to push these changes , but it 's just a matter of time . 
  ** start a campaign : ** we can start protests , but unless there 's a mass movement ( i mean tens of thousands protesting for months ) , it 's not going to do anything . 
  the authorities will harass the leaders by giving them huge fines for `` illegal protest '' , fines which typically get thrown out by a judge after a couple of years of trials ( if you have a few dozen fines , going to each trial is going to take a lot of your time ) .
