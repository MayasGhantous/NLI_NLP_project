  `` illegal protest '' means a protest that is not authorized by the local authorities . 
  the authorities either do n't respond in time to the requests for authorization or they give authorization for a different place ( typically somewhere in the outskirts of the city ) . 
  ** gather attention : ** the press is not very free . 
  i mean , most of the media is funded by a party or another and they 're not going to do anything that is not in their interest . 
  journalists complain all the time about not being allowed to publish investigations . 
  ** gather votes : ** as of today , there is no active party that is not part of the system . 
  a few months ago , they started allowing the creation of parties following a supreme court case put by the pirate party , so theoretically we could now start a party . 
  the domestic secret services ' ( which are under the control of the big parties ) main purpose is preventing such a movement from happening . 
  the domestic secret service is a funny thing : they have a higher budget than the equivalent of france and germany , even though we have a small population and we 're poor . 
  what 's sad is that people do n't believe change is possible , not even the politically-active ones . 
  i have been part of ( not officially registered ) independent political movements and the mood is not different from what was when ceau\u0219escu was in power , that the establishment can not be changed . 
  this may be the case in many first-world countries , but in poorer countries , the profits go to corrupt politicians and foreign corporations that bribe them . 
  i 'm not talking only about congo and nigeria ( both very rich in resources , but plundered by this unholy alliance of politicians and corporations ) , this is the case in europe as well . 
  in romania , the royalties paid by companies extracting resources ( including oil and gas ) are only 4-5 % of the value , with all taxes reaching perhaps 20 % . 
  in norway , oil extraction companies pay 80 % of the profits to the state . 
  there was no real democratic control in the ussr . 
  also , the biggest economic problem of the ussr was that they disallowed individual initiative . 
  i 'm a strong supporter of that . 
  in every country , all natural resources should be under public ownership , not to be exploited by for-profit companies and the resulting profits under direct democratic control . 
  we 're not xenophobic , we just happen to fear foreigners !, 
  romania is doing great on punishing corruption , but the corruption in politics is just as high . 
  i do n't understand why a politician whose friends , fellow party members and advisors get arrested for corruption would still go , in the middle of the night , to receive a bribe in cash . 
  ( i 'm talking about the mayor of bucharest ), 
  portugal ? 
  [ they have the lowest literacy rate in europe .

   if not againt the rules , post a photo without a flair or from throwaway and others will guess country . 
  with a few exception of people who look streotypical , i guess it 's quite difficult to say from which country is one from . 
  there was one such thread in a forum and i posted a pic and people said germany , netherlands or serbia . 
  people having some recent ancestors from other countries make it even harder . 
  my wife is romanian , but with some hungarian , czech , polish , greek and bulgarian ancestry -- that 's even harder to pinpoint . 
  of course , no one believed the ideology of the party . 
  even if you were left-wing , it was hard to agree with the stupidities of the official ideology . 
  but publicly , everyone who wanted to rise through any hierarchy supported it . 
   his two children go to my cousins extremely expensive boarding school in switzerland called institut le rosey . 
  wikipedia says annual tuition is around chf 125,000 . 
  that makes 230,000 $ / year for his two kids . 
  that 's the salary of the prime minister of moldova for 33 years , or the salary of an average moldovan for 106 years . 
   taking a position of even minimal responsibility ( like teacher , doctor , foreman ) was possible only as a party member . 
  actually , you needed to be a party member only to be able to be a manager having more than 10 people in your subordination . 
  you could have been a teacher , a doctor or a foreman ( of a small team ) without being a party member . 
  an interesting tidbit : being a party member was a coveted thing by many intellectuals . 
  the party mandated that the percentage of each category of workers to be the same as the percentage in the economy . 
  many blue-collar workers did n't want to be members ( there was nothing in for them ) , but many intellectuals wanted to become part of a company ( or state institution ) middle-management , for which membership was mandatory . 
  so while the party recruiters had a hard time getting blue-collar workers inside the party , there was even some competition for intellectuals . 
  can we recycle the slurs used for sticking gypsies to use for refugees as well ? 
  look what he 's arguing for : * healthcare for everyone * decent minimum wage * maternity leave * paid holidays * tuition-free universities * investing in infrastructure * reforming campaign funding he 's totally crazy !, 
  also on the blue line , in some stations , there is moss growing on the walls . 
  no arguing = no make up sex and that 's straining the relationship . 
  italians argue , but they do n't divorce . 
  i 'd say it 's a combination between women 's economic independence and how reasonable are the men . 
  women have more independence in scandinavia , but i 'd say that in spain there are more divorces due to the macho culture . 
  for now , saudi arabia is only invading its neighbours : direct military invasion in yemen ( surprisingly little of the war is reported in the western press ) , funding and arming `` moderate '' islamist groups in neighbouring syria and iraq . 
  poland simply does n't care about what happens to the yemenites , they 're afraid of russia . 
  you know , there 's this myth that only the romanians/eastern europeans are at fault for corruption , that it 's not the case that the french/germans come here and fuel corruption . 
  reminds me the case of ericsson , in which the swedish manager of the romanian branch was involved in a corruption deal . 
  the swedish state started investigating and then ericsson hq accused the manager of bringing officials without their knowledge . 
  the manager said it 's not true , that this was a decision made at higher levels and that it would n't have been possible for him to do it without their knowledge . 
   the root of corruption in romania , greece et al. 
  does not lie in france , germany , as assumed . 
  many multinationals bring their own managers from back home . 
  for instance , the people in the management of this company ( who decided to pay the bribes ) are really french . 
  is poland catholic romania ? 
  estonia is not `` ukraine 2.0 '' . 
  it should be `` not nordic '' . 
  only parts were leaked . 
  * financial services -- helping people and companies not pay taxes . 
  * real estate -- rich people buy apartments to become residents for tax purposes . 
  ( hence the high rise buildings in monaco ) * gambling -- websites tend to be headquartered in microstates , again for tax avoidance purposes and perhaps due to fewer regulations . 
  i 'm pretty sure erdogan does n't even want it . 
  his dream is to make revive the ottoman empire , by having `` protectorates '' in former middle east possessions like syria . 
  joining the eu would prevent following this path : turkey would become a part of europe , thus diminishing its power and role in the middle east . 
  the government attempted a few times to privatize everything , to implement something like an american-style medical system . 
  the problem is that due to poverty , 90 % of the population would not afford them . 
  we even had a government fall when they tried to privatize the emergency system . 
  in this particular case , eads deutschland gmbh was involved . 
  it can be transformed into a museum . 
  racial hygiene ? 
  oil , energy prices , lower vat , cheaper chinese industrial products . 
  it 's funny that the grenades in sweden are also of yugoslav origin . 
  it seems the bosnian and other yugoslav refugees brought them to sweden back in the 1990s . 
  their government inherited the russian/soviet imperialism and arrogance and that does n't make them popular with their neighbours . 
  at least russia / the soviet union could give something in return ( economic deals , etc. 
  ) , but ukraine has arrogance without anything to give back . 
  their government never acted in a friendly way or at least show some good faith towards romania . 
  even hungary ( which is the traditional enemy of romania ) , despite its recent orban-style stupidities , still is nicer . 
  on every dispute , ukraine refused to negociate and wanted things to be done their way : * the dispute regarding the serpent island maritimal boundery eventually went to an international trial * they refused to discuss about their canal at their edge of the danube delta ( which affected waterways and nature on the romanian side ) * the romanian minority in ukraine is not particularly well-treated . 
  ( the smaller minority in hungary has great minority rights , but that 's because they want the romanians to treat well the larger hungarian minority in romania ) etc. 
  of course , people are the same everywhere , so i do n't think there 's a big difference between the people of romania and those of bulgaria , or of ukraine , etc. 
  i 'm talking only about the governments . 
  country : romania favourite neighbour : moldova ( or bulgaria , if you exclude moldova ) least favourite neighbour : ukraine, 
  in some cities , the government 's troops and fsa and have a ceasefire and jointly fight isis . 
  i remember i read somewhere the context : it was that this is in eastern germany during the 1990 electoral campaign , the first after the union . 
  a few months later , the fishermen in the photo were laid off , joining the ranks of the unemployed ossis . 
   not true , there 's no big push to reforestate iceland my information is from the [ icelandic forestry service website ] ( http://www.skogur.is/english/forestry-in-a-treeless-land/ ) . 
  ( in english ! ), 
   it 's a lot more beautiful like this and this . 
  those two particular places ca n't even hold trees ( shallow or no soil ) . 
  only a quarter of iceland has the soil to support trees . 
  actually , originally , a quarter of iceland used to be covered by forests .
