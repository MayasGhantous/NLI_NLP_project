  ( before taxes ), 
  freedom house is definitely not a neutral institution ( you may even argue it 's even a puppet of the us government ) , but in this case many of their findings are not factually incorrect . 
  there is some increased political repression in russia . 
  pickpocketing . 
  i know that some of my countrymen are experts in doing this , but i know i 'm too clumsy to try such a thing . 
   wait , is n't the finnish embassy tacitly supporting criticism of an eu member 's internal politics ? 
  in eastern europe , all western embassies do that and it 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  * the scandinavians tell us we need more solidarity and social justice . 
  * the dutch tell us we should be nice to gays . 
  * the germans tell us to be less corrupt . 
  * the french tell us we need better infrastructure . 
  i read these books back when i was a kid . 
  anyway , i know there were plenty of movies based on it from outside the english-language countries : * [ a romanian/german/french tom sawyers mini-series filmed in the danube delta ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062607/?ref_=ttloc_loc_tt ) * [ a huckleberry finn movie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hopelessly_lost ) from the soviet union * [ a japanese anime based on huckleberry finn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huckleberry_no_bouken ), 
  in eastern europe , tom sawyer and huckleberry finn have always been very popular . 
   the repression ( which was necessary btw ) was conducted by the liberal government , not by the king . 
  yes , conducted by a liberal government which was appointed by the king specifically to repress the protests . 
   the official , recorded number of victims is 419/421 . 
  the 11000 number was put forward by your marxist colleague constantin mille and repeated ad nauseam by communist historiography . 
  and you . 
  the french government 's representatives at the time estimated the numbers between 10.000 and 20.000 . 
  i 'm sure they were marxists as well . 
  the western historians ' estimates tends to be around 10.000 . 
   carol i carol i was involved in the repression of the [ 1907 peasants ' revolt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_romanian_peasants'_revolt ) , during which the romanian army killed over 11,000 romanian peasants . 
  the army literally fired cannons on the peasants who revolted over the near-starvation conditions they had to endure due to the high rent they paid to the landowners , which formed the political elite of the country . 
  after the revolt ended , carol ordered that all the records related to the revolt to be destroyed so that no one will ever be found responsible for murdering the peasants . 
   there is n't enough office space then why the chart in the article says that the vacancy rate is 14 % ? 
  italy invaded greece , it was not able to defeat the greeks , germany had to intervene to finish up the business , leading to a delay in the start of the invasion of the soviet union . 
  in romania , all pubs are filled with smoke and almost all restaurants are , too . 
  it 's not uncommon to see people with 5-year old kids eating in a restaurant having a thick layer of smoke ... our government wo n't do anything by itself due to corruption . 
  i know it may be a joke , but this is not far from the truth . 
   the tough opposition of the greek people meant delaying the operation barbarossa , so that germany had to fight the soviets during the winter . 
  germany would have probably still lost if there was no greek opposition , but you guys probably prevented a few million allied ( soviet , british and american ) deaths . 
  i mean , you could make a referendum in both regions . 
  it 's obvious that the people of northern kosovo want to be part of serbia and the people of preshevo want to be part of kosovo . 
  the serbian government does n't even have to recognize kosovo for this , they could consider it as a change of borders of their kosovo province . 
    edit : dacic already tried that but usa and also kosovo officials rejected that edit : aye , it seems that the us is not willing to do this . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the kosovo people would want it . 
  why ca n't kosovo and serbia do a territory exchange ? 
  preshevo valley in exchange for northern kosovo ? 
  4th richest is the daughter of the general who ordered the army to fire on the protesters in timi\u0219oara early during the 1989 revolution , leading to the death of 73 people . 
  also , among the richest romanians there are a lot of people who were part of the securitate and the repression system before 1989 . 
  digi24 television is definitely not profitable . 
  it 's been subsidized by rcs/rds cable company ( owned by zolt\u00e1n tesz\u00e1ri ) since its beginning . 
  it is indeed neutral ( probably the only one in romania ) , but i do n't know why tesz\u00e1ri thinks it 's a good investment ( maybe to protect himself from government 's meddling into his affairs ) . 
  libertatea is a [ purveyor of soft-pornography more than a newspaper ] ( http://crissdinu.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/libertatea-penis.jpg ) . 
  it 's easy to be neutral when you have mostly articles on women with big tits and almost no articles on politics . 
  protv is similarly not much into politics , but rather their news are focusing on showbiz , socialites and , of course , crime . 
   this guy has never participated in politics , and is part of no party . 
   however , he does own some media : for instance , the * rom\u00e2nia liber\u0103 * newspaper , which always supported the `` right-wing '' ( b\u0103sescu 's parties ) . 
  no newspaper ( or any other kind of media ) is profitable in romania , they 're just subsidized by rich businessmen for political purposes . 
  forbes estimates his wealth at almost 900 million $ . 
  he owns many companies in insurance , construction , energy , real estate , hotels , retail , media , etc. 
  he was arrested for bribing some judges with 20,000 $ in order to get some favorable decisions in some bankruptcy cases . 
  in these cases , his strategy was to get some construction contracts , subcontract to some other companies , get the money out without paying the companies actually doing the work , claiming bankruptcy and then bribing judges to get some favorable decisions . 
  russia loves instability and lack of clarity . 
  they do n't want a final response of the eastern ukraine question . 
  they want this region to drag behind ukraine , just the way transnistria is dragging moldova behind . 
  the poor ethnic russians and ukrainians who do the fight and die for it are just in-between two powers . 
  i feel they are the victims in this game . 
   is a graffiti seriously news ? 
  racist graffiti is very common . 
  the news is that this time it 's * anti-white * racist graffiti . 
  but if you remove the freedoms , what remains of the western civlization ? 
   we barely know 50 non-latin words in common with albanian . . 
  there are at least 300-400 words in common . 
   there is n't enough evidence to back this . 
  that 's the linguistic consensus . 
  i have yet to read a linguistics article claiming that illyrian and thracian were the same language . 
   unless you believe in the conspirations stating that all the people in the balkans , except the greek , where part of the same nation in the antiquity . 
  there were dozens of different ethnicities in the balkans in ancient times and dacian , thracian and illyrian were different languages . 
  however , the substrate of romanian and proto-albanian were definitely the same language . 
  identifying this proto-albanian language with any ancient language or ethnic is not conclusive , though . 
  congratulations to our albanians brothers !, 
  a little known ethno-linguistic fact : romanians are basically albanians who learned latin and albanians are romanians who did not fully learn latin . 
  the romanian substrate ( the words inherited from the language the romanians spoke before learning latin ) is a form of proto-albanian . 
  the latin words in albanian ( and they have a lot of them ) are borrowed from proto-romanian ( also known as balkan latin ) . 
  the church was not illegal , it was just discouraged . 
  a complete ban on religion was only in albania and it worked : the albanians are not very religious . 
  yes , they do , they recognize it using the word marriage . 
  see what the [ british government ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/creating-a-fairer-and-more-equal-society/supporting-pages/equal-marriage-for-gay-lesbian-bisexual-and-trans-people-and-protecting-lgbt-rights ) or the [ french government ] ( http://www.service-public.fr/actualites/002563.html ) say . 
  actually , the eu took some very decisive actions when hungary 's government decided to meddle in the `` independence '' of its national bank . 
  the eu thinks the protecting `` rights '' of the banks is a more important issue than protecting the rights of the people . 
  ok , `` former socialist countries in europe '' . 
  i wo n't use `` central and eastern europe '' since it 's just as pointless as `` eastern europe '' . 
  [ same sex marriage status in europe  ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg/1000px-same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg.png ) * dark blue = marriage * light blue = civil unions * red = constitutional ban * silver = neither ----- in eastern europe ( bold for eu countries ) : * civil unions = ** czechia , slovenia , hungary ** * unregistered cohabitation = ** croatia ** * constitutional ban = ** poland , slovakia , bulgaria , croatia , latvia , lithuania , ** serbia , montenegro , moldova , ukraine , belarus * neither = ** romania , estonia , ** bosnia , albania , macedonia, 
  a slovenian friend asked `` what kind of a country is romania , if for them , serbia is ` the west ' '' ? 
  we 're lucky people !, 
  i know we are , but we like to pretend we 're central european . 
  i ca n't tell if it 's trolling or serious . 
  probably a bit of both . 
  yeah , seagulls have been colonizing cities more and more inland . 
  they no longer eat fish , they eat rubbish . 
  bucharest was colonized a decade ago and now they 've colonized some cities in transylvania . 
  i wonder how they crossed the mountains . 
  here in romania , it brings you luck to step in shit . 
  i have an english friend who calls them `` sky rats '' . 
  he really hates them because they 're `` dirty '' . 
  it shows the situation in practice . 
  nagorno-karabakh , south ossetia , transnistria and kosovo are in practice independent . 
  i think the old russia has them , too .
