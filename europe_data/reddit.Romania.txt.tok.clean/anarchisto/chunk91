  subsidized child-care is a form of benefits for parents . 
  i do n't have a problem with russians . 
  i have some problems with their leadership , but i do so with the americans ' or germans ' leadership , too . 
  nobody likes us !, 
  the czech flag is the polish flag trying to squeeze in some blue . 
  imo , the problem is not that politicians get arrested and that corporations get investigated . 
  that 's excellent , i just wish it was universal , not politicized . 
  the problem is that this anti-corruption campaign has a certain ideological and geopolitical bend . 
  for instance , this probe about the refinery privatization was started right now because the refinery ( which was bought by a romanian businessman who sold it to a kazakh company ) was just bought from the kazakhs by a chinese company . 
  it 's a signal to chinese investors not to buy out assets in romania . 
  if it would have been bought by a western company , there would have been no investigation . 
  there were far worse privatizations than this refinery , including the privatization of the biggest oil company , petrom , which was most likely the biggest theft of public assets in the history of romania . 
  there will never be any investigation about that because it was bought by an austrian company . 
  there will be no investigation for the sell-off of then-monopoly romtelecom ( today owned by deutsche telekom ) , even though the bribe is a matter of public record . 
  and the same for thousands of other companies . 
   we were doing good even with worse stats . 
  1970s ( industry-based ) economy is very different from today 's ( information-based ) economy . 
  so only the people who converts to christianity remained . 
   i do n't know what went of it , the news kind of stopped on it ... 
  the eu said that romania must not pay anything to that company , or else we 'll have to pay a fine to the eu as well . 
  then why do the turks get visa-free travel ? 
  they do n't have any protection for gays . 
  so cannibals should should try vegetarians ? 
  affirmative action is an institutional practice . 
  this guy participated in two elections ( internal elections in the labour party and the actual elections ) . 
  a rich guy from an old jewish banking family , married to a rothschild . 
   boris johnson also has a rich history of making ludicrous statements you might say that saying ludicrous things actually improves your electability . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/01/leaked-ttip-documents-cast-doubt-on-eu-us-trade-deal  disputes over pesticides residues and food safety would be dealt with by the un food and agriculture organisation 's codex alimentarius system . 
    environmentalists say the body has loose rules on corporate influence , allowing employees of companies such as basf , nestle and coca cola to sit on -- and sometimes lead -- national delegations . 
  some ** 44 % of its decisions on pesticides residues have been less stringent than eu ones ** , with 40 % of rough equivalence and 16 % being more demanding , according to greenpeace . 
  ttip would force the eu to allow import of food that is approved in the us . 
  so if there is us-produced food having traces of an approved us pesticide ( within the limits allowed in the us law ) , it will be allowed to be imported into the eu , even if that pesticide is banned for use here . 
  eu version : if a pesticide is ** suspected ** to be dangerous to public health , it is banned . 
  us version : if a pesticide is ** proven ** to be dangerous to public health , it is banned . 
   to be fair , the soviet system was a huge polluter too ** surprise state capitalism !!, 
   are n't you worried that such a huge jump in spending over just one year will not be spend effectively ? 
  no , i 'm not worried . 
  i know that they 'll get into someone 's pocket , so there 's no worry about that . 
  i am not op , but i would n't care either way . 
  if i 'm dead , i do n't have feelings anymore . 
  people think marx wrote mostly about communism , but his specialty was explaining how capitalism works . 
   just that their class struggle is based on marginalised groups instead of economic class . 
  so basically , it has nothing to do with marxism . 
  marxism ( at least how marx thought it ) has always been about economics . 
  reminds me how marx said about the french marxists that if those are `` marxists '' , then he is not one . 
   marx made his famous remark that , if their politics represented marxism , `` ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi , je ne suis pas marxiste '' ( `` what is certain is that i myself am not a marxist '' ) .

  actually , it 's in the title :  wartime roundup of ** paris ** jews paris was n't under vichy france control . 
  the french state had absolutely no control over the territories occupied by germany . 
  it 's absurd to claim otherwise . 
  the state can apologize for what its citizens did ( the collaborators ) and it 's normal to do so , but it is not itself responsible . 
  she is right in this case . 
  blaming france for what happened during the german occupation of paris is the same as blaming poland for the rounding up of jews in poland . 
  the jews were rounded up with the help of french collaborationists , but the french state had absolutely no control over the city of paris during the roundup . 
  the city has been under german military administration . 
  actually , she 's technically right . 
  the french state was not responsible for what happened to the paris jews , as paris was under german occupation , no longer controlled even by the non-democratic vichy france . 
  however , the people who rounded up the jews in paris were french collaborationists . 
  schengen has nothing to do with residency rights , that 's part of the basic eu treaties . 
  they 're former colonies . 
  divorce tends to be much more likely in long-distance marriages than in normal marriages . 
  i 'm saying what the article is saying :  left-wing candidates jean-luc melenchon and benoit hamon have said the drug should be legalised   mr hamon has said he wants to legalise cannabis completely , with state-controlled and taxed sales points where adults can buy cannabis . 
    mr melenchon has also said cannabis should be legalised so it can be better controlled . 
  tldr , from left to right : * m\u00e9lenchon : ** legal ** * hamon : ** legal ** * macron : illegal ; 100 $ fine * fillon : illegal ; fine * le pen : illegal ; prison, 
   there is no massive refugee influx from iraq . 
  that 's false . 
  for instance , 86.000 iraqi refugees reached the shores of greece in 2015 . 
  more illegal immigrants and black market workers , further depressing the wages of locals ? 
  at least this was the case for romania : more than a million romanians were already living in the eu illegally by the time we joined the eu . 
  the old buildings had very little architectural value and the few buildings with some architectural value were not old ( early 20th century ) . 
  there is one exception , the v\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti monastery , which was both and it 's a shame they demolished it . 
  that was not old ( late 19th/early 20th century ) and it was not the city center . 
   demolishing the old city centre of bucharest the old city centre of bucharest was not demolished . 
  the companies that produce military hardware tend to be big and , as such , their capital is more international . 
  when the government spends on other things ( from social spending to infrastructure ) , the money tends to reach smaller locally-owned companies . 
  well , nato is not necessary if we can replace it with a european alliance . 
  made in germany , by companies whose shares are owned by american companies . 
  look at the biggest shareholders of defence companies like rheinmetall and you 'll see a list full of us investment funds , us pension funds , etc. 
   in theory it 's a good thing that the copyright is very well protected in germany . 
  it means that artists are protected . 
  the artists hate the copyright organization ( gema ) just the same . 
  there 's a difference between `` a passionate plea '' vs. giving a deadline . 
  of course , but forcing it up other countries ' throat like this is something new . 
  this increase in defense spending is not needed . 
  the eu already spends 4 times what russia ( the biggest `` potential enemy '' ) spends . 
  trump thinks like a businessman . 
  he wants us companies to sell more . 
  the point behind this is that a lot of the new defense spending is going to be on us-made equipment or equipment made by ( or through collaborations with ) us companies . 
  even though this attitude would affect the us standings and geopolitics , as long as it brings more money to the us , it 's ok for him . 
   then what ? 
  then you get a fake invoice printed by trump . 
  since the profit margin is high , the return on investment is quite high , so it makes sense to invest . 
  of course some of the oligarchs do n't , but they lose market share , as others do invest . 
  from what i read , the last few years , the production increased by a total of 15 % , so the measures did have some effect . 
  it depends on whose side will the uk government be : the financial industry or the goods-producing industry . 
  my bet is that the financial industry 's lobby is much stronger within the conservative party . 
  the neo-communist who implemented much of the neoliberal reforms and privatized everything for peanuts ? 
  yeah , a lot of communism in his governments . 
  they made this choice purely for strategic reasons . 
  following europe 's sanctions , they feel they can no longer trust it as a secure source of their food .
