  atheism is simply not visible in the public media . 
   does n't she have some economical left wing rhetoric ? 
  not really . 
  she does have a populist rhetoric and she supports involvement of the state in the economy , but not every such involvement is left-wing . 
  i 'd argue it 's center-right . 
  much more moderate right-wing than fillon . 
  economically , she 's center-right . 
  or the turks . 
  actually , he was not an employee directly of ikea , but of a big norwegian logistics company , bring . 
  but yeah , still scandinavian . 
  same in romania . 
  most likely , it 's included in the estimate , otherwise the difference to western europe would be greater . 
  having little industry does help . 
  romania produces industrial goods worth $ 3.596 per capita . 
  germany produces $ 13.194 of industrial goods per capita . 
  additionally , we are too poor to have big houses and we ca n't afford many appliances . 
  that 's not at all surprising , the man said it himself years ago : `` democracy is like a train : when you reach your destination , you get off . '', 
  but access to medicine is a big problem . 
  in romania , among the young people ( 18-35 age group ) , 16 % do not have medical insurance , so , unless it 's an emergency , they 're not getting any kind of medical services without paying for it . 
  most of these 16 % belong to the roma minorities , who are not employed nor studying . 
  since they do n't have medical insurance , they 're typically do n't have a family physician , where they should get the vaccines for their kids ( children are automatically insured ) . 
  if you live in an isolated village and your income is just the social benefits , you ca n't afford to go to the city ( since in your village , there 's no doctor ) several times to keep asking them if they brought the vaccine , like i did . 
  also , these are people with very limited education , who do n't know much about vaccines and do n't understand the importance . 
  in romania , if you 're not very persistent , you wo n't get your child vaccinated . 
  maybe i 'm crazy , but i think the state should take care that all the children are vaccinated . 
  there are plenty of other places where the view is not spoiled by bridges . 
  stockholm is spread on many islands , so there is plenty of space for that . 
  most of the children are from the roma minority , who have have limited access to medicine . 
  the parents must struggle a bit to get the children vaccinated ; for instance , for my child , the vaccine was delayed a few months due to vaccine shortages ( mainly due to government incompetence and corruption ) . 
  also , this attitude of many loyalists seems to make the eastern europeans more likely to identify as `` irish '' rather than `` british '' . 
  [ also , they seem to burn a palestinian flag and , for some reason , an upside-down polish flag . 
   but the financial sector accounts for maybe +90 % of the economy close enough . 
  services make up 86.8 % of the economy . 
  you do n't choose your clerk . 
  you are assigned randomly . 
  unless you 're inelligible , they do n't give you a reason for refusal . 
  usually , they refuse you because you were not able to convince the embassy staff that you do n't want to remain illegally in the us . 
  it 's not the nanny , it 's the guy 's wife . 
  you would n't know what to do with the mountains . 
  i think politicians should n't hold dual citizenship anyway . 
  also , there are not many other valuable assets in the country . 
  russia 's wealth of the 1 % is mostly related to the ownership of the resource-extracting companies . 
  same here . 
  virtually all the richest romanians belong to at least one category : * politicians ( current or communist party ) * securitate ( former secret police ) agents or other employees . 
  * people who stole ( or got for free , using their connections ) various assets from the state many belong to all of these categories . 
  the central bank is indeed independent , but it must respect the rules that were set up in the legislation drafted by the political leaders . 
  of course , ecb is just an instrument that does what the political leaders want . 
  basically , it does what germany and france want . 
  yes , loaning out billions ( or rather , trillions ) at a near-zero interest rates . 
  if greece had to pay the same low interest rates for its loans as the banks do , they would have no such problems . 
  read about `` quantitative easing '' . 
   definition : quantitative easing ( qe ) is a massive expansion of the open market operations of a central bank . 
  the bank buys securities from its member banks to add liquidity to capital markets . 
  this has the same effect as increasing the money supply . 
  in return , it issues credit to the banks ' reserves to buy the securities .

   tuscany beign a german state then you could argue that germany has a great cuisine . 
   even in our ancestral lands in todays poland and czhecia before migration to adriatic we where next to each other i 'm pretty sure when we colonize the galaxy , you 'll both end up colonizing the same planet . 
  because the press is writing new articles attacking him every day . 
  like hawking is saying , `` many of his policies are sound '' , but he is `` portrayed as a left-wing extremist '' , by the press . 
  little known fact : [ the model in the 19th century painting revolutionary romania ] ( https://i.imgur.com/oeib85n.jpg ) is not actually romanian , she 's the english-born ( or rather , guernseyan ) wife of c. a. rosetti , a romanian leader of the 1848 revolution in wallachia . 
   did n't most of them just left after ww2 ? 
  * some were killed by antonescu 's government , particularly in bessarabia and bukovina ; antonescu also killed many in the occupied territories in ukraine ( particularly in the odessa region ) * some were killed by the hungary 's horty government , as hungary got half of transylvania ; virtually all jews from that part were sent to auschwitz * most of the rest left after wwii , particularly to israel and the us . 
  it would n't have changed one thing . 
  many szekely are protestants and their region is one of the least developed in romania . 
  their politicians are just as corrupt as the romanian orthodox ones . 
  the unemployment is in villages and small towns far away from the big cities . 
  the problem has long been that the minimum wage was so low that it was impossible to live off this wage in bucharest or other big city . 
  in 2007 , this minimum wage was 110 $ gross . 
  now it 's higher ( 300 $ gross ) , but still far from enough . 
  so people still prefer the 30 $ / month benefits and rely on subsistence agriculture rather than the 300 $ / month that is barely enough to rent an apartment and pay for groceries . 
  unemployment rate in romania may be low , but the employment rate is also low . 
  it looks real , or very little color correction . 
  it looks just like some very dark clouds + sun . 
  or , worse , the good ol' middle of the street in india . 
  did their parents personally oppressed and tortured anyone ? 
  they just came to work in the factories there . 
  in the village in d\u00e2mbovi\u021ba county where my grandparents lived , the river is also as dirty as in the pictures . 
  [ we 're the eu country where tourism has the lowest percentage of gdp . 
  ] ( http://www.dohop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/08/gdp.jpg ) it 's not because we do n't have potential . 
  we have medieval towns , mountains , beaches , the danube delta , etc. 
  that picture is from the jiu river . 
  but it happens everywhere : * [ firiza ( baia mare county ) ] ( http://www.informatia-zilei.ro/mm/wp-content/gallery/baraj-mizerie/baraj-mizerie01.jpg ) * [ bicaz ( neam\u021b county ) ] ( http://catalinpop.ro/fotonunti/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/baraj_bicaz-1.jpg ) * [ v\u0103leni ( neam\u021b county ) ] ( http://ziarpiatraneamt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nesimtire-neamt.jpg ) * [ cinci\u0219 ( hunedoara county ) ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2010/01/05/50a8ae427c42d5a663722efd/646x404.jpg ) * [ cerna ( cara\u0219 severin county ) ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2014/05/06/5368d71c0d133766a868293c/627x0.jpg ) * [ v\u0103deni ( gorj county ) ] ( http://cdn1.gds.ro:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/peturi-jiu-vadeni-3.jpg ) etc. 
  at least in romania , the anti-pollution regulations are not worth the paper on which they 're written . 
  [ rivers and lakes look like this ] ( http://www.igj.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sticle-jiu.jpg ) . 
  that 's because we 're taught in school it 's 5 . 
  and the number is 5 because in 19th century we stressed our link with the great roman empire and latin , so we modelled our understanding of romanian grammar on latin grammar , even though it made little sense . 
  if we say genitive is a distinct case , we might as well say we have a locative ( which would be accusative-nominative with a preposition ) . 
  for romania , the `` traditional '' number is 5 , but a more fair number is actually 3 : nominative-accusative , genitive-dative and vocative . 
  the genitive is basically dative with a preposition , while the accusative is nominative with various prepositions . 
  are the ladies also . jpg ? 
  better than the `` ex-ottoman empire '' folder . 
  some people vote for the politicians ' personalities , not for their policies . 
  i 'm sorry , estonia , i am a coin collector and i categorize the estonian coins in the `` ex-ussr '' folder , not in the `` nordic '' folder . 
  the original imperialism . 
  `` pul\u0103 '' ( dick ) is also derived from the same latin word for chick . 
  spanish also has the word `` polla '' ( same meaning ) . 
  the bulgarian `` pujka '' is identical to the romanian word `` puic\u0103 '' ( [ female ] chicken ) , itself from `` pui '' ( [ male ] chicken ) , from latin `` pullus '' ( chick ) . 
  i 'm not sure about tigers , but there were big cats in europe before we killed them all . 
  for instance , the european cave lion went extinct around 11.000 bc , while the european lion around 100 bc ( according to roman and greek writings ) .
