  that 's violence . 
  taking a child in your arms and putting him in a room is not violence . 
  spanking him is violence . 
  for instance this : [ violent childhood experiences and the risk of intimate partner violence in adults ] ( http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260502238733 ), 
  [ there are still some european countries that do n't ban corporal punishments ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/corporal_punishment_in_europe.svg ) : * in the eu : italy , france , great britain , belgium , czechia , slovakia * outside the eu : switzerland , serbia , montenegro , bosnia , russia , belarus , turkey, 
   a spanking on the bottom is beating now ? 
  really ? 
  there are studies that show that kids that are spanked are more likely to be violent against their partner later in life . 
  it 's as if children learn how to behave from their parents . 
  is n't it fascinating ? 
  if the child is big enough to understand you , talk to him/her . 
  if the child is not big enough to understand you , then spanking him/her is pointless , because he/she wo n't understand you . 
  [ which side is the balkan and which is mitteleuropa ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdrhqnz9lo ), 
  in romania , we used to use roman numbers for the month . 
  for instance , 20-viii-2017 . 
  most capital in romania is foreign . 
  for instance , out of romania 's the top 100 exporters , 96 are foreign-owned . 
  very few of these foreign-owned companies have any profits declared in romania . 
  they prefer to pay taxes either in their home countries or in tax havens , leaving romania 's branches with zero profit , despite having their actual activities here . 
  what is your party 's stance on this kind of tax avoidance ? 
  peasants = small-scale subsistence farmers . 
  of course , thailand is richer than vietnam . 
  vietnam was completely devastated in a 30-year war and that leaves marks on the country even after many decades . 
  nevertheless , the gap is lowering : the average growth in thailand is around 3 % , while in vietnam it 's around 6 % . 
   thailand seems like a better choice . 
  better government . 
  the military junta ? 
  yeah , those chaps are nice , as long as you do what they say . 
  the best food i 've eaten in southern italy was in places that did n't really seemed hygienic . 
  you have to remember that germany does n't have yet same-sex marriage . 
  it gets less important , but its adepts are getting more and more radical . 
   and please stop trying to pass off islam as a european thing because it 's not . 
  well , european native flavor of islam is not the same as the middle east one . 
  bosnian or tatar muslims are integrated in their own countries and they are not causing any problems . 
   those lazy free loading germans came into our lands to steal our jobs as economic migrants during the viking era , scandinavians would go to `` grikland '' ( byzantine empire ) to work as migrant workers , then returning with the money to their homeland to start a family . 
  one of the good jobs they took was bodyguards ( varangian guards ) . 
   the external debt climbed only 9 % governmental debt [ went up from 13 % in 2008 to 37 % in 2012 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/romania/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
  it tripled , it was up by 24 % , not just by 9 % . 
   romania has had its share of right-wing governments , and it did fairly well . 
  actually , austerity failed in romania pretty the same way it failed across europe . 
  do you mean that catalunya does n't have 50.000 councilors ? 
  it was the most prosperous for the corrupt elite . 
  the peasants ( who made up  80 % of the country 's population ) had terrible life standards . 
  for instance , more than one in five children died before reaching 1 year , leading to a life expectancy of only 40 years . 
  much of this was due to the lack of healthcare in the countryside . 
  the growth is still strong , estimated to be around 4 % . 
  the uk will leave the eu and the eu will pay for it !, 
  sounds too much like : the us will build a wall and mexico will pay for it !, 
   the bible forbids homosexuality and gay marriage . 
  yes , the bible bans homosexuality in the same old testament book that also forbids eating shellfish and pork . 
  catholics have no problem eating those . 
  the church 's argument is that the ban is only addressed to the jews , being part of their customs . 
  why ca n't this argument be used about the homosexuality ban ? 
  a real cut of the debt , not just barely enough to pay the huge interest rates . 
  currently , the greek debt is at 180 % of the gdp and they pay an annual 7 % interest for their 10y bonds . 
  assuming no bail-out special interest rates , they would have to ** pay each year 12.6 % of their gdp ** just for the interest , without paying any of the principal . 
  this is not possible to keep in the long run . 
  for comparison , the german debt is at 71 % and it has a 0.4 % interest rate , so germany would pay ** 0.28 % of its gdp in interest ** . 
  ( of course , the actual interest paid is different , since germany borrowed at both higher and lower interest rates than the current 0.4 % ), 
  they banned smoking in workplaces . 
  the horror !, 
  the human rights violation !, 
  i know the argument : because a part of the money would be wasted due to corruption , we should spend no money to improve the lives of the people . 
   government spending is inversely related with economic growth . 
  sweden has high economic growth ( for that income group ) , high government spending . 
  the wonders of having a low government spending : * low education spending . 
  this means that once in a while we hear some colourful news about how a 7-year old died after falling in a [ rural school latrine ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/186/3927/15711551/2/6031587-mediafax-foto-ovidiu-dumitru-matiu.jpg ) . 
  the local authorities claim there 's no money to build decent toilets , things go on as usual . 
  * low healthcare spending . 
  this means that doctors are paid next-to-nothing ( a junior doctor starts at around 300 $ / month ) . 
  half of the doctors left the country during the last decade and most of the smaller hospitals are expected to be closed soon due to lack of doctors . 
  you can see news about how a smaller hospital there 's just one doctor who is in charge with emergency , doing things outside his speciality . 
  the government claims there 's no money to do it . 
  * low infrastructure spending . 
  this means that a third of romanians have no indoor plumbing and a fifth have no adequate water supply ( relying on unsafe shallow wells ) . 
  this is not just in the rural areas : there are plenty of people living in bucharest who have no access to plumbing . 
  ( i know , the argument is that they 're gypsies , so we should n't build sewerage on their streets ) * low social spending . 
  this means we have [ the highest overall poverty rate in the eu ( 2014 , eurostat ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/6/6b/people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion%2c_by_age_group%2c_2014.png ) . 
  40.2 % of romanians are `` at risk of poverty '' and 51 % of romanian children live in poverty ( according to eurostat ) we do have * some * welfare benefits : 31 $ / month/person , and in order to get them you need to do 5 days of community service per month ( basically , it 's `` workfare '' , not `` welfare '' , being paid at 0.77 $ / h -- that 's less than half the minimum wage ) . 
  cuba is as dangerous as haiti or jamaica ? 
  you just have to look at the homicide rates and see it 's not like this : * jamaica : 36 homicides/100k of population * puerto rico : 18 homicides/100k of population * haiti : 10 homicides/100k of population * cuba : 4.2 homicides/100k of population * united states : 3.9 homicides/100k of population, 
  swedes are better educated than eastern europeans and yet , they have more children . 
  i have several co-workers from sweden who have 3 children , which is unheard of among the middle class in romania . 
  in 11 months ( january-november ) . 
  btw , what energy source do you use in sweden for heating ? 
  when i stayed for 2 months in stockholm , the apartment had district heating ; do n't district heating plants in sweden use gas ? 
  * residential ( heating , cooking ) * agriculture ( converted into fertilizers , heating greenhouses ) * industrial ( much of the chemical industry is based on gas ) * power generation ( much cleaner than coal , fast to start , so gas plants are used in combination with renewables for countries that do n't have enough hydro ) * transportation ( cars running on natural gas ; in bucharest , it 's common for taxis to run on liquefied petroleum gas ), 
   we are a very cynical country . 
  not as cynical as the italians . 
  but maybe the italians are right about theirs . 
  jesus and virgin mary are the other two ? 
   add to those all major public service companies in any city nowadays , state-owned companies are irrelevant to the romanian economy . 
  a few natural monpolies and public utilities , making up less than 5 % of the gdp . 
   awardly , you seem to confuse private ownership of capital with liberalism . 
  the basic liberal economic ideas are widespread private ownership and free markets . 
  romania got both during the 1990s . 
  but the process of consolidation of economic power in the big corporations is continuing . 
  according to official statistics , large corporations made up 51 % of the economy 's turnover in 2011 , up to 53 % in 2015 . 
  small businesses went down from 34.9 % to 33 % .
