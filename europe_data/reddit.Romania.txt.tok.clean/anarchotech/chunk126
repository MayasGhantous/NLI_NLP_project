  key speech points : * `` i promise to be everyones president . 
  both of those that consider themselves the left and the right . 
  both to those that want , as well as those that do n't want to be along russia . '', 
  * `` dear citizens that voted for maia sandu . 
  i will take your all your wishes into account , all your requests , all your beliefs . '', 
  * `` we do n't need a divided society . 
  we moldovans do n't need this . '', 
  translation :  title : igor dodon is the third president of the republic of moldova chosen through direct popular vote  the psrm candidate igor dodon won the election and has become the third directly elected president of the country . 
  after counting 96,83 % of votes , dodon has 55,17 % of the total electorate . 
  his opponent , pas candidate maia sandu won 44,83 % of the vote . 
   moldovans have actively pariticipated in the second presidential election . 
  until 22.00 , over 1.605.000 citizens took to the polls , over 53 % of the electorate , according to cec data . 
   it 's just that bulgaria does n't have a big stick in the grand scheme of things . 
  neither does romania , but together we can make the stick . 
  a black sea fleet , a united command , joint-defenses around the eastern border . 
  even go on the geopolitical offensive and convince turkey to get back into the fold . 
  russia understand power . 
  it would understand us shruging and saying `` we 're just securing our borders and maintaining good relations with neighbors '' . 
  it would complain , but it will understand . 
  just like how russia and turkey seemed to be at the edge of conflict , and then suddenly did a 180 and declared friendship . 
   then is n't it logical to try keeping good relations with russia as well ? 
  good relations with russia are built on the solid foundations of `` do n't fuck with me '' . 
  look at how china deals with russia , same with iran . 
  openly friendly , and carrying big sticks . 
   i do n't know man , those are n't really the old days . 
  look at ukraine , serbia . 
  we 've got a little eu bubble going so far . 
  it 's not strong , it 's been pierced , but we can still hope to hold the line . 
   what can putin give to trump is my question . 
  my thoughts : trump hands over russia 's desired sphere of influence including a portion of the middle east , and russia 's job is then to police it so it does n't become the us 's problem . 
  us keeps their hands clean of the killings and dictator support , trump can say he got the us out , and everyone gets to watch russia bomb the fuck out of syria so it does n't feel like trump made it easier for the terrorists . 
  meanwhile russia gets 2 things : us and the gas/petrol corridor to the rest of europe . 
  i think , much like rados\u0142aw sikorski said , that we have invested way to much into the us/nato-relationship for a false sense of security . 
  so yeah , i think if we do n't pull off something akin to the intermarium soon , we 're back to the bad old days of being cut into pieces by foreign empires . 
  how many of us in eastern europe will he sell off to `` get along with russia '' ? 
  sorry , but we 're all a bit on edge right now . 
  the moment trump and putin meet , there might just be a map of europe between them . 
  chill . 
  if you ca n't handle a bit of self-deprecation , you 're taking yourself way too seriously . 
  it 's eastern europe , we 're all a bit shit , it 's ok to say it . 
  only hope : no one gets a majority . 
  my apologizes , i realize you 're on a very strict shitposting schedule . 
  have you actually watched the entire series ? 
   no germans = pecefull europe . 
  christ on a stick . 
  europe is always in war whenever the balance of powers of game is played . 
  the german 's did n't create this , this has been the truth of our existence until 2001 . 
   eu model has failed . 
  it has only benefited germany . 
  `` murdoch media told me so . '', 
  come to eastern europe and see the eu funded development . 
  or go to the west and see people starting a new life there . 
  versailles was the winners writing history . 
  i know extra history gets some flak but their `` start of ww1 '' videos is a good run-down how tragic that war was : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-wsl4wquws&amp;index=5&amp;list=plhykya0yj_5aq7g4bil7bngi0a8gtsawu, 
   better ties with russia . 
  [ with the amount of ass kissing going around lately ... ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder663/500x/73142663.jpg ), 
   ** both ** started by the germans . 
  there 's enough blame to go around the table when talking ww1 , germans do n't stand out . 
   what exactly changes between a municipal level and federal/national level so drastically that it would cause civil war ? 
  do n't know about him , but i would argue that the further away from the municipal level you get , the more technical , abstract and non-obvious the discussions get . 
  syriza and varoufakis 's diem25 both argued for reforming and democratising the eurozone/eurogroup . 
  neither were so mad or stooped so low as to suggest dismembering the union . 
  not believing the first thing i 'm told is not me being obtuse . 
  asking for statements to be sourced is not me being difficult . 
  when i look at newspapers and see judges being called `` enemies of the state '' , that 's not slander , that 's not bias , that 's not `` he-says-she-says '' . 
  that 's the newspaper itself saying `` this is ok to print '' . 
  the police do n't have a `` political slant '' by telling people to watch out , they 're not in the pocket of `` mainstream media '' or `` detached elites '' . 
  this is no longer `` culture war '' mud flinging , truth is relative , `` wake up sheeple '' non-sense . 
  this is the opening of the gates of tartarus . 
  right , so it 's just anyone with a public persona . 
  that makes it alright ? 
   it 's widely known , and his party insisted after the murder of cox . 
  `` it 's widely known . '', 
  yeah , that about cover it , does n't it . 
   because this in no way represents what british politics are currently like . 
  you 're saying this in a thread with the title `` police tell brexit legal challenger gina miller it is unsafe for her to go outside amid abuse '' . 
   farage needs security escort almost permanently , by the way . 
  does he ? 
  where is that ? 
  and why ca n't he convince the police to feed into this narrative of `` equalness '' , because from the outside looking in , i 'm not seeing `` enemy of the people '' being printed in the news with his face next o it . 
  i 'm seeing death , threats , people being told by police to be afraid . 
  and you 're telling me brexiters are victims too because they feel intimidated . 
  they can feel how they like , but they 're not the ones who ca n't leave the house apparently . 
  farrage is meeting a president in trump tower after threatening violent protests , while this woman ca n't leave the house for standing up for the rule of law . 
  i 'm sorry , having an entire side being bullied , threatened , and made too scared to speak is not something to score political points on ? 
  do you want to tell that to gina miller ? 
  how about the judge who 's preference in partners apparently is supposed to make him unfit to decide things ? 
  all of this is unheard of in british politics , and we should treat this as run-of-the-mill ? 
   a pathologist found he suffered fatal breathing difficulties after alcohol and drug consumption and the cause of death was given as positional asphyxiation . 
  do n't do drugs kids . 
  do they ? 
  we 've seen one political murder so far , and it was n't a brexiter . 
  the word `` traitor '' , sorry `` enemy of the people '' , has been coming from one direction . 
   how do you explain how she is forcing all the eu countries to accept more refugees you have to read up on the timeline of that decision . 
  until august 2015 she was adamantly pro-dublin agreement insisting on first country processing . 
  what happened to change her mind ? 
  she got told by the hungarian government that the situation was no longer under control . 
  so since dublin agreement could n't keep migrants out of germany , she decided to do the next best thing , have everyone else share the burden with them . 
  and we got the quotas , just another way for merkel to minimize the amount of migrants in germany with the added bonus of looking humane .
