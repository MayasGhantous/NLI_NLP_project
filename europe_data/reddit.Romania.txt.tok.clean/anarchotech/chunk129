  this is why i am a european federalist . 
  the mechanics of the `` western betrayal '' are still there , they need to be dismantled and replaced . 
  the baltics need to be moved from `` a country far away '' to a political linchpin to the people with a hand over the button . 
  anything less than that , is a game of historical re-enactment . 
  mate , it ai n't my country , so i have no stake in debating the `` technically correct '' true leave campaign , or what was implied by the anti-immigration showmen . 
  but you 're just going to have to eat the fact that we 're going to be seeing a lot of backpeddling and if all you can muster is `` technically no one said that we 're going to be completely up the wall bonkers , just a little loose in the head '' you 're going to get people who give you a look . 
  you think that 's unacceptable and unfair ? 
  try having a government which actually knows what it 's doing rather than being in what seems to be a party civil war , and an actual end goal rather than canned soundbites . 
   if it comes down to a war , we just nuke russia . 
  no circling . 
  no strategy . 
  believe it or not , no one wants to be nuked , and the surest way to not be nuked is not to start nuking . 
  america is n't going to nuke russia because of the baltics , and russia is n't going to nuke anyone unless it 's facing total loss ( nuclear deescalation strategy ) and so a gentlemen 's agreement is made , as was made during the proxy wars of the cold war . 
  war is n't gone because of the nuclear bomb , it just has different rules and limits . 
   and how can russia wage a war ? 
  its economy would collapse . 
  do n't be a carthaginian . 
  war is run by men , material , tools and talent . 
  the actual money part is irrelevant , the ability to muster those resources to a point , while maintaining national will , is what determines victory . 
  plenty of rich states learned that those are not things you can buy overnight , and plenty of small rugged forces managed to defeat them because of that . 
  to begin with , there were at least two leave campaigns , and a dozen talking heads . 
  i bet someone did actually say exactly that . 
  the same way we had people say `` we are n't going to pay a penny '' , the foreign office minister in fact , just before the goalpost moving `` no one said we wo n't pay anything '' starting being kicked around . 
  it 's pretty much a game of mad libs right now when it comes to this stuff . 
  and it is moving goal posts , because you 're not going to cut down immigration . 
  you ca n't reasonably do so without shooting yourselves in the foot . 
  if the tory government could do it safely , it could have done years ago , and won itself more votes . 
  so you back pedal on employment in the nhs , on banking , on it , on the farming industry , on the service industry , on the car industry , on every single industry that needs any sort of labour , and you 're going to be hit with the same aphorism `` no one said there will be no immigration '' . 
  until you finally hit the status quo , and we 're all watching mouth agape on what can possibly be the most massive self-gaslighting the world has seen in this century . 
  see , i agree . 
  but at the same time we have a bigger problem : we ca n't let the banks fail . 
  them taking the hit is actually completely unacceptable , the systematic damage would have been too great . 
  the only sane thing was to bail them out . 
  and unfortunately while iceland could just break icesave and move that bailout onto the uk and netherlands , greece had to swallow the entire cost . 
  is this fair ? 
  reason why even varoufakis wanted a more integrated eurozone to deal with that , but no one wanted that sort of loss of sovereignty . 
  the answer was not more europe , remember ? 
  and this is not really a euro problem , this is a problem with the very setup around banking and how it 's become such an integral part of a web of investment and wealth redistribution , while at the same time remaining in largely private hands . 
  on how it 's become international while still being engaged with by national actors . 
  how it 's interrelated across the globe , but lacking global rules . 
  and that hits the sickly worse than the healthy . 
  and greece was a sickly creature , loosing tourist revenue and competitive edge to nearby cheaper balkan countries while increasing it 's spending . 
  and , to add salt to that wound , they then engaged in a half a decade long pr campaign helped by the anglo-media to paint themselves on the edge of collapse , which scared away even more investment and customers . 
  i 'm not unsympathetic . 
  but in my opinion , the greeks have not been dealing in realities the past few years , and we 're still far away from shifting the blame solely onto the baking system or the , in my opinion poorly designed and unintegrated , esm/eurogroup rather than government incompetence . 
  i imagine it would go something like this : `` of course there will be some immigration . 
  no one said there will be no immigration . 
  it 's just that we were against uncontrolled immigration . 
  we 'll still issue visas to the many experts , service personnel and seasonal workers we need to have our economy work . 
  but now it will be with the added benefit of more bureaucracy and confusion , while telling ourselves we are in control . '', 
  it 's pretty much a game of moving goalposts . 
  prepare for `` no one said we were n't going to give up some control to the eu '' in a few months the way things are going . 
  i 'm sorry but this is more than a little bullshit . 
  we 're extremely familiar with corruption , budgetary deficit and inflation in romania . 
  and when government after government tries to get as much money as possible , it is n't the bankers who provided that money who are at fault . 
  the banks were more stupid than malicious in giving that money to them , as they were with the subprime investments . 
  but in the end it was greeks who looked at the ever increasing loans and said `` we 'll pay it back , get more . '' . 
  greece is n't some poor , uneducated twat getting a payday loan from an unscrupulous loanshark . 
  it 's a government of an entire state who decided to run incredible budgetary deficits for years and did n't mind borrowing to do it . 
  and the reason it has n't defaulted is because it wants to keep borrowing , not end up like romania or bulgaria with low sovereign debt because no on wants to give us money to begin with . 
  i can say this with full confidence because i know that if romania was in the same position and people were actually prepared to loan us money , our shitty greedy populist governments would have done the same . 
  hell , they are trying to do the same right now . 
  and we know exactly who to blame . 
  thank you . 
  because there is nothing inherently `` better '' about us as people than those people who lived a hundred years ago . 
  we just have the institutions in place to keep us walking the narrow path of civilization . 
  when those institutions start looking like those of the past , they invite repetition of the past . 
  this continent sparks into war in under a 100 years at the best of times , and it has a history of people naively trying to arrange weak international systems to prevent it thinking that all the continent needs is another debate chamber . 
  the council of europe , the league of nations , the concert of europe . 
  and we 're going back again . 
  russia and turkey now disregard international order as it 's inconvenient for them , countries like hungary , poland and serbia are trying to play all sides as if that has ever worked for them in the past , and the british have gone full cuckoo and have taken it inside their heads that the `` end of history '' crap was right and now it 's all trade and good feeling at the negotiating table . 
  we 're heading into perhaps one of the most naive generations ever to set foot on this earth , with no living history of repression or war , and an absolute arrogance as to their civilization heritage and their sense of exceptionalism regarding their ability to not fall back to old habits . 
  so , in my opinion , it 's best to not have high expectations . 
  why would you say that ? 
  we 're quickly forgetting everything and returning to pre-ww2 europe . 
  if you actually go to the search results it turn out most of the results come from people referencing the results in reddit , a right-wing blog complaining about black people on european book covers , and a pinterest list of '' ** people ** of colour in ** european ** art ** history ** '' , you know all the search terms together very close on an extremely popular image site . 
  still , i do n't mind that this get 's referenced now and then . 
  helps spot the nutters . 
  this logic only applies if russia has no desire to continue sanction worthy offenses later on . 
  if it does , then there is no reason to ever get them lifted . 
  in fact the sanctions can be said to `` force it 's hand '' into acting aggresively while removing a weapon from the hands of the west by virtue of simply accepting it as the status quo . 
  russian businesses will find new market , russian customers will find new businesses , and life will go on no matter what the west does . 
  we 've had governments that have survived for decades under international sanctions . 
  and with the rise of china and other powers , they simply do n't have the bite they used to have . 
  you see `` shoot themselves in the foot '' . 
  i see `` made the lack of trade with the west the new normal '' . 
  i do n't think the russian government wants this `` siege '' to be broken . 
  it 's too useful for internal politics , and i imagine local agricultural producers are n't entirely unhappy . 
  and you think you can somehow stop western companies from tempting them away ? 
  how , build a wall ? 
  arrest them if they try to leave ? 
  swiss french and swiss german still have distinct communities and customs after centuries of legal union . 
  you 're letting fear get the better of you . 
   i am british , i live in england and work alongside british people and for the majority of people i talk to ireland never even comes up in conversation . 
  they do n't care about you . 
  we do n't think ireland is n't fully seperated , we just blank you in favour of other countries . 
  which is a perfect foundation for ignorance do n't you think ? 
  it 's the same with most historical and international relations : you do n't think about it , and when you 're finally forced to think about it you have to default to the last cultural millieu you can draw upon which seems to be somewhere between the 1800s and 1945 . 
   if the dup can veto the irish sea being the border then there will be a border on the island . 
  if there is a border on the island then ireland has to work to minimise its impact , not say `` this is your mess '' to the uk .
