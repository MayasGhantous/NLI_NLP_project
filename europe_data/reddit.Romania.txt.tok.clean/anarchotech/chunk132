  that 's my point . 
  you think south stream was canceled because gazprom had a majority share ? 
  i 'm going to give you time to check on that , and edit your comment . 
  as for ns2 being illegal : [ it is n't ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/nord-stream-2s-opponents-look-for-legal-ammunition/ ) . 
  despite [ all attempts ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/e9894b38-095d-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43 ) . 
  sucks , i know . 
  and we 'll never win if we keep making these shitty , not-on-point economic arguments , because they do n't stand up to scrutiny . 
  [ merkel is absolutely thrilled is n't simply `` an economic project '' , she can push through ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-estonia-nordstream-idusb4n1g002d ) we need to make a political argument or shut up . 
  too optimistic by far , i 'd say . 
  i do n't vote for the mayor of sibiu or the majority of romanian mps either . 
  that 's how it works . 
  and before you get on the germany is the eu bullshit , what do you think happens if germany did n't have to obey eu law or have allies for eu votes ? 
  you think germany will simply cease to exist and we 'd all be making our own `` strong and independent '' decision like we did before the eu ? 
  really ? 
  the eu , the euro , and the eec before it was created to ** control ** germany . 
  and every time people like you forget it and start talking about `` less europe '' germany gets stronger , the way it got stronger when it walked into the eurozone meetings and realized there was n't any eu rapporteur or parliament that was watching it , and it can use it 's full economic weight to gets it 's way . 
   in that case though , are you in control of your own nation ? 
  through democracy and law . 
  the two things eu offers . 
  any nationalist illusion that these are n't enough and we should aim at `` true freedom '' is as delusional as the libertarian who cuts off the power and tries to live in the woods before a logging company shoots through and drives him off . 
  same mentality , same result , different scale . 
  it could collapse , or the next leader could make a point of strengthening his position by becoming even more aggressive . 
  the institutions behind putin are n't weak , the duma and the fsb are perfectly capable of putting their foot down if they find someone to back . 
  and do n't make the carthaginian mistake of underestimating an enemy bent on power . 
  there are institutions behind putin perfectly capable and willing of colluding and cooperating or the sake of more power . 
  their people are perfectly happy with the economic difficulty recently as long as the state looks stronger . 
  we 're dealing with romans here , in a way if you pardon the rough comparison . 
  the type of thinking that sees a defeat , and then send out another wave of men when other countries would have collapsed onto themselves , because `` fuck you '' . 
  they actually did , for a brief moment . 
  in 2012 the european parliament boycotted the council that was trying to `` solve '' the migration crisis by making setting up internal borders easier when italy first started letting them through . 
  but it stopped when it realized : no one cared . 
  and the eu can not order the member states around . 
  a majority of member states can order the rest around , but the eu itself has no army , no politicians , even the existence of the quota system inside brussels means that bureaucrats are employed based on their nationality . 
  the only power it has is the law , and that 's because europeans care about the law . 
  but it can not impose a political decision , even germany does n't want the eu to make political decision , schauble threatened the commission with destruction the moment it started having opinions on the greece bailout . 
  the eu is very much the end result of our own perceptions . 
  it 's ignorance is ours . 
  it was impotent , because we were impotent . 
  i am very much applying psychological stigma to the whole of the eu . 
  the far-right are n't wrong in one thing : there is a loose concept of european culture we all somewhat belong to . 
  and that culture is largely devoid of a sense of self-confidence outside of their isolationist traditionalist ethno-chauvanism which what is they use to appeal to people . 
  many of what we understand as `` our modern values '' , have strayed away from the humanist rationality and universalism of the 19th century onwards , and now only exist in opposition to the ur-fascism ( both leftist and right ) and other authoritarianism that we 've managed to abandon for a brief period . 
  we are lacking in the original intelectual framework we need to make new ideas . 
  we have no position on our own future , outside survival . 
  no concept of our own success except our economic well-being . 
  and this extends to romania , as much as it does to germany . 
  and having been told for the last ten years that `` crisis will make europe stronger '' , i 'll have to express skepticism that the lack of crisis will hold any solutions either . 
  the problem is us , we 're too scared . 
  stop looking at their wallet , and look into their eyes . 
  russia is unstable , but it 's unstable in the sort of mad dog way a pub drunk is unstable . 
  meanwhile we do n't know the us policy one year after another . 
  do you vote for us president , does any european ? 
  exactly , we 're not in control there , we 're blowing in the wind . 
  this is what i 'm generally talking about , this slave mentality . 
  either the us or russia . 
  either , or . 
  you ca n't imagine any other world besides serving a master for protection . 
  our goal should n't be to trust the european west . 
  but to ** bind ** the european west . 
  to make their prosperity , our prosperity . 
  their defense , our defense . 
  their industries , our industries . 
  to make our relationship so intertwined , our communal strength so large , that betrayal is unthinkable . 
  instead , in your syconphantic devotion to serve someone , you 're weakening us all . 
  hungary sides with russia , poland with the us , france takes a third path , germany plays it safe and tries to stay neutral , and everyone is too scared to do anything alone while the us and russia pick us up as vassal states who are ever so grateful for the attention . 
  and calling me a `` commie '' , and assuming i 'm a russian sympathizer . 
  pathetic attempt at the exact polarization the greater powers want from us . 
  either for , or against , no path of our own . 
  the eu officials are backing that `` unpopular policy '' because it won the vote . 
  if a new policy is brought up , and it wins the vote , then it 's going to back that one as well . 
  where is the v4 proposal on solving the refugee crisis . 
  note , not `` paying greece to hold them '' , but actually solving it . 
  answer : there is none . 
  that 's my point , the v4 ca n't imagine a world where they would have a policy on syrian war , or libyan government or stabilizing central africa . 
  their ability to hold an opinion on anything ends the next country over . 
  they do n't have the institutional and mental ability for it . 
  they need the us or russia to do something and then they can decide if they like it or not . 
  not that the refugee quota vote was done done properly . 
  it should have been given to parliament , it should have been given to commitee , the yellow card system should have been used . 
  but none of that happened . 
  you know why ? 
  there was no time . 
  because the strategy of the v4 , germany , everyone basically since 2012 to react to the increasing migration was : ignore it . 
  ignore it and it will go away . 
  none of our business . 
  and then the member states , in all their wisdom , decided at the last minute they did n't need all that `` europe '' and they can just have a meeting behind closed doors and sort it out themselves . 
  they lead entire countries , they can figure how to stop this , right ? 
  wrong . 
  europe simply does n't like making decisions . 
  it likes complaining . 
  oh god . 
  when you 're so sure what you 're doing is `` perfectly legal and above board '' , that you ca n't take the time to review the draft properly before voting it in . 
  my condolences . 
  but , think about it , exactly what does the eu have to do with the migration crisis ? 
  which eu institution has actually failed there ? 
  name one . 
  it 's not the eu that gave itself a bad reputation , it 's the same age old trick governments have used since day one : when facing your own failure , blame the eu . 
  it wo n't bite back . 
  i can pull a french defense white paper from 2007 saying : migration will inevitably become a bigger issue in a decade , but we 'll have a common eu asylum agency and eu border force to take care o it , we 'll need to figure how that is done . 
  where is that border force ?
