  these are not mutually exclusive positions , unlike in eastern europe , it 's just a hard position to take as a receiving country , which e.e is n't . 
  back in 2012 when the refugee crisis actually first started merkel was trying to keep them all in italy/greece , now that the dublin agreement is legally unenforceable due to human rights issues she has to bend to the german public 's will and ** not ** talk about putting them in camps , letting them drown or shooting them . 
  ideas that eastern politicians seem very comfortable with by comparison because ww2 never really had an effect on the eastern mentality regarding genocidal guilt . 
  so now she 's working on getting them back to africa without breaching human rights , and again that move is working on the german public who is willing to pay for it , again unlike eastern europe . 
  i do n't downvote anyone as a rule . 
  also , downvotes happen , toughen up . 
   first of all - the context when it could be changed is described in our constitution - you can do it only when specific circimstances are met .

  oh , let me guess , polish constitution article 180 , point 5 : `` where there has been a reorganization of the court system or changes to the boundaries of court districts , '' so all they have to do is do exactly what pis has done and reogranize everytjing to excuse a future ideological purge , just like pis is doing . 
   so it will be judges of compromise - not the pis one . 
  the sjem tried to pass simple majority system of selection by the parliament . 
  where the hell is the compromise there ? 
  especially when they control half the ksr , and appoint the other half . 
  and where is the compromise in the justice minister can appoint presiding judges and court presidents . 
  there is no compromise . 
  only lies . 
   it 's the way how it 's work in germany ? 
  is n't it ? 
  [ as someone pointed out  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6og63s/polish_lawmakers_pass_controversial_supreme_court/dkh4ej8/ )  firstly , context . 
  german legalisative/excutive have not refused to carry out a judgement from a high court . 
   secondly , the power to dismiss judges is reserved for 2/3 of the german parliament but this bill will allow the justice minister to make that decision on his own . 
   thirdly , removal of current justices , the bill removes current sitting justices at the same time it allows parliament , which is controlled by pis to appoint the new ones . 
  victims of this is prior judges who has ruled against pis . 
   fourth , in germany consensus is reached around the coming justices , so that it represents a both the opposition and the current government/majority leadership wishes . 
  so no , the ideological purge of every single judge the ruling party disagrees with is not considered very `` german '' . 
  in fact , `` soviet '' would be more apropriate . 
  will you say the same thing if a future government does the exact thing and purges all the judges pis appointed in one go ? 
  that it 's all in the name of better democracy ? 
  admittedly , hoping for a future government might be optimism at this point edit : btw , as germans keep telling you guys , they do n't allow the ruling party to replace all senior judicial positions with input only through the ruling party , especially not while arbitrarily dismissing them in one go . 
  what did you expect merkel to do , extricate herself from their dirty migrant clutches ? 
  understand merkel : she believes in nothing , she has no morals , she is a walking popularity poll that 's aiming for the next election . 
  the day after her so-called `` welcome '' announcement her government started working on making asylum conditions stricter and deporting the remaining yugo refugees . 
  merkel does everything for the cameras , she never acts like she 's loosing control even as she changes her position 180 , and she will gladly tell schauble to say and do the exact opposite so she can play every angle . 
  she 'll take pictures with refugees looking absolutely comfortable , and order them deported the next day over breakfast . 
  i despise the woman , but most non-germans do n't seem to truly get her for what she really is : a populist . 
  no it is n't . 
  it 's the basic principle of fom : it only applies to signatories of the fom area . 
  the uk is leaving fom , and there are no loopholes or visas capable of providing fom without eu/eea citizenship . 
  and since giving permanent residency does not extend to giving freedom of movement , here we are . 
  giving third country citizens freedom of movement without their state being signed into it would be undermining our position . 
  to begin with , the existance of schengen means that people can travel to other countries but they can not seek to make a living there , either by seeking work or benefits . 
  this is perfectly in line with the uk 's position on ending freedom of movement between it and the eu . 
  a position it is alone responsible for . 
  second , visa and immigration are a member state issues . 
  uk citizens are given the same rights in a member state that the eu citizens are getting inside the uk . 
  the eu can not give freedom of movement like qualities without giving eu/eea citizenship , and eu/eea citizenship is based on member state citizenship . 
  so the member states decide who gets that citizenship , and since eu citizens are n't being treated as uk citizens , that ends that . 
  you are asking for something which is n't possible without fom being restored . 
  the de facto head of nato has a scandal involving their administration being elected with the help of an aggressive power , while one of it 's members casually leaks information about military activities , and another is a home to foreign espionage in europe . 
  i 'd say that you 're thinking of a much different nato that simply is n't there anymore . 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted , it 's perfectly correct . 
  it 's a far weaker constitution than most since they exist as intergovernmental treaties , giving more power to the states involved to work outside of it 's framework , but it is in all practical terms a constitution . 
  oh please , do n't pretend like the streets of eastern europe are friendly places without crime . 
  `` modernization without westernization '' ? 
  right ? 
  like it ? 
  because i took it from a paper in an islamic journal on geopolitics about how the west is undermining islamic society and traditional values , and how islam should not accept western concept of democracy or law . 
  this is what you are to me : another form of fundamentalist . 
  you are generally a voice of reason in most threads . 
  oh please god no . 
  i am very much an angry , ranty person with a bone to pick with the world , hardly the voice of anything besides a repressed personality . 
  maybe , but that was the argument made by the hol . 
   the jurisdiction of the cjeu over the uk would also come to an end when the eu treaties ceased to have effect . 
  outstanding payments could not , therefore , be enforced against the uk in the cjeu . 
   it follows that , under eu law , article 50 teu allows the uk to leave the eu without being liable for outstanding financial obligations under the eu budget or other financial instruments , unless a withdrawal agreement is concluded which resolves this issue . 
   individual eu member states might seek to bring a case against the uk for the payments of outstanding liabilities under principles of public international law , but , as our witnesses explained , international law is slow to litigate and hard to enforce . 
  in addition , it is questionable whether an international court or tribunal could have jurisdiction . 
  article 344 tfeu prohibits eu member states from submitting the legal interpretation of the eu treaties to a court other than the cjeu, 
  the treaties refereed to in article 50 ( 3 ) as `` the treaties '' are the two main treaties of the european union as stated in the first paragraphs . 
  not ** all ** the agreements made while in the eu , just those two . 
  relevant line :  ` the union shall be founded on the present treaty and on the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( hereinafter referred to as `` the treaties '' ) . 
  those two treaties shall have the same legal value . 
  the union shall replace and succeed the european community . ' . 
  you 're dealing with a civil law system here . 
  there are no `` loose '' off the cuff interpretation you can make up . 
  article 50 removes you from the founding treaties of the european union . 
  but the mff agreement as well as the other funding promises remain . 
  and you 're right , it 's mostly a moral argument . 
  international law is an anarchic state of being and there is no police we can go running to . 
  so we 'll have to do what actors on the world stage usually do : find a way to make it hurt . 
  in common parlance : `` you ca n't make me pay it , so the legality does n't matter . '', 
  but of course , that does n't really make it unenforceable , just hard to . 
  the debt is there , the subsequent damage of reneging is there , and with those come consequences . 
  the hol concluded that the uk will be hard to bring to trial , not that it did n't owe money . 
  `` us fucking them over is your fault . 
  give us what we want and we 'll stop fucking them over , you scoundrel . '', 
  such a bully boy . 
   ireland and the uk are in agreement , they want no border . 
  it 's the eu who are forcing a border upon the two countries . 
  eu can cite what ever reasons it wants for wanting a border , it 's still them imposing it 's will on two non-consenting countries . 
  that 's a fairly self-serving interpretation . 
  what most people saw was the uk saying `` we want a border with the eu '' and then realizing ireland exists and saying `` and we want ireland to have one too so they can stay with us '' . 
  if you really did n't want a border without infringing on ireland 's right as a member state , then you should have stayed in the customs union at the very least . 
  but you did n't . 
   how lovely of you , belittling eu citizens anxieties and worries . 
  cunt . 
  i have family you turned into bargaining chips . 
  let me tell you a bit of their `` anxieties and worries '' between the home office giving them a 80 page form and not explaining what `` comprehensive health care '' means , while the country call them scum for daring to come to the uk to work and asking them to get out . 
   uk tried to settle the eu national issue almost straight away , yet the eu refused to say anything . 
  lovely eu showing disdain for it 's own citizens , again .
