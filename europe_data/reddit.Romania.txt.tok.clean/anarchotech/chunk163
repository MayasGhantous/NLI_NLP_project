  democracy has served as property insurance for their wealth . 
  but now we have political strongmen backed by rich bussiness and media partnership returning to telling the plebs what they should think and feel `` for the sake of their country and it 's traditions '' while they steal from them . 
  it was n't any sort of democracy . 
  the actual population had their rights abolished starting with the statutes of piotrk\u00f3w . 
  it was the same electoral monarchy you could see plenty of in central and eastern europe only better institutionalized . 
  and it does n't matter how long ago it was , the lesson is important : the rich and powerful who say they `` represent the country '' will grant themselves the rights to destroy it if they can . 
  it happened to the plc , it happened to the kingdom of hungary after the death of corvinus , it happened in romania with the exile of alexandru ioan cuza , and it happened in scotland with the act of union and the highland clearances . 
  we should never forget the realities of our histories , or as the saying goes , we will repeat them . 
   noblemen 's democracy it 's annoying how oligarchy and democracy is so confused . 
  same with the magna carta situation . 
  just because they get similar rights to what average citizens get today , does n't make it a democratic institution . 
  it still serves hereditary privilege . 
  also the szlachta as described in the video did not really see their allegiance to the country , despite whatever some might say . 
  plenty of confederations sought outside help against the plc institutions to protect their `` rights '' ( and priviledges ) . 
  the szlachta themselves were absolutely terrible for the actual country , the peasants and the burghers . 
  basically anyone who worked for a living but did not have military power and hereditary titles . 
  and when the new constitution actually came to even the skewed political situation , it was the szlachta which drove the final nail in the country 's coffin . 
  it 's an incredibly sad tale of selfishness destroying society , not the birth of a medieval democracy . 
  fuck the nobles and , in my humble foreign opinion , fuck this re-interpretive romanticism . 
  edit : fixes, 
   around 6,000 brown bears live in romania , making up 60 % of the european population . 
  that 's actually a bit depressing . 
  i have no love for them at all . 
  but since erdogan employed robert amsterdam , a lawyer specializing in media manipulation , to go after gulenist institutions after the coup i keep wondering if gulen is n't erdogan 's george soros , and maybe he is n't as influential or dangerous as we 're lead to believe despite being a shitty person with shitty beliefs . 
  maybe gulen is just another shadow puppet of an authoritarian government to rally people against . 
   then why did she call the snap election after triggering article 50 ? 
  since no one is apparently answering your question with anything else but vagaries ( `` calculated gamble '' my ass ) : just before the election there was a scandal brewing around campaign funding from the previous election . 
  this eventually managed to wing just one mp , but there were quite a few seats being investigated and the resulting by-elections and scandal might have done them harm as they had a small majority to begin with . 
  at the same time david davis seems to have been leading the brexiter wing of the party against may . 
  we caught glimpses of this during the juncker leaks and there were rumours of double-dealing in the cabinet . 
  it was possible that david davis was building a backbench alliance to force may 's hand when negotiations happened . 
  that minority needed to be neutralized since the majority of the conservative party is still the 2014 `` eurosceptic but remain for the money '' party at heart . 
  and that 's the things we know publicly . 
  there might have been more but that was behind closed doors . 
  i ca n't believe the number of british posters here who argue : strategy , hubris , all sorts of other non-sense when she was clearly pressured to do a u-turn on her previous stance of no sudden election , despite already having the majority she needed to do what she publicly promotes ( but privately fears ) : actual-exit brexit . 
  it 's a sign of how bad the tabloids have fucked the country 's head , the signal to noise ration is pitiful . 
   large conservative majority would mean so-called `` soft brexit '' , since majority of conservative mps are cautiously pro-eu . 
  it 's insane how in the uk they think the exact opposite . 
  no wonder they 're a mess , they ca n't even get their own politics right . 
  they also said they do n't want checks between n.i. 
  and the rest of the uk . 
  they 're on the side of `` the have your cake and eat it '' brigade , and when forced they 'll argue for a hard irish border than any uk checks . 
   if the coalition with the dup happens , soft brexit will be back on the table , so this is going to be interesting . 
  what makes you think the dup want a soft brexit ? 
  like the american 's could n't order us into iraq ? 
  i really wish people had more guile here . 
  without institutional framework , power balances and necesity determine relationships . 
  the `` independence '' is illusory . 
  it is now with the americans , it might be tomorrow with the germans . 
  considering our defense needs this translate to a historical well-practiced position : client state . 
  this is why i 'm a euro-federalist , because having done this a few dozen times i 'm willing to try something that does n't end badly for us . 
  apparently i 'm in the minority . 
  yes , yes . 
  we 're all incompatible machines . 
  practically from other planet . 
  not able to find an objective analysis and response . 
  got it . 
  do i have to repeat myself ? 
  the public is not an immutable rock . 
  it is responsive , reactive and more than often has the memory of a goldfish . 
  it has zero institutional memory , generally lacks a cohesive narrative and can be lead by a sufficiently dedicated message or government policy . 
  the gullible nigh-autistic numerological obsession that has taken up the public discourse among polls is ass backwards . 
  polls were used in marketing to judge the influence of an organization or event on the public , not to set strategy policy after it . 
  given the current circumstances at this point , that is the public opinion according to some random poll . 
  tomorrow it might be different . 
  neither matter , because we want the institutional support of the german state . 
  nope . 
  if it ever gets done it will be done in a few years or less and a lot of sleepless nights . 
  like pretty much every major political reform . 
  contrary to popular belief , political change is n't done on comfortable geological timescales . 
  because it does n't rely on a comfort factors as if the public is a bunch of easily startled sheep , it reacts on public will to achieve something . 
  once public will is set on a direction , the gears move at high speed . 
  you think the grand armee and new model army were a gradual process ? 
  they were the first of their kind and they were set up with genius and intent . 
  run news stories for a week about e coli in salads , and public polls will tell you that the greatest threat to public health is e coli in salads . 
  public polls are daft tools for policy making . 
  this is politics , it involves a bit more than a 50/50 split of opinion of the vox populi . 
   most news websites have even closed down their comment sections because they were getting too much hard hitting criticism . 
  no , they closed them because they were a shitshow . 
  but i 'm guessing the type of person you are by your interpretation of `` they 're trying to silence our criticism '' . 
  the comment section of an article is n't actually an avenue for news criticism mate . 
   read both sides and decide , do n't just read a biased source that pretends to be unbiased . 
  yup , king solomon himself . 
   such divides simply ca n't be bridged , the two positions are literally impossible to bring together . 
  this is what you say . 
  i do n't think this is true . 
  we 're far too easily manipulated by the americans to feign a solid position about our stances on the military . 
  and honestly , as much respect as i have for the french military , i think they need moderation as much as the `` neutrals '' need a dose of reality . 
   of course it 's not a proper system , it 's not intended to be . 
  it 's there to get things started because on practical terms the integration will take a long time and we may as well get some things out of the way . 
  if we wanted to get things started we 'd start by merging officer academies . 
  not brigades . 
   you could say it 's a bit like the euro . 
  yeah , that my worry . 
  no it 's not . 
  we already had this issue with our airforce , it makes us look daft . 
  especially inside the military and political structure since they look more closely at such things . 
  we need them up and moving simply for self-assurance that they are there . 
  but we ** do ** need tank numbers . 
  so we ** do ** need germany .
