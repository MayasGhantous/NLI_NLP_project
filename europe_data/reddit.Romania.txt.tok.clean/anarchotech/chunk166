  any company which refuses the ability to charge its customers to pay for this is and going against the grain is taking an instant hit in that environment . 
   customers who significantly benefit from free roaming will just move to companies or plans which provide free roaming . 
  only advantage they could gain with this move , would be if the roaming customers caused the companies net loss . 
  roaming free is a net loss for companies , over roaming , otherwise the `` invisible hand '' would have provided roaming free years ago . 
  simply put , the benefits of non-perturbed travel have not been enough to have customers change over , but the barriers need to come down to make decrease the friction of traveling and give system-wide benefits . 
  and hopefully put down the groundwork for a total dissolution of digital/electronic borders , which again is a net loss for current corporate models . 
  i know the `` laisez-faire '' folk do n't like this idea of trying to leverage regulation to achieve efficiency gains where lone customer decision collectively fail , but this is europe and it 's pretty much the bread and butter of our social democracies . 
  so let me guess , when policing is effective and under-budget the home office gets the praise . 
  but the moment shit hits the fan the local authorities have to carry the burden of implementing national anti-terrorist and policing policy using the nationally allotted budged . 
  tories should be called the `` having your cake and eating it '' party by now . 
  that 's a very naive view of the market . 
  over the long term we all benefit from crushing national silos , but over the short term companies that change the least can provide the cheaper service . 
  especially since we 're still running seperate companies per nation , despite most national companies being owned by european multinationals . 
  these exceptions pretty much bring us back to square one where companies put roaming fees , because everyone else is putting roaming fees and are charging each other for wholesale use depending on how much they can milk from the customer . 
  so basically , it does nothing . 
  loyal footsoldier of the nasty party engaging in mental tribalistic gymnastics to hide deep and worrying insecurities regarding the failures of his `` law and order '' government , that neither respects law nor can provide order . 
  trying to blame 2 local administration of the uk when policing is handled on a nation-wide basis is particularly `` special '' . 
  especially considering the mayor of manchester position is about 2 years old . 
  how about you take your left-right american like political spinery and keep it in your wee isle . 
  we do n't need this sort of point-scoring over the obvious failures of a bunk administration . 
  it will be a full decade in a month since the first piece of legislation to make this happen was passed . 
  and 15 years since the first policy paper to end national barriers on electronic communication was published and approved . 
  at this point patience is verging on gullibility . 
  it is literally the power to over-rule eu law on a national level , gained by national governments after negotiations , with a paper-thin justification with no outside supervision since it 's up to the national regulator and only the national regulator to decide what is sustainable and when to remove the exception . 
  this is after the same member state governments [ delayed ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/article/eu-roaming-charges ) the abolishing of fees , again to protect their domestic telecom industries from making less profits due to the industry being `` unprepared '' for a piece of legislation that 's been slowly been implemented for over a decade . 
  it 's not a loophole . 
  it 's national government giving themselves the power to overrule eu law , then using it to fuck everyone over . 
  we saw the same thing during dieselgate , when national regulators swore up and down that they can do car testing , and no eu-wide agency would be needed . 
  the bundestag even went [ so far ] ( https://euobserver.com/dieselgate/137803 ) as to declare their government innocent and blame `` lax '' eu laws for it . 
  all hail `` sovereignty '' . 
  a lot of exceptionalism in your post . 
  almost every country in europe have been dictatorships centered around the great leader until extremely recently , russia and turkey are n't great exceptions . 
  and i highly doubt your country in particular has some magical power that prevents home grown extremism . 
  although , please do n't tell me your country is hungary because between the police 's confrontation with istv\u00e1n gy\u0151rk\u00f6s of the mna , the bomb in budapest , and jobbiks steady popularity and their band of black shirts , it would be incredibly disingenuous of you to say that . 
   just look at how the media and social sites are policed and dissenting opinions are suppressed all over western europe are you talking about the hate speech issues . 
  because you know that 's partially against the very extremists of a foreign ideology you 're talking about . 
  it 's just incredibly hard to tell one prick from another when it comes to extremist demagoguery . 
   i value `` independent judiciary and free media '' ( both of which have never really existed anyway ) far less than not fearing for my own life because my government is a bunch of impotent losers unable to stand up for their people . 
  yeah , i get it . 
  willing to trade a bit of liberty for a bit of security . 
  nothing ever changes . 
   i 'm ok to apply it to `` every nutter with a holy book '' . 
  the part of european history when those got to control everyday life have been over for quite a while now and it should stay that way . 
  not even close . 
  detoothed and beaten , forced to give ground after the loosing fascist and feudal allies , but it 's still there especially in the east where culture , ethnicity and religion bleed into each other . 
  we 're all just a few bad apples away from joining the rest of the middle east . 
   however , `` illiberal authoritarian muppet '' seems like a more subjective term , especially going from the modern , `` progressive '' definitions ( i.e. 
  everyone who does not agree with me is a fascist dictator ) . 
  please , this whole `` the truth is relative '' , `` political terms are subjective '' non-sense is a smoke screen . 
  especially when we have governments who actually call themselves `` illiberal '' . 
  and it might suit some nicely to confuse the `` unpleasable pc/multiculti brigade '' with those arguing for independent judiciary and free media , by labelling both `` progressive '' . 
  but the reason we 're different from every broken democracy south and east of europe is because we hold liberal values sacred , liberal values which are old and well-worn through centuries of revolution . 
  you can claim subjectivity all you want on the definition . 
  but watch the slow totalitarianism of russia and turkey , and tell me it is n't real . 
  looking at polybius for justifications is forgetting who polybius was and who he was serving . 
  and it 's funny how the romans did n't become ambitious until ** after ** they defeated the major power on the balkan peninsula , ** after ** they started taking hostages from their former ally there to keep them controled , ** after ** they destroyed the capital when they rebelled against the vassalage , and ** after ** they installed an occupation government . 
  was that not ambition to you up to that point ? 
  but that aside , what aggressive actions in syracuse ? 
  syracuse and carthage were actually allied against rome . 
  and the `` actions '' were putting down a rebellion similar to the one rome put down in rhegium , across the straight , just a few years before . 
  you know before rome took over all the greek colonies in southern italy , not out of ambition of course , but because they were `` forced '' to take them over :p . as for the word `` forced '' . 
  when the senate is split over what to do , i do n't think you can use the word forced . 
  rome was the clear aggressor in the dispute and any attempts at justification are self serving attempts to feed the self-perceptions they needed as `` honourable individuals '' . 
  roman 's elite was good at that , always finding an offense they can leverage into a just war . 
  does slovakia not count because it has the euro or something ? 
  more than fair , too kind . 
  roman elite 's realpolitik and diplomatic manipulation were works of genius , but they were cutthroat . 
  carthage vs rome all over again . 
  rome did n't care about money . 
  rome did n't care about trade . 
  rome did n't care about grain . 
  rome wanted power , and destroyed anyone in the way . 
  came the fires to carthage , corinth and capua so that they never deny it . 
  same here . 
  putin is not like the 1990s politicians , he genuinely believes in the politics of power . 
  the duma no longer just get payed off by the oligarchs , they run the oligarchs as a protection racket and grab their take . 
  this is not your daddy 's russia , this is the old imperial beast . 
  so stop thinking like carthage , and realize who you 're facing . 
  they 're not gon na stop short of salting the earth . 
  yeah , that 's all it takes . 
  someone to break it , and nothing to happen . 
  the moral high ground of not breaking it first is a worthless self-congratulatory trinket . 
  thing still is broken . 
  a state refusing to participate in common defense in a united eu would be the equivalent of bavaria , texas , bihar or bern refusing to honor a call to arms . 
  unthinkable . 
  all your arguments against unity are better suited for the current structure of nato and all it 's failings . 
  i 'm honestly not surprised you ca n't see a european army operating any differently than nato , operating as a cohesive force , because otherwise we would n't have this argument . 
  as you face turkey continuing to undermine the toilet-paper treaties , and trump anger everyone as he bullies his allies into paying for us protection , i hope you realize the hollowness of the argument against cohesion . 
  nato is a weak institution who could only borrow strength from american military might and the fear of from the rest of it 's members . 
  an institution run by strength and fear , rather than due process and procedure is bound to fail . 
   gee , when you slap an eu flag on the tanks the german public will be much more willing to send their troops to die in estonia than they are as nato members / s. 
  i do n't see how the eu can offer a security guarantee that 's more `` concrete '' than the papers and agreements that regulate nato . 
  your only hope seems to be that others are as insipidly daft as you are . 
  european tanks under european commanders with european center giving european orders , no matter their nationality is more than a bunch of flags on machinery . 
  it 's the beginning of genuine inter-dependence and by default security . 
  when the american chain of command and completely ignore the french chain of command , and give independent and contradictory orders from the romanian chain of command . 
  that is chaos and betrayal . 
   i do n't have an agenda . 
  it 's obvious to me , and has been for a while , that the global political framework established after wwii is falling apart . 
  and your response to this is to stick to the old order like a tick to a dieing horse ?
