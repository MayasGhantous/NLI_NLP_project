  we 've had nokia try to set up a factory in cluj what must be a decade ago . 
  in three years it went from `` we 're bringing it thousands to jobs '' to `` we 're closing down shop and leaving 2.200 unemployed '' . 
  skepticism is the right attitude to have with these `` hard and fast '' corporate systems . 
  they tell you what you need to hear , when you need to hear it , and do what they want when they want it . 
  right now , they might be trying to prevent talent leaking outside the company while they 're poaching off the necessary tools , people and intellectual property . 
  who knows how the situation is going to look like for gorhmann in a few years time , but i suspect some sort of restructuring towards their `` center of operation '' in the states . 
  packaging brussels , soros and immigration together into a neat little conspiracy . 
  i 'm impressed how they 're weaving this . 
  not impressed by how blunt it is , but it 's propaganda not an oscar film . 
  edit : i wonder if the epp politicians that let orban off the hook yesterday feel like idiots yet ... or they 're just numb to the feeling by now . 
  to be fair , their attempts to climb out of that r&d hole in the form of the n9 was aborted in favor of a quick corporate coup and pay out . 
  i only became aware of the conditions there during their `` winding down '' , when people 's purpose and jobs were under a constant question mark . 
  did n't know that their mistreatment of subcontractors had a deeper history . 
  where are you from ? 
  germans flying german flags outside of a sport event ? 
  wow . 
  either way , that sort of shrill nationalism does n't really fly well . 
  i mean , we 're speaking english ( a foreign language as far as i 'm concerned ) on an international board , we 're past that . 
  what matters is getting the investment , contracts and technology transfers going . 
  in the 90 's ? 
  everywhere . 
  because of trade barriers and lack of investment western companies had big advantages and could use local employment numbers in the west to have their governments manage better conditions for them . 
  only when we joined the eu did we start seeing stable acquisitions and more extensive contracting . 
  but we 're still far away from regrowing the necessary mittelstand necessary to work outside the political pressures of the west , like when big companies outright move factories forcing western governments to act like we saw recently in france . 
  and to do that we 'll require a lot of legislative and financial intervention to allow `` start-ups '' to appear without people selling them off again . 
  considering we 're also seeing chinese companies practicing the same thing that musk is doing , i 'm very critical of the concept of `` owner is king '' . 
  to prevent what happened in ee to happen in the rest of europe , a more hands-on approach to industrial development is needed as we 've seen with the very successful airbus and arianespace models . 
  no , what happened in ee was the companies got bought off by competitors , dismantled , equipment sold or moved , and the workers laid off allowing their buyers to sell foreign-made products in the market at higher prices based from the already heavily industrialized and modernized western regions . 
  the workers had to accept unemployment or to move to the west to get their jobs back as a result . 
  so what i 'm saying comes with a gram of personal experience in how `` i own it and so have full control '' works in real life . 
  i 'm not so , to better understand , it 's fallen for the `` technology will save us '' cult , with the added corporate fanboyism that goes with it ? 
  that 's kind of disappointing . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i do n't think that 's the kind of place anybody here wants to live in . 
  whatever you do , whatever you own , everyone has a final responsibility to society . 
  it might be their property , but if society sees destructive behavior happening it can and has the moral responsibility to at least comment if not outright intervene . 
  we 've seen what happened in nokia , why allow it to happen anywhere else ? 
  i do n't think you realize that this is pretty much a death sentence to grohmann . 
  you do n't recover in industry from this , industrial clients are n't as fickle as consumers , they need to deal with the same people for a decade or more , so they need stability . 
  from this point on , grohmann 's only future is either to be completely subsumed into tesla and operations torn apart or fail if tesla fails . 
  either way , it 's one company that no longer exists . 
  germany is the manufacturing engine of europe for a reason . 
  shit like this is n't done , it 's monopolistic behaviour that works against the mittelstand . 
  it 's always strange than when europeans discuss this , they compare the idea to the usa , rather than the nearby multi-cultural , multi-lingual federation switzerland . 
  i mean , i get it . 
  switzerland works without turning into a centralized homogeneous blob and has managed to defend itself and it 's neutrality through ww2 . 
  it undermines a lot of arguments by simply existing , but that does n't mean that people should get away with ignoring it . 
  or northern england when you think about it . 
  the whole `` economic recovery '' angle has turned out to be `` london is doing better , plebs rejoice '' , considering how austerity is still being implemented . 
  we ca n't actually keep it secret . 
  if we try , there will be a news leak in a day with `` secret eu plan to annex northern ireland '' stamped on the headline . 
  transparency is the best policy considering . 
  and considering they have n't had a problem since the good friday agreement , which still stand , why whine about it now ? 
  because they ca n't boogeyman the eu like in scotland or something ? 
  this is honestly between the uk and irish government , the eu is simply not standing in the way . 
  they all are the ones most interested in keeping the status quo , or as close as possible . 
  surprisingly enough , they are acting as if the eu does indeed recognize the possibility of `` scabs '' . 
  you 'd think the political naivete we keep showing would n't allow for that , but apparently there is a sense that we do n't want to loose to a divide and conquer tactic . 
  you 're mistaking this for a top-down union , which it has never been . 
  the `` planning '' is actually extended negotiation and compromise from it 's members being delivered haphazardly . 
  members are making preparation for brexit , and since it 's pointless to hide anything in the eu apparatus to begin with , you 're all getting a play by play update of the results . 
  yesterday , metaphorically , some country or other made a grab for the ema , the day before spain managed to get itself a mention on gibraltar . 
  and today ireland got a unification guarantee . 
  these things will happen , and the day that you find out is likely the day it was agreed on , not some tactical ploy . 
  edit : the fact your media spins it otherwise is , honestly , another matter . 
  then they are taking things far too personally , which is unprofessional . 
  like i said , this has always been the position of ireland . 
  in many ways nothing has changed . 
  you are taking things far too personally . 
  the eu is supposed to represent the interests of its member states . 
  since ireland has expressed openly a position of pro-reunification , for the better part of a century in fact , lacking any other counter-interest from another member , that has become the position of the eu . 
  this is n't a directed attack of any sort , merely the logical rebalancing of eu geopolitical considerations as part of it 's changed make-up . 
  we dont ** need ** a civil war . 
  it 's just a natural result of the conflicts between decentralists and centralists . 
  pl commonwealth and kingdom of hungary had simillar with the minor nobility . 
  it 's just a pattern .

  pl commonwealth and kingdom of hungary had simillar with the minor nobility . 
  it 's just a pattern . 
  the us and switzerland struggled with integration and both had to fight a civil war . 
  germany and italy did n't but had tremendous international pressure , and still have issues with it to this day . 
  it looks like it 's a natural part of how states are formed . 
  simicska offered a lot of money and the current owner wants to buy a house in vienna and not deal with this any more ? 
  i do n't think you realize how much they were willing to give and how much criticism they received for it . 
  cameron was really pushing the line . 
   you mean montenegro , and it 's not all clear about that incident , in any case it 's fishy . 
  yeah , mistake on my part . 
   and they 're backing the serbia-kosovo dispute literally as much as spain , greece or romania do since they do n't recognize kosovo either . 
  the amount of military cooperation suggest a closed and coordinated relationship . 
  and with the new administration , pro-russian support and anti-kosovar stunts have grown in proportion . 
   also , i 'm more or less thinking about some desperate east european here that is scared about the eu falling apart because it would mean there is nobody to pay for their roads in their corrupt countries . 
  every comment chain with a dutch poster ends with this . 
  y' all just seem to enjoy lording it over people . 
  your companies buy our land , you keep us out of schengen , and you sabotage eu anti-corruption fights , but that 's not enough . 
  you need to remind us that you spent the last 50 years between the 3 big economies in europe and enjoyed it . 
  is this a cultural trait ? 
  do you go to your poorer neighbors and remind them you paid for the road in front ? 
  then why do his ministers come out during the meetings stalling procedure and complaining that no more needs to be done ? 
  why did the dutch presidency turn out to be the presidency of `` let 's try to set a record for the least amount of legislative work in eu history '' ?
