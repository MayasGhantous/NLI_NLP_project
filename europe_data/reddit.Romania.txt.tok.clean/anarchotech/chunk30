  honestly , leveraging security to get a trade deal is no better than leveraging eu citizens to get a trade deal . 
  it 's a desperate scramble for a bargaining chip . 
  i 'm inclined to agree with gianni pittella . 
  if the uk decided to refrain from warning about a terrorist attack because we did n't allow them to sell us un-tarrifed fish , then it says plenty about what the uk thinks about people 's lives vs money . 
  you can call it entitlement . 
  i like to call it human values . 
   poland is pretty close to being a net contributer poland is nowhere near becoming a net contributer . 
  it has one of the lowest net contributions in the eu , second only to greece . 
  and i 'm sure political landscapes will change . 
  the current government is already laying the groundwork for future europhobia . 
  i suspect we 'll see a lot of cries for leaving among the v4 the moment they reach net . 
   yeah , well ... no one ever said politicians were smart , or did what made sense even half the time well politicians are elected . 
  and if the population shows a perpetual lack of critical thinking , then you get denmark opting out of eurojust and then begging to be allowed to atleast sit in the same room as everyone else to atleast pretend . 
  as for the extradition thing , it 's already an issue under the european arrest warrant . 
  ironically , having a public prosecutor to regulate inter-member usage of such instruments would be grand , but clearly not something people want because ... reasons . 
  they 're a government who experienced two such `` let 's try anyway '' projects after eurozone and schengen integration were sidelined due to chronic objectors , and found itself defending everyone 's borders and bailing out other people 's banks . 
  italy has since tried to push for more integrated eurozone and border projects and of course , the answer is n't more europe . 
  the ship has been sabotaged . 
  and right now we have people celebrating this as a `` triumph of voluntary cooperation '' rather than the obvious disaster it will be just like every other project the intergovermentalists neutered . 
  the eu needs to get it 's act together . 
  this initiative might help get its act together . 
  but it ca n't do it until it gets it 's act together . 
  circular arugment , repeat ad nauseam . 
  and is the `` eu has grown to large '' argument actually based on actual reality ? 
  prevalent does n't mean correct . 
  the actual problem is that the eu has fallen victim to the tragedy of the common , as everyone swears up and down that they can regulate themselves , which they do n't , and they can cooperate without law or institutions , which they ca n't , and they blame the eu when their `` europe of nations '' utopia falls apart from infighting and inneptitude . 
  just like every such union all the way back to the achean league . 
   but at the same time the step-by-step process is more useful than not joining an organisation that can do some good and will now happen with or without your support . 
  like schengen , or like the eurozone ? 
  i think italy has wised up that the european project has reached critical paralysis and no longer pretends it can be a half way house between those that want effectiveness and those that regurgitate `` muh sovereignty '' . 
  why bother even trying ? 
  one day a member will ignore the abuse of eu funds , and we 'll be powerless to stop it . 
  the same way poland and hungary got off the hook on rule of law . 
  this could have been our tool for dealing with it , and it 's now useless . 
  like a police force , like a judge , like anything in civil society this is n't for ** you ** , it 's for those that do n't comform with the law . 
  you might not kill somebody , but somebody else might . 
  that 's how it works . 
  you 've just sided with criminals being left unprosecuted , by the logic of you 're an honest person so why bother . 
  and of course , you proceed to blame the eu for not trying hard enough to show the idiocy of that position . 
  not everything is a bloody popularity contest !, 
  some things are a matter of common sense . 
  not good news at all . 
  this will be just like eurozone and schengen . 
  a bunch of states want to move forward , another bunch whinge that they do n't want to and they can veto so suck it . 
  so the ones that want it have to do the best they can , and wait until the eventual disaster that this was done to mitigate happens and those stuborn states will feel smug about having torpedoed everything . 
  i 'm talking about the cohesion funding . 
  when this bullshit blows up because of half-baked it is , when a state decides it does n't need to prosecute anyone and can ignore community law , i bet you 're going to be the first to blame the eu . 
  not sweden who layed the groundwork , not the netherlands which sided with poland and hungary , but the eu . 
  because that 's how you wash your hands clean of the naivety shown . 
  they will still get eu funding . 
  poland and hungary get massive amount of it and opted out . 
  if someone is missusing the cohesion funds there who stops them ? 
  the hungarian government who benefits from looking away ? 
  we now have a opt-out justice system . 
  you do n't like the charges against you , simply decide they do n't apply to you . 
  that 's like asking what is the point of a police force if someone can defend themselves . 
  police forces , by that logic , should be voluntary . 
  so you want to see a place where some states gets policed and observed properly , but it 's all voluntary so some states can just refuse and missuse eu funds ? 
  why in the name of anything sensible is this something you want ? 
  it 's becoming pretty clear that either the debt talks break down or the turkish deal breaks down by then . 
  either way , a huge fuss will be made , greece will get another public image hit , and we go through the exact same procedure we 've done every year for the last 7 years . 
  so do n't count chickens before they 're hatched . 
  no , the sad day will be when the member states do what they always do and fold when pressured . 
   from today onward brexit gets real , ** facts are what will count ** you really are an optimist . 
  i 'm fairly russophobic and from here i do n't see a lot of actual support happening . 
  what i see is a lot of empty rethoric , and internal control . 
  excuse me for dialing up my paranoia with party leader kaczinsky in charge . 
  and the kaliningrad thing sounds like just another stunt move . 
  meanwhile russia has moved missiles there , and they do n't require visas to travel . 
  this is where an attitude of pandering gets you . 
  that attitude allowed the efta members in together with their demands for exceptions , that attitude gave thatcher the rebate , and that attitude kept making compromises all the way through the eastern expansion until everything started falling apart . 
  try to please everyone , and you end up pleasing no one and going bust . 
  like all political changes , they look far more dauting and immense before they happen . 
  after , people 's perspectives whiplash and what was once unthinkable turns into the new status quo . 
  pis might declare a meeting with putin tomorrow , and their critics will be balanced out by their die-hard supporters . 
  they do n't need a majority , they just need to muddy the waters enough until apathy kicks in . 
   they rarely are shitty these days . 
  the last playboyish monarch died a long time ago . 
  modern kings and queens begin their regin while being 40 or 50 years old , they are mature , well educated and experienced by this time . 
  the spanish royal family comes to mind . 
  no offence to spaniards . 
   president is just another divisive politician , while monarch serves as a living symbol for his nation . 
  the president is someone we ellect . 
  he is the living symbol of our nation by virtue of the nation choosing him . 
  a monarch is the equivalent of a lottery ticket . 
  one that has to be payed for yearly to live in luxury . 
  that 's why i 'm surprised . 
  pis , once you forget its rhetoric , looks more like a russian trojan horse than actually interested in the security or well-being of poland . 
  the only times it even mentions russia is when it tries to weaken its political enemies , or justify creating its own paramillitary force . 
   if you 're always going to be picking fights and being the loudest person in the room then maybe we do n't want you , you know ? 
  honestly , considering the many `` eurosceptic '' governments doing that exact thing right now it seems like it 's the norm , turkey wo n't stand out . 
  honestly surprised . 
  will the pis government have a measured response that takes into account the interests that are looking to the divide them ? 
  or will they milk this to further their domestic political agenda by fighting with everyone around them ? 
  just , no . 
  there are some pretty shitty royal families out there , and we do n't need more central figures of authority in our history . 
  that and the semi-presidential system has served us well . 
   i 'd like to point out europe dragged the us into libya , so it 's not all one sided . 
  that 's a bit of a side note , we were talking about barriers . 
  although i consider that yet another dysfunction of our hydra-headed foreign policy .
