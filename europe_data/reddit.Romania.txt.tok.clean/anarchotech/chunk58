  that 's 7 different types , right off the bat . 
  welcome to the nightmare . 
  i do n't think you understood the scale of how fucked up we are until now . 
  and 90 % of the population will realize as well when our armies are hit with a eurozone/schengen crisis event . 
  from a strategic point of view , since estonia shares the same threat probability as the rest of nato , due to the defence alliance , then it shares strategic considerations with the rest of the baltics . 
  what we have right now is shared statregic considerations without shared planning . 
  the same we have same monetary union without shared fiscal planning . 
  and shared borders without shared border control . 
  yay , intergovermentalists . 
  yeah , you do n't get it . 
  this chart is about the types of equipment we maintain under operational readiness . 
  meaning we train on it , we store ammo and parts for it , and we expect to fight on it . 
  it does n't matter where it comes from , or who developed it , or how old it is . 
  what matters is that we 're wasting resources maintaining them to combat readiness as part of the main force . 
  the point is that those combined logistic problems end up like a byzantine mess , and this chart shows the scale of that mess . 
  i mean , it makes sense . 
  if you 're doing open bidding , then cheapest wins . 
  and labor in eastern and southern europe is cheap . 
  i 'd dare say , we might even see eastern europe take over the defense industry as a result . 
  `` use our own equipment against us ? 
  hah , more fool you !, 
  we 're out of ammo and parts for it , good luck keeping it running . 
  or any of the other 10 different tanks . '', 
  and for a short while , we 'll feel very clever . 
  until we run out of tanks . 
  i think you 've completely missed the point of the chart . 
  you 're seeing these industries as national . 
  but airbus shows that we can actually expect more multinational european industries . 
  it wo n't be a german manufacturer making the tanks . 
  it will be a manufacturer with one branch in france , another in poland , another in hungary , and maybe a hq in germany . 
  i do n't think there is any advantage . 
  if we learned anything from the german army in ww2 , the more weapon systems you have , the more you turn your army into a logistics nightmare . 
  spare parts , ammunition , training , variety of optimum operation conditions . 
  just so much more that can go wrong . 
  the us sherman served as a contrast . 
  not the best by far , but consistent and numerous , and in the end victorious . 
  we did n't ask for any of this . 
  in fact , we were in denial over where everything is going until ukraine and the refugee crisis . 
  and i 'd argue still are . 
  do n't spoil it , some of us are still at season 1 . 
  if the refugee crisis should teach us anything is that , over a long enough period of time , everything becomes our problem . 
  europe is not an hermetic environment . 
  i know that we like to flaunt our `` cynical geopolitics '' credentials here , when this comes up , but an important question needs to be asked : why ? 
  intelligence agencies have a nasty habit of turning a bit rogue , and the bnd has to give good reasoning why it considered spying on journalist necesarry for national security . 
  considering this , going : `` duh , why even bother mentioning it ? '', 
  is incredibly short sighted and misses the point of the exercise . 
  [ current interest rates ] ( http://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/central-banks/central-banks.aspx ) countries with equal or lower interest rates than the ecb : switzerland , denmark , sweden , japan . 
  the first three actually going negative . 
  [ reason  ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32284393 ) to get inflation back on track , and actually get money back in the economy . 
  has an inquiry on this been done before ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/62c513c6-07b4-11e6-a623-b84d06a39ec2 ) . 
  by germany giving the exact same reasoning . 
  so why repeat it ? 
  because the current dutch parliament is trying to score cheap political points . 
   higher freeboard means a less stable ship . 
  more weight up higher means a higher center of gravity . 
  a ship needs a low center of gravity to keep from capsizing . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  although i 'm unsure if the weight distribution inside was done evenly enough that the freeboard was a good indicator of center of gravity . 
  edit : reading up on it , the variability regarding weighting , as well as the effect of downfloading suggests otherwise . 
  this is europe . 
  we ignore anything more than one country away . 
  except belarus , which everyone ignores equally . 
  i have n't seen anything to suggest that . 
  you 're talking about the hull , and more specifically the freeboard , i imagine . 
  apparently civilian ships during the age of sail shared the same trait . 
  higher freeboard means a more stable ship , than can handle rough sees better with a drier deck . 
  i imagine construction limits also had a hand in a preference for deeper over longer ships . 
  but the length really took off for warships for two reasons : 1 . 
  it 's harder to board a taller ship . 
  as other have said , more cannons . 
  it was a numbers game , and height would usually win . 
  unless you were fighting thomas chocrane the sea wolf  . 
  in which case , make sure to not put your cannons higher than the ship you 're trying to fight . 
  also high prevalence of suicides , street folk , criminals and those working dangerous jobs . 
  there 's been several . 
  almost every time the `` justice and home affairs '' meet .

  oh , you get used to it . 
  brits keep posting about how little they care about romania all the time . 
  they must really , really not bother with us considering how much effort they put to remind us . 
  but we get it . 
  it 's the nature of compromise . 
  people want to have their cake and eat it too , and `` but sovereignty '' faction always gets some concessions so they do n't throw a tantrum . 
  it works fairly well as things get patched up , but apparently every few decades they start winning and push `` the answer is n't more europe '' . 
  it happened during the long period of eurosclerosis after degaul 's little stunt , and it 's happening again now that new members have come with zero institutional memory of the luxeumburg compromise years . 
  sooner or latter , all the sensible people will have enough of the europe of nations faction , dump them like a bad date , make a new treaty , and we can set ourselves up for the next repetition 2 decades down the line . 
  [ all this happened before , and shall happen again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6boy3rnywme ), 
  because every one expected that when shit hit the fan , the goodness of their humanity would shine through and they 'll band together and help each other without any mechanism in place to organize things or force adherence . 
  intergovernmentalists are dreamers . 
  the things is , as others have pointed out , the border states insist they can handle it when there is n't a crisis . 
  and since there is only ever a crisis involving 1 or 2 border states at a time , nothing is ever done as everyone thing it will never happen to them . 
  [ here 's reference material if you need it ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/world/germany-chides-europe-about-balkan-refugees.html ) learned it from a talk by an eu representative at the local university . 
  you 've never seen defeatist optimism until you see a eu rep. 
   by hungary . 
  for a few weeks in 2015 . 
  not relevant at all in the grand scheme . 
  not really by hungary . 
  the hungarian government just arranged it in such a way that it would be suspended .
