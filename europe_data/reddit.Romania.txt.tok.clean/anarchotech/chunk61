  it does n't help that our armies were `` russified '' during communism , which means a lot of bullying and corruption is embedded in it , not to mention the equipment shortages that turn specialist roles into a bit of a joke . 
  i know people want to feel proud of their armed forces , but our armies have suffered just as much as our society has from the warsaw pact period and the resulting kleptocracy afterward . 
  nope . 
  if you think something like that gets done within less than 2 years of constant committee meetings , let alone overnight with a veto hanging , you clearly do n't know the eu . 
  not to mention that a direct tax by the eu is almost impossible , even the current ftt model has governments keeping the revenue . 
  btw , the reforms got through anyway . 
  by turning them into the equivalent intergovernmental setup , like schengen and the eurozone . 
  and we know how that goes . 
  i can only find a limited report on his speech to the duma on [ 1tv . ru ] ( http://www.1tv.ru/news/2017-02-22/320429-v_ramkah_pravitelstvennogo_chasa_v_gosdume_vystupil_glava_minoborony ) but he did make a point of talking of a new information task force . 
  i 'm cyrillic deficient so someone else has to trawl to get the full speech . 
  you mean poorer ? 
  or less developed ? 
  smaller is not the right word . 
   the eu still has n't recovered because of the retarded decision which was austerity . 
  the us economy is already recovered . 
  i do n't have time for fighting the narrative anymore . 
  believe whatever . 
  that actually makes no sense . 
  you 're thinking like russia is predictable and clear cut , or that russia is out only potential threat . 
  floods are predictable and clearcut , and you know what , i 've seen governments be overwhelmed by floods due to poor planning year after year . 
  a smart opponent , with significant military experience and geopolitical ambitions . 
  that 's not only unpredictable , but it 's the stuff history is made of . 
   look at the brexit for example , it 's the eu that wants the uk out of the common market , not the other way around . 
  common market means the labour market as well . 
  that 's the eu 's stance . 
  britain does n't want that , it wants protectionism where it 's convenient . 
  how is that the eu 's fault ? 
   the uk was n't really against integration , it was on the fence about it with a very slight lean towards it it literally vetoed the fiscal compact for no other reason than because it was against integration . 
  the leaked polish tapes pretty much denounce cameron for fucking everyone up for no reason . 
   the uk would rather pilot deeper integration in the richer countries there is no foundation of truth for saying this . 
  by an inch or by a mile , second is second . 
  i 'm not in a position to go on and on about it , but i disagree . 
  i think it 's a sand castle , and the union in general has failed every security , diplomacy and intelligence test that it had to deal with , when the genuine article comes , we 'll all fall over like a house of cards . 
  all of them :p , there 's no shortage . 
  i 'm getting tutored so that conversation can happen every few minutes . 
  but i can tell you the most embarrassing example : t\u00f6rp\u00e9k . 
  the amount of repetitions to get that right was silly . 
  also , i have to take a running start to pronounce `` gy\u00f6ny\u00f6r\u0171 '' or anything like it . 
  long vowels , next to short vowels , paired with ny/gy/ly sound . 
  it 's a psychological distance . 
  the eu is crippled with it , as foreign ministries consider their own immediate neighbors not the union 's immediate neighbours . 
  pretty much why the ring of fire spread around us over the last decade . 
  heh , i know the history . 
   personally would prefer a eu army . 
  but honestly , would feel better about increased german military spending if there were fellow nationals in the regular brigades . 
  the metric was growth by percentage . 
  size does n't matter . 
  why not ? 
  [ this is what i found from 2014 for the whole of nato ] ( https://www.ncia.nato.int/documents/employment/salaryscales2014.pdf ) for more detail for 2016 : [ bundeswehr ] ( https://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/start/streitkraefte/soldaten/besoldung_versorgung/besoldungstabelle/!ut/p/z1/hu5nc4iwgp4thbzufves67yoipaqkas7xnq1revkltfpz-gwsc_t-eqbbhmwlg-n5lbrlvcjz9n8vi7inpaxvp_uj4h0eyzbekwd3cgc_gxyaomekejsccjhjcx0rggjmgbxpvan6bsxsljcy_ddygvevkocdek_wh6yvlr4xkdteuqsmbexyyqhdzpktbvdv_lqq-cckvpljuipyepm4a9srxsl2xcwunvmmajvenpzc6zp-vu!/dz/d5/l2dbisevz0fbis9nqseh/#z7_b8ltl2922tjr00ad5seart30h5 ) and [ armed forces ] ( http://www.armedforces.co.uk/armypayscales.php ) tl ; dr : pay is roughly equivalent as of now . 
  also noteworthy , the eurozone beat the us for 2016 as well . 
  brexit happened . 
  the common regulatory frameworks are set for untangling , with cheerful glee from the island . 
  whether we like it or not , someone is going to get the bulk of the operations . 
  that 's just the way things are now . 
   did n't happen . 
  why is it that where some people see doom and gloom others see opportunities ? 
  things will change , business will adapt . 
  remoaners will crawl back under their rocks . 
  truly , politics is a different beast south of the border . 
  for one , apparently you do n't need to actually argue your points . 
  you can just dismiss anything with `` enhanced optimism '' and `` remoaners '' . 
  if only the scots learned how to do that . 
   read the article . 
  brass plate on the door , 100 jobs moving , 2600 staying put . 
  i remember when the `` brass plate '' argument was made for scotland 's companies after independence . 
  let me repeat alistair darlings counter-points : due to different regulatory regimes , it 's perfectly reasonable to expect companies will start moving the bulk of their operations to their main market . 
  it 's also where a majority of their clients are . 
  yup , but the double consonant and the vowel lengths are a pain . 
  * ask someone about a word * * they stare at you blankly * * say it again in a funny voice * `` oh , you mean , * says the word in the exact way i was saying it * ! '', 
  * look of confusion as i try to figure why i 'm doing this to myself *, 
  both your suggestions would make learning the language a lot , lot easier . 
  especially getting rid of `` ly '' , i accept that the inability to properly differentiate vowels being my own problem . 
  have they opened it up to non-german eu nationals yet ? 
  there was talk of it awhile ago , and it would attract a significant amount of people . 
   the eu organization is not set up to affect politicians of nation states in this way it almost is . 
  ask your government on it 's stance on the european public prosecutor 's office , and why it has been blocking it . 
  attempts are being made to start the eppo , which would prosecute fraud in eu funding . 
  spanish and italian governments have actually been very supportive of it . 
  who are blocking it : the netherlands , greece , hungary and poland . 
  okay , i 'll bite . 
  the plugs are the safest you can get , because a houses ' grid is extremely unsafe . 
  so they had to over-design the plugs , to make up for the ring-circuit used . 
  it makes no sense with modern appliances and modern housing builds , which admittedly there are few of . 
  it all saves up on copper in the wiring and appliance flex-cables though , and if that 's your standard for success then win . 
  the transport safe topic is `` underinvestment '' and `` privatization '' . 
  people get really worked up about those two words , and you 're on solid ground . 
  but there 's an entire book i can write on how the real world works regarding that . 
  nimbyism , corruption , a distrust of `` centralization '' , and a lack of frame of reference makes any transport project doomed to failure in the uk . 
  even successes mostly end up as cheap knock-offs of continental counterparts . 
  london is the only place in the uk that can be considered modern as a result . 
  and there are actually people who defend fptp , the failure of the referendum was n't just because people preferred pr . 
  as for the rest , i honestly do n't know where to start . 
  it 's as if there 's two different parliaments . 
  the one in people 's mind and the one in reality , and it can switch a few times during a conversation . 
  you have to understand it 's not `` bragging '' , if that 's the mental image you 're forming , well except when it actually is with added bullshiting to boot , but it usually ends up like a form of `` cherished acceptance '' , like you did with the plugs . 
  there 's a `` mental britain '' in which everything sort of makes sense . 
  and in that space you find another country , a place that did n't go through the middle of the 20th century . 
  that 's the cornerstone of it , not out-of-nowhere bragging , but a permanent set of roze-tinted glasses . 
  title is misleading , read the article . 
  they 're publishing a series of proposals , starting with one for the march summit , and ending before the the december summit .
