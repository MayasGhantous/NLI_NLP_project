the gypsies presented in the documentary i linked to are thieves . 
  they make a substantially amount of money and they continue living in camps without any basic facilities . 
  they do n't have to , but they still do . 
  this was my point . 
  but then why do they continue living like this and they go in italy or spain to `` work '' . 
  they can surely afford to rent an apartment with the amount of money they make `` working '' . 
  so basically when airline companies realised that they can make money by offering gsm services inside the plane , the safety concern related to mobile phones were suddenly gone . 
  the hungarians actually opposed this plan . 
  they would have lost many privileges ( including in transylvania ), 
  it depends how it would been have implemented . 
  it could have been a precursor of the eu . 
  i just want to point out that , before joining the eu , romania was blamed for decades for discriminating the roma population . 
   ineffective i would not call placebo ineffective . 
  russian is not the only minority language . 
  for example , there are also romanian speakers in ukraine . 
  the `` founding '' document of the eu ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schuman_declaration )  world peace can not be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it . 
   europe will not be made all at once , or according to a single plan . 
  it will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity . 
   the pooling of coal and steel production ... will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war , of which they have been the most constant victims . 
  what would you think if switzerland would lose the free access to the eu market ? 
  i do n't think it 's unrelated . 
  it 's part of the bilateral agreements which switzerland decided unilaterally to break . 
   romania has the potential of being one of the richest countries in europe you 're deluding yourself . 
  romania has the potential to maybe become economically close to portugal . 
  they were discussing about gdp , not gdp per capita . 
   do n't ignore the fact that probably over 500 million chinese live better off then all romanians i finding really hard to believe that over 30 % of chinese live better than the average romanian . 
   and some of them get to work by highways , or high-speed trains , which romania has none highway construction seems to be going ok also in romania . 
  100 km/year is a good rate ( at least in my opinion ) . 
  this means that in 10 year romania will have an ok highway infrastructure . 
  10 years is not that much . 
  edit : china is able to build so much infrastructure because they do n't care too much about quality/safety . 
  just google `` highway collapse china '', 
  china is still significant poorer than romania ( even after decades of huge economic grow ) . 
  it 's much easier to have a large ( percent-wise ) economic grow when you start from so low . 
  anyhow , comparing china and romania makes no sense . 
  they are just too different in regards to size , political system , culture . 
  correct !, 
  but then the swiss complain when they can no longer access the common eu market . 
   if my customer wants a victorinox knive , an omega watch or some part for it 's process automation from abb , they will still buy why ? 
  if the new tariffs will increase the price , the customer could choose similar products from other companies . 
  of course they are going to respect it . 
  what else could they do ? 
  invade switzerland ? 
  but : if switzerland has the democratic right to protect its citizens by imposing immigration quotas , the eu has also the right to protect the eu businesses and , maybe , impose some restrictions to swiss imports . 
  it works both ways !, 
  the eu has the duty to protect the interest of eu citizens/companies . 
  on the other hand , the eu central power is losing popularity . 
  a really strong move could make this even worst . 
  let 's see what will happen . 
  there should clearly be a connection between romanian and slavic languages . 
  i mostly blame her . 
  if you invest a large amount of money in a foreign property it 's absolutely essential to know the law and make sure you pay your taxes . 
  < joke  it will continue to be . 
  started school in 87 - i remember playing a `` homemade '' version of belgian monopoly . 
  nobody had the `` original '' game . 
  we just made copies !, 
  meaning we drew our own board and cards ( for both cities and money ) . 
  we also bought hundred of buttons ( until our local store actually ran out ) . 
  as you can imagine it took awhile until everything was done . 
  but it was fun !, 
  - for breakfast usually : `` paine in ou '' ( http://goo.gl/cag5gx ) - sweets : eugenia ( http://www.dobrogeagrup.ro/en/produse.php?cat=21 ) - school uniform : during the communist times : http://goo.gl/cvkorx, 
   as expats tend to leave at the first sign of trouble for somewhere else . 
  when you get 80 % of your last salary for one year without doing too much , many of them choose to stay . 
  you 'll be surprised at the number of so-called expats ( mostly working in banking ) from switzerland who now are unemployed and use the social services . 
  so all the `` immigrants '' who pick fruits because locals do n't want to do it are actually expats ? 
  why ? 
  i do n't think the dutch learned the `` local '' languages when they colonised all these places . 
  how can an immigrant be `` unwanted '' if ( s ) he works legally ? 
  nobody 's forcing the `` destination '' country to accept them and giving them the right to work . 
  what 's the difference between an expat and an immigrant ? 
  serious question : how about the tons of european expats ( especially british ) from dubai ? 
  should they also be coerced to learn arabic ? 
  the historical irony is absolutely delicious . 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:former_dutch_colonies ), 
  americans are in , therefore russians must stay out . 
  case closed !, 
  they stole our mamaliga !, 
  i one of the few romanian who , in principal , agrees with a potential autonomy of the szekely land . 
  i just do n't think this is the right time . 
  the hungarian extreme right is too powerful !, 
  let 's wait 10-20 years until things cool down . 
  he claims that he used only a screwdriver to `` bypass '' the security systems when stealing the paintings . 
  if this is true , there 's definitely something fishy there ... 
  that 's interesting ... for me ( as a complete outside ) seems very strange that tito ( which was ethnically croat ) could have been a fan of greater serbia ideologist . 
  since , due to the free european market , romania is full of german supermarket chains , i 'm sure many of your ceos will disagree . 
  in my opinion what it clearly demonstrates it that romania does not accept that status of a german/france/british colony . 
  which is good !, 
   because canada is a goddamn sovereign nation and can set their immigration policy as they damn well please also romania is a goddamn sovereign nation which has the right to say yes or no to any trade agreement . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  edit : is n't this part of a `` normal '' diplomatic negotiation process ? 
  i mean , saying `` we accept * this * only if you accept * that * '' is the general `` pattern '' under which most such negotiations are work upon . 
  this post needs to be up-voted at least as much as the one which linked to the initial story . 
  relatively speaking , i think also romania did a good job . 
  stray dogs ( mainly ) + wild animals !, 
  my favorite : silva bruna, 
  stay dogs are euthanized in most western countries . 
  only in the us , three millions dogs/cats are killed each year . 
  i do n't see what 's the problem .
