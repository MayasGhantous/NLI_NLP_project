  in all polls , a possible unification with romania is not supported by the majority . 
  < joke  decaf romanians < / joke , 
   irina walker , also known as irina kreuger , is the third daughter michael , the last king of romania . 
  on the list of top 100 british royals , she is 95th in succession to queen elizabeth . 
  king michael is the great-great grandson of queen victoria and third cousins with the queen . 
   michael jackson , ozzy osbourne , metallica , lenny kravitz , whitesnake , iron maiden -- the list of touring rock stars who do n't know the difference between bucharest and budapest seems to grow every year . 
  following a trend started back in 1992 by michael jackson , so many musicians playing romania 's capital have mistaken it for hungary 's and come on stage shouting `` how are you doing , budapest ? '' that locals have moved on from amused indulgence to being seriously pissed off . 
  before the crises the country has 7-8 year of substantial economic grow : https://www.google.ch/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:rom&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=romania%20gdp while clearly there 's much work to be done , there was a huge progress . 
  romanian ? 
  ah . . so you 're gypsy !, 
  is vuk karadzic related with the other well known karadzic ? 
  romanian : vulgar latin with a huge slavic influence and a significant amount of french/italian loanwords . 
  some interesting characteristics : - having suffix articles and declensions creates bizarre looking words like copilului ( = of the child ) - i know a phrase which is pronounced almost the same in portuguese and romanian and has the same meaning : `` cu carne de vaca nu se moare de foame '' - ( one ) can not die of hunger with cow ( beef ) meat - we use the same word for `` sea '' ( like the black sea ) and `` big '' = mare . 
  pointing the true is always relevant !, 
   what do you mean ? 
  are you saying it 's a coincidence the name romanians choose to call their nation is exactly the same as the name of the byzantine empire , from a linguistic perspective , choosing romania as the name of the country was quite obvious . 
  the people were calling themselves `` ruman '' or `` roman '' well before the creation of the state . 
  adding the `` ia '' termination for the name of the country is used in many other cases ( rus ** ia ** , bulgar ** ia ** , grec ** ia ** )  do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in wallachia called themselves that or that people outside the principality itself referred to it as such before the 1800 's ? 
  do n't forget that moldavia and transylvania existed alongside wallachia as well . 
  neac\u0219u 's letter ( from 1521 ) used the name `` romanian land '' ( c\u011bra rum\u016dn\u011bsk\u016d ) for wallachia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac%c8%99u%27s_letter ) . 
  cazania lui varlaam ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cazania_lui_varlaam ) is another document from 17th century which uses the term `` romanian '' to refer to the people living in moldova . 
  other sources ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_romania ) :  other first-hand evidence about the name romanians used to call themselves comes from authors having lived in transylvania and/or romanian principalities : the transylvanian saxon johann lebel confirms in 1542 that common romanians call themselves `` romuini '' , [ 8 ] orichovius ( stanislaw orzechowski ) notes as late as 1554 that `` in their own language , romanians are called romini , after the romans , and walachs in polish , after the italians '' , [ 9 ] anton verancsics writes around 1570 that romanians living in transylvania , moldavia and walachia call themselves romans ( romanians ) [ 10 ] and martinus szent-ivany cites in 1699 romanian expressions : `` sie noi sentem rumeni '' ( modern standard romanian '' \u015ei noi suntem rom\u00e2ni '' ) and `` noi sentem di sange rumena '' ( in modern standard romanian `` noi suntem de s\u00e2nge rom\u00e2n '' ) [ 11 ] the idea that romanians descend from romans is much older than the 19th century national movement ( which clearly overemphasized it ) . 
   it 's interesting how a small number of people just decided that the country should be named romania , and not dacia . 
  well , people where calling themselves romanians ( `` roman '' or `` ruman '' ) long before the creation of the romanian state . 
  choosing romania as the name of the country was quite normal from a linguistic perspective . 
  the `` dacian '' hypothesis is pure nonsense . 
  bad comparison !, 
  i really do n't get why some many people are focus on schengen . 
  it 's really not that important . 
  ok , airport transit would take a little let , by that 's about it . . 
  corruption is not the real reason . 
  read further down the article . 
   interior minister p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen rejected claims that finland 's stance is coloured by the persistent problem of eastern european roma beggars in finnish cities . 
  year right ... of course , it 's not politically correct for them to say that they do n't like the roma . 
  no different than germany/austria banning nazi parties . 
  romanian citizen can freely travel all over europe even now . 
  next year the right to work will be also be granted . 
  it might seem racist , but i really doubt that roma will go anywhere in europe looking for jobs . 
  they only reason there are no ( native ) roma in germany is the nazi regime . 
  maybe it would actually be an historical justice to have germany integrate the roma population . 
  stupidquestionsredux : stop creating new accounts !, 
  we all know it 's you !, 
  since , inside the eu , anybody can travel without restrictions to any other country , dividing the number of residents to the number of arrests ( for a particular nationality ) makes no sense . 
  i really doubt that most roma beggars/scammers are in any way officially registered . 
  http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa.php?ids=53&amp;year=2008 so 6 % of turks would n't like to have muslims as neighbours . 
  since 99 % of turks are muslim this seems highly unlikely ... 
  most of `` romanian '' mafia it 's actually roma . 
  and most romanians see them as a different ethnicity ( for example , they speak a different language ), 
  romanies are around 5 % of the population of romania . 
  all western countries were accusing us that we 're discriminating against them for decades ... 
  on the other hand italians have been a clearly much more `` effective '' exporters of crime world-wide and the general opinion of them is positive . 
  ea este datoare a pl\u0103ti pe preo\u0163ii bisericilor sale '' english : basically states that the `` comunes '' ( cities , villages ) have the duty to take care of the church and to pay the priests, 
  ea este datoare a pl\u0103ti pe preo\u0163ii bisericilor sale '' ( and this is iorga , not wikipedia ) now you could argue that the church gets too much . 
  i totally agree !, 
  the reality is that churches receive money from the state in most european countries . 
  this should be changed . 
  i agree !, 
  but starting with probably the most religious country from eu might to be the best strategy ... 
  i really like the swiss system . 
  you are asked to declare you religion . 
  if your church is officially recognized , the state takes a percent of your income and give it to the church . 
  if you declare yourself an atheist , you do n't pay anything . 
  at that time , there was a `` tradition '' for the rich people to donate land to the church . 
  while i agree with them , i also think the other side has a valid argument : the orthodox church used to be extremely rich until the 19th century . 
  they owned around 20 % of the country 's arable land . 
  a reformer ( cuza ) just confiscated all this land and gave it to peasants . 
  as compensation , the state `` promised '' the church that it would take care of its financial needs . 
  romania transylvania : slow , ( too ) polite , kind of stupid , but also more `` civilized '' bucharest : extremely rude , arrogant moldova : poor , lazy oltenia ( in southern romania ) : speaking alot and at a fast pace , not to be trusted szekely land : they do n't want to speak romanian ; you can not even buy bread without asking in hungarian, 
  the title is absolutely correct !, 
  gypsies will steal no jobs ... that 's actually the very last thing in their mind . 
  the it is doing actually quite well in romania the salaries are really decent . 
  not huge , but decent ( 1500 to 2000 euro/month after tax , for a good c/c + + developer ) . 
  not a problem if you 're orthodox !, 
  actually , i think it 's actually mandatory to be married if you want to be a priest . 
  i do n't know any unmarried priest . . 
  1994 fifa world cup ( usa ) was rather successful . 
  the total travel distances were probably longer . 
  euro also written in cyrillic . 
  nice !, 
  bulgarians must feel special . 
  i would not call ionesco a romanian writer . 
  most of his work was written in french and only translated in romanian . 
  the `` nationality '' of the writer is the language ( s ) he writes in ... 
  let 's not forget about titulescu !, 
  romania 1 . 
  brasov ( maybe also stop at the bran castle on the way ) 2 . 
  peles castle 4 . 
  sighisoara if you 're driving , do n't miss the transfagarasan highway, 
  you 're trolling . . right ? 
  how can you `` force '' others to unify with you if they do n't want ? 
  pig fat . . really !, 
  pig fat !, 
  the main reasons : * most moldavians do n't want !, 
  the russians managed to convinced them that they are different than romanians * many romanians oppose the potential unification because moldavians are significant poorer and also we 're not doing so well ourselves . 
  things might change in the future !, 
  all moldavians are now able to get the romanian citizenship ( even if they do n't live in romania ) . 
  the younger generations are clearly more `` european '' . 
  also , their education system seems to be pro-romanian ( in some ways ) ; they study in school , for example , the romanian history ( not only moldavian ) . 
  there 's a really funny movie about then romanian/moldavian relations : wedding in bessarabia ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741706/ ), 
  was n't ireland in a similar situation maybe 100 years ago ?
