  the only eu country which is using it is bulgaria . 
  they do n't ( yet ) use euro . 
  i wonder why israel does so bad . 
  it goes against many stereotypes related to jews and education . 
  well , stupidquestionsredux was claiming that ethnicity is not relevant ( all that matters is your citizenship ) . 
  it this were the case , the whole concept of minority rights would become irelevant . 
   why does it matter to what ethnic group they belong ? 
  if they 're romanian citizens they 're romanians as far as i 'm concerned so the hungarians living in romania are also just romanians ? 
  so , no need for minority rights , education in hungarian . 
  i always find it funny to hear a british ( or a french , dutch , belgium ) telling other people to go back to their fucking country !, 
  hello ? 
  your whole history it 's about you not going back to your fucking country !, 
  < joke  i 'm actually not that sure !, 
  both hungarians and romas have non-european origins so clearly they have many thinks in common . 
  < / joke  btw : it 's pretty clear for everyone that you 're actually stupidquestionsredux . 
  and let me guess : you 're probably a hungarian from transylvania really pissed that transylvania is no longer part of hungary !, 
  but still ? 
  why romania ? 
  why not sending them to belgium if they keep moving from one place to another ? 
  the roma from the story have nothing to do with romania . 
  they do n't originate from there . 
  the linguistic similarities with roma and romania are just a coincidence . 
  where did you get your number ? 
  3 millions ? 
  that 's ridiculous !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma_minority_of_hungary estimates : 450,000 to 1,000,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma_in_romania estimates : 1.5 million [ percent-wise there are probably more roma in hungary than romania, 
  this is a really `` delicate '' issue for romanians, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_romania  name of romania ( rom\u00e2nia ) comes from the romanian rom\u00e2n , which is a derivative of the latin adjective romanus ( roman ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_romani_people  the demonyms of the romani people , lom and dom share the same etymological origin , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] reflecting sanskrit \u1e0doma `` a man of low caste , living by singing and music no connection !, 
  why to romania ? 
  there 's nothing connecting gypsies to romania ( more than to other countries ), 
  until 2014 , older eu countries can impose restrictions to the right to work of romanians ( and bulgarians ) . 
  not all do ( ireland , sweden and others i think do n't ) . 
  after 2014 the right to work can not be restricted . 
  well , most romanians in spain are not gypsy ( the roma minority makes less than 5 % of the population of romania ) . 
  the `` proper '' romanians do n't look or behave different than the general population so probably this is why they are not so noticeable . 
  schengen has nothing to do with the right the work . 
  for example , romanians and bulgarians already have the right to work in schengen countries like greece , spain , hungary or portugal ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2009/01/four-eu-states-open-doors-to-bulgarian-romanian-workers/63582.aspx ) . 
  joining schengen will not automatically change the status in the other countries . 
  that 's because ukraine in not in the eu . 
  romania , bulgaria are . 
  crossing the schengen border between romania and hungary , for example , it 's similar with passing from uk ( which is not in schengen ) and france . 
  i think people overestimate the importance of being a part of the schengen area . 
  who cares ? 
  you just have to show your id when you cross the border . 
  it usually takes less than 5 minutes . 
  according to wikipedia `` romanians in spain form the largest group of foreigners in the country '' ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_spain ), 
  this is not only a romanian tradition . 
  i discussed about it with a colleague from switzerland and it seems it was also practiced there ( but not anymore ) . 
  anyhow , it 's fun !, 
  no i do n't . 
  forgetting your own language : assimilation . 
  not learning the official language of the country you live in : lack of integration . 
   i do n't think so , more than 1 in 10 romanians is roma , i do n't think that 's the case with muslims in france . 
  higher estimations puts the number close to 10 % ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_france ) . 
  1 in 10 romanians being roma is also a high estimate . 
   well , romanians probably have the largest south asian admixture [ 2 ]  of all people in europe a really simple explanation : they probably also tested some roma . 
  also , other countries with high percent of roma ar missing from you chart ( like hungary , bulgaria ) . 
  actually , romania is the only eastern european/balkan country from the list . 
  for example , the r1a1a haplogroup ( which it is assumed to originate is south asia ) has a high frequency all over eastern europe ( poland , hungary ... ) . 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_r1a_frequency_by_population )  how is that possible ? 
  have n't romanians and romas coexisted for  almost 1000 years ? 
  living close to each other does not mean anything when you have your own language and culture . 
  for example , many hungarian from romania decide to live separately and not to integrate ( especially in szekelyland ) . 
   bullshit roma integration never worked on a large scale . 
  unfortunately , this is the true !, 
  i do n't know to much about this issue so i do n't have a clear opinion . 
  i just wonder what would be the consequences in other eu countries of this potential `` precedent '' . 
  would this be an encouragement to other separatist movements ( e.g. 
  spain ) ? 
  in my option , only radical solutions could succeed if we want to integrate the roma community . 
  i propose a `` carrot and stick '' approach : - affirmative action measurements for all roma who want to go to school or generally join the mainstream - children who are forced or encouraged by their parents to steal or beg should be taken away by the social services and not given back until parents get a job and show serious commitment in joining and contributing to the society, 
   meanwhile , the census showed that the majority of moldovans do not consider themselves romanians the result of 45 years of russian brainwashing . 
  i think this is the first statistic i see where romania looks good !, 
  also , it 's interesting to see that even germany is above the maastricht level !, 
   where else in europe are there living conditions like this ? 
  how about them trying to do something to improve these conditions ? 
  like cleaning their `` apartments '' and hall-ways . 
  you do n't really need money for this !, 
  most of them do n't have ( or want ) jobs so it 's not like they do n't have time . 
  and to answer to your questions : they live in the exactly same conditions when they go to spain/italy to `` work '' ( meaning stealing or begging ) . 
  it 's just their way or life !, 
  it 's easy to judge when your do n't live there . 
  the gypsy culture is not like any other culture you ever met . 
  like it or not , but this is the true . 
  from my own personal experience : when gypsy kids start to take a shit in your elevator you know that something must be done to control the access to the building . 
  and let 's see what the `` western '' countries did . 
  france , for example , deported them asap . 
  this is what i call toleration !, 
  some immigrants bring money . 
  others bring labor . 
  both are needed for the economy . 
  this is just ridiculous !, 
  you go to spain and continue to eat british food ?? 
  it 's like having a ferrari and continuing driving your lada everyday . 
  i think there 's also a selection bias involved . 
  as a romanian , you have to be really damn good to be accepted at a top uk university . 
  this article has no basis in reality . 
  aids is a minor problem in romania compared with other eu countries . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_hiv/aids_adult_prevalence_rate romania 00.10 united states 00.60 spain 00.50 united kingdom 00.60 so you 're actually 5 times more likely to have aids in spain than in romania . 
  his own party forms the government !,
