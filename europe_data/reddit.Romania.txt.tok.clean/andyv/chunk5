  i took this summer a tour in hawaii ( great place ! ) . 
  the guide actually thought that russia is still ruled by a tsar . 
  we visited uss missouri . 
  there was a lady which asked why there are so many signatures on the capitulation document ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surrender_of_japan ) . 
  she was surprised that there were other countries fighting in the ww2 `` helping '' the us . 
  in the same tour i met a really smart kid . 
  he knew `` everything '' about european politics ( he majored in political sciences ) so , it seems that is the us , good education is a `` privilege '' that only people which are interested and afford to pay for it get . 
  an older video about this case : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h63_zwpv3uy yes . 
  it 's wrong . 
  but i sure would n't want to live close to them . 
  `` does this mean we should empty the louvre ? '', 
  yes . 
  it 's stolen goods . 
  otherwise you have no rights to complain about nigerian scammers , for example . 
  they are just doing what you used to do . 
  the problem was that germans saw these minorities as a reason for invading other countries . 
  sometimes , safety and politic stability are more important than human rights . 
  good question !, 
  there 's a huge difference . 
  the old moldava province also contained what is today the republic of moldova . 
  you can not claim that people from rep. of moldova are not `` real '' moldavians . 
  greeks say that fyrom has not historical connection with `` real '' macedonians ( and they have sound arguments to back this up ) . 
  i find it strange that romania and moldavia are so far away . 
  it 's basically almost the same culture . 
  also , usually moldavians are more religious . 
  i just do n't see how they can be less traditional than romanians . 
  it just does n't make any sense . 
  `` there is very little mixing between communities , and these immigrant communities basically maintain their own culture , speaking their own language etc. 
  within these enclaves . '', 
  so , basically they are doing exactly what the british used to do when they went to what is today pakistan , bangladesh . 
  i find the historical irony absolutely delicious . 
  how about colonization ? 
  i do n't remember the french , for example , taking african names . 
  or the british , indian names . 
  so the upper comment is correct . 
  multi-culturalism is not new . 
  and also , before the ww2 many european countries were multi-cultural ( e.g. 
  jewish population , germans in czechslovakia and in romania ... ) . 
  even now , some countries are `` traditionally '' multicultural ( belgium , switzerland , finland , some parts of romania ), 
  great !, 
  you 're right about serbia . 
  do n't go there !, 
  visit bosnia instead . 
  sarajevo is beautiful this time of year . 
  `` 1962 : saudi arabia abolishes slavery 1962 : yemen abolishes slavery 1963 : united arab emirates abolishes slavery 1970 : oman abolishes slavery 1981 : mauritania abolishes slavery '' wow . 
  unbelievable . . 
  so there must be many ex-slaves still alive . 
  this would be an interesting ama, 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  not to defend anyone but the airport infrastructure is not meant to handle so much traffic in such a short amount of time . 
  and it does n't have to , since it 's a one time event . 
  thus , some delays are to be expected . 
  i also think it 's stupid to `` claim '' we 're romans . 
  we 're not . 
  just like french are not gauls , english are not angles and modern greeks are not ancient greeks . 
  different times , completely different cultures . 
  i was just arguing on the historical fact without any `` modern '' nationalistic connotations . 
  i agree , there is a lot of nationalistic bullshit . 
  on the other hand , we have always called ourselves `` rom\u00e2ni '' ( or rum\u00e2ni ) ( and thus , rom\u00e2nia ) . 
  the connection is clear . 
  also , the idea that romanians descended from romans is much older the 19th century nation awakening . 
  for example , `` letopisetul cantacuzinesc '' , a document written by stoica ludescu in the 17th century states ( in actually its first sentence ) that ` romanians `` split '' from romans and migrated north ', 
  well . . 
  compared with a chinese they do . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7756387/uk-child-death-rate-twice-as-high-as-sweden.html while it 's bad , it 's not actually that bad . 
  uk 's rate 0.53 / 100 children . 
  and nobody 's letting children die because they did n't bribe . 
  if you read the article ( and not only the misleading title ) the problem is actually that the hospital is not able to hire doctors . 
  i 'm wondering how did they compute the world average wage . 
  india and china ( countries with huge populations ) have significant bellow that . 
  i agree . 
  schengen is really not that important . 
  the only personal benefit i see is a faster transit time in airports , since usually schenen and non-schengen flights use different terminals . 
  i 'm just wondering what do you think will be the main negative consequences of romania and bulgaria joining the schengen agreement . 
  any romanian or bulgarian who wants to go in the west can do it now without any restriction . 
  you just have to show your id card at the border with hungary . 
  it takes couple of second . 
  schengen has absolutely nothing to do with the right to work or settle . 
  i really do n't get your point . 
  you could also then say then that if the americans from the `` story '' wanted to speak in english in france it 's their personal free choice . 
  so then why judging them ? 
  the questions is if being a jerk with a tourist because ( s ) he tries to speak with you in english is nice/desirable ( or is something that you will do ) . 
  that 's point of the discussion . 
  should every country `` require '' that their tourists try to speak their official language ? 
  is this really feasible ? 
  like it or not , english is `` de facto '' international language . 
  all posts in / r/europe are in english even if german is spoken more is europe as first language . 
  well , for centuries , globalization ( in its early form of colonialism ) benefited exclusivity the european nations so , of course , it was acceptable . 
  the new forms of globalization ( immigration , outsourcing , ... ) start also to benefit the former victims and some negative consequences are felt in the west and thus , they are no longer considered right and normal . 
  yes ... because we all know that when the french went to other countries ( in africa , middle east ) they respected the local way of life , learned the local language and did everything humanely possible to integrate into the local culture . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bojan_aleksandrovi%c4%87 this is the priest who complained about the church issue . 
  articles in serbian newspapers about this problem : http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/sloboda_izbora_ili_nametanja_volje.55.html?news_id=235009 http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.290.html:311180-spor-zbog-zvonare-rpc ( i do n't speak serbian . 
  i 've just googled his name and use google translate to try to understand the content of these articles ), 
  well ... 
  the situation was resolved by now ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=79054 ) i think , on one hand , there is ( or was ) a real problem related to the vlach minority . 
  couple of years ago , some serb church official even consider destroying the only romanian church from the region . 
  on the other hand , i think the `` last '' minute approach also had the point of `` showing the muscles '' . 
  basically the dutch did the same in regards to schengen agreement . 
  there were some technical details which we had to fulfill in order to be accepted . 
  even after they were all fulfilled , netherlands decided to still veto the acceptance to schengen .
