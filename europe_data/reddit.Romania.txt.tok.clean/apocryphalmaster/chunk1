sort of like the - berg 's and - stein 's in german ? 
  '' a se c\u0103ca '' in romanian - that 's the infinitive we have '' c\u0103care '' ( \u0103 is a schwa ) too but that 's like another kind of infinitive used to make nouns . 
  so it means `` shitting '' as a noun . 
  `` defecation '' is a better translation . 
  well the farming equipment used to be black sorry, 
  oh no he did n't !, 
  i just remembered ... in romania [ some people add cherry sauce to dishes . 
  ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=sos+de+visine&amp;newwindow=1&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=798&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmi6fkizargxgivy7yuch3sfayh# ) like mashed potatoes with pork steak or chicken breast ( judging by the google search suggestions ) .

  romania greattst countrey, 
  do n't forget about curses involving ancestors . 
  `` futu-\u021bi mor\u021bii m\u0103-tii '' which means `` i fuck your mother 's dead '' . 
  there are curses involving god ( s ) or even christ ( s ) ( `` dumnezeii '' , `` hristo\u0219ii '' instead of `` mor\u021bii '' ) , as well as `` neamul '' ( `` neamul m\u0103-tii '' would mean your mother 's folk , people ) . 
  also `` g\u00e2tul m\u0103-tii '' which would mean `` your mother 's throat '' or `` pizda m\u0103-tii '' which slavs will understand instinctively - these can come after `` futu-\u021bi '' ( `` fuck '' ) or `` du-te \u00een '' ( `` go into '' ), 
  whoa . 
  `` maic\u0103-ta '' means your mum in romanian too . 
  usually shortened to `` m\u0103-ta '', 
  also [ charlottenburg ] ( https://vimeo.com/97110147 ) . 
  it gets mentioned here a lot . 
  and the other etymology is from slavic `` da '' which means `` yes '' . 
  also interesting is that `` sic '' actually turned into '' \u0219i '' , the word for `` and '' , not `` yes '' .

  that 's actually not as bad as i expected .

  no one 's suggesting a space colony :(, 
  thanks . 
  * romanian * english * ( very poor ) french i 'd actually like to learn italian . 
  korean looks nice too , but i 'm afraid it 'll take too long . 
  where will it go when it gets removed ? 
  the lyrics as we understand them in romanian must sound really odd to the portuguese , but they 're so easy to do since the two languages have almost the same set of sounds . 
   `` german merchants '', 
  that 's the problem with today 's approach to maintaining a state of equal opportunity . 
  ** gender quotas are forced discrimination . 
  nice name, 
   no zombie worshiping cult existed there . 
  you know , i 'm not even religious or anything , but i 'm very tempted to throw your argument out the window when i hear phrases like that . 
  stuff like `` magic sky fairy '' , `` sky daddy '' , `` zombie jew '' etc. 
  well yeah , but afaik royal succession does n't take gay kings into account . 
  so that would be a bit of a mess . 
  unless of course we define bear kings and twink kings, 
   the rumour goes that it 's because he 's gay . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was because he had a relationship ( child ? ), 
  with a romanian commoner woman . 
  do n't know , they might think too many subscribers lead to worse content . 
  it 's in their sidebar , the last red paragraph . 
  do n't link to that sub please well you 're free to do it but you might get banned from it . 
  agree , the water in most places looks/feels like some unholy lettuce broth . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ into ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ found ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ worm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ foreskin . 
  all those - porn subreddit names seem so childish to me . 
  i ca n't really take them seriously . 
  a question i 've had for a long time : does anyone keep pigs ? 
  i mean for me it 's kind of weird to imagine the early days of islam , i suppose once a village converted from another religion they let all their pigs go ? 
  is a completely muslim country supposed to have no domestic pigs ? 
  i suppose it 's analogous to * du-te-n pizd\u0103 *, 
   but because we use closed vowels oh , so i suppose that would be an explanation why it 's easier for romanians to understand italian than the other way around . 
  also why romanian sounds so similar to portuguese sometimes . 
  romanian also has a definite article at the end of words . 
  might be from a substrate . 
  also our word for * table * is * masa * too ( * mas\u0103 * indefinite , * masa * definite ) . 
  i actually like most of the chocolate/sweets in lidl . 
  except for that chocolate spread , it 's like concrete . 
  that 's a really unbelievably bad article coming from wikipedia . 
  the fact that it seriously quotes a horror show ( trying to pass itself off as a documentary ) , and ... half of it reads like an entry on an rpg class i mean look at this  user with this ability either is or can transform into a strix, 
   there is not a single neighbour they have good realtions with well they have n't screwed up their relations with the black sea yet, 
  is n't it a pun based on communists calling their regime the [ `` golden age '' ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/epoca_de_aur_%28rom%c3%a2nia%29 ) ? 
  well why would n't it be ? 
  google does n't hand-pick the images to fit any agenda afaik . 
  the ads could be like sheets with holes in them and the side facing the windows could be black . 
  a lot less noticeable . 
  i 've seen it done on tram windows . 
  well 1 euro ~ 4.5 lei cheapest shot i ever drank was 2 lei , tuica ( but that 's homemade and of course it 's going to be cheaper ) i think i once found one for 3 lei , it was some shitty vodka . 
   a few special characters that we do n't really use i would n't say we do n't , it 's just that a lot of romanians on the internet use english a lot and do n't bother to switch back to the romanian keyboard . 
  i have lots of friends on fb that actually switch to the romanian keyboard to be clearer ( for example * \u021b\u00e2\u021b\u0103 * means * tit * but * tata * means * dad * ) or make puns work . 
  and on websites/printed paper i usually assume a lack of professionalism when i see missing diacritics . 
  tbh if we were to ditch the old characters i think we should find equivalent constructions ( like ts and sh ) instead of just removing the commas/whatever they have . 
   i do n't have to pretend that i 'm clever and edgy because you are , or because you do n't feel compelled to ? 
  whoa, 
   agoraphobics are legit just admit you 're one , nothing wrong with it . 
  do n't try to rationalize it and shit on everyone else in the process . 
  people party , always have . 
   this miniature shellshock ( keep the counter going up ) will nicely bring down to earth , on their feet , some zombie-like degenerates , hit in the face with reality when life ai n't anymore about being cool or about extravaganza or vanity or what car you have or what social backround you 're in not sure if life was ever about that .
