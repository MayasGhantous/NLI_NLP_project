i have been to saunas ( at the gym that i have been ) . 
  i think i went to dry and also to `` humid '' saunas ( if there really is this kind of classification ) . 
  they were hot as hell itself . 
  some were single sex , some were mixed . 
  never nude , always with towel/garment . 
  i really enjoy saunas , i find them very relaxing but i ca n't imagine someone going to one during summer ... 
  du\u0219man ? 
  my parents had only 1 child ( me ) . 
  i want 2 maximum . 
  well , there are a few of people who regret comunism and our great comunist leader ceau\u0219escu ... 
  japanese in highschool . 
  it 's not common at all in romania ... i just had `` the luck '' of a crazy principal that kinda ' `` forced us '' to study it . 
  did you meet/train alongside some romanian military forces ? 
  how did you perceive them ? 
  how are they seen by other military forces ? 
  i have considered/am considering moving to another country but not because of financial strain , but because i would like to benefit from better services . 
  anyway , i know some ppl who emigrated to earn more money . 
  they usually do this because a shit job in a more wealthy country is better payed than a shit job in romania and they have no intention on living abroad not even in decent conditions ( they plan in returning ) . 
  foreign cars ( non-eu ) are pretty popular . 
  alot of hyundais , toyotas can be found on our streets . 
  when i was young : half life . 
  now : dota 2 . 
  yes, 
  yes, 
  they will pour concrete in it , everyone knows that !, 
  corruption and poverty . 
  in romania they are popular but not so cheap . 
  ofc . 
  i think there must be a eu directive that imposes the states to implement this into their national law ( or a regulation that is national law ) . 
  because : * ( our character ) we had too many internal feuds and lacked cohesion as well as decent leadership . 
  * ( geography ) most of the time we had a bigger and stronger state/empire with whom we shared a border . 
  it was in their best interest ( and easy ) to cripple us/take our resources ( romans , ottomans , russians ) . 
  this has happened for hundreds of years . 
  well ... one of our former presidents had a funny [ accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0s0hswpiwk ) . 
  * brown bears * boars * wolves ( althogh i did n't hear about any victims , i know that they exist and that they sometimes attack ) * vipers * we also have some species of deer but i do n't think it attacks humans * i did n't include the usual ( ticks , mosquitos , bees , etc. ), 
  or our bisons / `` zimbru '' ( because we just started repopulating the forests with it ), 
  or we should look at some lesser houses . 
  oh yeah , right . 
  now it does n't seem so strange . 
  til that vlad supposedly impaled a donkey ??!, 
   home distilling equipment :o not even [ for beer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homebrewing ) ??? 
  so you guys prefer the term `` chips '' or what ? 
  yeah , giving the right to vote to women in 1991 . 
  i 'm not saying that your direct democracy does n't work or that i do n't envy you for it , i 'm just saying it has it 's flaws and you should keep an open mind . 
   but you ca n't beat the price/performance ratio hm , do n't be so sure, 
  hello my gypsy friend , i love your city , budapest !,

   andre rie til he is dutch, 
  barefoot during summer , we wear socks during winter . 
  it depends what you wan na see/do . 
  europe is pretty diverse . 
  for instance if you want to travel to the seaside it 's probably not the best period . 
  nope . 
  bucharest-ilfov county ... we are definitely the arogant assholes of the country . 
  in europe , i would say france is the smugest country . 
  why learn a useless language ? 
  just like renting ? 
  it 's fine by me . 
  prague, 
  is polish hard for you ? 
  if you 're suffocating at 27 , what will you do saturday ? 
  nope . 
  we are by far shaorma/kebab and italian cuisine lovers . 
  although i know and went to indian restaurants they are not popular at all . 
  no public role . 
  let 's burn it to the ground and start over . 
  usually our pms are not funny , but tragic . 
  but there are some comicalish moments : sorry i ca n't find an english version , only a [ romanian one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kitg3kz5m9s ) . 
  our pm at that time , [ adrian nastase ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adrian_n%c4%83stase ) , was story-telling in our parliament about a time when someone had asked him to come ( at his chicken farm ) to count his chickens . 
  he had answered this request by saying that he had better come and count his eggs ( reference to testicles ) . 
  some yes , but many refuse to integrate despite the states efforts . 
  as a general rule , i 'd say they 're more unintegrated than intengrated . 
  not popular in romania, 
  from my travels i guess the most beautiful is [ danube delta ] ( https://www.shutterstock.com/search/danube+delta ) . 
  the views are very rich and diverse . 
  also some mountains like [ retezat ] ( http://www.evadeazacunoi.ro/thumb.php?src=http://www.evadeazacunoi.ro/images/evenimente/410/e806c119ecf756a4677d4f60e60c0ab7.jpg&amp;tip_resize=scale&amp;h=480&amp;w=640&amp;zc=1&amp;q=100 ) . 
  * edited some links *, 
  yes , they certainly have chances . 
  russia is a very rich country you know ... they have a lot of resources . 
  if romania was allowed in 2007 ( god knows why ) , i guess also russia can . 
  * finishing law school ( we call them `` faculties of law '' ) . 
  here the time varies . 
  if you go to a good one , a respectable one ( usually these are the oublic ones ) , you will learn 4 years . 
  you can also find some private faculties with 3 years of study . 
  no master ( llm ) is required . 
  * once you get the diploma you must undergo a examination organised by the bar . 
  * if you pass this you must find a lawyer ( that has 6 years of practice and a good reputation ) who will hire you . 
  * while you work for him , you will also have to attend mandatory courses organised by the bar and that should prepare you for the final exam . 
  * after about 2 years of work and courses you will undergo the final exam . 
  if you pass , you are a lawyer ( the term we use is `` avocat '' ) . 
  * ** as a summary you need 6 years of study and work **, 
  they are very uncommon , although i see their purpose with making a ton of french fries ( #drooling ) . 
  i am am attracted to asians ( japanese , korean , chinese ) and natural gingers . 
  i do n't know why , maybe because they are something rare in romania . 
  the movies are huge with a great fan-base . 
  the comics , not so much ... barely visible . 
  i want a mutually beneficial agreement . 
  i want , if possible , both parties to win . 
  if that is not possible , than i want the eu to loose less .
