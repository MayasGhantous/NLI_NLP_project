  it was really really huge . 
  everyone wanted to collect all the little images of cars that came with every gum . 
  even today there are still [ collectors ] ( https://guminserts.wordpress.com/ ) . 
  * edited tried to fix a link *, 
  in romania 99.99 % of the people i know , including me , say `` cehia '' . 
  so it 's `` czechia '' !, 
  yes, 
  umbre, 
  wow !, 
  ca n't you sue them or something for that ? 
  it 's true . 
  but not only the companies are to blame , also the regional branches / supermarkets and the governments ( the lack of legiferation ) . 
  but you ca n't really appreciate the book if you do n't read it in romanian . 
  `` vaslui '' is our texas .

  i am not ... #facepalm, 
  you can say anything with `` pula '' ( cock ) . 
  `` sugi pula '' ( suck a dick ) probably is one of the most common ones and can be used as friendlyish banther . 
  `` pizda matii '' ( your mother 's vagina ) and `` mortii matii '' ( your mother death ! ), 
  are also very common but usually more offensive and rarely used amongst friends . 
  * lawyer * usually yes * 5 years, 
  dota 2 : russians are toxic and they tend only to speak russian ( does n't matter if you tell them that you dont know the language ) . 
  there are also exceptions , when a russian can make incredible plays . 
  romanians are almost like the russians , if they find other romanians , you can be sure alot of swearing and flamming will occur . 
  of course there are exceptions . 
  usually the most friendly team8s are the sweeds , norwegians , fins . 
  of course there are exceptions ... 
  my grandma used to tell me about hiding from the russian army because they used to rape young women from fer village . 
  she also spoke of their thefts . 
  do n't get me wrong , also the germans took your stuff ( horses , chickens , etc. ), 
  but they gave something in return , although it was small and very underpriced ... they at least had the decency of not taking stuff for free . 
  that 's all the stories i heard . 
  my curently favourite beer is weihenstephaner tap 5 ( if i find it in a bar , i order it ) . 
  i do n't think we have any blogs . 
  but recently our ~ ~ retarded ~ ~ mayor said she wants to organize a contest with the best balcony in bucharest and give an award to the most beautiful one . 
  a romanian contemporary artist mocks this contest on facebook where he made quite the collection of albums of ugly balconies . 
  [ first album ] ( https://www.facebook.com/perjovschi/media_set?set=a.10155450625326789.1073742217.583411788&amp;type=3 ), 
  in romania you can find 2l bottles of beer in most stores . 
  it does n't taste that good , but it 's cheap beer !, 
  romania for example, 
  if you had decent weather i would have considered you my heaven, 
  yeah . 
  they 're usually long , boring and they often are about comunism . 
  in the last years we actually did films about something else ... aaaa and we make fun that in all the romanian movies someone must eat a ciorba ( soup ) . 
  al also pronounce this way , although i know the proper way is `` mim '' ... 
  you forgot about cozonac . 
  tarom is a decent national airline.their routes in romania have a good price/quality ratio . 
  it sometimes can be cheaper than other means of transport . 
  now they have another romanian competitor called `` blue air '' which is cheaper . 
  unfortunately tarom it 's owned and ran by the state , so it 's not doing so well financially ( yeah , probably the corruption is the reason ) . 
  i was 100 % sure you 're talking about dota  ) #feelsbadman, 
  in comunism i could n't say anything about how bad the country was governed . 
  now i can say anything about how bad the country is being governed . 
  huge improvement !, 
  i personally enjoy it , but many many people hate the [ tripe soup ] ( http://www.themidlandhostel.com/the-famous-romanian-tripe-soup-recipe-in-english/ ) or `` ciorba de burta '' ( stomach soup ) as we call it . 
  the thing is that sometimes it smells a bit weird and the pieces or cow stomach are very gummy . 
  also when it 's cold , the soup it has the consistency of gelatine , so yeah , there 's also that . 
  but the taste of a hot tripe soup , rich with vinegar , cream and parsley is totaly worth it !, 
  same in romania . 
  we call them `` lap\u021bi '' ( also related to milk ) . 
  but we use them not only in soup , i 've also seen them fried and eaten . 
  in what country do they eat them ? 
  i usually travel somewhere near ( bucharest ) . 
  often i go cycling with my friends , hiking , or bbqing ( ofc during these activities i also drink ) . 
  i did n't even reach the `` have to move '' point , and i still consider new zealand . 
  it 's hard very hard to be a romanian football fan because we suck at this sport . 
  our national team is like `` sucide squad '' , the best of the worst . 
  if they pass more than 3 times correctly , it 's a record , and they 're national heroes . 
  she did n't slapped/punched him ... so i guess it tourned out quite nice !, 
  99.99 % a little bird or birdie to be precise ( pasarica ) . 
  but the 0.01 % get sometimes creative calling it `` marten '' ( jder ) , squirrel ( veverita ) , etc. 
  i shot once at a shooting range . 
  i enjoyed it , i would shoot again , but still wo n't try to get a gun/licence . 
  what country ? 
  the netherlands ? 
  the curent retirement age is 65 for men and 63 for women, 
  i for one agree with the dutch on this one and i think more coutries should show theirs support . 
  campaigning dictatorship across europe should be banned . 
  i 'm starting to get that also from dota 2, 
  maybe it 's everyone else 's level of french that 's the problem , 
  hey , at least you guys make decent hiking gear , and great value for money !, 
  `` bataia de la ruginoasa '' ( the ruginoasa beating ) . 
  so there 's this romanian tradition , ( only in ruginoasa , thank god ) where ppl dress up and hit each other with long bats made of wood every new years eve . 
  of course , in the recent years the police did n't let them `` have fun '' , but still ... . it 's barbaric for 20th century . 
  yeah . 
  many ppl want us and moldova to become a single state . 
  we have a ngo that promotes that ( `` basarabia e romania '' / `` basarabia is romania '' ) . 
  although there are many manifestations regarding this , most of the folks understand that it 's a political decision and that it 's very hard to find a consensus . 
  moldova joining eu would be considered a de facto unification , and a good compromise . 
  then again , i 've also heard lots of guys that do n't want us to fusion with moldova because they say we are poor enough as we are , and we do n't need to get any poorer . 
  good quality but extremely expensive . 
  so i guess it 's not that good for the average joe . 
  [ tartaria tablets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c4%83rt%c4%83ria_tablets ) i 've heard it 's the oldest form of writing in the world ... but then again , the info was from the internet , so i doubt it . 
  we also have alot of dacian gold like these [ bracelets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacian_bracelets ) . 
  i know about them because of a huge scandal a few years ago because someone tried to smuggle them . 
  maybe there are more , but i 'm not a big fan of archaeology . 
  [ palatul parlamentului ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament ), 
  well charles visits romania every year or something like that ( he bought estates here or something like that ) . 
  i like the fact that he promotes romania from time to time . 
  other than that , i dont really have an opinion .
