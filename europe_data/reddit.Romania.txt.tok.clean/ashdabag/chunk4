  i think the most common opinion in my country is ` pro choice ` , but i 'm not sure because we are also a higly orthodox country ... anyway abortion is legal here . 
  about 500 lei ~ 100 euros . 
  but usually i have around 100 lei ~ 20 euros for common expenses , and the rest are on my card . 
  customer care, 
  i honestly heard that the french have this problem ... but idk if it 's true or not, 
  very !, 
  they all do politics . 
  i do n't like romanian movies , and i do n't understand all the awards they receive . 
  killing politicians  ) . 
  joke aside , we have too harsh penalties for drugs . 
  for instance in romania you could legaly end up serving a 2 years sentece in prison for marijuana ( posesion , not trafficking ) . 
  nope . 
  it 's called inheritance reserve , and it 's not only aplied to kids . 
  i do n't think that there are `` no visit '' countries in europe , just countries that i for one i 'm less inclined to visit . 
  not popular at all . 
  i know only 1 person irl that also uses it :'( . 
  same with twitter . 
  also `` gopo '' - cannes award winner, 
  it 's getting better though, 
  i do n't know what to say about the powers but i think captain romania would be a complex character . 
  you could n't tell if he 's one of the heroes or a villain  ) just like story with captain america when he fights for hydra , 
  * slobozia - cumland * pestera muierii - the women 's cave, 
  i personaly hate most of romanian movies because of the long stare scenes . 
  [ filantropica ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314067/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) or [ the rest is silence ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0839967/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) or [ closer to the moon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017486/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2 ) are not your typical romanian movie and i like them . 
   we ca n't really blame the ussr for it . 
  yeah communism just fell from the sky in our country . 
  i 'm sure ussr had nothing to do with it ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) * edited spelling *, 
  hey , cheer up !, 
  at least you do n't have the [ biggest hideous communist building ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament ) * edited spelling *, 
  all the governments of romania were very corrupt [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microsoft_licensing_corruption_scandal ) . 
  last year we had [ this tragic event ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colectiv_nightclub_fire ) and we protested like there was no tomorrow until the government fell and was replaced with one with no politicians , but with one formed of [ technocrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technocracy ) . 
  [ this government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciolo%c8%99_cabinet ) has had it 's retards , but no serious scandal so far , and even when a scandal arouse the minister was thrown quickly out of the cabinet . 
  my personal and subjective opinion is that is the best government from 1989 . anyway we have parlamentary elections this late fall , and we expect corrupt retards to come back because of the polls . 
  * edited a link *, 
  they will still vote from the grave just like in teleorman  ), 
  i also think of them , and i 'll also add that shit oprea to the list , but we are not a majority unfortunately :( ... 
  those guys were great but in my opinion the greatest romanian hero was [ ic bratianu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_i._c._br%c4%83tianu ), 
  also [ tzara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tristan_tzara ) . 
  and you did n't stole anything , the retard communists `` forced '' them leave ... anyway i guess it 's a good thing they found a new home in france because they started to write in an international language so their ideeas got to be known to the world . 
  italy, 
  you are wrong because he is hated alright , but not by the majority . 
  all the vicious and corrupt people , all the communists and the elder love him . 
  especially in teleorman , where even the dead love him when it 's election time . 
  i did n't know gabor is a name in hungarian . 
  in romanian `` gabor '' is a slang word for `` cop '' , 
  what ???? 
  i agree with you , as in i also hate not beeing able to communicate with locals , and i am in favour of an intra-european language . 
  i think it would be very usefull if by some magic people would start learning esperanto !, 
  but i do n't think it will be that easy to convince regular folks to give up their language ( alphabet in some cases ) ... language is a big part of one 's nation tradition , heritage ... i do n't think so many people will be open-minded/practical . 
  i once communicated with a bulgarian receptionist and only he was fluent in italian ( the only language he knew besides bulgarian ) . 
  i did n't understand much , but we got along in an acceptable manner . 
  italian seemed rather easy . 
  i also know many people that claim they learned spanish for soap operas ( even my grandma says that she can understand what the actors are saying but she ca n't reproduce ) . 
  so , to conclude , i guess for a romanian is easy to learn italian/spanish , but to actually understand sentences , and not just words from wich you make connections , i do n't think it 's possible . 
  i do n't know about portuguese though , sry . 
  probably a scam . 
  best you do n't answer . 
  not a huge separatist movement and they ask for it since forever and they want to put bombs ? 
  also look at the diplomatic fiasco with the [ us ambasador-szekely flag ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/us-ambassador-romania-photographed-szeklerland-flag/ ) . 
  also check this [ recent documentary ] ( http://www.riseproject.ro/documentar-autonomie-si-petarde/ ) ( it 's in romanian ), 
  i 've seen only one market , in romania , bucharest , every christmas . 
  and i hated it every year . 
  so i do n't recomend it . 
  but then again , maybe i 'm a grinch . 
  i 've heard good rumours about the one in vienna though . 
  we 're eating popcorn while watching the war against corruption . 
  there is a huge separatist movement . 
  there is a hungarian minority in transilvania that wants authonomy/to join hungary . 
  some are extremists ... in 2015 they were planning to [ detonate some explosives on romania 's national day ] ( http://www.balkaneu.com/bomb-attack-hungarian-extremists-foiled-romanias-national-day/ ) , but fortunately they were arrested . 
  i do n't think they can succed of joining hungary because the hungarian minority is quite small ( around 6-8 % ) , and because of the fact that the region where they represent a majority is right in the center of the country , so geography is not on their side ... but who knows ? 
  not at all !, 
  i did n't though so much but if i had to move it would probably be somewhere with warm weather and little rain . 
  i think spain or italy qualify , 
  i know only one person that listens to country . 
  to my knowledge this musical genre is not popular at all in romania . 
  * edited some misspell *, 
  this has happened also in romania almost 6 years ago for approximately the same price . 
  ohh and it turned out to be a copy . 
  and that was the price just for the logo , you do n't wan na know how much it 's launch cost , or the entire branding that was made . 
  [ umbre ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4269716/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wi6-nz9pk ) . 
  it 's produced by hbo so i guess you can find it with subs ... 
  there are far too many !!!, 
  i think a good exemple is [ elena basescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elena_b%c4%83sescu ) * edited grammar *, 
  a shoulder massage is fine and it 's common among friends/relatives, 
  i do n't do it , but from what i heard it 's safe . 
  also many ppl in my country give money to the driver , although it 's a small amout , or anyway smaller than a private/public transporter ... it 's more of a gesture thing ... 
  both, 
  rich and expensive with high taxes , full of civilized alcoholics , with a dreamlike educational system and social system as a whole . 
  aaaaa and the state interferes too much into the private life of a family . 
  conscripting is only voluntary . 
  most ppl do n't care about the army . 
  usually we make fun of our military spending because we buy second hand equipment or something old that no1 else buys . 
  is there an alternative service that can make you eligible for not going ? 
  in romania we learn only the parts relevent to our area . 
  for instance we do n't almost anything about rome , ottoman empire , russia . . but then again my last history lesson in highschool was about 10 years ago ... maybe something ( hopefully ) changed in the meantime . 
  drink tuica , enjoy sarmale with polenta , 
  i just wan na say that i do n't think pepper spray would have helped because you were in a place `` indoors '' and it 's not a good idea to use it in places like that . 
  zaganu is new and not made by big corporation . 
  also sikaru . 
  these 2 you may find in bars .
