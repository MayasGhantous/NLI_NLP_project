fuck all in our neck of the woods , as expected . 
  i believe the firefighting aircraft belong to the hellenic air force , so i 'm not sure that would 've helped much , at least as far as those are concerned ( and they are a valuable asset when fighting fires ) . 
  the military is more than just tanks ... 
  reddit parliament for greece !, 
  good morning to you too , sir !, 
  [ this shit again ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/l0mk7qz13bu?t=1m5s ), 
  thank fuck for that guy and others like him in several other close calls . 
  in late 1983 , as able archer was nearing the end , [ they were literally waiting ] ( https://youtu.be/7ciy5r-tlie?t=1h5m52s ) for an imminent nato first strike . 
   wars have been started for much less , see ukraine . 
  what nonsense !, 
  the guy 's either right or wrong ; makes sense or not . 
  who cares if he 's european or not ? 
  first time you see the albanian flag ? 
  [ joke ? 
  where ?!, 
   fuck victims ' families yeah , you seem like a nice dude ... 
  it 's the glorious [ snake island ] ( http://bit.ly/1do5yi6 ) !, 
  ehm ... does a shitty little [ island ] ( http://www.atlas-geografic.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/insula-31.jpg ) somewhere in the black sea , that us and ukraine have a boner for , count ? 
  guys , seems like coding is n't an option ...  consider that that i ca n't afford long pc sessions , read books for too long or in general stress my eyes for more than 15 minutes ( this and the prevoius posts are wirtten using a vocal recorder ) . 
  yes , this !, 
  if you can make it work with your handicap ( it 's not clear if you 're blind or have other , less severe issues ) and if it 's something that interests you or might at least grow on you , otherwise it 's obviously not worth it if you 'll feel like shit doing it . 
  try it for a while , while you 're studying for your degree and maybe you get hooked , maybe not . 
  nowadays the barrier for entry is extremely low and you can get started for free or very little money . 
  check out the following : [ ** treehouse ** ] ( https://teamtreehouse.com ) ( $ 25/month with a free 14-day triall ) [ ** codecademy ** ] ( http://www.codecademy.com ) ( free ) ** khan academy ** ( free ) : [ computer programming ] ( https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming ) | [ computer science ] ( https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science ) | [ hour of code ] ( https://www.khanacademy.org/hourofcode ) that 's just the very tip of the iceberg , but enough to get your feet wet so that you can at least decide if it 's something you want to delve into deeper , at which point you 'd have to start dedicating some serious time . 
  at the very least it 's worth ruling it out as a career . 
  as for your existential angst , i sympathize , but it 's also easy to get carried away and blow things out of proportion . 
  the reverse is also true , that 's why people are irrationally exuberant when times are good and irrationally gloomy when they 're bad ( my impulses are no different ) . 
  you 're a bit younger than me , but perhaps you can think of past situations when you worried a lot about something that never happened or that turned out better than you expected ( even if in the end it was bad ) . 
  we tend to latch on to gloomy expectations that materialized , but forget the tons that never did . 
  then again , i know uncertainty can screw with your mind a lot in the meantime . 
  my parents divorced 14 years ago ... can get really shitty , but it does get better , at least for you . 
  ** later edit **  consider that that i ca n't afford long pc sessions , read books for too long or in general stress my eyes for more than 15 minutes ( this and the prevoius posts are wirtten using a vocal recorder ) . 
  myeah , sorry to hear that . 
  so development is n't even an option . 
  it 's all fun and games until you get stoned because your pinky was showing . 
  is just sharia !, 
  why you heff to be mad ? 
  comrade op over there is concerned your people - as represented by the british reporter - have a beef with our glorious romanian beef due to two captioned images taken from a benign 10-second segment from a video about a greek meat market . 
  we expect your delegation to submit a formal explanation together with proposed reparations at the eu summit this sunday . 
   mike webster , a 38-year-old occupational therapist from gainesville , florida , was gored as ** he ran with the bulls in pamplona for the 38th time in 11 years . 
  **  san fermin 's media office said he was gored in the armpit , and webster told the associated press from his hospital bed that ** he has n't decided whether he 'll run again because he first needs to discuss the issue with his wife . 
  ** wow , whatever gores your goat , man . 
  maybe take up another hobby though ... 
  always with the `` big money '' , `` the elites '' and other such narratives meant to conjure up hostility . 
  what about all citizens who do n't want to go back to that ? 
  are we all `` big money '' ? 
  since you 're talking about winding back the clock all the way to eec days , it 's not federalists that disagree , but also - i suspect - a lot of people who simply do n't want regression , regardless of which way they see ** forward ** . 
   go to london ,9 million population , good luck finding a working muslim . 
  no working muslims in london . 
  you heard it here first , lads !, 
  that 's happening anyway . 
  there 's always some argument involving the need to protect children one way or another . 
  fortunately , it 's fake . 
  the typography , should clue you in . 
  this photoshop job was the result of some major butthurt going on on various ultra-orthodox , homophobic blogs a few years ago as a result of the actual campaign . 
  te actual ads ** [ look like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gnykbeb.jpg ) ** and read ** `` sexual orientation is not a choice , is not a disease '' ** . 
  i do remember some of the ads being vandalized back then though ... ** edit : ** ah , op , i see you knew all too well how those 2011 banners looked like , yet you decided to pass this faked one as legit . 
  you even [ admitted to calling the city hall ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/3c34sh/sa_fim_realisti_va_fi_nevoie_de_cel_putin_50100/csrtf2m ) to complain about the `` homosexual propaganda '' banners . 
   canicule is not an english term , but the english language lacks of an appropriate term . 
  i believe `` canicule '' or `` canicular days '' are perfectly acceptable , but if that 's not enough , you can use [ `` dog days '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dog_days ) . 
  maybe * teh crazy * spreads via airborne transmission ... 
  yes , a lot of romanians are afraid of draughts , ac etc. 
  drives me nuts , especially in the summer . 
  also on that page ... `` no , the eu does not give you hay fever '' lol !,

  isis vs swiss guard . 
  fight !, 
  humongous dick !, 
  ha , glad to see this here !, 
  i do n't know how he gets those close shots , but they 're awesome . 
  been following him for about a year now ... big fan of snok . 
  damn commie !, 
  rewatch the part starting at [ 15:08 ] ( https://youtu.be/2zssifn2mso?t=15m8s ) . 
  at that point , simon 's in the soldier 's hometown of ** ulan-ude ** ( siberia ) and says the guy just posted a picture taken at that temple , hence his conclusion that he 's probably around , so he goes looking for him . 
  he even states that ulan-ude is `` almost 4,000 miles east '' from the conflict zone . 
  pretty much crystal clear if you watch the video . 
  the photos with his son were taken in his siberian hometown and in moscow , ** not ** in the military camps near the border or in ukraine . 
  \u266b poland not yet lost ... \u266b, 
  the location of silo-based icbms is n't much of a secret , is it ? 
  then you have mobile icbms , which can be deployed as needed , but their bases are still pretty much known . 
  it 's not like they 're advertising the live location of ballistic missile submarines . 
  needs more ~ ~ cowbell ~ ~ \u00e7apuling ... 
  what 's going on in bulgaria ? 
  if you add all fixed-wing aircraft ( fighter , transport , utility , surveillance etc. ), 
  and helicopters you get a number in that region . 
  of course , not all are fully operational . 
  when it comes to fighters , the situation is abysmal and we ca n't rely on more than 20 or so mig-21 lancers , plus 12 f-16mlu starting q4 2016 ( which wo n't all arrive in one batch anyway ) . 
  to add to that , our pilots need more flight hours . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://youtu.be/nritydksqpq ), 
  they took err pork !, 
  * grabs pitchfork *, 
  me likey !, 
   they managed to loose entire tanks ( as in , forgot where they put them ) on several occasions how exactly do you lose tanks in peacetime , while in your own country ? 
  haha , this is damn catchy . 
  stay sane , hungary , do n't let nutters and fear mongers ruin you !, 
  because they 're first and foremost trolls * , so earning a `` few '' bob on the side while getting to be disruptive loudmouths whenever they feel like it is a damn sweet deal for them .
