  my father says that in a couple years this will become a reality but i wanted to get more information from others . 
  * what country do you live in ?

  * do you attend college classes ? 
  * what job type do you have ?

  i wanted to know how it is to live in ireland in this time and if it is in a good enough economic situation for someone to transplant to . 
  just wondering if they can improve within the next 4-5 years, 
  so i 'm starting this series to find out what you guys think is the best thing about different european countries . 
  depending on the response , i will probably continue it . 
  if bulgaria has a government like they say they have , why have n't the eu leaders stepped in and force out the old government ? 
  is it not within their jurisdiction ? 
  is it something only bulgaria can fix ? 
  ok guys , first post of the series did ok but lets see what you guys enjoy about austria !, 
  so the last part of this series did amazing ( you guys sure like your schnitzels ) so we 're going to continue with germany speaking countries and go with germany !, 
  capital of oktoberfest . 
  edit 1 : austria has been beaten by fans of germany , can any country topple this powerhouse with hundreds of fans ? 
  name countries that are n't in debt , are n't covered in corruption and just plain awesome !, 
  / r/europe what is something common that everyone in your country eats ? 
  what i mean about that is european citizens being able to move from one country to another without having to get anykind of visa, 
  i am asking this to see if any / r/europe fans have meet another / r/europe sub or possibly just another european redditor, 
  which capital city in all of europe looks the best ? 
  so now we continue with german-speaking countries , switzerland . 
  the land of watches and fancy army knives .

  a series where i choose the topic and the comment section is the discussion room . 
  anyone interested ? 
  believe it or not , some people like france , so im going to see what people love about france . 
  ** atention ** i mistyped the name of the series , it is supposed to be ` what is the best thing about ' but since i posted it in the early morning hours , i did n't type it correctly . 
  just think of this as my latest installment . 
  name a common retail store for example obi , carrefour and any other ones you can think of ( you can include fast food ), 
  are you going to stay on reddit til the early morning light filters through your 2nd floor apartment ? 
  or are you going to do something interesting !,

  how do you guys feel about president obama and john kerry 's pushing for a limited strike against syria ? 
  time for another ( hopefully ) thought provoking question , what does / r/europe think of illegal immigrants who enter your country unlawfully ? 
  i know i am a day earlier than my usually time but tomorrow i 'm going to busy during the peak time of / r/europe ( i 'm 7 hours behind main time europe ) .

  if i worded the question wrongly , i am sorry . 
  what culture do you feel is the easiest to get used to and feel integrated into ? 
  we are talking about culinary delicacies . 
  by delicacy , i mean that you see it maybe once or twice a year on the menu in your country and than when you visit another country it 's always on the menu . 
  time to find out what / r/europe likes about poland !, 
  i am asking this question because i want to see what other countries are having trouble with , or what can simply be improved . 
  by ` something ' i mean anything . 
  ex : my country needs to improve how it deals with gun laws ( talking about us , not romania ) .
