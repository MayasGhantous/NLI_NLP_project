  i always thought that remote villages were connected by some form of railway . 
  what is a schwab ? 
  it 's such a hard thing to be a fan of the national team . 
  some weeks your excited for the games to happen , and than after the game all you can do is think of how we dropped so low from the golden era team :( . 
  my family is interesting politically . 
  my grandmother likes ponta and my dad likes iohannis . 
  i feel bad for the other candidates , iohannis and ponta will probably get the majority of the votes . 
  unless i 'm wrong ofc, 
  forgot to translate content . - . 
  if you have more than 1 million dollars you pay all the taxes , and less you pay 1 % of your paycheck . 
  born in the us , but embrace the romanian culture . 
  my dad is n't gon na be very happy if he wins . 
  he 's 100 % iohannis , and thinks ponta is a communist . 
  is ponta running ? 
  my dad sure does hate ponta ... 
  he hates him a lot . 
  i declare the american republic of new romania in bucharest . 
  we do enjoy our betting do n't we ... 
  yeah , i can see why they are n't accepting a lot of people from russia/belarus , but i was thinking that since their country is going through worse and worse situations , that they might be accepted . 
  mhmm , i was thinking that is possible that it did n't work that way anymore . 
  leave russia and enter western europe and seek asylum . 
  technically first country you enter should give you asylum . 
  thats how my dad left romania . 
  edit : this is cold war era advice , so it should work in about 5 years ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
  good job again !, 
  one day i hope to see your wonderful news posts , but until then godspeed . 
  too bad i have n't seen much in judetul sibiu ... 
  i was there last year and the only progress i 've heard/seen was water pumps for sewage being brought in to the village where my dad grew up . 
  some guys stole the pumps :(, 
  but with your 2 ... 
  ima give you 3 leu . 
  thats equal to one euro . 
  my mistake , box . 
  but it 's golden . 
  i 'll trade one leu for your house, 
  now give me 10 bulgarian currencies . 
  nah you put too much work into it . 
  good job op . 
  i live in the us but i am going to germany so yes . 
  has the unemployment lowered or is it still not very wise to try and make a life there ? 
  well , i guess riots , very high unemployment , and high crime . 
  edit ; not theft < crime, 
  they have books now ? 
  is it improving there at all or is still terrible . 
  a show i have not watched, 
  maybe he meant miles . 
  is that even allowable to have a pm do that ? 
  i thought everyone hated bucharest , what is wrong with caracal ? 
  why stop at washington dc , go on to los angeles . 
  why stop at kiev when you can go all the way to warsaw, 
  i was posting it but i guess it was doing badly . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ burn ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ointment, 
  i thought they were going to let the civil war play out there . 
  what are the filipino soldiers doing in the middle east ?

  hanzel and grattel . 
  i shall name the foxes hansel and grettel . 
  where is this guy from ? 
  very nice . 
  they like their alcohol . 
  i proclaim the eastern european military anti-russian defense pact !, 
  the subreddit doesnt seem very appealing . 
  i 'm confusing myself now . 
  i do n't understand whats going on but i imagine she 's going to a maximum security prison ? 
  not gon na lie , this makes belgium seem very violent . 
  moneyland makes you sound like you come from a rich province tho . 
  i know but is n't the taxi driver the criminal in theory ? 
  the woman killed him , but he was the one who tried to rape her . 
  i imagine there is n't much room for saying it was self defense but still . 
  dang we got ta wait to have a party monsieur dngrs, 
  backwards justice . 
  especially from female judges , you 'd expect them to side with the defendant, 
  gelderland means moneyland right ?
