  i 've been in the general area of sighisoara multiple times but have n't checked it out ... 
  whats the largest store on malta ? 
  sibiu has a decent transporation system , it 's bus system covers most of where you might want to go to in sibiu . 
  you could possibly also live carfree there , but it might be difficult getting some places where bus stops are lacking . 
  you guys forgot the most important thing .

  johannis uber alles, 
  dang i got fired : c, 
  at least romania has cheap internet to be proud of . 
  so the police wo n't arrest you if you get drunk ? 
  i 've got my vacations for the next 10 years figured out . 
  i think you might need the passport at least . 
  i mean it would help morale in someways . 
  families disconnected by the seperate of bessarabia and romania could once again go back to find their lost roots . 
  i imagine life in moldova is pretty rough , and that merging back with romania would be better . . 
  i 've heard it 's the young generation that wants to merge , but the older generation thinks that they have no relation to romania . 
  i might be mixed up . 
  ukraine deserves to feel the light of democracy and peace ... 
  do you think ukraine will win ? 
  nevermind ... 
  i thought he was being pro-russian . 
  so is our intelligence chief actually a sleeper agent ? 
  lol what ?

  do n't we have to improve our infrastructure tho ? 
  i took a train from sibiu to medias back in 2010 before we had those new ` highspeed ' trains , and it took an hour to get to medias . 
  it 's a 45 minute drive by car , but i guess it 's because of stops . 
  we can make small tops and ticket vending machines in the small communes . 
  so what you 're saying is . 
  it 's bait for the small guys with state contracts ? 
  ahh ... not using money is the greatest use of money . 
  in romania it 's mostly drunk driving accidents .

  hopefully . 
  nineoclock.ro lacks some news , but thank you . 
  it 's a dirty job but someone has to do it . 
  i do n't know the good sites like you master dngrs, 
  thats wonderful !, 
  i wish i could be president and partake of silly meetings . 
  there appears to be a lack of romanian news :(, 
  mhmm . 
  so it 's actually a good thing . 
  they should just make all private universities state-funded instead of closing them . 
  so you can just sign a paper and get a degree in psychology ? 
  can i get the reasoning behind this ? 
  i do n't know how private college program affects how the college degree is taken . 
  after what they did to poor colombia , i think it was warranted . 
  i guess a european nation will win in south america . 
  so who 's not on vacation ? 
  everyone 's on vacation ? 
  i think i remember something another time regarding soldiers but it was a few months ago . 
  to be honest , i have trouble reading your news post because all of the blue links , and it feels bunched up , and i do n't know any romanian news sites except stirile pro , but i do n't know the url . 
  i know we 're in nato but i always thought that we were just used as a place to hold missiles and station troops going over to the middle east . 
  than again , i never understood how nato worked aside from being military alliance . 
  you guys were doing great but the referees were sketchy ... 
  wait there are troops from romania stationed in afghanistan ? 
  i 've also heard/read that you can study at a uni if you go to college to do a couple years of classes . 
  yeah , but we also lose the kids building up our economy ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ / u/misslola _, 
  romania has lost a large amount of intellectuals , and business men . 
  we got some back from western europe , but it 's not a large amount . 
  do you know what that something else is ?
