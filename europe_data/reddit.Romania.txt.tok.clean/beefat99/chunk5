  this looks agreeable . 
  would personal attacks go in with disagreement of someone 's views . 
  i want to be close to family in romania . 
  so i am hoping to get to germany !, 
  i can imagine this turning into a story where the thief gets acquitted for discovering a conspiracy . 
  can the thief legally do that , and does he expect to win ? 
  it was my mistake for not checking wikipedia better but i guess i did n't want to be late for people who like this series ( no one really does , but it 's ok , gives me ideas for trips ), 
  alright , next time i will simply say it was apart of yugoslavia . 
  i understand that i probably placed inaccurate information about serbia , and disrespect to the citizens . 
  it would 've been easier to just say ` hey op . 
  your information on bosnian war is incorrect , because ... ' that would 've been easier and i would 've changed it to more acceptable description . 
  it 's a simply question . 
  people who have been to serbia or like something about serbia simply say ' i like ... ' i fixed it so that you would n't be angry but i guess that ca n't be helped . 
  does this really matter ? 
  does it really ? 
  i made this to see what people like about serbia and mess up one thing and you get angered . 
  i went on wikipedia and countless other sites to avoid people getting angered . 
  ~ ~ serb forces were mostly apart of it . 
  should i just say that serbia did n't do it but their armed forces did ? ~ ~ ** edit ** : it was yugoslav army . 
  but does it really matter ? 
  it 's not even a post about history !, 
  i am subscribed , my friend and i were celebrating getting past group phase and onto the next phase, 
  marica made some magic against estonia !, 
  2 goals !, 
  i am happy we have him !, 
  i hope our offensive will hold up because well , we have no defense ( except lobont ! ), 
  well , some day romania will be that team that is already in brazil . 
  someday . 
  where 's bosnia ? 
  romania 1-0 greece sadly i am probably one of the few people who feels this optimism . 
  oh ok , i made a mistake than, 
  is n't moldovan considered another language compared to romanian ? 
  your missing [ ceausescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_ceau%c8%99escu ) for romania . 
  ( please tell me if he was n't the worst leader romania had ), 
  but it might affect them negatively, 
  this is good , romania wo n't gain all the land they once had , but they deserve to have back basarabia . 
  i am a little worried about the currency problem with moldovans because they will most likely have to change their leu to our leu/euro ( depending on when we unite ), 
  so huns are the good guys ? 
  ^ ^ no ^ ^ problem, 
  were n't the hungarians the huns that fucked with romans and the other empires ? 
  i would , but i am interested in nature more than partying lol . 
  what happens at the festival ? 
  croatia must of had a slow week . 
  i think it 's more than a while ago . 
  some people like hungary . 
  you can be so quick to judge it based on neighbors . 
  what do you ** like ** about hungary . 
  do you think chevron will get their way ? 
  how does it get so many satellites into space ? 
  ( also what is promania ? ), 
  my expectations are ruined . 
  only rosia montana has a chance at being ruined , and most of the danube is corrupted but at least the translyvanian alps are ok . 
  if they were behind the iron curtain sure but i do n't know if they were . . 
  i think latvia is doing good . 
  bosnia looks amazing . 
  i really hope they do n't ruin the natural landscape they have . 
  why ca n't you just answer this question ? 
  all i was asking is what country improved in general . 
  edit : i do n't mean any disrespect , but i just mean improved in general . 
  i did n't think that people would need to be specified . 
  you simply have multiple answers for different scenarios . 
  thats ok , i just wanted an opinion from the people . 
  this questions is n't for research as it is more for a public opinion on the subject . 
  statistically you could name the best country in the world , but it depends on the opinion of the people . 
  iron curtain is countries that were under communism and apart of the warsaw pact . 
  you just named everything that defines improved . 
  i mean the countries of czech republic and slovakia . 
  i realize that those countries do n't exist anymore but they were still under the iron curtain . 
  added it . 
  i forgot to add it . 
  their might be some eastern europeans in siberia but most returned home after stalin fell . 
  ( do n't know if that 's what you 're asking ), 
  but the fact of the matter is the minister did a good thing . 
  do n't forget the valleys that if you fall into , you will have a lot of trouble trying to get out . 
  source : a romanian tourist bus crashed into a valley near podgorica , talked about it most of the time i was in romania . 
  i am glad netherlands beat hungary , it means romania has a chance to qualify :d . 
  i found your joke interesting , but yeah , saying your not racist is like saying you are racist . 
  people will think your in denial, 
  its just the last part , i cant read it . 
  i really wish you kept it at a readable level . 
  til that the people are extremely paranoid when it comes to opening doors . 
  good guy minister : gets bribed , turns briber in . 
  i personally do n't like them , but i would like for the politicians in other eu countries to not blame us . 
  france interior minister called us out , but france has a population of 500,000 . 
  romania and bulgaria are n't the only countries with gypsies ( although we have a large amount of them ) . 
  the bigger countries in the eu have gypsies but they place the blame upon the romanians and bulgarians . 
  it shows romania for me, 
  that does need to be improved . 
  whats wrong with the press ? 
  i hope you get there one day !, 
  ( polish is a heck of a language though, 
  what is his home town ? 
  they ruin league games . 
  they make everyone leave something it was gamer lingo . 
  i do n't . 
  my polish friend said it once . 
  the series is n't what i hate about poland , it 's what you like about polska . 
  i also enjoy kurwa . 
  i wish i knew all of that : c, 
  ** romania ** * it 's snowing in october !!,
