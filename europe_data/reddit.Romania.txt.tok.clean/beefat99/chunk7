  i 'm not trying to make it impossible for the free entry . 
  i 've noticed that many romanians do n't like their country , which sometimes make me feel sad about the fact that i am one in a million who possibly like romania . 
  * tiny country , who 's best friends with switzerland ( except they got invaded ) * speak german and other languages * largest city is schwan . 
  i never did pay attention to pre-yugoslavia history ( i haven `` t reached book man , now i don `` t know . ), 
  i am literally going to check out the book on serbia today , now i know a part of it . 
  thanks for spoiling . 
  serbia is a country that was born from the remains of yugoslavia , i think it 's the strongest out of all of the other countries of former yugoslavia . 
  i guess i do n't need sleep . 
  ahhh , i thought it stood for international technical teachers ... welp , i feel alot better . 
  what is itt ? 
  and you live in kosovo ? 
  why does my thing stop at 1 month ? 
  have you gone farther ? 
  once you click `` next '' enough , it stops showing old posts . 
  so is kosovo doing ok ? 
  ** romania ** * flooding in galati 's affects 39 towns , and displaces over 6,000 people.http : / / goo.gl / maps/gpgrd * the first snow of the season fell in bucegi http://goo.gl/maps/i3p0u * a famous politician was driving 108 kph through a village , he loses his driver 's license . 
  if you fellow romanians have more news , please tell . 
  * the boy who died from stray dog has sparked debate over stray dogs . 
  [ thank you / u/realblade ], 
  thats what i was afraid of . . 
  no , i am 100 % romanian , with a grandfather who supposedly has a statue in a polish town for his doctor work . 
  i mean , all the posts from 1 month ago are gone , the mods must remove them every month . 
  i guess your username proves your strained relationship with family ? 
  i did some searching , but the posts from more than a month ago are gone , and i remember seeing something like it in may/june . 
  did n't you have a second series ? 
  serbia is nice this time of year i heard . 
  / u/taenk used to do a series like that , i do n't know what happened . 
  your province has its own president or ... 
  thats a good idea , i could use pictures but a picture of the matterhorn might be too easy to recognize :p, 
  yea , i meant great grandpa ( grandma and grandpa were children in wwii ) but sadly , i will probably never know where the town ( he has a statue : c ), 
  my parents are romanian and i have no other blood flowing through me other than romanian ( but my grandpa is supposedly famous in a polish town somewhere for his actions in wwii ), 
  northern or southern italian pizza ? 
  but the drug cartels are ok ? 
  i think poland is lovely . 
  the winters ? 
  or the ... 
  i guess united states should open their borders with mexico , and canada correct ? 
  might as well close down guard stations if you put it that way . 
  you should look for them , its nice to know your family . 
  i wish romania had a color . 
  all we have is romania ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ moldova, 
  my favorite answer , because it 's neat . 
  i wanted to see what other parts of europe ( the non-involved ones ) felt about the situation between the two of them . 
  is arges considered apart of ardeal ? 
  yep . 
  you know exactly what you want from life . 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  so cloudy and expensive ? 
  i dont have to embarrass myself this week :d, 
  im certain the polish will take over the world , not with military , but with good quality sausages and cheeses . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ supermarkets . 
  is this a polish supermarket chain ? 
  everyone knows american curse words but the second someone starts cursing in scandinavian it gets weird . 
  i just realized right now . 
  i feel dumb . 
  * they once indulged on seal meat * russia fought with them in wwii , but norwegians held out for a couple years ( not entirely sure ) * their language bros with the hungarians * they are considered most educated country in europe ( almost half of population has completed some kind of college/university ) * half the year is winter , other half is sprummerall ( i combined spring , summer and fall so it would n't take up space ) ** edit ** : i confused the finnish people with norway . 
  i guess norwegians have fancy hair color : /, 
  ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ guys ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ other ^ ^ ^ deaths ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  the dogs rarely kill people , last incident was in ' 11 . 
  but so far , i have n't heard of them doing much to stop them . 
  ukraine had the same problem , and so did belarus, 
  i forgot the mention that we need the leaders who want to put money into removing stray dogs . 
  eastern european countries have a history of corrupt leaders , and im not saying the current one is , but he is n't really focusing on removing dogs . 
  it costs money to catch dogs that are afraid of humans . 
  it also costs money to either send them to adoption facilities or get them * put to sleep *, 
  but what city do you know that has turkish people and is historic ? 
  yea !!, 
  romania has faster internet than at&t !!!, 
  ( please do n't cut my service at&t , i meant that as a liberal joke ), 
  this is a good idea , but i do n't think people would be keen on have to go on another site , record their voices ( some people do n't have mics ) and then link their recording . 
  is this good ? 
  istanbul deserves a shot , they have a historic city that is nice too . 
  i hear they have a nice country and a rising programming market ( i heard this off of / r/europe ), 
  does it affect you when going shopping ? 
  sorry i am late , i thought it was from the end of august but i rushed to put stuff together so romania does n't look empty . 
  i made the series to find out what people enjoy about every different european country . 
  ** romania ** * romania 's transport minister receives 5 years in jail in corruption case , pm ponta takes over as transport minister . 
  * minister of education eugen nicolaescu is going to introduce a new scholar program in 2014 regarding sanitation work . 
  * we had accident , 18 people were hurt , the hungarians feel better after the accident , driver was arrested . 
  * we 're raising fish that make millions of dollars ( i believe they 're sturgeon ) ** have a nice day **, 
  how nice ? 
  ; _ ; america is forever alone with universal health care i guess . 
  i forget , does ireland have universal health care ? 
  yea ... 
  it 's sad to be honest . 
  if you 're from romania then your life story will be exactly the same as my father 's, 
  australia , always breaking cars down ... 
  wild carpathia capture romania 's ecological side , but not sure about cities . 
  i guess his car broke down for a couple months . . 
  romanian sounds like spanish , so i enjoy watching spanish people argue and then when they say a world similar to ours i almost exactly sorta know what they 're arguing about . 
  my god ... your right !, 
  you 're going from romania ( pretty bad at the moment ) to spain ( which is also pretty bad ), 
  if moldova rejoins , will it be the besarabian province ? 
  is this a sign of reunification / u/bezbojnicul, 
  ** romania ** * little girl ( 8 years old ) killed by a horse in timis ( the county ) * two boats collided on the danube near the village of mila , one man missing * in bucharest , there is a possibility for there to be hail and rain the next couple of days * a chauffeur hit and killed a man in bihor ( province ) , the man 's son was sent to the hospital in grave condition * a chauffeur was driving 212 kph on translvanian highway this has been , news by a romanian living in america . 
  is it because poland is doing ok with out the eu ? 
  i heard some countries do n't want to join eu because their doing well on their own . 
  mhmm ... 
  so eu not equal to eurozone ? 
  i confused schengen area with eurozone with eu did n't i. . . well i guess it 's a negative since i dont get 3x the amount of lei when exchanging,
