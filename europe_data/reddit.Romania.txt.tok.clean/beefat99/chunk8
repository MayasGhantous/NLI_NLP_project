  we do n't despise modern day russia do we ? 
  we despise the soviet union , but then again they did take moldova away from us ^ ^ ^ ^ soon, 
  now i can move to germany without needing a visa whilst retaining my romanian citizenship, 
  so is it a slow week for romania ? 
  no one posted romanian news ( i do n't know the sites and do n't live in romania at the moment ), 
  so im guessing your parents are n't born there ... 
  if they were , you could be a certified czech republic citizen :d, 
  keep up the awesome work modomario and maybe this will become the new series that people love !, 
  its amazing how you are able to find new information everyday !, 
  but if your referring to the posts on / r/romania , i was asking a question to see if people knew any information on the topic . 
  this is a self post ? 
  im just asking a question to see what people see as a positive of being european . 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't have a major in english so i just use straightforward questions !, 
  well / u/nashrol , let me explain why i would like a federal european government . 
  think of it like this , when you are by yourself , you tend to be at risk more from your enemies , now most of modern europe does n't have enemies ( other then your average terrorist group ) but , they 're still at risk by being alone . 
  if greece had n't joined the eu , it could 've had more problems , greece might 've shutdown even more social services just to survive until the end of the year . 
  im not saying it 's smart for germany , france and other eu countries to dish out money for it 's countries with bad economies and problems . 
  but would you want illegal greek civilians running from it 's failing country to the rest of europe and illegally integrating themselves into society ? 
  eu basically allows greece the chance to repair it 's self ( even if it 's not a good chance of that happening as of now ) while also providing the schengen area which allows free travel for greek citizens who want to find a better life in western europe while providing the countries with skilled working individuals to improve their work force . 
  as of right now , the eu has more positives then negatives . 
  but who knows , in a couple years maybe the eu will not be as good as i say it is . 
  if we all learn to work together and help each other , then europe can become the new america ( without the gun crimes ), 
  the older people i believe are the ones that are trying to bring europe together because they see the strength the united states has because it 's a united country , and their a young country . 
  but europe has been divided for decades before the forming of eu and it has n't be able to achieve what america was able to achieve due to decades of bad blood between countries . 
  romania and hungary dislike each other , just to name an example . 
  my dad can come up with stranger romanian ones . 
  so thats why my cousin said to talk to girls ... 
  i thought he was just being racist . 
  welp . 
  not sure if any other romanians say it , but it 's basically comparing bears = white and bees to another minority . 
  in romania we say bears and bees, 
  bonjour / u/quas4r , enjoy bioshock , it 's a good game ( want to know the ending ? ), 
  oh you know . 
  since im in florida , im just watching the sunset while wishing my cousin was awake to teach me more about the bees and the bears . 
  how did you start your morning then ? 
  some coffee and vegimite ? 
  good night uk . 
  good point . 
  greek-hater , sure they 're doing terribly economically but they deserve some respect . 
  this should be a series, 
  that they have a queen , and 3 princes , and 1 princess , and that prince harry lost his spot to the throne to his nephew ( i heard he mad ), 
  i guess you do n't want to be friends ... thats ok, 
  we 're kind of the same ... 
  i want to move to europe , you 're kind of in europe but want to move inwards ... we could be friends . 
  so do you live in england ? 
  or are you english but living in some other country dreaming of other countries . 
  are you from munchen ? 
  ( i do n't know how to add the umluats ), 
  but your a rich basterd, 
  you live in the country of ` mods are pretty cool guys ' ? 
  we 're friends ? 
  i-i do n't know what to say !, 
  i mean this happened so quickly !, 
  ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ are n't ^ ^ ^ lying ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  romania is n't a country for a guy grown up in a democracy , parents probably can tell that if i transplanted there , i would have a harder time . 
  i thought carrefour is a german store, 
  i just messed up the name of the series today , it was a mistake, 
  you forgot snail caviar and their suckling pig intestines, 
  but i do n't see why they would n't be supportive , im not copying the country / u/taenk did this week , im avoiding posting on the same day ( my mistake last friday ) and it does n't have anything to do about learning new information about a country . 
  but their different series , im not doing a ` what do you know series ' , im just simply doing a ` what do you like about ' series, 
  they really do n't like france ... 
  [ before i left this was popular in romania , summer 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80m0fofqnqi ), 
  i would move to germany since i can do my higher education and i can be closer to my family in romania . 
  it was a little better but it was unorganized, 
  moldova was once romania . 
  im 100 % romanian ... just living in another country . 
  that happens to not have only my parents and younger brother with me as the only family . 
  yea im most likely biting off more then i can chew , but i thought i had a good idea for a series . 
  i must be easy to see that im not a `` full time romanian ... ^ ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ ^ part ^ ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ ^ romanians ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ feelings ^ ^ ^ ^ too ... 
  just remember we will always be better then bulgaria . 
  :d , as a american-romanian , i have a goal to see every city , village and community in romania . 
  might take me a while though, 
  that was woosh ? 
  i that that was meant to be s.u.a , i have family in judetul sibiu !, 
  ^ ^ ^ does ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ country ^ ^ ^ bother ^ ^ ^ you ? 
  yea i guess great minds think alike , sadly im slow when coming up with ideas . 
  back to coming up with a new series . 
  nvm i forgot they had one already . 
  which judet do you live in multu ? 
  thats true, 
  do n't say that , i believe romania just got the shitty hand with communism and the russians . 
  we will get the good hand soon . 
  ^ ^ soon ^ ^ my ^ ^ brothers, 
  i would but i suck at making colorful things . 
  i would like to show / r/europe what an american born romanian loves about the country that hundreds of other romanians despise . 
  why ca n't romanians have some cool on / r/images ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  example : american w / polish citizenship wants to move to europe , which country would be easiest for him to move too ? 
  what romanians in sibiu ( city in central romania ) is basically ignore them , you do n't give them any acknowledgement and you wo n't lose your wallet . 
  they have mountains . 
  its a nice but tiny country . 
  not a lot of big cities . 
  well they could deport them maybe back to romania , but they 're basically indians ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ indians ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ romania ^ ^ look ^ bad, 
  woahahahahaha , my aunt 's favorite mallard got stolen by gypsies , they steal livestock in the countryside and in the cities are avid for their pickpocketing , they 're a lazy group of people who steal to make their living .
