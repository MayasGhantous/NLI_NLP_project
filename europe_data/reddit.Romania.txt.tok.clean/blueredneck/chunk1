do not lose heart , brother . 
  i 'm positive that hungary too would be welcome in our glorious union . 
  it gets even weirder , if you think that an ancient form of the word is * r\u0103zbel * , combining the slavic * razboj * with the latin * bellum * . 
  it 's one thing to subsidize , or refuse to subsidize , art in general , and a completely different thing to cease funding and close specific art schools because they do n't conform to one 's ideology . 
  if the guy saying `` sa traiasca novorossia '' ( long live novorossia ) is a native romanian speaker , then i 'm a pink flying monkey . 
  it 's the means through which the balkan female establishes territoriality . 
  the balkan single male does n't generally use doilies , unless he still lives with his parental units . 
  love the doilies . 
  yeah , the_donald started astroturfing far-right subs targeted at various european countries . 
  all of them in english . 
  they have a yuge surprise incoming . 
  he deleted the tweets . 
  the diplomatic principles were respected . 
  also , the almodovar effect . 
  never discount the influence well-made movies have on people . 
  putin the pacifist, 
  it works because it 's an irish news site , as conveyed by its domain ( . ie ) . 
  no wonder euroscepticism is on the rise in hungary . 
  i used that phrase only because op also used it . 
  i think it 's more complex than that . 
  yes , sometimes , as a defense mechanism , together with the feel of distinctiveness also comes pride . 
  but there is also more than a bit of projection going on , especially from people from southern romania and from around bucharest . 
  with all due respect , * different * = / = * superior * . 
  i do not `` feel superior '' to my fellow romanians . 
  i do feel though that there is a transylvanian distinctivness , transcending ethnic identity , which is worth preserving . 
  is that such a offensive thing ? 
  sorry , but i do n't believe you . 
  your own comment history contradicts you . 
  that only makes you even more conflicted . 
  i guess we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  i just find bizarre this compulsion to convince europe that you 're doing the right thing by getting away as much as possible from the same europe . 
  leaving -- possibly , and the earliest -- sometime after 2020 . 
  that is a long time . 
  the fact that brexiteers find it necessary to state that in every . 
  thread . 
  makes me think they 're really trying to convince * themselves * it 's true . 
  sure . 
  but still , only half plus 2 % , compared with the half minus 2 % who said the exact opposite . 
  the mandate is by no means so powerful as some describe it . 
  half plus two percent of the public . 
  if his job was to push his country into a ditch , he surely did that magnificently . 
  another unflattering russia-connected post being buried in downvotes . 
  i guess those rabid russophobes from the european court of human rights had it coming . 
  belgians * are * french anyway , as they speak french , n'est pas ? 
  it 's certainly not revolutionary but it has modernist elements and it should probably be judged in context . 
  compared to catholic or protestant church architecture , eastern orthodox church architecture is extremely conservative . 
  you obviously never visited romania . 
  god , i hope you 're wrong . 
  also , taiwan . 
  and lately hong-kong . 
  edit : add to that xi jinping incipient personality cult . 
  that 's probably as good a definition of the alt-right as any : `` populist , not overtly racist , but all racists recognize it as being in their corner . '', 
  he 's just a figurehead . 
  he just happened to be in the right place ( leader of a small eurosceptic party ) , at the right time ( when the actual brexit opinion leaders , people like lord rothermere and rupert murdoch , decided the eu goes against their personal interests ) . 
  after how 2016 went , boring is just fine , thank you . 
  to be fair , they 're also called * huniazi * ( hunyads , literally ) , and the castle * castelul huniazilor * ( hunyads ' castle ) . 
  edit : the family also gave its name to the city -- hunedoara in romanian , vajdahunyad in hungarian . 
  there also is a smaller town near cluj called huedin/b \u00e1nffyhunyad , but apparently with a different etymology . 
   no natural borders that 's more the ( insincere and slightly paranoid ) rationalization of an already existing policy than its cause . 
  in the particular case of georgia , what more of a natural border than the caucasus mountains ( elbrus peak , 5642 m , right on the border ) should russia have in order to feel safe ? 
  edit : explaining the `` insincere and paranoid '' characterization . 
  it 's insincere because russia reached then went beyond `` natural border lines '' repeated times in its expansion . 
  the urals , the caucasus , every north-south oriented siberian and east-european river , the central-asian deserts , all are possible natural borders reached and then overtaken by russia . 
  even the huge northern european and siberian plains , transformed every spring and autumn in endless bogs and every winter in frozen wastelands , constitute in themselves natural borders . 
  it 's paranoid because almost none ( barring china ) of russia 's neighboring countries have either the resources or the inclination to threaten russia . 
  in the case of romania , i think it references this : https://thevelvetrocket.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/soldiers-1989-romanian-revolution.jpg, 
  is it , though ? 
  the indoctrination mechanism is the same . 
  it uses the same social media propagation means , the same imagery of the community under siege , the same exalted and paranoid vocabulary , the same vilification of mainstream ideas , the same exploitation of underlying social problems . 
  romanians definitely do n't like to mince their words . 
  sarcasm and , well , bluntness are appreciated qualities . 
  that , btw , can cause quite the culture shock when they , especially if young and green , enter english-speaking online forums . 
  a guy confused by something will look at it `` like a calf at a new [ barn ] door '' ( ca vi\u021belul la poarta nou\u0103 ) . 
  a dude who is overwhelmed will not keep up because `` you can not make a whip out of dung '' ( nu po\u021bi face din rahat bici ) . 
  a guy performing beneath his potential does it because he 's `` good cheese in a dogskin bag '' ( br\u00e2nz\u0103 bun\u0103 \u00een burduf de c\u00e2ine ) . 
  a slightly different paradigm around here . 
  in romanian they say `` are cap doar s\u0103 nu-i plou\u0103-n g\u00e2t '' ( `` he has a head just so it does n't rain into his neck '' ) . 
  probably because supporters of m\u00e9lenchon , who tend to be young , stayed at home . 
  david cameron . 
  theresa may . 
  mark rutte . 
  george w. bush . 
  etc , etc , etc. 
  all of them on the right . 
  none of them called fascists . 
  that 's a quite out-of-the-blue remark . 
  i was not talking about my ideology , but about the one espoused by the alt-right , in my opinion . 
  and in a passive-aggressive way you are confirming that i was right . 
   globalists are only the `` global elite '' that are against everything the common people want . 
  historically , when referring to the protest movements of the '90s and ' 00s , you are right . 
  but in more recent times `` globalist '' has been co-opted by the alt-right and acquired a new dog-whistle resonance . 
  when alt-righters talk about `` filthy globalist merkel '' , and that 's quite frequent , they 're not thinking about her generally `` going against the will of the common people '' . 
  they refer specifically to her suposedly letting dirty non-european refugees defile glorious europe . 
  `` ipochimen '' means `` individual '' , `` character '' . 
  it 's generally used when referring to someone eccentric or unsavoury . 
  edit : `` arvun\u0103 '' means `` down payment '' , `` advance '' . 
   the pan-european stoxx 600 index fell 0.2 percent , ** after hitting a 20-month high in the previous session . 
  ** france 's cac fell 0.3 percent , ** off wednesday 's nine-year high . 
   as a state , russia is immensely wealthy . 
  they can keep flogging those natural resources for decades to come .
