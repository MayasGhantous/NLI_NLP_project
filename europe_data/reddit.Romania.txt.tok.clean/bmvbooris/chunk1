after more than two decades , some 300 million kebabs at about 6 euros each are eaten in 10,200 outlets in france maybe they should warn as to why the fuck a kebab is 6 $ in france . 
  is it just me or is that very expensive . 
  currently live in austria and you can get them ( decent ones ) from 3.5 $ up . 
  they are protesting because next time they might have to pay 0.5 $ to see all the karma they get, 
  is the cap per individual or per subscription ? 
  i mean do you / u/bazmeg have to pay 2.5 $ for all your subscriptions or for each one ? 
  edit : i 'm thinking of this situation : 1 land internet connection used for pc , one mobile connection ( 3g ) for smartphone . 
  you use 100 gb on the computer and 2 gb on the smartphone . 
  do you pay 2.5 $ or 3.5 $ ( 2.5 $ for pc and 0.5 $ x2 for phone ) edit 2 : changed device to subscription . 
  and thanks for the answer ,

  [ who 's winning ? 
  basically the same thing here in romania !, 
  i assume you also do it around christmas ? 
  god i love these traditions !, 
  when i was a child my task was to hold the pig by the tail when it was killed !, 
  afterwards i would get to eat the ears and the pig skin ( after it was burned and clean ) . 
  i just loved the atmosphere  of course , growing up it gets even better since now i can also drink palinca and hot wine !, 
  it 's in the album description ( res does not display that apparently )  the survey was conducted from september 10 to 15 , on a representative sample of 1,085 people over 18 years with a maximum permissible error of + / - 3 % data at a confidence level of 95 percent, 
  sorry , for some reason imgur kept bothering me with the album settings and i missed it when translating it . 
  i changed it now !, 
  in included the source in the album description , but if the mods need it again , [ here it is !, 
  in my case russian . 
  because i 'm romanian and my name is boris ( which btw is bulgarian in origin ), 
  nah , i do n't think it will work . 
  the albanians will quickly reinforce their bunkers at the first sign of trouble !, 
  since their last removal project they figured out that sending kebab to their neighbors is much faster than removing them internally, 
  these have to be the classiest chimney sweepers i have ever seen, 
  here i disagree with you . 
  the purpose of a judge is to decide if a person is guilty of a crime . 
  if then person is guilty that his/her job is to give a sentence based on the severity of the crime , not the social implications of that crime . 
  what did the accused do ? 
  did he just touched the child ? 
  - lower sentence did he rape the child ? 
  - higher sentence did the rape the child multiple times ? 
  - even higher sentence these are the things a judge should take into account when giving a sentence . 
  it is not the fault of the accused that the peers of the victim are so intolerant . 
  his fault was committing the crime for which he presents a danger to society . 
  prison sentences are seen as a mean to make an individual understand he did something wrong and maybe to reintegrate them in society ( if possible ) . 
  there are not seen as a revenge for the suffering of the victim . 
  even if they were why would he have to pay for the suffering that was endured at the hands of other ( the child 's fellow peers ) ? 
  let me put it another way . 
  if you were driving at night and hit a woman with your car ( assuming she survives ) , do you think it 's normal to get a longer sentence because her family thinks it 's not ok for women to walk outside at night and therefore they are shaming her ? 
  or do you thing it 's normal to get the sentence based on the fact that you were not paying attention and hit a human ? 
   the shaming of the victims and their families done by their peers is what 's aggravating the situation and who 's fault is that exactly ? 
  the perpetrator 's or the fellow peers of the family ? 
  why must the perpetrator be punished more because of how some group views his crime ? 
  his crime is hideous , i get that , but there is no justification for the increased sentence . 
  are we next going to force harsher punishments on a muslim drunk driver because his religion forbids him drinking alcohol ? 
  as opposed to the regular punishment someone else will get ? 
  let me guess , lack of cycling lanes ?

  loved the joke , 
  given the daily mail 's stance on migration and the eu , am i the only one who thinks the entire staff jizzed in their pants upon hearing the news ? 
  just say you are a former member of the church of scientology and that you feel the church is out to get you because you left . 
  that should get you asylum !, 
  oh , if i could upvote more than once !, 
  best comment of the day !, 
  by his logic , butthurt thracian ? 
  you must be new to this subreddit . 
  we 've had this flair for a long time . 
  the science is strong with this one !!!, 
  thanks , 
  i like how the first comment was about the general pessimism of hungarians and your reply is that it will never get any better : ), 
  well , we call ourselfs *** roman *** ians with our capital in bucharest and not rome  ^ ^ ^ ^ yet !, 
  it 's official , then !, 
   so much for democracy and liberty in the old world you do realize that upvoting or downvoting is basically a democratic process , right ? 
  as for liberty , unless you are shadowbanned you have the right to express yourself and the rest of / r/europe has the right to democratically upvote or downvote you !, 
  also , in my personal opinion comments defending greece are downvoted but comments defending greece 's proposal or solutions are not . 
  [ of happenings !!!, 
  dave cameron does n't do what dave cameron does for dave cameron . 
  dave cameron does what dave cameron does because dave cameron is ... dave cameron . 
   offtopic : why the odd font ? 
  is that a greek thing ? 
  same thing i thought when i first saw it . 
  that is a really weird font and the usage of different sizes for emphasis makes it harder to read . 
  just using bold would have been enought, 
  i am genuinely surprised by the lack of catalans asking the rest of spain just how much greek-like behavior do they have to impersonate before the spanish can let them secede, 
  dude , we in romania have vampires !, 
  i 'm just saying , if your plan for the greeks does n't work out you can try with us , 
  someone please photoshop tsipras ' face on this !, 
  and while your at it do the same for varoufakis . 
  we could use it every time there is news about the creditors proposing a new deal for greece !, 
   / u/strukkstar [ 2 ] question might not have been well formulated that 's why i said  serbia is n't `` closing it 's borders '' i think he wanted to know how many serbians will profit from this not that  serbia is n't `` closing it 's borders '' which is a valid point . 
  some will profit . 
  it 's just that his question was not well put, 
   i am just carrying 10 syrians in my backpack as i write this what a noob !, 
  if you get [ two of these ] ( http://fs72.trilulilu.ro/imgs/ioana_j/3-plase-de-rafie_803708be0b4a63.jpg?size=original ) you can easily smuggle 30 syrians !, 
  on a serious note , / u/strukkstar question might not have been well formulated but chances are some serbians will smuggle the immigrants . 
  it 's just like with the cigarette smuggling from serbia , ukraine and moldova into romania and hungary ( not sure here , maybe a hungarian can confirm ) . 
  if there is enough incentive people will smuggle . 
  and it 's not just the serbians , but probably romanians , hungarians , etc. 
  will do it too . 
  out of curiosity . 
  do you know anyone who had their license revoked for 15 years ? 
  what would someone have to do to get it revoked for that long ? 
  edit : also , what 's the legal limit in poland ? 
  does n't every country have something like this ? 
  in romania we say something like : romania is such a beautiful country .
