  you have say no to bulgaria/romania in the schengen when i hover over your flag . 
  you definitely take it way to personal . 
  did you have some bad experience with romanians in the past ? 
  or you never traveled outside the uk and you 're an avid daily mail reader ? . 
  or you 're just a sad troll looking for attention ? 
  which one is it ? 
  edit : spelling, 
  this kind of answer is what he wants from people . 
  the anti romania guy is here . 
  why do you say romania/bulgaria/hungary are shit ? 
  the basis that romania is a eu member and it 's citizens should at least have the same rights as the citizens of other eu countries . 
  is that to far stretched ? 
  edit : spelling, 
   he added that romania is merely demanding the same treatment as the czech republic , for whom visa requirements will be lifted in the coming days . 
  it seams fair to me . 
  although i do n't think they 'll actually block the trade deal if canada does n't lift visas . 
  well i did my share . 
  just bought a bike . 
  some ethnic romanians steal abroad and some roma people do n't steal . 
  do n't generalize, 
  rural parts, 
  do n't make it personal with op . 
  the issue is about other european citizens ( romanians and bulgarians in this case ) being mistreated . 
  8 out of 10 cats never mind the buzzcocks mock the week, 
  elections are coming i believe . 
  so no . 
  romania has flourishing it sector from what i know . 
  yeah but when it happens to men it 's considered funny . 
  it 's actually 9,642,383 internet users [ link ] ( http://www.internetworldstats.com/europa.htm ) you where close . 
  i think i 'm gon na switch to the 200mbit/s option or the 500mbs/s one , they look the most appealing right now . 
  i currently have the 50mb/s option with 6.5 euros a month,

  lets hope it stays that way . 
  that shit is horrible, 
  lovely, 
   is there anyone here with firsthand experience ( that does n't involve gypsies for a change ) that actually benefited from it ? 
  what exactly do you mean by that ? 
  russia 's technique reminds me of this [ david michel on bullies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmv8myyezlk ), 
  this needs a polandball, 
   it was the best part of the summer . 
  yeah especially when that dried chaff got onto your sweaty skin . 
  oh god the itching . 
  the majority are slavic names . 
  i might be wrong . 
  both of my names are slavic for sure . 
  well it 's under construction . 
  the asphalt is good but it does n't have canal drainage and parapet on a lot of sections .

  you can add [ transalpina ] ( http://www.dcnews.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/transalpina-1.jpg ) to your list, 
  stephen fry , love listening to that guy . 
  i read a sci fi story when i was little about this subject . 
  it was about some robotic birds built by man to enforce the law . 
  and the birds reinterpreted the law and started killing humans , so humans made another model of birds to kill the first ones . 
  they started killing the first model until one day when they realized that humans are the real problem . 
  sorry i know it 's of the topic , but now i want to know the author and the title of that story . 
  saw him live . 
  that man can mix !,

  bill hicks was a great guy, 
  they looked at the receipt . 
  well thank you for enlightening me , now i see the error of my ways . 
  well i could have called you a racist piece of shit moron , to get my point across ... but i try to keep it civilized . 
  you could have made your point without calling me an idiot , tough guy . 
  what do you mean so fuckin what ? 
  ! ... in your mind it 's ok to treat and exploit others as slaves ? 
  be that as it may , but we still used them as slaves . 
   they are making problems to every society they get a grasp of . 
  i know they are causing problems , i 'm not daft . 
  my point is that perpetuating the racism an hatred towards another group does n't tend to solve the problems said group causes it only alienates them further . 
  need i remind you that they where bought here in europe as slaves viewed with inferiority and treated as subhuman so give them a fuckin break . 
  no wonder they do n't want to integrate . 
  spreading the hatred towards gypsies does n't help anybody . 
  only the hollywood ones do, 
   it does not make us any more or any less racist than we already were . 
  and we are . 
  very much agree . 
  i 've heard people who went abroad the came back complaining about being discriminated because they are from romania and then going `` this is because the fucking gypsies i hate them so much '' . 
  we do n't do n't like being discriminated against yet we discriminate all the time . 
  trailer for [ wild carpathia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip_qzabfxqm ), 
  this is for all europe [ wild europe ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449012/combined ), 
  the ignorance is strong in this one, 
   that said , every country who ever experienced gypsies , has developed the phrase `` do n't be a gypsy or do n't gypsy '' you have any examples of that ? 
  just curious . 
   you 'll need a big machine to build big buildings , any way you slice it . 
  yes i agree . 
   how much more energy do they use ? 
  what about repairs ?
