  well they are probably inefficient right now that 's why you do n't see them replacing humans . 
  my point is it 's a new technology worth keeping your eye on for the future . 
   then you still would have to build and move the bulky printing machine . 
  they 're bulky now cause they are in early development stages . 
  i 'm sure with time they will become smaller and easier to transport . 
  more like [ this ] ( http://www.designboom.com/technology/mataerial-anti-gravity-3d-printer-by-petr-novikov-sasa-jokic-joris-laarman/ ) and les like the one in the article . 
   i agree that there is a nich for complex shapes , but what does `` efficient '' mean ? 
  efficient in terms of the amount of material used to achieve the same structural properties as conventional methods . 
  something similar [ link ] ( http://www.archdaily.com/335887/3-d-printing-protohouse-1-0-and-protohouse-2-0-softkill-design/ ) to this, 
   how is it more efficient to transport brick powder and let a printer turn it into bricks somewhere , rather than just transporting the bricks ? 
  they probably would n't transform the material into bricks . 
  they 'd transform the material into walls . 
  you eliminate labor costs and you can do it much faster . 
  also the shapes you can create with 3d printing are much more complex and efficient that with conventional methods . 
  that first comment . 
  there 's always one guy . 
  washing the dishes in winter is fun .

  he looks like he 's seen some shit, 
   this is a debt owed since 1944 of 1.126 billion reichsmark is it oil money , or where does the debt come from ? 
  i think he 's referring to this [ link ] ( http://images.wikia.com/gameofthrones/images/archive/b/b6/20110428212624!eddard_promo.jpg ), 
  what 's so great about him ? 
  we sure love them churches . 
  fuck health , science and education , just build more churches and everything will be fine . 
  the man is 83 . 
  but it 's nice to know you ca n't run away from your past even after all that time . 
   it 's only used when you argue with somebody . 
  you do argue a lot . 
  with bullets, 
  i 'd say corruption and lack of infrastructure . 
  but there are a lot of other things that we have to work on . 
  haha :-) thank you for making me laugh . 
  somewhere in between poland and ukraine . 
  my guess is that romania 's image will gradually change for the better as the years go by . 
  edit : spelling, 
  the third part is always the shittiest, 
  and two or three weeks ago 18 romanian tourists died in a bus crash in montenegro . 
  edit : spelling, 
  he 's not talking about flairs...he-s talking about reddit mascot on the top left .

   copying hungary i see ? 
  i thought ponta was on the opposite side of the political spectrum to orban . 
  actually he tweeted that he is opposed to that particular section of the new constitution [ link ] ( https://twitter.com/victor_ponta/status/343293374125703168 ), 
  or maybe he is just born in '88, 
  awesome . 
  thank you very much,

  stephen fry . 
  i could listen to him for hours on end and not get bored . 
  my mom 's been doing this for 7 years now , i ca n't imagine not having home made food in the fridge . 
  some day they 're gon na stop coming . 
  the urban plan states that the area is for residential buildings , but yeah it 's probably gon na be church . 
  every time the economy slows down central banks react by decreasing interest rate just to keep people borrowing money . 
  that gives the impression of growth when actually people keep accumulating debt . 
  that 's what happened with the housing bubble . 
  the bailout bubble is when entire governments keep accumulating debt just to keep their economies afloat and central banks keep lowering the interest rate just to keep them borrowing . 
  soon banks wo n't lower their interest rates any more and governments wo n't be able to borrow and everything will come to a dead stop . 
  thant 's my take on it . 
  i 'm sure the matter is far more complicated that this . 
  only the big towers and the factory behind is demolished . 
  the rest still stands . 
  from what i understand the plot is for sale, 
  background story ?
