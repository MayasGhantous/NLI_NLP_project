  so the bailout bubble is about to burst soon . 
   64 % of pakistanis and egyptians if you would take into account all the muslims from around the world i bet the percentage would be much lower . 
  i like architecture and design , i always did ... i continued studying electrical engineering just to have safety net i guess but in the process i started enjoying it more and more . 
  also you can combine the two  . 
  my masters was focused more on renewable energy sources . 
  well i was in my second year at electrical engineering when i started studying architecture . 
  after four years of bachelors i did my masters witch was two years , witch i 've finished last year . 
  i just turned 25 . 
  i study architecture fifth year ( in romania ) , but i also have a masters degree in electrical engineering .

  the fact that they arrested two judges ?!, 
  what would be the alternative ? 
  not arresting them . 
  or not finding out ? 
  corruption is not a criteria of admission in the schengen area . 
  but that is another discussion . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  or in 2000, 
  olanda is in romanian, 
  they look nice . 
  trucks with goods wont spend so many hours at the border control . 
  and it 's your cake day ... you 're on a roll today, 
  i bet you are fit, 
  is n't it a bit ... late ? 
  i 'd first ban everyone who was involved with the securitate and the communist party at higher levels form politics . 
  but but last summer you said we can join ... why the sudden change of heart ? 
  fixed, 
  i just google gay bar cluj napoca ( transilvania ) . 
  here you go http://delirio.ro/ there may be more . 
   maybe tell your fellow countrymen to stop fucking shit up what the heck are you talking about ? ... schengen for day to day people means not having to show your id at the border not a passport just an id card . 
  it 's just that , it 's a minor inconvenient for people who want to travel abroad . 
  people who want to steal and pillage can easily go across the border no questions asked with or whot out schengen . 
  schengen are means freedom of movement for businesses , trucks with goods do n't have to spend hours on end to get checked when transporting goods in and out of romania . 
  and germany was pro until last summer when our government changed , since then they'are against . 
  edit : spealing, 
  sorry . . i do n't know what came over me . 
   good fuck you to . 
  oh boy ... here we go . 
  the wall was intended for children playing in the area and always running on the road .

  i 'll be at your door step . 
  i think it 's just / u/beanfart or / u/ufrustratedbro, 
   romania sold its bonds at a much better rate than we did that does n't say much . 
  romania is considered an emerging economy with some potential , hence the low interest rate . 
  even better then ,

  my point is you 're a troll . 
  go do something useful with your life . 
  stop wasting everyone 's time, 
  you again . 
  have n't seen you in a while . 
  came here to troll some more ? 
  it still is, 
  well it 's a small step in the right direction , but a step nonetheless, 
  they get to read articles like this , that 's why , but then again so do the danes and the finns . 
  edit spelling, 
  usually monotheistic religions are much authoritarian that polytheistic religions . 
  christianity is just as guilty in this case as islam and as judaism . 
  it 's just a personal opinion . 
  it seems strange that you have all that cctv to keep people safe . 
  yet you can cover your face up so no one can identify you . 
  cause then . 
  video cameras are pointless . 
  they ca n't protect your anything . 
  edit : spelling, 
  question . 
  why is it legal to wear that in public ( in the uk ) ? 
  i 'm not speaking from a religion/cultural perspective , just from a security point of view , cause you can get away with stuff if you keep your face covered at all time . 
  maybe it 's just a fashion thing . 
  like in [ norway ] ( http://onepiece.com/ro/mens/jumpsuits ) . 
  edit : spelling, 
  so gangster from east london then, 
  is iceland european?i mean geographically . 
  is n't it half in europe and half in america ?
