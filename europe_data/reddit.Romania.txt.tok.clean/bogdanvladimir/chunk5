  i 'm guessing you are referring to bihor and satu mare county but i 'm not sure there are meaningful separatist groups over there if there are any at all . 
  if there are extremists there . 
  it 's israel 's fault to,

  you 're gon na have to make a new account cause this one is compromised, 
  he 's a troll . . do n't feed him, 
  yes . 
  we get defensive and angry when we are being discriminated abroad yet we discriminate all sorts of minorities here in romania, 
  everybody wants a piece of the western life style, 
  romania has different regions influenced by different cultures along the history, 
  i always wondered who was the first person who actually started boo'ing . 
  i would like to meet him and say thank you . 
  you again,

  architect ?

   israel performs really bad . 
  that 's an understatement, 
   i do not want to rely on the voting power o the mainly uneducated non-secular masses of eastern europe or turkey . 
  uneducated ... do n't know...non-secular . 
  [ no ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/secularmap.png ) edit : red : states with no state religions orange : states with state religions grey : no data or ambiguous, 
  icre negro crap, 
  in romania the biggest i know are . 
  otherwise it will be stolen ... we get it , very funny . 
  i was n't suggesting that mods check every downvoter to see if they commented . 
  i 'm was thinking that there must be a way to block the downvote button until you reply . 
  but i do n't know any programming so i have no ideea if that is even possible . 
  we can make a poll to see if people would agree . 
  i have a better suggestion . 
  you ca n't downvote untill you reply to the person in cause . 
  you are talking sense man . 
  yes , that one to .

   but also indo-european like romanians . 
  romania is not the only indo-european nation on the continent . 
  [ link ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/indoeuropeantree.svg ) if you you look closely romania and romani are on the oposite branches of indo-european languages . 
   no , you 're wrong [ 1 ] . 
  the link i provided says otherwise . 
   romania has a historical duty towards roma due to slavery and the holocaust and it 's far from repaying it . 
  you 're joking . 
  right ? 
  many countries have historical duties to ethnic minorities ... from what i know romania is not responsible for the holocaust . 
  a lot of gypsies were deported from romania during the holocaust . 
  but other ethnic/religious minorities suffered the same faith . 
  romanians were enslaved ( they were treated like second class citizens ) by the austro-hugarian , rusian , ottoman empire and many others do we have the right to get their countries just because . 
  no not really . 
  and by your logic . 
  germany should give their country to the jews . 
  or any country that has a history of enslaving people . 
  that 's not how things work, 
   for a start both are indo-european people and romanian culture is more oriental and southern while hungarian culture is more central europe . 
  i asked for articles anything backing up your statement . 
  you just wrote another personal opinion . 
  romas are of asian descent middle-eastern . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) . 
   do you disagree ? 
  you presumed that romania has the largest population of romas . 
  factually speaking romania does n't have the largest roma population [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) i think we should better integrate them . 
  some countries including romania made the first steps in the right direction . 
  anyway . 
  i think you 're a troll . 
  inflaming discussions .
