   yes , but romanis culturally have more in common with romanians than hungarians . 
  any reliable source backing up that statement . 
  or is just your personal opinion ? 
  romania like many european countries has been influenced by it 's neighbors . 
  transilvania for example was for aprox 400 years under austro-hungarian , habsburgic empire . 
  so there are a lot ethnic hungarians and germans living here . 
  the other regions as well otomans , rusians ... the lot . 
  but assuming that hungarian romas have more in common with romanians then hungarians it 's pretty ignorant if you ask me . 
  you do know all countries have roma minorities . 
  should they all live in romania ? 
  yeah but that 's not the point ... they 're not sheep . 
  you ca n't just hurdle them around as you please, 
   deport them to romania ?? 
  why would they deport hungarian romas to romania ? 
  yeah ... it would n't really work with current speed . 
  one small step ... buffering ... kind, 
  this is how i hope the first human landing on mars will be seen ... live on youtube, 
  looks amazing, 
  so where do you think dose people who travel to uk will go if uk closes it 's borders ? 
  it 's not speculation ... it how the banking system works . 
  there 's a law that says how many times a bank is allowed to lend a sum of money . 
  and to answer your question . 
  the money comes from thin air basically ... then value of money is given by the fact that the bank guarantees for it . 
   your bank does n't keep your money in a vault until you want it back , it loans it out to other people and invests it . 
  it actually loans more that you give them . . about ten times more if i 'm not mistaking, 
  yeah . . maybe in some sort of camp ore something . . and we need an efficient transport system to take them there . . maybe trains & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  kick them where ? 
  not sure why you have -5 votes from me . . but here 's another one, 
  not at my school ... there were two guys who practiced rugby who used to bully people ( luckily not me ) . 
  now they 're both in the national rugby team . 
  except for the bullying and the puberty it 's nothing like the high school in america, 
  french sounds nice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zas9uxclofk, 
  i second that, 
  well ... fuck at least someone with good intentions made dose, 
  not everybody is bad http://imgur.com/a/q40yy#0, 
  and you know this because ... ? 
  yep . . that 's true ... but the others, 
  i feel sorry for muslim people across europe who do n't support this kind of extreme behavior and who will be most definitely victims of racism . 
  because you seem to know a lot about the issue, 
  agreed with you . 
  but the question was why is the dutch government the only one considering romania and bulgaria unfit . 
  yes ca n't argue with that . 
  but i was asking if you know a case when romania did n't comply with the rules set by the eu . 
  what you pointed out in that article is the internal corruption of romania witch i admit it 's a big problem , but it has ** nothing to do with joining the sechengen area ** . 
  when did we not play by the rules ? 
  please give me an example, 
  as someone pointed out in the comments . 
  corruption is not one of the criterias . 
  judging solely by the criterias of joining the schengen area , romania and bulgaria should be allowed . 
  laziness no [ link ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/08/europe-working-hours ) corruption ... yeah that probably had a role to . 
  but the biggest role played here where the banks and the fact that they are unregulated and they do what ever they want . 
  you still have n't answered my question . 
  do you have any idea about how economics work ? 
  if so , please explain how the southern states are responsible for this economic crisis and not the banks with their bad economical policies who stoped lending to businesses and started gambling on the financial markets . 
  i 'm genuinely interested, 
  it 's taboo because us tends to confuse socialism or even social democracy with the extreme version of it , witch is communism . 
  at least the republicans do, 
  care to share ? 
  he 's not as cool as obama, 
  because solar generated energy is still highly inefficient and very costly in comparison to wind generated energy . 
  energy balance : wind 6.6 months solar 3.2 years energy return on investment : - wind 36.5 to 1 - solar 5 to 1 currently the best achieved sunlight conversion rate ( solar panel efficiency ) is around 21 % in commercial products . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_panel ) [ source2 ] ( https://sites.google.com/site/anatomyofglobalclimatechangevj/data-and-analysis ), 
  1559mw = 1.59 gw yes they did, 
  actually in 2010 romania had 170 wind turbines installed ( 462mw ) . 
  in 2011 the output power went from 462mw to 982mw . 
  the next faze was 1559mw out of the total 14000mw potential . 
  the dobruja region , which consists of constan\u0163a and tulcea counties , has the second-highest wind potential in europe . 
  when completed , it will be the largest onshore wind farm in europe , surpassing the maranchon wind farm , the largest wind farm as of august 2009 .

  definitely ... but i would also put traian basescu, 
  that 's because they move to spain just for the climate ... every thing else is not as good, 
   `` i 'd want to kill myself if i was romanian too . '',

  maj\u0103 is from hungarian ? 
  did n't know that . . what about `` dic\u0103 '' = 25kg i believe , is that from austro-hungaria ? ... i heard my grandparents use it also in transilvania,
