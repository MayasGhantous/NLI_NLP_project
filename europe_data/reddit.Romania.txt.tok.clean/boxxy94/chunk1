this article smells like bullshit . 
  in romania people and a little boy died because they were bitten by stray dogs . 
  and the government took the right choice , to put them down , so the streets will be a safer place for the kids and the citizens of romania . 
  and now a bunch of loony dog lovers have gone mad ...

  that smile at 0:30 was a little laugh at upc 's 200 mbps internet that was marketed as `` the fastest internet in romania '' . 
  yes , the upload is only 100 mbps , but if you are downloading a torrent with enough seeders , that wo n't be a problem . 
  or if the server you are downloading from has 1 gbps upload . 
  for transfering big files without having to wait long times . 
  for example movies , music , documents , photos and acrhives . 
  also nowdays we use more devices that are connected to the internet , not just one pc per home . 
  yes , here we got 1 gbps for 13 $ / month ( 11 if you also get tv from digi ) . 
  all hail teszari !, 
  those are exagerated specs by rds . 
  you only need a good hdd and an i3 processor . 
  those 9 cities alone account for ~ 20 % of romania 's population . 
  source ? 
  it 's easy for those who live in a gypsy-free neighborhood to call racist people who criticize the gypsy way of living . 
  just like child-free people criticize so easily parents that scream at their kids .

  nice conspiration theory you got there , m8 .

  honestly : did you get receipts for the stuff you bought at that shop near you ? 
  i think not , so they deserve it . 
  do n't belive every fairy tale on the internet . 
  and most of the `` news '' about this have been actually only stories told from the perspective those pissed off people . 
  i rearly get receipts from those small shops , so i 'm glad someone is doing something about them .

  he and norbis did censor this sub . 
  a few of my posts were deleted and i 've seen others disapear . 
  i 've posted some complaints on / r/europemeta, 
   does not get enough children why do you think germany needs more children ? 
  take into account the technological evolution . 
  in 30 years there would be less jobs available than they were 30 years ago . 
   exact sentiment decades ago with guest workers and refugees from eastern europe this time is a different story . 
  middle east ! = east europe, 
   struggle to even achieve 3 % now . 
  but in 10 years if this `` let everyone from middle east come to europe and live on welfare '' program will continue , who knows . 
  i bet this will be deleted by dclauzel because it 's not in line with his bullshit pc agenda . 
  pretty much , yhea . 
  go fu * k yourself , mama merkel . 
  how about next time before you make a big invitation for muslims in middle east you take into acount the opinion of other eu countries . 
  [ video and pictures ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/extern/exodul/video+primele+corturi+pentru+refugiati+din+romania ), 
  like germany has hundred of thousands of availbe jobs to offer ... 
  the majority of them will live on welfare . 
  do n't forget that technology evolves , in 30 years there would be way less low qualified jobs than they were 30 years ago . 
  can you repost this with the original title translated into english ? 
  it depends on how bad the economic imigrants from middle east will distroy the western countries . 
  why ? 
  because you 're fat and loud ? 
  why do you always have to write in french ? 
  ca n't you just write in english ? 
  and some people still think they are only refuges and germeny is the only safe contry ... 
  youforgot the link , m8, 
  / r/europe 466,624 subs / r/europe < 100 subs that 's why . 
  people need to see this . 
  freedom of speach is very important . 
  that 's right . 
  why complain on the main sub so other 466,621 subscribers can see this , better post in a < 100 sub where mods made multiple accounts to give you the impresion that someone is listening to your complain about moderators . 
  so minority people are some special kind of people of which we can only say good things about ? 
  ok ... so ... muslims ... are stunning and brave !, 
  ca n't other moderatords or admins do something about it ? 
  it 's not ok to censor an article just because you do n't like it . 
  where 's the freedom of speach ? 
  it 's only for ** registred ** migrants in ** turkey **,

  you can . 
  they kept the 100 mbps option for parts where they do n't have the infrastructure to give more . 
   sexism is motivated either by misogyny or ~ ~ extreme ~ ~ utilitarianism or by humor  utilitarianism oh look , a fancy word . 
   utilitarianism = the belief that the value of a thing or an action is determined by its utility . 
  so , what are you saying ? 
  men should n't get paid more just because they are more useful for a company ? 
  misoginism implies hateful feelings towards women . 
  things like `` women do n't deserve equal pay because they work softer/less than men '' or `` women should not wear pants '' are just sexism , because one does not have to have hateful feelings towards women to say those things . 
  being a mysoginist is a different thing from being a sexist .
