  when your country looks like a fat fish from a cartoon , it 's not that hard . 
  a product of patriarchal subjugation . 
  if i put a chain on a gipsy , would that be acceptable as a product of culture ? 
  even though my ethnicity is romanian 100 % , i 'm more proud about being a transilvanian than a romanian . 
  i do n't know what 's your problem . 
   in many situations do they also ** scream ** allahu akbar when they 're in a place packed with non-muslims ( in europe or usa ) ? 
  ok , so i forgot about the arabic christians , maybe . 
  still . 
  they do n't ** scream ** allahu akbar when they 're in a place packed with non-muslims ( in europe or usa ), 
  when do christians say `` allahu akbar '' ( in exact this words ) except when they 're quoting or making fun of muslims ? 
  i do n't know why you replied to my comment if you did n't answer my question . 
  yes , christians say `` jesus is great '' but they do n't say it before they blow themself up . 
  some on broutght up `` deus vult '' but that 's different . 
  that phrase ** was ** used in the crusades , which were a direct attack by an army , not an terorist attack on citizens . 
  does the `` normal '' muslim also ** scream ** allahu akbar when visiting a place packed with non-muslims ? 
  that man is a genius !, 
  and how frequently did this happend in the last 20 years ? 
  x located in the west of europe  \u2713 secular not so sure about this, 
  do christians scream `` jesus is great '' befor they blow themself up ? 
  nope ... they do n't do that shit , so it 's different . 
  no , it 's not, 
   now i think that a true liberal would always prioritize individuals over the group , would always prioritize heresy over orthodoxy , will always prioritize the dissenting voice over the status quo . 
  that 's what a true liberal should be looking for . 
  within the muslim minority context that means finding those voices while critical of their own culture and i find liberals a very good when it comes to criticizing mainstream society being introspective about our own foreign policy mistakes and rightly so . 
  yet there is n't that expectation that a muslim can in turn be introspective about their own muslim community into which they were born . 
  when people protest for the sake of protesting and ask different things in the same ... region of protest , it 's a circlejerk . 
  people feel like all the politicians that they heard about before are corrupt and want to see new faces , in the hope they would be less corrupt . 
  some want romania to become a monarchy . 
  that 's why i see those demonstrations as a criclejerk .

  why romania and not dacia 2 . 
  why romania 3 . 
  why romania 's name is romania 4 . 
  why is romaia different, 
  hey , do n't be vampirophobe . 
  random question : do you think this is worse than `` honour killing '' cases that happen in western europe ? 
  there 's also a myth that if you cut/crop a dog 's tail it will make him tougher . 
  maybe that 's the reason why they did this . 
  well , kinda https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/docking_ ( animal ), 
  nope . 
  that 's the gipsy way of life . 
  show of your wealth as much as possilbe . 
  they do n't care about education or other basic stuff . 
  and they also get big bucks when they sell their daughters in arranged marriages . 
  i do n't think this is true . 
  i 've seen an article about romanian gipsies who go to sweeden to beg , they said that the sweeds give them 10 euro and in romania they only get 25 cents . 
  their reaction when they saw the gypsies ' palaces in arges, 
   we still lag behind on bureaucracy , corruption , infrastructure , hospitals and schools . 
  but when it comes to churches , we 're on top !, 
  and even if they are syrians , it dose n't mean the come directly from syria . 
  many are from turkey refugee camps . 
  they are alot of them who come from turkey , jordan refugee camps . 
  they now most of them ar economic migrants but are affraid to publicly call them that . 
  the limit should be higher . 
  on bigoted post , not those that provide a different perspective and spark a civil debate with arguments , as this one is . 
  syrian refugees is now a topic of high interest for many europeans in this subreddit . 
  europe is dealing with this and i do n't know what 's wrong about a article that shows how other countries are dealing with it . 
  as you can see there are almost 100 comments on this , so i do n't think this should be deleted . 
   we invented new jobs . 
  highly skilled new jobs . 
  why ? 
  because they care more about their own citizens ? 
  in europe contries it seems it 's the other way around ... economic migrants from middle east  our own poor citizens, 
   pointless no it 's not . 
  a rectangular has a lot of points . 
  i 've got a few submissions deleted from here by the moderators . 
  6 months ago / r/europe was pro migrants and anti anti-imigrationist from middle east, 
  behind harvard 's business review paywall : how long can this go on ? 
  according to a recent article in the wall street journal , the 17-nation euro zone remains the `` weakest link '' in our global economy after years of economic stagnation , mired in high unemployment , plagued with stalled or contracting economies , and paralyzed by political dysfunction . 
  similarly , the economist also lambasts eerily complacent eu leaders for `` sleepwalking through an economic wasteland . '' the resulting human suffering is sobering -- tens of millions of europeans who want work ca n't find it , and many of them are facing truly desperate situations . 
  here are just a few observations , which i address not to eu officials -- whose performance , to my mind , justifies their removal ( see below ) -- but rather , as a friend speaking to ordinary europeans who are suffering under their policies and who , unfortunately , have not been accorded the power to do anything about it . 
  in a phrase , it 's time to throw out the eu project itself . 
  the whole thing , root and branch . 
  here are just a few reasons why . 
  the eu has failed the most important test . 
  for more than three years now , eu officials have addressed the economic downturn with remarkable single-mindedness . 
  they 've imposed severe austerity ( reducing government debts through drastic cuts in spending along with tax increases ) -- particularly in those countries with the largest debts , the so-called `` periphery . '' how well is it working ? 
  let 's use ronald reagan 's test for jimmy carter : are people better off now than they were four years ago ? 
  the region has just completed its six straight quarter of recession . 
  overall unemployment has risen steadily for two years , now topping 12 percent . 
  in several countries , unemployment rates are at great depression levels -- 17 percent in portugal , 27 percent in spain -- and youth unemployment is typically around twice that of the country averages . 
  it 's clear that people in spain , ireland , italy , portugal , greece and millions of unemployed elsewhere in the region are worse off today than they were four years ago . 
  a growing number of officials around the world are getting this . 
  in his recent new york review of books article , nobel prize winning economist paul krugman points to an october report from the international monetary fund ( imf ) that basically apologizes for its austerity recommendations in the last few years -- backed up with evidence . 
  the report shows that those countries forced into austerity measures by the eu experienced steep downturns in their economies , contrary to predictions . 
  further , the more drastic the austerity ( measured by calculating spending cuts and tax increases as a percentage of gdp ) , the greater the economic downturn . 
  yet eu officials -- apparently convinced of the infallibility of their theory on how economies work -- seem unmoved by such evidence and the human suffering that goes along with it . 
  as mr. krugman put it , in the eu `` the beatings will continue until morale improves . '' which brings me to the next point . 
  the eu system is undemocratic . 
  consider portugal . 
  with unemployment rates at dangerous levels , and its economy predicted to contract by 2.3 % this year -- its third straight year of contraction under austerity policies -- the nation 's constitutional court struck down several austerity measures enacted by the government in compliance with european commission requirements . 
  that prompted commission officials to pressure the country 's government to simply ignore the ruling , under threat of losing badly needed funding -- prompting a constitutional crisis . 
  in such ways , eu officials are inserting themselves into the governance of member nations . 
  yet the ordinary people whose lives are seriously affected by such measures have no recourse -- they ca n't vote to `` throw the bums out '' as we might say here in the states . 
  this lack of democratic accountability poses a serious problem for member states and the system as whole . 
  it 's time to revisit the eu 's founding purposes . 
  the lofty purposes the eu originally set for itself included : to give europeans the convenience of one currency , to enhance mutual prosperity , and to reduce political tensions after centuries of animosity and war . 
  we 've seen how mutual prosperity is coming along . 
  as for political tensions , a system whose officials are responsible for the region 's faltering economies but who are not accountable to the tens of millions of unemployed people in them , is obviously exacerbating those tensions rather than alleviating them . 
  moreover , by giving up their national currencies , member countries who experience wage inflation can no longer temporarily deflate their currencies to make their exports more attractive .
