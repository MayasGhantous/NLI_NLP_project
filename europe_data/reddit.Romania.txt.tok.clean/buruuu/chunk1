btw i knew the guy from / r/romania so i dont think he minds :d assuming he knows im joking, 
  i do n't think it 's a slave mentality , it 's pragmatic mentality . 
  not sure about translylvania , but some of the infrastructure in vojvodina was better developed in austrian times than now . 
  there are irrigation systems and channels that were used then , but are now in disrepair . 
  even some railroad tracks i believe .  same for transylvania, 
  romania has its own london i guess . 
  segregation is too far fetched of a term . 
  differences between regions are completely normal considering romania was basically formed by snapping two countries together , then adding another one half a century later . 
  with that said , i think our differences can be considered mild in comparison to what other european countries such as serbia and spain are experiencing . 
  edit : done, 
  hey they got us right for once, 
  how is it not about the money ? 
  he made a dumb point stating that kenya is in the top 30 therefore it 's not about the money . 
  yeah well how about the other 29 developed countries ? 
  or just let them wonder about in the summer . 
  i used to just sit around and play video games when it was too hot to go out , then spend the rest of the time playing football . 
  being little was easy . 
  most families that live in the city send their kids in the countryside at their grandparents ( given that a few decades back romania was n't hit by urbanization yet , so the grandparents still live in the countryside ) . 
  boy was that a blast :d, 
  i think it 's mainly us : c, 
  we are bloodthirsty, 
  itt : romanians trying to convince everyone we are not gypsies . 
  we are n't , i promise, 
  pretty sure they would also include timisoara or temeswar since the pretty much built the place, 
  hungarian pm actually said that he is considering fencing off the romanian border if this happens iirc, 
  this map is missing at least a couple place within 30 km of timisoara , ro . 
  we get norway 's oil reserves . 
  sweet !, 
  in romanian we have `` groaznic '' and it sortof means the same, 
  mostly yes , but nowadays blocks of flats do n't look so bad due to renovating projects undergo . 
  those are not that bad tbh , by communist standards those are quite modern and good looking . 
  you can not imagine how vast and ugly apartment buildings are here , [ especially in big cities ] ( http://www.drogaonline.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/apartment-blocks-in-romania.jpg ) . 
  and here i am at work having a giggle by myself . 
  ehem . . if not more * cough * piracy * cough cough *, 
  wtf, 
  country and continent *, 
  we did it !, 
  you are 100 % trolling, 
  i eat lunch everyday at a serbian restaurant soooo ... 
  that is exactly the case :p, 
  not poor fuck yea, 
  that 's odd . . 
  almost every person under 30 i meet is an atheist and makes sure everybody is aware of it . 
  1.3 % * baia mare was 2.5 %, 
  according to 2011 data , the gypsy situation looks a bit like this : timisoara - 2.1 k - 0.7 % of total pop . 
  bucharest - 24k - 2.5 % cluj - 3k - 1 % so you either have never been to timisoara and are just following the gypsy circle jerk or you are just ignorant . 
  we gave in to the shabbat powers, 
  you do n't get laid too often either :p, 
  as far as i know the parliament can only pass/reject laws , but i suck at these things . 
  so far the most likely reason would be bad weather actually, 
  this ca n't be right . 
  everyone knows we are 2m tall , 170 iq dacian descendants . 
  do n't tell him ... 
  [ it 's about time i bring this out again ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ct58s/average_internet_speed_in_eu_by_country/cjiyt5n/?context=3 ) also , when downloading from blizzard or steam you can easily get up to 100-120 mbps ( capital b , as in bytes ), 
  there is now way the percentage is this low . 
  i 've barely met anyone who did n't smoke . 
  oddly usual for us, 
  we have cevapcici in serbian restaurants in timisoara . 
  it 's like the love child of romanian mici and serbian pleskavica . 
  ^ excuse ^ spelling ^ pls ^ dont ^ kill ^ me, 
  yeah sorry i just misspelled it . 
  any story behind the name that you know of ? 
  romania plania ? 
  are you implying i 'm not ?? 
  it says right there his original name was draghici and that 's a romanian name for sure . 
  i mean who would lie on the internet ? 
  that 's nice but everybody knows he was romanian and his name was nicolae teslea it 's true !, 
  you can read it [ in this totally not obscure 100 % legitimate and non biased source ] ( http://www.istro-romanian.net/articles/art990111.html ), 
  f r u n c e r u n c e, 
  yes , the second ` i ' at the end is an article , as in : ' ** the ** mici ' . 
  actually we learn ` oda bucuriei ' in school . 
  the romanian lyrics are truly amazingly beautiful , as are the german ones . 
  i can still sing it by heart after more than 10 years since i learned it . 
  yes i suppose the things we have a history for are : * blood sucking vampires * gypsies * gifting flowers and balloons to riot police in that order, 
  [ we have a history of doing things like this ] ( http://www.foxcrawl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/romanian-gendarme-heart-balloon-gift.jpg ) edit : also [ this ] ( http://www.foxcrawl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/romanian-gendarme-and-heart.jpg ), 
  yea no shit lol, 
  right now people are marching escorted by the police to gather more people from throughout the city . 
  the pictures were taken ~ 7pm local time and depict roughly 15k people in the main square ( piata operei/victoriei ) . 
  an estimate for right now is well beyond that figure , as the formation stretches for well over 1.5 km . 
  update edit holy fuck this is insane . 
  people on 3km of two lane streets . 
  3-5k in timisoara and cluj also, 
  could n't help but read your comment in trump 's voice, 
  yes i know , something something dracula, 
  [ let us rejoice !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arzoir24omc ), 
  i have yet to see a map where the balkans are not all red and angry . 
  i would like to make a proposition : romania should swap places with spain for homogeneity 's sake . 
  * smiling out loud *, 
  we can into southern europe, 
  if i had a euro for every time this was posted :d, 
  see ? 
  we told you all !, 
  yea it 's like a lot of people but you get used to it, 
  it 's trillions my dude , trillions, 
  that 's a relief , everyone knows we get like 2 trillion tourists per capita anyways, 
  white = no tourists ** or ** white = no data ? 
  is there a picture where trudeau does n't look good ? 
   balkans triggered, 
  yea no,
