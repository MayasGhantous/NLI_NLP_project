  why do people hate pineapple pizza so much ? 
  i 've tried that stuff and it 's actually pretty good , very refreshing . 
  i feel more triggered by [ this ] ( http://archives.quarrygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/deep-dish-3.jpg ) kind of monstrosity and i 'm not even italian . 
  they 're not wrong though . 
  `` you look pretty white for a romanian ! '', 
  well technically your own government admitted that in 1995 . 
  you could say that about a lot of sports in romania . 
  football , tennis , handball , gymnastics etc. 
  it 's one of the few areas where the communist regime actually did better than what came after . 
  *** ~ futi , nu futi , vremea pulii trece . ~ *** ( whether you fuck or not , the time of the dick shall pass . ), 
  what, 
  as much as i despise abusive law enforcement , whenever i hear about stuff like this i just wish someone would go in and beat the living shit out of those rioters . 
  it 's absolutely pathetic that we got to a point where riots are almost regularly in the news , and because of almost any conceivable reason . 
  trump gets inaugurated ? 
  let 's vandalize storefronts in dc !, 
  government tries to decriminalize corruption ? 
  better throw rocks and ice at police that have nothing to do with it . 
  some guy allegedly commits police brutality ? 
  might as well set fire to cars on the streets and put a kid 's life in danger , that 'll show them !, 
  i 'm sure the police will be extra gentle next time thanks to these losers . 
  but kovesi is one of the `` liberal oppressors '' according to our current government . 
  i dunno about you , but i hear about the male or female gender all the time . 
  the list seems absurdly arbitrary iyam, 
  that was hardly `` the last time '' that happened . 
  try more like last week lol, 
  people thought china would collapse without democratic reforms , yet it 's now the world 's largest economy and it 's only getting more authoritarian . 
  okay , i get what most of those things are supposed to be , but `` gender-gifted '' ? 
  what do these even mean ? 
  edit : i also like how they somehow managed to include all these terms but forgot `` male '' and `` female . '', 
  really ? 
  did you ask every single one of them and came to that conclusion ? 
  i still do n't understand how some people think a place where the vast majority of people are non-muslim is a victim of `` islamization . '', 
  does pilat/pyla mean anything in particular , or is it just a name ? 
  my 8 years spent studying french tell me that `` dune du pyla '' means `` dune of pyla . '', 
  your point being ? 
  the people who elected the current government were also a minority . 
  iirc bessarabia was actually less developed than the rest of the country and might have actually dragged gdp/capita downward . 
  me too , my first thought was `` meh that 's probably some urban legend '' but it 's actually true, 
  you can sing the words to the eu anthem, 
  obviously not , but `` mersi '' is one syllable shorter than `` multumesc '' so whenever people can get away with saying it ( which is most of the time ) , they will . 
  after all , speed and efficiency are an integral part of our national character . 
  well of course you would n't say it in polite conversation , but you can definitely use it with people you do n't know . 
  saying `` multumesc '' at the wrong time can seem condescending . 
  romanian `` multumesc '' is semi-formal , most people just say `` mersi '' like in french . 
   futebolo i though calcium was the italian word for that, 
  some of them would . 
  the older generations are n't all as eurosceptic as some people make them out to be . 
  funny , we 've been through foreign occupation and yet we still want to federalize . 
  well yeah but it still means most people did n't vote for psd . 
  so their claim that they represent `` the people '' is bs . 
  lighten up , they 'll be in power for 4 years , not 5 . 
  also , the ~ 50 % they got in the election ( psd+alde ) is n't exactly what i 'd consider a `` wide margin . '', 
  it was more like 70k back then , this protest is way bigger than that one, 
  you do n't have to be right-wing to criticize immigration and islam though . 
  bill maher constantly does it and he 's as left-wing as they get . 
  it 's even got a [ name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) actually, 
  russian media spouts obvious lies and propaganda -  `` but western media does the same . '', 
  russia meddles in other countries ' internal affairs -  `` but western countries do the same . '', 
  russian military invades other countries -  `` but western military does the same . '', 
  russian government supports foreign dictatorships -  `` but western governments do the same . '', 
   `` we want to show that russian deputies will not allow the same excesses present in western europe , '' said ruling party politician andrei isayev . 
   he claimed that european children `` inform on their parents '' in order to get their way , which leads to the parents losing custody . 
  of * course * the top youtube comments bitch about there being a hijab-wearing woman in the video . 
  i do n't know why i expected anything else . 
  you 'd be surprised how many educated , urban romanians vote psd . 
  they call themselves social democrats , but ideologically they 're closer to ukip than labour . 
  i 'm more concerned with the ones that do n't get aborted . 
  i mean , teenage pregnancies ( [ which we have lots of ] ( http://www.factcheckni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/live-births-eu.png ) ) usually lead to poverty or child abandonment . 
  but fuck that , think of the children , ban sex ed !, 
  it 's not dying out , it 's becoming more efficient and automatized . 
  i think it 's got more to do with the fact that romania is still extremely rural compared to other european countries . 
  about 40-45 % of the population still lives outside of cities and towns , and most of those are small farmers so it figures the rate would be very high . 
  still , 28 % is depressing , and i 'm willing to bet much of that reduction came from emigration , not from economic development . 
  that does n't make a lot of sense in the context of trump 's rhetoric though . 
  `` make america great again ! '', 
  `` how ? '', 
  `` stop dominating the world ! '', 
  that 's one of the more unusual comments i 've read lately, 
  christ , at least they have an actual debate about the thing . 
  here the so-called leftist government just shrieked that sexual education `` corrupts the youth '' and that schools should teach abstinence instead . 
  i 'm not making this up . 
  keep in mind he was a pnl member for just a few months . 
  he had nothing to do with the psd-pnl alliance, 
  priest swag . 
  got ta impress the daddy upstairs if you wan na go to heaven . 
  some of those are actually russian but yes , pretty much relevant . 
  fine , so he talked about dreaming children who were made by the same creator . 
  my point stands . 
  btw , i listened to a dubbed speech so i basically had to listen to two people talking at the same time and make sense of what they 're saying . 
  i did n't try to `` twist '' anything . 
   and what i say is backed up by numbers so you 're from the future ? 
  can you give me stock market tips ? 
   unfortunately it seems i hurt your feelings . 
  i do n't care about them dense motherfuckers on the internet . 
  also , `` islam '' is a noun , not an adjective . 
  if you 're gon na play the grammar nazi at least do it right . 
  so you * are * one of them dense motherfuckers . 
  muh euro-superiority complex, 
  we have waaay too much religious bs in our politics as well so i do n't really find it that odd because i 'm used to it . 
  i think it 's mostly for political points though , many politicians pretend they are true believers but i doubt they actually are .
