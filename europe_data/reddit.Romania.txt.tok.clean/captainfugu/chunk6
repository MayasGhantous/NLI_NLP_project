  edit : scratch that , this is excessively religious . 
  he talked about children dreaming about the creator ffs, 
  well i do n't know about the others but in romania the social democrats called iohannis `` unfit '' to be president because he is childless and protestant . 
  which is hilariously hypocritical considering the only social democrat president we ever had was also childless , and atheist . 
  no , that 's just the french . 
  prostitutes exchange sex for money . 
  spies use sex as a weapon . 
  it 's completely different . 
  this might surprise you , but keeping people stupid and poor does n't win you many elections , and your insinuation that they actively seek to do that is contradicted by what happened when they actually were in power . 
  romania under nastase had one of the highest gdp growth rates in europe , for example . 
  ponta boasts that he was a good pm specifically because the economy recovered during his term while the previous pdl governments slashed salaries and imposed austerity . 
  saying that psd wants to keep you stupid and poor is n't all that different than saying pnl/usr want to sell out the country to soros . 
  neither are true . 
  oh please , this is one of the most offensive stereotypes i 've ever heard about romanian politics . 
  hurr durr psd wants you stupid and poor , because as we all know being stupid and poor automatically makes you a psd supporter . 
  think about what pnl and pmp and others do every election cycle and you 'll see that psd is n't at all the only party that exploits the lower classes for votes . 
  they 're just the most successful at it . 
  maybe he should legalize prostitution then . 
  offset the sanctions with sex tourism . 
  the romanian government wo n't do that because they know it would only rile up the pro-russians ( and russia ) even harder . 
  closing the border would seriously disrupt their ( already shitty ) economy and the moldovan socialists would accuse us of being fascist imperialists , as usual . 
  nothing would change . 
  i love it when butthurt nationalists who do n't know shit about history pretend romania is some sort of artificial nation as if romanian people do n't exist , lol . 
  wallachia , which you claim belongs to turkey , literally called itself the romanian land ( tara romaneasca ) in the middle ages fyi . 
  haha , yeah , no . 
  yeah , cause the elites brought in the cold wave , right ? 
  no , the weird part is if the bucharest-budapest route actually lasts only 14h and is on time . 
  had some business at the main station in budapest a few years ago , the only train that was delayed was the one from bucharest . 
  by about 4 hours , iirc . 
  `` holiday destination '' , because it 's a country with beaches lol, 
  sorry , did n't mean to confuse you, 
  he did n't have to , a hundred other people in this thread did it for him, 
  i 'm always fascinated by people openly and loudly complaining about censorship in the exact place that they claim is being censored, 
  i was trying to make a point about being realistic instead of naive or cynical , but whatever , it 's not like i 'm gon na change their mind or anything, 
  i does n't but then again i doubt syrian law states that if people cross the border illegally you can drop bombs on them . 
  i doubt any of the anti-refugee people forgot about the war , they just do n't think their countries should take them in . 
  like i said , there are better ways to help stop the violence and improve the refugees ' situation than this . 
  like funding camps in turkey and jordan , both of which have way more refugees than europe at the moment . 
   syrian government has every right to just drop one kab-500 on them and be done with it that would cause a diplomatic shitstorm though , assuming most of these people are german citizens, 
  advertising coca cola is a business strategy , it 's not even remotely comparable to a war where a bunch of factions with radically different worldviews are slaughtering each other by the thousands every month . 
  especially when said factions are all supported by major foreign powers and pretty much hate each other 's guts . 
  syria is such a major clusterfuck right now that i 'm afraid force is the only thing that is actually going to make a difference there . 
  i 'm not saying alboth and people like her are wrong in their views , i 'm just saying they 're naive and their effort will change nothing . 
  if you really want to make a difference , raise awareness about libya instead . 
  libya 's status as a failed state is the main reason migrants are still coming in droves to europe right now , risking their lives to get to countries that do n't really want them in the first place . 
  sadly `` raising awareness '' has become a hip but meaningless phrase today . 
  what awareness is there to raise , everyone knows there 's a war going on . 
  edit : a word, 
  for some reason , i could 've sworn it was a woman by the post photo, 
  right-wing does n't necessarily mean small government , if that 's what you mean . 
  lots of far right parties in europe support expanded welfare and interventionism . 
  afaik they tried to deport him to tunisia but tunisia denied he 's a citizen so they refused . 
  i did n't say it stopped , i meant it 's not as bad as it used to be . 
  well i 'd argue that poland and hungary were less corrupt in the first place . 
  as far as i see it , they 're moving in a bad direction while we are moving in a good direction . 
  but romania certainly would n't have had successful anticorruption policies if it were n't for sustained eu and us pressure . 
  i 'd say the eu is the main reason elites are n't robbing * my * country blind anymore . 
  but then again romania is much more susceptible to that kind of influence than russia, 
  care to elaborate on that ? 
  yeah , poor russia , bullied by the imf into a becoming a market economy . 
  it 's not as if they wanted the whole thing themselves to get rid of the gargantuan clusterfuck which was the soviet economy, 
  funny how economists seem to say the exact [ opposite ] ( http://http-server.carleton.ca/~vpopov/documents/tr-rec-full.pdf ) :  the crux of the debate - the speed of transition - turned out to be a secondary issue for performance , whereas the primary issue - the strength of institutions - was overlooked by both schools of thought . 
  in the end , it really boils down to the fact that russian elites robbed their country blind while conveniently blaming `` western interference '' . 
  the author did n't take this to its logical conclusion . 
  burka-banning nationalists will bring down the eu -  burkas will bring down the eu -  textiles will bring down the eu if you wear clothes , you are anti-european . 
  it already is operational . 
  since [ 2009 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_geostationary_navigation_overlay_service ) . 
  i distinctly recall the same thing being said during the financial crisis yet it 's still here, 
  are romanian nhs doctors experimenting on your child ? 
   keeping in mind that romania was a shithole compared to serbia now when it joined eu if we were such a shithole would you kindly explain how is it that we joined ten years ago while you guys are still 32 out of 34 chapters away from joining ? 
  that is , until all the european muslims get pissed that you just nuked mecca and become radicalized by themselves . 
  glad to help :'), 
  long story short , the president is head of state ( the entire country ) , pm is head of government ( i.e. 
  the cabinet of ministers ) . 
  they 're both executive offices , but the pm answers to parliament whereas the president answers strictly to the constitution , so to speak . 
  it 's much like the french or russian systems , where the president actually has power and is more than just a figurehead . 
  edit : ** article 80 ** ( 1 ) the president of romania shall represent the romanian state and is the safeguard of the national independence , unity and territorial integrity of the country . 
  ( 2 ) the president of romania shall guard the observance of the constitution and the proper functioning of the public authorities . 
  to this effect , he shall act as a mediator between the powers in the state , as well as between the state and society . 
  ** article 107 ** ( 1 ) the prime minister shall direct government actions and co-ordinate activities of its members , with the observance of the powers and duties incumbent on them . 
  likewise , he shall submit to the chamber of deputies or the senate reports and statements on government policy , to be debated with priority . 
  he 's not getting replaced . 
  dacian ciolos , the pm , is . 
  that 's not 2016-y , that 's voter fatigue . 
  turnout has been declining for decades because in every , and i mean every election , there were people who claimed they stood for a clean political class and then disappointed people . 
  it happened in ' 96 , it happened in ' 04 , it happened again in '08 and in ' 14 , and you can be sure that it 'll happen again . 
  and when it comes to a `` decent party '' , which party is that ? 
  because if you 're thinking of usr , they actually did very well , coming in third place considering they 're a bunch of outsiders who did n't even exist until a few months ago . 
  and if you were thinking of pnl , believe me , they are definitely not a decent party . 
  there are people within who are trying to pull it in the right direction , but the party as a whole is crippled by internal power struggles and lack of vision . 
  it 's gon na be years until all their talk about reform will actually materialize and until then they 'll keep losing elections . 
  it 's not over , the psd were in government in 2012-2015 too and they still were n't able to stop the anti-corruption drive . 
  the previous government were independent technocrats who came to power a year ago after the previous psd government fell . 
  the anti-corruption stuff is done by the dna and it 's unlikely to end considering that this election does n't really change anything for them . 
  i hate to break the circlejerk but this election was ** not ** `` 2016-y '' at all . 
  psd 's victory is neither a surprise nor is it going to be the end of the world . 
  in fact , i 'd say this election was an improvement over the [ last one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_legislative_election,_2012 ) . 
  i mean , psd has a smaller majority now than they did in 2012 , and in third place we have a genuinely reformist party instead of a ridiculous tv star businessman who ran on empty populist rhetoric ( sound familiar ? ) . 
  we also have a president that is in league with the opposition and a justice system which is n't going to suddenly stop doing their jobs just because ... the same party that was in power in 2012-2015 is in power again ? 
  give me a break .
