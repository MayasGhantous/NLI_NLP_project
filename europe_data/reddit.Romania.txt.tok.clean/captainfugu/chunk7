  that 's not how the economy works,

  pretty much the only major news channel that is n't pushing party agendas or sensationalist b.s. 
  down your throat . 
  they can differ greatly from country to country , depending on their legal traditions . 
  romania for example first adopted a french-inspired civil code in 1864 and used it all the way up until 2011 , by which time it had undergone so many revisions and modifications that in some ways it was unrecognizable from the original . 
  then an entirely new code came into force in 2011 , which maintained many former provisions , but also introduced new stuff like trust laws which , iirc , were inspired by the civil code of quebec . 
  ironically laws being arbitrarily designed by technocrats is exactly what you get by allowing the judiciary to create laws . 
  the legislative should normally be the sole creators of law , because they are the ones elected by the people as their representatives . 
  this is why some jurists believe that common law systems are incompatible with the separation of powers . 
  i said 15 years ago , not 50 . 
  france had [ two deaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_france ) from terrorist attacks in the 2000s , none of which was connected to islamic extremism . 
  fast forward to today , they had hundreds of deaths in less than a year , are in the longest state of emergency they 've ever been in and face the very real possibility of a far-right president . 
  never say never . 
  that does n't make them immune to radicalization . 
  france did n't have islamic terrorism 15 years ago either , and look at them today . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  it 's basically religious fundamentalism and it promotes social isolation . 
  salafism and wahabbism are one of the main reasons so many muslims are poorly integrated in european countries . 
  it 's not illegal per se , but it 's definitely a bad influence . 
  i 'm 300km north of it and the sun is shining here too . 
  i hope it stays that way . 
  hear that bulgaria ? 
  do n't send that snow here or we gon na get nasty, 
  i am genuinely curious how did people start eating something so foul-smelling in the first place . 
  i imagine it was something like a bunch of swedes fishing in the baltic and one of them said `` hay guys what if instead \u00d6f eating the herring n\u00d6w we let it ferment f\u00d6r a year first '' and the others were like `` great idea sven see y\u00d6u in a year '' and then they come back after a year and open the can and it smells so bad that they all proceed to vomit their guts out and they 're like `` aaaawwww sheeeit '' and then sven is like `` hay maybe it tastes better than it smells th\u00d6 '' and they proceed to eat it and they continue to vomit their souls out and go like `` phraaaarrgghhhh sheeeeiiit '' and then sven is like `` hay maybe if we put it \u00d6n s\u00d6me bread it will be \u00d6k th\u00d6 '' and they were all like '' \u00d6kay this is what we eat hundreds \u00d6f years fr\u00d6m n\u00d6w \u00d6n g\u00d6\u00d6d j\u00d6b sven '' edit : your serious explanations mean nothing to me . 
  i want to believe . 
  that 's pretty much what we do here , everybody starts studying english in 2nd grade and then french/german/etc . 
  in 5th grade . 
  though mostly french . 
  oh please . 
  i keep hearing this benefits nonsense over and over again yet i 've never seen a single actual source supporting it . 
  over two-thirds of romanians and bulgarians arriving in 2015 [ already had a job waiting for them ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/brexit-fears-haunt-bulgarian-and-romanian-emigrants-03-14-2016 ) when they got to the uk . 
  yet the british media , which never misses a chance to shit on our image , paints us as some sort of lazy benefit-leechers who ca n't wait to overrun the uk . 
  170,000 romanians out of 65 million people , good god , make sure they do n't sink the fucking island in the ocean with those mind-boggling numbers . 
  there 's at most 4 million turks in germany , not that much if you consider the polish and russian communities are even larger . 
  most of the [ foreign-born population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany ) in germany is european in origin . 
  why ? 
  the eu is a political union with a single market , the rest of the world is n't . 
  the `` rromani '' name is of sanskrit origin , it has fuck-all to do with the british . 
   i 'm happy to hear that in romania roma people are well integrated . 
  that 's a huge overstatement . 
  they might be better integrated than in other countries , but there 's still big differences between them and the general population . 
  i 'd say most people who left romania for western europe were unemployed here , regardless of ethnicity . 
  street cleaners , yeah , but construction workers seem mostly romanian to me . 
  i 've noticed a lot of lower class romanians engaged in physical labor tend to have darker skin due to exposure , especially in the countryside . 
   in bucharest , on construction sites , i see that most of the workers are roma . 
  some people would argue that 's why construction projects are always behind schedule lol . 
  but joking aside , how do you know they 're roma ? 
  thankfully , when i was a kid cartoon network was n't dubbed yet . 
  surprised to see how well we are doing compared to other countries , given how much shit we get about our treatment of gypsies, 
  does anyone actually use `` puicu\u021b\u0103 '' in that sense though ? 
  i do n't recall hearing or seeing that word except in tv subtitles , which are notoriously inaccurate anyway . 
  wow , entitled much ? 
  you basically get the same rights as we do , i do n't recall us being under any obligation to give minorities special privileges . 
  also , i 'm curious how * your * government would treat us if the roles were reversed , given their track record so far . 
  `` their autonomous rights '' is more nationalist bullshit that would only affect about a third of hungarians living here . 
  they have equal rights , they can use their own language , they have their own party ( which is almost perpetually in government coalitions ) , what more could they possibly want ? 
  * fathers . 
  we had [ two ] ( http://www.mixdecultura.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/decebal-regele-dacilor.jpg ) [ fathers ] ( http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/trajan.jpg ) before it was cool . 
  yeah , according to hungarian nationalists who are still butthurt over something that happened 100 years ago . 
  if you visit transylvania you 'll find romanians and hungarians actually get along quite nicely . 
  omg when did that sub start existing ? 
  well what the fuck could you expect from a guy who calls himself `` mr. flirt '', 
   no , it 's to prevent a single person from doing that , the state as a whole still holds all the power and can do it . . no , it 's to prevent one branch ( i.e. , the executive in this case ) from gaining control of the state and imposing its will unchecked . 
   you realize that people are allowed to defend themselves in pretty much every western country ? 
  yes . 
  it 's called self-defense , and it 's pretty much an exception that confirms the rule : you are allowed to exercise violence to protect yourself because the state is n't there to do it for you . 
   if the gov has the monopoly of force then it can ignore any checks and balances and the people are unable to do anything against it . 
  well there 's our disagreement . 
  the government is not supposed to be able to do that despite it having a monopoly on force . 
  things like the separation of powers are specifically designed to prevent the government ( i.e. 
  the state ) from operating monolithically ; instead it forces each branch of government to keep tabs on the others and vice versa so as to prevent a dictatorship from establishing itself . 
  seriously , ask any legal expert , the concept of a state not having a monopoly on ( legitimate ) force is absurd . 
  i 'd argue that a government without monopoly of force is by definition a failed state . 
  because if the people can legitimately use force , then you get mob rule , vigilante justice , and ultimately anarchy . 
  anyone could potentially oppose violations of what they perceive as their `` rights '' through violent means . 
  and on the other hand , a government with proper checks and balances would n't be able to do any of the things you said . 
  the government is n't some monolithic entity that is out to get you at every opportunity , despite what some people think . 
   no , it absolutely should not , else it 's a totalitarian regime , the people need to have the ability to stand up to and challenge the government . 
  there 's these things called `` elections '' that are specifically designed for that . 
  i think if anything it goes to show how clueless these people are about relationships in europe . 
  then again i 'm sure the alt-right folks will have a meltdown over this lol, 
  seeing them all makes me very uncomfortable for some reason . 
  i 'm sure berliners would beg to differ, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhumajphbde ), 
  personally , i ca n't help but get some guilty pleasure out of this . 
  i never , ever thought i 'd say that america would be better off with our president instead of vice versa . 
  but now i do . 
  as if that does n't happen in romania , too . 
  also , [ agerpres ] ( http://www.agerpres.ro/english ), 
  but is n't that a very simplistic way of looking at it ? 
  i mean , people who make more money also tend to have bigger expenses , because they can afford to buy more stuff , so they do n't necessarily pay less vat proportionally . 
  also , some countries have special reduced vat rates for certain products ( i know romania for example has a 20 % vat in general , but only 9 % for food and drinks , specifically to help out low income earners ) , and progressive income taxation can help offset some of the potential discrepancies anyway . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  harassing women is taken way more seriously in europe than in the middle east . 
  hell , there were cases in the uae where rape victims were prosecuted for adultery while the rapists walked . 
  edit : a word, 
  because supposedly vat affects poor people more than the middle or upper classes . 
  i do n't personally believe that , but that 's the argument,
