  i get what you are saying from the point that hungary might do something by claiming it has a lot of citizens concentrated in a specific country . 
  on the other hand i think your leaning a bit towards paranoia , but better to be safe then sorry , right ? 
  from what i 'm gathering , the game at the moment is about boosting support for the party through good will by getting new voters . 
  i would expect the eu , un or nato ( or some other acronym ) to put hungary in it 's place if it would reach a point where it would be a threat to romania . 
  i mean please , yurop fuck yeah . 
  we should stick together and not fight each other . 
  ( that 's why i 'm on this sub ) however , i do happen to have a few a points where i do n't really agree with you . 
   but there 's a problem here when you award citizenship ... all in countries around your borders , all in countries on which hungary has/have issued territorial claims in the past , in countries which gained , at the loss of hungary , territories after ww2 . 
  it is available for everyone world wide , plus those territories were for a long time a part of hungary , it 's thus not so surprising that they might have a high concentration of hungarians . 
   plus , all these countries would very much want to integrate and homogenize their population , not separate them into different ethnic groups further and secluding one from the other even more . 
  if you ask me hungarians are integrated within romanian society , except for those maybe who are too stupid to learn romanian . 
  also preserving national identity should be important . 
  it does not have to be necessarily moronic and xenophobic as it is currently expressed by the most vocal members from both sides . 
  culture is awesome . 
  you are asking of me to forget about guly\u00e1s and about it being hungarian , but would you considering forgetting about ciorb\u0103 and about it being romanian if you were to live in hungary or any other country ? 
  ( plus all the other things we have through which we form our national identities , like arts )  tl ; dr - hungary awarding citizenship to people who speak hungarian across countries is a dick move and only hinders the process of integration that those countries are investing in . 
  at this point i might say you are straying towards ethnic cleansing , i mean come on , you can integrate into society by having a different ethnicity and that should be enough , integrating into an ethnicity is basically assimilation . 
  give it time , it will happen , unless your fears come true and there will be a hungarian revolution , hungary declares war and greater hungary is re-established . 
  either that , or magically all hungarian families will have way more children than romanian families . 
  which was a dick move by the slovaks imo . 
  most if not all those people lived there their entire lives , it is their home . 
  this crap that `` romania belongs to romanians , hungarians gtfo '' ( same for slovakia ) is stupid . 
  the place you were born is your home , it does n't matter what language you speak , whether 2000 years ago whose ancestors lived in the country 's current geographical location or how the borders were drawn . 
  being told by your own government that if you dare take pride in your national ( well ethnic ) identity you are no longer welcome in the country you were born in and consider your home , that 's just fucked up . 
  i 'm hungarian , but i 'd rather live in romania than in hungary specifically because an insignificant little town in romania is my home . 
  i hope this means that romania will finally get access to the playstation store and xbox live . 
  fuckin ' sony , i ca n't even reset my password or redeem my freaking online passes without having to use a fake account . 
  ( also online passes suck ), 
  i 'm happy we are even on the list . 
  romania represent !, 
  would someone please tell if this means that we can import , i.e. 
  buy stuff online , without having to pay import tax and vat ? 
  thank you, 
  so to answer your questions yes it could be made more direct and representatives are necessary , you need someone to represent us in international affairs however they should ask us directly what we want instead of acting on their beliefs alone . 
  basically we employ them we are the boss and it should n't be the other way around . 
  as i said if the people would be up to date on the issues and would apply critical thinking a direct democracy could be possible . 
  currently direct democracy is impossible to achieve in romania . 
  in that case representative democracy works . 
  in fact i would say that if politicians would be honest a representative democracy would be good too however in the real world there is more at play when they make decision apart from what is best for the people . 
  it is a lot of ifs and i honestly ca n't say for sure whether one would work better than the other but i would certainly welcome it if there would be more voting involved on issues . 
  switzerland . 
  edit : direct democracy would be way better than representative democracy but doing this on an eu scale would be impossible ... probably . 
  maybe in the future we 'll have the infrastructure to handle voting , no electronic vote rigging and informed citizens who also vote ... and i just described a utopia . 
  we use democracy because we do n't have something else that is better in practise . 
  i mean communism is cool on paper and look how that turned out . 
  i think every person in europe should be taught english from kindergarten hopefully reaching an intermediate level , i.e. 
  cefr b1 or b2 , by the end of high school , although preferably it should be c1 . 
  you can keep your language , english would n't be official , but it would be damn nice if everybody knew it . 
  the law says that if an animal is n't adopted in two weeks it 'll be put down . 
  i think that 's pretty reasonable . 
  it 's also quite interesting that people are cool with the slaughtering of cattle , swine etc. , but if it 's a cat or a dog everybody loses their minds . 
  it 's like bloody stockholm syndrome , we know that stray dogs are roaming the street , they are trouble , yet instead of dealing with the problem we defend it . 
   animal rights groups like four paws are instead calling for a mass sterilization program . 
  this , they argue , would stop the animals from breeding and ** enable them to live out their lives on the street ** . 
  that 's the bloody problem in the first place . 
  just because they ca n't have pups does n't mean they wo n't bite . 
  idiots . 
  it would also mean you have to keep up with the dogs constantly because you have to know when a new one arrives that has n't been sterilised yet and even if somehow magically every dog could be sterilised , it would take at least 10 years for all of them to die naturally . 
  that 's way too long a time for them to roam the streets and chase after people . 
  edit : the commenter in the article got it right :  killing all of those wild dogs will be very sad . 
  but the death of children is a tragedy . 
  i love animals too , but ** public safety trumps the rights of wild dogs ** . 
  everything depends on your financial situation imo . 
  if you have a lot of money and can afford luxuries it does n't really matter , but if you end up being on the low end of the income scale , it would be preferable to live in a developed country . 
  edit : if i would really have to choose . 
  switzerland . 
  i think it 's the best country in the world . 
  if anyone who can speak hungarian is interested , here are the two letters we received a few weeks ago . 
  i blurred my personal info and a qr code which had the same info , i did n't think it was necessary to blur the name and signature of public figures ( especially if they sent it out willingly to thousands of people ) . 
  http://imgur.com/a/j7vgo apart from these , we got a 2 page registration form and a 2 page manual on how to fill it out and send it . 
  i personally did n't bother and do not plan to go voting as i 'm more concerned about politics in romania than in hungary . 
  i personally hate these . 
  one half insults them , one half tells them how poor we are compared to them and that kate one is stupid because whenever women and countries come up , the country that is the subject of the conversation always has the most beautiful women in the world ( cough hungary cough , \u00e9s meg ne pr\u00f3b\u00e1ljon egy magyar se leszavazni ez\u00e9rt mert tudj\u00e1tok , hogy \u00edgy van ), 
  they also pay if they get an sms . 
  basically they had roaming from the start . 
  they are getting ripped off really bad on mobile plans or internet fees ( + datacaps and not so good speeds ) . 
  i think what the government is doing is wrong and what we all feared would happen is already happening . 
  with our every move being monitored on the internet , our internet being censored , the next step will be to chip away our right to privacy little by little . 
  i really do n't like where things are going and i hope just because the uk thinks it 's okay to do that filter , other countries in eu wo n't follow . 
  having the whole prism problem is bad enough , but i 'm not giving up hope on its resolution yet , however this looks like a loss for us and +1 for them , not to mention i 'd rather not have them start blocking vpns in any circumstance and doing it under the guise of a `` let 's save the children '' filter is underhanded . 
  i hate it when politicians pull one of these dirty cards to push through legislation that does n't really benefit , or at times makes it even worse for us regarding our rights for privacy and an uncensored internet . 
  your phone is a smart phone . 
  the current `` smart phone '' trend brought upon us was built on a set of features introduced in the symbian era by manufacturers ( i.e. 
  nokia , samsung and sony ericsson for the most part ) with shiny ui and touch screens added on top of them for a better user experience . 
  depending on what nokia you had , it could do more than the first iphone . 
  they only lacked the visuals and the simplicity that that ios ui offered . 
  i know , good thing too , the only reason i went with android is because the difference between the htc one and lumia 925 was 20 euros more for the htc after carrier subsidy ( would 've bought the same contract with or without a phone so it was worth buying a new phone ) and since specs wise it was better i 've gone with the android this time . 
  lg also has the double tap/lockscreen clock in their upcoming flagship android . 
  i just wish other companies , or even google as the os maker , would add it retroactively to older devices . 
  i do n't really have loyalties and the missing features were not enough to convince me to stay with nokia . 
  i actually just bought a htc one this weekend switching from the n9 ( we got a good deal from my operator could n't pass ) . 
  that blinkfeed the htc has was a nice touch imo , it 's a copy of one of the n9 's screens ( except you ca n't use custom rss feeds ) , too bad the whole android community hates it and i hope htc wo n't remove it because of that . 
  [ check this , the 3 screens the n9 has ] ( http://cdn.cnet.com.au/story_media/339317067/nokia-n9-ho_2.jpg ) ( note the left screen ) and here 's [ blinkfeed ] ( http://www.wikinoticia.com/images2//s3.celularis.com/files/2013/02/htc-blinkfeed-800x533.jpg ) ( you even have to swipe to the left just like the n9 , really nice ) there are only really 5 things that i miss from the n9 , [ the always on clock ] ( http://wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/white-nokia-n9-cell-phone-1.jpg ) , [ the alarm clock ui ] ( http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nokia_n9_hands-on_sg_20.jpg ) , double tap to wake , nokia maps/drive and life time call duration counting ( it resets each month on the htc ) . 
  one thing that annoys me , but something i can live with , is that you ca n't close all open applications at once , the n9 could . 
  the n9 was one of the best devices i ever had , i bought it specifically just to give it a try because it was one of a kind . 
  there would be no other iteration of it and i was curious , you could have bought any other os whenever you would want . 
  til rammstein did a song on the spill . 
  i actually have the album but did n't know that the song was about this spill . 
  sure if anyone wants to do it they should . 
  i was just proposing the mods because i assume that they would be more invested in the community than some of us if they have accepted to moderate it .
