  ordering from the us is n't that complicated , but above a sum you 'll have to pay vat and a customs tax . 
  for romania you have to pay if the declared value of the package is above 100 euros . 
  you should check out the website of your local authorities on how to handle packages outside the eu . 
  you have to go to the customs office with a print of the receipt and they can confiscate the stuff if it would be illegal . 
  ( while being legal in usa for instance ) . 
  true , i stand corrected . 
  i 'm not mad . 
  that 's a 100 megabit connection i.e. 
  less than 10 megabytes . 
  it 's great to have that speed but i have the same , and your upload is waaaay to slow compared to the download . 
  i 'll bet you wo n't get that speed for a lot of servers outside of portugal though . 
  how the hell were there so many happening in slovenia in 1965 ? 
  it 's actually that . 
  although i have never in my life tried adding water to that powder and i do n't think i 'll ever try . 
  but as an ingredient for home made chocolate , it 's fantastic . 
  this is how it looks [ like ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dpys8an_9z4/tllvrgpj4vi/aaaaaaaaa7w/rva-wx0mliy/s1600/hazicsoki3.jpg ) . 
  hehe , photism does have a point . 
  my grandma gets these as well . 
  although i have no idea why ( never really bothered to ask ) . 
  i always assumed it was meant for the poor and the disabled ( she 's almost completely blind ) . 
  after reading [ berxwedan ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1aatem/you_know_things_must_be_a_bit_desperate_in/c8vnesn ) 's comment , i can totally believe that it is a possibility that there is simply a surplus that needs to disappear , because we have no need for the stuff since we are pretty well off . 
  ( but since it 's free , we still go to pick it up , grandma makes the best chocolate in the world from that milk powder ) . 
  we do n't get cheese , but we do get rice , cornmeal , macaroni , milk powder , biscuits , canned peas/tomatoes , sunflower oil , sugar , flour and probably something else i ca n't remember . 
  edit : made things more coherent, 
  except heroin is illegal . 
  one bad example after the other . 
  you propose heroin , posnania proposes chemical weapons . 
  they fall exactly into the same category as tobacco . 
  so what ? 
  tobacco can be exported . 
  if it can generate more money , we should produce it . 
  it kinda makes us hypocrites , but it kinda does n't at the same time . 
  i do n't smoke cigarettes and hate it that every pub/restraurant etc. 
  here is filled to the brim with cigarette smoke , so i like it that the eu is trying to save me from cancer , but if i could make money by growing tobacco , i 'll do it and let the smokers worry about their own health . 
  i suppose the eu could step in , but only if china is n't backing n. korea . 
  i 'm also sure the us will handle it . 
  it did n't came through . 
  nope , that 's capitalist . 
  we should stay out of it if we can . 
  just a regular day in slovakian politics . 
  if i were living in slovakia i 'd leave . 
  i 'd rather not be persecuted and most likely fico could have his cake and eat it too . 
  that guy really has a hard on for hating minorities . 
  well e-mail sent . 
  i hope this 'll get thrown out . 
  i 'm all for trying to equalize the differences between genders as much as possible ( there will never be equality imo ) but censorship is not the way to achieve it . 
  in fact it should be quite the opposite . 
  these problems have to be talked through , proper discourse is needed to tackle it instead of sweeping it under the `` carpet '' and hoping it will go away . 
  minimum wage sounds good , but in reality there are other things to consider beside people getting more money . 
  let me explain . 
  there were talks in romania that they will raise the minimum wage and every uneducated person was like `` fuck yeah more money '' , but you have to realise that when minimum wages are increased so does the amount you have to pay in taxes back to the state and other institutions . 
  so while yes , you get more , you wo n't be getting a lot more . 
  the biggest winner here is n't the worker , it 's the state . 
  then the worker and the loser is the employer because he gets to pay more for both the state and the employees . 
  while this might not affect big businesses that much , it could still be a considerable blow to small family businesses while at the same changing almost nothing for the employees in terms of improving their life . 
  with that said , i do n't have a problem with minimum wage and i actually support it . 
  but it still should . 
  if another country builds this `` smart borders '' system i would n't mind if they do n't gather all that info on me if i plan to visit . 
  this is how i see it :  ** pro ** : easy travel with the chip system for aliens ** cons ** : information gathering , tracking of individuals , wasting a lot of money on this and then some more on maintaining it  ** other thoughts ** : cuts number of boarder guards and probably other personnel thus saving money for the state but less people will have jobs if they are laid off . 
   on the other hand that 's 1.1 billion injected into the private sector if they contract european companies ( which they better do instead of going to the usa or china ) + will probably create some jobs since it has to be maintained ... unless of course they move old redundant staff to new positions , in which case everything pretty much stays the same and we just spent a load of money on yet more surveillance . 
  in my view the cons outweigh the pro ( s ) and that 1.1 billion can still be spent on other things that would benefit us more . 
  my house is clean so i almost never wear house shoes . 
  when i was at a university living with three others and where vacuuming was done once a week , i did n't take a step without a house shoe . 
  i sometimes make some too . 
  you ca n't even compare the store bought canned ones to it . 
  bucegi and sibiu are the best of the canned ones imo . 
  ( pork ), 
  yeah , i have an electron as well and it worked everywhere except the playstation store . 
  i want to give them money but they wo n't take it ... sony logic . 
  i have romanian ( 1st ) and hungarian . 
  i did n't really want to get the hungarian citizenship but since i 'm ethnically hungarian and because it was easy to get , i applied . 
  the only benefit that it gives me is that i can go to the uk to steal their jobs ... if i want , but i do n't . 
  this is relevant to my interests as romania does n't have access to the playstation store and sony wo n't take my money if i do n't pay with a debit/credit card from a country that has access . 
  although to be fair you ca n't really force sony to do business in a country it does n't want to , however it would be good if not only would they have to accept payments from every eu country if they do business in at least on of them , the legislators should also work to create a unified system for license agreements so all content across digital online stores would be the same within the whole eu ( well excluding state censorship ex . 
  some nazi videogames in germany ) . 
  yeah , it is done by telling your phone to not connect to networks automatically . 
  he sure got unlucky though . 
  creating an operator that covers the eu equally is challenging imo . 
  logically it does make sense , however think about prices for instance . 
  if they were the same across every eu state then it would n't be fair for poorer countries if for example the prices were tailored to uk wallets . 
  on the other hand it would n't be fair to people with greater spending power if the prices were lowered for poorer ones while theirs would be not . 
  theoretically the operators should set prices for the lowest common denominator however they wo n't do that if they know that they can get more money out of western europe for the same thing . 
  another thing that slows the process is that there probably is n't an operator that has a presence in every eu country at the moment . 
  some might be able to afford to expand , some smaller ones do n't have the money . 
  if vodafone would decide to cover every single country and have the same prices across europe it would immediately put everyone at a disadvantage who does n't have the money to expand . 
  their only choice would be to form a coalition which would mean that they wo n't be the ones to set their own rules and profits will be divided between members . 
  we 'll just have to see what they will come up with , however i 'm not expecting any radical changes any time soon . 
  here it is everyone , the past , current and future prices : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commission_roaming_regulations incoming/outgoing prices are actually acceptable in my opinion . 
  the only thing i do n't like at the moment is data prices . 
  i mean 70 cents for a megabyte is too damn much and it 's not always convenient to get a local sim just for internet . 
  after they 'll reduce it to 20 cents i do n't really see going it much lower though . 
  if you look at the chart , currently data has the most profits , in two years time that 'll be slashed in less than half . 
  personally i wo n't sign what op has posted . 
  the eu seems to me to be capable of reducing costs themselves in a reasonable manner . 
  10 % to waiters and pizza boys . 
  that 's about it for me , but i do n't always tip them either . 
  in venice i was at a restaurant where the tip of the waiter was on the bill . 
  i was actually slightly offended by that because let me be the one to decide whether that waiter has earned it or not . 
  thanks !, 
  so what 's your opinion on it ?
