  do think it was the right thing to do ? 
  i thought the map posted by / u/87cole [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1855or/map_of_europe_in_1648_xpost_from_rmapporn/ ) was pretty interesting and since i have n't seen this on / r/europe yet , i thought i 'd share in case some of you did n't know about the website . 
  the more you zoom in the more specific the maps will be . 
  i have to say that the website is quite remarkable . 
  edit : and of course it 's not limited to europe , but it 's probably the most relevant to our interests . 
  then source please ?

  coldplay `` were '' the ones . 
  i 'll just downvote myself now . 
  i was n't even talking about that . 
  if you had thought it through instead of going into attack mode you 'd have realised that i 'm applauding this because i believe the punishment is ** too harsh ** for non-commercial pirating , i.e. 
  downloading for personal use . 
  i did n't say it should n't be punished at all , but surely [ extraditing someone ] ( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/extraditing-students-for-copyright-claims-jimmy-wales-says-its-wrong/ ) for it to the us is bullshit when he did not break any laws in his own country , trying to [ bankrupt ] ( http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9148318/student_facing_675k_music_piracy_fine_hopeful_award_will_be_lowered ) people with ridiculous charges , [ blackmailing ] ( http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2012-09-13/news/do-porn-companies-blackmail-illegal-downloaders/ ) them to settle out of court or [ censoring ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megaupload#megaupload_song_controversy ) the [ internet ] ( http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-censored-in-ireland-after-mysterious-court-order-121024/ ) is not the way this should be handled . 
  i also would like to own the content i purchase and not licence it , so fuck drm while we are at it . 
  also before you get into it , no i 'm not talking about american companies and organisations , european ones can be just as bad . 
  i 'm just glad legal corruption ( read , lobbying ) is still rather small in europe compared to the us . 
  finally , a step in the right direction . 
  it is ridiculous that you can get your whole life ruined because you shared some files . 
  meh , who cares . 
  nothing will happen to the gypsies , western europe will lecture eastern europe about integration , gypsies wo n't integrate , and basically rounding them up and deporting them or whatever the hell the racists want will not happen until hungary has a totalitarian regime and quits the eu . 
  hungary also not so long ago ( well 4 years ago ) has dissolved the hungarian guard movement which was basically a big nationalist hate group . 
  i know this might come as a shock , but it 's the same here . 
  j/k newspaper articles usually attract the uneducated homophobic lot . 
  i rarely see a reasonable one and if someone dares to post something that might be actually worth something , they 'll be downvoted to oblivion . 
  this is actually stupid . 
  i 'm romanian , but i also happen to have hungarian citizenship ( i 'm ethnic hungarian ) . 
  if i go to a job centre and say i 'm romanian i 'll be sent away , but if i come back next day and say i 'm hungarian they 'll greet me with open arms ? 
  it 's ridiculous because i 'm still the same person . 
  i actually know this has happened to someone . 
  one of my nieces is studying in england ( i would n't have gone , the amount of money her family has to spend is way too much for the average romanian family ) and she had to find a part time , so she went to a job centre and applied as a romanian . 
  they sent her away . 
  next week , she gathered the papers this time applying as a hungarian and they processed her application . 
  she said the clerk even made a remark about it . 
  also the guardian really needs to implement a feature that lets comments and replies to be contracted . 
  the amount of replies that `` lol '' has gathered is bloody annoying , and i see the next comment is a quality piece as well . 
  anyway , i do n't think they 'll be able to persuade anybody . 
  it rains in romania too and most people earn about 200 pounds . 
  i do n't blame some for trying to emigrate in order to try living a better life . 
  well the us is the land of the free , so i guess they think it should be free for them to invade our privacy . 
  it 's a crappy situation that i hope will be resolved , in the end it 's another day in the world of politics . 
  sometimes eu does something stupid , sometimes the us . 
  guess it was the us ' turn this time . 
  ( again ) i 'm feeling a sort of dystopian vibe here . 
  / tin foil hat on / surely there will come a time when total information control and full invasion of privacy will be upon us . 
  but i 'd prefer huxley 's dystopia over orwell 's . 
  edit : btw for those who do n't know huxley = sexual liberalism , free thinking ( well as free as you can after the mind control thing ) , no secret police / orwell = sexual repression , constantly controlled and observed . 
  `` miskolc ... is the second-biggest city in hungary after budapest '' wrong , it 's debrecen . 
  also , i 'm not surprised canada does n't want them . 
  pretty much nobody wants to deal with them . 
  i just wish some states/political leaders would n't act so hypocritical . 
  you do n't want them ? 
  ok , but then do n't lecture us on how to deal with them . 
  eh , i had someone in 12th grade ( that 18years old just in case you might not know ) who did n't know where north , south , w. , e. were . 
  i also had someone who did n't know where italy is , even though italy is probably one of the most recognisable countries on the map ( since it looks like a boot ) . 
  english lit . 
  ma here , from hungary . 
  questions from a course called : terms and concepts in linguistic , literary and cultural studies - language and literature you had to write down everything you know . 
  wittgenstein and language 2 . 
  transgression in culture , language and literature 3 . 
  rhetoric - the anti-rhetorical tradition 4 . 
  role of formalism in linguistics 5 . 
  subjectivity in grammar . 
  basically every test is like this around here . 
  either this or write an essay if it 's a seminar ... i 'd rather write two essays than to do that test again though , especially since i detest linguistics . 
  i regret choosing to go here ... should have gone to something more useful or just skip ma altogether and be self employed at my company while teaching two hours english a day to little kids . 
  so here 's my advice , unless you want to become an academic do n't waste your time on an english lit . 
  you 're out of luck , better pay up . 
  holy crap , there is an initiative that wants to limit speeds to 30km/h . 
  ffs , that 's slow enough for one to get out , take a piss and still have time to sit back in . 
  i would probably trade the 50km/h limit for net neutrality . 
  if i were google , i would just have banned every orange ip from accessing their servers . 
  i ca n't believe they caved in , there would have been a huge uproar that would 've put orange in its place . 
  fuck orange and fuck this mentality . 
  they were already paid by the people , i do n't see why google ( or anyone else for that matter ) should pay them too . 
  good thing i 'm no longer their subscriber . 
  coming up next , they will start billing recipients of sms texts too as some operators do in the us . 
  when isps first proposed this last year i thought this will never pass , yet here we are . 
  i do n't really think selling war to people is hard . 
  it 's hard now since the conflict does n't affect them . 
  basically nobody here cares if there 's a war in afghanistan or mali and those who do only say `` tsk , tsk , shame on you ... make love not war '' . 
  however if things would be different , say , europeans would be threatened directly , they could be persuaded more easily . 
  people can be conditioned to support war through propaganda , scaremongering and charismatic leaders . 
  britain did the same thing before wwii for instance . 
  good . 
  drm only gets in the way of legitimate customers . 
  i wish more companies would realise this . 
  i was an avid pirate a few years ago ( nowadays i just get tv shows and books for academic purposes only , i 'm not that keen on reading ) and if it had n't been for cd projekt and the witcher 2 , i would 've stayed that way . 
  i was impressed with their decision to release a aaa game without drm , so impressed that i bought it for full price and now i 'd rather get a game from either them or steam if the price is right ( here 's a wisdom my friend said , `` the price is always right , you just do n't have enough money '' ) because it 's more convenient then to pirate ( with all the hassle downloading , rars , image mounting , installation , cracking and long uninstall times ) i know steam is itself a drm system , however i know that i can get a cracked copy of everything i own if i want to so i 'm willing to buy in . 
  quite frankly that 's the main reason i do n't really want a digital only console . 
  unlike a pc , you ca n't back up your things and if the company decides to take the stuff you paid for away , then you 're screwed . 
  going back to the witcher 2 , i think most consumers who are concious about drm would respect and maybe open their wallets easier if the companies that sell the media to us would n't try to bullshit us and limit what we can do with the things we buy from them . 
  oh great ... nope . 
  the idea of them joining up and creating a super isp is horrible . 
  `` it could also yield consumer benefits , such as ** single pricing ** for telecoms and internet services ** across europe ** . '', 
  yes because i clearly want to pay what the west ( especially us ) pays for internet . 
  if they are unifying pricing i hope they 'll adopt it from rds-rcs . 
  because $ 9 gets you unlimited bandwidth with speeds up to [ 100mbps ] ( http://speedtest.net/result/1857851822.png ) fibre-optic lines , free mobile internet through a cdma usb dongle and free access to hotspots around the country . 
  screw data caps and screw throttling , i do n't know how the people in the us put up with that shit . 
  also it will be easier for mafiaa puppets to sue people because if they can convince/force a european wide isp to dish out customer info , it would affect the whole continent instead of a single country .
