  food markets sell honey from local bee keepers while supermarkets sell them from ( multi ) national companies . 
  i still ca n't believe a piece of eden has caused it . 
  because in unity there is [ powaaaaaaaaa !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbp7mtt3ac ), 
  yup , i know the language was clearly inspired by german . 
  yup , 
  well now i know from where the coat of arms of redania and temeria were inspired from . 
  ford owners , represent !, 
  my 2012 mondeo has mixed consumption of 6.5 l as well but i do n't think i could get it to go down to 4.4 l in grandmother mode . 
  what model have you got ? 
  my dash shows when i should shift up but it boggles my mind how ford thinks shifting up under 2000 rpm for a diesel is a good thing in the long run . 
  i 'm pretty sure there would be national protests if they would introduce data caps as for coverage , probably metropolitan areas , but that 's just my guess . 
  absolutely i trade you cheap internet for cheap vehicle tax ? 
  deal ? 
  i 'd rather not have my dream car than to pay 2000 euros yearly to government . 
  there would probably a nice incentive for the target country built into the deal ( like trade agreement , flat out cash , aid etc. ) . 
  i 'm sure they could get libya to agree to this one way or another . 
  they were hyping this up on instagram all week . 
  ah i misunderstood , i thought about some stuff that while not life threatening will still make life pretty bad . 
  gastric bands are n't even covered by the national healthcare system here afaik so i 'm surprised they are in the uk . 
  absolutely and crash diets suck . 
  i 'd protest against this . 
  the whole point of the system is that everyone gets basic treatment . 
  either abolish the system or leave everything as is . 
  i 'd have no qualm if you could voluntarily abstain from paying the insurance tax and then not get medical treatment ( although i 'd personally would still contribute ) . 
  i 'm sure a lot of people in romania would do that since most of the time you 'll have to buy medicine/disposable equipment and you have to give money to nurses anyway , plus conditions are shite . 
  at that point they 'd rather keep the money that gets deducted from their salary and pay through the nose at a private clinic once they 're sick . 
  ( with arguably has way better conditions ), 
  i 'm not trolling but it 's actually not that hard , rather it takes a pretty long time . 
  it took me two years to lose 55 kg . 
  since we can have almost anything on demand instantly those stupid fad diets are popular like the `` 30 day '' diet which will make you miserable and once you stop you 'll go back to your old habits and gain the weight back and people then declare that they tried but simply ca n't lose weight . 
  i admit that not everyone 's situation is the same so there surely are legitimate reasons why losing weight can be hard , however building up the willpower and discipline to say no to food is the key . 
  i 've been fat all my life and looking back now to the weight loss process , it was n't as hard as my fat self imagined it would be . 
  +1 definitely a good idea . 
  [ carei ] ( http://visitcarei.ro/index.php/en/ ) ( got ta promote the hometown ) 2 . 
  [ bicaz gorge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicaz_gorge ) there are just too many imo to easily choose . 
  but downloading a torrent through pia is a pita . 
  plus it 's technically against their eula . 
  i personally use them to have access to comixology . 
  got ta get those blocked comics . 
  i am now an english teacher because of video games and cartoon network . 
  i tell it to every parent i speak with to change the language on the cartoons to english instead of romanian/hungarian . 
  it would still be useful to have it there . 
  i go read the wiki on subreddits which tell me to go read the wiki either in a sticky or in the sidebar like / r/fitness , / r/learnjapanese, 
  [ shame !, 
  forever or included in the wiki . 
  in fact , the wiki totally should have a section like this . 
  before euro the german mark was a popular currency to use for high value stuff here in the partium region, 
  i actually do n't remember either , i just do n't want to feel too old :( ( ( and the only thing i know is i was little when we got cable tv . 
  also thanks and your english is excellent , 
  same for me . 
  english from cartoon network and video games , but i think cn came to romania earlier than 1998 . 
  i keep telling parents with small children that whatever they do , they should n't let the kids watch cartoons in their mother language , but nobody gives a shit :( instead they send the kids to private lessons . 
  i managed to get a master 's degree in english lit . 
  thanks to cartoon network . 
  i also learned german from rtl ii , watching anime with vampy , schultz and tj , then pokito tv and right after that they always showed the fresh prince of bel air ( dubbed in german of course ) . 
  i also know hungarian and romania and i can understand some words in japanese . 
  my next goal is to learn french then japanese and with 6 languages i should be fine . 
  ** tl ; dr 4 languages , english , german , hungarian , romanian **, 
  try kaufland or lidl in house brands of twix or mars . 
  in my opinion they taste way better than the original brands . 
  carei < 3, 
  :o why ? 
  annoyed me too and since it 's a slow day at work here is it straight http://imgur.com/a/lk1he, 
   az apostolok cselekedetei szerint az \u00e1rul\u00f3 j\u00fad\u00e1s hely\u00e9re v\u00e1lasztott apostol m\u00edg ugye m\u00e1t\u00e9 ott volt az og crew-ba also just in case anyone is interested , the name matthew would be matheus or mateus instead of matthias, 
  yeah but he 's saying m\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly should n't be called matei corvin in romanian because matei is romanian for m\u00e1t\u00e9 , so they are calling him m\u00e1t\u00e9 kir\u00e1ly . 
  also i 'm not the most religious person but afaik there is no m\u00e1ty\u00e1s apostole . 
  i do n't know why we ca n't be like the swiss , legalise downloading for personal use ... and i 'm not only saying that to play the stereotype of the pirate romanian ( i pay for my stuff ), 
  what a waste . 
  looks like they do n't have it that bad otherwise they would n't throw their product out instead of selling it . 
  i never understood these kind of protests ... we 'll protest by destroying the shit we make and the government only has to clean it up , which let 's be frank will probably cost less than the damage they did to themselves ... especially if they use cheap labour ( granted that might not be available in brussels ), 
  it 's cite but you are completely right . 
  i did n't mean that comment to be taken that seriously and it is absolutely un scientific . 
  it is just my personal experience . 
  it 's true . 
  it 's still 12 ^ o c during the day and only 0 during the night and december is next week . 
  i remember , when i was a kid a snow was everywhere by now and we had a lot more white christmases than now . 
  the situation of the minorities ( not just hungarian and german ) that were n't jewish or roma was n't quite so bad . 
  instead of outright genocide , they were oppressed and move the labour camps on the whim of the romanian authorities during the antonescu regime . 
  if you take your time you can find a lot of interesting info about the happenings in romania from a hungarian perspective at the two sources below . 
  i ca n't provide english or romanian sources , but here are some in hungarian . 
  [ via google translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fbalogh.adatbank.transindex.ro%2f%3fkeres%3d%26szo%3dmunkat%25c3%25a1bor%26kev%3d1940%26kho%3d8%26knap%3d30%26vev%3d1944%26vho%3d9%26vnap%3d12%26submit.x%3d0%26submit.y%3d0 ) [ via google translate , august 19 , mentions that hungarians were interned into labour camps ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvincze.adatbank.transindex.ro%2findex.php%3faction%3dhonap%26ev%3d1945%26honap%3d8%26kat%3d ) it 's obvious though that it can not compare to what the jews had to go through and in the broad scheme of things this is something very local and small which makes it understandable that there is almost zero talk about it . 
  edit : formatting, 
  do n't leave out hungarians from the concentration camps in romania , while swabians and saxons were either sent to gulags in russia or deported to germany . 
  heh , no worries , i 'm a hungarian too by the way  . 
  i personally would get the kia or the mazda , never liked the fabia . 
  good luck mate !, 
  thanks for the explanation it makes sense , though be frank i didn ` nt even think about slovakia having so few votes . 
  man just look at the racism is a problem in / r/europe one ( gradient ) . 
  slovakia agrees to such an extent that they are completely white :p i know they probably were n't coloured in , but it 's rather ironic if we assume that question also covers xenophobia . 
  to leave us alone ? 
  dammit , not again . 
  whenever i 'm reminded of this guy , i always remember a song i heard when he became pm . 
  i literally never heard of him before that so this one song really stuck with me . 
  so all i can say is : [ who the fuck is bajnai gordon ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/ycpn3jp20zi?t=1m55s ) ** nsfw ** if you 're hungarian and have the speakers on i 'll show myself out now , since i do n't have anything worthwhile to contribute ... 
  to be fair , i 'd rather not have a trade agreement with the us if it 's shit like acta . 
  i used to take my 2002 to small garages for years , but they either did a lousy job or it took days/weeks for them to do shit and only did a mediocre job . 
  in that time i did maintenance whenever i heard something or felt something wrong , or if the mechanic noticed something when it was with him for an oil change . 
  for the last two years i took my old mondeo directly to a dealer .
