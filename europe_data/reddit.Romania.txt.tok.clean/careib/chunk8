  with a dealer you get an appointment and they know exactly when it will be done , plus they know what they are doing because they actually got training from ford ( they have their own racing team too and the owner is a pretty nice guy too ) . 
  you can also get a loyalty discount and if the car is registered under a company ( mine is ) instead of an individual you can take it abroad for servicing and you ** do n't have to pay the vat ** ( within the eu ) , at all . 
  so with these combined , i pay ~ 40 % less . 
  not bad if you ask me . 
  granted , if you do n't live close to another country 's border ( ex . 
  i 'm at the dealer in half an hour in my neighbouring country ) , it 's probably not worth wasting the time and money on fuel to get there , but if you take it to a dealer , at least you know that the car is being maintained by people who actually know what they are doing . 
  for me it is worth the premium . 
  plus the dealer has records of maintenance and in romania you can ask more for cars if you tell to the shopper that it was maintained at a dealer because you actually have proof that yes the car is in good condition . 
  i sold my mondeo this year for exactly $ 4000 . 
  but it only had around 160k kms in it . 
  since yours is newer i 'm sure you could go over $ 5000-6000 . 
  if you really want to switch cars , i 'd say either go with a focus kombi ( or estate or station wagon , [ caravan is something else ] ( http://www.carinsurancequotes.uk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/photo-caravan.jpg ) ) , i assume this is what you meant , or a c-max . 
  the new c-max is pretty good though . 
  i like the design , it has a lot space for luggage and the seller will remark that it has a button which automatically closes the trunk door , which admittedly is pretty neat . 
  ( the fuckers do n't have this as an option for the mondeo , one of the disappointments i was talking about ) hope you get things sorted out and good luck . 
  had one from 2002 , a ghia . 
  now have a 2012 titanium ( 8k km in it so far ) 2.0 litre , 140 hp ; a petrol focus from 2006 , 1.6 litre ; and a 2000 transit . 
  the mondeo is a cool car , but there were some disappointments . 
  the engine noise is really low though , and no , when the engine is idling i do n't hear a loud noise . 
  it 's not as good as a petrol car , but both the noise reduction and vibration absorption have been improved from the previous model imo . 
  you might notice a difference because of the cold weather . 
  cars now have automatic fuel regulation and it will give the engine more fuel if its not warmed up , which in turn would raise your idling rpm making the engine a bit louder . 
  if it 's not that and the guys at a ford service tell you everything 's ok , i would n't worry . 
  although if it 's really really bothering you , try asking the guys at talkford.com or just to be sure , get it looked at , by another dealer . 
  as for sturdiness , i completely agree . 
  i 'm sure they built it properly , but i also have a feeling of i 'd say isolation . 
  you just do n't connect with the car , you do n't feel the road , you do n't hear the wind , it keeps the rpm up during shifts for smooth shifting , i do n't even have to use a key to start it . 
  it 's cool but at the same time it feels wrong , i ca n't really give a concrete description . 
  it 's a computer first and car second i guess . 
  i hope you 're car is okay , i personally never did n't really have big problems with fords and that 's why i stayed with the brand . 
  because everyone is a prick , we just try to vote in the one that is n't the worst . 
  i personally would n't mind seeing [ klaus johaniss ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_iohannis ) as pm just so i could see whether he 's able to take the country in a better direction . 
  yeah , but in the end ford is still an american brand . 
  even though ford of europe is different i 'm sure the money goes to the mother company in the usa . 
  nope , i 'm with ford , a mondeo . 
  but i had europeans , oltcit , dacia , renault , fiat . 
  hey , i would n't mind having at least 1k in front of me right now . 
  fair enough , i also would n't like stoned people causing trouble where i live . 
  exactly !, 
  that 's my point . 
  well if they 'd ban it for tourists i 'm sure that a number of people wo n't really have any reason to go to the netherlands since you do n't have to travel anywhere to be not allowed to smoke weed anyway . 
  so what are they saying ? 
  here you go . 
  i like how everybody thinks we do n't try to integrate gypsies and then will give us a lecture to us about it . 
  or that everything here is shit or that the press will name them gypsies when they are doing a sympathetic approach , but call them romanians when they do a negative ( i.e. 
  crime ) thus portraying to the west that we all are criminals . 
  i admit that with some menial work you can earn substantially more in germany than you ever could in romania but things are n't that bad around here . 
   `` wretched conditions and bleak prospects '' their in that situation because they skip school and do n't work . 
  i personally would n't care about gypsies if i knew they would become or at least try to become productive members of society . 
  the hate is n't about race or ethnicity . 
  the hate is more similar to what westerners feel about homeless bums or free loaders . 
  it 's about their position in society in the negative effects on it . 
  education is free ( yes we even have scholarship specifically for gypsies at universities ) and they get some money/food thanks to social aids ( which of course is paid by those who pay taxes ) . 
  even if you live in squalor you can send your children to school so they become educated which will give them the ability to find a job . 
  i 'm not saying that they will become rich , but in a generation it would be possible to break out of the `` wretched conditions '' . 
  ( a job is enough for you to rent an apartment and pay bills/food , except you have to keep that apartment clean if you do n't want it to turn into the crap from where you escaped from ) if learning is n't your thing , then ok , do n't , but then get off your ass and earn your bread through physical labour if that 's what it will take . 
  ( i.e. 
  what the family in the article are trying to do ) as a current example i 'd just like to point out [ ol\u00e1h gerg\u0151 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdqjg2pz0mw ) who is currently competing in the hungarian x-factor . 
  he did n't have a high paying job , he was a public worker , maximum they can earn is [ 47k forints , maybe something more because if you children you have to pay marginally lower taxes ] ( http://nol.hu/belfold/egy_kozmunkas_havi_122_ezerbe_kerul ) and he is smart enough to realise that he needs to provide for his family will work his ass off doing what he can . 
  but for most it 's easier to make 3 + kids , take up the aid and send them out the entrances of a hypermarkets to beg or take the change out of the push baskets ( to be fair at least this is n't as annoying as outright begging , but hey ** kids ** are out there doing it ) while they sit at home watching tv because they will sure as fuck pay for [ satellite tv ] ( http://www.poze-haioase.ro/pozehaioase.php?id=72] . 
  ( i can even take a picture out of my own home town if you want ) any way i do n't want to make this comment even longer so i 'll conclude with saying , good luck to both the gypsies and the germans who will try to help them . 
   the far-right romanian mep there 's your problem . 
  vadim tudor is a prick . 
  he hates everything and everybody who is n't romanian . 
  until the current generation of politicians wo n't die out and the mindset of romanian society as a whole wo n't shift , things will not be different . 
  do n't forget that communism and dictatorship only ended 22 years ago ( almost 23 now ) . 
  democracy is still crap because the same politicians who were part of the communist regime were and are in control . 
  everybody is a relative of everybody and the country is run by background interests . 
  while corruption has been lowered it 's still existent . 
  pretty much destroyed cfr ( the state railway ) but state universities are no better at all for instance . 
  you do n't buy the book of the professor , fuck you , good luck with your studies . 
  do n't want to take a test , just hand over $ 100 and get a pretty good grade ( my room mate does this ) . 
  * edit : but you still got to buy the damned book * lower and lower-middle class romanians also do n't give a damn . 
  they do n't like to work and are uneducated . 
  the xenophobia i see in some comment sections is incredible . 
  they hate the hungarians , they hate the gypsies , they even hate each other ( romanians from transylvania hate romanians from moldova and wallachia and vice versa ) . 
  going back to stupidity , if a romanian does n't pay for a ticket on a tram or a train the other passengers will fucking try to protect him from getting caught or simply wo n't give a damn because fuck the system right ? 
  they do n't realise however that these are partially run from their taxes . 
  effectively they do n't realise that they are protecting the person who just indirectly robbed them and made things shittier for everybody because the company wo n't be able to afford a new modern carriage for instance . 
  another thing is that romania compared to italy or greece is both culturally and economically less significant . 
  that 's the awful truth . 
  we and bulgaria are the poorest nations within the eu and while bucharest was the paris of the east at one time , communism came and turned everything into crap , severely limiting arts , education , economy , politics ... bloody everything . 
  we could go on and on about it . 
  i 'm not saying you should n't be mad , because fuck them , it 's unfair for the people who did n't do anything wrong , but things are still shitty around here . 
  do n't ignore it . 
  things are shitty there too , look at exactly italy and greece , but they can at least bash romania and bulgaria in the press so people there will worry more about gypsies camping outside their house than greece going bankrupt and the eu dumping a crap load of money into a situation that might have been avoidable . 
  i 'll get back to you in a day or two . 
  thanks and i 'll do it op . 
  i 'll read it anyway so it 's not a big deal to write it down for easy reading . 
  also it looks like `` dali dali dal '' is actually and probably two different poems . 
  the first is about a lover and the second ( which starts at those white swan ) is about missing home and his mother . 
  one last thing . 
  does the page on the second picture really start with a small letter ? 
  just in case do check whether it 's like that in the notebook . 
  it 'd be a shame if a page is missing . 
  another last last thing . 
  do you know who j. 
  a. mueller is ? 
  no prob and thank you too for sharing !, 
  since it looks like it continues , if it 's not a problem would you share with us the rest of the poem ?
