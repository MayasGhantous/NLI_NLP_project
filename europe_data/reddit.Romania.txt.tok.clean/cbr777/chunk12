  strictly speaking the war began when germany invaded poland , the ussr invaded poland two weeks later , not on sept 1st like germany . 
   no , it 's not . 
  you are thinking like the people that believe reptilians live among us . 
  or that aliens are known to the government . 
  just waiting for that final smoking gun to proof them `` right '' . 
  well if proof ever is shown that those people are right than they were right all along and everyone that did n't believe it are the idiots , but that 's besides the point because you 're arguing against a straw man . 
  the difference between me thinking that the russian army is involved in ukraine and the people that think aliens visited earth is that my thinking was based on historical precedent and knowledge of russian operating procedure . 
  believing that the russian army was involved did n't require `` belief in aliens '' , it only required that when you add 2 +2 you trust that the result really is 4 and not 3 or 5 . 
   you believe that yelling `` i told you so '' entails a victory , while it only makes you look gullible . 
  if being right means i 'm gullible i 'll assume the risk . 
  i 'd rather be gullible and right than wrong and `` wise '' . 
   you 're quite unfriendly you know . 
  i did n't verbally assault you , i only said you were wrong . 
  you should try to be more responsive to criticism if you ever want to be taken seriously in the real world . 
  i only accept criticism from people i respect , do you think you fall in that category ? 
  to gain my respect you actually have to be right about something , and that has n't happened yet . 
  i was referring to the general attitude russians have at playing the victim , how really all of this is the west 's fault for not taking poor russia 's feelings into account . 
  here 's a wake up call you idiot , nobody in in east europe wants to have anything to do with you , you did n't lose europe because of the west , you lost it because russia is n't nor has it ever been anything but an imperialistic , blood thirsty shithole that most europeans would n't be caught dead living in . 
  russia is n't a victim , it never has and at the way it 's acting never will be , it 's like a husband that beats his wife and than says he loves her when she files for divorce . 
   its a process , i know  clearly one you have no concept about , but that 's to be expected , you 're russian . 
  you have no experience with diplomacy between equals . 
  absolutely disgusting attempt at playing the victim . 
  i 'm sure the entire division was taking part in an exercise and by the weirdest of accidents the entire division crossed into ukraine . 
  funny how that happens . 
  ca n't really block it if the rest agree , but they certainly will fight against it . 
  please tell me that your comment is satire ... 
  the entire division is coming down with a severe case of lead poisoning , i bet it 's from the old water pipes . 
  seems reasonable right ? 
   factories are owned by oligarchs that 's actually not really true . 
  take for example [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malyshev_factory ) one . 
  that 's probably the biggest tank factory in ukraine . 
  but really now , where 's the proof ? 
  there 's no proof of russian soldiers in ukraine , anyone that says differently is a russophobe . 
  absolutely no russian troops in ukraine ... oh , except the ones that were captured , but yeah except those , absolutely no russian troops in ukraine , you can trust the russian government to tell the truth . 
   sure , in that regard they were dragging their feet at that point . 
  so i was right and you were wrong , thanks for agreeing with me . 
   what 's wrong with federalisation or autonomy ? 
  germany itself is a federal republic where the l\u00e4nder have a great deal of autonomy , why would it be strange that it 's an obvious way to them to resolve regional differences ? 
  are you a fucking idiot ? 
  federalization of ukraine transforms ukraine into a russia puppet permanently , there would be no eu integration , not now not ever since russia would practically have direct control of ukraine 's eastern provinces . 
  federalization is ** not ** an option . 
   regardless of what scenarios they floated , it still marks kiev as important and legitimate . 
  no , it fucking does n't . 
  it looked more like she went there to tell ukraine to knock it out and give putin what he wants because she wants business as usual . 
   now that would be naive and ineffective . 
  what do you expect that the reaction to that is going to be ? 
  `` i 'm sorry frau merkel , i 'll never do it again , please do n't punish me ! '' ? 
  if anything that will just provoke them into more rash actions just to show that they do n't give in to demands from anybody . 
  i expect it would show some fucking leadership , i expect germany to stick by its allies , i expect for germany to support a country that 's been invaded and not actually take the side of the invader because your gas price might get higher . 
   of course , because that will necessitate putin to strike back just to show he 's still the biggest badass in the kremlin , or face a deep fall down from power . 
  that 's the logic they 're caught in . 
  no , that 's the logic you 're caught in , the rest of us know that you do n't stop a bully by giving in or ignoring him . 
  the only `` logic '' putin and russia 's political elites in general understand are those of strength . 
   if that 's enough , why not ? 
  time is on the side of ukraine . 
  let them starve , they 'll surrender on their own . 
  alternatives are relative autonomy or some language rights within ukraine ( which they were getting anyway ) , or a cooling down of the conflict until it 's no longer a military matter , or whatever has enough symbolic but little practical value . 
  you truly have no fucking idea what you 're talking about , if ukraine backs out now , they at the very best scenario will be forced into a federalization that will cripple the entire country or at worst russia will outright annex the entire eastern part of it , with the possibility of episode three happening with the entire south of ukraine . 
  you think this would be the end of it ? 
  not by any measure , if ukraine lets russia annex the east , we 'll see the same exact movie again , only this time the city will be odessa . 
  are you really going to post the same bullshit reply every single fucking time ? 
  you make absurd assertions without a shred of proof like you have any fucking clue of what you speak of . 
  yeah ... none of those are actually by any rational measure money that russia gave ukraine , nor does russia have and claim to request repayment , also you might have missed how russia annexed crimea and its related economic zone , i think a fair estimation of the gas and oil reserves alone are more than 200 billion and we have n't even counted anything in crimea yet . 
  of all the ego to request repayment from a country whos territory you illegally invaded and annexed . 
   by imposing sanctions germany had to be dragged to implement sanctions , when pretty much every single nato and eu member was pushing for sanctions , germany could n't afford to look like they were defending russia by themselves , but in no way did they implement the sanctions willingly . 
   contradicting what putin says and further legitimizing kiev 's government with her visit a few days ago ? 
  oh you mean the one where she said she favors `` autonomy '' and one day latter her foreign minister has a freudian slip and says `` federalization '' ? 
  is that the trip you 're referring to ? 
   russia has been escalating this confrontation into a hot war for months . 
  continuing the escalation is swallowing the bait they 've thrown out . 
  russia has lost the diplomatic and economic game at the moment yanukovich was chased back to moscow . 
  they lost the whole of ukraine in the battle with ink and gold and now they 're just seeing how much of their loss they can recover with blood and iron . 
  there would n't be a problem if merkel was pushing for de-escalation by asking putin to withdraw the russian troops from ukraine and stop military support for the terrorists , but she is n't . 
  on the other hand berlin is `` worried '' about ukrainian military successes that wo n't let putin `` save face '' . 
  well fuck putin and fuck merkel . 
  when she means de-escalation what she 's really referring to is stopping the ukrainian army from advancing and possibly pulling back some so that putin can `` save face '' , that is what i mean by appeasement . 
  appeasement , which is what merkel is doing currently , is in no way weakening russian power , the very concept is absurd . 
   yeah lets give them what they want , that will surely weaken their negotiating position are you for real ? 
   i hope for your sake that you 're right , but that 's what everyone said before hyperinflation came around . 
  no , actually nobody ever said that . 
   that 's an unfounded assertion . 
  i do n't think that sentence means what you think it means . 
  well as it happens , this guy was already in prison for another crime ( yeah we had some really awesome guys ) and this new sentence will be added to whatever he had left from the old one . 
  you are a complete lunatic . 
  ukraine should really surrender , merkel wants a better deal on russian gas and this whole war thing is really putting some roadblocks in that plan . 
   that actually is cognitive dissonance on your part . 
  we call it `` diplomacy '' , and we know that you win some , you lose some . 
  this is not a situation good for losing . 
  no , this is what it 's called ** bullshit ** . 
  what exactly did `` we '' win ? 
  who 's `` we '' by the way ? 
  you talk about win some lose some , but what merkel is doing is being a fucking sellout , i 'm literally disgusted by this attitude . 
   what do you expect us to do ? 
  nuke moscow ? 
  i expect you as a nation to grow a fucking spine and not sellout your allies for cheaper gas . 
  you have to be out of your mind to think any action germany has taken in relation to the ukrainian crises has been for the good of the eu . 
  every single time i hear something from merkel about this is another capitulation in front of russia . 
  merkel and germany have n't been leaders , she 's been acting like i 'd expect from one of putin 's lackeys and worst of all i have n't heard of any other voice from germany taking merkel to task about this . 
  is [ this ] ( http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2014-01-29/crisis-ukraine-first-step-towards-compromise ) the one you mean ? 
  if you can try to find it that would be awesome .
