  the german constitutional court asked for guidance ( read : passed the issue ) to the european court of justice and the ecj has yet to issue a ruling on this . 
  as such the ecb is still fully within its mandate and will still be fully within its mandate to perform qe as long as the ecj does n't say it ca n't . 
  the problem is the same one as before . 
  the ecb is basing its monetary policy on what germany needs instead of what the eurozone as a whole needs . 
  in its blind and never ending war on inflation , draghi allowed the bundesbank to take everyone to the brink of deflation . 
  completely expected , anyone with any sense knew this was coming for a long time . 
  three brigades ? 
  that 's like 10.000 soldiers , i doubt russia was able to sneak in so many men so quickly , i have to call bullshit on this until i see actual proof . 
  uh ... no ? 
  that 's a terrible idea . 
  well yes , but by giving such `` causes '' it would force an investigation if a complaint would be filed . 
  such an investigation would take time to finish , if they did n't give any motive there would n't be any investigation . 
  because wto . 
  what does it matter if they intercepted it or not ? 
  it 's not an invasion if they have n't intercepted it ? 
  you asked for proof that russia invaded ukraine and i gave you proof , now you 're just moving the goal posts to something completely unrelated . 
  not that that 's a surprise , i 've known you 're either a troll or an imbecile for quite a while . 
  you mean like [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/russian-military-vehicles-enter-ukraine-aid-convoy-stops-short-border ) or [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11035401/russian-armoured-vehicles-and-military-trucks-cross-border-into-ukraine.html ) ? 
  yeah only the ukrainian army reported it , not like nato confirmed it also . 
  oh really ? 
  let me point you to [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dbgp3/ukraine_is_winning_the_war_but_will_putin_invade/cjo2x7n ) . 
  where you said :  he wo n't invade for no reason and no gain what do you think yesterday 's armored column that was reported by everybody was ? 
  do you have another definition for sending armored columns into foreign countries that is n't an invasion ? 
  was that supposed to be a witty reply ? 
  do n't worry , i 'm sure you 'll be funny some day . 
  do n't give up trying . 
  no no no , do n't you know crimea annexed itself to russia , russia had absolutely no involvement in it , all those nice men with assault weapons and apcs were crimean citizens expressing their displeasure at the nazis in kiev . 
  absolutely no russian military was involved . 
  also if you believe that i have a piece of land sitting on an oil field i want to sell you . 
  oh look another new account with a pro russian opinion , there seems to be an epidemic going around . 
  you might want to flair with the `` earth '' flair so you can get recognized as a troll faster . 
  you know what 's also exceedingly easy ? 
  to be a chicken shit armchair general when you 're on the other fucking side of the continent . 
  i 'm expecting angela 's next phone call with putin to be extra stern , she might even raise her voice this time . 
  good , i hope it 's true . 
  i was worried that the ukrainian army might not have the guts to actually attack the russian armored column , glad to see they did . 
  i expect that putin will claim no russian military units are in ukraine , as such any attack was made against the separatists . 
  as if anyone cares what the eu 's own mini putin thinks about anything . 
  could n't very well have let the trucks be inspected while they were still full of weapons and military supplies now could they ? 
   do you think putin is literally hitler ? 
  read up on history [ 1 ] , man . 
  hitler was n't `` hitler '' in 1938 , perhaps you should be the one that does some studying before talking . 
   what happened so far is two orders of magnitude lower than that . 
  oh really ? 
  annexing crimea , supporting terrorists and now outright invading ukraine , yeah clearly two orders of magnitude lower , because invading and attempting to annex parts of ukraine is ** literally ** 100 times less than invading and annexing parts of czechoslovakia . 
  are you getting paid for this or are you simply that stupid ? 
   this should be the frame of reference . 
  not comparisons with chamberlain for trying to keep calm and find a constructive way out . 
  it 's much too early for that . 
  why ? 
  because you say so ? 
  comparisons with chamberlain are not only fair , they are unavoidable at this point , all we 're waiting for is angela to fly a piece of paper in our face and claim to have secured peace and a nice export contract for germany . 
  should probably start calling her `` chicken shit '' angela from now on . 
  a whole lot of good her `` talking '' with putin has done up to now . 
  the financial sanctions are starting to bite , the rest of the russian banks and companies will have to do the same thing , the russian government does n't have the money to help all of them . 
  russia invading a neighboring country !? 
  that never happens ... 
  i ca n't stand to eat slanina , it tastes terrible to me and i also do n't see a reason to eat fat . 
  oh god no !, 
  i hate that shit . 
  romania and bulgaria are pretty far from crimea for small boats to make the trip , so you 'd need bigger ones which are easier to locate . 
  not sure many people would be in a hurry to risk getting caught by russian navy for food smuggling . 
  you could end up being prosecuted for spying or something like that . 
  seems like a sound plan to me . 
  well , i guess that would depend on who 's moving the stuff over the border . 
  if it 's the importer than yes , but if it 's the reseller than he 's getting in trouble for smuggling i would imagine . 
  it 's hilarious that you think russia is still a democracy , democracy implies having real and fair elections , russia does n't have that . 
  unless you think whole provinces having more votes than voters by over 40-50 % represent `` fair '' elections . 
  i have no doubt that some of the banned products that can be found in belarus will find their way into russia being resold with a markup . 
  wow , another one . 
  [ look here if incapable of googling ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot ) . 
  i 'll even quote it for you :  a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices ; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group ( as a racial ** or ethnic group ** ) with hatred and intolerance, 
  i 'll just leave this [ here ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot ) because apparently you really are that stupid . 
  the rest of your post is yawn inducing . 
   from a linguistics perspective , that fact that a large number of native speakers of english use the word that way , and that it 's commonly understood even if some other native speakers would wish that they used a different word or consider it to be wrong , means that is what the word now means . 
  it 's unscientific pseudo-pedantry to try and pretend any differently . 
  you know what i understand from that `` extended use '' that they just added at the end ? 
  that 's another way of saying `` some people who do n't know any better use this word wrongly to express this other thing '' . 
  just because some native english speakers use it wrongly , does not mean i have to accept it as correct , especially not when there is a perfectly good word that expresses exactly what the user means to say . 
   it 's unscientific pseudo-pedantry to try and pretend any differently . 
  says you , if the oed would actually agree with this bullshit , they 'd change the fucking definition of the word , but they did n't , they added it at the end as an afterthought . 
   but they are an ethnic group , the definitions of racism includes discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on ethnic hatred or stereotypes . 
  umm no it does n't include that . 
  see [ link ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism ) . 
  the word you 're looking for is bigot , not racist . 
   then why has n't he done it ? 
  because why invade and bring on the fury of every nation when you can support separatists and get the same thing only at less cost . 
   if he 's just a crazed soviet dictator obsessed with territorial gain , and has no concern whatsoever for the international situation or for actually gaining anything tangible where did i say that ? 
  putin is many things but crazed is n't one of them . 
  he 's actually quite rational and effective in his actions . 
  perhaps you should note that most of the sanctions only came after a civilian airplane was shot down by accident , before that russia supplied men and weapons to the separatists without almost no punishment . 
  also saying that he 's not gaining anything from this is crazy , he already gained crimea by doing exactly the same thing he 's doing now . 
   watching hundreds of thousands of russian troops occupying kiev and lviv ? 
  when i said that russian political thinking is that ukraine is n't a real country , that did n't mean they think they can just walk into kiev and take over , but they may very well still invade eastern ukraine and take that . 
   he wo n't invade for no reason and no gain he does have reason and not losing is gaining from his perspective . 
  the reason putin could very well still order an invasion is because he has the belief , and this is a belief shared by many political leaders in moscow , is that ukraine is n't a real country . 
  they believe ukraine should be part of federal russia and they see this break from kiev as a massive threat to russia . 
  turks are n't a race , just have to point that out . 
   but did n't he state many times , that he does not want to support the seperatists ? 
  if he does n't want to support them than why does he ?
