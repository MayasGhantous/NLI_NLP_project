   show-trials i see you using that word a lot ... it does n't mean what you think it means . 
  please stop using it as you are , you are making a mockery of it . 
  no , there are n't . 
  at least not currently , most people think they should just be investigated as a matter of `` fairness '' , regardless that there are no known acts to investigate them for currently . 
  not that i think they are clean , but i also do n't believe there should be investigations just so we can say ... well they are going after everyone . 
   if he does n't control the government and has n't for such a long time then who is being allowed to ahead with this . 
  i 'm sorry but the corruption ran deep as you know and if basescu has n't run the government since 2012 then who is behind this happening . 
  ( the corruption being gotten rid of ) that is a very complicated question . 
  when / u/dorinmaxmilian said that basescu does n't control the government anymore , he 's right but not in the sense you 're taking it . 
  the history of basescu 's presidency goes something like this : after the mass election in 2004 , basescu won the presidency and the political alliance that supported him won enough votes in parliament that by forming alliances with other parties they were able to form a government . 
  during this period romania was not yet in the eu ( eu accession for romania was on jan 1st 2007 ) and as such the eu was putting on a massive amount of pressure to get an independent functioning justice system going . 
  a lot of very important laws were passed during this time due to this pressure , one of them massively buffed up the dna ( special anticorruption prosecutors ) which before this change were very ineffective and toothless . 
  the new leaders put in these places were much newer people , that had no/or a lot less ties with the older political operatives . 
  you have to realize that all of these changes take time and even more important than changing laws , is changing mentality and changing the people . 
  the old guard was n't sitting around doing nothing , it was fighting back at every step and corrupt and corruptable people still worked in the system , because throwing them out required proof and motive and that 's a lot harder to come by than just changing a few laws . 
  additionally to the ** slowly ** changing of the justice system was the complete clean up of the internal security service . 
  this is actually one of the things basescu did right most of all , but it 's not something that get recognized a lot mostly because it was done covertly , as most intelligence operations go . 
  before basescu the intelligence service was full of people loyal to the former president ( iliescu ) and the former nomenclature , most of them were actually still active from the time the communist securitate existed . 
  as president and head of the supreme council for the defense of the state ( csat ) he had a much more executive role in the changes and the cleanup of the intelligence services , he put people in charge that depending on who you ask will tell you they are professionals and competent ( basescu 's supporters ) or incompetent and they are there to do basescu 's orders ( basescu 's political enemies ) . 
  which of those is true , is not clear , i guess we 'll see when basecu is no longer president , but given that the intelligence services operate closely with friendly foreign agencies and are trusted by these allies to perform their tasks correctly , i would guess the people that really are leading these things do know what they are doing . 
  why cleaning up the internal intelligence service is important you ask ? 
  it 's simple , after the buff to the dna initially investigations were conducted with the technical help from the police ( wire taps , recording , etc ) and the police was and still very much is one of the most corrupt institutions there are and those that were being investigated had a tendency to find out they were investigated and evidence tended to `` get misplaced '' . 
  the dna seeing this , removed the police almost completely from investigations and started using the sri ( internal intelligence service ) to gather proof for their investigations . 
  after the cleanup of the intelligence services there were no more ( better said a lot less ) leaks about investigations and evidence stopped going missing . 
  after eu accession at the start of 2007 , the prime minister ( who was from a different party than basescu ) removed the party basescu came from from the government and with the help of the psd ( former communist party ) was able to survive as a minority government . 
  in exchange for this support there were an effort to have basescu removed from the presidency ( this is legally possible , but parliament can only suspend the president for a very short time , to remove him a referendum is required ) . 
  parliament suspended basescu in spring 2007 , but the referendum failed spectacularly and basescu was reinstated a month later . 
  during the 2007-2009 period there was a general institutional gridlock between the prime minister and parliament on one side and the president on the other . 
  due to the way the constitution is written the president has only very limited executive powers , but he does have a semi-veto power and the ability to protect the intelligence services from unwanted changes . 
  while this period basescu 's political enemies controlled both the government and the parliament but still had almost no control over the intelligence services and the justice system was already set up self sufficiently enough that to change it required passing new laws which were either vetoed by basescu or by the constitutional court . 
  so even though his enemies were in power , they did n't have enough power that they could do whatever they wanted . 
  at the end of 2008 there were elections for parliament and basescu was able to help his party gain the government and during the 2009-2012 years the dna&sri duo really started to hurt , politicians started to see that they were n't untouchable , the first real corruption cases were in this period . 
  in the spring of 2012 , due to the economic crises and the very unpopular austerity measures implemented basescu 's party lost the government and his political enemies were again in power . 
  they tried again to have him removed from the presidency , just like in 2007 , but again they failed to get the required number of votes in the referendum and basescu again returned as president . 
  what 's important to note from this is that during the month that basescu was suspended and the referendum happened his enemies tried changing any law they thought would help them win a referendum , but do to ** massive ** pressure and backlash from the eu and us they were unsuccessful . 
  since that moment in 2012 we 've been in a situation similar to the 2007-2009 period , his basescu political enemies control parliament and the government , but unable to remove basescu and unable to make significant changes to the intelligence services or the judicial system . 
  over the years the dna&sri duo matured and being protected for such a long time from political machinations , started working , at first not as effectively and slower , but as experience was gained the prosecutors gained more confidence and independence , hopefully enough independence that it will continue to work even when basescu is no longer president . 
  so in closing , it 's true that basescu does n't control the government , but he still has enough leverage to block attempts by his political enemies to make any significant changes to the justice system . 
  also , it 's worth noting that without the pressure from the eu and us , none of this would have happened . 
  i see that you still fail to understand what schengen is or why the gdp of anything has no impact on it . 
  you know what 's worse than being stupid ? 
  it 's being stupid and wrong , not only do you not know what schengen actually is , but you act like you have any clue about anything . 
  please do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up . 
   impossibly half-witted this , the man is an idiot , it 's best to ignore him . 
  nigal farage has nothing to do with schengen , since the uk is n't part of schengen either . 
  this is a great day !, 
  the first five threads were ok , but now it 's getting silly . 
  nobody gives a shit what you think , nobody asked you to reply to my post , get the fuck out . 
  only a year later than the ecb should have ... straight from the category of `` better late than never . '', 
  are n't you people sick of these threads ? 
  that fog thread takes the cake ... 
  yeah , i 'm sure that aa missile system and the people with the knowledge to use it dropped out of the sky on a sunny day . 
  who the fuck do you think you 're bullshitting ? 
  that missile system was provided by russia to the separatists and additionally trained separatists on how to use it at the very least , if not actually send some of their own men to do it . 
  actually you are not that wrong . 
  eu agricultural exports to russia represent 10 % of total eu agricultural exports , but those 10 % have actually a 42 % market share in russia . 
  so 42 % of all the food russians eat is from the eu . 
   believe that russia supporting terrorism ? 
  the russian government absolutely does support terrorism , regardless of your sob story . 
  the russian government is directly responsible for shooting down that plane and is responsible for arming terrorists and separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  just because you may have lost a friend in a bombing does not absolve you or the russian government of your guilt at this point . 
  the agricultural sector is only 2-3 % of the job market in the eu , of the products it produces most are n't even exported , being used inside the eu . 
  even if the 25 % of the exports that you said is correct ( hint : it is n't ) that would still only represent a fraction of the agricultural market which is only a very small part of the overall job market . 
  is that supposed to counter what i said ? 
  because it does n't seem like it does . 
  regardless , pretty interesting graph . 
  trade deals mean nothing if you do n't actually trade anything with those countries . 
  russia 's main export and import market is the eu , more importantly russia only exports natural resources and imports pretty much everything else , including a large part of its food . 
   what i think : not everywhere in romania is internet access . 
  where internet is available at all , high speed connections work , as those areas with intenet are highly populated ones . 
  you would be very wrong on that . 
  are you like ... on dial-up ? 
  holy shit !, 
  5 mbps !, 
  i do n't think i 've had so little since 2002 . 
  except for the fact that no romanian beef is actually exported to russia , this ban in reality does n't ban anything . 
  eu states can not negotiate bilateral trade agreements , such a thing would warp the common market . 
  all trade agreements must be negotiated as a block . 
  more like , it should be on the german constitutional court . 
  i 'm sorry , but this map is wildly inaccurate . 
  which proves what exactly ? 
  i think that says more about you than me . 
   i stand behind my decision shocking !, 
  like i expected some busybody mod to admit he was wrong . 
   if you want to complain do so . 
  i already have . 
   no you did n't , if you would have linked to exit clause or any similar proof i probably would have seen over the insulting language and let it be . 
  it was not in any way helpful or contributing to the discussion . 
  are you shitting me ? 
  pointing out that cancelling the contract is an exit clause out of the contract is not self evident ? 
   personal attacks that add nothing to the conversation will be removed . 
  it absolutely added to the conversation , he asked for an exit clause and i helpfully pointed it out to him . 
  you 're just bullshitting . 
  edit : since you 're so helpful , where do i report moderator abuse ? 
  oh great !, 
  it 's the busy body mod that 's been here all of 11 days talking like he knows anything . 
  edit : by the way which rule exactly did my post break ? 
  are you out of your fucking mind ? 
  you think your actions having consequences is a `` feudal '' concept ? 
  how about you go try to rob a bank and see if you 're as `` free to live '' as you want or if the police will make you suffer the consequences of your actions .
