  because the republic of moldova what ? 
   until the republic of moldova issue is settled , we should try to get along with russia . 
  which issue is that ? 
  perhaps you 've missed the fucking memo , but moldova is a different country than romania . 
  posting a map from rt.com ? 
  really ? 
  just from a quick look at it i can tell you that the % for romania is ** very ** wrong . 
  romania imports less than 20 % of its gas from russia . 
  uh ... it actually is . 
  an accurate and well deserved assessment . 
  the eu has been a fucking joke on this issue and then people in western capitals wonder why eastern european countries want to keep much closer ties with the us . 
  it 's easy to say russia is n't a threat when you 're sitting in berlin , london or rome suckling that gazprom teat . 
  if you did n't have insurance the cost you 'd have been charged would be close to $ 2000 dollars for a non-surgical treatment , that includes , x-ray , cast , doctor fees and others . 
  if your break requires surgery , like some leg breaks do and you did n't have health insurance than the cost you 'd be charged at the end would be around 25-30k dollars . 
  so yes , actually he is right when he says a broken leg can get you $ 20k , but only if you do n't have health insurance , because apparently if you ca n't afford insurance , you 'll be able to afford $ 25k for a leg break . 
  fuck logic !, 
  i do n't know why it would cost you so much , but even so i think it 's worth the money . 
  even if it does n't mean much for you , who knows how things turn out in the future and how it could help your kids . 
  if you have the money i think it 's worth it . 
   so israel is a terrorist state ? 
  some of the actions of the idf could be described as such , certainly . 
  although i do n't believe the motivation behind them is that of creating terror , unlike hamas . 
  hamas goes out of their way to provoke the idf and the results of that are plain to see . 
  i truly believe that no greater harm comes to the palestinian cause than from the actions of hamas . 
  they are really their own worst enemy . 
  firing rockets at civilians is terrorism , using suicide bombers is terrorism , using human shields is terrorism , firing missiles at planes thinking they are military when they are actually civilian is terrorism . 
  terrorists get no sympathy from me , no matter how just the cause . 
  perhaps ireland should reconsider their stance of siding with terrorism , not that israel is better , but there are no good guys here and pretending there are is a joke . 
  until such time as the palestinians stop all forms of terrorism i do n't think there 's a chance for peace . 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out . 
  no idea . 
  ah colbert at the white house correspondents dinner , that roast was absolutely hilarious . 
  i especially liked the line with the titanic and the hindenburg . 
  as if there 's any doubt that the rebels received at the very least training on this thing from russia , if not actually the entire piece of hardware . 
   i really would have liked it if stuff like this were released by a neutral third party , or atleast a west european inteligence agency , if they were n't spending all their time spying on themselves . 
  well it 's not that easy , you ca n't expect a foreign intelligence service to have better logistics in ukraine than the ukrainian intelligence service . 
  the sbu has the manpower and the infrastructure . 
  it 's not blind luck that only the sbu has been releasing these stuff , they are the only ones that can . 
  the ukrainian fight plane that was shot down , ukrainian government said the plane was shot by a russia fighter jet . 
  no , you 're just acting like this is the first guy you have n't voted for who got elected . 
  saying all the candidates were bad , is a cop out and all you 're doing is whining . 
  he was elected , he was elected just as much as cameron was elected as prime minister , as much as merkel was elected as chancellor . 
   i could n't have been clearer , this is n't an issue with how he was chosen , but who was chosen . 
  who was chosen was the same who who was nominated who is the same who who was elected . 
  all you 're argument comes down to `` but i really really do n't like this guy !, 
  perhaps you 're confused about the way democracy works . 
  you do n't get the best leaders possible , you get the leaders that get ** elected ** . 
   no one seems to have asked if he 's the right man for the job . 
  that 's because it does n't fucking matter . 
  is he the best guy for the job ? 
  probably not , but he 's the guy the epp put forward and the epp won the most votes in the election , that means juncker gets first chance at forming a commision . 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  please tell me that was a joke . 
  welcome to inelastic demand . 
  well 10 pounds = 12.5 euros , not that big of a difference . 
  if you can buy it in a coffee shop , it 's legal , at least compared to pretty much any other eu country . 
  it 's between 12-15 euros per gram here , depending on quality . 
  the cheapest is probably in the netherlands , since it 's legal there . 
  yes , lets put in people because they have a vagina , not because they are the best . 
  sounds great to me . 
  this is the first intelligent thing you 've said in this entire thread . 
   http://www.aecr.eu/media/aecramr-european-election-poll.pdf[1] you mean to tell me a poll made for the aecr backs the beliefs of the aecr ? 
  shocking news , i would n't have expected it . 
  also in other breaking news polls taken by the russian government support the policies of the russian government . 
  agreed !, 
  yes , i wonder how we 'll we ever survive if we ignore `` british concerns '' about having their cake and eating it too . 
  i 'm betting that there was n't much afrikaner freedom movement back during the apartheid era . 
  you 're just a minority that was used to getting its way and now that that stopped you 're all for independence . 
  sounds like bullshit to me . 
  i think this is the first thread you 've ever said something i actually agree with . 
  when you 'll post something worthy of a better reply , you 'll get it . 
  as long as you post deluded bullshit , all you 'll get is amused derision from me . 
  amusing ... keep lying to yourself , you 'll be in for a rude awakening . 
  like i said , if it comes to war i think russia will nuke china and china respond the same , so i do n't think that would solve anything . 
  a purchase is almost as unbelievable , this is n't just empty land we 're talking about , it 's a vault to an incredible amount of riches . 
  even if you get past the nationalist sentiment that russia has and you get to a point where such a transaction is in the realm of possibility , i just do n't think china can afford it . 
  yeah ... of all the things that are never going to happen , this has to be towards the very top . 
  the only way that russia is going to part with siberia is through a war , and it 's far more likely that russia would nuke every single chinese town with a population over 100 thousand before they let that happen . 
  at that point china wo n't need any additional space for it 's population , since 95 % of them will be dead anyway . 
  welcome to reddit , where the `` i disagree ! '', 
  button is a little blue arrow on the left side . 
  i 'm curious about which part of his conspiracy fueled delusions you take as well-meaning . 
  holy shit , you are either a troll or truly an idiot . 
   meanwhile the workers who make the brunt of the money circulating at their level suddenly have more disposable income to spend . 
  not when they get fired from their factory because demand for the goods they make collapsed you stupid fucking moron . 
  are you retarded ? 
  in a deflationary cycle companies do n't have the problem of meeting demand , because there is no demand to meet , since all the consumers will stop buying durable goods since they 'll think those goods will be cheaper next week or next month . 
  how is that so fucking hard to understand ? 
  because once the mentality that delaying your purchases gets you a better deal , reversing it is very hard . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  just ask the central bank of japan about the lost decade . 
   tl ; dr : a bit of delfation is good , except for employers and corporations ; who loose ( some , a bit of ) money and influence on it . 
  so they 'll go at extreme lengths to frighten people while we should aim for it if we can reach it reasonably . 
  the amount of stupid in this one phrase is staggering , / r/conspiracy is that way - , 
  deflation is the ** worst ** type of of economic cycle an economy can experience . 
  that is true for many reasons , but the most important one being that it imprints a buying attitude to consumers that feeds the spiral even more , making it even more severe . 
  image you 're a consumer that have x amount of money , today you can buy y number of products , if there is a deflation going on , you 'll not buy y number of products , because you 'll think if i wait until tomorrow i can buy y +1 products , or if i wait until next week i can buy 2y products for the same money . 
  now image this mentality applies for all the consumers in the market , demand for durable goods , like cars , phones , tvs , pcs , etc etc will collapse practically overnight . 
  what do you think the companies that manufacture those goods will do the next day ? 
  cut output , fire the excess workforce and lower the wages of whatever workforce they do have left , while at the same time lowering the price of the goods they sell hoping they might sell something at the lower price .
