   then why such hostility if we leave ? 
  what hostility ? 
  the fact that i want the uk out ? 
  i think the eu would function better without the uk . 
   you should n't want to try and force to keep in a member state that does n't want to be in . 
  nobody 's doing that , least of all me . 
  i 'm all for britain leaving the eu . 
   no i agree but common sense should prevail in the event of the uk deciding to go it alone and a free trade agreement is the most likely outcome to benefit all parties . 
  please see [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l8rtl/eu_threatens_to_fine_britain_70_million_a_month/clsj71t ) . 
  it has favorable trade agreements for the eu mostly . 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again , a free trade agreement is a treaty that regulates trade between states , but those regulations/quotas/norms are dictated by politics and leverage in negotiations . 
  a free trade agreement is ** certainly not ** a treaty about ** free ** trade . 
  additionally a fta with the eu does not give you access to the single market , which is what the uk actually wants and desires above all else . 
  norway and switzerland are two countries not in the eu that have actual access to the single market and for that access they not only have to follow almost every eu directive that relates to the single market , but they also have to pay a fee that 's almost equal to the fee they would pay if they were eu states . 
  if the eu took into account all national politics involved it would never get things done . 
  it 's an union of 28 of states , there 's always an election somewhere , releasing any report always hits at the wrong time for somebody . 
  the idea that the eu should have postponed the report just because it 's politically inconvenient for the uk is absolute bullshit . 
  the way those answers were collected makes the data very unreliable for this kind of information . 
  the guy/girl that did the survey does n't ask each member of the household independently all the questions , they only ask one person to provide the answers for everybody that has legal residence at that address . 
  as such i know my mother had me classed as orthodox in the survey when i 'm actually agnostic atheist and that 's the situation for most people in my age group . 
  additionally , people like to say they are orthodox out of tradition , not religious belief , this is especially true in cities . 
  most people there will say that are orthodox when asked , but if you ask when was the last time they went to church they 'll say `` they do n't know '' or `` a long time ago '' . 
   the fact there 'll be a fine of $ 250,000 per day when the deadline is reached , i 'd say yes the deadline matters . 
  in that case the uk better not be late with the payment . 
   anglosphere union plox . 
  yeah !, 
  the us will get right on that . 
   clearly they must have expected that a million people would immigrate to switzerland !, 
  they signed a treaty that says that people can come and live there if they want , if they did n't consider people actually doing just that they are either morons or lying . 
   no , it 's not . 
  the swiss culture is at risk of extinction . 
  do you listen to yourself ? 
   of course it is . 
  if you have that many immigrants you risk that they wo n't integrate into swiss culture , just because they wo n't have to . 
  and , all of a sudden , five decades later you have no more swiss culture left . 
  they should have thought of that before signing the treaties , regardless it 's a absurd statement to make . 
   they they will leave , we will all suffer from that . 
  the chance that you 'll suffer from the eu cutting off switzerland from the single market is an absurd notion , eu exports to switzerland are insignificant when compared to what 's inside the single market and the global market . 
  on a grande scale switzerland is unimportant and they are lucky to have the deal they do have , if they are stupid enough to break it they will reap what they sow . 
   i agree that it 's a tricky situation not really , it 's actually very simple . 
   but we have to acknowledge that switzerlands reasons are valid . 
  20 % is just too much . 
  no it 's not , but even if there was such a thing as `` too much '' it still would n't matter , because the treaties are already signed . 
  if switzerland wants to keep access to the single market it will suck it up , if it does n't they are free to implement immigration caps , but they ca n't have it both ways at the same time . 
   being just in the eea would solve that issue . 
  umm no , since being in the eea means you still have to conform to the free movement of people , which means you still wo n't be able to put immigration controls on eu migrants . 
  that 's what having access to the single market means . 
  just see the shitstorm switzerland is going through even though they have n't yet even put any caps in . 
  just the possibility of immigration caps cut of switzerland from erasmus and other programs and if the caps are actually applied switzerland 's access to the single market will be cut . 
  being in the eea is basically being in the eu except in a few things , but not having a vote on the things that do apply to you , which immigration is one of them . 
   back up your claim that leaders ca n't put up with a little political pressure via a certain attitude . 
  they do tend to be rather thick skinned . 
  merkel saying that the uk leaving is an acceptable solution if it keeps pushing for changes in free movement is exactly such a reaction . 
  or how about when she told cameron to get fucked with the whole juncker deal ? 
  those reactions were directly linked to cameron 's `` my way or the highway '' attitude . 
   the uk signed the lisbon treaty a couple of years ago , to suggest we are moving backwards just shows how short sighted you are . 
  that was 7 years ago , things have changed since then . 
   back up your estimation the uk is worst . 
  wait , so you disagree ? 
  you do n't think the uk is the worst offender in this ?!? 
   attitude does n't matter results matter , and cameron usually bends . 
  this is where you are absolutely wrong , attitude is important , the way you deal and treat your partners matters , more than one crises in history started from the attitudes of nations and people , it 's naive to think that changed . 
   sure , you can be as unified as you want if the uk leaves , but if you always kick out the slowest , you 'll have a tiny little unified state . 
  and there 's just no point in that . 
  again , the uk is n't the `` slowest '' . 
  slowest implies it 's moving along the same path , it 's not . 
  the uk is going the other direction and holding the rest back with it obstinance . 
   i suspect you 're just butthurt about ukip and assume their views on romanians are the majority view . 
  you assume wrong , the ukip 's views interest me none , i do n't live in britain as such their attitudes towards romanians holds no interest to me . 
  all i care is for the uk to be a fair partner in the eu and at this point i no longer believe that to be possible , which is why i think they should be encouraged to head for the exit , with all the good and bad consequences such a move entail . 
  norway is in the eea and it 's share to the eu budget is basically the same as it would be if norway would be an eu member , additionally norway has to implement most eu directives without having a vote on them when the eu adopts them , all that in exchange for access to the single market . 
  if the uk left the eu and stayed in the eea it would leave it in a worse position than it is in now , it will still have to listen to brussels and it will still have to pay it 's share to the eu budget and quite likely the uk rebate would disappear . 
  nobody even comes close to matching the uk 's flakiness , and while yes , different countries ask for special considerations on some issues they do n't go into negotiation with a `` my way or the highway '' attitude , at least not usually and they certainly do n't make it a habit . 
  at this point the uk 's attitude is predictable and expected . 
  you know what would surprise right now ? 
  if you actually tried to work together and find allies for a change in policy for once . 
   the eu is n't a unitary state , and if you demand total unity too soon , it will never get close . 
  it will get closer when the uk leaves do n't you worry your head about that . 
   so , in your opinion it is reasonable and in fact absurd . 
  or did someone hijack your account between the first two paragraphs ? 
  seems like a normal / u/llanita post from where i 'm sitting . 
  are n't you used to his `` logic '' by now ? 
  20 % or 200 % it makes no difference . 
  they signed a treaty , if they change the rules now , the eu will cut switzerland off , there simply is n't a viable political alternative . 
  the eu does n't care , nor should it care , why the swiss populace voted as they did , contract stipulations ca n't be overwritten just because the `` people '' what it . 
  you keep saying that , but i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
  the rest of the eu countries are sick and tired of the uk 's special snowflake attitude , do you get that ? 
   we want and need switzerland umm actually we do n't , it 's switzerland that needs access to the single market . 
   and the eu handwaves it in the interest of free trade without using the guillotine clause , then that 's what i mean by the eu being weak . 
  wow what ? 
  where in the world have you come up with that scenario ? 
  there is no reason the eu would ever do such a thing , it would basically signal the entire world that they can break their treaties with the eu without any consequence . 
  the chance of that happening is null . 
  how is the fact that the swiss populace might be suicidal a reflation on the eu ? 
  as / u/benthetraveler correctly points out swiss politicians have been working 24/7 to avoid the clusterfuck the voters caused . 
  this is because they realize what switzerland stands to lose if they let the idiots have their way . 
  just because they might not be able to prevent it , does n't mean anything , since the swiss populace already proved their incompetence on this matter when they voted for it . 
  if switzerland goes ahead with the immigration caps the guillotine clause will come into effect . 
  shocking !, 
  my comments in a thread about britain and the eu are actually about britain and the eu .
