  deflation cripples economies !, 
  a company can just as well run a factory at 30 or 40 % output just as well as at 100 % , the only difference being the number of end products it outputs and the number of salaries it pays . 
  if the general trend in a market is a delay in purchases , like in a deflationary spiral , if factories ca n't lower wages , they will fire people . 
  that is no corporate myth , made to trick you , it 's what will happen , more to the point it 's what ** has happened ** in the past when such deflationary cycles were encountered . 
  another outbreak of mad cow disease ? 
  seems likely , everyone knows how vigilant russian authorities are about such things . 
  i 've also asked myself that question , the answer i got was that they ca n't abandon so many people just like that . 
  while a large part of the population is russian , they only represent around 33 % of the total population . 
  another 33 % are ukrainians and the last 3rd are romanians ( moldovans ) . 
  it 's this last part that they ca n't leave , nor does moldova have the resources to simply move them . 
  it 's a innate self hate that many romanians have and the saddest thing is that this mentality has also propagated even to the newest generation . 
  hopefully we 'll get rid of it sooner rather than later . 
  i have no problem stating the joining the eu has been the best thing to happen to romania since 1918 bar none . 
  sure it also has bad parts , but the good things outweigh them by such a large margin it 's difficult for a non-romanian to understand or believe it . 
  what he means is that the last guy that made a deal with russia/ussr was also born in austria . 
  what to try to guess the name ? 
  that 's pretty bullshit . 
  i know it makes for a good story , but the logistics just were n't there . 
  exactly , using cavalry based armies on the wide open fields of russia and ukraine is one thing , using those armies to take fortified cities in the forests and mountains of central europe is quite another . 
  ignore him , chodechugging is a very sad and lonely individual . 
  be assured that his views are , thankfully , extremely rare . 
  he 's under the impression that he holds some truth that everyone else fails to understand . 
  not that i want to nitpick or be offtopic , but the mongols were by no means close to achieving such a thing . 
  the high density of castles and fortified cities in central and western europe at the time pretty much ensured that the mongols would n't get much further than they did . 
  while spain 's economic problems were n't exactly caused by the euro , they sure as hell were amplified by it . 
   it still has influence . 
  for example , it can still borrow money and default on those loans . 
  i would be fascinated to find out how exactly you think that will impact the pound . 
  something tells me , it 's going to be hilarious . 
  i see you still fail yo grasp even the most basic understanding of economics , i 'm done with you . 
  all you 're argument comes down to is that , it would be mean of us to do anything except what you say . 
   is it that you do n't think it will be enough time ? 
  no , that 's not it at all . 
  i just do n't think you can objectively judge the economic state of a nation , before it 's an actual independent nation . 
  how can you judge the stability of the currency before the currency is in circulation ? 
  how can you judge the long term budget balance before a nation even has a budget ? 
  no , i did n't forget , i just do n't think it matters , nor do i think it should matter . 
   spain has already made clear that it recognises the distinction between unilateral and bi-lateral secession while that is true , i do n't read into it as much as you , apparently , do . 
  all i take from that is that spain will not veto scotland 's accession to the eu through the normal process . 
  i do n't think spain , nor other countries in the eu , are all that eager to create a backdoor into the accession process . 
  that 's just my feeling on it . 
  are you out of your mind ? 
  in what world do you think spain will agree to any treaty change that will give secessionist territories easy access to the eu ? 
  wait until you have proof you actually have a stable economy , a balanced budget and a stable currency . 
  unless you think scotland should keep the pound even though they wo n't have any power over it ? 
  or should they join the euro ? 
   you have to give investors long-term security about the legal framework they 'll be operating in . 
  oh , so you think the eu should just give scotland a free pass because the change its people voted for might have unsee consequences ? 
  that 's exactly why i 'm against granting scotland automembership into the eu . 
  if scotland is a viable independent country it should have no problem joining the eu the old fashioned way , they should n't need exceptions , nor should they be granted any . 
  it still will be around 80 % debt to gdp , which is more than they should , since the uk as a whole has more than it should . 
  how is that hard to understand ? 
  they could negotiate before independence , but it would be ill advised to do so . 
  scotland 's economic situation post independence is not nearly as clear cut as you might think . 
  i think both the eu and scotland would be wise to wait a year or two post independence before joining the eu . 
  they will also own a large part of uk debt , more so in % of gdp than they should . 
   doing it the strictly legal route , no matter how much useless administration and organisational disruption it will cause . 
  if by that you mean the ** only ** legal way , than yes i must insist on it . 
  that wo n't be possible since it 's impossible to know the financial situation of an independent scotland before it 's actually independent . 
  that 's not the way it works at all . 
  if scotland declares independence , at the moment of independence they will be outside the eu and will have to negotiate entry to the eu , if that is what they want , just like any other country . 
  seems like a monument to greed , i do n't get the hype at all . 
  a power where you can vote for a president , but only using it to rubber stamp a council decision is no power at all . 
   the council is functionally left with no choice . 
  no , the council has the same number of choices as before , they can still pick who they want , it 's just that that person will probably not have enough support in parliament to pass a confirmation vote . 
   in theory the council are supposed to `` take note '' of the ep no , the council is supposed to take note of ep election results , it 's fully within the ep right to reject any nominee it does n't like . 
   that this is a ( successful ) power grab is too far from the mark . 
  even if i were to agree with that interpretation , that does not make it a bad thing . 
  this is the way parliaments have grabbed power from ruling monarch in europe for centuries , why should this one be any different ? 
   no , but it 's supposed to be a consensual organisation . 
  that 's what the uk gets told every time we do n't go along with the french-german axis . 
  which one ? 
  when was the last time you saw a parliament be consensual about anything ? 
  if you mean the council , than ideally yes , but certainly that is n't nor should it be required . 
   but the uk will respond to that by leaving , and we can take our membership fees with us . 
  well get the fuck out than already , you 've been crying and warning about this for years . 
  make up your damn mind already . 
   we still have friends in the rest of the world . 
  i 've been talking with a lot of friends in the conservative party over the last couple of days , and the eu 's behaviour here has swung a great many of them who were in the `` in but reform '' position to becoming `` better off out '' . 
  i think the next tory leader after cameron will be a proper eurosceptic . 
  like i said , if the uk wants to leave , just do it , but stop your moaning . 
   so the ep is effectively conducting a power grab by refusing to compromise . 
  so by your opinion the ep should only use its power when it suits the council ? 
  there is nothing anywhere that says the ep has to compromise with the council on anything . 
   by all accounts merkel opposed the principle , but then was bounced into supporting him by the german press wanting to stand up to cameron . 
  merkel had multiple chances to stop the lead candidate process long before it was finished , she did n't . 
  she ca n't cry now about it . 
  of course she 'll catch hell from the media if she backed out now . 
   it 's supposed to be a joint consensus decision by the council and the parliament . 
  but the parliament is digging its heels in and refusing to have anyone else other than their man . 
  that 's not consensus , that 's a power grab . 
  the council can nominate who they want , just like the ep can choose to reject any nominee they do n't like and they decided that anyone but juncker will be rejected . 
  merkel & co decided that they do n't want to go into an institutional crises with the ep , especially since they 'd probably lose it anyway . 
  because at this point i do n't believe that any one country deciding to leave would make the eu collapse , least of all the uk . 
  the eu will adjust and continue with 27 members . 
  bump in the road ? 
  sure . 
  falling of a cliff ? 
  absolutely not . 
  even after it 's been explained to you several times you still fail to understand .
