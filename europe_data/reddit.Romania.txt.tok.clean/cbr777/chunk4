  the uk will not simply get a fta with `` free trade of goods and services '' , the eu would at that point have no economic reason to do it and even more importantly , politics would dictate that brussels take a very hard stance on the uk . 
  even for a simple fta the uk would have to make concessions , big ones , without a doubt . 
  if the uk will want actual access to the single market , like switzerland or norway have , than at that point it 's almost certain you 'll have to accept a norway type solution and be ruled by fax . 
  the switzerland model is looked on as overtly complex and while switzerland can keep it as a legacy issue , no new country will be given such option . 
   then , of course , the uk could sign it 's own free trade agreements elsewhere , without the protectionist states like france constantly undermining us . 
  that would be a sizable economic benefit . 
  you seem to think fta are some magical tool , they are n't . 
  hell marocco has an fta with the eu if i remember correctly . 
  i 'm pretty sure you think an fta gives you access to the single market , this is factually false . 
  the damage to the uks economy by losing access to the single market will be significant . 
  i 'm sorry but are you under the impression that simply replacing access to the single market with a fta would prevent economic damage to uk economy ? 
  the single market is ** a lot ** more than just a mutual fta and uk leaving would cause huge damage to its economy , not to mention that it would guarantee that financial regulation from brussels would force major financial firms relocate part/most of their operations in an eu country . 
  exactly . 
  if the uk breaks the fundamental rules of the single market it will get thrown out simply because the eu can not afford to let such a precedent be created . 
  if the eu would buckle to the blackmail and give the uk what it wanted at that point all other eu countries will go ahead and pick and choose which parts of the eu they want to keep , and rightly so . 
  do not delude yourself that being `` 3rd largest economy '' will mean anything , if you cross the red line you 'll get thrown out . 
   that 's why i think regardless of eu populist opinion a renegotiation will take place eventually . 
  no , because at that point there wo n't be an eu anymore , it will be de facto dissolved . 
  if he wants to get thrown out of the eu he could try that , but i already said that . 
   it 's pretty apparent and only becoming more common . 
  hmm ... 
  i wonder if that somehow correlates with the uk 's `` special snowflake '' attitude it has towards the eu . 
  holy shit at least try to read what he wrote before replying like a stereotypical brit . 
   it is n't impossible that there can be a deal of some sorts . 
  on `` free movement '' or any of the four pillars of the single market it is impossible and if the uk tries to blackmail the rest it could find itself escorted out of the eu in all but name . 
   why should n't the uk push to change it . 
  because it makes you look like fucking assholes , i thought that are pretty obvious . 
  the uk will never be allowed such an opt-out no matter how much it screams for it so either leave the eu or shut up about it , it 's not up for discussion . 
  the rest of the eu nations are not going to indulge the uk to even be seen like negotiating on it , because that very act would undermine the union . 
   presumably the same universe that granted multiple nations an opt-out of the eurozone , just as much a core ideology of the eu as free movement . 
  you were granted that before the eurozone actually existed , when it was just adopted , nor is the ez has much of a `` core '' to the eu as the freedom of movement . 
   i do n't think it will happen though , i 'm not naive , the rest of the eu has no reason to grant the uk a renegotiation . 
  first reasoned thing you 've said in this thread . 
  you received them when those policies were adopted , `` free movement '' is not a new policy and more importantly you already accepted it , nor are any of those opt-outs as important in scope as being given an opt-out on one of the fundamental bases of the eu . 
   so does this mean we should remove all opt-outs that many nations have in the eu as it 's either all or nothing with no in-between or negotiation ? 
  in generally i 'm against all opt-outs , however that does not mean that in some situations one might not be the right course of action . 
  as long as the opt-out is limited in scope and has a good reasoning behind it . 
  all the current opt-outs , with the exception of the euro one , are pretty minor in the grand scheme of things and do n't really have an impact on the eu as a whole . 
  more importantly opt-outs can only be granted when a new law is adopted , the uk already accepted `` free movement '' as part of the eu , it ca n't and will not be granted an opt-out now . 
  the only way the uk will get rid of `` free movement '' is by leaving the eu . 
  how exactly do you see the other 27 members of the eu granting the uk such a concession ? 
  in what universe do you ever see that happening ? 
   this is false moralism you 're making up on your own . 
  wow ... what does that even mean ? 
  stop trying to use fancy words , you 're only embarrassing yourself without actually saying anything . 
   a union is not chiseled in stone , it is continually negotiated and re-negotiated . 
  the four pillars of the eu will not be negotiated , they only work as a package deal , trying to remove one of them will lead to the destruction of the eu . 
   do you understand the fucking difference ? 
  what do you think you show by copying my lines ? 
  you 're one sad little child . 
   why not ? 
  are you for real ? 
  are you trolling because i really ca n't tell this time . 
  in the unlikely case that you really do n't understand why you ca n't just pick and choose which parts of the eu you get to keep , i 'll just point out that the eu is formed of 28 member states . 
  each of them wants and needs different parts of the eu treaties . 
  the uk will ** never ** be allowed to remove the freedom of movement because the four pillars of the eu come as a package . 
  each member state likes some things and really dislikes others , but they accept those things they dislike because they consider that the positives of the things they like outweigh the negatives of the things they do n't like . 
  the uk really likes the common market , but does n't like free movement , if the uk actually tried to remove free movement some other eu members might very well remove the uk from the common market . 
  you only keep the parts you like only as long as the other eu members allow you to keep it , as such no nation will ever be allowed to pick and choose which parts of the eu it keeps . 
  it can either accept the entire thing , both the good and the bad , or none at all . 
  you are free to opt out of the eu anytime you want , ** but ** you are not free to opt out of some parts of the eu you do n't like while keeping the ones you do like . 
  so either get the fuck out of the eu or stop whining . 
  do you understand the fucking difference ? 
  you fail to see what 's so wrong for a country to opt out of the parts it does n't like and keeping only those that it likes ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  how delusional can you be that you 'd think `` free movement of people '' can be negotiated away ? 
  cameron would need to convince the rest of 27 eu nations and force through a treaty change for that to be possible . 
  there is no way that 's going to happen . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  why should n't the state finance such a service ? 
  from personal experience i can say that internet quality in italy is terrible , clearly the free market has n't worked . 
  a state run service that 's not concerned with profit margins only needs to make up the costs of running the service and that can be done with selling ads and so forth , all the while giving both italians and the millions of visitors to italy a much better internet connection and force isps to actually invest in their infrastructure if they want to stay competitive . 
  holy shit you just went full retard with that relativism and whataboutisms . 
  it 's clear you do n't actually have a leg to stand on , all i can say is that / r/conspiracy is that --  way . 
   as a romanian i would have expected you to understand nuace and propaganda a little better than you currently do . 
  i can and clearly better than you , i also know that while you have a right to your opinion , you do n't have a right to your own facts , which is exactly what you 're doing . 
  you 're rewriting history with your own made up facts to fit with your clearly warped and deluded narrative . 
  if i did n't know you 're actually this stupid , i 'd have classed you as a troll . 
  i 'm done with you , res tagged as retard . 
  in that case maybe you should stop thinking with you ass and start using your head . 
  what you 're doing is nothing more than historical revisionism and the only thing it proves is that you 're ignorant of the subject matter with no ability for critical thinking . 
  there was no agreement to such a thing , even gorbachev admitted that no such promise was ever made , let alone an actual agreement written and signed . 
  stop talking out of your ass . 
  this from the guy that just invaded a neighboring nation ? 
  is this some kind of a joke ? 
  you are n't some special snowflake and certainly no country is filled with special snowflakes that statistics ca n't predict results within a small margin of error . 
  a sample of 2000 people is more than enough to have a relevant result , they make polls on less than that with an error of less than 3 % . 
  in 2013 , when the commision , the council and the european parliament agreed to the change in measurement from esa 95 to esa 2010 . 
  / u/brandmon has an excellent post about this [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2k4uas/eu_makes_britain_pay_for_recovery_demand_for_an/clidu6b ) . 
  norway 's `` veto '' is a myth , it does exist in theory , but norway never actually used it for any consequence and with good reason , they 'll be fucked if they do . 
  that postal directive or whatever bullshit that is ( like who gives a fuck about postal directives ?!?! ), 
  even if it 's true it shows just how unimportant that veto is , norway was only not afraid of using it on a unimportant directive nobody cares about . 
  please stop giving noname blog posts as proof of anything ... ever again . 
  the eu has always demanded a piece of the pie , perhaps you should check your eu treaties . 
  each country gives a % of gdp to the eu , since uk had a growth of gdp , that number also went up . 
  the % of gdp did n't . 
  as has been pointed out greece is also one of the countries that end up paying more to the eu and that 's because their numbers are actually better than they were estimated , if the numbers were relative to everybody else in the eu that would n't have been the case , since greece is in the shitter economically . 
   maybe the ft has got this story wrong . 
  i 'm going to be cynical and say that i doubt that was a mistake , blaming the ez for britain having to pay more is a much better narrative than saying `` our economy is doing better than expected , as such the share of the money we have to send to the eu also went up . '', 
  so what ?
