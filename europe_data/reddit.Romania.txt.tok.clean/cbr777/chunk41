   what interests you about europe ? 
  it 's history , culture and food . 
   what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe [ 3 ] ? 
  my least favorite thing about / r/europe is the attitude of the current moderator team that confuses their opinions on matters with the rules of the sub and as such moderating in a biased and flawed manner . 
  my favorite thing about this sub , is that even after being a default it actually manages to represent the very many opinions of people in real life . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i 've not been a moderator on reddit before , but i have been a moderator on others forums a long time ago . 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  because not only do i think the current moderator team is undermanned , but i also think the current moderator team is n't that good , or at least the moderators that are the most active . 
  the current moderator team has not been able to show it can actually moderate in a fair and unbiased fashion , something that the people in the sub have noticed to a great degree and is actually the root cause of many of the problems . 
  currently the users simply do n't trust the moderator team and any and all moderating decisions are scrutinized with a very skeptical view , simply because of the lack of trust . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i think i would make a very good moderator , because i can separate my personal opinions from my moderating . 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  some experince with statistics , but no to the rest . 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  the immigration megathread was a complete clusterfuck from beginning to end . 
  i do n't know what exactly possessed the mods of this sub to start it because it was an obvious disaster from the get go . 
  i do n't know if it was actually meant to be a good faith try at keeping the immigration threads in one place or if it was an attempt at banning the topic without actually saying so . 
  i certainly hope it 's the former , but somewhat expect it 's the latter , regardless the people on this sub saw right through it for what it was , pure censorship . 
   what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i 'm a very direct person , sometimes a bit too direct and i end up saying things a bit too bluntly . 
   would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  a hundred duck sized horses . 
   what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why there 's a very funny video on youtube that has the answer i think . 
  earn what ? 
  where exactly ? 
  there are countries in the eu with unemployment north of 20 % and many more with 10 % , where are these jobs that the immigrants are supposed to take ? 
   i disagree , germany has done all it can , it is just not the right country to lead europe , it is too resented in a continent with long memories . 
  i do n't believe that , i think if germany actually showed real leadership the rest would follow , but all we 're getting from germany is a big black hole of leadership . 
   that responsibility imo should be with france or perhaps britain , poland i think is also a candidate in the future . 
  the problem with that is , germany refuses to follow either . 
  it wants what it wants and does n't understand there are other countries and people in the eu . 
   mmmm , i do n't quite see it that way , i agree with many of the points you make but i think merkel was constrained by her reality , the idea of german leadership is not popular among europeans . 
  i do n't think so . 
  what 's unpopular is this leading by diktat that she imposed on greece . 
  that 's not leadership , what brave political stance has merkel taken ? 
  absolutely none , she could n't have been more of an `` unleader '' if she tried . 
   merkel has to both lead and appear not to be leading . 
  and has been failing miserably at both . 
  the resurgence of american influence in europe , in eastern europe especially , is an obvious failure of the eu as a whole and of merkel in particular . 
  germany under merkel 's leadership has failed at every step of the way in it 's eu leadership . 
  germany has been more concerned about people and countries that are n't in the eu than those in the eu . 
  on the matter of greece , instead of adopting the much needed fiscal policies , that would correct the deep flaws in the eurozone , merkel buried her head in the sand and pretended she does n't understand what 's going on . 
  she orders the greek people into decades of austerity to repay mountains of debt just so she can protect germany 's aged population and their saving accounts . 
  at the same time she cries about solidarity in the immigrant crises and wonder why nobody wants to help germany deal with it . 
  on the matter of russia , one can make the argument that merkel 's mistakes were actually bigger than on the greek matter . 
  even though the entire ukraine issue started because the eu wanted ukraine to join , germany washed its hands of the whole thing when things went sideways . 
  her answer to russian invasions was to send stern worded letters to moscow . 
  seeing all of this , of course eastern european countries went to the us . 
  the eu under germany 's leadership has been running around like a headless chicken , it simply ca n't be trusted to protect the interests of its ee members . 
  i do n't think there 's been a politician as toxic to the unity of the eu more than merkel . 
  she has failed at every single turn . 
  when the history books will be written about this period in 25 years , i have no doubt nobody will receive as much blame than her , for her unwillingness to put aside local politics at the expense of the eu and simply for her incompetence as the leader of the biggest and most powerful eu country . 
   my textbook just calls it the great schism . 
  i think you might want to get a new textbook if that 's the case . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  [ meta meta ] 5 out of last 5 metathreads have been about the immigration threads . 
  in a unrelated , but hardly surprising news this thread has been opened by a redditor of 1 month , where are all the guys that complain about brigading and gave examples of the number of comments made by new accounts ? 
  using the same logic is this proof of brigading also and if not why not ? 
  i think you 're asking about the western schism , not the great schism , that one happened about 350 years earlier . 
   need 3 salaries for 1-2 weeks that is really not true . 
   how can romanians , serbians etc come to greece where the cost of living is much bigger and your salaries smaller ? 
  i would n't say that prices in greece are that much bigger than in romania , do n't get me wrong , they are bigger , but it 's nowhere near as big of a difference as you 're making it out to be . 
  yes , salaries on average are smaller , however romanians do n't work in romania and live in greece , they live in romania and go on vacation in greece . 
  a week or two of higher prices wo n't kill you if you budget for it and we do . 
   but for a romanian , latvian , serbian etc is probably too expensive actually not , as a holidaying location greece is the second cheapest option for a romanian , bulgaria being the absolute cheapest . 
  vacationing on the romanian seaside will actually cost more on a per day basis than it costs in greece . 
  hotel rooms are incredibly expensive in romania . 
   unless if only the rich guys are comming no , the rich guys go to the riviera , tahiti , ibitza , etc etc. 
  you wo n't find rich romanians vacationing in greece , except maybe in some luxury 5 star resort . 
  greece gets the romanian middle class and even the sub middle class as clients . 
   can the travel agencies do that without losing money ??? 
  absolutely . 
  travel agencies even specialize in the sub middle class that i said before . 
  people that could n't afford a vacation in greece by themselves , go in organized groups and because of that and group discounts everything ends up cheaper . 
  romanians that do have a little more money , go independently . 
  while it costs more , there are obvious advantages . 
  to be honest , considering the very high number of romanians that go on summer holiday in greece i have no doubt that greece got a lot more than 110 million from romania these last 2 months . 
  when exactly are you going to be asking for new moderators , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  except these guys were on the border , so they at least knew where it was . 
  after spending money on men , training and equipment to satisfy schengen requirements and than countries like germany or netherlands fucking us over because local politics , you want romania to just let these guys pass through ? 
  i can already see the articles in the western press how clearly romania is n't ready for schengen because if these guys can just walk through , so could anyone else , so clearly romania is n't ready to be let into schengen . 
  western european countries are fucking experts at moving the goal posts when it suites them . 
  they could save europe by not coming over . 
  what an absurd article . 
  no , giving implies you actually gave it , germany did not have the political will to give greece anything , that 's why everybody has to go through this dog and pony show , but that also means you do n't get to claim you gave them anything . 
  ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  until such time as germany writes off that money and forgives the debt , there was no giving involved . 
   how convinced are you that greece will be able to pay back the money ? 
  i 'm not convinced at all , in fact i know they wo n't . 
  nice b8 m8 i r8 8/8, 
  that 's a 10 point plan to do nothing except take in wave after wave of immigrants , honestly i want the 3 minutes i wasted on reading this trash `` plan '' back . 
   we gave 86 billion $ to greece just days ago . 
  no , you did n't ** give ** greece anything , you ** loaned ** it money . 
  pretty sure it 's not nearly as hard , as it 's for me to take you seriously , when you think your opinions are facts . 
  the idea that japan is xenophobic is your opinion , not a fact , please stop thinking your opinions are law . 
   are you really defending xenophobia ?
