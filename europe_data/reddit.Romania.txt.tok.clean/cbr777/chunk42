  no , i 'm defending their right to not match whatever social norm you decide to fancy this week . 
  you 're imposing your pc brainwashed morality on somebody that is from a completely different culture . 
  no , i did not misunderstand him , since he makes his views quite clear ...  the people who object to accepting refugees now are the same people who were die-hard communists and strong believers in their governments in eastern europe/germany . 
  this is just as wrong as what he said and only something that somebody that has no fucking clue about anything would say . 
   the small minded cowards and those that had something to lose . 
  holy shit i have n't seen a bullshit generalization of this magnitude in years . 
  i 'm willing to actually bet money you have no fucking clue of anything you speak , yet feel you can actually insult the populations of literally entire countries because they might not agree with your bullshit politics of the day . 
  normally i would tell you to go fuck yourself , but judging by your attitude and the massive stick you have shoved up your ass , clearly somebody else already did . 
   japan is often seen as being overly homogenous and xenophobic , which may very well be in part due to strong nationalism . 
  and who are you to say that 's bad or not ? 
  japan is the way japanese want it and the idea that you can judge them as being wrong is beyond arrogant . 
  dear slovak state , i am a nigerian prince with a fortune of billions , bad people are trying to steal it from me , if you help me move my money to your country , i 'll pay you 5 % of it . 
  i hope to hear from you about this chance , thank you my friend nigerian prince, 
  real quality content you got there . 
   interesting video explaining better than i can about recent russian military structural changes this is an amazing video which i have n't seen . 
  thank you . 
  no , actually he does n't , because he has no idea how many immigrants i know or knows practically anything about me , i on the other hand made fun of something he said . 
  try to keep up . 
   and your response was totally an appropriate retort to my original statement yes , i agree , it actually was . 
  thank you for noticing !, 
   absolutely , but that 's only the case if they want to win , which i 'm not so certain of . 
  except you have to consider that there was a point last year when the ukr army had almost completely recaptured east ukraine , at that point russia needed results , and fast , because it could n't politically afford to let the pro-russian separatists be defeated . 
  excellent logic , a gem of debating virtue , second only to your first post . 
   content than just news articles . 
  yea ... generally shit content . 
  like the famous xxx of europe threads , where an entire month every time i looked at the front page there was some shit thread about some random object in every single country . 
   why would they send the best of the best when they 're unable to support them with everything they have ? 
  because sending in badly trained conscripts would n't get you any results , only dead bodies . 
  sending the best , even if badly supplies , at least opens the possibility of winning , or at least stopping the enemy from advancing , especially if the enemy force are also badly supplied and equipped . 
  the new accounts are just people that are ban evading or posting from throwaways to avoid a ban on their main accounts , in no way that actually implies brigades , but as i already mentioned this term has lost absolutely all meaning . 
  currently it 's used to explain how many people have opinions somebody does n't agree with . 
  you ca n't handle that maybe , just maybe , your opinion is the unpopular one , so clearly everybody else is vote manipulating . 
  it 's so transparent it 's embarrassing . 
  unlike op who 's a `` redditor for 5 months '' yet feels he has a clue about brigades . 
   bullying ai n't gon na work you know that words actually have definitions , they do n't mean whatever you want them to mean in any given context . 
   and we all know full well what is going on . 
  no , quite clearly you have no fucking idea what is going on . 
  you have absolutely no proof of anything , but you ** believe ** you 're right . 
  people that have no proof , but believe they are right are almost certainly always wrong and you 're not the exception . 
  in spite of the obvious popularity of immigration threads , with high vote counts on all sides , you 're coming out with this conspiracy that every single thread is brigaded , a term that has basically lost all meaning , even though this sub has over 400k subs and pretty much any actual brigade would be nothing more than pissing in an ocean . 
  i think it 's pretty clear that the best contribution you can make to this sub right now is to never post here ever again . 
   nonetheless - the greeks got money no , actually what they got is a ** loan ** . 
  try to notice the difference . 
  greece does n't need more loans , it already has more than enough debt than it can pay , what it actually needs is fiscal transfers . 
   * if you think of yourself as being a part of europe your border is south of sicily . 
  or actually south of lampedusa . 
  except for greeks , they are lazy and only evade taxes , fuck them right ? 
  where was this solidarity when greece needed help ? 
  solidarity only when it suits you is n't solidarity . 
  ok ... clearly you have multiple issues , and only one of them is being unable to tell figurative speech from literal one . 
  i think we 're done here . 
  that 's ... a methaphore , you do understand that right ? 
  does it mean i think germany will be literally killed , whatever that means , by this ? 
  however i do consider this behavior reckless and bad , as such i see the refusal of other countries to implement similar measures as not agreeing to a `` suicide pact '' , not that they will be literally killed , seeing as such a thing is not really possible for a country . 
  i 'll use smaller words for you next time . 
  fair point . 
   you think not distributing refugees is killing germany ? 
  where did i ever say that ? 
  you 're arguing against made up statements , please stop . 
  yeah , but in chechnya they sent every poor unfortunate soul to fight , this time they tried doing it on the down low , so i 'd have thought they 'd send the best of the best for operational security and to keep casualties low . 
  germany can take as many as it wants , its the crying that others are n't following its suicide pact that is annoying . 
  like i said i 'm againt a sharing system in this case for many reasons . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11821822/germany-drops-eu-rules-to-allow-in-syrian-refugees.html ) announcement . 
  that 's actually more dead and injured on the russian side than i thought , i guess their elite units are n't that elite . 
  so your argument is that someone is racist because you think they are racist , did i get that right ? 
  this is excellent news !, 
  hopefully the normalization of relations will happen soon , because serbia wo n't be able to move forward in eu accession until this is resolved . 
  people are saying things i do n't like , they must be deleted !, 
  when you reply to my post you are talking to me , if you want to talk to the mods take it to modmail . 
  listen redditor for 25 days , i 've been here a whole lot longer than you , you do n't get to tell me on what topics i can comment on , got it ? 
   so your problem is that others like debating this issue and you do n't ? 
  well ... tough fucking luck . 
  the single biggest issue in current european politics takes a lot of screen space ? 
  color me shocked . 
  the immigrants that are coming do n't want to be `` shared '' they want to get to the milk and honey countries like germany and sweden . 
  that said , no i do n't support such a system , not only because i think it 's defective and unusable , but also because it condones reckless behavior by others , case in point the recent announcement by germany that it will let in pretty much everybody from syria . 
   i know plenty of second generation immigrants that are incredibly beneficial to society and the economy . 
  oh you know `` plenty '' ? 
  well that 's it folks , problem solved , / u/jwalwyn knows plenty second generation immigrants and he says there 's no problem . 
  so your problem is that others like debating this issue and you do n't ? 
  well ... tough fucking luck . 
   i think that economical sanctions are wiser and more effective you mean the sanctions that she was actually against and had to be dragged kicking and screaming for ? 
  those sanctions were n't implemented because merkel argued for them , they were implemented in spite of her . 
  he did not make your point , he outright countered it . 
  you said that the us sold ukraine out , this is blatantly false . 
  if anyone sold ukr out it was germany and france . 
  your idea that us influence in ee will erode because people will realize that the us sold ukraine out is clearly wishful thinking . 
  so in a debate about right wing extremism vs islamic extremism asking about isis is whataboutism ? 
  are you out of your mind ? 
  the only one here that is wrong is you with your nonsense idea that nk and china are `` right wing '' because apparently words now have whatever meaning suits us at the time of speaking . 
  i 'm done with you . 
  ignored . 
  nationalism has never been a left-right issue ever , there have been as many left nationalists as there have been right ones . 
  you 're attempt at whataboutism is beyond stupid and i 'm not going to indulge it with a reply any more . 
   you also need to include north korea , china and russia on the right wing side . 
  rofl , china and nk on the right wing ? 
  pass the joint mate , that must be some really good shit . 
   once it becomes clear , that the us threw ukraine under the bus as willingly as western europe , that might change . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  because the situation as you describe is far from obvious .
