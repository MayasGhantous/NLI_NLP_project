  we do have that sweet white bread you 're talking about and it 's called toasted bread , but it 's by no means the only white bread nor the most popular by far . 
  many people also do n't like it since it 's sweet . 
  why ca n't you deposit the money in the account you want simply by going to the bank and telling them your iban code . 
  there might be some fees involved in this , i 'm not sure , but you should be able to transfer the money . 
  checks do n't exist in europe anymore , some parts never had them and others did away with them long ago . 
  it boggles my mind the the us still uses such antiquated methods of money transfer . 
  bring cash , do n't count on atms working . 
  other than that have fun . 
  umm no , mixing gender nouns is very rare and sounds completely off . 
  it 's simply not a mistake one does easily and when it does occur you realize it right away and correct it . 
  britain might be an island , but it 's not a continent , so yes , british people are european . 
  oslow ? 
  kek, 
  going to be there at the beginning of july . 
  i do n't consider turks and turkey to be european . 
  while i agree that there are european cultural influences in western turkey , that is all they are . 
  berlin is the much cheaper option , so unless you 're made out of money i 'd strongly recommend it . 
  london is just so incredibly overpriced . 
  also you can do just find with only speaking english in berlin , the city is full of foreigners anyway , you wo n't have problems language wise . 
   1 ) can spanish/uk inmigration turn me back at the airport ? 
  no , they ca n't . 
  since you have portuguese citizenship you 're fully entitled to enter spain as you wish , they can not stop you . 
   2 ) i 'm aware that if i live in an eu country other than portugal , they have to right to deport me to portugal if i commit a crime or something . 
  but is there any freaky reason they might deport me to venezuela instead ?? 
  ( excluding a situation where i lose my portuguese citizenship which i 'll ask about in the next question ) i do n't think so , at least not unless you 're arrested based on an international arrest warrant issued by venezuela . 
   3 ) i have portuguese citizenship through descent . 
  my father and his parents were born in portugal/full portuguese citizens . 
  is there any way portugal could also deport me to venezuela ? 
  that depends on portuguese legislation , but i really doubt it . 
  most countries try to avoid having to deport their own citizens , it sets bad precedents . 
  the only way for it to happen is if you 're arrested on an international warrant issued by venezuela . 
  you have portuguese citizenship , ** it 's your right to be there ** , they ca n't just kick you out . 
   4 ) and is there any way portugal could revoke my citizenship even though i got it through descent ? 
  a quick google search indicated to me that there is no way for portugal to revoke citizenship . 
  i 'm guessing that the only way you can lose your portuguese citizenship is by voluntarily giving it up . 
  i 've just looked into it and it 's legal to buy in romania . 
  a quick google search showed that it costs about 70 euro cents for a bag of 30g of boric acid . 
  greece hands down . 
  if you 're looking to get punched in the face i suppose you can do that . 
  well it 's not guaranteed that it 's going to happen , just something to watch out for . 
  well i do n't know about the other cities , but for bucharest the only thing you really have to watch out for are the taxi drivers . 
  they will try to cheat you and ask for more money when they find out you 're a foreigner . 
  i would still wait a bit on that . 
  yes the exchange rate is good now , but the ecb will probably start qe next week which will also lower the value of the euro in relation to the dollar . 
  so my suggestion is at least wait until the end of january . 
  visit the whole of europe in 15 days ? 
  yeah , i think you should go back and tell your wife that 's simply impossible . 
  ok ... first thing :  day 11 -- rome  day 12 - rome  day 13 -- rome -- naples , italy only 2 and a half days in rome ? 
  you 'll either not see many things or you 're going to kill yourself running from one place to another . 
  i would add at least one more day here , at a minimum . 
   day 17 -- venice  day 18 -- venice  day 19 -- venice -- milan , italy venice is nice , but expensive , you might want to cut a day from it . 
  everything is concentrated and you can see pretty much all the nice things in a day . 
  in milan visit the dome , it 's absolutely amazing . 
   day 21 -- zurich  day 22 -- zurich -- interlaken , switzerland  day 23 -- interlaken  day 24 -- interlaken  day 25 -- interlaken  day 26 -- interlaken -- innsbruck , austria i would cut out the entire switzerland part of the trip all together . 
  switzerland is ** very ** expensive and zurich is n't that amazing . 
  the 3 and a half days in interlaken completely baffles me , like ... why ? 
  skip over switzerland is my suggestion . 
  use the freed up days from switzerland to add at least one more day in prague ( it 's super cheap and an amazing city ) and at least 2 more days in berlin . 
   day 45 -- brussels  day 46 -- brussels  day 47 -- brussels -- paris , france brussels is simply a bad idea , there 's really nothing to see . 
  if you want to visit belgium , bruges is where you want to go . 
  you might want to add at least one more day for paris , if you do n't want to run from one place to the next while there . 
  the rest of your schedule is n't bad , i think it 's tiring but doable . 
  i do n't see vienna on your plan though and i think that 's a big mistake , that city is absolutely breathtaking . 
  well ... that 's ambitious , i 'll give you that . 
  it also sounds crazy , that 's way to much space to cover , especially on a budget . 
  as long as you use common sense you 'll be fine , romania has a very low crime rate , lower than most western european countries for that matter . 
  i 'm willing to bet the `` negativity '' comes from people that have n't even so much as seen a picture of romania , let alone actually come here . 
  if you want more information about romania or cluj come to / r/romania and open a thread . 
  if you come to romania during catholic easter holiday everything will be opened , hell even if you come during orthodox easter many things will be opened or at most closed only during easter sunday . 
  are you american or something ? 
  why would you think you 'd have problems going to london or munich as a normal person ? 
  as long as you use common sense you 'll be perfectly safe pretty much anywhere in europe . 
  is your friend getting her news from 1994 ? 
  there 's no chaos in croatia , it 's perfectly safe . 
  no , he really could n't , since he 's going to malta , not a lot of rail links going to malta as you may imagine . 
   but if you are coming to otopeni airport otopeni is the only public airport currently that services bucharest , baneasa has been transformed into an airport for private flights and charters , as such there is no `` if '' . 
  i would advise against it , the ride will take you 45 minutes on a good day and the route to the center has high traffic , as such delays are expected . 
  i would not recommend going without a sim , your best option is to buy a sim card in every country , you can find prepaid cards with very good offers for low price pretty much everywhere . 
  the person/shop you bought it from is responsible for the warranty , since you did n't buy the phone from lg hellas and even more so , they are n't even importing that model they are correct in turning you away . 
  you should go ask whomever you bought the phone from . 
  the tax issue is n't as problematic as you think . 
  while yes , in theory you have to pay us income taxes even if you 're not actually living in the us , the income taxes you pay in the `` foreign '' country you 're living and working in gets deducted from it . 
  as such if you 're living in pretty much any european country the taxes you 'd own the us government would almost always be zero , since income taxes are pretty much across the board higher in europe than in the us . 
  obviously if you 're living in some tax shelter , you will have to pay income taxes to the us , but if we 're talking uk , france , germany , etc than us taxes wo n't be a problem . 
  i 've never heard of a case where such a thing mattered , i do n't think it would hurt your cv , but i also do n't think it will gain you anything . 
  at most it will give you something interesting to say at the interview when/if you 'll be asked what you do in your free time , but in that case it will have the same impact as any other hobby . 
  montenegro probably in 2019 or 2020 , serbia 2025 , albania and macedonia probably 2030-2035 . 
  iceland would be the fastest , but they are n't sure they want to join , but if they really start to open and close chapters it could be done in 2-3 years at most . 
   catalunya will not declare itself independent but the result of the votation will be a strong argument for the eu/spain to do something about it . 
  no , it is n't . 
  the eu will say it 's an internal spanish issue and spain will say the vote is illegal . 
   remember that catalunya already has one parliament , its own police , and most of the administration has a local branch , so it would not be so difficult to adapt it to act as a independent entity . 
  i imagine they would declare themselves as neutral , like ireland did . 
  do n't matter if they do or do n't . 
   the eu and spain needs an hypothetical independent catalunya in the independent market . 
  they can not afford to do the opposite . 
  says who ? 
  you ? 
  the eu wo n't interfere and spain wo n't let catalunya leave and you 're living in a fantasy land , but even in a hypothetical case , catalunya is certainly not important enough to merit an exception , even in the best case scenario , it will still have to apply through the normal accession process . 
  montenegro 2 .
