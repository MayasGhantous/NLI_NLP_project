  i would expect a hardy rendition of `` rule , britannia !, 
  yeah , they really should start using solar power in britain , the sun shines so brightly that one ** day ** a year . 
  what were they thinking ? 
  good . 
  i understood what you said very well , i just think you 're completely wrong . 
  the eu is n't acting in the us 's best interest , it 's acting in its own interest . 
  it just so happens that in the current situation with russia those two things are the same . 
  the eu is reacting , quite slowly i might add , to overtly aggressive actions from russia and most eastern european eu members have been pushing exactly this policy . 
  in fact the closeness of the relationship between the us and eu 's eastern members is exactly a reaction to the belief that the eu was dragging its feet on russia and if western europe wo n't help , than the only alternative is the usa . 
  as a matter of general policy , the eu does n't care that serbia has very close relations with russia , if anything that 's a net negative for eu membership in the current climate , because eastern eu members will simply veto serbia 's admission if they think they 'll let in another vector of russian influence in the eu . 
   i enjoy discussing about economics , you seem to hate it . 
  i enjoy discussing economics , but only with people that are actually capable of doing it . 
  you are n't , as such i 'm not going to bother anymore . 
  exports to the us do not make prices in germany and france go up , what happens is that the producers make more fucking products to sell . 
  as such they can sell more to the us and keep prices the same in france and germany . 
  clearly i 'm wasting my time with your here , i 'm done explaining that 2 +2 = 4 to you . 
   france and germany export to the us so the devaluation does press prices up those two countries , does it not ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm starting to think you 're an idiot . 
  how does french and german exports to the us `` press '' ( what does that even mean in this context ? ), 
  prices in france and germany . 
  i have no idea what you 're asking , but i 'm pretty certain the answer is ** no ** . 
   then , if the prices in italy 's two main partners go up , what do you think will happen with the prices in italy ? 
  it 's clear you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  i already explained this . 
  italian products become cheaper relative to others ** only ** when the end products is sold in a currency that is growing in value relative to euro . 
  italy 's main export markets are germany and france , both of which use the euro , the same currency as italy , as such what you 're talking about does not happen . 
  what he is saying is that italy is in or at least very close to a deflation cycle , meaning italy 's currency , the euro , becomes more expensive , leading to prices of goods in italy to fall . 
  now you might think shrinking prices is good , since it 's cheaper to buy stuff , but it 's actually the worst possible thing that can happen to an economy . 
   well , i 'm not an expert but i do know the theory . 
  no , you actually do n't . 
  you have a vague understanding , but no idea how it all fits together . 
   itally produces goods , not dollars nor euros . 
  those goods are now sold in an area with a cheaper euro . 
  that cheaper euro presses the prices of those goods up . 
  higher prices then cause monetary revenues to increase . 
  increased revenues against the same weight of debt makes debt lighter . 
  i agree that the effect is not as strong ( or it comes not as fast ) as it would be if italy 's main export partners had a different currency but the effect is still there . 
  the value of the euro does n't matter as long as the prices do n't change . 
  italy does produce goods , but they produce those goods with ** euros ** . 
  if those end product ends up being sold in the eurozone , that means that they also get paid euros for that product . 
  it does n't matter if the euro lost value in relation to the dollar or the yen , since neither of those currencies come into play . 
  products produced using euros only become cheaper when they get sold in currencies that gained value in relation to the euro , meaning exports to the us in this case , but since the entire eurozone is going to be experiencing the same loss of euro value than means that any growth of italian exports to the us is going to be small to none . 
   i agree that the effect is not as strong ( or it comes not as fast ) as it would be if italy 's main export partners had a different currency but the effect is still there . 
  no , this is false . 
  this phenomenon only occurs when selling in other currencies than the one the product was made in , as such selling an italian good in germany wo n't lower its price , since it will be sold using the lower valued euro . 
   it 's denominated in euros but those euros are now much cheaper . 
  that might matter if italy was like germany and mostly based their economy on exports , especially exports outside the eu . 
  while yes italian exports are cheaper , so are everyone else in the eurozone as such a growth in exports wo n't be significant , if it will happen at all . 
   of course it matters , devaluating the currency is a way to relief the weight of debt that has been used for centuries ( even more so in italy ) yes , but when they were doing it back then they had their own currency , so they were becoming more competitive against other european countries , but now with the euro they do n't gain any competitiveness against other ez countries , since they use the same currency . 
  i think you should stop talking about this subject , while it 's clear you have a basic understanding of the way things are , you do n't understand how they apply to italy or the ez . 
  you know some theory , but do n't know how to use it . 
  excellent reply , you addressed all his points in a clear and concise manner . 
  the eu is acting in its own interest , is that somehow a surprise to you ? 
  it amazes me the cognitive dissonance you express in this thread . 
  you what the eu to let serbia join much earlier than serbia can or should , but you do n't want serbia to actually do the work . 
  basically you 're asking for free money from the eu and than to let you mind your own business and do free trade deals with big brother russia . 
  wake the fuck up !, 
  if you want to join the eu you 'll have to put a lot of distance between you and russia , it 's unavoidable , just see ukraine and they only signed an association agreement . 
  this attitude of `` give us stuff '' and than fuck off is n't going to fly with brussels . 
  if not italy than it would be somebody else and if not next year than in ten years time . 
  as long as the eurozone is not reformed and functioning mechanisms are implemented to compensate for the imbalances of having a currency union without an actual fiscal union , these types of crises will keep on happening . 
  eu wo n't promise you anything except the chance at becoming a member . 
  if you think the eu will pay you to get yourself out from under russia 's influence , you are out of your mind . 
  that you 'll have to do on your own , because it 's in your interest to do it . 
  did n't i just say that north stream is just as bad ? 
  north stream was built during a time when relation with russia were much warmer , that is no longer the case , as such south stream as gazprom intends to build it will almost certainly run into a brick wall with the eu . 
  south stream might be good for serbia , but most others view it as another attempt by russia at gaining influence , as such serbia will almost certainly be kept out of the eu as long as the issues with it are n't solved . 
  it 's pretty simple , serbia does n't have any leverage . 
  no , north stream is not fine , but it 's also built , additionally serbia is n't already an eu member nor is it as important as germany , that such things can be overlooked . 
   serbia is also one of the few nations that doesnt hate russia but in fact has great historical ties with them and is the only state that maintains a free trade agreement . 
  with serbia joining it could help stabilize relations between the eu and russia . 
  yeah ... that 's a very naive way of thinking , i 'm sorry to say . 
  if serbia joins the eu it will have to cancel all bilateral trade agreements , including the one with russia . 
  since the eu does n't allow for bilateral trade agreements by member states . 
  there 's no way that russia will take that kindly , nor will the eu budge on such an issue , as such serbia will have to choose . 
  also the south stream pipeline , might be great for serbia , but in its current implementation is bad for the eu and the eu 's strategic vision , especially now in regards to ukraine . 
  i have a hard time seeing how the eu will see south stream as a good thing for anyone but russia . 
  while i do think serbia will join the eu , it 's almost certainly not going to be the next country to join . 
  there is still a long way to go before accession is possible , not least of which is the whole kosovo situation . 
  did you look at the file you 're pointing at ? 
  because i have , and there 's nothing there about the ** source ** of the data or what those numbers actually mean . 
  as far as i can tell those numbers are either made up or put subjectively . 
  i want to see the raw data and the methodology . 
  the raw data and the sources are nowhere to be found and the methodology that they do write about on the website is vague and mostly bullshit . 
  nowhere are there the actual numbers , or a methodology about how the numbers they do display were achieved . 
  what 's the source for the numbers ? 
  also it says it 's from 2010 . 
  but then who would cyka blyat in my dota games ? 
  it 's more expensive , but not ridiculously so , besides if russia stops gas deliveries , more expensive gas is better than no gas . 
  the overall issue is about capacity , not cost . 
  the problem is n't production , it 's delivery . 
  pretty sure i read that the us currently lacks an adequate lng terminal on the east coast to facilitate gas deliveries to the eu . 
  one terminal is currently being built from what i read , but it 's still not ready . 
  also i think the eu lacks some terminals also , although they are getting built . 
  who else would it be ? 
   transylvania is first of all in central europe . 
   banat is half-balkan-half-central-europe , and bucovina is half-central-half-eastern . 
  holy shit , self delusion level over 9000 .
