   first off , free trade is agreed bilaterally between countries , so it will lose the free trade with whoever does not want it , not automatically . 
  actually that 's false if you 're talking about eu countries . 
  members of the eu are not allowed to make bilateral trade agreements , all trade agreements must go through the eu and will apply to all 28 member states . 
   if justice is just a policital tool then it fails at it 's main purpose , balancing out the benefits of comiting crimes . 
  no , justice punishes criminals with the purpose to deter others from doing the same . 
  i do n't know what idealistic bullshit you 're eating . 
   yes the joy of seeing nastase in jail is precious but then he just gets out and is received as a maryr and i just trow up a little in my mouth realising that there is no real punishment for corruption , not for people that payed their way trough life . 
  you 're absolutely right , it would have been better if nastase did n't go to prison , because if you ca n't have everything , might as well have nothing . 
  you 're psychotic . 
   we did have it : both with nastase and basesscu . 
  it was not pretty but that is the level of the romanian electorate , we hate alternating powers , we just want one guy to be absolute dicator so whe know who to blame for having shitty lives . 
  and then we did n't . 
  seems like the problem fixes itself . 
   you must be retarded if you thing that a monopoly of thieves is better than when there is actual competition . 
  it 's better if the monopoly if only 10-20 % of total thieves than before and as you quite helpfully pointed out , a monopoly of criminals tends to break up do to interests , as such the monopoly will soon not be a monopoly anymore . 
  got anymore platitudes to post ? 
  god damn i hate you ideologues , nothing but perfect is ever fucking good enough and if you ca n't have perfect it 's better to have nothing . 
  sending 10 % to jail is better than nothing and 50 % is better than 10 % , while 90 % is better than 50 % . 
  so fucking what if you never get to 100 % , i 'll take something over nothing any day . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  are you really asking for a solution to a hypothetical problem that we do n't have ? 
  our current problem is n't that we have one camp , our problem is that we have tens or hundreds of camps , all wanting to steal some money . 
  lets first get down to only having one camp left and then we can think up a solution for that . 
  even if that were true , which i do n't think it is , it 's still better that half of the bad guys end up in prison than none of them . 
  wow much friendly so eco many smart, 
  i 'm pretty sure / u/cyborg _ selkie is actually a she , not a a he . 
  ** breaking news ** : russia threatens to commit economic suicide . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's wrong , the treaty has to be ratified by all 28 national parliaments and the eu parliament before it becomes active . 
   putin plans to spend 21 trillion rubles ( $ 545 billion ) by the end of the decade on refurbishing russia 's armed forces . 
  some of those funds will be used to improve the defense infrastructure of crimea . 
  yeah ... that 's going to happen . 
  as if russia has half a trillion dollars to spend . 
  neither can you gain autonomy without constitutional change . 
  if by average you mean that they are just as much a drain as most other than yes , but my point still stands . 
  in that case that '' , '' is severely misplaced . 
  i 'm sure there are more than that as registered parties , but they have practically no voters and no representatives in parliament . 
   for there to be an autonomous region the constitution would n't want have to be amended absolutely wrong . 
  autonomy does not mean the same thing as a judet , nor is udmr asking for a bigger judet . 
  they want political and administrative autonomy , and that simply wo n't fly . 
  oh my just how much bullshit did you eat ? 
  you think they brought this issue up now because with the elections the media was busy elsewhere ? 
  they brought it up now simply to win political point for the elections , they know very well that this or any proposal is dead in the water . 
   the way udmr ( the representatives of the hungarian minority ) set everything up shows they 're planing on a long play with this . 
  yeah a 200-year plan . 
  because that 's pretty much the only realistic timetable . 
  the only change i 'd actually vote for is giving them full independence , harghita and covasna are a huge drain of money , if they want to make their own decisions , they can make them on their own money . 
  none of this `` we do what we want '' but still get as much money from bucharest as we can . 
  no , because constitution . 
  the current administrative subdivisions are codified in the constitution . 
   why would giving 2-3 counties larger decision making powers over taxes collected locally violate the constitution . 
  because any other form than the current one is unconstitutional and would require a constitutional change . 
  `` coolly '' is an understatement , that plan is doa . 
  threatening to not pay back the money you already borrowed and used because you wo n't get your way in a completely unrelated matter is not how nations that would like to still borrow money act . 
  scotland does n't have any right to a currency union to ruk in case of independence and crying about it does n't make anyone else have sympathy for you , because it makes you look like a petulant child . 
  because the debt in question is money already borrowed and spent , as such scotland already used that money , as such it seems fair to fucking pay it back . 
   berlin was a different story they . 
  about 50 % of them ignored the red light . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  berlin is still very ungerman in a lot of ways , not just this from my experience . 
  it still has a completely different culture than west germany . 
   also the stereotype of german pedestrians not crossing the road when the traffic light shows red ? 
  in my experience that stereotype is absolutely true . 
  i 've worked in germany for some time and i do n't think i 've seen somebody crossing the road with a red light at all , except me of course . 
  there were even a few times when the light was red , but no cars were coming at all and people waited on the sidewalk for the light to turn green . 
  i just started crossing while the red was still on , i wondered if the rest of the people judged me . 
   i had a different understanding of the word than you . 
  i understand that , and i 'm actually sorry i came so hard after you on this , but the only people i 've seen make this mistake and say `` us is a republic , not a democracy '' and think they are actually saying something smart are americans . 
  it 's like somebody made up this meme to win an argument and ** boom ** now everybody starts using it without actually looking in a dictionary to see what the fuck those words mean . 
   i always understood it as not having direct choice over your leaders . 
  the fact that in the us you elect `` electors '' and they vote for the president , does n't mean the us is n't a democracy , it just means it still has an older form of representative democracy . 
  all modern democracies are representative democracies . 
   we vote for people to decide on the president and we vote people into political positions to decide on laws rather than vote for them directly . 
  dude ... that 's the fucking definition of a [ representative democracy ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/representative_democracy.html ) . 
  you 're obviously confusing [ direct democracy ] ( http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepoliticalsystem/a/direct-democracy.htm ) for [ democracy ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy ) . 
   stupid notion ? 
  the u.s is more of a republic than a true democracy the us is both a republic and a democracy , a republic just means that the head of state is an elected position , not inherited , like in a monarchy . 
  saying you 're a republic and not a democracy means you 're at the level of russia , because there the position of president is `` elected '' not inherited , but clearly russia has no functioning democracy , or any democracy as recent events clearly show . 
  in closing democracy and republic are n't on the same scale , they do n't refer to the same thing , countries can be democracies and republics or one of them or none . 
  the terms are grouped like this : democracy/dictatorship , republic/monarchy/theocracy . 
  oh boy , not another one , where do you people come up with these stupid notions ? 
  i 've already addressed [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gtye9/scotland_votes_to_remain_in_the_united_kingdom/ckmliay ) issue . 
  what you got is schooled at english by a non-native speaker , perhaps that should give you pause . 
   edinburgh is also full of english people . 
  holy shit is that an actual real `` no true scotsman '' fallacy that i see before me ? 
  such a perfect end to this thread . 
   hell , even spain itself has an interest in keeping scotland in because their big fishing fleet likes to fish there . 
  not as big of an interest as not giving catalunya any ideas . 
  the rest of your post is just wishful thinking , i think we 're done here . 
   i know that you think that should happen , you do n't need to repeat it . 
  the point is : they have been eu citizens for decades , what 's the point of throwing them out ? 
  the point would be that ** that ** 's the law of the eu . 
  i would think you 'd be more concerned about the rule of law and all that . 
   according to your narrow legalistic approach , that would be allowed . 
  obviously it 's a ridiculous proposition , but so it throwing out the scots for no reason . 
  legally it would be allowed , except for the fact that a scottish village would n't be allowed into the eu in the first place . 
  that was my point . 
   i already addressed those issues , but it seems you do n't want to listen . 
  no , you actually did n't . 
  what you said basically ignores all the realpolitik and all the concerns of the nation states involved , by basically saying `` get the fuck over it '' . 
  i know this might come as news to you , but pretty much telling nation states to get the fuck over something , does n't have much room for success .
