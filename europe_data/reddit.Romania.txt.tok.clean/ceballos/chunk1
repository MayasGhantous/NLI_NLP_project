  [ the president inspecting the troops ] ( http://www.badpolitics.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/armata_revolta.jpg ), 
  the music is nice too, 
  yea he looked into putin 's eyes and saw his soul, 
  ehm we had a golden age in 2007-2008 . 
  edit : no joke , i think the future historians will look at the golden age of romania somewhere between 2000 ( maybe 2004 , 2007 ) to whatever catastophe will happen in the future that sets us back . 
  actual freedom , economic growth , being part of trade blocs/alliances that actually work ( nato , eu ) , internal and external peace , functioning and stable ( while corrupted ) political system . 
  the great recession will be viewed as a setback , the impeachment referendums as normal convulsions of the political system . 
  i only hope this `` golden '' age lasts as much as possible . 
  our other golden ages like others have mentioned were marred by serious societal problems , for example in 1870s the peasantry aka most of the population lived in abject poverty which lead to the 1907 revolt . 
  the 1920s and 1930s were democratic and prosperous but the political system was very unstable , the '30s saw the rise of fascism and royal dictatorship . 
  our alliances were weak and were unprotected from the ussr and nazi germany . 
  nope , the late 40 's and '50s were the bad kind of communism with political prisoners , oppression , show trials , collectivization , terror , etc. 
  the `` good '' communism was after 1964 when the political prisoners were released and some sort of liberalization began and especially in '70s with economic growth and everything . 
  the latter part of the 80s was `` hunger '' communism . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrx5praludy&amp;feature=kp aka the numa numa song , the guys are actually from moldova from the songs linked so far i liked sandstorm , mr vain and asereje when i was younger . 
  we had an eldery woman die in 2011 mauled by a pack of dogs in a courtyard belonging to a municipality agency and nothing happened with the law under a lot of pressure from the `` animal lovers '' and the opposition parties ( which are now in power lolol ) . 
  it took a 4 year old kid to be killed by a pack of dogs to get enough public support . 
  i guess everything for the children right ? 
  take a look at the fb page of an animal lover with who appeared on tv in 2011 here in romania after that woman died to lecture us how we 're barbarians and shit : https://www.facebook.com/pages/maja-prinzessin-von-hohenzollern/127951037266414, 
  soooo you might want to take what they say with a grain of salt . 
  it 's the [ palace of the parliament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament ) aka the people 's house . 
  have n't watched the video , i 'm at work and stuff but be mindful of the uploader , the heritage foundation which is a neocon think-tank . 
  it 's one of those ngo 's which supported the bush administation and iraq invasion with reports like `` we 'll be greeted as liberators '' . 
  the division is between the vast majority of the population and a small vocal minority that spams facebook and social media with images of dead dogs taken from around the world and bloody text with texts like `` massacre '' , `` holocaust '' . . then they forward this shit to their like minded friends in the west and you have such ironic situations of citizens of countries with practice dog culling for decades protesting the romanian embassy for trying to implement a similar law . 
  these protests are mainly sustained by people working for ngo 's , and there a dozens of them only in bucharest , which live from donations and other funds which are directly tied with bucharest and romania in general having a dog problem . 
  most of the ghost ngo 's `` adopt '' dogs from the street and then release them after they were neutered ( or not ) . 
  the 4 year old kid who died was killed by dogs released by one of these ngo 's . 
  when asked , they said theu have no responsibilty for the dogs they released , maybe not a legal one , but surely a moral one . 
  the ngo 's like to say that neutering is the only solution but they do n't say what comes after neutering , which is releasing the dog back to the streets , which continues the problem for ordinary citizen , because neutered or not dogs are still dangerous , noisy and unhealthy by spreading disease . 
  there also the public image problem where romania continues to be associated with pack of dogs on the streets . 
  what a bunch of dumbasses . 
  no need to sweat it , it 's just a nasty jab from a far right republican . 
  if you search a bit i think you can find a quote from some far left french politician saying the us are bad in some way , because of iraq , economic system , whatever . 
  at least you can instantly know a person has 0 knowledge of history when they bring up the whole tired `` french surrendering '' thing , because their military history is quite extraordinary and they were the first ally of the us . 
  i guess the republicans will never forgive the french to saying no to their massive clusterfuck in iraq . 
  i guess we 'll have to live with it . 
  [ noroc ] ( http://www.iqads.ro/pictures/noroc_beri_nou.jpg ) and [ neumarkt ] ( http://prinbrasov.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/neumarkt-produs.jpg ) are sold at a national level , there are a lot of local beers which taste like shit . 
  the neumarkt 0.5 l plastic bottle is called a grenade and is drunk mainly by construction workers and bums . 
  while i do n't agree with the mining project i think watching over this movement is part of this institution 's responsibility . 
  history is full of popular movements infiltrated or taken over by extremists and provocateurs . 
  also i do n't buy this movement being 100 % grassroots so the other forces involved must be watched over . 
  infrastructure . 
  that is never going to happen . 
  you can get by in romania if you talk to young people , most of them speak english . 
  [ andreea balan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpqwlekmum ) this is nsfw and way more revealing than the clip op posted . 
  yea but the riot still happened . 
  i hate to , ehm . . , bear the bad news but i think it 's * bear * handed . 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  i think they were policemen in civilian clothes . 
  damn it , so close, 
  what exactly is wrong with the marseille area ? 
  serious question btw . 
  it 's not like we are being blocked as it is . 
  we just have to wait longer at border crossings , show id cards , etc. 
  of course it 's a right-wing campaign issue for the germans , if corruption was actually tied with schengen area not only romania and bulgaria should n't be allowed to enter but a lot of other states should be forced to leave . 
  it 's kind of frustrating though , to keep being postponed every 6 months . 
  hey guys i think he just called us gypsies . 
  i 'd say [ ionel bratianu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_i._c._br%c4%83tianu ) for his role in the 1918 union , paris negotiations , internal reforms . 
  his death in 1927 and that of king ferdinand brought a period of internal unrest , aggravated by the great depression , extremism in the 1930s and all the bad things that happened after that . 
  yes it can translate this bullshit in almost any language . 
  this article is a load of partisan bullshit . 
  the outcome of this election was known from opinion polls since 2 years ago when the winning alliance was formed not because this alliance is great but because their opponents led by the accident of history that is our president are so bad . 
  also this type of tone is rather insulting especially comparing these elections to ones held under soviet occupation or the ones in post ww1 despression era germany . 
  as for the guy who posts this bullshit here , you are free to emigrate , i heard spain is in dire need of strawberry pickers . 
  do n't let the door hit you in the ass . 
  is n't that boiko borisov , the bulgarian pm ? 
  do n't let the door hit you in the ass ... * please ignore the guy above me and his alarmist , butthurt tirade . 
  his guys did n't win , so everybody must be lazy/uneducated , also omg belarus . 
  it 's a nice thought but things do n't work like that in geopolitics . 
  the us has the interest of eu being its ally but it should be weak enough and fractured enough to not pose a threat to its hegemony . 
  it 's just the way things work , if eu became a state tomorrow , it 's total gdp would be higher than that of the us , i do n't think that would sit well with us leadership and public . 
  it 's an easy joke to make but he 's right, 
  in english, 
  your point is extremely shallow and based on dumbed down history . 
  slavery and genocide are not exclusive to european nations . 
  you will find quite a few genocides and slavery like if not actual slavery outside europe in the 20th century and even 21st century . 
  maybe you are familiar with the rwandan genocide and the japanese treatment of fellow asians before and during ww2 . 
  yeah but i said cheap not cheapest or cheaper than x. 
  like some other guy said it 's around 8 euro/month . 
  still cheap, 
  not only that but : - complains that paris attacks will shift focus from climate summit - compares mediterranean influx of migrants to auschwitz death camp how does a tumblr blog become deputy prime minister ? 
  my guess goes to bitterness over https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_cosmin_forest, 
  just for historical accuracy , the eastern part of the principality of moldavia ( modern republic of moldova ) was annexed by the russian empire in 1812 and it stayed in its possession till 1918 when it returned to romania , only to be annexed again by the ussr in 1940 . 
  a big earthquake would level a big part of the historic centre and other older buildings in bucharest . 
  some high risk buildings are being consolidated because a law was passed after the nightclub fire in october last year in order for them to house commercial activity . 
  let 's settle for poor gypsy vampires with fast internet ? 
  romania as viewed from abroad : 1970s : nadia comaneci 1980s : ceausescu , revolution 1990s : child aids , poverty 2000s : gypsies 2010s : fast internet , anti-corruption i 'm moderately optimistic about the trend . 
  it was a salad of european stereotypes but it was pretty funny when i saw it back in high school . 
  it 's eurotrip . 
  candidates react to bernie 's tweet : donald trump : we have the fastest internet speed in trump international hotel vegas , best hotel in vegas . 
  people love my internet . 
  hillary clinton : female internet users have 77 % of the speed male users have . 
  we need to fix the speed gap . 
  why do you say it 's a disgusting place ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  college extremist speaks to left wing media . 
  more at 9 . 
  the suspension is not `` possible '' , it 's implemented since 24 august last year : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html you 've got no clue about current events in europe , talking about `` possible '' suspension and `` secure '' syrian cities and jobs . 
  i 'm done here .
