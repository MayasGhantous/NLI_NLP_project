  latvia is getting dropped from nato if anything happens . 
  second , latvia has a big russian minority . 
  russia 's bullshit about crossing the border into ukraine to protect ethnic russians has worked flawlessly . 
  there 's no reason why they would n't invoke it again . 
  plus i 'd imagine the russian minority will be put to good use , terrorism , guerrilla warfare , all without russia officially declaring war . 
  well , considering that * nothing * has been done yet , this is quite significant . 
  a handful of latvians with some flag have shown more spine than the us . 
  well done , superpower . 
  you 're right , it 's europe 's problem , but nobody told europe apparently . 
  [ one month ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vxm3h/is_there_anything_europe_could_realistically_do/cewy3my?context=3 ) , before people started dying , i was trying to warn people that this will get out of hand really fast . 
  if [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-ukraine-crisis-breedlove-idusbrea1q1f220140227 ) is an accurate window into nato 's collective intentions i think it 's safe to say there is nothing there to stop russia taking over ukraine in its entirety . 
   breedlove said neither the united states nor the 28-nation western alliance had drawn up contingency plans for how to respond if russian forces did move militarily in crimea . 
   `` right now we are not planning contingencies on how to respond here . 
  what we are doing is supporting the peaceful resolution of this business , '' breedlove said . 
  i would strangle this worthless waste of oxygen with my bare hands . 
  i think that even the most retarded libertarian would acknowledge the fact that russia occupying ukraine would be the start or something awful for * everyone * . 
  russian weapons moved a full meridian to the west , increased presence in the black sea , moldova becomes an easy target , etc. 
  a gruesome set of ramifications . 
  if you want to cover your eyes and stand idle as well , until it * does * become your problem too then ok , ww3 it is . 
  edit : some grammar, 
  just a week ago i said [ russia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ygi3o/eu_to_impose_sanctions_on_ukrainian_officials/cfkjgfp?context=3 ) will [ act ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1yjlky/russia_rattles_sabre_over_fate_of_crimea/cflag0p?context=3 ) . 
  my predictions have been flawless so far . 
  i wonder why ? 
  am i a psychic ? 
  am i secretly putin ? 
  or am i intimately familiar with russian `` logic '' and `` policy '' simply by virtue of being romanian and not suffering from stockholm syndrome ? 
  the us would 've stepped in by now had mitt romney been president . 
  unfortunately for us , the american general public is so far removed from the realities of the planet that their sexual minorities ' demands , drugs and daddy issues all played a major part in electing the supreme commander of the military of what is on paper the most powerful nation on earth . 
  kind of a blunder if you ask me . 
  i 'd wager obama himself recognizes the huge danger an occupied ukraine would mean for everyone . 
  but i think any intervention would mean no democrat would get elected for at least one term , possibly two . 
  his approval ratings are already low , a lot of democrats would sit the next elections out and if the us steps in and uncovers that the snipers that shot the protesters were actually full russians or something like that , a lot more people are gon na vote republican because they would feel like obama acted too late . 
  and since democrats are willing to go to war anyway , why not vote republican and wage war properly ? 
  so yeah , expect ukraine to get a lot worse . 
  and expect moldova to follow shortly . 
  as apathetic as romanians are right now regarding anything other than their vacations and their terrible food , russia making a move on moldova will cause a lot of people to go mad over night . 
  a fun fact about romania : the current president took the former regime 's ( iliescu-nastase ) methods and went full retard , abusing them beyond all reason . 
  not only does he have like 10 different institutions hounding his opposition with endless stupid trials and convictions , all but 1 tv station , all but 1 newspaper and a hundred blogs whose sole purpose for the past 10 years has been unbridled character assassination of his opponents , he distinguishes himself from his predecessors by also keeping his `` allies '' at a safe distance at all times or under his heel , respectively . 
  now , i and many other romanians do n't like him very much . 
  but that does n't really matter . 
  whether you like him or not , his decade of being a enormous jackass has taken a grueling toll on the country 's political landscape . 
  there is simply no one to vote for anymore . 
  no , not like the stupid american rhetoric , there is no current politician that even * has * a real stance , a real identity , for better or for worse , not even from his camp . 
  he is president for 10 years and he has n't groomed anyone to be his successor , not even `` his party '' dared to put anyone forward . 
  his only real friends are the goons that run the 7 romanian secret services . 
  that 's what antisocial personality disorder does to people . 
  and his opposition looks like shit , one wants to jump ship into his tribe and the other one does n't even want to run for president . 
  romania has a semi-presidential system and there 's no potential president in sight . 
  anyway , his second and final term expires this year . 
  i wonder what effect would russian aggression on moldova have on an administratively empty romania . 
  i think there 's a very high change that the far right ( the * real * far right , heil hitler , people who want to die drowning in russian blood ) would take over the streets * and * the political scene , since there 's nobody there , pro-russia or otherwise , to stop them . 
  i 'm ... mostly ok with that . 
  unless the us does something more than `` strengthen its ties with moldova and georgia '' i foresee guerrilla warfare in the area between the nistru 's mouth and the danube delta by the end of the spring . 
   it was the soviet union who won the ww2 providing more then 6 million soldiers to the eastern front and defeating the germans . 
  uhh ... that 's ... actually part of the reason ukrainians are so angry . 
  i 'm getting the feeling that our definitions of `` free '' are very different . 
  i do n't know how many people in norway , or anywhere in the west , can understand the nature of the conflict between russia and everyone to their immediate west . 
  we are well past historical borders , racial and cultural reality , strict interests of each country and things like that . 
  russians showed beyond any reasonable doubt that they do n't care about those things , they do n't deal in those coins , they do n't speak those languages . 
  they only speak rape . 
  we 're even past the point of hoping that russia will ever stop being awful . 
  think of [ total war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/total_war ) , now try to imagine `` total hatred '' . 
  we do n't hate them * specifically because * they 1984ed eastern europe , it transcends that . 
  imagine if every reason for despising them was color , like imperial russian expansion was red , the winter war was green , russification was blue , etc. 
  throughout the years , all colors have mixed together and produced this grey . 
  this all-encompassing , final hatred . 
  it has no identifiable cause anymore and no foreseeable solution . 
  even if a meteor pulverized russia right now , i 'm afraid the hatred would n't go away . 
   the difficulty in understanding the russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a european , but an asiatic , and therefore thinks deviously . 
  we can no more understand a russian than a chinaman or a japanese , and from what i have seen of them , i have no particular desire to understand them , except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them . 
  in addition to his other asiatic characteristics , the russian have no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch , barbarian , and chronic drunk . 
  - * general patton *, 
  good riddance , they got to where they were purely on the promise that they will sodomize basescu once in power . 
  and not only has there been a complete lack of any kind of sodomy , but both ponta and antonescu have `` reevaluated '' their stances on multiple issues to resonate with basescu 's stances . 
  way to throw all those votes down the drain fellas !, 
  sweet perfume . 
  well , if this whole thing was in a magical vacuum and the options were either a ) invade ukraine or b ) do n't invade ukraine , i would say definitely no . 
  but europe does n't exist in a vacuum , neither does ukraine and neither does russia . 
  when the only official statements from russia have been either direct threats of violence or telling yanukovych to man up , the world has to stop thinking in the a ) invade ukraine or b ) do n't invade ukraine dilemma and start considering the a ) invade ukraine now or b ) wait until russia does it scenario . 
  i do n't think most people are willing to ponder what a serious hostile russian military presence in ukraine would mean for the world . 
  russian weapons moved a full meridian to the west , increased presence in the black sea , moldova becomes an easy target , etc. 
  like i said , once that happens , i think war is inevitable . 
  just as [ i thought ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vxm3h/is_there_anything_europe_could_realistically_do/cewy3my?context=3 ) . 
  soft power quickly becomes derisory in the face of physical martial reality . 
  `` just as we did in georgia '' is about as direct , immediate and real as it gets as far as threats go . 
  [ yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ygi3o/eu_to_impose_sanctions_on_ukrainian_officials/cfkjgfp?context=3 ) i was saying how it 's still possible to prevent this from happening if europe acts accordingly , sends troops to western ukraine to protect the population and meet the russian aggression halfway . 
  hey remember when not even a month ago there were a lot of people on reddit ( me ) who were freaking the fuck out about ukraine and how bad it 's gon na get ? 
  * [ 1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w4q4y/people_of_ukraine_ask_the_world_for_support_xpost/ceyvs2y?context=3 ) * [ 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xlsyp/feurope_good_read/cfcn5id?context=3 ) * [ 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3zdx/united_we_stand_for_ukraine_vilnius_lithuania/ceymrmr?context=3 ) * [ 4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vy7wm/kgb_of_transnitria_wants_moldova_to_withdraw_in_a/cex9g8x?context=3 ) * [ 5 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vxm3h/is_there_anything_europe_could_realistically_do/cewy3my?context=3 ) * [ 6 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1x9b0d/russian_adviser_threatens_ukraine_with_military/cf9b2n7?context=3 ) * [ 7 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1x6u93/fuck_the_eu_frustrated_nuland_says_to_pyatt_in/cf9b9oq?context=3 ) and they 're * just now * considering ** sanctions ** !, 
  unbelievable , completely unreal . 
  have you ever thought about deleting your reddit account with all of its comments and hanging yourself ? 
  yes , the stockholm syndrome is still strong in romania . 
  you 'll find plenty of romanians , like these 3 dumbasses , willing to sacrifice their last molecule of elementary human decency for * the chance * to defend russia and communism in general . 
  i 'm fully aware of how nato is supposed to work on paper . 
  but i also think that ultimately countries like lithuania , estonia or romania matter very little to the west . 
  add to that the nature of the sentiment between russians and its western neighbors , blood enmity on both sides , psychotic hatred to the point where people are repulsed by the other side 's facial features or wince when they hear their language . 
  i 'm not gon na go full alex jones and claim that there 's a secret plan to kick us out of nato if russia does anything . 
  ** but ** , this conflict is about so much more than earth and water . 
  it would n't surprise me if nato as in the us and western europe would n't want anything to do with this mess . 
  i 'm very familiar with presidents trying to sit on 2 chairs at once . 
  `` my '' president bows to the eu day in and day out and it 's been recently found out that him and his daughter are in some shady deal with gazprom .
