  so it would n't be anything our of the ordinary around here . 
  i 'm not sure how the 2010 elections took place considering what happened in 2004 . 
  plus yanukovych is for all intents and purposes russia 's man . 
  see [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1y8qt2/well_known_ukrainian_academic_and_think_tank/cfij7m5 ) . 
  i 'm having trouble understanding how russia breathing down the back of ukraine 's neck is internal . 
  the conflict is `` internal '' as in the country next door has twisted their arm too hard and now the regime they propped up is under fire ( and will probably be under fire for real very soon ) . 
  i think it 's at least sophist to call this internal . 
  the bulgarian riots against those gypsy thugs a few years ago , that was an internal thing . 
  honest question for western europeans : are you mindful of the fact that , despite the constant stream of demagoguery pouring out of your leaders ' mouths 24/7 for the past decade or so , ukraine is not `` over there '' ? 
  there is no actual physical barrier separating it from the eu or anything like that . 
  it 's right there , at the eu border , its westernmost point is roughly the same as lithuania 's . 
  are you not aware that civil war , a split ukraine and complete russian military occupation are all very possible and probable in light of the west 's complete unwillingness to do anything at all ? 
  are you not aware that if/when this happens , moldova will probably undergo the same ordeal ? 
  are you not aware that if that happens and the eu continues doing nothing , there 's no reason whatsoever for russia to * not * consider neighboring countries like romania or lithuania as potential targets ? 
  if you loudly and proudly celebrate your own impotence to do literally anything when russia is killing citizens of a country at your own doorstep , the question becomes * why not keep going west * ? 
  especially when the one asking it is russia . 
  the eu will just shed another piece of its tail and claim that its easternmost countries were never really part of the union because whatever . 
  the window for military intervention as a means to * end * the conflict , smack russia 's hooves off ukraine for a while with minimal loss of life , has closed months ago . 
  * now * it 's likely to elicit a response from russia . 
  and the next window , that of military intervention being realistically possible without starting a full blown war , is closing fast with every second you stand idle . 
  but by all means , if you think gangrene is gon na miraculously heal on its own and amputation is icky than continue doing nothing . 
  just have the human dignity to not cry * nazis * when russian troops start getting decapitated and impaled upon their incursions . 
  no , russia wants to wage war with europe . 
  i 'm not the one directly threatening a country with military action , russia is . 
   anti-state \u2022 anti-war \u2022 pro-market i am literally hiv positive right now . 
   putin 's russia is no utopia , but do we really want angry , expansionist russians again on our eastern borders ? 
  better they focus on olympic games and shopping sprees . 
  unlike us , they have not started any wars lately . 
  russia is already at the eastern borders . 
  fuck me , i ca n't believe somebody actually took the time to write this miscarriage of an article . 
  there has been direct mention of military intervention from russia and people in ukraine explicitly said they fully expect it . 
  * being an edgy libertarian will not stop them . 
  soft `` power '' will not stop them . 
  pacifism will not stop them . 
  * the only thing that will is a kick in the teeth from the west . 
  the only question is , do you * really * want to wait until ukraine is split in half and russia starts applying the same pressure on transnistria and moldova ? 
  * western europeans , make sure to act outraged and appalled and cry the communists a river , just like you always do . 
  three days ago i stumbled upon [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1x6u93/fuck_the_eu_frustrated_nuland_says_to_pyatt_in/cf8o8fp ) . 
  the european union should change its name to the having our cake and eating it too union . 
  honestly , if half the members do n't leave in 10 years i 'll be surprised . 
  yes , the wages are bad and all that but there 's definitely something more to it . 
  when your president explicitly paints targets on your forehead for years blaming you , as a state employee , for the financial crisis i think you have to seriously reevaluate your entire existence . 
  and when the same president explicitly states that the brain drain romania is experiencing is a good thing , according to him the doctors that left will `` eventually return home with their superior skills acquired in the west '' , i think one has to seriously take a hard look at life . 
  when random citizens with half your iq ask why your salary should be raised , `` as if you had 2 mouths or something '' , i think the question of leaving romania becomes one of personal integrity and human dignity above everything else . 
  shut the ** fuck ** up !, 
  you ca n't even begin to grasp what living next door to the 20th century 's biggest terrorists and savages does to you . 
  there should be some sort of unwritten rule where countries not bordering russia should keep their self-righteous phantasmagoria to themselves whenever things like this happen . 
  i swear to fucking jesus christ in heaven , there is nothing more obnoxious that anglo-saxons running their dainty little mouths , lecturing us about how to deal with being born under the looming threat of genocide and cultural annihilation , all from the safety of your geographical ivory tower . 
  go to hell . 
  i like how the eu can bust serbia 's balls on trivial matters under the pretense that it 's part of europe and should be striving for eu membership and all that self-empowering nonsense but whenever the door swings both ways , like in does in ukraine right now , all of the sudden that country off on it 's own . 
  it 's `` somebody else 's '' , it 's none of europe 's business , it 's `` over there '' , it 's out of their moral jurisdiction . 
  this is one of the main reasons why so many people hate the eu . 
  repugnant hypocrisy , blatant cowardice and utter impotence to ever back up half the shit they talk . 
  indeed , fuck the eu . 
   ukrainian protesters say they have no doubt russia will intervene militarily in the unrest plaguing the former soviet territory for months . 
  this is what i said [ two weeks ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vy7wm/kgb_of_transnitria_wants_moldova_to_withdraw_in_a/cex9g8x?context=3 ) . 
  and the west * still * has the opportunity to be the first one who steps in . 
  not for long though . 
  what happens if russia establishes a military presence in ukraine ? 
  merkel flees to portugal ? 
  [ i tried . 
   soviet union  save lives hhhhehehe, 
   the imperialist europeans are trying to muscle in to russian affairs and enforce their will on the region , while rebuffing russian calls for dialogue . 
  which * should * be the course of action right now . 
  the only language russia speaks is the fist , it 's the only thing they understand . 
  and it 's the only thing anyone can use if they hope of ever having their concerns * heard * , let alone taken into consideration , in a situation such as ukraine 's . 
  so , it looks like a russian , it talks like a russian ... ** nonono status quo power balance such danger many risk so ascared wow do n't say it very fear !, 
   eu leaders are steeling themselves for a bruising summit with vladimir putin , russian president , as moscow stresses that it is in no mood to be lectured over the deepening crisis in ukraine . 
  it 's beyond me how europe still has n't put the * persona non grata * label on this fucker . 
  i maeak funnty !, 
  good , this is n't the 90s anymore . 
  the word `` racist '' has lost much of its power , as has accusing someone of racism . 
  and it 's a wonderful thing . 
  a standard creationist argumentative `` tactic '' is to `` set 10 fires '' or `` coat the opponent in mud '' . 
  just drop a ridiculous statement and sit back . 
  something that 's outright not true like `` there are no transitional fossils '' or something that 's equivalent to hurling a boulder in a lake in terms of the ease with which it can be put forth and the difficulty or time needed to disprove it , like `` why are there still monkeys herp derp '' . 
  the logic behind this being that your opponent will spend so much and energy disproving your bullshit that he wo n't have any left to try and vouch for his . 
  this has been a standard `` method '' used by the left when arguing with the right . 
  just drop `` racism '' or `` hitler '' and go afk . 
  whenever anyone disagrees with the left 's ideas when it comes to issues relating to race , even marginally , they get sabotaged . 
  but all that seems like it 's about to change . 
  can you imagine ? 
  the left actually learning how to argue from a logical standpoint ? 
  holy shit !, 
  do n't expect anyone to do anything until the boiler blows through the roof . 
  and then expect the standard baffling arrogance and self-empowerment from the west , calling protesters fascists or criminals or whatever . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  fuck every single eu/nato figurehead , what a useless conglomeration of cunts . 
  civil war is happening at the eu border and they 're smelling their own farts . 
  what the fuck would it actually take for you to do something ? 
  so , what would it take to get a similar reaction from the west ? 
  berkut kidnapping * gay * protesters from the hospitals and murdering them ? 
   romanians reacted with fury , taking to social media and talk shows to accuse the government of incompetence and complacency after it emerged the least injured of the survivors called emergency services six times . 
   it took 4 1/2 hours for local villagers and a woodcutter to locate the plane in transylvania after it lost altitude and crashed at 1,400 meters ( 4,600 feet ) above sea level . 
  but medical teams arrived hours later and were reportedly ill-equipped . 
  the plane , carrying two pilots and five medical workers , was on its way to pick up a liver for a transplant . 
   `` the government generally does nothing , and in this case they did nothing to locate the plane . 
  a woodcutter had to find them , '' aviation professor nicolae serban tomescu said . 
  `` the rescue operation was like swiss cheese . 
  there were holes everywhere . '' the important part is not the plane crash or even the fact that 2 people died .
