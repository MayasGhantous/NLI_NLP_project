  it 's the authorities ' criminal indolence and unpreparedness . 
  they sent the search parties out in the field with maps made for tourists , they did n't have real maps . 
  this is the kind of bullshit we have to deal with . 
  oh yeah , and the press attacking raed arafat , founder of [ smurd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smurd ) , for no discernible reason does n't help at all . 
  in fact , the last time someone attacked raed arafat out of the blue , basescu 's famous `` riddle me this '' rant , a government or two fell . 
  if we close our eyes and count to 100 i 'm sure the russian problem will go away . 
  it 's not like this is europe 's problem as much as ukraine 's or romania 's . 
  let 's all jerk each other off with pointless rhetoric and wait for russia to suddenly acknowledge how cool the eu is and that peace is really good and that violence is not good and that they should totally stop because like we ca n't anything so it 's not cool man ... dude . 
  and they call ion antonescu a criminal , unbelievable . 
  the eu will go down in history as an oddity whose overall purpose and mo have never been immediately obvious . 
  between the double standards , massive hypocrisy , selective racism and predatory loaning , i think it 's safe to say it 's a failed experiment . 
  ** but ** , even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  the current situation in ukraine is a golden opportunity for the eu to do something unequivocally good , useful and lasting . 
  at the end of the day for all the wrong reasons , i 'm sure . 
  but if ukrainians receive the gift horse of no longer having russia breathing down their necks , i do n't think they 're gon na be looking in its mouth anytime soon . 
  your , our , `` realistically '' does n't match russia 's `` realistically '' . 
  your `` realistically '' entails a strict set of rules , walking on eggshells , a nonviolent approach . 
  their `` realistically '' does n't . 
  they are profoundly savage and the only status quo they 're willing to maintain is rape-rape-rape . 
  guess who 's gon na get wrecked when these 2 mentalities clash ? 
  escalation from the west is literally the only way this can be stopped . 
  the sooner the better . 
  anything is appropriate when russia is your neighbour . 
   romania violates the rights of gypsies russia crying racism is really funny considering they 're the most racist people on the planet next to jews . 
  `` riddle me this ! '', 
  yep , with the president being involved in not one , not two , but three cases that would 've landed any other politician in prison , probably for life , i 'd say that his ability to legally hurl bullshit case after bullshit case at the opposition day in and day out with no consequences balances the state powers perfectly . 
  thank god for his immunity , which is n't mentioned anywhere in the constitution . 
  would n't the fact that it was repelled unanimously reinforce the idea that the cc is under the president 's control ? 
  i do n't oppose the eu per se , i just wish merkel would stop trying to have her cake and eat it too . 
  you either : a ) stop supporting basescu and his tribe . 
  b ) shut up about romania 's corruption . 
  either one of these would be fine by itself . 
  but doing both of them at the same time is really stupid and leads nowhere . 
  i 'm glad you mentioned antena 3 . 
  not many people remember , or maybe they do n't like to remember , that a3 , well specifically mircea badea , has always been critical of nastase . 
  back when this [ famous photo ] ( http://www.curierulnational.ro/poze-cnr/15994maxim.jpg ) was taken , none of the dozens of public figures that are currently taking turns condemning him even dared to look at him funny . 
  not to mention being critical of basescu straight from the get go , since 2004 , when literally no one , not ponta , not antonescu , no one , was saying shit to him back then . 
  i 'd rather stick with them . 
  antena 3 is n't protesting nastase 's incarceration . 
  they 're protesting against the sinister system and fundamentally communist methodology that led to the verdict . 
  judging and condemning people based on their political affiliation instead of their potential criminal past is not justice . 
  it 's not a means to an end , it 's not `` texan '' and it 's not `` the right thing to do '' . 
  if you plan to reduce corruption , even tangentially , this kind of system is the most counterproductive system you can have . 
  it * is * corruption . 
  why do you think that eu fund absorption rate has been close to 0 ? 
  anyway , no one would be protesting if nastase would 've been tried for his legitimate communist ties or his legitimate communist mo that he operated under well into the 2000s . 
  mircea badea 's match factory ordeal being a prime example of what kind of person nastase was and where he belongs . 
  but the zambaccian case and the trophy of quality case are nothing short of pathetic . 
  the most important thing by far when talking about justice is methodology , the actual guilt or innocence of the people involved comes second . 
  by the way , i did n't vote for the usl and i 'm not a fan of ponta or antonescu . 
  [ also , i happen to be the most anti communist romanian on reddit by a long shot . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rlkgs/children_in_exile_the_story_of_polish_children/cdp12yq ), 
  no , my point was * technically * they have it but actually they do n't . 
  that 's what the word * technically * means , i know words are hard . 
  i 'm entertaining this conversation purely out of morbid curiosity at this point . 
  what the fuck do you mean by * enough * ? 
  enough for what ? 
  enough for romania to be in line with its own constitution where it clearly state that it 's not a presidential republic ? 
  not that anyone as primitive as yourself even understands what that means . 
  hey what are you gon na do this year when basescu will be leaving for good ? 
  can you imagine what life would be like without your dadgod ? 
  you will be literally molested by communists and miners on a daily basis . 
  do let me know if you 're gon na be committing physical suicide . 
  truth be told , you do a much better job than me . 
  well , * technically * they 're in power . 
  as in , in any other country with a similar political structure , and one not filled to with wormy communist cocksuckers like yourself , the government-president relationship would ensure the authority of the psd/usl , both internal and external , in strict synergy with the president 's role as an ** apolitical ** mediator of internal powers . 
  now , even someone as impossibly stupid as yourself is bound to notice that the current state of affairs in romania looks nothing like that . 
  the roles have been more than turned on their heads . 
  basescu is acting as president * and * government * and * party leader * and * some other weird shit i ca n't even qualify including some sort of supreme distributor of divine justice , basically a dictator . 
  the only power in romania is in his hands only trickles down to his slaves , everyone else is the opposition . 
  when udrea gets so much as a smack on the wrist for the alro case or the bute case then your status as chief of cretins * may * be downgraded . 
  until then get fucked . 
  wow , i can actually take my time to [ put some arguments together ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1smzeo/romanian_parliament_sparks_harsh_international/cdzcfku?context=3 ) and objectively demonstrate why you 're a fucking mongoloid but you seem to be doing that yourself quite effectively . 
  at least drop that pathetic facade about being western and being for democracy . 
  if you call for all members of the opposition to be killed by your glorious leader without the slightest hint of humor in the year 2013 then at least let your red flag fly where others can see it . 
  ok buddy , i 'm getting the feeling you 'll be `` benefiting '' from this `` progress '' a lot more than me . 
  if by `` there '' you mean pax basescica , where the basis for eliminating politicians is whether or not they like basescu , then yes we 'll definitely get there if things go on like this . 
  do you guys not realize that this is * literally * the communist system minus the gulags ? 
   the problem is that this is just a drop in a bucket and corruption is as prevalent in politics as it ever was . 
  well yes , that happens when a country 's justice system is essentially run by one person ( basescu ) and its fundamental purpose changes from punishing criminality to serving that person 's political interest . 
  the 2 areas may accidentally overlap from time to time but i do n't see how anyone expects corruption to go down in romania when all the major institutions that are supposed to be working against it are busy doing basescu 's bidding . 
  i want to reiterate this bit of trivia . 
  basescu is the only romanian politician whose trial was indefinitely postponed due to his seat . 
  out of the greeks or romanians that actually know what the imf is , 90 % of them want to see it and its loans die in a fire . 
  that kind of thinking does n't work . 
  russia is like a virus . 
  if john has cholera and he 's holding hands with jane , who 's holding hands with mary , mary is just as exposed as jane . 
  now replace john with russia , jane with the eastern bloc and mary with the eu . 
  i mean , if you feel like it 's gon na stop at transnistria then sure , that would be the safest course of action . 
  but there has been literally no evidence to suggest that russia operates like that . 
  so how long until military action is taken against russia ? 
  their train clearly has no breaks , it never did . 
  i suppose the more ukraine and moldova slide towards the eu , the harder it 's gon na be to ignore the reality that all inches previously given to russia must be taken back asap . 
  y' all have a nice century now . 
   logical we 're talking about russia here , the tribe that has loudly and proudly denounced all things human and made bestiality ( as in acting like animals , not having sex with them ) into state policy for almost a century now . 
  the only `` logic '' they go by is ** picichi smash !, 
  latin languages ( minus french ) sound like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ppiajuv60 germanic languages sound like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9x_ohcqrcw slavic languages sound like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjvsojyx3t8 and french sounds like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawfctuvhh8 yes . 
  wait , you mean [ dogecoin ] ( http://dogecoin.com/ ) is illegitimate too ? 
  such sad, 
  the eu treating us like second class citizens , italian doctors saying italian hearts are not for romanians , those things .
