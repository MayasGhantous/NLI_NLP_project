  where former * nazi collaborators congregate to plan another 6 million holocausts and invade the peaceful communist utopia that is russia again for no reason whatsoever * . 
  holy stockholm syndrome , you 're a walking pustlence !, 
  because those fucking animals have such a good image , especially in these here parts , what with the cultural annihilation , the deportations and the elimination of the elite , right ? 
  surely making them look bad would have to involve * propaganda * !, 
  i can not for the life of me imagine any series of events that would make me feel anything but hatred towards them . 
  translation from cretinian to english :  europe is increasingly softer on crime . 
  you 'd like the balkans . 
  we gave the west some gypsies , now can they give us some nationalism in return ? 
  we 're all out unfortunately . 
  a bit of trivia americans may not be familiar with : even though the russian language is part of the slavic ( indo-european ) family , the people 's geographic distribution , their general animosity towards europe and even their facial features has led some people to believe that they should n't be classified as indo-european . 
  this theory has been kind of popular for quite some time . 
  general patton said :  the difficulty in understanding the russians is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a european , but an asiatic , and therefore thinks deviously . 
  we can no more understand a russian than a chinaman or a japanese , and from what i have seen of them , i have no particular desire to understand them , except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them . 
  in addition to his other asiatic characteristics , the russian have no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch , barbarian , and chronic drunk . 
  they do n't like it very much . 
  holy shit , this is supposed to portray russia in a positive light and they * still * depict themselves as mongoloid barbarians . 
  you could n't make this shit up . 
  that 's not irony . 
  the local russian population should get on their knees and thank them every day for not being fed to crocodiles . 
  no , we need to do much more than that . 
  how funny is this shit ? 
  people still not denouncing communism in 2013 . 
  just a year ago i was eastern europe 's athlete . 
  but it 's really hard to vouch for someone who would jump in front of a train if it meant not doing himself ** one ** favor . 
  i 'm sorry , this is beyond ridiculous . 
  the dna 's activity is ** entirely ** politically motivated , 100 % , no exception apart from the occasional obsolete underling that basescu has no further use for that gets put though the wringer so as to showcase the institution 's supposed neutrality . 
  of course , most if not all of the people that they target * do * , in fact , have a shady past and * could * potentially be accused of one thing or another . 
  but there are a couple of problems . 
  first of all , the dna is comprised of cretins . 
  they could n't even come up with a solid case against nastase for christ 's sake . 
  that 's like being unable to prove that fish live in water . 
  you would have to be impossibly stupid and incompetent to whiff that one . 
  even if their actions were n't politically motivated , i would n't want people who drool on themselves wielding that kind of power . 
  and then , like i said , the dna is entirely under basescu 's control . 
  i do n't care who they put away as long as it 's based on political affiliation . 
  that 's not justice , that 's communist bullshit . 
  ** but chodechugging they put al capone in prison for tax evasion !, 
  ** that 's because al capone actually did a fair bit of tax evasion , a very serious offense that plenty of people end up in prison for . 
  look up wesley snipes ' situation . 
  i do n't see where you 're going with this . 
  cars were being set on fire in the muslim protests a few months ago in sweden ( or was it norway ? ), 
  and the authorities did nothing . 
  i like how virtually all protests , except for wbc picketing , are super awesome and a healthy manifestation of beautiful , bohemian people expressing their sacred desires , letting the man know that their graceful spirits will not be conquered . 
  except for when they happen to be against russia/communism . 
  go to hell . 
  from the place jim jones ' bullshit about the government stealing their kids to `` convert them to fascism '' came from , they 're both communists . 
  so what 's your point ? 
  currently romania is a borderline anarchist state with no civil society , no standards , no government , no legislation , no culture , no dignity and no future . 
  all thanks to communism , that thing you love so much . 
  apart from military conflict with russia , something that is frankly inevitable if the moldova/transnistria problem is ever to be resolved , i do n't see any way this could be harmful . 
  like , that 's not even possible . 
  just pretend they 're here to remove some evil nationalists/fascists/legionares who wanttokillsixmilliongypsies and go back to trolling / r/romania with slavic revisionism . 
  anyone who is a soviet apologist in the year 2013 , especially if they 're european , should have their guts torn out and eaten by komodo dragons .

   russia  european nope . 
  putin drinks cum . 
  where are you legendary integrating skills , france ? 
  ** where are they ? 
  ** you talked some ** ridiculous shit ** prior to us joining the eu . 
  accusing us of a bunch of hilarious bullshit , all the while blowing smoke up your own elven asses , talking about how you would do this and that if you were in our place . 
  then you barely get fucking 10 % of the gypsies we 've had to deal with for centuries and instantly change your tune . 
  and this has been going on for years now . 
  and you suck a fat dick at being racist too . 
  no proper racist would ever confuse romanians for gypsies , hitler did n't . 
  hey guys , what 's a rain ? 
  all hail the barrosic-luxemburgic-merkelian master race !, 
  the light comes from the ~ ~ east ~ ~ west !, 
   albanic substratum what about our english substratum , hmmmmmmmmmmm ? 
  there are plenty of * obvious * clues that the dacian language was heavily influenced by the english language and that the romanian people 's ethnogenesis occurred somewhere in the british isles . 
  the evidence is undeniable : * keep your eyes peeled - bele\u0219te ochii * hold your mouth - \u021aine-\u021bi gura * index finger - deget ar\u0103t\u0103tor * timely - timpuriu * to lose one 's mind - a-\u0219i pierde min\u021bile * to keep in mind - a \u021bine minte * last time - ultima dat\u0103 / oar\u0103 * being - fiin\u021b\u0103 * or - ori * otherwise - altminteri * tudor - tudor only a nationalist brute who wants to kill six million slavs would dare to deny this objective reality . 
   the raw anti-democratic nature of banning business as usual for the left . 
  that and the horrendous disregard for all life that communism instilled in these parts . 
  in the us , even the most leftist women see abortion as a terrible thing , that ca n't be said for the easter bloc . 
  an abortion is seen more or less as just another day at the office . 
  let 's not even talk about the appalling state of romanian healthcare , hospitals overrun by roaches , known butchers and killers practicing thanks to corrupt unions and the humongous and unnecessary risks women are taking . 
  the attitude alone is sickening . 
  great , folks are realizing that 2 peoples of different origins , names , customs and facial features are 2 peoples . 
  and it only took the better part of a decade . 
  well done , spain !, 
  civil society ? 
  in * my romania * ? 
  they 're slavs but not really slavs ? 
  to my knowledge , there 's a weird thing that happened between the indigenous thracian/romanian population , the original bulgarians which were turkic and came here from somewhere north of the caspian sea and the slavs . 
  that 's nothing compared to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lo9xh/russia_warns_moldova_over_its_proeurope_push/cc1nbxf?context=3 ) . 
  they were n't prisons , they were liberation camps maaaaaaaaaaan !, 
  why did n't they translate the best parts ? 
  does the west like uralic dick * that * much ? 
  translation :  if the so called pro european government from chisinau thinks that it can disregard the citizens ' opinion , especially those in transnistria , and become and eu associate , thus breaking the ** historical relations with its eastern neighbours ** ... what the actual fuck ? 
  ctrl + f romania , yep , here it is . 
  tell me , do you realize just how fucked up that sounds to the rest of the civilized world ? 
  they are a strong people who have always withstood slavic influence , culminating with its most savage incarnation so far , the ussr . 
  i salute you !, 
  relax guys , they were just liberating them . 
  less gypsies for us , the evil racists , more gypsies for them , the tolerant secular humanists . 
  everybody wins !, 
  why is it that whenever a small country does anything that directly benefits its * native indigenous overwhelming * majority , people cry nationalism ? 
  some believe it to be a cognate of english * ford * and latin * portus * . 
  as if anyone needs to resort to victimization/propaganda/fear mongering/scapegoating to make the general populace hate gypsies . 
  i 've always been areligious , but part of me wishes the christian legends were true if it would mean a hell where stalin 's souls is forever eaten by cockroaches .
