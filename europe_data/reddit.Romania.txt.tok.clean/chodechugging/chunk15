  romania could steal a page or two from * the lithuanian 's guide to approaching and discussing the issue of potential ties with surrounding slavic peoples * , namely the face bruising that will occur on the faces of those who might inquire about such ghastly things . 
  i do n't know why but for a country that has been 1984ed , lithuanians have always seemed proud and dignified . 
  they 're proud of their language , proud their heroes and of their role in fighting communism . 
  sadly , the polar opposite of what 's happening in romania right now . 
  can you guys like emigrate here or something ? 
   but everyone pronounced it gerianus huhuh huhuh uhuhu uh uhuuhuh heheh heh hehe hehehe ehe, 
  let 's see stephen fry write them an open letter , people paint rainbows in front of the turkish embassy , restaurants boycott turkish delight and henry rollins make stupid videos about it . 
  of course , you will never hear the legions of shrieking leftists address this in any way since turks are islamic brown people and islamic brown people are exempt from everything . 
  thy time is done , great ancient . 
  forever in shadow will you be , master of chaos !, 
  and to fade to nothingness in obscurity will be thy fate . 
  no , it just occurred to me that i have a spine . 
  well , typically great empires expanded like a liquid from the conquering people 's homeland outwards . 
  why do you think they went all the way to australia and india while never touching europe ? 
  something even russia dared to repeatedly do with moderate success . 
  they lost battles to enemies that were technologically inferior to a comical degree , like pelt wearing tribesmen armed with spears , simply due to the cretinous idea that one must fight `` honorably '' . 
  literally , they 'd stand still in a perfect straight line and fire their muskets as the aforementioned spear wielding tribesmen charged into them . 
  consequently , their empire building went rather poorly by empire building standards . 
  right now they 're harbouring lots of gypsies . 
  i like how they have a communist party . 
  i 'm sure many a eastern european feels just wonderful about this . 
  it 's all potato this pfff commoners that until asia decides to send one of its psychotic children into europe 's general direction and then all of the sudden we 're athleta christi . 
  but only temporarily , then we have aids again . 
  yes it is and it does n't seem to be getting any better . 
  because they 'd be flooded with 37845340675340 self hating romanian communist apologists crying nurrr hurrr hurrr nationalism/jews/gypsies / slavs/autonomy/stalin did nothing wrong/let me suck king michael 's dick until i die of dehydration !, 
  edit : ca n't way for * what do you know about romania ? 
  * , that 'll be a clusterfuck and a half . 
  those poor , poor russians . 
  man , you would think * even russia * would * eventually * get tired of being the earth 's gigacunt but no ... 
  the mockery was the fact that they even bothered with a formal trial , they should 've decapitated him on the spot . 
  instant death between a tree stump and a halberd is all communists deserve . 
  no beef in particular , it 's just that if something were to happen to any of the nearby slavs , romania and albania would be like [ i 'm ok with this ] ( http://pjmedia.com/tatler/files/2012/10/i_m_ok_with_this__n1296497202304__super.png ) . 
   i 'd like to ` reconquer ' the dalmatian islands and istria i 'm ok with this . 
  how is it ridiculous ? 
  in the hungarians ' situation , specifically those in romania that demand autonomy , you have to compare the amount of time that has passed from the other party 's ( in this case romanians ) emergence as a distinct people and their , the hungarians ' , subsequent arrival . 
  how much time has passed from their arrival to right now is kind of irrelevant . 
  it 's like that joke with the kid that thinks he 'll be the same age as his older brother once x amount of years pass . 
  sorry , reality does n't work that way . 
  and i have no double standards either . 
  everyone who has seen me discuss racial , ethnic or territorial subjects knows i 'm very nationalistic and have no sympathy for our neighbours . 
  yet , if the romanians south of the danube ever demanded autonomy , i would n't support it . 
  their arrived there long after the greeks , albanians and even the slavs were well established , so autonomy is out of the question . 
  they have an unusually high resistance to russians . 
  this pleases me greatly . 
   they should at least deprive him of his ~ ~ military pension ~ ~ head . 
  one of the things romania will have to do if it wants to become a real country again is renounce orthodox christianity . 
  having the same religion as the blood enemy ( russia ) is just not right . 
  it 's like having the same haircut as your parents ' murderer . 
  i propose we go back to shamanism and nature worship because it 's really metal . 
  rituals where you enter altered states of consciousness and believe you 've turned into a wolf , * that * will scare the hell out of the slavs . 
  i know they 'll never get transylvania again , i know that much . 
  alright then , if not antonescu , than what was it ? 
  name it . 
  remember what the king did when stalin rolled into basarabia , right ? 
  nothing . 
  remember what antonescu did afterwards after assuming direct control ? 
  razed russia to the ground along with the germans until his forceful removal . 
  so in light of these facts i 'll ask again . 
  what , in your opinion , if not antonescu , prevented romania from becoming a soviet province ? 
  it was n't right and it was n't wrong , it was an inevitable consequence of their repeated sabotage of the romanian state , army and people . 
  yeah , when you repay your host 's gratuitous benevolence by raiding their outposts , attacking their convoys and selling them to their enemy expect them to get very , very mad , homicidal even . 
  the * only * thing that kept romania from being another province in the ussr *** was *** antonescu . 
  the king would 've given stalin the whole country from the get go in a heartbeat . 
  king michael 's coup where he arrested antonescu , betrayed the axis and sided with the ussr . 
  hands down the most unforgivable moment . 
  prevent hungary from becoming a soviet republic in 1919 with 0 obligation , get treated like aids in return . 
  more often than not i feel like romania 's most grievous mistake was * not * siding with every eastern psychopath that came our way . 
  i would 've loved nothing more than to see that hammer and sickle britain and france love so much on top of the eiffel tower and up churchill 's stupid ass . 
  wow , sympathy for jews , gypsies * and * communists in a clean row , triple whammy . 
  well done , chaps . 
   the bill was partly sparked by annual pro-soviet rallies organized by the country 's large russian-speaking populace , and frowned upon by ethnic latvians after five decades of soviet occupation . 
   ** annual pro-soviet rallies ** should n't you guys make shark bait out of these fuckers already ? 
   dissecting i had other things in mind for the russian society in latvia , decapitation , impalement , things like that . 
  hey would n't it be funny if the wolf actually ate russia ? 
  that would be hysterical . 
  the imf drinks dog pee . 
  i agree with this . 
  are you saying you 're a nazi who wantstokillsixmillionslavs ? 
  can someone tell the romanian academia that the concept of pie exists ? 
  seriously , it 's a sickness at this point . 
  what is it with them and intermediates ? 
  no , an identical or nearly identical word in another language does * not * imply or even suggest a loan from that language , regardless of the 2 languages ' previous contacts . 
  latin * luna * and slavic * luna * for example , cognates with no connection apart from their common pie ancestry . 
  or english * man * and sanskrit * manu * , just because india was part of the british empire does not mean the latter was borrowed from the former , although romanian linguists would probably disagree , again , both cognates are unrelated apart from a very distant common ancestor . 
  is english * flutter * also an albanian loan ? 
  why not ? 
  anyway , a direct pie origin for all 3 words is obviously the most reasonable approach here . 
  or alternatively , if you ca n't accept that simply by virtue of being romanian and thus having a pathological yearning for intermediates , latin * fluctuare * seems like a good starting point for the romanian and albanian forms . 
  they 're pretty cool guys . 
  when analyzing the language you come across these incredibly frustrating mobius strips between albanian , romanian , greek , latin and sometimes the neighboring slavic languages . 
  someone needs to figure this stuff out real soon . 
  when you say nationalism you either mean cretinously tolerant policies , knee jerk reactions of dropping 1/3 of the territory like a hot potato to a plethora of eastern mongoloids and no sense of history or self respect or you must have unknowingly grown up in ciad . 
  i know it 's about god damn time they kicked the russians out , i know that . 
  shit , never thought i 'd say this , but well done hungary !, 
  the local community at best does n't care and is far too corrupted by its quivering and pathetic phobia of `` nationalism '' and `` xenophobia '' to say anything . 
   russia is hated as a state , but ethnic russians have hardly had any problems . 
  much to my displeasure . 
  i wonder how * this * is connected to wanting to kill 6 million jews . 
  i have a couple of things to say about that but i do n't want to be an armchair general . 
  i 'm just saying the us and the uk probably held more than enough sway over the whole thing to tell stalin to pack up and go home after germany was defeated .
