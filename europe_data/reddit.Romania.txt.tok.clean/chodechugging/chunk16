  this is , of course , in line with the official story according to which the ussr had no plans to invade europe in the first place . 
  he willingly gave half of europe away to stalin so he can go fuck himself with a pitchfork in the urethra . 
  is google blocked where these guys work or something ? 
   prevent yourself being called slavs if they had mixed up bulgaria with albania your head would 've rolled for that comment . 
  i wonder what would 've happened had it been the other way around . 
  one does not have to be hungarian in order to hungarian . 
  and i 'm not your brother . 
  son , do you know how fast you were hungarianing ? 
  anyone who can withstand russian corruption and maintain their identity , language and borders in the face of cancerous russification is my hero . 
  got ta love this line of thinking , * shit i ca n't say `` no gypsies '' that would be racist * , solution ? 
  say `` no eastern europeans '' and discriminate against fucking 10 times as many people , that 's secular and humanist . 
  well done guys !, 
  for the romanians reading this , remember when udrea said she felt like thatcher or wanted to be like thatcher or something ? 
  welp ... 
  toponymy is invariably a more convoluted side of linguistics , i would even argue for it being completely separate from it but that 's another story . 
  anyway , a lot of romanian toponyms ' proposed etymologies are shots in the dark and the alleged sources vary wildly depending on a lot of factors . 
  for example gala\u021bi is listed as being of cuman/slavic/celtic origin which is like saying you 're leaving on monday , wednsday or saturday , basically * pe strada larga ingusta se ducea un om venind si in tacerea lui profunda il auzeam bolborosind * . 
  and then there 's the confusion about who translated what from whom . 
  for romania : * act like a * people * not a * population * . 
  wait , does my constant hurling of invectives and threats of physical violence ( with a large poleaxe ) towards you have anything to do with these comments ? 
  talk about doing a 180 . 
  / r/linguistics and / r/fisting . 
  posting this here since you 'll never check your messages . 
  i found a serbian etymological dictionary and thought it might be relevant to your interest . 
  ctr + f * rum * for some surprises . 
  westerners never had to deal with eastern barbarians , the satiated do n't believe the hungry . 
   communism argues for ~ ~ a better world for everyone , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion ~ ~ overthrowing the current government by killing them and feeding them to dogs then proceeding to all but exterminate the general population as all semblance of civil society is obliterated , the elite is vanquished and the country is cursed with everlasting obscurantism . 
  fixed that for you . 
  i really doubt this will happen , but if does it will be a massive step in the right direction . 
  10 % of the battle would be won , 10 % of romania 's dignity would be regained . 
  bulgarian gypsies are what you would call criminals while romanian gypsies are a bunch of sad sons of bitches who 've seen one too many gangster films and decided to ( unsuccessfully ) emulate them , thus are much more likely to get caught than their brothers across the danube . 
  i ca n't really speak for estonia , latvia , lithuania and the differences between each state 's russian minority since i 'm completely unfamiliar with their situation . 
  your username is kinda relevant right now . 
  i 'm willing to bet anything that the `` romanians '' in question are in fact gypsies . 
  also , it would n't be at all surprising if the `` lithuanians '' turned out to be russians . 
  and i 'd like to add that i would love to see a small number of uk born africans make their way to , say , the balkans and see you guys lose your fucking shit whenever the press calls them british citizens . 
  * what 's this * ? 
  anti european movements !, 
  anti western attitudes !, 
  they 're clearly manipulated by russia !, 
  ex communists are still pulling the strings in the background !, 
  all the hail the luxembourgic-barroso-merkelian master race !, 
  i do n't recall romanians , southern slavs , greeks , etc. 
  making any incursions into india and buying slaves from the upper castes . 
  it 's not the protestant work ethic and it does not predate communism , it 's the same in all eastern bloc countries . 
  nowhere else on earth will you hear the phrase * work is a golden bracelet * uttered completely unironically . 
  we can still see red velvet through our tears . 
  i 've heard something about there being similar but less popular versions of it in albania and greece , can anyone clarify ? 
  dump a non specific amount of ground coffee in some boiling water , mix it for a few seconds , take one sip and dry heave from the horrid sourness and bitterness , pour into sink . 
  drink beer instead . 
  such is life in romania . 
  about the last part : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_%28grammar%29#variation_among_languages, 
  yeah no , those are zigeuner . 
  because romania is , to my knowledge , the only country on earth that does not give a fuck about its history , its heroes and ultimately itself . 
  others ' respect is strictly tied to self respect , and currently romania has none , not even vestigial self respect residue on the bottom of the basic human decency barrel , i 'm talking 0 . 
  source : i live here . 
  praise you , heroes !, 
  shut the fuck up faggot !, 
  you are utterly insane , and should be committed to an institution . 
  the same reason they stopped lynching blacks in the 60s , ** jesus fucking christ , are you serious ? 
  oh get the hell out of here with this garbage !, 
  yeah the virtually cosmopolitan cruelty and callousness specific to the 18th-19th century would 've continued in romania had it not been for communists !, 
  sure . 
  are you fucking retarded ? 
  do you see any slavery or civil war in the us today ? 
  do you see europe trying to colonize africa ? 
  do you see the church making any crusades or witch hunts ? 
  do you see australians still shooting aboriginals like animals ? 
  the only ones who are still rocking it that way today are , ironically , russia and israel . 
  you fucking idiot , you fucking apologetic scum sucker . 
  i hate you and everyone like you . 
  this is hilarious . 
  i bring up the fact that the elite was vanquished , an incommensurately damaging thing that romania may very well never recover from , an act so barbaric that its effects are still glaringly obvious today , romania being a `` village without dogs '' and you bring up the jews . 
  let me ask you this , if the `` children as young as 5 '' would 've been fed to dogs afterwards , would that have been alright ? 
  because that 's what communists did with tsar nicholas and his family . 
  all for the price of decapitating the romanian people as the elite was murdered and exiled . 
  a positive change indeed !, 
  i 'm the getting the feeling that it would 've passed had it not included communist symbols . 
  gon na have to call bullshit on this one , there 's no way the eastern bloc has more murders than france and the uk , now way . 
   is incredibly beautiful it 's 2013 , we can totally stop saying that . 
  no really , they ca n't hurt you anymore . 
  all i 'm seeing is * soon * . 
  [ here 's a joke of questionable taste that i made in another thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18kga1/meteorite_just_hit_this_zinc_plant_in_russia/c8fpe00?context=3 ) . 
  i will pin you down and lick your scalp until you shiver , pee and cry . 
  they are the majority in a ton of ghettos , and more importantly there are enough of them to potentially form a majority in a city and eventually a jude\u021b ( braila and galati come to mind ) should the idea of autonomy be brought to the table . 
  contrary to what you may think , they 're not stupid , they would jump at the opportunity to form a gypsy enclave . 
  it 's really easy to do : * take a train to wherever . 
  * whine about being oppressed . 
  * receive free housing . 
  * start terrorizing romanians . 
  * form no go zones . 
  * keep doing this for 10 years . 
  * achieve majority in a city . 
  * achieve majority in a jude\u021b . 
  * repeat . 
  i think our modus operandi is so fundamentally different from theirs that any parallels drawn between us and italy serve no purpose in this discussion . 
  even though antena 3 is a privately operated channel you have to realize it has a huge number of employees and it 's not a unitary structure . 
  there 's a massive divide between , say , their talk show producers and hosts , badea , gadea , etc. 
  and their news anchors . 
  the latter being considered simpleton plebeians by the former , and rightfully so , because they are .
