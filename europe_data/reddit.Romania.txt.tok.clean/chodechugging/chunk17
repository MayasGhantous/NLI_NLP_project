  now their `` it department '' is at the bottom of this ladder , they 're grossly incompetent and their only purpose is to post tabloid crap like that on their website in order to get more views from mongoloids . 
  i wo n't dismantle each one of your cretinous arguments for fear of getting a fatal stroke , but i will address this marvelous gem :  `` the constitution says we have a unitary state '' -- the constitution can be changed . 
  i do n't even know where to being but that 's * not * how constitutions work . 
  the constitution is not a wikipedia page everyone can edit to their hearts ' content . 
  if it were and it all came down to there being a sufficiently large number of people that want to change x or y then there would be no hungarians in romania simply because there 's a humongous number of people who are beyond sick and tired of their shit and would promptly descend into trasilvania with halberds of the sharpest steel and cleave them in half and then hurl their bodies across the romanian/hungarian border with trebuchets , not catapults , trebuchets . 
  fortunately for them , the constitution can not just * be changed * to account for whatever desires group x or minority y may have , that 's primitive tribalism and has no place in the 21st century . 
  oh and , can any historian punch him the face for this one ? 
   the area was n't inhabited by romanians before that but let me address the issue directly , without sifting through your rubbish , there can be no autonomy granted to any minority on romania 's territory since that would open the floodgates to every group and subgroup demanding the same . 
  that would mean we would have to give gypsies * the entire country * . 
  even though they have historically never been a majority in any area , never having the power to implement forceful assimilation , exile and genocide on romanians , unlike hungarians , they still comprise 3-4 % of the population and are distributed evenly across the country 's territory . 
  who 's to say that their tribes wo n't start demanding dozens of enclaves in the form of ghettos , sectors and eventually claim a jude\u021b as their own ? 
  who 's to say other minorities wo n't start doing the same ? 
  this is kind of uninteresting . 
  i 'd be more curios to see a list of unusual but still common names like romanian doru , from * dorul * , defined articulation of * dor * ( from latin * dolus * ) meaning longing or yearning . 
  like who names their kid * the longing * ? 
  [ my opinion can be found here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17l5od/prove_it_to_me_romania/c86xtwi ) . 
  this is ** exactly ** the kind of appallingly cretinous mindset that is keeping romania in the gutter . 
  appeal to the absolute lowest common denominator . 
  because that totally makes someone get in a fucking airplane and fly halfway across europe right ?!, 
  i mean , you get to go a place where you can * eat food * , * drink beer * , * ogle at tits * and * drive cars * *** on a road *** !, 
  no , i mean physical and psychological abuse . 
  i wonder what led you to * that * extrapolation . 
  i think you might wan na get that looked at . 
  what i was trying to say is that the shift back to * o * was silly and i 'd prefer the original * rum\u00e2n * for obvious reasons . 
  how to identify child abuse for dummies : 1 . 
  if it 's something you would n't do to an adult , either for fear of legal repercussions or simply because he might bust your stupid face then it 's abuse . 
  the end . 
  how does one go about latinizing a latin language ? 
  for your information , the * u * in * rum\u00e2n * and * rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 * reflect a latin * o * , o  u being one of the major phonetic changes that occurred from latin to vulgar latin/romanian . 
  it 's present in plenty of words , non  nu , nomen  nume , sonare  suna , ponere  pune and romanus  rum\u00e2n . 
  the * - esc * suffix is also inherited from latin so if anything * rom\u00e2n\u0103 * sounds less latin than * rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 * . 
  haha !, 
  i told you the us and canada will start singing the same song !, 
  [ this entire thread . 
  as a romanian , i can confirm this is 100 % true . 
  here are some other things that are claimed to be the results of the dreaded draft : * common cold * flu * rheumatism * otitis * pneumonia * chalazion * migranes * and my personal favorite , `` it makes this nerve in the back of your head swell '' . 
  do n't ask me what the fuck that actually means . 
  also , that article failed to mention several things . 
  people are also scared of the air flow coming from * under their doors * . 
  like the few millimeters of space between the door and the fucking floor , an opening so small an adult cockroach would have a hard time crawling though it , the air flow will kill the nerves in your feet or whatever . 
  i just lost iq points writing that down . 
  i 've seen people ( my grandma ) trying to * somehow * shove a long rag * between the closed door and the floor * to try and stop the air . 
  another troublesome thing is people dress their babies in beenies and jackets in the middle of july . 
  i 've seen babies mummified to such a degree they looked like jesus in a stroller , they literally could not rest their arms in the normal position because they had so many layers of clothing on . 
  their parents did n't even look poor or anything so they do n't have that excuse . 
  and this is during the month popularly called * cuptor * , oven . 
  i 've never wanted to cave in someone 's skull with my elbow so bad . 
  if only we would 've used our seemingly infinite resources of unfounded stubbornness to good use , like breaking stalingrad , we would 've been a different people . 
  i initially thought they were all telling the us to fuck off since they were the ones who pumped weapons and resources into the ussr thus contributing to their victory and subsequent catastrophic raping of eastern europe . 
  not being assimilated by the english is pretty hardcore . 
  of course i annexed moldova , what kind of question is that ? 
  [ and europe according to romania , well according to me anyway . 
  [ right back at them . 
  [ done . 
  i 'm on it . 
  edit : [ boom !, 
  it 's not just finland , western public schools are bastions of feminism . 
  it 's actually beastly hot and humid . 
  southern romania is ridiculous in july , it easily goes over 40 and nights are hot as balls . 
  you literally forget what it 's like to not feel uncomfortably hot . 
  i was being sarcastic , you silly geese . 
  wait , are you saying you want to kill 6 million jews ? 
  edit : what the hell man , not even shlomo jewenstein would say that . 
  it was clearly a sarcastic remark . 
  i 'm kinda disappointed in you guys . 
  uhhh ... no ? 
  i 'm not the vegetarian here , eryemil is . 
  your dodging skills are quite superb , anderson silva would be impressed . 
  i 'm talking about mainstream farming , breeding people to eat them , not axe murders . 
  come on bro , what 's a little cognitive ability got to do with it ? 
   i 'm a vegetarian as if that was n't glaringly obvious from you initial post . 
  so tell me then , where do you draw the line ? 
  can we eat people ? 
  they 're * very * accessible and if we ignore cognitive ability and all that they 're totally on the menu according to your logic . 
  no , you ca n't squirm out of the argument by pulling the i 'm vegetarian so i do n't know wubwubwubwubwub ~ ~ car ~ ~ card . 
  that is a succulent load of bullshit and everyone here knows it . 
  absolutely none of you advocating this mindset would ever think about eating , say , a chimp , not one of you . 
   sounds like you might be talking about homographs . 
  kind of an unfortunate mistake to make while pontificating about language . 
  comment edited . 
   latin-ness i believe you mean our ** francophilic ** period . 
   there are many documented instances when respected scholars have ignored obvious etymologies in favour of latin ones that were far less likely . 
  many of the `` obvious '' etymologies of romanian words are the result of balkanism , claiming the word is of slavic/turkish/hungarian / greek/albanian origin whenever a latin etymon can not be found , and especially when a cognate or homophone is present in our neighbours ' languages ( not that they actually need one since a lot of times fantasmagorical etymons from unattested proto-languages are shamelessly proposed ) , most of the times this is done completely disregarding meaning of either word . 
  which by the way , is what our neighbours do as well . 
  they 're `` obvious '' in the same sense that romanian * beat * and * fire * are `` obviously '' derived from their english ~ ~ homophones ~ ~ homographs , i.e. 
  an utterly ludicrous proposition . 
  this abhorrent `` earistic '' approach must die . 
  look out everyone , he might threaten to cut the gas again !, 
   thick - ~ ~ necked ~ ~ naped, 
  indeed , also latin * sclavus * retained its original meaning of slav in romanian as * \u0219chiau * . 
  also , the gyro joint on 1 mai ( 1st of may ) street in bucharest . 
  romania va invinge !, 
  that 's ridiculous , the main and only reason is that antonescu was romania 's last true leader and all of his successors were and are quivering blubbery vaginas , afraid of their own shadows . 
  everyone would rather let the last russian hobo come to his house and wipe his spent cock on his pillowcase rather than bring up moldova and risk getting accused by nooneov nobodyvici of being a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionrussians . 
  it 's been so long now it 's a bloated fucking joke to anyone with a brain , definitely in the top 5 things i hate about romania . 
  maybe on toast , i 'll give you that !, 
  these threads are always so depressing for romanians . 
  i was thinking of 2 things at the same time and my wires got crossed . 
  it also does n't belong on bread , you treacherous heathens !, 
  living in romania , i strongly dislike gypsies just as much as the next guy but you 're right , this video is bullshit .
