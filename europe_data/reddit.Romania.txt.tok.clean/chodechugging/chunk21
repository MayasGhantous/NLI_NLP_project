  whereas you will wo n't even hear the faintest blast of a stray shell somewhere in the distance ? 
  you got a lot of fucking balls calling me , a romanian , a desktop hero . 
   preferably something that does not end in ww3 and in more dead ukrainians . 
  that ship has sailed months ago . 
  the only possible resolution now is a violent one . 
  and the more the west waits and grovels , the more violent it will be . 
  merkel literally saying she wants to work with russia , not against it . 
  merkel saying the `` solution '' to the ukraine war must not upset russia . 
  merkel giving russia a plethora of options , including offering putin a * free trade agreement * . 
  ** literally trying to reward russian aggression ** . 
  continuing to talk with putin , to meet with him in the flesh , legitimizing him and his war and her outright refusal to declare ** one single fucking russian official ** as persona non grata . 
  not even the obviously crazy ones like rogozin or that other asshole . 
  even as russian tanks were pouring into ukraine while she was groveling at putin 's feet in minsk . 
  also , her outright refusal to arm ukraine . 
  is that good enough ? 
  merkel literally said that she hopes to work with russia not against it . 
  legitimizing and enabling russian aggression and warfare in europe seems to be what the eu wants so why not sell them weapons ? 
  his kidnapping entailed russian military breaching the nato border . 
  just a reminder . 
  latvia has almost no fighting capabilities , calling for their cooperation does n't really ... mean anything . 
  the ball is entirely in the west 's court here . 
  what they should have said is :  nato must work with its allies and must be prepared at the first appearance of ``' little men ' without designations on the uniforms '' to fight . 
  no delay is possible . 
  saying `` latvia must ... '' is basically hinting that the west will continue to allow and legitimize russian aggression . 
   latvia must work with its allies and must be prepared at the first appearance of ``' little men ' without designations on the uniforms '' to fight . 
  no delay is possible . 
  i like how they 're almost preemptively blaming latvia for the upcoming invasion . 
  nato wo n't even look at russia without their permission , do n't hold your breath . 
  it will go something like this :  there is only one solution to rebuilding nato 's credibility and that is a diplomatic one . 
  mr putin has discredited it by `` supporting separatist movements '' , we must not reply in the same tone . 
  we must show that out values are peaceful . 
  we must show that our values are tolerant . 
  we must that out values are humane . 
  we can not , and will not , allow ourselves to be dragged down into a conflict that benefits no one . 
  we must consult with our russian partners and agree on a road to deescalation ^ tm . 
  we must get all parties on the road map to peace ^ tm or else all that we 've strived to accomplish in europe , the democracy , the peace , the unity , will be perilously hanging in the balance . 
  believe me , the events that will soon transpire will bring me much more than ten seconds of primal satisfaction . 
  yes because ukraine invaded russia , several times , deported thousands of russians to siberia , shifted the ukrainian-russian border entire kilometers east , pursued a relentless campaign of cultural annihilation against the russia people , nearly committed actual genocide against the russians and has had russian vassals for decades who toil on imposing ukraine 's will and encroaching on the russian people . 
  this is pure garbage . 
  revolting russophilic shit . 
  kissing russia 's uralic ass through the thinnest of handkerchiefs . 
  shame on you . 
  too bad , we 're getting war either way . 
  yes , the reason is they 're russian planes . 
  if those were indian or pakistani jets , they would 've been scrap metal ages ago . 
  there is literally * no reason * to not shoot them down . 
  this is a declaration of war and should be dealt with accordingly . 
  godspeed , my very very very distant brothers !, 
  hopefully romania will meet you half way some time in the distant future . 
  should n't they be focusing on catching people who are physically fucking children first ? 
  because moldova was part of romania and was torn from it and later became a separate state as a direct consequence of russian aggression . 
  so referring to romania and moldova as 2 distinct territories more or less validates ( or whatever the word is ) said aggression and those who may not be familiar with the whole situation might get the false idea that they 've always been 2 separate entities . 
  as a romanian , the sun can suck my dick . 
  i 've had the back of skull relentlessly fucked by sunlight from june to october and almost died several times from the monstrous humidity and 45 degree heat . 
  saying romania and moldova is a tad redundant . 
  also , albania is the third non slavic country in the east . 
  does anyone know why the west keeps taking various fringe tribal societies ' ( russia , china ) `` threats '' even half seriously ? 
  enslaving people though debt by having your vassals vacuum imf loans is also like a virus , warns every non anglo-saxon ever . 
  most people in the eastern parts of europe are all to familiar with this already . 
  i mean , i live in a house that is at least 96 years old and at night it can drop to like 8 degrees easily . 
  it is n't even a country , it 's a tribe . 
  that type of `` reasoning '' is a tell tale sign of sociopathy . 
  did n't lenin say something to the effect of `` the only way to govern a pack of brutes ( russians ) is by force '' ? 
  that 's by no means en exact quote , but i think that 's the gist of what he was saying . 
  disclaimer : i do not subscribe to the ideas of communism or lenin 's catastrophic attempts to implement it and sincerely hope that he 's playing get raped with a white hot shovel in hell . 
   alienate russia even more from the civilized world first of all , * russia * and * civilized world * should never be mentioned in the same sentence . 
  and ** further ** alienating russia from * any * aspect of the civilized world is practically impossible . 
  wow , is portugal secretly romania or something ? 
  as a romanian atheist i have to say that religion has nothing to do with this . 
  we could stick all the crosses up every priest 's ass and education would stay the same because it 's purely a mentality issue . 
  no amount of money can fix it until we get rid of the why if ceausescu was here asshole teachers and the corrupt unions that make them impossible to fire . 
   russia ... human rights yeah no . 
  preemptive strike against stupid posts :  they 're specifically against gay marriage , not gay or otherwise `` deviant '' sexual practices . 
  and even as a lifelong atheist i can totally understand why . 
  in christian mythology , the rite of marriage is fundamentally and exclusively based on a male-female relationship . 
  this may not be obvious to someone living in a country where catholic christianity is prevalent , but in orthodox christianity there is a very heavy emphasis put on the strict male-female nature of the marriage rite . 
  as in , at a wedding the priest will spend the better part of an hour chanting mostly about the complementary nature of the male-female relationship and how the importance it has when it comes to establishing a household/family . 
  here on the eastern europe it 's common knowledge that it 's a thing that no one has a say in . 
  to ask for marriage between persons of the same sex to become mainstream is like asking for babies to be baptized in maple syrup or for people to be buried under an intersection . 
  there 's nothing inherently or objectively wrong about it , however , it is ultimately a desecration of a basic christian rite . 
  which is the entire point and the only reason to undergo a rite , the rite itself in its entirety . 
  when you deviate from an aspect so fundamental , the very core of the rite , the male-female relationship , marriage becomes null and void . 
  which begs the burning question , why do gays suddenly love christianity so much ? 
  it 's all `` smash patriarchy '' this , `` die cis scum '' that , until we get to marriage and then they do a 180 . 
  now the church is cool for some reason . 
  why would you , as a gay person , want to partake in anything that stands under the banner of christianity ? 
  why is christianity all of the sudden the gatekeeper to your happiness ? 
  i 'm gon na assume that most gays are not religious , so why are they so attached to the idea of undergoing a ritual in a christian place of worship , during which scriptures from christian mythology are recited ? 
  i have one or two good answers , but will not mention then here for the sake of keeping the discussion civil . 
  look , no one is stopping you making your own creed out of thin air and making it mainstream . 
  just look at mormonism . 
  believe it or not , no one is stopping you from establishing homosexualism as a mainstream thing . 
  you could make up your ouw ceremonies and everything , have the priests sing elton john songs , the whole deal . 
  which , assuming that you are truly a homosexual , would make you just as happy since you never wanted to appeal to straight people anyway . 
  i 'm stealing this . 
  i ca n't ever see this going awry , nope , not at all . 
  hmmmmmmmmmm, 
  how ? 
   if we stopped ~ ~ paying ~ ~ trying to enslave them by having our vassals guzzle imf loans that they ca n't pay back in a million years . 
  i think you may be on the right track there .
