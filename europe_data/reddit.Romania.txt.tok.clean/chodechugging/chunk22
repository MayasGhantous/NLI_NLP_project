  you 'd be surprised how much nicer greeks would be if the eu would just stop trying to turn greece into a pashalik . 
  hey man , you can call them zigeuner . 
  whatever , fella . 
  just try not to send them back to the east again when this fails . 
  no really , do n't do it !, 
  there 's no such thing as roma or sinti , they 've always called themselves ** tigan/ciganin/zingaro / zigeuner/gitano/cingerne / \u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ** . 
   since 2007 there have been in spain about 375000 evictions . 
  merkel is so moist right now . 
  i 've never seen an italian player jump kick or sweep another player 's legs while the ball is all the way in the other half of the field .

  russia should have certain restrictions regarding weapon production and things like that . 
  and they most definitely should n't have nukes . 
  if there 's one country that should never ever have nukes , it 's russia . 
   not something that can be found in our dna . 
  i do believe it can be found in our dna quite definitively . 
  you mean 12 eu countries who are hitlerandwanttokillsixmillionjews ? 
  pfff , fucking madagascar would stand a better chance of joining . 
  son , do you know how fast you were hungarianing ? 
  man i do n't know but dutch soccer players are the most unsportsmanlike organisms in the world . 
   russians ... doing good . 
  you 're a funny guy !, 
   even though their cultures are closer to nearby muslim countries this is hilarious . 
  the west is full mosques and no go zones which will soon by under sharia law and * we * are closer to them ? 
  closer how ? 
  i 'm romanian and i 've never seen a mosque or a burka in real life . 
  like what are you even talking about ? 
  closer because intolerance , what does that even mean ? 
  muslims have a hard time with the whole tolerance thing even amongst themselves , the shi'a -- sunni situation , treating their women like garbage , etc. 
  their way of life , which they are ever so feverishly eager to bring to the west , would be considered barbaric when put side by side with pretty much anything , even russia , * even russia * . 
  contrary to what you may think , most people over here * do * in fact realize that no all muslims are walking around with explosives in their underpants , probably more so than any westerner actually . 
  * however * , due to the sheer number of such occurrences , * people just do n't like them * . 
  imagine that !, 
  yes , westerners , that is a thing you can totally do . 
  this is probably hard to understand for someone who lives in the west or god forbid , the us , but eastern europe , the baltic area and the balkan peninsula are in fact some of the safest places on earth . 
  ok , the slavs are a bit squirrely in that regard but still , the tigans mostly keep the killing amongst themselves and generally speaking no one has guns so the worst thing that can happen to you is spending the night at the hospital and maybe a chipped tooth . 
  speaking of intolerance and stereotypes , contrary to what you may have heard , these parts are very boring and uneventful . 
  organized crime is very low when compared to anything in the west , no one does any drugs , no serial killers , no assassinations and the people are by large phlegmatic and morose . 
  again , slavs * might * have something to say about that . 
  now compare that to the cult of islam . 
  you can waste your breath all you want trying to convince us that not all muslims are suicide bombing , clitoris cutting , stone throwing , acid throwing , honor killing asshats , but the fact remains that these things * never * happen over here , ever . 
  or at least have not happened for hundreds and hundreds of years so to an eastern european muslims look like monsters . 
  let 's not even talk about the fact that this radical murderous `` minority '' seems to be humongous , news about muslim atrocities are commonplace . 
  yes , i 'm aware that while the number of fundamentalists is probably in the hundreds of thousands , they still comprise a very small percentage of the global muslim population . 
  however , that does n't change the fact that there are still full blown legions of people who are willing to bury someone chest deep and crack their skull open with rocks because * they 've been raped * . 
  you know how many stonings happened in romania this year ? 
  none , same as the year before and the year before that . 
  jesus , do i need to go on ? 
  oh yeah , we also do n't like them because the ottoman empire was a huge cunt , there . 
  like mutilating your children so they do n't get taken away to be used as sex slaves is really not cool at all . 
  all over the place , even in piata victoriei . 
  if you look closely at that big apartment building across the street from the antipa museum , the one with lots of billboard ads on top , you can see a small cluster of holes next to a window that looks like machine gun fire . 
  i expect at least a couple of retarded comments about how it was n't a `` real revolution '' , sadly these will likely come from romanians , so i 'm just gon na say this : by now it 's no secret that the rebellion was sparked by foreign agent provocateurs , * however * , real romanians rebelled for real and got shot with real bullets and got crushed by real armored transport vehicles and real tanks for real . 
  you can still see plenty of real holes made by real bullets in real buildings all over bucharest so let 's stop with the bullshit . 
  yeah ... so / r/europe is basically / r/anglosaxons . 
   sadism [ yeah , basically russia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12bz24/poland_found_explosives_on_wreckage_of_presidents/c6txqr9 ) . 
  germany implemented this policy some time ago where it was illegal for any german press written and published by non germans to be written in the german language . 
  i ca n't quite remember who came who came up with it though . 
  i was gon na say there 's no way in hell this poll takes eastern europe into account . 
  romney admitted loud and clear that russia is the west 's largest geopolitical enemy so i think he would do quite well over here . 
  [ moonshine . 
  ] ( http://www.rhomania.com/portals/155725/images/tuica%20guy.jpg ), 
  by now it 's more or less common knowledge that the black sea used to be a fresh water lake in the very distant past , only becoming connected to the mediterranean sea and the world ocean when the mediterranean spilled into it . 
  this probably doubled its volume and the water swallowed whatever was going on back then . 
  efforts should be made to organize some underwater excavations , too bad our compatriots and our neighbors only care about soccer and moonshine . 
   he says looting is so rampant and chaotic that the criminals themselves have driven the prices so low it actually makes zero sense for them economically . 
  that 's so eastern european . 
  they also found the oldest knows copper tools somewhere in serbia . 
  also the [ tartaria tablets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c4%83rt%c4%83ria_tablets ) were found in transilvania , romania . 
  unless they massively screwed up the carbon dating , these tablets are oldest known examples of writing on earth . 
  they predate both sumerian and egyptian scripts/hieroglyphs . 
  unintelligible ? 
  romanian and aromanian are mutually more intelligible than most * accents * of the same language . 
  take a man from alabama and a man from wales , their accents/dialects are less distant then romanian and aromanian and yet i guarantee you they will have an awful hard time having a conversation without slowing down . 
  whereas i easily understood 90 % of what she was saying in that song . 
  i would n't call that unintelligible . 
  the same can be said for istro romanian and megleno romanian . 
  i think that europe , at least the eastern half , would rather ally with satan . 
  kinda shocked that bergman is n't mentioned . 
  you * have * to see hour of the wolf , winter light and the shame . 
  i know everyone has a meter long boner for the seventh seal and persona but i found the aforementioned films to be just as good if not better . 
  also , hour of the wolf captures liv ullmann 's godly face like no other film . 
  anything by bela tarr , werckmeister harmonies is the * shit * . 
  [ the cremator ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063633/ ) because ... just watch it . 
  * it 's not an anti german film i swear * . 
  [ man bites dog ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103905/ ) for the blackest humor ever . 
  [ taxidermia ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410730/ ) and [ delicatessen ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/ ) for * really * disgusting humor . 
  and i have to recommend irreversible , look , despite the rape and that other scene it 's really not a gore flick . 
   `` i was walking my dog on a leash on sibiu street in drumul taberei . 
  i was accosted by 3 dog catchers who wanted to take my dog , a stray i adopted 3 years ago . 
  i dropped the leash , the dog catchers attacked me with their lassos , they shoved me and i fell down . 
  i sustained trauma to my hands and spine . 
  the dog catchers caught my dog and locked it up . 
  someone called the cops , they got here relatively quickly and the dog catchers released my dog '' , tells a woman living in the 6th sector of the capital . 
   caterina mororoiu , 32 , claims to have been attacked this afternoon by dog catchers while walking her dog , a stray she adopted 3 years ago , according to adevarul.ro . 
   inml ( national forensic institute ? ), 
  employees confirmed that the woman arrived there this evening . 
  `` i will press charges saturday morning '' said caterina mororoiu . 
  also , the woman refused to go to the hospital for medical attention after leaving the institute this evening . 
  `` everyone around her was screaming * you criminal , you criminal , you 're feeding the dogs * ! '', 
  said the woman 's sister .
