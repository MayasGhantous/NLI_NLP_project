  that 's treason . 
   if you want to obama to literally give alaska to russia or sell them an aircraft carrier before you call him a traitor , you 're missing the point . 
  what did you think was gon na happen ? 
  ukrainians waited for weeks hoping that someone would so something . 
  they willingly gave up part of their country to a foreign invader in the hopes that such an extreme act might trigger international outrage and several external forces would lend them a hand . 
  instead they got * praised * for being `` pacifist '' , * praised * for conceding to a foreign aggressor and * praised * for allowing their borders to be violated and their dignity to be smashed . 
  the west 's pathetic lack or reaction and their eager guzzling of uralic semen ( figuratively speaking , of course ) showed ukrainians exactly what the world thinks about them and where they stand ; completely alone . 
  to everyone getting their panties in a bunch over this , fuck you . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  where was your outage when people were getting shot by russian snipers in maidan ? 
  where was your outrage when crimea was annexed ? 
  where was your outrage when donetsk `` declared independence '' ? 
  just 1000 people protesting for like a week in front of the white house would 've shamed obama into mobilizing some nato troops to kiev . 
  1000 turks protesting would 've shamed turkey into closing the bosporus . 
  1000 people protesting in any european country would 've shamed the european side of nato into sending `` peacekeeping troops '' to ukraine . 
  what did you think was gon na happen ? 
  ukrainians bending over and allowing russia to trample them like a bunch of stick eating dirt people ? 
  the main reason for this is the people getting arrested are more often than not the president 's opponents and they 're not getting tried and sentenced for their alleged crimes , which i 'm sure many of them are guilty of perpetrating , but instead for their political affiliation . 
  this is how ceausescu and communist leaders in general operated . 
  president basescu himself being as red as they come , in the 80s he was working abroad as the representative of the socialist republic of romania at antwerp . 
  think about that . 
  working on the other side of the iron curtain , * as the country 's official representative * , forget about the party , the security , ceausescu himself must have personally liked this guy a lot . 
  by the way , basescu is involved in * at least * 3 cases that would land just about anyone in prison for life , especially a president . 
  the fleet case , the mihaileanu house case and the basescu-casuneanu case . 
  none of which have been investigated by the `` independent justice system '' . 
  which has also `` mysteriously '' spared elena udrea , basescu 's ... associate , in the bute case as well as many of his other associates . 
  i said `` at least '' because , despite being very politically active during the communist regime , basescu 's security file is nowhere to be found . 
  but chodechugging it does n't matter what he did he 's the only one putting corrupt people in prison derp !, 
  ! 111 imagine if the head of the child protective services was a known pedophile . 
  i mean a kid fucker 's kid fucker . 
  he fucked kids in the ass , several times , for decades . 
  how crooked would the logic in your brain have to be to support him ? 
  or imagine if your chief of police was a known murderer . 
  like a full blown ted bundy/jeffrey dhamer psychopath , a monster . 
  welp ca n't arrest him he 's the chief of police there 'd be no police without him huuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !, 
  ca n't believe this fucking thread , jesus christ !, 
  what do you mean by long run ? 
  russia is at war with ukraine and if [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/26tlqn/4500_russian_fighters_have_crossed_the_ukraine/ ) then kiev will fall by the end of next week . 
  then the whole song and dance about `` local pro-russian forces '' will start manifesting in moldova and i feel like i should n't have to explain why that will be catastrophic . 
  europe , the eu and nato do n't even have a secure border . 
  talking about advanced ideas like european ties is pointless as long as anyone can literally walk into europe and the people in charge are still at the * war is icky * stage . 
  i do n't see how we ( me and you ) wo n't be at war very shortly . 
  people are sick and tired of the double standards and hypocrisy that practically define the eu . 
  before we joined they kept telling us to stop oppressing gypsies and then spazzed out when the borders opened and they got like 10 % of the gypsies we 've been dealing with since forever . 
  after all their disgustingly self-serving guilt trips and inane speeches , the whole integration thing is n't looking too good on their end . 
  at least there 's no one to screech in * their * ear whenever they burn some gypsy cams down and deport them back here now and again . 
  also , as far as they 're concerned , all romanians are gypsies now . 
  but it 's ok , the western states are totally not racist . 
  or take the schengen area , romania is not in it despite being a nato member . 
  they told us our borders are n't secure enough . 
  which is n't a surprise since their vassal ( our president ) has done literally nothing for the past 10 years he 's been in office except jail his political opponents . 
  even that would 've been cool as long as they would 've taken * a * measure , a single one , to buff our border . 
  if you 're gon na be authoritarian be authoritarian , tell your slave to make your province strong . 
  it 's in * your * interest to have a tight border . 
  if he ca n't , remove him or buff it yourself . 
  if he 's not your slave then do n't bail him out of impeachment when 7 million people vote for it . 
  if you 're * that * concerned with supposed pro-russian people getting into power , start with hungary , where it has already happened . 
  it just goes on and on . 
  do you guys have any idea how bad transnistria will look in a few weeks ? 
  i sure hope that by * explain * he means war . 
  it would be less painful than listening to him actually talk . 
  get a tongue frenulum , christ . 
   `` they considered sending interceptor planes '' , rogozin added . 
  it 's a shame they did n't . 
  we could 've taken the chance to reignite our [ historical relations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lo9xh/russia_warns_moldova_over_its_proeurope_push/cc1nbxf ) . 
  behold our [ might ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tidal_wave ) , indeed . 
  i think the rule of thumb is putin communicates with his troops and their local thugs directly , privately . 
  anything he says publicly is for the rest of the world , there are no russian troops in ukraine , we wo n't annex crimea , we 've pulled the troops back from the border , etc. 
  all lies , he just says what the world wants to hear . 
  he only speaks the truth publicly post factum . 
  i would feel disappointed . 
  nato should force its members to arm themselves in a more material , practical fashion . 
  their eastern members most of all . 
  there should be a chart of required armament , general gear and training regiments that all members should conform to . 
  like , you need this many tanks , that many jets and your troops should be able to do x , y and z. 
  monthly joint exercises should also be mandatory , especially here in the east . 
  bigger western states should extensively train smaller ones and smaller ones should train with each other as long as their racial/historical/ethnic / linguistic state of affairs will permit it . 
  a romanian-albanian drill would be preferable to a romanian-hungarian drill , a greek-romanian one preferable to a greek-turkish one , etc. 
  this should be happening at least 6 times per year for every eastern member . 
  that would be the only way to make sure we are n't a liability for nato and to ensure their support when our borders get violated by russia again . 
  unfortunately , it 's too late now . 
  i do n't see how nato will rush to the defense of states whose only military potency consists of guerilla warfare and s&d . i 'm sure i 'm not the only one who would feel utterly unsurprised if nato drops us as soon as russia takes chisinau . 
  yes , living under communism is like living in an eyehategod album . 
  i predicted this is the path russia would choose [ 2 months ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1z5sr3/russian_troops_took_control_over_airports_in/cfr2eab?context=3 ) . 
  for those who do n't know what the area looks like , [ here ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=45.966425,31.261597&amp;spn=2.901844,4.938354&amp;t=h&amp;z=8 ) , there 's odessa , there 's the nistru 's mouth to the left . 
  that chuck of ukraine between moldova and romania is gon na see a lot of action very soon . 
  putin will enter moldova through its southern border while simultaneously taunting romania from across the danube . 
  we 're gon na start hearing the terms ukrainian/northern bank and romanian/southern bank a lot . 
  going through moldova 's southern border as opposed to its eastern one also makes sense since chisinau can be reached much easier that way than from kiev . 
  and finally , an entrance through the southern border is preferable because putin can just take one more step from odessa and cross the nistru on `` ukrainian '' territory , avoiding the gymnastics of going through transnistria and the real danger of entering moldova by crossing a body of water and his mongs getting killed . 
  by the way , expect obama and breedlove to remain perfectly oblivious to all of this . 
  i 've been thinking a lot about the same thing op proposes but yeah , those maps are * out there * . 
  i stared at the screen for 10 minutes and the best i could come up with , for the east , that would n't immediately insult more than 2 countries , never mind it actually being feasible , is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u2bimci.png?1 ) . 
  obama laughed too . 
  yes , the eu keeps tabs on their funds . 
  sooner or later they would ask us where the money went . 
  since things like stray dog shelters with 6 figure price tags ( funneling 90 % of any given fund ) are a common occurrence in romania , it would be really jarring and obvious . 
  even though there 's no one on reddit that hates russia and russians more than i do , i have to say that most of the claims they made about romania , except the nonsense about nuclear missiles , are mostly true . 
  joining the eu has had little positive effect on romania . 
  apart from small things like cheaper food ( yes , it 's a very small thing from where we 're sitting right now ) , joining the eu has done next to nothing as far as vital things like infrastructure , rule of law , healthcare , defense , political climate , disavowing communism and especially people 's mentality .
