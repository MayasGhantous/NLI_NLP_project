  because moldova is not in nato and romania brought this onto itself by being the `` aggressor '' . 
  it does n't even matter , hostile russian troops would be present on nato territory with no repercussions . 
  the circumstances of both the russian troops ' presence in nato territory and nato 's inaction are ultimately unimportant , what 's important is a precedent would have been firmly set . 
  that would be the perfect stepping stone putin needs to attack estonia . 
  not that he needs it that badly . 
  to me , nato is all but defunct . 
  the european side has shown ... let 's not even talk about that . 
  and obama just showed putin [ his vagina ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/20usfd/president_obama_no_us_military_action_in_ukraine/ ) . 
  call me crazy , but anyone issuing these statements does n't strike me as the kind of person that would go from 0 to full blown war if the known aggressor were to move a couple of hundred kilometers into another country `` not worth starting ww3 over '' . 
  nato has no track record and it has n't set any precedents . 
  i do n't think obama is prepared to act . 
  and putin knows it . 
  come on , i was writing a reply to your deleted comment . 
  http://i.imgur.com/9r0tner.png?1 the reply : it 's people like me who prevented [ calamity in 1919 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian%e2%80%93romanian_war ) hungary becoming a soviet republic ( the first one , after russia itself ) in 1919 would 've been nothing short of a global catastrophe . 
  and if you know anything about anything you know that romania could 've easily stood idle just like the glorious west . 
  in fact , hungary losing its elite , its culture and its future in 1919 would 've brought great joy to many a romanian , myself included . 
  for people like me , `` reals '' supersede `` feels '' . 
  you ca n't let things like short-term personal satisfactions or morals that are indeed integral to a peaceful society stand in your way when facing an enemy like russia . 
  they are a planetary threat , they do not respect anything , except people that physically kill them . 
  their last century is defined by systematic murder , systematic destruction of a wide variety of different peoples ' future and relentless expansion . 
  any martial action , be it nuclear , chemical or medieval is fully justified when dealing with them . 
  i agree , deporting them is wrong . 
  i was thinking about impalement myself . 
  this is how , banking on your apathetic and defeatist attitude to exponentially erode the us ' sphere of influence with salami tactics until russia amasses too much territory , too many resources and too much manpower . 
  it will snowball and become unstoppable if left unchecked . 
  invasion of the us would probably be the final step in a long series of events starting with the forceful shrinking of its military via sanctions and blackmailing and ending with the de facto annexation of cuba , greenland and parts of canada . 
  trust me when i say , i know exactly how russians think , this is all very possible . 
  because russia 's target is not ukraine or romania , it 's ultimately the us . 
  being an edgy libertarian does n't change that . 
  the upcoming war will almost certainly affect me directly since i live next door . 
  i will most likely enlist ~ ~ if ~ ~ when moldova gets attacked . 
   i believe we should be helping train the ukrainian military , i believe we should be funneling supplies into them , whether it be rations , manpads , tanks , ammo or javelin anti-armor missiles ; i believe we should be providing as much real-time intelligence to the ukrainian military as possible , satellite images of russian military movements , communications intercepts that window for that is about to close though , as soon as putin annexes all of ukraine . 
  it 's `` funny '' because nato was scared to support ukrainians even before russian invasion . 
  i do n't see how anyone is gon na do it now , with russian troops there and full annexation just around the corner . 
  by the way , your fear of war is exactly what putin wants , it 's the thing that allowed him to annex crimea and i wager it 'll allow him to touch nato territory very soon . 
  russia annexing part of ukraine is , among other things , immediately against us interest . 
  every second the us spends not addressing the issue directly , either by sending a fleet to the black sea , deploying drones or even ground troops around crimea , is a brick removed from its foundation . 
  the time for war * games * is over . 
  russia invaded a sovereign state , do you think they 're gon na be impressed by posturing ? 
  posturing that takes place near the * baltic sea * , a place that 's often times far away from ukraine ? 
  this would 've been an effective deterrent * before the invasion of ukraine * . 
  unfortunately , that idea was shot down by virtually everyone because it would 've `` started ww3 '' . 
  well , look where that got us . 
  now i say , send a disproportionately large amount of troops to western ukraine and the black sea , give putin an ultimatum , demand complete retreat of any and all russian military personnel from the area , issue warnings to civilians to vacate crimea , drown it in napalm if he fails to comply . 
  ukraine not being in nato is no excuse for allowing russia to do whatever it wants . 
  ukraine ? 
  the country russia has actually invaded . 
  russia has annexed part of ukraine , let 's send troops to ... the baltic states ? 
  at what point could obama 's excessively permissive foreign policy be regarded as treason ? 
  i 'm glad everybody is feeling so good about themselves . 
  nothing will happen because like it would be totally outrageous if it did !, 
  romania will explode with anger if that happens though . 
  massive protests demanding war will materialize over night . 
  the approval and recognition of all forms of government will drop to 0 if our leaders will hesitate . 
  the prut is getting crossed one way or the other if russia attacks moldova . 
  nato does n't mean anything . 
  it 's not like there 's an autonomous giant robot called nato that gets turned on ready for battle as soon as russia attacks a member . 
  nato is comprised of ** people ** and it 's very susceptible to their whims , their doubts and their fears . 
  triggers do n't pull themselves , missiles do n't launch themselves , planes do n't fly themselves . 
  just sitting there doing nothing and telling yourself that if russia touches nato territory some divine retaliation will spontaneously materialize out of the ether is an ** extremely ** dangerous attitude . 
  nato military action is entirely dependent on its people 's willingness to act . 
  if you have seen anything to suggest that this willingness exists at all , tell me what it is , because all i 've seen is yellow , blubbery cowardice . 
  nato does n't even have a reputation or a track record behind it , russia does . 
  they 're the 20th century 's biggest terrorists and savages , i do n't think putin is believes in nato . 
  when latvia or romania get attacked , nato will buckle because it 's run by cowards . 
  sure , nato will cease to exist , i firmly believe that the people behind it are willing to throw the whole thing in the trash if it means keeping their own asses out of the hot seat . 
  and if that 's not true , it 's already too late to change their image . 
  good , if act like a completely impotent and useless coward , prepared to be treated like one . 
  fuck the eu . 
  i was watching [ the cremator ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063633/ ) and about halfway through i thought czech does n't really `` sound slavic '' ? 
  it sounded very posh and clean , a polar opposite to the muddy , scabby sounds you hear in russian . 
   no war with russia i disagree , i think a war would heal the romanian post-communist mentality for good . 
  plus * war with russia * !, 
  revenge for stalin 's crimes is a must if we ever hope to evolve as a people . 
  indeed , american military intervention became imperative the second russian forces entered ukraine . 
  europe had the chance to cut off a finger , intervene themselves before protesters started dying . 
  the us had the chance to cut off a hand , intervene within hours of russian invasion . 
  now they 're gon na have to cut off a whole arm . 
  the more they wait , the more the infection progresses , the more they 're gon na have to cut off in the end . 
  direct war between the us and russia is guaranteed . 
  there 's no other way out of this . 
  the ramifications of allowing russia free annexation of a sovereign neighbor are insane , the seeds it plants will grow into direct threats to the us . 
  the only question is how many positions will putin be allowed to secure before it starts . 
  this is the 21st century 's icon of cowardice so far . 
  i would 've expected them to at least do something so save their own faces . 
  it 's hilariously late for sanctions anyway , just impose them as a formality so you get to be like * don ' ever say i never gave ya nuttin ' * to eastern europe for the next 100 years . 
  if eastern countries do n't start leaving the eu in the next 5 years i 'll be surprised . 
  romania 's leadership is very weak the moment . 
  no statement issued by anyone would be taken seriously . 
  although any move on moldova would mean instant civil war . 
  `` fortunately '' for us , there has been fuckall done to counter russian expansion so they probably have bigger targets in mind , hence the troop movement in kaliningrad . 
  for real though , yesterday i though moldova might be next . 
  but after seeing how watery nato , the us basically , has been i 'm beginning to think that moldova might be too small of a target . 
  if they attack latvia or moldova internal violence would be huge either way , since neither of us are slavs so civil war is guaranteed . 
  but what they stand to gain from going for latvia is huge in comparison to what they would gain from attacking moldova . 
  first of all , it wold be the final budge to push nato over the edge into the pit of unaccountability and discredit it forever . 
  no one believes nato would go to war `` for latvia '' , you can thump all the articles in the world , obama is far too scared to do it and western europe has been all but absent in the ukraine crisis . 
  if this is n't true , too bad . 
  they should 've acted like it from the very beginning and maybe we would n't have ended up in this situation .
