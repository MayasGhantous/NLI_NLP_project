  we need you to remain the country we all look up to . 
  do you know why turkey is doing that ? 
  are those disputed areas ? 
  or they want just to tease ? 
  what is the end game ? 
  he probably wanted to say that not wanting to change your way of life since the middle ages because of tradition is very dumb . 
  i do n't understand what this have to do with that saying . 
  do you think imf comes to romania for pleasure ? 
  that 's a very broad assumption . 
  for example , according to that data , swiss and austrians smoke more than romanians . 
  and i very much doubt that their countries are shittier than mine . 
  i really doubt that women here are into middle eastern males . 
  but maybe i am wrong ... 
  you make too much of a sense . 
  you hear that average romanian mayor ? 
  can you please hire some guys from denmark to build something alright once in a while ? 
  maybe he thought you live at the very edge of amsterdam and you 've never seen the center . 
  you should get out of the house man . 
  not according to wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_republic_of_ireland#/media/file:nonnationalsireland2006.png, 
  where is the country of origin ? 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/immigrants-origin.jpg ), 
  how dare the people decide for themselves ? 
  that looks awesome . 
  the project will benefit both countries . 
  i have no answers for your questions ... 
  ah , that i missed, 
  hmm , the way i see it is that it has all the land inhabited by romanians , including northern bukovina and bessarabia . 
  am i looking at it wrong ? 
   the geneva-based international organisation for migration says an estimated 150,000 migrants came to europe by sea between january and july . 
  to give you a perspective , the total number of births in romania for the whole 2011 was ~ 221000 . 
  i also liked the one with the greeks worshiping tsipras ( a.k.a mhysa ) . 
  a lot of people will be very displeased by this map ... i am looking at you poland and hungary, 
  yes , it 's always the banks and the lenders fault . 
  but what about this [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%9315_spanish_financial_crisis ) ? 
  the main cause of spain 's crisis was its ** enormous housing bubble and the accompanying artificial and unsustainably high gdp growth rate ** . 
  one side effect was that ballooning tax revenues ( from the artificially high gdp growth rate ) concealed ** the spanish government 's expenditures , which were unsustainably high ** , until 2007 . 
  [ 3 ] the spanish government supported the critical development by relaxing supervision of the financial sector and thereby allowing the banks to violate international accounting standards board standards . 
  so the banks in spain were able to hide losses and earnings volatility , mislead regulators , analysts , and investors , and thereby finance the spanish real estate bubble . 
  [ 4 ] the results of the crisis were devastating for spain , including a strong economic downturn , a severe increase in unemployment , and bankruptcies of major companies . 
  [ 5 ] even though some fundamental problems in the spanish economy were already evident far ahead of the crisis spain continued the path of unsustainable growth when the ruling party changed in 2004 . 
  in these early times spain ** had already a huge trade deficit , [ 6 ] a loss of competitiveness against its main trading partners , an above-average inflation rate , house price increases , and a growing family indebtedness . 
  or maybe making huge debts did n't work ? 
  or maybe electing populist politicians which promised this and that with some other country money did n't work ? 
  not a single discussion about communism without somebody claiming that communism was not really implemented properly . 
  oh , it was real , it was the real life implementation of a moronic idea of an utopia . 
  shhh , do n't tell that to / u/icankillpenguins, 
  that makes bulgaria antarctica ? 
  i like this pm . 
  he seems to be a very decent human being . 
  i 'm glad he 's now the nato 's secretary general . 
  i think you 're mixing up gdp with gdp ppp . 
  not if it escapes earth 's gravity . 
  pretty cool , indeed, 
  what is this suedia you talk about ? 
  is there anything to like ? 
  just kidding , that is also due to history : constant fighting with the neighbors . 
  but what happened to the dacians according to your version ? 
  they just ... died ? 
  just history, 
  that 's what you get when you are the 3rd larges exporter in the world . 
  everything comes with a price . 
  huh , when i was in germany all the roads looked very nice . 
  and i thought to myself : man those are a lot of autobahns . 
  and then i spent hours in a stau ... i guess that 's because you have also a shitload of cars on the road . 
  i am confused . 
  i thought they were opposing homosexuals . 
  just look at those moves : https://youtu.be/8wh4dxv64mc?t=9m26s . 
  because of all the whining ? 
  being constantly poor does that to you . 
  we are glad you improved it so much with your arguments . 
  no , that 's not it . 
  you see , us romanians are the ancestors of [ dacians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacia ) mixed with romans almost 2 millenniums ago . 
  while the hungarians [ settled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_conquest_of_the_carpathian_basin ) in the current territory in the 8th century . 
  now you do the math . 
  so i watched a german movie once in college and it was kind of bad . 
  i did n't like it at all . 
  that would be 2 euros , merkel !, 
  i think that the ottomans were worse than ah . 
  but that does n't mean that ah was a godsend for romania ( transylvania ) . 
  anyway it 's hard to quantify objectively which were worse than the other . 
  yes , that 's unfortunately true . 
  one free tip for a happy relationship : do n't mention her about trianon . 
  i disagree . 
  it is very unusual . 
  we use it for imported words like kilogram , kilometer . 
  it 's about the land !, 
  why not give it to investors to build a factory there ? 
  we need it more . 
  christian and muslims have enough churches and mosques . 
  the people have the right to protest on how the budget or state resources are spent on . 
  religion is not an excemption . 
  romania has other priorities right now . 
  religion is useful for an individual only if it believes in it . 
  that individual and the ones which share the same beliefs should construct their own fantasy lands and not on state property . 
  you sure are !, 
  we 'll make him the supreme leader and give him the special romanian treatment for supreme leaders * wink wink *, 
  oooh ... i see ... 
  uhmm , what ? 
  why ? 
  well sure , in theory is all nice .
