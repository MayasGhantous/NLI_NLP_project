  thursday , 21 december 2006 wtf , man . 
  the left just put their heads in the sand ignoring the public opinion regarding the mass immigration . 
  well , this has consequences . 
  have you watched the gif ? 
  it also says the nominal output . 
  it just said that a single machine can provide energy for 4000 homes . 
  if the swedes would n't give them money , you would n't have beggars . 
  you want to help poor people ? 
  give money to charities you trust . 
  never give money to beggars . 
  you make us so sad :( neah , just kidding - you can keep those ... romanians , since you guys have such big hearts and want to help everybody . 
  not to mention that you can integrate them so easily , not like us , stupid eastern europeans . 
  huh , til, 
  cheer up neighbor . 
  it will take time , but you 'll make it eventually . 
  the hardest thing you already did , to cut the ties with russia - now it 's time for new ties and friendships . 
  i wish all the best to all of our neighbors because if they are wealthy and healthy , then we will be also . 
  if they are poor and having conflicts , it will be bad for us also as we have less trade and less opportunities overall . 
  i know what per capita means . 
  have you considered the fact that i 've provided with gdp data per capita explicitly to remove the population size from the equation ? 
  therefore my question . 
  thanks for taking your time to share your experiences . 
  i just looked at the street view at the road that you mentioned , holy shit how many potholes . 
  what are the most striking differences between us and them , from your experience and travels ? 
   ukraine 45mio people and romania nearly 20mio . 
  what does this have to do with anything ? 
  the statistics i gave was about gdp ( nominal ) per capita . 
   ukraine with its trucks ( manifacturing and steel and stuff ) . 
  this was easier to sell to the east . 
  torwards the western market there is a huge frontier of competition andlobbyism like vw \u00b4 s man or else oh , so they can produce those stuff , but they do n't actually have anybody to sell to anymore ? 
  no , they are not . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  in eastern europe they are mostly not integrated . 
  the translation is very hard to follow . 
   lot of the economy is in the shadows , so actual gdp is probably twice reported gdp if not more . 
  aha , so that might explain the big differences on paper but not so much in reality . 
   the gdp per capita difference is like between romania and france it 's not the same , actually . 
  yes , france has , roughly , 4 times the gdp per capita , nominal , than us and we have 4 times the ukraine 's . 
  but the difference is big : difference of gdp/nominal/capita between france and romania : 28775 difference of gdp/nominal/capita between romania and ukraine : 6904 . 
  so , basically , france can spend much more money than us on nice things , like good looking cities . 
   it has quite smartly levitated between russia and the west eh , only recently . 
  the bombing in 1999 resulted in an estimated 30 billions loss . 
   it 's also a smaller country , where just the trade done with the neighbours and funds from the eu and us are enough to lift the average gdp far more so than in 45 million ukraine . 
  this i can understand . 
  yes , but you can say the same stuff about serbia which is doing better , although it had full scale wars after ' 89 . 
  and serbia did n't had the advantage ukraine had with all the highly sophisticated good that they produced . 
  this anticorruption movement started to gain momentum only recently . 
  it has an impact , sure , but not as high as people think . 
  the impact is mostly on the mentality than the economy . 
  we will see a bigger impact on the economy on the long run , though . 
  yes , but this was also true for romania . 
  look at this gdp drop after 1989 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_romania#/media/file:romania_gdp_1983-2003.jpg, 
  ca n't wait for next week to read about other regular saturdays from europe !, 
  i 'm shocked as well . 
  eh , we were quite close to each other not so long ago : http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/historyatlas/images/3/32/romania_massr_1920.png/revision/latest?cb=20101216050000, 
  i did n't said it is smart or rational . 
  i just stated how i felt . 
  when visiting a place , feelings are important . 
  i liked the video . 
  budapest is a very , very nice city but i am still bitter about it . 
  i just want to rant : i visited budapest with a friend at the beginning of our euro trip and when we parked the car near the center some guys sitting on a bench told us to drive away after seeing our romanian plates . 
  and so we did . 
  i know that assholes are everywhere but it made me feel unwelcomed so i do n't think i 'll ever visit it again . 
   normally people use `` just saying '' as armour from repercussions of being a jerk yeah , but you ca n't say the same thing about `` i 'm sorry '' . 
  i 'm sorry but i think that you overthink internet comments and your face looks like a piano . 
  oh , so you 've discovered that you can , basically , say the same thing using different language constructs ? 
   and you 're the attention whore who wants to start a flame war , not gon na get that from me , sorry . 
  erhm , can you see yourself contradicting ? 
  you just continued the flame war and gave him attention . 
  just saying . 
   `` i will show you what leading a country really means , '' he added . 
  whenever i hear a politician talk like that i 'm convinced that they are full of shit . 
  the swiss will have a heart attack seeing this . 
  yes , that 's bullshit but it 's also a fact . 
  that does n't mean we should take it easy with the corrupts , but we should n't have high expectations that things will get very fast much better . 
  changing mentalities takes time . 
  unfortunately ( and also counter-intuitive ) , jailing corrupt people means also fewer investments on the short-medium term . 
  they are afraid to spend the public money on investments so they just spend it on things that will bring them votes : salaries , pensions , etc. 
  but it will get better in the long run . 
  i do n't think that there would be ethnic issues . 
  we love westerners and we love money . 
  we had a significant saxon population which were , generally , richer than us or the hungarians and we did n't had any issues with them . 
  turkmen not turkish . 
  meaning he 's from turkmenistan , not turkey . 
  never mind your military power , croatian math skills are much more impressive !, 
  dude , relax . 
  this is the internet . 
  it was a joke . 
  just like the video you just watched . 
  jeezus . 
   hungarians from hungary do n't give a crap about transilvania . 
  among the numerous reasons , the biggest is the economic one . 
  what are you raving about ? 
  do you have any data to support that ? 
  here , i have one : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1f/gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant%2c_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29%2c_by_nuts_level_2_region%2c_2013_%28%c2%b9%29_%28%25_of_the_eu-28_average%2c_eu-28_%3d_100%29_ryb15.png where is that huge economical gap ? 
  please , do some research before expressing your opinions . 
  slovenes are such badasses that it 's no wonder their independence war lasted only [ 10 days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war ) . 
  thanks for showing your view of the history , it is interesting . 
  however , i feel that you are a bit one-sided regarding the internal displacement of populations . 
  hungarians did it too : they brought saxons as settlers and the szeklers as border guards .
