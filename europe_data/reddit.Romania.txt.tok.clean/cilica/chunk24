  refugees are allowed , indeed . 
  but immigration is not a fundamental human right . 
  this has nothing to do with the anti-corruption agency . 
  he 's being indicted by the supreme court prosecution . 
  it 's because scandinavian people are advanced and we are the backward ones . 
  no sarcasm here - i really believe this . 
  religion is dragging us down with its stupidity . 
   it also did n't really improve the piece for me it sounds the same as ordinary europeans singing this . 
  maybe it 's because i have no idea what their saying . 
  but it sounds glorious !, 
  is n't it common knowledge that rt is just a propaganda machine ? 
  i see your point . 
  but , with my calculations , you 'll get something around 1200 euro average for greece and 400 euro average for romania , if we adjust the pension by the ppp increase . 
  by using the gdp per capita ppp was not to achieve a perfect comparison regarding the pension analysis but it can show an anomaly when making comparison between countries ( which is shown by the nominal values as well ) . 
  why should they be ? 
  sample numbers : greece gdp per capita 2013 ( ppp ) : 25,667 romania gdp per capita 2013 ( ppp ) : 18,974 ___ greece average pension : 833 euro romania 's average pension : 188 euro, 
  i 'm specifically talking about the former soviet republics ( russia , ukraine , the baltic states , etc. ), 
  ** not ** the eastern bloc in general ( poland , hungary , czechoslovakia , etc. ), 
  reading comprehension : 0, 
  brief history : - historic moldova has 2 parts : one in romania and one being the present day moldova ( + other parts in ukraine but we 'll skip those for now ) . 
  - in 1812 the ottoman empire ceded the present day moldova ( eastern part of the historical region ) to russian empire . 
  - in 1859 western part of moldova united with wallachia to form romania - in 1918 , at the end of ww1 , present day moldova was integrated into romania ( also other territories like transylvania ) . 
  - in 1944 , near the end of ww2 , moldova was re-anexed by russians and joined the soviet union . 
  - at the collapse of the soviet union , moldova remained an independent state . 
   it does n't `` exclude '' debt , it merely substracts debt i do n't understand . 
  if you substract debt , does n't it mean that it 's excluded ? 
  what am i missing here ? 
  i do n't see how those events are related . 
   this sub is full of xenophobes and racists i do n't agree with you . 
   fuck this sub , i 'm out . 
  well quitting wo n't help things , is n't it ? 
  if you really believe that you are correct you should influence others to change their views . 
  but you need to present decent arguments like an adult instead of having tantrums and crying that `` the others do not share my view !, 
  the wealth analysis excludes debt . 
   if i count my apartment , my car and my savings if you have the apartment and car paid off , and you also have savings , then yes , you are rich in romania . 
  consider that half of romanians are living in rural areas . 
  their biggest wealth is their house and land ( but that house is usually divided to 2 or more adults and it 's not worth too much ) . 
  there are also a lot of people that do not own a house/apartment . 
  i have a middle-high income but my wealth is small as i have an apartment with a mortgage on it . 
   our ambition is to generate the global pattern of household wealth . 
  the first stage in this process is to estimate the ** average level of household wealth ** and its core components for every country, 
  as credit suisse explained :  more specifically , we are interested in the distribution within and across nations of individual net worth , defined as the ** marketable value of financial assets plus non-financial assets ( principally housing and land ) less debts ** .

  i like the guardian , but they are also a little bit biased on the migration topic . 
  see their reporting : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/afghan-refugee-shot-dead-police-turkey-enter-bulgaria you can see that they add an image with children although it has nothing to do with that group in cause . 
  wow , that 's a lot of money !, 
  good for you bosnia . 
  we need to find out details about this story to understand what really happened . 
  one thing to remember though : illegally crossing a border is dangerous . 
  and it should be so . 
  warning shots are not safe either . 
  it should be investigated , though , that it was indeed a warning shot aimed at something else . 
  anyway , illegally crossing a border has major risks , and we , from the former iron curtain , know all too well . 
  border guards have guns . 
  you ignore warning shots when you illegally cross the border . 
  you die . 
  surprise ? 
  warning shots are no use if the other party knows that you 'll do nothing if you cross the line . 
  warning shots are what they are : a warning . 
  if you 're dumb enough to ignore them , you 're asking to be shot . 
  economically , eu and usa are on match . 
  we spend more money on social benefits ( welfare , healthcare , paid vacations , maternal leaves ) while they spend more money on projecting power . 
  therefore you have the illusion that it 's better . 
  i would n't trade europe for nothing . 
   income per capita that is very unequally distributed . 
  see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wealth_inequality_in_the_united_states#/media/file:u.s._distribution_of_wealth,_2007.jpg 40 % population have 0.2 % of wealth . 
  romania is n't claiming to be the most powerful and prosperous country on earth . 
  i like to think we are not having usa as a model of a country to become but more like norway , denmark , finland , the netherlands , etc. 
  powerful ? 
  yes . 
  prosperous ? 
  only for the few . 
  a country that does not give universal healthcare and paid maternal leave is pretty backwards in my book . 
  what do you mean by `` local government '' ? 
  isuse cristoase !, 
  i think that most of liberal americans want to see a big change in their country . 
  so they rally behind their best match . 
  honestly , sanders looks to be the better candidate from the democrats ( also republicans - but they do n't count as they are mostly insane ) . 
   it 's intentionally meant to be idiot proof . 
  it 's intentionally meant to keep the status quo , you mean . 
  tyrants !, 
  if they are economic migrants , they should be judged as such : by their economic worth , not by the humanitarian aspect . 
  got it now ? 
  the handicapped people in our countries are our responsibility , these people are not . 
  also our handicapped people are well integrated into the society . 
  it 's all nice to help others but we should do it with a limit . 
  hehe , that 's actually clever . 
  sd is going to the top . 
  but now i have that song stuck in my head . 
   why ca n't europe learn from australia and canada how can we learn something from those savages ? 
  our white knight armor shines bright into the sun while we protect the cute refugee lady doctor from evil nazis !, 
  i do n't know what / r/shitfront has to do with the current topic . 
  please tell us . 
  southern economies were near collapse due to incompetence and unfeasible debt . 
  not germany 's fault . 
  people actually blame germany 's success for their failures , it 's stupid . 
  to go back to your initial criticism : germany , as represented by its government , supports ttip . 
  it 's the german people which are being against and it 's their right to be so . 
  i 'm getting tired of all this german bashing . 
  ebola in africa ?
