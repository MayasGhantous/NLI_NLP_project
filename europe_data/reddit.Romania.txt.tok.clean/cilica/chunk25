  ze germans . 
  latest transformers movie is shit ? 
  ze germans of course . 
  if this is the main hospital for one of our biggest city and county , i guess you can make reasonable assumptions regarding our whole healthcare infrastructure . 
  how about we post whatever the fuck we want !, 
  yeah , let 's do that , ok ? 
  the pictures are representative for 80 % of romanian healthcare . 
  when you visit only the touristy places , of course you make a good impression . 
  come to shitty small post industrial towns and you 'll understand the `` hidden '' reality . 
  we need to show these to be ashamed of ourselves . 
  not only show nice things that mostly rich people benefit of to give the impression that we 're allright when we 're , actually , not . 
  germany relies for its economy on exports . 
  where do you think it exports the most , tax free ? 
  ah , the good ol' `` i do not accept that others think otherwise than myself , they must be either retarded either bloodthirsty nazis . '', 
  you left because belgium is better . 
  now you feel you do n't belong there and you glorify romania when you 're not here . 
  you want to change romania for good ? 
  bitching on reddit whenever a negative post about it is made is n't going to help . 
  especially if you are a hypocrite that left romania for a better life in belgium . 
  but if we post only nice things in romania , that is n't also attention whoring ? 
  good job comrade !, 
  the glorious and immortal belarussian state has decided to give you +10 points for showing those capitalist pigs where the true civilized people are . 
  i did n't said that uk is feudal . 
  i made analogy to show that it 's just wrong to consider something backward like a monarchy ok just because it 's historic but not ok if you start it now . 
  neah . 
  it 's like you say it 's ok to be a feudal state in 2015 because you 've been like this since 1200 . 
  reform to atheism ? 
  no , putting ugly things under the rug will do it . 
  that hospital is part of europe so people should know about it and we should be ashamed of it . 
  if we are ashamed maybe we 'll try harder to change things . 
  yeah , but yugoslavia stopped being a ridiculous kingdom . 
  do you want to trigger the british or what ? 
  programmers , doctors , economists , engineers . 
  maybe for you guys it was better back then , but for us it 's much better now . 
  much , much better . 
  please . 
  bbc told me that mostly doctors , engineers and little cute girls are coming to you . 
  boy , do i envy you ... 
  oh , shut up you butthurt !, 
  this is the reality around here !, 
  no point in hiding it . 
  i 've explained here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3o2w5c/romania_withdraws_bid_to_join_schengen_area/cvtjhsw 635 millions euros payed by romania , 340 millions euros payed by eu . 
  neah , it actually make sense . 
  getting rid of the mcv must be our politicians wet dream . 
  sees offensive comment . 
  looks at flair . 
  it all makes sense . 
  anyway , there are 2 % roma people in serbia as opposed to 3.3 % in romania . 
  i. . . never thought about this that way . 
  huh ... 
  `` lovely illegal immigrant , be wary of the homosex border police . 
  they will love you gently in places you 'll be ashamed to admit you like being touched . 
  while listening to conchita wurst 's latest hit . '', 
  throw leaflets in middle east & africa . 
  sit back and relax while number of illegal immigrants drop significantly . 
   ur own gandul article says 500 i 've taken those numbers from the letter of the internal affairs minister : http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/186/3928/12923634/1/screen-shot-2014-07-10-at-2-19-09-pm.jpg?height=764&amp;width=600, 
   lame , harmless quips :( now you 're being harsh . 
  it 's hard for me to make original non-lame jokes when compared to [ you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/3ntfvq/this_sub_sucks/cvsj11n ) . 
  i know , right ? 
  oh , but i 've been banned alright . 
  by that french mod for complaining ( decently , i might say ) about the immigration megathreads . 
  i wrote an email to all mods to clarify and i 've been unbanned quickly . 
  now i have to live with fear of persecution :(, 
  i guess we want `` just enough '' for border controls . 
  spending more than half a billion euros to achieve excellence in one area when you can put those money to much better use ( like hospitals , highways ) is not what we want . 
  we are afraid to not cross the line of politically correctness . 
  `` banned for racism : not all americans are dirty ! '', 
  that 's why i need to clarify that it 's sarcasm . 
  actually , no . 
  romania payed mostly for it . 
  635 millions euros payed by romania , 340 millions euros payed by eu .

  it 's not like we spent a shitload of money on state-of-the art border control equipment as a requirement to join schengen for nothing . 
  that will deter migrants better than razorwire . 
  why yes , he was the mayor of sibiu before that . 
  you kind of asked for it . 
  neah , they are clearly cute little hearts !, 
  yeah , about that motto ... 
  you were the first to make a hint regarding nazism in a post about germany !, 
  well done . 
  now get out . 
  dirty americans , trying to bring their decadent socialist ideals to the world . 
  / s , just in case a mod thinks that i 'm serious . 
  hello saxon friend . 
  today is your lucky day , may i interest you in romania ? 
  my town sibiu ( hermanstadt ) was founded by saxons just like you !, 
  please bring money . 
  germans right now : http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/962/640/658.png, 
  it depends on your character . 
  some people , like myself , are atracted by stuff like that while some people are not . 
  i would not like to live a basic rural life as i like confort and i 'm quite lazy . 
  but i am very exited whenever i visit places like that and , very often , feel genuine happiness there . 
  maybe it 's because the primordialism of it , who knows . 
  we have in sibiu a museum with romanian traditional buildings : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztm2gvkuwwo, 
   surrounded by 100 % ethic romanians , you can leave your wallet on the table - nobody is going to touch it . 
  what are you smoking , boy ? 
  i guess you 're that kind of nationalistic guy that thinks romanians are the god 's chosen creature , right ? 
  yeah , there is no single romanian thief in this world , our elected politicians are not corrupt and our farts smell like roses . 
   rural people are generally honest , but of course you need to watch out for gypsies just ... just do n't , ok ?
