  stop . 
  what i would suggest is the following : find a nice location on booking.com ( [ example 1 ] ( http://www.booking.com/hotel/ro/cabana-moapsilor.ro.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-17caeoggjcalhysdnibw5vcmvmamabiaebmaeguaeeyaee2aeb6aeb-ael;sid=ce2bb43496284109b6b90f451ad830b0;dcid=4;dist=0;group_adults=2;room1=a%2ca;sb_price_type=total;srfid=f74d04b3312b020e26857e5ffb44d8ab20bad725x2;type=total;ucfs=1&amp; ) , [ example2 ] ( http://www.booking.com/hotel/ro/hohe-rinne-paltinis.ro.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-17caeoggjcalhysdnibw5vcmvmamabiaebmaeguaeeyaee2aeb6aeb-ael;sid=ce2bb43496284109b6b90f451ad830b0;dcid=4;checkin=2015-10-10;checkout=2015-10-11;dist=0;group_adults=2;room1=a%2ca;sb_price_type=total;srfid=e4a4b7cfc21f2c4cf1e49eed1f8832eb1eb7dbb6x1;type=total;ucfs=1&amp; ) ) . 
  i recommend near cluj or sibiu because they are very nice and have international airports . 
  there you should rent a car and start exploring . 
  if you do n't have a driving license , there is public transport but it 's very limited , depending on the location ( once per day or so ) . 
  no , you 're not going to get robbed but be cautions , nonetheless ( no exposed non-guarded valuables ) . 
  i would say it 's pretty safe here ( low violence ) . 
  english is understood by young people , but mostly in urban areas . 
  you 'll find less in rural areas . 
   are we looked at as walking wallets to prey upon and try and get as much money as they can get ? 
  at the farmer markets , yes . 
  but this is the same for us also , you need to know the value of what you 're buying so you do n't get ripped off . 
  so look for fixed price items ( items that have a price tag on them ) . 
  dude ... have you checked my flair ? 
  this is very much real in 2015 romania and i love every bit of it . 
  just so you know the differences between the urban and rural areas are quite big . 
  horse drawn carriages are still very common here . 
  my parents-in-law are still working the fields with the horse and plough and live with 100 euros per month pension . 
  they mostly pay for electricity , gas , sugar and oil . 
  if you want to go back in time , for real - no simulation , and you do n't want to leave eu , come visit rural romania - you 'll be very much surprised !, 
  in a good way . 
  some more images : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg9uh2-qhy0, 
  great , now i want a finnish home !, 
  it has to be so the area of impact is big so the wood does n't chip . 
  huh , now i see that their site ( imf ) has some interesting charts that show various economic indexes since 1980 up to the forcasted 2020 : http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/index.php, 
  the video , if true , is quite disturbing . 
  so i should n't ? 
  what ?!, 
  there were casualties due to these `` dog fights '' and war almost broke out in 96 . 
  there is no `` agreement '', 
  the comment is n't idiotic . 
  this is how the government thinks . 
  yeah , how about you do n't take my words out of context . 
  i was talking about bureaucracy there . 
  eh , it 's not so bad . 
  it 's basically a normal experience with bureaucracy . 
  welcome to eu !, 
  we had to sit 10 hours in the rain in november just to vote for the president at out fucking cunsulate in germany . 
  thousands of people sitting in the cold november rain ... 
  that wo n't go well for turks . 
  if kurds get their own state out of syria they 'll want the kurd part from turkey and iraq as well, 
  i 'm genuinely curious what was so de-humanizing about it . 
  neah , turkey is n't in any way weaker than those . 
  as for genocide ... let 's just say that you are talking shit . 
  tukey get to taste their own medicine . 
  it 's the same stuff they are doing to greece airspace frequently . 
   the dutch economy is profitable because they anticipate so many tourists a year you see , you are just hearing what you want to hear . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/07/us-tourism-europe-sb-idustre53601d20090407 here you 'll find a table with how much tourism is a percentage of gdp . 
  so , nothing extraordinary for netherlands even if it has weed legal in some parts . 
  it 's even lower than the overall eu ( tourism generates 13 % of gdp ( direct and indirect ) ) . 
  source : http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/tourism-intensity/tourism-contribution-to-gdp so it 's safe to say that netherlands is not rich because of tourism and certainly not because of weed . 
  all in all , sorry to burst your bubble , but weed wo n't help your country as much as you think it would . 
  listen pal , how about you stop being a hypocrite , alright ? 
  this is one of the [ comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2yk1w9/think_of_russia_as_an_ordinary_petrostate_not_an/cpazw3m ) you had to a deleted post ( maybe it was really infuriating to comment so . 
  but you have double standards , nonetheless ) :  you are disgrace to your country . 
  i just hope that you 're kind of a special snowflake and the rest of frenchmen are not such stupid racist cunts like you . 
  is that personal to you ? 
  i think so , yeah . 
  another piece of [ hypocrisy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbbsp/eurotunnel_services_for_passengers_and_freight/cvmnnan ) since you are a mod :  please , refrain from racial generalizations . 
  thank you . 
  when just a month ago you wrote this gem : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jux9e/only_25_of_asylum_seekers_are_women_and_children/cusiqp4, 
   shit flinging yeah , but this is quite a loose term . 
  i just asked him if he were a bot , considering i have seen that exact comment before in a another thread . 
  how is this shit-flinging ? 
  there are tons of sites that ask me for captcha to prove i am not a robot . 
  should i be offended ? 
  my guess is that you are taking it personal for whatever reasons you have and just want to flex your mod muscles to censor others for : `` ermagerd u insulted that poor guy ! '', 
  what ? 
  lol , i think you are the one taking it personal . 
  i knew you were a good addition to the mod team . 
  here is the comment in question : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ncwql/russia_warns_bulgaria_over_mig29_deal_with_poland/cvn08v0 a bot is an agent repeating the same stuff all over again . 
   why ca n't weed be ours ? 
  it 's worked amazingly for holland . 
  for amsterdam , you mean . 
  anyway , you do realize that weed is contributing very little to the overall netherland 's economy ? 
   a tiny village made billions of dollars because it 's illegal . 
  if it were legal , everybody would do it and it would be worth as much as potatoes . 
  lol . 
  you need a functional economy , not weed villages , whatever the fuck that means . 
  where do you sell it legally ? 
  i 'm starting to understand where those millionaires came from now . 
  i can swear i read that exact comment before . 
  are you an anti-putin bot ? 
  if your point was to be a child , then yes , you 've proven quite well . 
   i expect this ( my ) post to be downvoted to hell . 
  done . 
  at least you 're not a giant lake like moldova . 
  they are not from romania , but there is a sizable minority here ~ 3 % . 
  they were treated badly through their entire existence . 
  now , not so much , so they tend to over enjoy , let say like this , their new status . 
  i have had gypsy friends and they are ok , really . 
  it 's the same with everybody : some are ok , some ... not so much . 
  do n't trust flairs . 
  hmm , but i thought romania invaded southern dobrogea in second balkan war , not in ww1 . 
  too many wars man , it 's confusing . 
  it 's what most of us think . 
  since the mainstream politicians and media would not listen to us , we play the same old record where we are heard . 
  uhmm ... what ? 
  the butthurt is strong with this one . 
  i wish people would actually understand the labels they are throwing at others .
