  refugees are safe in turkey . 
  we should help a lot more turkey to deal with such a big number of refugees . 
  message : please do n't force feed us with multiculturalism . 
  we can help genuine refugees in other ways , like , for example , the way of uk . 
  it 's not about the money . 
  it 's about sending a message . 
  that 's a good question . 
  i mean you do n't have to risk that your niece is getting raped only to go to uk . 
  it 's uk !, 
  it rains all the time and they do n't have baguettes . 
  i do n't get it . 
  why is n't the french police guarding the place ? 
  sexual offenders to be arrested and deported immediately . 
   was a radio interview with someone who only saw the tail end of the incident please , this is apologetic i do n't even ... how come bbc had the photo of the incident when that guy reported ? 
  they must have seen the whole video beforehand . 
  of course there is no diversity . 
  everybody knows that white people are just clones of hitler . 
  the foreigners also import them , so why need them ? 
  it 's not like bamboo is being grown by the chinese farmer settled in europe . 
  what really happened ( euronews source ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gaxpqem6mk, 
  what really happened ( euronews source ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gaxpqem6mk, 
  it was wrong , not just incomplete . 
  they explicitly stated that the guy was trying to help them . 
  that 's lying in my book . 
  watch it again : https://vid.me/nhcc start with second 0:54 i think they corrected the version as soon as public outrage kicked in . 
  this does not make up to the fact that they are biased and try to influence the viewers . 
  not to mention the brain drain the west have profited off . 
  i think eastern/western europe has more to do with the iron curtain than geography . 
  bbc is such a disappointment . 
  when i saw how they twisted that story with that guy that threw his family on the train tracks i was speechless . 
   in the end , the choice is clear . 
  europe 's best shot at prosperity is to build upon the diversity that immigration will bring . 
  no , thanks . 
  how come western europe had prosperity without the forced diversity ? 
  i 'm so sick of this multiculturalism propaganda . 
  we have enough diversity . 
  if i want to eat chinese , i look up a recipe on the internet and make it . 
  if i want to listen to arabian hip-hop , i watch an youtube video . 
  internet makes physical multiculturalism obsolete . 
  `` papers , please '' `` germany , germany ! '', 
  `` rejected . 
  next ! '', 
  at least admit defeat when you are wrong and not just continue being a bufoon . 
  austria took more than the proposed quota , your comment is invalid . 
  hehe , you said lesbos . 
  yes , i heard that too . 
  totally legit history . 
  it 's vlad . 
  not vladislav . 
  we 're not slavs , god dammit !, 
  it does n't absolve us . 
  but western countries think they are holier , which is just not true . 
  it is you who are being the straw man . 
  one incident sanctioned by the authorities does not caracterize a nation . 
  another one . 
  listen you should take your news from reliable sources . 
  this is how roma live in romania ( only an example , of course poor roma live very badly but you can say like this also by poor romanians ) : https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.0121552,25.2223674,3a,75y,276.11h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2pww5ptslhxqhvdejkx2nw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d2pww5ptslhxqhvdejkx2nw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d175.86288%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=de and this is how roma live in france : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2470124/marseille-roma-gypsies-french-police-clear-large-site-ghost-town-rubbish.html, 
   the police are gravely concerned and condemn these actions . 
  that will show them !, 
  uhmmm ... what ? 
  lol , you have no idea what are you talking about , son . 
  we mostly live without incidents one with each other . 
  they are , still , not integrated ( after hundreds of years ) but they , at least , do n't try to force their beliefs like radical muslims would do . 
  you should look up how france deported gypsies back to romania although gypsies are also eu citizens and have the right to work/live in france . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_romani_people_from_france and you people dare criticize ee ? 
  sure . 
  but that 's their reality . 
  their home was destroyed by that version of islam and we do n't want to import that . 
  you could argue that the majority of the refugees is not like that , of course , but we consider the risk too big . 
  eastern europe is mostly against islam , not against a race . 
  we do n't understand it , we do n't like it and it does n't fit with our view of the world . 
  simple as that . 
   germany on tuesday ramped up the pressure , saying that eu aid could be cut from member states that refused to take their share of migrants . 
  so , take migrants or money is cut . 
  that 's a standard definition of blackmail . 
   hopes of a unanimous deal collapsed in the face of opposition from hungary , the czech republic , slovakia and romania at the crisis meeting in brussels , officials said . 
  iron curtain 2 : so it begins confirmed . 
   germany going full nazi ah , the inevitable nazi comment . 
  wow , serbia is scary  it seems romania is at the very bottom next to japan . 
  i have never heard of somebody having a gun here except military , police and the occasionally hunter . 
  they look both russian and muslim at the same time . 
  chechen confirmed . 
  source : internet stranger opinion . 
  i know , right ? 
  i love it !, 
  one by one the pieces of schengen start to fall . 
  or so it seems ... at least they can admit us and the bulgarians in the last minute so that we can check another achievement on our todo list . 
  please , do n't mock children . 
  just do n't . 
  this is a nice example of a shit-post . 
   friends [ ... ] told me the rudeness and filthy looks wild claims ? 
  checked . 
  personal subjective evidence ? 
  checked . 
   french is pretty obsolete on a global scale read this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organisation_internationale_de_la_francophonie also , when in rome , do as the romans do . 
  do n't be outraged when people do n't understand you . 
  learn their language . 
  i think i 'm starting to not care anymore . 
  soon , stuff like this will become the norm in europe and we wo n't find it outrageous anymore as we 'll all become de-sensitized . 
  none of that shit matter in sweden though .
