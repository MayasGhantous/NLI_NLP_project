  italy just dodged a bul ... erhmm . . knife . 
  this is a very good initiative , well done !, 
  but you should add also the option for the user to arrange/add/remove the feed for the countries of interest . 
  just my 2 cents . 
  maybe we can do it with constant acceleration : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_travel_using_constant_acceleration time for the people on board such a ship would not be too long until you reach other stars , although on earth million of years have passed . 
  this approach has 2 major obstacles : fuel ( you need a lot of it ) and impact with just a tiny matter fragment would have major consequences to the ship at those speeds . 
  well i 'll be ... how come we did n't heard about this ? 
  having kids crammed up like that is heartbreaking :(, 
  what about that hotel ? 
  is something special about it ? 
  immigration is not the biggest threat ever - that 's just a stupid thing to say - but it 's the biggest concern right now among european citizens , according to the euro barometer . 
  yes , welcome , [ welcome ] ( https://youtu.be/y4dhj3so0sa?t=16s ) !, 
  i 'm gon na leave this short christmas carol featuring the police right [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfzllvcn2jg ) . 
  ( `` iata vin colindatorii '' = `` here comes the carol singers '' ), 
  no , you see , europe is not suffering . 
  it actually has a good growth . 
   i visited kiek in de k\u00f6k solely for its name . 
  sooooo , did you liked it ?

  i did n't even bothered to search . 
  do it yourself . 
  except anti-gypsy , i also share the other views . 
  yeah , good luck finding a gentleman in that game . 
  yeah , no . 
  in sibiu it 's quite clean . 
  i 'm from sibiu and i can tell you it 's very nice . 
  but mostly in the old center and in the old saxon villages around it . 
  also mountains  there are lots of cultural events going on in sibiu most of the time so you should come by and check them out . 
  we are sorry , but they are free people - we ca n't force them to do anything . 
  you should n't give them money - that 's how you stop the beggars . 
  also , you will save their children too by doing that . 
  beggars are giving them alcohol to stay relaxed and do n't cry too much when they are babies and send them to beg instead of going to school when they are big enough . 
  make begging illegal and take their children away !, 
  is there anything else needed ? 
  `` our '' anyway , this saturday , i was at a mixed wedding : bride was romanian and the groom hungarian and there was also mixed folk songs from both cultures . 
  it was actually nice , no heated spirits , no bad looks , etc. 
  i had a good time . 
   now they are digging themselves out of the dirt . 
  oh , you think the dirt is your ally , but you merely adopted the dirt . 
  i was born in it , moulded by it . 
  i did n't see the light until i was already a man ; by then , it was nothing to me but blinding !, 
   when you are being attacked from all sides you can say that for most of the european countries , though . 
  just look at france 's history , for example . 
  you should understand the statistics : we sent much more skilled workers ( we actually have a problem with medics fleeing the country ) than beggars . 
  sadly , the beggars have a much more visibility and reach to the public and media . 
  oh boy , here we go . 
  5-25 % difference is not `` vastly '' inefficient . 
  gdb growth has momentum , it will grow faster in the future , i think . 
  taxes are collected mostly from private individuals & businesses . 
  so the public spending decrease being higher than the tax revenue decrease does n't mean that the tax revenue collection improved . 
  the title is , actually , technically accurate . 
  you are the one which draws conclusions , and quite incorrect ones . 
  the public spending dropped by 12.3 % : this means the spending made only by the government ( which was predictable due to approved austerity measures ) . 
  blaming only one side , greeks or the troika , is stupid . 
  plus , they can leave the euro whenever they would like . 
  huh , today also i read that spain 's economy is back on its feet . 
  did n't the troika also imposed austerity measures there as well ? 
  holy shit , that was awesome !, 
  ok troll , whatever . 
  nobody owes shit . 
  it 's a comic and they have the freedom of speech . 
  nobody blamed the current german generation man , stop victimizing . 
  we 're nothing like russia . 
  you are taking those words out of context . 
  do n't do that , please . 
  yeah , unlike the rest of europe which had peace and rainbows since forever . 
  so , if i beat the shit out of you , it would be ok just until the bruises are gone ? 
  after that , the past is the pst , right ? 
  no emotional scar , no nothing ? 
  like it never happened ? 
  well , not quite . 
  russians had nukes several years after the americnas had them, 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  if by circlejerk you mean that all the world condemns the nazis for being shitscum , then yes , this is a circlejerk . 
  please stop with the evil this , evil that preaching , we 're past the inquisition time . 
  we 'll have less innovation then . 
  no , profit is good . 
  well then , i guess the euro zone countries should make a referendum about this . 
  surely greeks would understand the democracy involved in that , right ? 
  i wonder what the average joe would vote ... 
  so you just found out that an entire country is evil based on one internet comment . 
  well done . 
  i mean that they are very similar in culture with the balkans . 
  so , if balkans are european , then so does turkey . 
  so their entire arguments are based on the turks-kurds relationship ? 
  maybe nato should give up on turkey for those reasons ( although turkey is too valuable with its army and its position ) , but not europe . 
  europe has a lot more connections with turkey that go beyond military alliances . 
  turkey is as much european as the balkans is european . 
  meh , amateurish video . 
  but it has a guitar as a soundtrack so it 's ok . 
  yes , while i do n't agree with him , i respect him for not being a hypocrite . 
  actually , we should keep on supporting them . 
  by educating them , especially women and by raising their standards of living , they will make less children . 
  no , that 's not like in kosovo . 
  you see , romanians are the descendants of dacians mixed with a lot of other cultures , most notably romans . 
  hungarians came in those lands many centuries after , so romanians were there from the beginning , not coming from valachia or moldova . 
  that was an interesting read but it has lots of challenges , just to mention a few : - the money needed for such a project - get the state wanting to house it - prevent chaos . 
  immigrants are already fighting each other in small camps , imagine what would happen in a metropolis : things would heat up pretty quickly . 
  you guys should check out [ sibiu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sibiu ) !,
