  wrong !, 
  all of us have puta as in pu\u021ba  but yeah not in the sense of portuguese meaning of '' puta '' even tho arguably all of our politicians are putas !, 
  anybody wants to buy some organs ? 
  we have some politicians that we have to decommission so quality will be low . 
  she was clearly just trying to make sauron senpai notice her . 
  is this an undercover attempt by belgium to get into the metal/hard rock scene ? 
  inb4 gets renamed to : the former former yugoslavian republic of macedonia . 
  this is what happends when you eat too much potatoes and not enough beans ? 
  you do realise that if russians would impose democracy in own country they would join the eu in like 5 years yea ? 
  which is exactly a shittier smaller version of what the eu could be . 
  we are already in an economic union . 
  next is monetary and then political . 
  shittier smaller version of what eu could be ? 
  if i were serbian right now my head would explode . 
  beer and rumburak !, 
  is called adapting so you can bang the neighbour 's girls . 
  so you are basically saying : '' we will never be care ! '', 
  we will just have to agree to disagree on this one . 
  i think 95 % did understand it . 
  but since i provided context now , thanks to you , 100 % will . 
  great teamwork !, 
  is just a pun dude . 
  [ from this ] ( https://youtu.be/eb3zo4dofqa ) also twitch chats spamming : '' we will never be subs ! '', 
  we will never be slavs !, 
  is fake news !!!!, 
  [ romanian reaction everytime hungarians whine about transilvania starter pack ] ( https://youtu.be/-rwifmdujea?t=6 ), 
  til that kfc is a rip-off from rfe : roman fried eagle, 
  but if you ask viktor orban, 
  she talks like this : `` gugu gaga '', 
  and with that comment of mine i was responding to this * specific * comment :  he was brought on this british interview specifically for brexit questions about current negotiations . 
  is that really hard to understand ? 
  also the british people are not negotiating with the eu theyre goverment is . 
  your acting like he was called there to give a play by play of how eu negotiatons work so that the british people could put that knowledge to practice . 
  no they wont the british appointed negotiators will . 
  how about you cut off the middle man and call eu officials to interview and they will tell the british people exactly what it is they want and plan to negotiate on ? '', 
  why use a 3rd party to get `` second hand information '' on the eu when the eu is ** able and willing ** to provide it ? 
  tell you why because this show was not about informing is about demonizing the side not represented and galvanizing the target audience ( british public ) in an united opposing front in relation to it . 
  you can choose to believe that is not true i can choose to belive it is . 
  we both have our respective rights to do just that so why not just move on with our lives . 
   why germany still has so many middle-class manufacturing jobs because is secretly middle earth ? 
  if the eu was partially to blame then countries in same situation a.k.a. 
  all other eu countries , would have similar deficit problems . 
  so the actual main problems were populist politicians that would rather get more debt than take the measures to fix it and tax havens . 
  also need i remind you who is going after the big corps for evading tax payments to eu countries ? 
  oh snap the eu is . 
   they probably had one the previous day or the next one . 
  there are plenty of pro eu voices in the uk despite what this sub will tell you looking forward to watching that interview after it gets posted on / r/europe . 
  who knows maybe they will invite/or already invited `` a phd person '' that was part of the negotiating team for the eu on the greek matter . 
  yeah right  i wo n't hold my breath on that one . 
   he is a phd and a politician active in european politics . 
  you think they should have invited you ? 
  no , i think they should have also invited an actual eu official that is also a phd and politician active in european politics to provide information aswell . 
   he is there to provide analysis . 
  the news are for context . 
  how is this guy an expert on brexit then ? 
  his only experience is negotiation on greece 's behalf on greek matters . 
  he then proceeds to describe how eu treated him during those greek matters negotiations ** from his biased point of view ** while not mentioning one single time what caused the negotiations to start . 
  also how can you analyze and provide context properly if the 3rd party you are discussing does not have someone present at the discussion ? 
  if the british people already know the context about greece then is safe to assume they know the context about a matter that is concerning them alot more like : brexit . 
  so why have the interview in the first place then ? 
   he was brought on this british interview specifically for brexit questions about current negotiations . 
  why is he describing his experience in negotiating with the eu on greek matters then ? 
  why have they not invited an eu official that can provide a counter argument ? 
  were not any of them in the area maybe ? 
  impossible to invite someone same day they extended the invitation for this guy ? 
  well that 's ok is 2017 i 'm sure they can get someone on a live feed ? 
  satellite link is too expensive ? 
  dude , go austerity budget and call the fucker on skype !, 
   when he talks on greek media he is criticizing greek politicians . 
  when he talks on international media why would he spent his talking time to talk about people his audience does n't even know ? 
  because any time you are criticising someone 's actions ** is relevant ** to mention the reason those actions you are criticising were taken . 
  and who created the situation that sprung those actions . 
  is called context . 
  and is mandatory to provide it if you are interested in properly informing people . 
  if you dont do that then you are discussing the consequences without the cause . 
   this idiotic statement that i see only on the internet . 
  there is not a single person in greece that is blaming only eu . 
  that is not the point i am making . 
  the point i am making is that he is on bbc ** adressing the british public ** stating that eu are such hardline blood sucking demons without mentioning the cause and its share of the blame . 
  basicly spoon feeding ** the brits ** into hating/fearing the eu . 
  makes it look like the eu is the bad guy and took such an unprecedented harsh stance regarding his country while failing to remind the british public what caused it . 
  that is not unbiased and fair assesment is circlejerk tv . 
  not to mention they are discussing the eu and its practices and politics without bothering to invite any official from it that could express eu 's point of view and , dunno , crazy thought , help the brits get a real perspective on what is going on . 
  at the very least hear both sides . 
  if i go on bbc and say i got punched in the face by a guy he is a bully right ? 
  if i then tell people he did it because i slapped his girlfriend 's ass prior to that is he still a bully ? 
  on the same degree ? 
  how many brits would go : `` well then you deserved it mate !, 
  why is he not criticizing the greek politicians that caused the crisis then and chooses to only criticize how eu figured a way to fix it ? 
  is not like he is covering for the greek politicians and only talking about how eu made him sit thru 10h long hardline negotiations . 
  how about the people responsible for those negotiations having to take place ? 
  is ok he wasnt part of the political climate when that happened but then he would of been impartial and realistic if he said : `` well the greek politicians screwed my country so bad that i had to come and help it and have to sit thru 10h long hardline negotiations with the eu '' but instead of that he only states the `` hard time '' eu gave him . 
  that makes it even worse . 
  it means he and his party were in opposition and basicly had one job : keep tabs on what the goverment is doing and tell everybody the truth as soon as posible . 
  because that would of helped both the country and theyre political aspirations . 
  a win win !, 
  but instead they chose to go along with it or , even worse , did not realise it . 
  how can these smart people in greece be so deluded to think they could close theyre eyes for decades on the huge debt they were sinking into and then come and say : '' these eu leaders went on such a hardline in negociations with us ! '' because the crisis in greece is not on the greek people is on politicians like him that should of known better but chose to go populist and tell them : '' we are just fine if it wasnt for eu and the euro we would not have been in this mess '' who made the decision to overspend for so many years in greece ? 
  brussels or athens ? 
  nah bro you would not have been in this mess if you and your coleagues would of done your job and actually inform your citizens of the real situations and take measures in due time instead of sweeping it under the rug and wait for eu to notice it .
