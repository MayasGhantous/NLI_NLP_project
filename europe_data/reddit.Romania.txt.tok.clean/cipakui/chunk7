  so basicly this interview is with a man that objectively has proven he is not able to properly manage his own country but has no problem giving advice to the people that fixed the mess he was partly responsible for . 
  gg no re . 
  meanwhile he was and still is stoking british nationalism to make brexit posible . 
  [ somehow that is fine  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/qgixzj4y3twns/giphy.gif ), 
   it was occupied for about 123 years chat spam 123, 
  meanwhile constantinople is like : `` really guys ? ... you two have a love affair while i 'm dealing with a mousquito invasion for centuries now . . '', 
  i think eu is like a kitchen . 
  it wont deliver food on its own we are the chefs in it . 
  is up to us and our abilities to work together and understand each other otherwise the food would be shit . 
  if we do manage to work together and understand each other the food will be tasty . 
  regardless of the quality of the food we manage to cook up we still have to clean the entire kitchen 3 times a day after every cooking session no slacking !, 
  basicly if you want to have it good be ready to work for it every day . 
  i like how people seem to think they are special snowflakes and reach the conclusion : eu is bad because my life is bad . 
  what has eu done for me ? 
  eu is not supposed to make your life better is supposed to guarantee you that if you work towards your happiness that is exactly what is going to happen . 
  when i say `` you work '' is not ment just in the literal sense of doing a job is actively pursuing the things that make you happy and finding a way to make a living out of it . 
  tldr : eu is an instrument is good if you play it with passion and skill . 
  is shit if you dont make any effort in learning how it works or dont bother to tune it before attepting to make art . 
  uk is just autotune , 
  i will take that any day over the actual reason which was : oil , 
  so one cheek is in the open and the other one is covered ? 
   what hapends if we are not talking about the face cheeks ? 
  true . 
  i made somewhere in this thread a post about risk assesment and why it doesnt make sense to sell your best tech to someone that is at reasonable risk of becoming an enemy . 
  italy is not in same league with romania or bulgaria risk assesment wise . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67ublt/bulgaria_opts_for_swedish_gripen_combat_jets/dgtiyhe/?context=3 ), 
  the us goverment doesnt give a shit if romania bought f 's or gripen . 
  the people that give us politicians money to become the goverment there are the people that build the jets and they do care if romania puts money in theyre pocket instead of sweden 's pocket . 
  so they are de facto the goverment and we are paying them . 
  bulgaria is not . 
  you can choose to think it does not make any difference and i can choose to think it does . 
  at this point is a matter of agree to disagree because you ignore my arguments that explain why your argument of better value per dollar spend does not matter in the grand scheme of things . 
  so we are in a deadlock . 
  why would we choose to continue this ? 
  are you high ? 
   is not at all better but that is not the criteria that matters when purchasing them . 
  i just explained to you why in the post above . 
  read . 
  okay i see i have no choice but to spoon feed you  so here goes :  when purchasing high level military hardware the bang per buck is absolutely the most important aspect false or only from the seller 's perspective . 
  allow me to go into detail : by buying us shit romania now has joined the club , is one of the boys . 
  has become in the eyes of us corp. a paying customer . 
  bulgaria got same thing in sweden . 
  now , we all recall trumps stances during the campain and imediately after elections . 
  now is changing them nato is no longer absolete and uk is on the back queue for a us trade deal that will negotiate with the eu instead . 
  now i dont supose you think that when angela was having a tete-a - tete with trump she went : `` oh donnie if you could just grab my pussy for a second the instant intimate connection will transfer all the info you need to change your mind '' now here is what hapened : the execs that run the corp that makes the f 's now sees romania as a paying customer also they employ heavy hitting slick lobbyist that have the ear of every politician in us from the president to the lowest senate member , any comitee under the sun , every defense comitee . 
  and they are the ones that starved trump from passing laws by controling the senate and they are the ones that influence the us foreign policy . 
  and now they are directly invested in having romania stable and buying shit . 
  if you wake me up at night and ask me how would i like romania to become : more like swe or more like us i would choose swe in a heartbeat but swe doesnt have the same security guarantees like us can provide . 
  so bulgarian politicians being indecisive with going with russia or us chose the neutral swe connection that doesnt give them anything but very good jets . 
  meanwhile romania is a milking cow in the eyes of us corp. and so the cow must be kept ** fed and safe ** so she gives ... more ... come on ... you can do it ... you guessed it ! ... 
  m i l k. i can has slow clap now plox ? 
   also previous ciolos goverment struck a deal with germany to buy top tier troop transporters that were to be built in romania in a romanian/german new factory . 
  now that plan was scrapped new goverment announced we are buying us transporters . 
  same previous goverment made a deal to build 3 state of the art new warships in romanian city of gala\u021bi 's shipyard owned by a dutch company . 
  new goverment canceled that deal . 
  get some perspective stop being naive , 
   it 's better to buy european so that the money stays in the union . 
  hello eurofighter ? 
  is not our call tho, 
   this is a factual question and you 're avoiding it because you ca n't actually answer it . 
  yes i can : i mentioned galileo or davinci because they were stating facts based on things they knew and proven to be true while everybody around them were negating those facts based on what they thought to be true . 
  all of you base your assesment of which made the right purchase on value per dollar but that is the naive way to look at it . 
  in my opinion . 
  because when purchasing high level military hardware that criteria does not come even in top 5 . 
   because we know how that ends i loled at that one thanks . 
  also here is something you guys dont understand : if for instance sweden would want to buy f-35 's they would get them beause they are considered solid ground . 
  if a country like romania or bulgaria would want to buy f-35 's they would go with the f-16 's story because they are not considered to be such a sure thing compared to sweden . 
  is called risk assesment and this involves not only political reasons . 
  a country with romania or bulgaria 's economy and social situation derived from that would be alot more prone to major political systems shifts . 
  heck is not even 30 years since we were enemies of us . 
  so why would you sell your top tech to someone who is vulnerable to becoming enemy ? 
  they already have the experience of turkey . 
  i dont play tennis either . 
  takes one to know one . 
  have a great day !, 
  because muricans wont sell you the f-35s directly and unde the false pretenses of platform knowledge and experience they make you buy the old planes first . 
  so you just dance . 
  also why is noone taking gripen being taken over by a hostile lego jet fighter denmark theory of mine seriouslly ? 
  we would thats a non issue . 
  ask this question to galileo or davinci . 
  where they right ? 
  yes . 
  did people agree with them ? 
  why not ? 
  it was ** then me ** quoting ** past me ** so ** technically ** it was ** not same me ** , 
   i 'd speculate that from an overall ( pilot training , maintenance , etc. ), 
  perspective the step from gripen to f-35 is n't any bigger than from f-16 . 
  that is perhaps true . 
  but we both know that in today 's world the actual technical and value per dollar advantage is a minor role in decision making . 
  we are talking about advanced weapon systems political and corporate interests are heavy punching here . 
  both romania and bulgaria can not win a war versus russia right now on theyre own or even both allied to one another . 
  it doesnt matter if they have 50 gripens each or 50 f-16 or 50 f-35 's or 50 f-69 's ... i feel like you got the point but i kept going because i wanted to write f-69  is like buying the playstation because most of your friends have it over the xbox and nintendo . 
  maybe solo play you would have most fun with nintendo . 
  but you dont buy a console for solo play . 
  thank you for a very comprehensive answer . 
  [ this is what makes f16 a better choice ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67ublt/bulgaria_opts_for_swedish_gripen_combat_jets/dgte0hg/?context=3 ),

  basicly countries that dont want to upset russia 's feelings buy gripen , 
  no they are not . 
  not in the long run .
