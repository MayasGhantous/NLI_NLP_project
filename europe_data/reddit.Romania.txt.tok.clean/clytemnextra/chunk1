it 's lunatics like timmermans that drive me further down the political right . 
  who the fuck even gives this guy the right to make public statements ? 
   `` it 's shocking to see the extent of fgm here in the uk . 
  we 've seen hugely increased attention on this problem in the past few years and we are now waking up to the scale of this terrible practice . '', 
  you should 've listened when france warned you years ago . 
  all i see in the article is talk of data , figures , charities . 
  any word on when they 're going to arrest the parents and figure out if any of the `` surgeons '' operate in the uk ? 
  their shock seems very wishy-washy to me . 
  er , no i did not refer to islam at all ? 
  we were n't even * talking * about immigrants , go back and read . 
  i still do n't get why you 're trumping on about this . 
  it ca n't be that i 've argued my country should n't take in any refugees , because i 've said the opposite . 
  and it ca n't be that the ro government has said we should n't take any , because they have n't said that either . 
  so you 're pulling your frustration out of your ass , and should probably take it elsewhere . 
  westerners love to judge east europeans though , do n't pretend . 
  it 's one of the few minorities you can rant about without worrying that you 'll be called racist , so spare me . 
  er , i 'm just telling you to explain why you took a 180 turn and started going on about secular syrians at random ? 
  i 'm not arguing anything , i 'm just trying to figure out what the hell you 're talking about at this point , or how you think it 's relevant to the exchange so far . 
  lol u sure bout that first one , bro ? 
   the official religion in afghanistan is islam , which is practiced by over 99 % of its citizens . 
  and either way , so what ? 
  or is changing the subject your way of admitting defeat in an argument . 
  a ) how many of them are syrian again ? 
  did i dream up that 20 % number ? 
  b ) so ? 
  not if those ` some ' are few . 
  but if throughout 50 years you see more of a certain kind of behaviour , you eventually learn your lesson . 
  yep , and human trafficking is never done by any other group of white people . 
  nope . 
  / s it 's not ` only the gypsis ' , but if you think they 're not a huge part of organised crime you 're too ignorant to be in this conversation . 
  as if . 
  women do n't harrass other women for wearing short skirts , do n't paw them in public transport , and they do n't tend to rape them either . 
  meanwhile , the only thing men have to fear from them is ... feminists , mostly . 
  the more i learn about men , the more i wish to forget . 
  having a certain citizenship does n't mean you 'll also take up the culture of the place . 
  culture is more closely linked to ethnicity . 
  and it 's culture that motivates people to behave this way or that . 
  so citizenship is n't all that relevant if you want to talk behaviour . 
  a syrian can be an ` islamist terrorist ' . 
  whereas gypsies and romanians are two completely different * ethnic * and cultural groups . 
  there 's also at least one booklet with info about most european countries for illegal migrants , and it has an [ online version ] ( http://w2eu.info/index.en.html ) . 
  lol ` course . 
  have fun with it . 
  a co-national of mine admires the germanic culture of binge drinking and pissing in public , he thinks it 's a sign of `` civilization '' . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.toomanymornings.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/no_country_for_old_men_tommy_lee_jones.jpg ) . 
  * if people want to apply for asylum in my country , they 're welcome just like they 've always been welcome . 
  we have our own refugee policy and we 've had it for decades and it 's never caused anyone any trouble . 
  * if germany wants to come in and tell us how many people should be dumped on us ( like they 're a sack of potatoes ) germany can absolutely positively shove it up its ass . 
  * it 's not about migrants or refugees or a lack of desire to help syrians . 
  it 's about national autonomy and sovereignty , and us being *** really *** sick of being told by `` greater countries '' how our demographics should look . 
  western countries never had this happen to them , so they have reserves of patience . 
  central/east european countries lost their patience for this practice a long time ago ( thanks stalin ) . 
  for me none ( heathenous coke drinker ) . 
  but my dad always has wine and my mother always has beer  maybe not for lunch at work , but definitely for dinner at home . 
  not really scared ( mind you that cafe shooting was just a few streets away from a lady i 'm friends with , who was also pregnant at the time ; it 's just natural to worry ) . 
  but denmark is the second largest european source of jihadist fighters going to the middle east . 
  so if danish intelligence says this or that is n't going on , i do n't think i 'm going to take their word for granted . 
  that 's all . 
  the same danish intelligence that could n't foresee that dude that shot up a cafe in broad daylight before strolling down to the synagogue to shoot some more ? 
  [ this is more than i even expected . 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/461/271/aba.jpg ), 
  lol no . 
  westerners complained to us for ages that ` we could n't integrate them right ' ( when literally every other minority , from palestinians to chinese and people from all over africa manage to integrate perfectly ) . 
  now that you get them , you realise it ai n't so easy to integrate a group of people who is n't interested . 
  good fucking luck . 
  my uni was pretty good actually , but i attended one whose chancellor is the archbishop of canterbury . 
  racial diversity was ok but was not given special treatment , and diversity of opinion was never suppressed . 
  i guess all those crosses kept the wolf from the door , never met a muslim extremist in all my time there , and even the black and brown students tended to be coptic christians instead . 
  now that i think about it , most of my problems were with [ very secual ] black londoner girls , haha . 
  and their being black was just incidental , but they sure loved going out , getting drunk then making a mess when they got back . 
  i 'll take the copts over that any day . 
  i wonder who raised them . 
  i think it 's just [ polarization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polarization_\\ ( psychology \\ ) ) taking place as the conversations spiral on , and a lot of the anti-immigration group is compensating for how one-sided the media is , rather than being actually against accepting asylum seekers . 
  like , i 'm cool with my country 's immigration intake , for both regular migrants and asylum seekers , which we 've had for decades from various continents with nobody complaining . 
  but as soon as you add west-european overlords and media not even pretending to not be one-sided , i lose my chill , and ` anti-immigrant ' is just the group name that 's closest to where i stand even though it 's still a misnomer . 
  no , that was n't my point . 
  it 's about their ` poor vulnerables ' bias , typically followed by emotional blackmail \u00e0 la ` how can you stand to watch children drown ?!, 
  ' , which depend on their not being explicitly aware of the real percentages . 
  and when confronted with the numbers , their enthusiasm falters or they go into denial . 
  that 's what i was talking about . 
  but i 'm just talking about rl discussions . 
  how does that follow ? 
  i 'm just talking about perceived gender distribution . 
  `` united in diversity '' my ass . 
  sometimes they do , sometimes they do n't . 
  same . 
  highly educated professionals a few generations older than me find it very dodgy , not least because it seems to have come all of a sudden , like a dam broke somewhere . 
  i 'm not sure i buy it either , but they 've lived through more than i have , i do n't think they 're all just naive or crazy . 
  they do n't think all of them are , but they either think * most * of them are , or do n't think about it at all . 
  the pro-immigration people i 've argued with face-to-face , when i asked them if they knew how many of the migrants were men , they gave me a blank look for a moment before answering `` i dunno '' . 
  they literally never thought about it , they just rolled on the media wave with the pictures of women and babies . 
  well when you marry your kids off at age 13 and would stab someone for a cigarette , that kind of attitude builds up . 
  but it 's not like there 's a looming civil war or genocide or anything that would validate the complaints they 've made to gain asylum . 
  nope . 
  we should n't be surprised . 
  200 years ago they would 've been met with pitchforks for going against popular opinion to this degree . 
  politicians have never been physically safer than in the modern era , and this allows them to sell their country to satan for a corn chip . 
  / armchair anthropology, 
  but our last referendum was er ... sort of disregarded completely by the eu . 
  fancy that .
