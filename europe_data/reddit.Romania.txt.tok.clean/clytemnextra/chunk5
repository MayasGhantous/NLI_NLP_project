  it 's supremely discouraging . 
  and what 's worse is that this attitude builds on the [ learned helplessness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/learned_helplessness ) gained during the commie years , when the citizens tried to bring democracy back , and found themselves either shot or tortured in prison , again and again . 
  and like seligman 's dogs , people learned to be powerless and stayed that way for two generations , and some are raising a third generation to think the same way . 
  i think it will take for my generation to get into politics with a fresh , more empowered way of thinking , before anything substantial changes . 
   i 've yet to hear a plausible explanation as to how someone can `` demand '' to cross a border feast your ears : https://youtu.be/guzd2sf7sos?t=22m, 
  50 years of savage political survivalism , for one thing . 
  you do n't just get rid of that culture when it raised the whole current generation of politicians , while the west was getting to grips with democracy and by now has it in a more mature form . 
  not to mention that almost all eastern intellectuals , aristocracy and nobility were wiped out , while again the west kept theirs and they could contribute to the growth of their societies . 
  westerners seem to be painfully naive about psychological realities in the east . 
  mind you there 's no implication the eu is the corrupting agent . 
  it 's , again , simply * complacent * . 
  different meanings . 
  western politicians are corrupt too , make no mistake , but they have the decency to be more delicate about their theft . 
  implying we do n't . 
  but the eu not only just let them do their thing , but in some instances even protected them against the wishes of the people . 
  it 's not hard to see why ; corrupt people are more malleable than those with integrity . 
  so the eu too are to blame for being complacent when they have all the resources to carry out anti-corruption investigations . 
  those motherfuckers are hurting the horses . 
  all those bastards should be deported , they do n't even deserve the cushy prisons in sweden . 
  i almost ca n't believe they tried to argue they were n't safe in serbia . 
  every clause in there is golden . 
  would n't do it , denmark . 
  there 's no telling how long it lasts , and who will be in power in dk when the war ends . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  the point is that the eu knows it . 
  they know a lot of the money ends up in pockets rather than infrastructure . 
  so for them to threaten to ` cut the funding ' , it 's not a threat to the citizens but to the politicians who would end up with less to steal . 
  dirty all over . 
  so proud our reps actually kept their word too . 
  they actually were n't pussies . 
  respect . 
  not for merkel , it seems . 
  oh gee , like it 's such a bad idea to reject people who have already * broken the law * . 
  the guardian can go choke on some pork sausage . 
  i came here to say the exact same thing ( except that it 's a good idea ) . 
  the timing though is just precious . 
  so they wo n't stay and fight for their own country , and their first attitude to europe is to disrespect it . 
  a great start . 
   and i think we have been fairly successful keeping people in the different countries where they chose to go , because this is what is important to us . 
  dublin ii says [ which country ] is responsible - we do n't care . 
  because if a refugee says `` i want to go to scandinavia , say sweden , because my aunt is living there '' , ok you have a good reason to go to sweden . 
  why should you argue with us ? 
  this whole speech , man ... 
  they had it coming . \u2122, 
  idk , we focused quite a bit on cuza . 
  i guess it depends on the school or maybe the teacher ? 
  get ready for rage though , because vlad tepes was one of the most marvellous rules we ever had . 
  and if you do n't agree you can choke on it :p, 
  commie gulags were kinda worse , and lasted longer . 
  my grandparents are leagues more progressive than any of the muslims at that conference , dude . 
  swallow that cynicism down . 
  [ for the whole of europe , the annual export value of all german products amounts to $ 851 billion . 
  ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/ ) [ in 2011 59.2 per cent of german exports were delivered to member states of the european union . 
  ] ( http://www.conmoto-consulting.com/share-of-german-exports-to-eu-countries-at-20-year-low/ ), 
  in all but name . 
  when you vote for a party or a coalition , you * know * who will end up mp . 
  yeah , not directly , which is ... dodgy as all hell . 
  i 'm not satisfied with this process , personally . 
  direct elections would be much better . 
  otherwise you would n't need presidential elections at all , you could just vote town mayors or something , which would then vote a president for the whole country . 
  i have a feeling if that process were suggested at the national level , it would n't go well . 
  more like a monarch actually . 
  the people of europe did not elect juncker , nor any other president of the commission . 
  it 's unfortunate for us that unlike a real monarch , juncker was n't * raised * to rule anyone . 
  you can really tell that lately . 
  ahaha i did n't even realize that when i wrote it !, 
  it * is * kinda funny . 
  a. i. cuza was a voivode that got elected in both the moldavian and valachian principalities , thereby achieving a political/constitutional unification into an early romanian state . 
  / history lesson, 
  fear is one of the biggest motivators , isis are not stupid . 
  and we also have to admit that this mass-migratory experiment has n't been very propitious . 
  what is for most of these people their first experience of europe ? 
  that they can charge through across borders and if they scream loudly enough and if they march in large enough numbers , the laws will bend for them because the politicians and the police are weak . 
  we really could n't fault them if they laughed in our faces , when this is the impression we give to them ( and the rest of the world ) . 
  so with fear of being mistreated ( in their opinion ) by the local authorities , combined with the disrespect some people might have developed from their first impressions of europe , you could whip up a pretty neat cocktail . 
  poor brothers . 
  i hope they do n't quit until their demands are met . 
  their political class is badly in need of some jail time . 
   media one sided lol u do n't say but yeah , agreed . 
  the western media is basically trying to push people into a [ spiral of silence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiral_of_silence ) , and they 're trying so hard it 's downright creepy . 
  thankful there 's places online to talk about this stuff openly ( the comment section on the guardian are always better than the articles themselves ) . 
  do n't mean to criticise the west now , but during the easteuro anxiety , the media was all over it and not ashamed to portray those migrants in a bad light . 
  so this double standard becomes really gross when seen in this context . 
  good luck with your letter of complaint . 
  i hope more readers write to them as well . 
  [ article 3 ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0sba3 )  ( 4 ) no foreign populations may be displaced or colonized on the territory of the romanian state . 
   my point though was exactly what you 're saying : `` one '' . 
  the argument that ` oh it works in the us =  the rest of the world is exactly the same . ', 
  that 's americentric nonsense . 
  we do n't live in the us , we live in europe . 
   one [ really ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia_patrols ) [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=vf1fz-cr0v4 ) [ just one ? 
  ] ( http://www.vocativ.com/world/germany-world/germanys-sharia-police/ ) my point though was exactly what you 're saying : `` one '' . 
  the argument that ` oh it works in the us =  the rest of the world is exactly the same . ', 
  that 's americentric nonsense . 
  we do n't live in the us , we live in europe . 
  the same thing danes mean when they talk of 2nd gen danes . 
  people who are considered to be ` not real danes ' . 
  you know exactly how that goes , it 's no secret a lot of danes think this way even about immigrants from other scandi countries .
