for my country it was n't even easy to join nato . 
  our security situation was pretty precarious in the '90s : internal ethnic conflict in 1990 , economy down the toilet , bordering two states in dissolution ( yugoslavia & ussr ) , hungary starting its integration into the west early , etc. 
  our policy changed from the old ` lets play all sides but mostly my side ' ( west vs east , soviet union vs china , etc ) to a clear choice for the west by mid-90s , but we were n't invited to join until the second enlargement post warsaw pact dissolution . 
  i can not describe the frustration e.g. 
  during the kosovo war that despite our position we still had no good security . 
  so yeah , it 's not that nato took us over , instead we pulled really hard to extend the nato blanket to cover our asses . 
  the [ danube-bucharest canal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube%e2%80%93bucharest_canal ) , first envisaged 1864 , 60-70 % built in the 1980s , then abandoned . 
  there 's some talk of restarting the project . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  there is a provision for temporary border controls , but it 's not generally used . 
  as a romanian ( non-schengen but eu , same as uk ) i can also show the national id card instead of a passport , for all eu . 
  edit : and the id only gets checked when you enter the schengen area via one of its borders , then you can go wherever without additional checks , indeed . 
  schengen is about ( lack of ) internal border controls & common visa policy . 
  at this point it 's used as a political stick , does n't affect person movement at all ( only transport still gets stuck in customs ) . 
  those are votes . 
  with redistribution ( ? ), 
  they have 66.83 % of the seats . 
  edit : yes , i noticed afterwards , sorry . 
   subsidized minimal public service got romania 1gb optical fiber everywhere . 
  except a ) there was no subsidy whatsoever and b ) it 's definitely not everywhere . 
  subsidies ( not exactly , but let 's call them that ) are just now coming in for the very first time , to ensure coverage in rural areas . 
  edit : and i fully expect it will turn to shit , because it grants the contractor a monopoly on the built infrastructure , there wo n't be any competition . 
  it was so far strictly free market . 
  feel free to believe whatever statist bullshit you desire , but do n't misrepresent facts . 
  interesting . 
  our constitutional court killed a similar law . 
  first one does n't sound romanian ( ? ) . 
  anyway , this is my pick : [ romanian police storming an appartment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u0cchtpjgg ) ( 13:03 ) . 
  not so good does n't mean unsafe . 
  i drink tap water in bucharest when i 'm lazy , but i * prefer * bottled . 
  tap is somewhat smelly from chlorination and possibly piping , people get bottled for quality , not safety . 
  [ calarasi-silistra ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdosp9b.jpg ) is where romania & bulgaria should be in schengen first . 
  having the bridge land on the romanian right bank would mean a much longer bridge , having it land in bulgaria would be incovenient for romanians . 
  i would totally have a use for this bridge , 
  as long as the government does n't see this idea . 
  considering an average sallary of 500 $ and a gigabit home connection you ccould be bankrupt in 3 hours :-), 
  nah , it 's less than 1.3 % households without electricity , doubt it makes a mark . 
  industrial consumption should be bigger anyway . 
  interesting thing , i 'll try to dig some data . 
  your electricity consumption is almost twice that of romania , i had a question about that [ removed ] but then realized it 's per capita . 
  still , how come it 's so high , any idea ? 
  that was just a talking point , i 'm fairly certain sikorski was n't taking zhirinovski 's [ `` offer '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsm2j/putins_coup_how_the_russian_leader_used_the/clev9mf ) at face value . 
  it was zhirinovski , as usual . 
  unless you believe that he 's a tool for `` testing the waters '' . 
  it 's not a very big deal for romania either , except maybe short term for dacia ( they assemble kits in russia too , so maybe not even that ) . 
  trade with russia is something like 3 % of total . 
  heh , that could kill most of what we export to russia ( cars 35 % , electrical machines and equipment 27.5 % ) , some $ 1.8 b total . 
  and i wonder what will happen to the russian owned metallurgical plants they did n't manage to bankrupt yet . 
  both . 
  in 1930 there were 750k , in 1948 340k , in 1977 360k , in 1992 110k , in 2002 60k . 
  so yeah , [ ww2 and 90s . 
  ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanii_din_rom%c3%a2nia ), 
  that was tongue in cheek . 
  a lot of romanians will vote for him as well [ he 's second in polls ] . 
  after ceausescu literally sold germans to germany , a lot left in the '90s . 
  there is still a small german minority ( ~ 50.000 ) , but it 's much less relevant than it used to be ( ~ 1 mil ) . 
  one of them is a presidential candidate . 
  the other will vote for him !, 
  that 's just like romania cca . 
  and they 're working on harmonization , mainly by blindly copying romanian law ( which is exactly what we did back then ) . 
  there 's nothing wrong with the german registration . 
  also , it 's quite possible they live in germany most of the time . 
  a [ well publicised case ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqtpqydndjy#t=20 ) ( ro ) is that of a gypsy gang that bought most of the historical buildings in timisoara . 
  it 's actually the exact opposite . 
  your mistake is taking a few vocal opinions on reddit as anything representative . 
  actual nationwide polls show overwhelming support in romania (  80 % , if you need a source i can find ) , much much less in moldova ( as in : not a majority ) . 
  we are not pushing for it , though . 
  light blue is extremely common in dobrogea , as well as blue window frames/doors . 
  one version i 've heard is it 's mosquito repellant , but pretty sure it 's an urban legend as it repels nothing , 
  i do n't know if there 's much of a continuum before/after slavery was abolished . 
  when they were `` set free '' they were also often expelled and deprived of survival means ( that was provided by their `` owner '' and was often the reason they would fall into slavery in the first place ) . 
  when `` encouraged '' to settle , they met unwelcoming communities , same as everywhere in europe earlier . 
  this was , along with the lack of any compensation , one of the big problems with the reform . 
  anyway , the point was that it 's not only the recent rich gypsies that we `` hate '' , it 's not like the poor were/are all that welcomed either . 
   weirdly enough the hate that is directed towards them in the country is mostly directed towards the rich ones eh , come on , this is ridiculous . 
  how do you think villages got segregated in the first place ? 
  or even completely cut off like this one . 
   ponta 's administration next door is riddled with corruption , yet he was in the us just last month . 
  `` so today i ask their leaders : how can you sleep under your nato article 5 blanket at night while pushing `` illiberal democracy '' by day ; whipping up nationalism ; restricting free press ; or demonizing civil society !, 
  ** i ask the same of those who shield crooked officials from prosecution ; bypass parliament when convenient ; or cut dirty deals ** that increase their countries ' dependence on one source of energy despite their stated policy of diversification . '', 
  yes . 
  `` approximately 80 roma families live in the village , but they do n't know romani language and did n't keep their traditions ( hard to estimate their number , as some of them do n't have documents ) . 
  if you ask them , they won ' t be able to answer when they settled here , but their neighbors in araci say that 50-60 years ago roma families started arriving in hetea . 
  as their numbers grew , romanians nearby left and they remained isolated on the hill '', 
  in the early '90s we had street merchants with `` gaufre de liege '' ( some franchise , they were all the same ) , it 's how i learned both about gaufre and that liege is in belgium  but it was novelty back then , right now you 're probably right , no connection . 
  nah , that pic is pure gold !, 
   in bucharest , the air quality has `` improved '' because the reporting stations do n't work or only work part of the time . 
  most are from the ruling party actually , at least the big names like this one . 
  a lot are old cases , e.g. 
  the facts here are from 2001-2006 . 
  the prosecutors started in 2007 , could not do much because he was a mp , case brought to court in 2009 , returned to the prosecutors in 2011 on faulty procedure , started again in 2013 . 
  that spans 4 election cycles and 2 changes in majority . 
  recently , it 's a lot faster . 
  sadly , he 's right . 
  you must be new to this subreddit . 
  just wait for the next `` stalin was not all bad '' thread . 
  i was probably unclear in my second remark . 
  i think him showing up as president of romania to one of our * allied countries * after having potentially spied on them might be awkward . 
  more so , if you think how complicated 1997-2001 were for our foreign policy and as a consequence our intelligence services . 
  100 % agree with your other points .
