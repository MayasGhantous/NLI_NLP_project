  if moscow * really * wanted and asked nicely  , we 'd have been all over prague too . 
  `` i did n't quite get the other things you 're babbling about though , sorry . '', 
  edit : part of my family greatly benefited from this freedom of movement . 
  given such a huge opportunity they relocated everywhere in the soviet union , but they chose undisclosed locations in siberia the most , of all places . 
  those fuckers , did n't even call back !, 
  in compensation , some russian dudes mixed freely in their previous homes , so i guess you 're on to something there . 
  let me spell it for you then : i 'm going to put these russians inside their little republic , so i can protect their interests with my army . 
  does it ring any bell now ? 
  oh , please . 
  it 's not like you dislike having your navy sit in ukraine . 
  or an army in transnistria . 
  forget georgia . 
  or chechnya . 
  or all of the lovely `` melting pot '' places the ussr has created . 
  `` soviet people '' my ass . 
  that was the effect of the '30 crisis , when agricultural exports were screwed , and we were doing something like 80 % agri . 
  you 'll notice gdp/capita did not recover to 1913 levels . 
  if you 're going to cherry-pick ... ninja edit : http://europeaneconomics.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/romania-during-the-great-depression-a-few-familiar-echoes/ i am not idealizing pre-ww2 romania , but it really is more complicated than `` we were always backward '' . 
   romania was pretty backward berfore communism , too ( compared to western countries ) . 
  that 's [ nonsense ] ( http://www.cepr.org/meets/wkcn/1/1699/papers/broadberry_klein.pdf ) . 
  it was n't as rich , yes , but definitely not backward , and developing nicely . 
  we had a fairly modern state , industry had recovered after the '30s crisis which hit it hard ( only to get into a war , meh ) agricultural output was great , etc. 
  with a proper economy , the social issues that were prevalent would have been fixable . 
  there 's no way of knowing `` what if '' the communist disaster did n't happen , but fwiw my prediction is significantly different from yours . 
  nope , dobrogea . 
  in a rather small and remote village , everybody got these for free from the council : http://i.imgur.com/ev5pvfc.jpg that was 2 years ago . 
  one year ago they actually started collecting the trash :-) i think it would actually be a lot easier there to sort and recycle than in the city , exactly because of the lack of existing infrastructure . 
  most organic waste is being used ( animal food , compost , or what not ) , trash is mostly plastic/paper/metal . 
  compare with the single dumpster arrangement in an apartment bloc . 
  the tractor and trailer that picks up the trash every thursday really does throw everything in a big pile . 
  what about timezones ? 
  that 's fairly well recognized . 
  utc = western europe , utc +1 central , utc +2 eastern , utc +3 there be dragons . 
  not `` ew '' at all , we have [ jum\u0103ri ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gtrlwcwb76g/tuofxi3z00i/aaaaaaaabym/yei8uhzf6r4/s1600/jumari+005.jpg ) out of pork or geese fat . 
  we also eat that smoked , as [ sl\u0103nin\u0103 ] ( http://combis.infoaliment.ro/photo/combis/slanina-afumata-info994.jpg ) with mandatory onions and a shot of \u021buic\u0103 .

  [ sarmale ] ( http://www.gaben.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/sarmale.jpg ) ( this comes in two rather different styles , it 's ground meat and rice in cabbage or vine leaves , served with sour cream ) . 
  these are not necessarily everyday food , but certainly stuff you 'd expect every now and then , and they 're well known . 
  if you visit romania and are in a good restaurant , try them out . 
  american-style beef steak is pretty good . 
  we make it more bland here . 
  it 's not the `` what keys do i press '' kind of usability . 
  the whole `` you just need to exchange keys '' is a hassle even with a keyserver , when you 're not dealing with the same set of people regularly . 
  there is no easy solution for groups ( e.g. 
  mailing lists ) . 
  it 's up to you if these hassles are worth it for the [ extra security ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png ), 
  it 's both sides doing the checking , `` buddy '' . 
  yeah , swiping a passport in a reader is so much harder over the border . 
  the only valid point you could make would have been that since we have external eu border we 'd allow outside criminals in , and it 's not like that is n't happening now either . 
  so i take it that the schengen police border patrol thing you do n't fucking want removed does n't exactly fucking work , does it ? 
   a lot of people have some hungarian ancestry even here in bucharest ... as proven by y-dna and mt-dna statistical studies plus the fact that anarchisto 's gf is part hungarian , which must mean something , right ? 
  that i admit , in only [ 20 years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c4%83d%c4%83reni_riots ) you people have made [ tremendous progress ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285796/romanian-gypsies-living-condemned-ghetto-mayor-built-wall-around.html ) !, 
  about that [ stereotype ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/fi%c8%99ier:rromi_2011_jud.png ) ... 
  are you not talking about [ these ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:covrigi-brasonveni.jpg ) ? 
  i 'm confused as i never saw a stuffed one - just soft on the inside , crunchy on the outside , hot from the oven , poppy + rough salt , yumm . 
   are they learning how to code ? 
  think turtle graphics & the like . 
  you 're not actually writing code , but you 're learning how functions compose to get some result . 
  i still vividly remember this as my first a-ha !, 
  moment in programming : when i figured that drawing increasing radius circles in a loop will get me a solid circle . 
  i was 8-9 ( 3rd grade ) , learning some basic , without a computer at home . 
  imho , starting as early as 5 with some simple things nowadays is really good . 
  do n't call it coding if you do n't want to , but it can certainly be closer to that than writing html :p, 
  the cremwursts ( `` polonezi '' ) i guess you need to be over 30 for this one , 
  zubrowka is way better , this contest is retarded . 
  * electricity : you must be blind , they 're replacing wiring everywhere . 
  it is exactly the old state network that 's toast , coupled with increased demand . 
  this has been a problem for a long time , it is disingenuous to blame it on lack of investment now . 
  * water : speak for yourself . 
  i also pay 1.5 ron/m3 someplace other than bucharest . 
  pumping station used eu money , but pipes and all are privately financed . 
  there was n't any before . 
  * phone * internet * cable tv what did the romans ever do for us ? 
  there are also somewhat specialized jobs in construction that are traditionally roma things , like sheet iron roofing , water drainage ( `` burlane '' ) , etc. 
  few of them are left practicing , but in a rural environment they 're still sought for these unique skills . 
  from personal experience , i have a tzuica still that needed some repair , it was n't done right ( three attempts ) until i found the right gypsy to do it . 
  what i 'm saying is , they do n't only do unskilled labour , sometimes they 're really masters of craft . 
  these people do exist !, 
  a2 is done . 
  so we do have . 
  one :p like in this old joke : did you hear , a mig has crashed ? 
  yes , too bad . 
  but we have another one . 
  til , thanks . 
  i could have sworn gora = mountain after some toponyms . 
  heh , it 's literally `` made like the post '' , and means getting passed from one guy to the next ( fairly common expression ) . 
  i suppose it has to do with how the post works from station to station ? 
  ptiu !, 
  fuck your mother 's gods and easters and christs you stinking pig , with your whore mother and your jailed father and your whole family in the mad house . 
  may i see your swollen eyes in a coffin and your wife gang raped ( lit : posted ) in the cemetery !, 
  go away you damned fatso !, 
  i 'm not in scandinavia but i 'll let you know it 's lisp and not lisp :p, 
   here , do n't take my word for it : http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/romania-could-export-gas-from-2013 that 's wishful thinking . 
  inb4 http://www.anre.ro/activitati.php?id=1094 it would have been nice to have another option than buying russian gas from the `` smart guys '' , for which we do pay more than the average .
