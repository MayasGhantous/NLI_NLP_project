  edit : i mean , of course we could export for a better price , but then we 'd have to import more . 
  watch me cheer for that . 
  not . 
  gooood . 
  then you understand why nobody will `` grub up '' one until it reaches old age . 
  do you even know what a vineyard looks like ? 
  for a more successul strawman , try to avoid cliches . 
  all i said was the claim that the driver went madrid to bucharest and back is dubious at best , i never disputed that accident ( s ) happen . 
  driving and rest hours are metered , there 's eu-wide rules about that . 
  atlassib is one of the larger and older companies , they would no longer be in business if they did that . 
  you also have at least two drivers on long routes . 
  you ca n't go more than 2-300km and not risk a road check ( cue lorry cb traffic ) . 
  i ca n't find some accident numbers to back me up , so feel free to disbelieve . 
  i do however travel by bus 2-4 times a month as i do n't have a car , and the change is quite obvious . 
  some 10 years ago you would n't catch me near one of those things . 
   the driver was coming from spain and when he arrived to romania , they did n't let him sleep and just ordered him to drive the return trip as well . 
  unless this was in the wild '90s , highly unlikely . 
  they tend to take their job seriously these days . 
  their [ national anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iawpfckzan4 ) [ himni i flamurit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himni_i_flamurit ) is a romanian patriotic song . 
  turns out some of their inteligentsia hanged out in bucharest at the start of 20th century . 
  the principality of albania was also established after the treaty of bucharest ( 1913 ) . 
  albanian sounds eerily familiar in intonation and we share some ancient words ( illyrians ? ) . 
  very warm people - at least the few i 've met . 
   it 's another to hand the monopoly on an essential government service over to a single corporate entity . 
  private operators do exist though , and the large market share ( ~ 75 % ) of cfr marfa + gfr is being scrutinied by the anti-trust regulator . 
  this is not really the problem . 
  the problem is they botched the privatization so hard that a single contestant remained in the tender , and he won  even deducting commercial debt ( government debt was conveniently erased ) , it looks like a profit can be made by simply selling the assets for cash . 
  we 're only giving you the [ opportunity to fix it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8yj1jo-f6q ) . 
  [ 588 ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/parlamentul_rom%c3%a2niei#membri ) is closer to 600 than to 550 . 
  * most western point in the azores * unlike spanish , romanians do n't understand a word of spoken portuguese ( written is another story ) * jose saramago * pay your debts :p, 
  well , it 's about 1 $ in romania ( for households ) . 
  considering that basic cable with tens of channels is less that 6 $ incl . 
  vat , it 's still too much . 
  our public tv was `` restructured '' instead , last year . 
  they closed the two better channels ( tvr cultural and tvr info ) and laid off some 600 people  with 6 channels remaining , it 's still a waste . 
  closing it and reopening was only half-jokingly proposed , but it 's not necessarily the worst path . 
  romanian authorities are expecting a peak of 10500 m3/s around june 13-15 , lower than the 11900 m3/s we had in april at bazia\u0219 ( point of entry ) . 
  they 're not expecting any damage and are only doing some dam inspections as a precaution . 
  we 'll see if they 're on crack or not , this is what they said yesterday . 
  edit : 1/3 of danube basin is in romania , and we did n't get nowhere near as much rain . 
  yeah , was looking at just that with some friends , somebody sure did some homework there . 
  very impressive . 
  many view bulgaria as having somewhat nicer beaches plus better and cheaper services , turkey & greece as much nicer and not so much more expensive . 
  in comparison , our seaside is a bit boring unless you go out of your way to more secluded places . 
  but it 's still full in the summer , so it 's not a rule for everyone . 
  i think he 's speaking of national level funding only , as state secretary . 
  what happens locally should rightfully be an issue for the respective communities . 
   the romanian orthodox church , as the representative of about 90 % of the population , got the most of that money . 
  in absolute terms , yes . 
  proportionate to the population , no . 
   i fear the welfare state will die when they grow up . 
  it better , or they 're really screwed . 
  no , i do n't think it 's `` safe to assume '' . 
  i get updates from turkish friends on the receiving end of teargas and it still looks like ok reporting to me . 
  facts are bad enough , no need for drama . 
  it 's still a thing among friends or relatives , but sadly it 's not really * expected * anymore . 
  with strangers , it 's almost never done except for the obvious situations ( huge luggage , old lady , etc ) . 
  i went to ukraine ( fabulous trip ! ), 
  no colonoscopy , but you had to take a number for the queue at the embassy at 4 am because only 20 applications would be processed daily :-) i am surprised to find you still need a visa for eu travel , that 's really shitty especially that we get free pass to your country . 
  i did n't misunderstand you , that was just the historical context . 
  which network should be state owned : ( old ) phone lines , cable , fiber , wireless , mobile ? 
  there is no single network . 
  the concept of multiple owners for these networks is also fundamental to the free market and competition . 
  i also do n't buy into `` it only makes economic sense to build 1 of it '' , because that 's the opposite of what happened at both access and infrastructure level . 
  no , it does not follow . 
  you just need to enforce good regulation ( open access to providers ) and you also need competition to develop the access network ( s ) more . 
  i 'm paying ~ 20 euro for triple play : 120mbps internet , 200 mins phone calls to any network and cable tv . 
  breaking the state monopoly ( most important ) and privatising the telecom ( maybe less so , but they have really good service now , while also making profits ) were some of the best things that happened here . 
  you have no idea how quickly speeds have gone up and costs down after that . 
  hours before sentence . 
  in anticipation , as it were . 
  the same guy was accepted earlier today in hospital for ... rectal hemorrhage . 
  totally / nottheonion, 
  i for one am irked by idiotic criticism , for example that prejudice against gypsies is racism . 
  never in my lifetime ( 35 ) have i heard anyone claim that their shortcoming as members of the society ( pc enough ? ), 
  are * due * to their race , or that they 're somehow unable to do better . 
  this is a done deal since the nazis . 
  when your main talking point against my prejudice towards gypsies is gon na be that i 'm a racist , the only reponse you 'll get will be pitty for your ignorance . 
  absorb this through your liberal skulls : prejudice , yes . 
  racism , no . 
  now go make the valid points . 
  the leos certainly put a lot of hard work in there , for many long hours . 
  that 's commendable and totally worthy of respect ( and pizza ! ) . 
  the problem is with calling a ww3-ready combat force against a wounded 19yr old running on foot , ` fine work ' , 
  yes , there is an opposing view held by a minority . 
  these two articles pretty much sum it up : [ romania unravels the rule of law ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/guest-post-romania-unravels-the-rule-of-law/ ) [ separating law and politics in romania ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/guest-post-separating-law-and-politics-in-romania/ ) since last july politics here was all `` jos basescu '' and * nothing else * . 
  in december we had general elections , with pdl ( former ruling party , epp member ) basically disintegrating and the usl coalition ( socialists + liberals ) getting a huge 70 % majority in the parliament , as expected . 
  very recently we saw it toned down a bit as some agreement was seemingly reached between the president and pm on judicial issues - which pissed off both sides . 
  traian basescu lost popular support due to the austerity measures he supported and pushed for , while also being a total dick about it ( as well as most other issues ) . 
  pdl support also vanished due to gross incompetence and corruption . 
  so we 're now left with a disgustingly populist usl government whose people are remarkably inept and/or corrupt . 
  worst is they 're undoing some of the good reform prev . 
  did , under pressure from various interest groups . 
  note that the `` issue '' with the president is so polarized that one can only be a `` stinkin ' b\u0103sist '' or a `` stinkin ' commie '' , a balanced view in media or public opinion may be hard to find . 
  i 'm sorry , but no . 
  the only way you 'd get qwertz was second hand shops ( or donations , right ) , new keyboards have always been qwerty . 
  they did exist in significant numbers to get noticed , but nowhere near the number of us layouts . 
  subjective , i know , but i am old enough to have been around computers back then in a lot of places . 
  i would not hash that map . 
  official numbers in romania are 6-7 % , so applying this logic with 30 % black/gray economy we 'd have unemployment next to nothing .
