  that just is n't true for rural areas here ( source : i own a house in a village , it 's reliable  and that makes for 45 % of the population . 
  however , many live mostly by subsistence farming , so that part wo n't show up in either gdp ( unsure ? ), 
  or unemployment numbers ( definitely ) . 
  do n't jump to conclusions , i guess . 
  tl ; dr antena3 news `` mp alin popoviciu , will submit in parliament a legislative initiative in this regard . '', 
   also , germany is n't that concerned about russia . 
  also , germany is/was a bit ambivalent regarding russia , see [ schroder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#gazprom ) . 
  seriously , it 's as if you lived in a parallel universe or something . 
  those exports and those tanks and that zero debt you speak of we had too , while i was eating bread with fat and garlic , chicken claws for meat , sit in huge queues for cheese , cooking oil ( that was rationed anyway ) , potatoes , or even bread . 
  we had no heating in winter , electricity blackouts would last for hours and the only time you could properly use gas to cook was during the night . 
  that was bucharest in the '80s in case you wonder . 
  do you mind if i do n't want this working economy ? 
  i 'm fine with not being rich like i used to be .

  if you 'd just put killer asteroids on that list of scares , maybe existing telescopes could get a lil ' bit of cap funding too ? 
  you know , for food security . 
   its a matter of time until they discard the human . 
  i see it in marketing , linguistics , lots of design work , accounting , healthcare , many engineering fields , etc. 
  i see it everywhere really . 
  except we 've seen this before many times . 
  it 's normal , albeit faster technological advance that renders some acquired skills obsolete . 
  discarding the human is on a whole different level . 
  we may be there just so the us is n't first place  edit : alternately , `` second only to ( optional : poor ) romania '' . 
  if that 's the kind of tuning op meant , then yes . 
  but , at least in romania , it 's difficult to actually modify a car and keep it street legal , due to insane costs for getting your modifications approved . 
  that includes larger tires , different bumpers , rollcage/rollbars , upgraded suspension/steering , etc. 
  offroaders do it a lot , but because of that those are no longer street cars . 
  what about the bulgarian empires ? 
  are the dogs from romania yet ? 
  there are not thousands , but [ almost a million ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_spain ) romanians in spain . 
  if `` many of them '' were doing what you 're describing , you 'd surely know this . 
  orly ? 
  then why do n't we all pay equally ? 
  and i do n't mean equal percentages , but equal sums ... 
  you 're thinking so single dimensional it 's depressing :( add a time axis already , were you born yesterday ?!, 
  only then the splits & mergers , overnight team swaps , the `` sure we 'll merge after elections but for now we 'll just prop your opponent '' can really jump at you , in true to life simulations !, 
  tl ; dr the owls are not what they seem, 
   this article is biased as hell  the `` former employees of the communist secret service securitate , convicted  money launderers , fraudsters and cheaters '' in the current parliament are more or  less the same ones that were in the previous parliament . 
  pick one . 
  pay all the articles !, 
  do n't think it 's widespread in romania ... but i love albanians . 
  met few , and i liked all of them . 
  language , also national anthem . 
  little brother , maybe ? 
  * they fuel eurosceptic and xenophobic sentiments * before quotas , romanians were cautious but somewhat sympathetic to refugees . 
  that is all but gone now . 
  * the refugees themselves do n't want to be here i hope it will somehow work out with the 6500 alloted to us ( for now ) , but i doubt it very much . 
  theoretically , it could ( and it 's 1785 , btw ) . 
  in practice , we 've never had that many asylum seekers for obvious reasons . 
  our asylum centers and related infrastructure ( language classes , lawyers , specialists , etc ) are built for 1500 people only , and i 've read some time ago it 's only used at 20 % capacity . 
  the explanation given for the 1700 figure ( 85 are unhcr resettlements ) was that although it would be relatively easy to find more housing for them , integrating them into society so they can somehow manage on their own would be impossible with existing infrastructure . 
  indeed , see below for a very good exposition . 
  i thought this was a clear cut but it 's not . 
  from ecj 's pov it does , from national constitutional courts pov sometimes it does not , and there 's some room in between . 
  i 'll note that the opposite is also true ; our cc has twice struck down legislation implementing the data retention directive for example . 
  i did see this bit `` the court of justice has ruled that national constitutions should also be subject to the precedence principle . 
  it is therefore a matter for national judges not to apply the provisions of a constitution which contradict european law . '', 
  which is what i think you 're saying . 
  it appears [ not everyone agrees with this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supremacy_%28european_union_law%29 ) . 
  romanian constitution art 148 ( 2 ) says eu law takes precedence over `` internal laws '' . 
  decision 148/2003 of our ccr makes a distinction between `` internal laws '' and the constitution . 
  the more recent decision 80/2014 on a proposal for constitutional ammendment which , among other things , puts eu law above national law including the constitution , sticks to the supremacy of the constitution ( basically they say that supremacy of the constitution in our legal system can not be changed via the constitutional ammendment procedure ) . 
  ianal and i 'm probably missing a lot of the subtleties here , but that 's the impression i got ... edit : just to make it clear , it 's this bit of our constitution that 's potentially problematic : art 3 ( 4 ) `` foreign populations can not be ** moved ** [ tranfered , displaced , etc ] or colonized on the territory of the romanian state . '', 
  eu law has primacy over national laws , but not constitutions themselves . 
  yeah , our constitutional court might have an interesting case . 
  i 'm surprised we were consistent with the previously announced position . 
  our president seemed to have resigned to the idea that we 'll probably be forced to take in more than we proposed . 
  a [ previous ires poll ] ( http://www.ires.com.ro/articol/304/criza-imigran-ilor-in-europa---percep%c8%9bii-publice-ale-romanilor ) ( 28-31 august ) showed 65 % favorable to refugees being taken in by romania . 
  the question was a bit different then ( was n't about redistribution ) and that was cati not home interview , so maybe not so well calibrated . 
  i wonder if this is a shift in opinion wrt the refugees or people getting pissed at eu with its stupid quota system ... 
  let 's face what ? 
  that you have no idea what you 're talking about and just spouting stereotypes ? 
  [ bucharest vs vienna ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_cities.jsp?country1=romania&amp;country2=austria&amp;city1=bucharest&amp;city2=vienna ) . 
  get your head out of your ass . 
  there was [ a similar article ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/justice-home-affairs/romania-accept-refugees-if-admitted-schengen-317426 ) ( with a bulgarian author ) posted here in the previous days . 
  no , this is n't romania 's position at all currently . 
  nobody here has raised this conditionality for accepting the immigrants . 
  read the `` ponta '' segment of this article carefully . 
  something funny is going on , 
  yeah  at least , that 's what our [ minister of the economy says ] ( http://www.economica.net/mihai-tudose-economie-firma-care-trebuia-sa-construiasca-gazoductul-giurgiu-ruse-a-pierdut-freza-de-foraj-sub-dunare_106233.html ) . 
  it 's not necessarily true ( heh ) , but it looks like the ( romanian ) contractor has had `` issues '' . 
  they 're bidding the contract again next month and expect the works to take no less than 14 months . 
   i 'm pretty sure it 's part of the convention well , it 's not . 
  they can continue on , sure , but with proper documentation . 
  transit states are required to assist with said documentation . 
  it 's only not illegal if crossing a border directly from the territory where they are threatened ( art . 
  31 of the convention ) . 
  not the case here . 
  they still have the right to seek asylum as refugees , but they have no immunitiy for illegally crossing other borders . 
  it 's not the last eu state holding out . 
  our president said romania 's mandate at the jha meeting on the 14th is against mandatory quotas . 
  left dude 's fly is open . 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ going ^ ^ to ^ ^ hell ^ ^ anyway, 
  [ bejenie ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/bejenie ) ^ ^ not ^ ^ slavic ^ ^ i ^ ^ swear, 
  if they send them towards romania they 'll still end up at your border in no time . 
  the few illegals that were caught trying to come here were pushed back to serbia and they took them , as per billateral agreements . 
  they 're obviously not any more interested to be registered here than in hungary , i assume they went back and just try again at your border directly . 
   people like that exist only in movies seeing as you 've got this one right , i wonder why you do n't get to the logical conclusion  he 's no hero , do n't kid yourself . 
  they say the contract was signed in 2007 , isis did n't even exist then , do n't think the plan involved them . 
  maybe its capabilities are still useful against an intervention force ( bvr missiles ) , or he just could not renegotiate the deal .
