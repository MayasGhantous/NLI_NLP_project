  this armchair airforce general really has no idea . 
  international traffic via hegyeshalom and sturovo is suspended , [ according to our rail operator ] ( http://www.cfrcalatori.ro/presa/trenurile-interna%c8%9bionale-suspendate-temporar-de-la--budapesta-c%c4%83tre-austria/europa-de-vest-56/s-1/p-2 ) . 
  bucharest-vienna only goes to budapest and passengers can continue to the border with hungarian trains only ( i assume this means there still are trains departing from there ) . 
  we have some [ polling results ] ( http://www.ires.com.ro/articol/304/criza-imigran-ilor-in-europa---percep%c8%9bii-publice-ale-romanilor ) . 
  we would agree that romania host `` a certain number of immigrants '' ( 65 % ) , with 46 % ok if part of them is settled in their town ( not surprising , 42 % definitely not ) . 
  65 % would volunteer to help the migrants ( haha ) . 
  79 % think european states should all share the burden . 
  people are concerned about security , for example 72 % think the risk of a terror attack will be higher . 
  people have no trust in the central ( 75 % ) and local ( 67 % ) government to handle the crisis , but more in the power structures of the state . 
  overall , romania is not prepared for this , but relatively few people think it will become a major problem for us . 
  romania offered to handle 1800 migrants for the next 2 years ( of which 80 are refugee resettlement through unhcr ) . 
  we have 6 asylum centers with 1500 places of which 20 % are occupied . 
  we afford them 0.68 euro/day for food , 0.41 euro for accomodation and a whopping 0.14 euro for other expenses . 
  afaik the only tangible thing they did so far was to reinforce border patrols on our border with serbia , along with holding a good number of crisis meetings . 
  i pity the poor souls should it happen they 're forced to seek refuge over here . 
  edit : oh yeah , in the last days church leaders came out with statements like `` as christians , we should lend a hand to those in need , regardless of their beliefs , yada yada '' . 
  for romania , not insignificant . 
  ` edge of space ' tourist flights ? 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af i was merely pointing out those jets could be syrian , not russian . 
  http://www.janes.com/article/53660/syria-reportedly-receives-mig-31-interceptors-from-russia also assad has mig-29s , which look identical to su-27 in a 5x5 pixels image . 
  how can you not see the problem with this ? 
  hungary either processes the migrants or it does n't . 
  if it does n't , how can they tell which of them are syrians ? 
  if it does , good luck with the angry mob that ca n't get to germany . 
  looked like [ this one ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/bosch_com_607-135.php ) , including the led which blinked when you had coverage . 
  could it simply be due to the backlog of applications ? 
  i mean , counting the application in that time interval towards the total , with the decision not being available yet . 
  as you can see , it 's got nothing to do with granting/not granting asylum as refugee , but rather with paying/not paying a fine for illegally crossing the border . 
  the actual situation would be identical , if not for dublin regulations . 
  there 's an actual interview , not a questionnaire . 
  i could probably do it without any training , but it 's held by professionals . 
  it 's those two ' 17s to the left that would seal bulgaria 's fate . 
  you have 20-30 airworthy planes ? 
  ^ ^ turns ^ ^ red ^ ^ with ^ ^ envy we ca n't even do air police alone anymore , nato are supplementing our air force to 2017 when the ex-portuguese ex-usaf f16 squadron becomes operational . 
  to say nothing about the fact rt is not in russian . 
  the romanian connection in this particular case might just have been a jab at us by janos lazar ( orban 's chief of cabinet , or whatever it 's called ) who originated it . 
  hurts me a bit to sound like a nationalistic clown , but google the guy , its not the first time . 
  that 's for refugees directly entering the country from a territory where they 're threatened ( article 31 ) . 
  so unless they 're somehow illegally flying/sailing to finland , does n't apply . 
  but this is just protection from punishment for illegally entering the country , and has nothing to do with their status as refugees . 
  they are still refugees even on the other side of the planet , and the terms of the convention apply . 
  in theory , not a citizen of any state , although i suspect in practice it also includes what you said . 
  but there are people that never get the citizenship of the country they 're born/live in , for example [ some gypsies ] ( http://www.refworld.org/docid/4a7023c72.html ) . 
  i have not noticed that , and you 're just a google search away . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_migrant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee it 's only the latter that create legal obligations under the [ geneva convention for refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) . 
  the `` surprise '' is probably the fact you 're mostly handling economic migrants , not refugees fleeing from war , etc. 
  romania , which is n't a first entry country , has about the same number of syrian asylants as italy ( 2000 and something iirc , since the war started ) . 
  bulgaria a few times more . 
  your asylum applicants are coming from [ nigeria , mali , gambia , pakistan , senegal , etc ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png/531px-five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png ) . 
  everything 's not all peachy in those countries , but they 're not syria/irak levels . 
  this is not to say italy is n't swamped with the number of immigrants that it needs to handle . 
  everybody can see that . 
   do you really think that if russia were to invade eastern europe tomorow , countries like germany , the uk or france who have centuries of experience in warfare are not going to realize that refusing to fight is endangering their own defensive position ? 
  yes . 
  because they think russia would never touch * them * ( which is probably true for the foreseeable future ) . 
  so why ca n't germany do that and keep its mouth shut about it ? 
  it 's not that hard to realize such a statement will antagonize those parts of europe that want more control over immigration :( are there that many countries that are denying syrians asylum , or blindly applying dublin iii ? 
  in romania it 's `` the day of commemoration of the victims of fascism and communism '' . 
  in addition , dec 21 is the `` day of remembrance for the victims of communism in romania '' . 
  also on this day , in 1939 , the ribbentrop-molotov pact was signed . 
  it rained . 
  [ harmless ] ( http://www.cugetliber.ro/imagini/mari/31ianuarieconvoioprit-1391187122.jpg ) [ passport ] ( http://image.stirileprotv.ro/media/images/600x375/jan2011/60469424.jpg ) [ checks ] ( http://transporter.ro//phpthumb/phpthumb.php?src=/userfiles/13868/coloana-tiruri-frontiera-bulgaria-turcia.jpg&amp;w=700&amp;h=500&amp;far=c ), 
  legal refugee status , per the un convention for refugees , is only one form of protection . 
  romania , and i suspect other countries as well , has additional provisions for special situations which grant similar protection . 
  iae , only 10 % of the applicants entered the country illegally ( which , assuming they did n't register as refugees in turkey , entitles them to refugee status ) . 
  the rest are here one legal way or another . 
  to become illegal immigrants they have to overstay after their asylum request was denied . 
  [ 1.8 million ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php ) of them did that . 
  only 6 % of the 4m syrian refugees sought asylum in europe ( from the same page ) . 
  it sort of did exist . 
  romania 's national bank treasury ( which included 3t of polish gold ) was in fact hidden in a cave at the end of ww2 , to prevent both the soviets ( that had already `` lost '' the treasure sent there during ww1 ) and the germans from taking it . 
  it stayed hidden until 1947 . 
  no , they are n't . 
  bulgaria had 11k asylum applicants last year . 
  they built a huge fence on the border with turkey because of illegals . 
  in romania we had 700 asylum applicants in the first 5 months this year . 
  what irks me is that while i 'm absolutely certain many immigrants to europe are economic migrants , some ( syrians , etc ) are bona fide refugees and do n't deserve this kind of crap . 
   literally nobody ( exactly 0 people ) applied in romania so far , for example . 
  ahem ... [ 700 asylum applicants jan-may 2015 , mostly syrians ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/social/aproximativ-700-de-cereri-de-azil-in-romania-au-fost-depuse-in-2015-cele-multe-de-cetateni-sirieni-14478222 ) . 
  you 'd never buy it for onroad , that 's silly . 
  offroad it 's an extremely decent car for the price , its problem is it is rather unreliable and parts are ( at least were , some 10 years ago ) of abysmal quality . 
  any 20 + year old japanese or american car offroad is infinitely better in that aspect , even if you have to put some money into them ( lift kits , lockers , suspension , tires , etc ) to get better abilities than what a stock niva already has . 
  it does n't happen every day because usually they give up if chased off , indeed . 
  but the scale of the attack is not at all unusual , [ look it up ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=lupi+la+stana ) . 
  shepherds are supposed to chase them off because if they get inside the animal shed , this is exactly what happens . 
  and since they ca n't legally shoot them and ca n't keep too many dogs around , it 's as easy and safe as it sounds . 
  they kill a lot more than what they need to eat , for some reason . 
  a pack of wolves will easily kill tens/hundreds of sheep in a single attack . 
  edit : i mean , nobody would care if it were just one/two animals killed , the problem is they do [ this ] ( http://www.emaramures.ro/stiri/40783/actualizare-atac-masacru-stana-57-de-oi-sfasiate-de-lupi-38-ranite-si-27-disparute-la-rona-de-sus ) ( mildly nsfw ) . 
  in the wikipedia page there is a picture of romanian sarma cooked in pumpkin . 
  do you really do it that way ? 
  typically , no . 
  on occasion , yes . 
  and i think the wikipedia pic is someone 's first attempt at it  it 's cut on the wrong side - you use it vertically with the head as cover , and much of the pulp needs to be scooped unless you want a pumpkin dish , not sarmale . 
  thank you based turkey :-) no really , it 's just that the name sounds more greek than turkish to me , not sure which way we imported it . 
  we have a lot of turkish foods that we call `` national '' . 
  ottomans sure could cook ,

  i would like to point out nowhere in the article is russia mentioned ( that 's ops editorializing ) , and the attacks are `` virusing attempts '' , whatever that means , creatively counted by our intellgence service .
