  i 'm sure if i look at my firewall logs i can draw the conclusion that `` russia '' is at cyberwar with my home upc connection as well . 
  it 's just a silly pr piece from sri after a version of the tinba trojan was found to [ target 12 romanian banks exclusively ] ( https://securityintelligence.com/tinba-trojan-sets-its-sights-on-romania/ ) , which made some headline news . 
  i beg you , [ lord daewoo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ppbobyd.jpg ) , do n't fail me now !, 
  it 's 34c on my north-facing balcony ( could be worse tbh , i 've seen 38 a few weeks ago ) . 
  i am not sure how a collider in romania allows bigger cooperation with * russian * scientists , but iae they 're building this : http://www.eli-np.ro,

  you could make this argument about belarus maybe , kazakhstan is a petro-state . 
  belarus ' economy , at least from afar , looks in better shape than russia 's , even . 
   btw after 2007 , i heard so many stories about romanians fascinated by our cuisine i 'm one of those  the reason was in any restaurant i stopped the food was great and the menu very diverse , whereas the image of a romanian restaurant i had back then was that they were serving lazy cook foods only - grilled this and that , chips and two kinds of soup . 
  did i mention it was also * incredibly * cheap ? 
  now , both of these things changed a lot in recent years , but your restaurants are still very good . 
  bulgaria , what 's up ? 
  you have good wines but do n't drink them ? 
  [ yes , i am sure . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=bancuri+cu+scotieni ), 
  i do n't know about hungary , but in romania the scotsman is the goto cheapskate person in jokes . 
  i also do n't know where it comes from . 
   i mean you would n't actually call feta , mozzarella , ricotta or other types of cheese br\u00e2nz\u0103 , right ? 
  wrong , 
  that would be romanian * r\u00e2nz\u0103 * , as well . 
  i can maybe give one example : romanian government dragged its feet for more than 10 years and is still unable to say a final yes or no to the project . 
  as much as i 'm against it , this is completely unreasonable . 
  problem is `` bringing in that ** particular ** investment '' and `` changing the law ** for you ** '' happens to be rather unconstitutional . 
  equality under law and all that . 
  add to this that any hint of personal interest of the guy ( s ) in charge puts them straight in jail . 
  a competent government would have been able to do what you say no doubt , but ours was all `` rule of law is hard , let 's go shopping '' , and failed . 
  fortunately . 
   the first one - yes it 's not that long of an exposure , probably less than 30 seconds . 
  to see the andromeda galaxy ( bottom center ) naked eye you need much better skies than this though , without those orange city lights . 
  according to wikipedia , `` the last existing leper colony in europe is [ tichile\u0219ti ] ( http://spitalultichilesti.ro/ ) in romania . '', 
  basically they added miscarea legionara explicitly to the list of bad stuff . 
  ow man , your signs are so much better than what he had . 
  huh ? 
  nowhere does it say ` budget deficit ' . 
  you are right he 's messing that up a bit ( plus no investment , no education/research , etc ) but that 's not the topic here . 
  i 'm more curious about bulgaria , actually . 
  their currency is already pegged to the euro . 
   these people are just mindless nationalists , they have zero understanding of economics , international politics etc. 
  they do n't understand what the consequences of such a union would be . 
  well , it 's a good thing 80 % of the population has you to explain these things ... 
  both , but mostly prices went down . 
  8.2 % decrease instead of the nominal 12 % . 
  low or irrelevant skills for the job , yes . 
  think `` we need a c guy to work on the linux kernel '' and getting `` i have 2 years of php + mysql experience '' . 
  i can only give you my subjective experience from small companies . 
  if 10-12 years ago i had to build a db just to keep track and rate the resumes we received and only call some 10 % of them for an actual interview , and those would be almost always hirable , now it can be a month until i just get a resume that 's not depressing . 
   i do n't think you can count romania as part of the balkans . 
  see ? 
  what 's not to like about serbs ? 
  there were 9037 muslims in bucharest at the [ last census ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/comunitatea_musulman%c4%83_din_bucure%c8%99ti ) . 
  `` biggest mosque in christian europe '' is not for them ... 
  you are using old data . 
  56.8 % moldovans , 23.1 % romanian , 7.6 % ukrainian , etc. 
  you are not wrong , first time i heard albanians speaking i was like whoa , they speak backwards romanian . 
  there is no mutual intelligibility , though . 
  that 's not entirely correct as there are also preventive measures if you 're obstructing the investigation , destroying evidence , planning to flee , etc. 
  that 's decided by a ` rights and liberties ' judge and can include arrest up to 30 days and it has nothing to do legally with the actual charges . 
  this is what 's spun to `` arresting people without a sentence '' by the usual suspects ... 
  ah , i misunderstood the part about being able to fire both then . 
  sure , eventually we 'll have to do that , but i expect stockpiles and manufacturing are the greater concerns . 
  the new development above is in nato 5.56 . 
  those are variants ( m762 , m545 ) it 's not like you can just swap your cartridge with one of a different caliber bullet . 
  you can probably swap a lot of parts , but in terms of logistics i would think it 's the ammo that counts , no ? 
  `` second to none '' of your 2nd dragoons was pretty good too . 
  it was visibile as far south as romania ( 46.7 n ) with long exposures .

  bulgaria , this is not the anti-corruption agency you want  [ bulgarian journalists miss interview with ani head ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ndtlwcfgb8 ), 
  ... any more . 
  if they never come to port in the black sea , they do elsewhere . 
  and to go elsewhere , you need to pass the bosphorus , dardanelles and gibraltar undetected . 
  minimum depth in the bosphorus is ~ 30m . 
  not impossible , but completely ridiculous in peace time . 
  no , but it 's [ not that hard to guess ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sktkygc.jpg ) . 
   there are submarines with nuclear weapons in the black sea the black sea fleet has 3 kilo/improved kilo class submarines that do n't carry nuclear weapons . 
  [ he is not a mep any more ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html?country=ro ) . 
  this time around we did n't send clear medical cases to the ep . 
  what 's your reference ? 
  if you compare with the basescu period , the whole `` dictatorship '' , `` political police '' , `` prosecutors republic '' , etc lunacy is essentially dead . 
  the most you get these days is some feeble `` let 's all be reasonable with these prosecutions , now '' . 
  it 's only the accused , like udrea , that sometimes still go full retard , but it 's not getting any traction ( see trust in dna in polls ) . 
   i knew it meant something like that but did n't know the `` origins '' of the word . 
  its origins are [ unknown ] ( http://adatbank.transindex.ro/html/alcim_pdf457.pdf ) , actually . 
  the `` without a home '' explanation is just one of them , and often you 'll be told `` that 's what it actually means in hungarian '' . 
  in any event , it does n't mean anything in romanian . 
  alternate etymologies : `` bez gorod '' ( slavic ) , `` bashkir '' , misheard `` bazd meg '' or other onomatopoeic . 
  but these days we know it 's an insult , you know it 's an insult , so it works as an insult , 
  it 's not the negru-voda one , it 's a new one close to silistra . 
   some roads just are n't used often enough to justify bigger investments . 
  i anticipate this crossing to have a traffic of * at least * 10 cars a year / s. 
  it 's smack in the middle of nowhere , both in . bg and . ro ( even more so ) , and the regular crossing between the city of silistra ( bg ) and the danube ferry to calarasi ( ro ) is ~ 30km away . 
  but i think you 're reading too much into it , the romanian side only has < 1km 4 lane there , then it reverts to 2 lane and connects to the main national road ( dn3 ) which is also 2 lane . 
  it 's super low traffic , being used mostly by locals and the few tourists that want to take the scenic route to the seaside as opposed to the motorway further north . 
  it 's just an amusing pic , that 's all . 
   somewhat of a political support that largely came in the aftermath of his election , though . 
  remember that among the very first things he did ( if not the first ) was that immunity vote stunt , which set the public 's expectations at a certain level as all eyes were on him . 
  noticed how no politician raises his voice against judges or the dna anymore ? 
  i 'd say iohannis did help a bit , even if the other factors you mentioned are far more important indeed . 
  meteoroid .
