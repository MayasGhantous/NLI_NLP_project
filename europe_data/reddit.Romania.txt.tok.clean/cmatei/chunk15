  [ targovishte , bulgaria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/targovishte ) ^ ( they 're pronounced the same , even ), 
  mini-vacations . 
  may 1st is when a lot of bucharesters go to the seaside for a summer season preview for example , or at the very least out of town for a picnic . 
  as it 's also easter , a lot are likely visiting countryside relatives indeed , if they have any . 
  on easter/may 1st/christmas/new year 's bucharest is almost completely shut down for one or two days . 
  looking at how the second largest party barely managed to nominate a bucharest mayor candidate , just 6 days before the deadline ... not that many . 
  and yes , they had to give up on one of their previous three choices because he was charged with soliciting dirty/illegal campaign money . 
  i 've also heard about romania blackmailing the eu for schengen membership before : * serbia getting candidate status * croatia getting membership status * ratifying the appointment of meps * accepting the refugee deal * ... you 'd think if that was the case , it would be obvious even to our government that blackmail does n't work , no ? 
  oh , it 's georgi gotev again , getting his stories from `` government official who asked not to be named '' . 
  you can safely ignore anything he writes about romania . 
  romania wo n't veto anything over the visa thing , or even threaten to veto . 
  i did n't check , but i 'm willing to bet this is the only source for the claim . 
  romania 's policies have been pro-cyclical since 1990 , nothing new here . 
  / joke , but not really, 
   used to be good at rugby triggered, 
   anti-hungarian sentiment lies in the areas where there is no hungarian minority ( especially southern romania ) [ enough with this arrogant bullshit already ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ovgmv1f.png ), 
   still more hated than the russians ... less liked , actually . 
  if you look at the red bar ( hatred ) we 're just after the russians ( 47 vs 50 % ) , if that 's any consolation :-), 
  it 's not important who manages their social media accounts . 
  what 's important is that regular media picks up these trolling attempts , which in turn brings more exposure to the subject and the politicians involved . 
  it 's a rather productive use of time i would say . 
   unfamiliar ( like , hmm , most of foreign media , politicians and public ) that 's just nonsense . 
  you can be sure most of the non-polish media , politicians and ... well some of the public would have known sikorski very well after the ukrainan maidan . 
  the tape scandal and subsequent resignation was a pretty big story too . 
  i certainly made the connection immediately , and i know virtually nothing about polish politics . 
  these images come from 9x24cm glass negatives , they 're huge . 
  people often have this question , how come such old photos look so good , but almost always they 're taken on big negatives that require much smaller enlargement for printing than yesterday 's 24x36mm film or current digital . 
  bad lenses and bad photographic emulsions had a much smaller impact this way . 
  those are 2 people , among the 100 + mayors sent to trial by the anti-corruption agency in 2015 alone . 
  add half the county council chiefs . 
  add 4 out of 6 bucharest local ( sector ) mayors , plus the mayor general . 
  literally a drop in the ocean ... 
   and , as this articles says , they are more homophobic than they should be . 
  oh , the article says . 
  it must be so , then . 
  i think you need something a bit more substantial than a rubber dinghy for any of those routes ( 200 + km ) . 
  edit : also , romania-moldova/ukraine is hard to cross undetected unless our gov decides to allow it . 
  also a sister ship of our navy 's [ mircea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mircea_%28ship%29 ) . 
   i mean , razboj today means loom in serbian and croatian it has that alternate meaning in romanian as well : [ r\u0103zboi de \u021besut ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c4%83zboi_de_%c8%9besut ) . 
  not really a joke , just something i picked up at home that nearly got me in trouble in school . 
  dear leader 's [ speaches ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sboeyseguae ) on tv where entertaining enough with his hand gestures and pidgin romanian , but on occasion we did [ something different ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv1citt1fn0 ) with his portrait ( there was one on the opening page of most books ) . 
  how the fuck is he a scapegoat if he 's not innocent ? 
  tell that to his victims ' families with a straight face !, 
   but you ca n't seriously be proposing that hate speech is not an issue in romania . 
  actually , you can . 
  does it happen ? 
  yes . 
  does it matter ? 
  let me know what political force has a hatred fueled discourse and is not quickly marginalized . 
  i was afraid ponta 's presidential campaign might change that , but you saw how spectacularly it backfired . 
  so tell me ... as long as society reacts negatively to hate speech , both on the left and on the right ( and i 'm not talking about the nominal left/right parties here ) , what is the problem that needs to be fixed with a badly formulated law ? 
  [ not yet ] ( http://www.amuritiliescu.ro/ ) . 
  leader of mustache socialist 's party [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liviu_dragnea ) is n't doing too well at the moment . 
  so the countless idiots babbling about how they 're smarter than everybody else because they do n't vote will finally shut the fuck up . 
  ^ ( other than this , do n't think it 's a good idea ), 
   we have similar principles in bulgaria , but what happens is :   the major of the village collects the id cards and writes the ballots himself  the protocol at the end with the counted votes is forged  people just travel around a region with buses paid by the parties and vote multiple times this used to be much more common here as well . 
  then two things happened : 1 . both high and low profile prosecutions for election rigging which made most people less willing to risk their necks 2 . lots and lots of volunteer observers from ngos . 
  see point 1 . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  sounds more reasonable . 
  in our case we need 50 % turnout for a referendum to be validated , but it 's not binding . 
  what happens after is a bit of a mistery . 
  the constitutional court sees the referendum as `` the will of the people '' and has twice ( iirc ) stricken down changes to the electoral law as non-compliant , but the parliament is n't otherwise forced to implement it in any given time frame . 
  is this referendum binding according to the bulgarian consitution ? 
  because if it is n't ( consultative only ) , your politicians will take a hint from ours . 
  we voted for 300mps instead of 470 , and got 588 instead ... iae , this is nice !, 
  also on the plus side , if you ever run into debt problems , you 'll be one of the biigs . 
  and if we also join , it will be even biigr . 
  i found this hard to grasp the first time i heard someone say it . 
  did n't get any easier . 
  sorry , man ... just so you know , you can also see andromeda naked eye , or the magellanic clouds if you 're ever in the southern hemisphere . 
  ahm , as in visegrad , now i see your connection . 
  not as such , unless all `` upper xyz '' type names count , those we have a few . 
  we used to have [ cetatea alba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bilhorod-dnistrovskyi ) ^ before ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ stole ^ ^ ^ ^ it . 
  it has a namesake in transylvania ( white citadel ) in the town of alba-iulia . 
  please do n't get any ideas , 
  [ it would have to go a lot farther ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) . 
  check out [ our spy station ] ( http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page8.html ) . 
   but if you declare a pub to be a private club ( with membership , etc ) , i bet you can have smoking inside . 
  no , you ca n't , that 's one of the things i do n't like about this law . 
  they tried to close the existing loopholes which allowed pubs to be de-facto all smoking ( i could agree with this !, 
  ) , but went full retard instead . 
  i do n't think you understand the definition of `` regardless of access rights '' . 
  `` public space - any space accessible to the public or designed for collective usage , regardles of the ownership or access rights '' it was not meant to ban smoking in your home , sure . 
  but it is vague enough that you can interpret it that way , that 's what i was saying . 
  imho it should have been more specific , i do n't like the way it casually shits on your property rights - not assuming malice , just wish it were more carefully thought out . 
  the devil is in the details , which are a bit vague . 
  you can go with the interpretation as far as banning smoking in your home if you invite some friends over . 
  smoking/tobacco clubs are clearly banned ( e.g. 
  the narghile/hookah specialty bars we had ) . 
  that said , as a smoker i really do n't mind smoking outside and would prefer clean air inside . 
  it 's not that much a question of having the money , it 's whether such projects make sense or not . 
  bucharest can expand horizontally for much cheaper if needed . 
  in contrast , look at istanbul , they have a hundred skyscrapers or so , they are forced to do it due to its size and their economy is not that great either . 
  i though this could be an interesting conversation , but looks like you 'd rather grind your axe . 
  bucharest has no architectural values ? 
  lol . 
  we have a few at 100m + already , but as high rises in bucharest are rather expensive because of the bad soil and [ seismicity ] ( http://www.preventionweb.net/files/10049_10049escsesamepostera41.jpg ) , i doubt we 'll get as many as warsaw any time soon . 
  that 's berlin .
