  and here 's the [ great circle path ] ( http://www.gcmap.com/map?p=fra-hnd&amp;ms=wls&amp;mx=540x540&amp;pm=* ) , does n't get near bucharest . 
  the blinkenlights is tegel airport i think . 
  snow is not really bad as it provides extra protection in case temperatures drop a lot ( that is bad ) . 
  it will likely end with some prosecutions , indeed . 
  70 eur for a chrystantemum lol . 
  we badly need this money for our budget , so for example bucharest can spend [ 600m eur over 7 years ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/bucharest-has-less-green-areas-but-spends-more-money-for-them/162697/ ) for `` flowers '' , `` garbage bins '' and `` swing seats '' , 
  [ precision vs accuracy ] ( http://kaffee.50webs.com/science/images/accuracy-vs-precision1.jpg ) edit : changed the image , the first one was wrong . 
  that said , this map is neither precise nor accurate ( or i do n't get the joke ) . 
  imho yalta is a tourist trap , but the rest of crimea is just amazing . 
  no , we use a [ revised julian calendar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revised_julian_calendar ) which is in sync with gregorian for the next 800 years or so ( romania , bulgaria , greece among others ) which is why christmas is on the 25th . 
  edit : til , finland does indeed use gregorian . 
   this is why we cant purely have lots of little generators such as wind turbines . 
  they all need a 50hz signal to follow , and that signal needs to come from something big and constant such as a coal/gas/nuclear . 
  in case of wind turbines ( more obviously , solar ) this is done with invertors . 
  it 's almost trivial to achieve synchronicity with the grid , unlike those `` big and constant '' things . 
  i almost starred in [ this movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh6_gzy1w7k ) . 
  children in [ my school class ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/organiza%c8%9bia_pionierilor ) were taken to the hall and did weeks of rehearsals on how and when to applaud . 
  my parents were against this though so they called me in sick on the days of the congress , 
  that 's one assumption , but [ dimitrie cantemir ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/descriptio_moldaviae ) tells us latin alphabet was used prior , before nationalism existed or the 19th century re-latinization ( which btw happened in all romance languages , usually earlier ) . 
  he 's talking about moldova not walachia , but that was also part of the bulgarian empires . 
  there are also late ( r ) 16th century romanian texts ( translations ) in latin alphabet , albeit with hungarian/italian orthography rules . 
  that unfriendliness goes farther back to gheorghiu-dej in the early 50s , even though he was stalin 's choice . 
   not only did they abandon their 1000 year old history of using cyrillic , there are no surviving texts older than 16th century , but my understanding is they used latin before the council of florence and adopted cyrillic then because muh orthodoxy . 
   same ~ ~ longitude ~ ~ latitude as cairo longitude-wise , you 're in the other hemisphere . 
  i know you know , it 's just my inner cartographer speaking . 
  it can be , but it 's not . 
  starting from 1997 we have negative urbanisation rate , contrary to expectation . 
   https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/703/22046575373_60fe3ff78a_h.jpg this looks pretty cool . 
  not sure the people liviing in those commie blocks enjoy it just as much , but damn ... was it policy in poland as well to hide churches behind aparment buildings ? 
  there are not many , in fact it 's just a handful : brunei , qatar , ksa , uae , bahrain , kuwait . 
  i 'm looking at hdi . 
  none of those is particularly welcoming to refugees . 
  actual meals : soup + main course + desert + drink = 20 ron at calif for example , which is excellent . 
  lunch menu at caru cu bere is 22.40 ron ( limited options , but you get to see the place which is in your guide ) . 
  at 25 ron you have plenty of choices for a full meal , delivered at your place . 
  if you cook yourself you save a lot , not sure why you regard this as a bad thing , in the context of being cheap . 
  it may not be your idea of holiday/travel , but for many people this is ok . 
  how so ? 
  66p transportation = 3 bus fares . 
  # 7.11 meals = 44.27 ron , more than enough for a day . 
  # 1.97 drinks = ~ 3-4 beers . 
  i do n't know if you can find a bunk in a hostel for # 2.59 , quite possibly . 
  107 ron average for a day sounds doable to me ( times 30 days it 's more than the average monthly income , mind you ) . 
  keep in mind this is a backpacker 's budget , it 's not like you ca n't spend 200 + eur/day for a hotel room . 
  ... [ for a few generations in the family ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsmtpklao5s7j4egggvs8sseopnk7p4ejqvevlabbebzkdq3po3 ) . 
  according to dictionaries it is used positively as well , but i 've never heard it used other than sarcastically : `` you 're trying to make a whip out of shit and expect it to snap , too ? '', 
  turkey made it pretty clear what their roe on the syrian border were , after one of their jets was shut down by syria : shoot , questions later . 
  the syrian mig-23 they [ shut down in march ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2015/05/08/turkish-f-16-sports-mig-23-kill-markings/ ) made an even smaller incursion than the russian jets . 
  yup , and this is also why you never keep food in your tent overnight . 
  if a bear wants it , you 're in the way . 
  brown bears are fortunately not as aggressive as the american ones , but they 're still predators . 
  lol . 
  turkey did n't try , turkey succeeded . 
  russia tried . 
  you can make them with ppp though . 
  the cedilla versions were considered ok for romanian because our standards body is shaite and failed to raise the issue . 
  while s cedilla is used by turkish , t cedilla is only used by gagauz afaik ( a much smaller number of speakers than romanian ) . 
  the comma below code points for proper romanian letters were only introduced in unicode 3.0 . 
  because of this , s/t cedilla usage became unfortunatelly widespread ( windows xp , most fonts ) and it 's still a bitch to correct . 
  nominated . 
  he still needs to be validated by the parliament . 
  i think it will likely happen , no objections were raised by the majority party ( psd ) , but a surprise is possible . 
  pet peeve : some of the romanian letters on the map are incorrect . 
  we do n't use \u015f and \u0163 ( s/t-cedilla ) , but rather \u0219 and \u021b ( s/t with comma below ) . 
  both are elected in a mixed-member proportional scheme and have the same mandate terms . 
  the `` difference '' in responsability is only which chamber gets to see a type of law first . 
  it does n't matter if it is passed or not , because if only for a few exceptions , it 's not the deciding chamber . 
  this has lead to a common practice of `` tacit approval '' where laws are not even examined by the first chamber . 
  now , there was a referendum called in 2009 by the ~ ~ then-just-suspended ~ ~ soon-to-be-reelected president for dubious reasons , which , although consultative , decided there will be no more than 300 mps ( this is sparta ! ), 
  and the parliament be single-chamber . 
  this was not implemented , and the number of mps grew from 471 to 566 . 
  it 's far from being the `` main thing '' demanded in the square , and although i would prefer a single-chamber parliament instead of what we have now ( this is not really a popular opinion , afaict ) , the reason it is being brought up now is more like `` you fuckers , do what we asked for '' . 
  edit : mixed up with the 2007 impeachment , the 2009 referendum was at elections time , 
  it 's just a ( not very well thought out imho ) attempt at calming people down a bit . 
  in our constitution , the president is supposed to mediate between state powers and also between state and society . 
  he 's taking the latter quite literally . 
  there 's all sorts of crazy proposals from the public , of course , like well known singers or tv hosts for pm , etc. 
  there are others which are very sensible . 
  iae , this is a first . 
  realitatea edited their clickbait title , check it again . 
  but seriously , does n't it look to you out of proportion for another country to do that ? 
  ah , got it , thanks . 
  yeah , that 's right and a good point , i said distortion but it 's just perspective that 's important . 
  it 's not the same effect . 
  cropping will not affect the size of objects relative to each other . 
  that 's perspective , and you can change it by changing your distance to the subject ( s ) . 
  [ example ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t4pw2l6axx4/uwe18zewkhi/aaaaaaaacdm/pmqlkq7qofq/s1600/zoom-vs-crop-pin.jpg ) from [ this article ] ( http://www.boostyourphotography.com/2013/09/zooming-vs-cropping.html ) . 
  that 's what makes this kind of pictures so striking and simulates the ` moon illusion ' , even if a small angular fov lens does , indeed , magnify . 
  the illusion refers to naked eye viewing , though . 
  these photos were obtained with a telephoto lens , which introduces some perspective distortion . 
  and by 2200 , you 'll probably have negative population . 
  i expect this to be a temporary thing . 
  no doubt access infrastructure costs more ( gpon for example is in comparison dirt cheap ) , and they can afford less investment in backbone capacity . 
  once access is solved they 'll catch up with the rest and data caps will be history . 
   data caps what are these ` data caps ' you speak of ? 
  :p there is no fixed broadband isp here that uses this model , only the mobile operators think they 're exepmt from coming out of the middle ages . 
  there used to be an ` acceptable use ' cap for home users where you 'd get throttled if you exceeded a rather generous monthly allowance , but even that is gone . 
  business deals never had any cap . 
  you mean crash , bounce , crash , bounce , crash , rest on the side , in the shadow , on a comet ? 
  this .
