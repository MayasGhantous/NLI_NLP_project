  there 's only a handful of professional astronomers left in romania . 
  to work in this field you 're pretty much forced to emigrate , because unlike bulgaria there are no facilities : largest telescopes of the astronomical institute are 50cm , some placed in really bad locations like in bucharest . 
  that 's worse than amateur level . 
  hah , that 's where our pirate party actually did something ( they 're a loose bunch , not much activity otherwise ) . 
  they tried to register without the required 25000 signatures so they could challenge the rule at the constitutional court as contrary to the freedom of association . 
  somehow they won ( cc changed opinion from previous rulings ) and now you only need 3 founding members to form a party . 
   noone thought about it apparently ... 
  apparently german redditors really do n't get it . 
  we 're discussing refugee quotas since at least may 2015 . 
  opposition to the idea was really well known . 
  it is beyond naive to say `` nobody thought about it '' . 
  even accepting this is a possibility , it 's fucking worse than if it were thought through ... 
  same here , and our former president was a contrarian like that . 
  makes for a spectacular debate , not so much for good governance . 
   saying turkey is a significantly worse place than bulgaria is just bullshit . 
  it may not be obvious now , but give it 10 years and it will be . 
  all of the eu ( except the opt-outs ) is supposed to join schengen . 
  there is frontex here because our borders are to be schengen borders realsoonnow ( tm ) . 
  frontex is very much related to schengen , specifically the protection of its outside borders . 
  i did , until the warm color cfls became available , i could n't stand the blue-ish ones . 
  but `` going out of my way '' simply meant that when i found a store which had 100w bulbs , i 'd buy more than needed . 
  i still have a few in the stash ...

  he is not kidding , just extrapolating from romania to the whole eastern europe . 
  it so happens that history education was used as a propaganda tool for ceausescu 's nationalist ideology and fightin ' dem ottomans was a big part of that narrative . 
  [ romanian protochronism ] ( http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1525/california/9780520072169.003.0006 ) . 
  this has definitely left a mark , for example an argument i 've recently heard on tv against building a large mosque in bucharest was `` not even the ottomans were allowed to do that '' . 
  but like i said , it 's probably a special case . 
  grapes , had a good crop because of the drought this year . 
  unfortunatelly it was too hot during the initial days of making the wine , which will thus not reach its potential . 
  ca n't say i 'm happy for that , but i did learn a lot this year ; first time i pruned the vineyard myself , identified and stopped a mildew attack in time , got some winemaking tools , etc. 
  at the very least , i 've got myself some good rakia  and 500l of wine of dubious quality ( do n't ask , we just planted way too much for our needs ) . 
  the vegetables in our garden are far less interesting . 
  to 9 % actually , not that it 's any difference . 
  they 're having tax evasion problems with agro products for a long time , and vat fraud is one of the largest issues . 
  coupled with stronger enforcement , vat income was actually higher after the tax decrease . 
  i have n't seen an in-depth analysis yet , but on the surface it looks like it may have worked . 
  somewhat similar looks , and there 's the fact gypsies originate from india ( centuries ago ) . 
  people , especially in eastern europe countries where they are a significant minority can be racist towards them , sometimes quite openly . 
  it 's a very long story ... 
  but i doubt indians would have any problems whatsoever . 
  i know a group of pakistani that 's been in romania for a bit longer time and this subject actually came up once in conversation ; they never had a problem . 
  it seems it 's more of a theoretical idea that it could happen , but in practice it does n't . 
  i 've met * russians * believing the us would have invaded * them * from crimea , had putin not taken it from ukraine . 
  in comparison , this looks almost sane , i 'm afraid . 
  the russians admitted the incident happened , did you read the article ? 
  there was some warming up of our relations following their russian mishap , though ( e.g. 
  state visit by iohannis , poroshenko addressing him in romanian , etc ) . 
  let 's see where this goes . 
  [ here 's a summary of billateral relations before that ] ( http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2011-12-30/ukraine-romania-a-sustained-deadlock ) . 
  ps : i 'm laughing my ass off every time the notion that romania poses a military threat ( present or future ) to ukraine is entertained . 
   i do n't know how it was under ceausescu . 
  same . 
  in bucharest at least , roasted sunflower seeds were sold invariably by gypsy ladies ( along with turkish turbo chewing gum ) , which had their spots in the city and were somehow tolerated by the police . 
  they came wrapped in a newspaper `` cornet '' and iirc it cost a bit under 1 leu ( a beer was 5-6 lei ) . 
  que hora es . 
   this is literally the law in every country . 
  fwiw , not here . 
  sovereignty belongs to the people , they exercise it through representatives and also referenda ( art 2 of our constitution ) . 
  this has the funny side effect that non-binding referenda can be sort of binding , that 's what the constitutional court thinks anyway . 
   i do n't question grandpa . 
  hehe . 
  as long as it works ... 
  cheers !, 
  out of curiosity , do you only make whites ? 
  reds are not pressed immediately , you typically want your wine to pick up color from the skins so after crushing ( and maybe destemming ) you leave them for maceration at least a few days if not till the end of fermentation . 
  also , never heard of anyone doing a co2 purge . 
  why ? 
  the moment fermentation starts it will give off massive amounts of co2 which will expel all the air behind the airlock . 
  a bit of oxygen is actually useful at the beginning , the yeast needs it to multiply before anaerobic , alcoholic fermentation starts . 
  so , do you only make whites ? 
  those people are obsessed with oxidation . 
  that 's what it is , spam . 
  it was relayed by an open mail server in czech republic on a home adsl connection and the html version of the email has an image link to a replica store something something ... check ` view source ' . 
  ( sandra pralong helped establish the soros foundation in romania in the very early '90s . ), 
  looks like the state is not providing you with sufficient ointment for that burn , comrade !, 
  i suspect the 2 large loops on that pole are cable ends from cables that have been cut , not just reserve . 
  not everywhere cables have been taken off the poles after being relocated . 
  [ for example this one ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.4444566,26.1305357,3a,75y,312.61h,105.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-lvv0z8up15qveguf3nmmq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) , most of those cables are actually going nowhere , if you look at the timeline you 'll see they were cut sometime 2010-2011 . 
  it being close to my home , i can say it looks the same today , with all those cables hanging to the ground :-), 
  out of country connections and general peering arrangements are just fine , not sure where you got this from . 
  here 's a download from ftp.sunet.se : upc : 24.0 mb/s ( that 's megabytes , maxxing out my home 200mbit connection ) rds : 11.2 mb/s ( maxxing out a 100mbit elsewhere ), 
   puff away at a hookah non-tobacco only , unless it 's outside . 
  it changed a lot over time due to the various special taxes being declared ilegal by either ecj or local courts . 
  iirc in 2007 , for a more affordable second hand car ( 2-4k eur ) , you 'd pay 2-3 times its value just to register it . 
  it was n't denmark-insane , but we do n't have danish purchase power either ... 
  how do you think car ownership is discouraged by policy , if not by making it unaffordable ? 
  it 's also very much the case with romania , in your table . 
  a lot more people would have afforded a car if not for insane taxation . 
  not sure what it was like in the ussr , over here even owning currency was a criminal offense . 
  to get something from the `` shop '' you had to have connections or rely on e.g. 
  foreign students to get it for you . 
  does this include the tugboat ? 
  had the same question but then i read the article . 
  they mean sibiu , which actually makes sense . 
  the organized crime part is a bulgarian special , we do n't have/never had much problem with that . 
  check the cvm reports for example , the organized crime part is only on bulgaria . 
  corruption , on the other hand ... 
  so , basically over here you probably would n't end up dead as an anti-corruption prosecutor , it 's `` just '' that your career would be over , family harrased , stuff like that .
