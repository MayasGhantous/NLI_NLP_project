  it 's only kinda true for vrancea earthquakes , as explained by others they 're typically deeper thus lower intensity . 
  other seismic areas ( e.g. 
  banat ) have damages from lower magnitude earthquakes . 
  the reason people here are afraid of these vrancea earthquakes is that on average every 40 years or so there 's a 7 + one . 
  the last big ones were in '77 and ' 86 , which had lots of casualties . 
  bucharest happens to be dangerously close , with a population of ~ 2m . 
  there was a stronger one in [ 2014 ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/cutremurul_din_2014_%28rom%c3%a2nia%29 ) , right after the elections ( cue jokes ) . 
  we 're not japan , but they [ are ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/list%c4%83_de_cutremure_%c3%aen_rom%c3%a2nia#1946_.e2.80.93_prezent ) common enough . 
  well ... on elections day , they ca n't sell alcohol in stores within 500m of a polling station . 
  so it 's technically not anywhere , anytime :p, 
   the higher minimum wage pushed all the wages upwards did it though ? 
  [ percentage of minimum wage workers has doubled ] ( http://www.capital.ro/s-a-dublat-procentul-angajatilor-cu-salariul-minim.html ), 
  `` fa\u021ba '' has the [ definite article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_grammar#definite_article ) , `` fa\u021b\u0103 '' does not . 
  pro tip : it is . 
  it 's called [ zero rating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-rating ) , and fuck the telekoms for even trying this shit . 
  it 's a bulgarian national that `` owns '' the car , not you . 
  along with his other 270 cars that the bulgarian tax authority never bothered to ask how he acquired as a pensioner :p the other option afaik is to set up a dummy company in bulgaria .

   the collapsed and heavily damaged buildings are very old , almost historical buildings you mean like the ones in [ pic 3 or pics 6 & 7 ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/08/24/foto/_terremoto_le_prime_foto_dei_danni_a_norcia-146519480/1/#3 ) ? 
  i 'm not saying there 's a problem with your building codes , there probably is n't , but i 'm almost certain there 's a problem with following them . 
  it 's bogus . 
  train classification changed in 2012 to the european system ( regio , interregio , etc ) . 
  whoever published this in 2015 did n't do his homework . 
  if you only look at unemployment stats , minimum wage can probably still be increased with relatively little damage to the economy . 
  official unemployment is still going down despite massive relative increases of the minimum wage in the last 2 years . 
  it does , however , kill all prospects of ever finding any sort of job for the rural poor , at the same time killing local business . 
  these folk are absent from the stats , as they probably never claimed , or even could claim , unemployment in their life . 
  as a rough calculation , working 20 days as day labourer , you 'd get now something like 180-220 eur cash in hand with no taxes paid , no insurance , all black . 
  this is at best 80 % of the current net minimum wage . 
  to employ you , a company has to pay 345 eur for minimum wage . 
  for many local businesses , this is ... not easy . 
  those are just that guy 's guesses . 
  meanwhile , the [ finmin ] ( http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-finante-21222251-ministrul-finantelor-temerile-legate-posibila-revenire-perioada-anterioara-crizei-nu-sunt-intemeiate.htm ) has another story : `` this is sustainable growth , based on 15 % growth in investment spending , 9 % growth in the construction sector , and a reduction of retail sector growth . 
  business services accelerated from 7.8 % in q1 to 9.5 % in q2 . 
  this demonstrates the growth is not based solely on consumption , but also investment '' . 
  i 'll take the ins numbers vs guesses , thank you very much . 
   the advance ** must have been ** driven by private consumption , '' nicolae covrig , economist with raiffeisen bank romania sa , told bloomberg . 
  `` the performance of the industry ** should have remained ** weak in the second quarter , '' while `` net exports ** might have had ** a negative contribution , '' covrig argued . 
  his analysis ** could have been ** interesting . 
  in what parallel universe does the original article and article title translate to this post 's title ? 
  * diicot ( organized crime and terrorism prosecution office ) wo n't investigate further * police is checking whether any violation of firearms regime actually happened ( these are hunting weapons that can be legally owned ), 
  minimum wage has [ doubled in 6 years ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/economie/stiri/salariu+minim+romania+evolutie+comparatii ) . 
  it 's important because some 40 % of the workforce gets that ( at least on paper ) . 
  in a sense , he 's right ; they have n't grown at the same rate , lol . 
  [ your taxes are insane ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/11573695/where-in-the-world-can-you-pay-the-least-tax-on-alcohol.html ) for wine . 
  since none of our nobelists got the prize for activity in our respective countries , it 's fair to say we 're equally bad here , 
  digi is n't sharing anything . 
  my appartment building has coax/upc , ftth/telekom and ftth/digi all available at my door . 
  `` natural monopoly '' my ass . 
  while the leu has been quite stable for the last 10 years or so , take a look at [ inflation in the '90s ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/romania-inflation-cpi.png?s=romaniair&amp;v=201607180013n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231 ) . 
  long term contracts and high value items are still expressed in eur ( previously usd , dm , etc ) out of the need/habbit to use a stable currency for them . 
  to say that people need to convert in eur for valuation may or may not be hyperbole , 
  the [ tanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tr-85 ) are outdated ; from what i gather , they need a 125 mm cannon vs current 100mm , bigger engine and more armor if they 're to match opponents . 
  targetting and the rest of electronics are ok-ish . 
  the bulk of the inventory is older soviet and romanian-built t-55s though ... 
  the [ helicopters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iar_330 ) are an old design , with various upgrades . 
  you do know most of our tanks are local built , yes ? 
  not disagreeing or anything , you just picked the worst possible example  edit : on second thought , helicopers are the second worst possible example , as they 're also local built ... 
  sounds like it 's different in poland then , over here i think only hobbyists are using the `` free '' dvb-t transmission ( they botched the implementation hard , with delays after delays ) , everybody else is on cable or satellite , which means they get more news stations by default . 
  the main public channel is the only one still transmitting analog to the end of this year , but i doubt there 's too many people still using only that . 
  `` future shock '' by alvin toffler is still an amazing read ( it was written in the 70s ) , i 'm guessing from your question you have n't read it already . 
  did i mention it is amazing ? 
  if you like wine and are ever back in bucharest , just hit one of the wine bars . 
  this is the most hassle free way to get good wine , restaurants and stores can be hit and miss . 
  ( i also have to do this , sorry : 90 % of what murfatlar sells - our largest and better known winery - is indistinguishable from spent battery acid mixed with gasoline ), 
   why the president would be urged to take this particular stance ? 
  being an out of phase autist as per usual . 
  romanians somewhat admire poland for their post-communism development , and many in diplomacy are looking for a close alliance with them since we have rather similar strategic interests . 
  these are of course reasons to tell poland to get their shit in order constitutionally , but yeah ... 
  sixth smurd crash since 2003 :( i 'm starting to doubt this is just bad luck . 
  if that analysis were correct , the positive output gap would bring inflation , which is n't really happening . 
  on the other hand , it is true that in the economically growing regions it 's becoming somewhat difficult to hire new people . 
  we also have general elections this fall  i 'm only an armchair economist , but i think what 's actually going on is up to subjective interpretation . 
  albania is at most 2 years behind , i do n't think your two countries joining together is that far fetched , especially since unfortunately the eu has bigger internal problems lately than bringing you into the fold . 
   this leaves us with only one option , the pp-dd it 's them . 
  hover over the red segment of the graph . 
  but like you said , they were far lunatics rather than far right . 
  this . 
  for completeness , when your winter temperatures often drop below -16 . . -22 c , depending on grape variety , you need to protect the vines by burrying , which in turn makes the whole thing very labour intensive . 
  you are also fourth largest wine producing country , which you 're exporting largely to eu ( and canada ) . 
  it 's interesting to know , you do n't even drink that thing :p, 
  being lectured on human rights by an israeli lefty -- priceless . 
  so were the czechoslovak ** socialist ** republic , romanian ** socialist ** republic , to say nothing of the ussr . 
  beautiful tatras . 
  a shame they 're hidden in all that foliage . 
  so i guess it 's uncommon ( i am not an italian speaker ) , but if you search for `` l'elefante nella stanza '' you 'll find it not strictly in explainer texts . 
  newpapers , blog posts , etc. 
   it was fairly crass to expect he would immediately understand the meaning of `` an elephant in the room '' we have this expression in romanian , and a quick search shows it 's used in italian and french as well . 
  i think it 's fairly well spread . 
  eh , i finished [ this wine ] ( https://images.vivino.com/thumbs/hnfxl5tvrai88znym2cyjw_375x500.jpg ) yesterday . 
  provided you know that st. emilion is in bordeaux on the right bank , it 's arguably a better label than `` 65 % merlot 35 % cabernet franc '' . 
  our polish friend would have none of that , though . 
  thanks , i 'll check them out . 
  tbh , after seeing its color i 'm more interested in their cramposie , 
  interesting , which babeasca neagra did you like ? 
  bulgaria is perfectly set up for the good cop-bad cop method . 
  actually , those are much worse from an astronomy pov . 
  with the older lamps you could use a narrow blocking filter and tolerate some moderate light pollution , but the leds produce `` white '' light ( full spectrum ) .
