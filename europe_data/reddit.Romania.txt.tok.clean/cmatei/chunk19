  it 's actually a village in luxembourg . 
   it seems somewhat hypocritical for the european parliament to demmand visa free travel for these countries when these countries have not joined the schengen area spot on . 
  most people buy them [ pre-formed ] ( https://www.albinuta.co.uk/en/79-meat-rolls-mici ) , ready to grill . 
  otherwise , here 's a [ 1920 recipe ] ( https://ro.wikibooks.org/wiki/carte_de_bucate:mititei_carul_cu_bere ) , of which google translate makes a semi-understandable mess . 
  a better comparison would be [ chiftele marinate ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ay1eww3im5g/hqdefault.jpg ) , usually together with mashed potatoes . 
  if you squint at the right angle you 'll notice they 're different than the turkish cedilla . 
  they could be cleaner , though . 
  eh , the 39 % is out of the official total which is borked . 
  we have n't had 18.9 million total voters in a long while , if ever . 
  the in-country turnout for general elections is around 50 % as well ( expats all vote in a single , ridiculously small constituency for their numbers ) . 
  do n't laugh . 
  i basically grew up with [ leka nosht detza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgxxe4t-rtg ) and studio x , in the '80s we only had 2 hours of tv , to ` save electricity ' . 
  in my family we started learning bulgarian because of this , but i think this was in '89 as we did n't get very far ... rejisior na dublaja : elena popova :-), 
   just hand a government bags of cash or even bully them yeah , that 's not needed . 
  we only need to know which way they 're coming so we can set up the fanfare . 
  you know what else changed ? 
  the percentage of people paid minimum wage , from 8 % in 2011 to 44 % in 2016 . 
  but hey ... let 's legislate wealth . 
  sounds like a brilliant idea . 
   romania would n't have been occupied had they not invaded the ussr alongside germany just like bulgaria , no ? 
  not to mention poland or czechoslovakia . 
  someone is going to have a nasty surprise with their property tax , is n't it ? 
  this could backfire for pis . 
  the electoral register is messed up , this has long been a problem . 
  it distorts turnouts and electoral thresholds . 
  it 's actually 18.9 m now due to some changes in how expats are handled . 
  estimates of in-country voting age population are 15-16m , iirc . 
   there were several other protests in the 150k range in bucharest during 1990 . 
  the largest was piata universitatii in april-may , larger than the jan/feb demos . 
  fuzzy memory and all , i do n't remember that being anywhere near this big . 
  the square is much , much smaller than victoriei . 
  wikipedia quotes 30-50k from newspapers . 
  the protester to gendarme ratio today in front of the govt . 
  building in bucharest was something like 100:1 . 
  i do n't think that 's an option at this point . 
  it is not constitutional , the govt . 
  ca n't do * organic law * by emergency ordinance ( they can do other laws , yes ) . 
  it would fail at the cc for this reason , and also because it 's not an emergency . 
  the catch is it does n't matter . 
  if it 's in force for just 1 minute then repelled , this becomes `` most favorable penal law regime '' . 
  it may well be the largest since 1989 . 
  i do n't know about the place you 've been , but a lot of mountain huts here are supplied by backpack and/or donkey because nothing else can get there . 
  40e is a bit steep , but you have to cover for all the other 39 eggs that did n't make it , 
  it 's a bit of a mistery to me at the moment . 
  the defense ministry ` take home ' budget is smaller than last year , but they have credit up to 0.8-0 .9 % ( ? ), 
  gdp available for multi-year procurement programs . 
  much as you imply , the procurement programs that i know of are at verious stages between `` would n't it be nice '' to some mou signed , but no actual work started ( 4 new corvettes + arming the 2 ex-uk frigates , by damen at the local galati shipyard , 800 million eur over 4 years is what i found ) . 
  there was also talk of a few hundred apcs . 
  but this is n't even the final version of the budget , we 'll see what they actually send to the parliament , and more importantly what will actually be spent until next year . 
  draft budget for 2017 that 's being discussed these days puts it at 2.0 x something , i think that 's what he means . 
  i for one will believe it when i see it . 
  according to the constitution prison release and amnesty are subject of organic law ( art 73 , par . 
  i ) and ca n't be done by government ordinance even if they have `` abilitare '' ( art . 
  an oug , however , produces legal effects before it can be contested at the constitutional court . 
  i do n't much care for your travesty so do n't bother replying . 
   the question at this point should be why anyone at all likes him . 
  he 's done tremendous amount of good in romania by hooking up schools to the internet in the mid '90s . 
  shower curtains are the most disgusting thing ever . 
   bureaucratic neoliberal you sure have a way with words . 
  do n't know about belgrade , but in 2012 we had a full ice cap further downstream , at calarasi ( ro ) - silistra ( bg ) . 
  before that i found it only happened in the winter of ' 84 - ' 85 . 
  however , just enough ice to stop the ferry service here until spring is much more common , even if not every year . 
  it is a solar eclipse , and they 're not really that rare . 
  yep . 
  it does n't actually convey any information whatsoever , but the presentation is great . 
  i 'm not really sure why i see some value in this , lol . 
  the dacia sandero ... oh , wrong meme , sorry . 
  the [ speed limit is 70 km/h ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@44.5387298,26.0686992,3a,75y,2.41h,78.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sexdaq9dcgkymkwbi2dmjfq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , like in most villages/towns along the bucharest-brasov part of dn1/e60 . 
  they have bridges for pedestrians , no street level crosswalks . 
  everybody does 90 km/h there . 
  mucenici are really different across regions , as in op 's map . 
  transylvania does n't usually make them , moldovan mucenici look like the pic you posted but in the south it 's [ this thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/mucenici_muntene%c8%99ti.jpg ) .

   bulgarians might be poorer in absolute levels , but their wealth is more uniformly distributed . 
  did they achieve full communism yet ? 
  while 3g is almost universally available , our 4g coverage is [ not that great ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s74s2mj.png ) , either . 
  vodafone is only available in and around the larger cities and digi even less . 
  so which is it ? 
  yes or no ? 
  why is it acceptable in one situation , but not the other ? 
  the question is rhetorical , you do n't have to reply but i think it 's obvious that if your answer is yes you 're a monster and if your answer is no , you have some mental gymnastics ahead to justify it . 
  should single parenting also be forbidden ? 
  the president ca n't do shit about the pm , most of the time . 
  the only time he has some real power is fresh after general elections when he gets to appoint the new pm , or after a no-confidence vote against the government sometime later . 
  if two of his nominations do n't get a parliament approval , the parliament is disbanded and early elections are called . 
  i 've had virsli ( banat region ) like that , i think those are closer to the one in the pic than plescoi . 
  [ as a matter of fact they were ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 9350 \\ ) ) , post ww2 . 
  you are describing the late ceausescu period when we lost most of the remaining germans , but their number was already less than half of the prewar period . 
  i 'm willing to bet it did n't or at a minimum important data was n't obtained from the tests , i guess we 'll see when the final report is out . 
  from the esa press release : `` however , saturation -- maximum measurement -- of the inertial measurement unit ( imu ) had occurred shortly after the parachute deployment . 
  [ ... ] its output was generally as predicted except for this event , which persisted for about one second -- longer than would be expected . '', 
  [ it was us , apparently .

  not necessarily . 
  remember how our electoral lists are fucked up and have 18.3 m voters on them ? 
  that means 5.5 m people need to care enough about this stupid referendum . 
  imho it would still fail and this is a far better option than blocking it in the parliament . 
  sorry you did n't like it , but you obviously forgot all about cantarea romaniei , [ dansuri tematice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fagtxurdaw ) and every other [ silly event ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jict7yvlf5s ) that had nothing to do with ~ ~ russia ~ ~ the soviet union . 
  no , it was football of course .
