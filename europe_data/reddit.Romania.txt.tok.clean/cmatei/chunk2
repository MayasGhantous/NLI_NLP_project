  i 'd like to point out this is about him being a foreign inteliigence officer , not an undercover cop . 
  and he studied , and workshopped , and conferenced and whatevered in a lot of places . 
  in the west ... 
   more high maintenance demanding funny enough , it 's not the f-16 that needs its engine ( oh wait , the two of them ) replaced every 500 hours . 
  i freakin ' love the mig-29 , it 's the most beautiful airplane ever built . 
  it 's extremely rugged too , but in terms of maintenance it 's probably the most demanding there is out there . 
  the portuguese f16s will be operational starting 2017 and there 's too few of them ( 12 ) to count as a replacement . 
  i 'm pretty sure [ the migs will fly to 2020 ] ( http://cursdeguvernare.ro/mig-urile-reparate-si-folosite-si-dupa-intrarea-in-serviciu-a-celor-12-avioane-f-16-din-portugalia.html ) , which is the maximum extension for the existing airframes . 
  after that , it 's ~ ~ fifth generation multi-role ~ ~ paper models most likely . 
  edit : link . 
  yes , they will patch the mig-21s again and again . 
  i live in bucharest but have a country house near the romania-bulgaria border ( silistra ) . 
  i must look like a drug traficker or something because border patrols stop and question me almost every time i go there ( i rarely have to actually show an id , just a small chat ; where am i going , why , where i am from , etc ) . 
  i 'm not mad at all , am actually impressed they constantly filter passers-by , just find it very funny that out of any group of people they 'll always pick me  in contrast , i once met on the road a syrian familly that i 'm 100 % certain crossed the border illegaly . 
  very decent and humble people , running from terrible tragedy , trying to reunite with relatives already here :( i hope they 're alright now . 
   perspective 200 missiles x 10 warheads x 150kt yield ~ = 14000 km2 fully destroyed and 100 % fatalities , 30m km2 thermal radiation strong enough to produce 3rd degree burns . 
  europe 's top 10 metropolitan areas ( by area ) are 14670 km2 ( 43m people ) , and the continent total size is ~ 10m km2 . 
  hope this helps . 
  edit : looks like i misread , it 's 243 new warheads . 
  feel free to reduce by a factor of ten . 
   for the vast majority of people their religious beliefs manifests itself in their voting . 
  that may be a very specific situation in turkey , i 'm afraid . 
  in romania , where unlike western europe ~ 90 % declare themselves believers , religion almost never comes up in political discourse . 
  i can count outspoken religious conservatives in politics with one hand ( and their supporters with the other ) . 
  i understand your frustration with anti-secular movements , but `` for the majority of people '' i believe this is a non-issue . 
   bucharest is seen as much more difficult to reach than warsaw . 
  i can only see this happening if russians had really bad navigation skills . 
  our military is a complete joke . 
  apart from the special and expeditionary forces , they are only useful for the national day parade , they can push back the broken down equipment to barracks . 
  `` share of electricity consumption from renewables '' vs `` share of energy from renewables '' . 
  op 's map includes thermal & all . 
  oh , ok , i did n't get the part where it was a hobby for you . 
  the reason i was asking is that i saw seeing predictions on some weather sites , and i was curious if it 's seen as an important topic for `` you guys '' . 
  i 'll have my own weather station up soon , current focus is on clear sky statistics and related conditions . 
  did you get any training regarding astronomical seeing ? 
  is it something meteorologists know about , or really niche that few people care of ? 
  the raw data [ is here ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-3-inequality-adjusted-human-development-index ) . 
  romania ihdi is 0.702 , bulgaria 0.692 . 
  my only consolation when reading these charts is `` well , it could be worse , look at bulgaria '' ( love you bros ) . 
  are you trying to give me a heart attack ? 
  well , there 's oxygen in the coma , and there are metals including iron in the nucleus of many comets . 
  minerals too , and weathering happens just like on earth , look at the surface , it 's not exactly smooth . 
  color hues will be subtle ( we know it 's very `` black '' ) , but that 's the point of processing the images to a color representation , to see surface variations if any . 
  the moon is also typically gray , but if you boost the saturation there 's plenty of color . 
  i 'm not sure you can so easily dismiss a brown/redish tint . 
   the likelihood of surface being brown is almost nil . 
  how so ? 
  and this is why you do n't editorialize ... he was 14 years old in 1989 , a bit early to be a senior officer . 
  op , y u do dis ? 
   i 'm just afraid that dacia might be an exception . 
  another example would be skoda , the product range is almost identical to dacia . 
   the people there speak hungarian , a great deal of them only speaking that language . 
  that is their form of preserving their culture and protesting against the institutionalization of the romanian one which has been taking place for a hundred years . 
  all according to the 500 years assimilation plan . 
  we have a lot of bulgarian plates ( ahem , taxes ) and the derogatory term for them is `` texans '' - from tx/dobrich where many are registered . 
  and yes , there is some `` fame '' to ph and ab romanian plates for example . 
   i literally do n't know what romania has to do with the jet engine , beyond possibly some obscure early concept or prototype i 'm not aware of . 
  [ henri coand\u0103 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_coand\u0103 ) in case you 're still wondering . 
  we 'll probably never know if he had the concept or not . 
  ~ ~ what spare apartments ? 
  you ( and your family ) were only allowed to own one . ~ ~ right , not paying attention . 
  * nobody was `` given '' anything , you either paid rent ( to the state ) or took a state loan for your own house * *** you were n't allowed to own a second house , being forced by law to sell it within one year of acquiring *** , so you had to do tricks to hide it * *** building or buying houses for the purpose of selling or renting was also forbidden *** * people were not free to move there are many reasons why renting your place ( other than from the state ) was n't common , being `` given '' a home was n't one of them . 
   the communist regime made of point of providing everyone with a home ( even if it was a small shitty apartment ) . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how this worked , someone can shed more light . 
  in theory , you 'd get a `` repartition '' from your workplace . 
  in practice , you lived with your parents for a long time waiting for that , or greased some hands . 
  then you could move in and start paying for your appartment . 
  you also need to remember the cities were mostly closed to outsiders ; you had to have a job there , and jobs were n't exactly open market either . 
  there 's a [ propaganda movie ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/buletin_de_bucure%c8%99ti ) encouraging young graduates to keep their posts in the countryside , the part about fake marriages to get a permanent bucharest id is not entirely inaccurate , 
  in fact it was even more dramatic . 
  it was n't only tenants ( which were tenants in state-owned apartments ) , but also owners still paying their rates that benefited . 
  the prices were fixed at the nominal amount from communist times which inflation wiped out in just a few years ( think 200 + % inflation yearly ) . 
  the cost was n't anywhere near 22.000-55 .000 euros , more like one * tenth * of that . 
  i can only guess the author used the official communist $ exchange rate for this calculation . 
  edit : by 1993 , the price of an average appartment like this amounted to ~ 130 $ , or less than two sallaries . 
  i have no problem believing that  what would be , in your opinion , a good russian beer ? 
  it 's not like we 're importing any , but just in case . 
  when i was in crimea/ukraine they had russian baltika , which was utter shit compared to some ukrainian beers , so maybe that 's why , 
  he did n't exactly lie , he just chose different words to present the situation :-) we * do * have growth year-to-year , because of last year 's good q3 & q4 . 
  obviously he 'll stay away from the word `` recession '' , being in campaign . 
  everybody knows he fucked up badly , but the numbers did n't catch up yet . 
  romania also shrunk 1 % to q1 . 
  europe , you 're screwed now !, 
  you 're right that it 's not a dish by itself , but considering how many things ( hmm , everything ? ), 
  go together with it and how stereotypically romanian it is , it 's not necessarily the worst choice . 
  even if it 's not really all that popular any more . 
  reading the education law seems there 's just a basic framework setting the format of diploma/license exams , but the tests themselves are not standardised . 
  however , there 's a body that decides which universities can hold them , students of all others need to pass the exam in one of the accredited ones . 
  i know at some point private uni students had to take the exams at the state universities . 
  when i was in school there was no exam at all ( just the presentation of a final paper ) . 
  these things change at least twice a year so i ca n't be sure , sorry , 
  when they introduced video surveillance at baccalaureate exams in 2010 & 2011 in romania , success rate dropped from 80 % to 45 % :-) it 's now back to 60 % partly because they know they ca n't cheat , partly because exams have been dumbed down a bit . 
  we also have the same problem with stupid memorization and it appears nothing is done to reform the curricula . 
  oh shit , a quarter , i thought it was the worst here . 
  i also found an article today saying out of 10 people leaving 3.2 are high-school graduates , 2.4 in apprenticeship , 1 craftsman ( ? 
  ) , 3.5 basic education ( 8 grades ) and only 0.6 higher education . 
  so maybe the actual brain-drain is not as bad as it could be , it 's `` just '' people with obvious marketable skills that are leaving . 
  he 's not `` just '' a media mogul . 
  he 's one of the better known former-securitate-turned-capitalist after ' 89 , with extremely toxic connections to romanian politics .
