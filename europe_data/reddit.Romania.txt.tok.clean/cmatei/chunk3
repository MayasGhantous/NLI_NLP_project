  it is , a few pics here : [ salvation cathedral ] ( http://basilica.ro/stiri/stadiul-lucrarilor-de-la-catedrala-mantuirii_19127.html ) . 
  haha , i know what you mean , but i just looked this up in the previous bus thread , 
  before 2000 or so , we were indeed late . 
  if the phone network was n't utter crap back then we 'd have also spent years on isdn and ( early ) dsl , maybe up to present times adsl . 
  because those were n't available , cable ( which was already faster ) simply exploded . 
  not a lot of countries use ( d ) so much cable as we did . 
  but this is pre-history imho and does n't really explain current status , which is fiber almost everywhere . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  time heals all wounds ... 
   bucharest 's trolley looks like a transformer ... we only have 1 of the type pictured , another earlier [ protototype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9fosrd6nxs ) , 100 of [ these ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/91-iveco-citelis.jpg/1280px-91-iveco-citelis.jpg ) and 195 of [ these ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/bucharest_ikarus_trolleybus_1.jpg/1280px-bucharest_ikarus_trolleybus_1.jpg ), 
  it is a frozen conflict . 
  when you say it was dissolved , it implies resolution , which did n't happen . 
   the conflict was dissolved on 21 july 1992 who 's delusional , again ? 
  ist fantastisch accent , no worries, 
  bulgarians : any details ? 
  opinions ? 
  will it get built/get support from the new gov ' t ? 
  party pooper !, 
  there 's 100 of these and 195 of the older ikarus type in use . 
   these funds ca n't be tampered with , so our fine institutions prefer not using them this is not the only reason . 
  corruption aside , for a eu project to go ahead it needs partial funding from our gov ` t. 
  they do n't really like that because of budget restrictions , so they prefer to let go . 
  heard this twice in the last two weeks from people running eu projects . 
  eh , bad choice of words . 
  what i meant was [ a large chunk ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/sectors_of_us_economy_-_firms_with_payrolls_-_sales_vs_employees_in_2002.gif ) of the economy hardly uses any energy or resources , so this proposed taxation scheme does n't make sense . 
  what you 're saying made perfect sense 100 years ago . 
  most economies are now revolving around services . 
  another version : an iranian and an iraqi are exchanging gunfire during the war . 
  the iraqi gun jams and he stars swearing , in romanian . 
  gunfire stops and the iranian goes `` you there , how come you speak romanian ? '' . 
  astonished , the iraqi responds `` i studied medicine in bucharest . 
  how come you speak romanian ? '' . 
  `` i studied medicine in targu mures '' . 
  the iraqi quickly fixes his gun and resumes firing , `` take bullets , you stinking bozgor '' . 
  ( told with strong accent typical of middle-east medicine students ), 
  yes , we had them in cinemas . 
  the difference is there 's no historical uk resentment for their politicians to fuel . 
  many of us are quick to point at your politicians in anger because we have n't had that kind of nationalist/populist discourse in politics for a good number of years , and we were expecting the same of you . 
  the remaining anti-hungarian sentiment was going down nicely , but this is n't helping at all . 
  anyway , it seems like our ~ ~ current pm ~ ~ fresh new presidential candidate is going to play this card as well in his campaign , the little genius that he is , so we 'll have to get off this high horse soon enough if that 's the case . 
  think of the last 25 years : no more large/prestige projects together , no more contraband goods for us from `` the serbs '' , our economic troubles in the '90s , yugoslavia disintegrating in wars where we sided with the west - even if not the most popular option at the time , ~ ~ no more gasoline smuggling together hehe ~ ~ , us going for nato and eu , serbia getting too cosy with russia for our taste , etc. 
  kind of like your best buddy in school that you have n't seen in a long while . 
  also , the question in the poll is horribly open-ended and lacking in context ; `` rather negative feeling '' does not mean dislike , particularly when it 's not clear what the feeling is about . 
  yes , instant value is probably maxed out right now because we have severe floods . 
  but i think it should give some idea over 7 months . 
  incidentally percentages are almost the same for same period of 2013 for hydro and wind , and 0.03 % solar , 0.00 for biomass . 
  and i was n't seriously comparing , just made me curious to dig up the data , 
  romania ( [ this instant ] ( http://www.transelectrica.ro/en/web/tel/sistemul-energetic-national ) ) : 42.00 % hydro , 3.73 % wind , 2.78 % solar , 0.82 % biomass . 
  year to date : 29.38 % hydro , 8.16 % wind , 1.41 % solar , 0.78 % biomass . 
  romania stronk !, 
   but romania should n't do this because of the republic of moldova . 
  that 's exactly why romania should do this . 
  the question was definitely not the same and they 're before this year 's events , but you can infer from these two polls in [ march ] ( http://www.diacaf.com/actualitate/pe-cine-considera-romanii-dusmani-si-ce-cred-despre_164834.html ) and [ december ] ( http://www.caleaeuropeana.ro/sondaj-ires-aproape-jumatate-dintre-romani-considera-ca-ungaria-si-rusia-sunt-dusmani-ai-romaniei/ ) 2013 that ca n't be true . 
  you can also see a shift from 27 % enemy/50 % friendly perception in march vs 48 % enemy/31 % friendly in december ( after vilnius and related events ) , overtaking hungary as # 1 `` enemy '' . 
  it 's probably much worse now , though . 
   erm , no . 
  [ poll : over 87 % of romanians want the union ] ( http://adevarul.ro/moldova/actualitate/sondaj-87-romani-vor-unirea-basarabiei-romania-1_50aec2a07c42d5a663a00c74/index.html ) just saying . 
  it 's where they cruise , yes . 
  and we know this one was there . 
  i truly do n't know if an airliner looks any different on radar from a nimble military jet , and i 'd rather not go into speculation about it or why would a ground attack aircraft be at that altitude in the conflict zone , rather than much lower . 
  it does however defy common sense that somebody that knows what buttons to push to launch a sam would confuse this target with an an-26 . 
  they do n't go anywhere near 10.000 m. 
  it is also a turboprop , max speed 540km/h . 
  the malaysian plane would have been ~ twice faster at the time . 
  if they could confuse it with anything , an-26 would n't be it . 
  when aa missiles go off they shoot crap like this : [ continuous-rod warhead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuous-rod_warhead ) . 
  they do n't blow up their target , they slice it . 
  it may obviously catch fire/explode after that , but not necessarily . 
   private account holders are usually insured by government up to 100k . 
  there 's 10-20 .000 deposits in all romanian banks above that , depending on who you listen to . 
  the distribution probably has a long tail , but i do n't see ` nearly impossible ' anywhere here . 
  it can be paid cash out of pocket ( reserves ) by the national bank - and you know that 's not what would happen . 
   you can go a step further and say that the problems of the banks were caused by the people themselves because all people have the financial acumen of a bank , no ? 
  of course they have part of the blame , and they should also face the consequences . 
  but tell me you do n't think `` get a personal credit with just your id '' is reasonable , for a bank . 
  i never said they are n't . 
  but that does n't mean they should have their losses covered by everyone else ( worst case : bailouts ) . 
  in romania , there 's dozens of group trials lost by banks due to abusive contract clauses , yet they 're untouchable because `` systemic risks need to be considered '' and no reform is possible . 
  personal bankruptcy laws are not adopted because `` systemic risks need to be considered '' . 
  the `` systemic risks '' were created by the banks themselves , when they handed out bad loans . 
  banks have been allowed in this moral hazard for too long , and they should take back the responsibility for their actions . 
  letting them fail is a good start to achieve that . 
  please , please do !, 
  this whole ` banks are too important ' mantra must die . 
  over here there 's both tax and insurance . 
  tax you ca n't avoid and must pay yearly anyway , but you can skip insurance . 
  [ well done , government !, 
  ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/romanian-prime-minister-accused-of-plagiarism-1.10845 ), 
   romanian police is no longer allowed to collect fines from ~ ~ foreign ~ ~ cars directly ftfy . 
  and you need to pay the fine within 48h or the amount is double . 
  how * hard * one is working is also not a measure of productivity . 
  my countryside neighbors work their fields/on their farms both * hard * and * long hours * , yet the productivity ( economic output ) is abysmal . 
  it 's just an example . 
  a lot of the work is not terribly productive for a number of reasons , such as poor tools being used , poor management , the fact that manual labor is still used a lot because it 's cheap , etc. 
  for the ones doing the actual work , believe me , it can be pretty damn hard . 
  we also use cuca m\u0103c\u0103ii , cucuie\u021bii din deal ( others ? ), 
  as the archetypal remote/backwards villages . 
  this usage is old , they 're [ not particularly remote ] ( http://www.romania-actualitati.ro/cuca-macaii-si-cucuietii-din-deal-41070 ) ( ro ) or poor now . 
  there 's also the town of caracal , `` where the cart of fools overturned '' . 
  famous for having a cemetery on resurection st , a bakery on hunger st , a jail on freedom st , building an apartment block around a crane so it was stuck there and other more or less accurate urban legends .
