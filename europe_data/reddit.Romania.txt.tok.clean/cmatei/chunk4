  now , that 's pan-slavism !, 
  ~ ~ not at all . 
  daca vor aparea si alte efecte vom vedea dupa '' and [ the second was indeed about his local budget ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-7271988-klaus-johannis-reducerea-salariilor-bugetarilor-duce-diminuare-substantiala-veniturilor-buget-din-cauza-scaderii-impozitelor.htm ) . ~ ~ hmm , you may actually be right , as he speaks of income , which does indeed affect local budget . 
  stil , i will have nothing to do with this way of thinking . 
  because fuck arithmetics , let 's do ideology . 
  lowering the wages had no impact on gdp ( it actually grew a tiny bit ) , while the deficit went from 9 % to 6.7 % . 
  `` diminishing state employees sallaries by 25 % will lead to a substantial decrease of the state budget . 
  that 's because all state employees pay tax and they 're a sure source of income . '', 
  this does n't fully explain how i feel , but i guess it 's a good start . 
  i am not sure about the soviet union , but we only had z80/8080/8086 that were originally introduced in the late 70s , nothing more recent than that until 1990 . 
  and only the z80 was produced locally , the others were bought/smuggled . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  ^ ( but it 's just a storm in a teacup ), 
  currently there is no political party capitalizing on nationalistic ideas , so some believe it 's a niche waiting to be exploited . 
  psd has made some very feeble attempts at doing that , far less than pnl in 2012 for example . 
  if recent history is anything to go by , taking this route will ensure they 're burried for good ( see prm and to some extent pp-dd ) . 
  i know you understand at least some romanian , so [ here 's an article ] ( http://sociollogica.blogspot.ro/2014/06/ce-se-intampla-cu-psd-daca-pierde.html ) outlining some scenarios in the unlikely event they lose the presidential ellections this year . 
   situation not yet critical  romania 's jewish population , which now only numbers a few thousand -- down from 728,000 on the territories of greater romania in 1930 -- is not targeted in any policies . 
  talk about fear-mongering . 
  i challenge anyone to hate on psd more than me , but this is beyond ridiculous . 
  it 's not old , it 's 80s design ( candu 6 ) , in operation since '96 and '07 respectively . 
  i doubt reactors 3 & 4 will be completed anytime soon , the wind generation in dobrogea makes the region disproportionate to the rest of the country . 
  i like [ hotnews.ro ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro ) , but not because they are neutral , they have a very obvious centre-right bias . 
  what they are good for however is that for domestic news they almost always publish source documents ( contracts , court decisions , etc ) in complete form alongside their news piece . 
  it 's much easier than looking it up for yourself . 
  ah , i misunderstood you then . 
  still it looks to me like a distinction without a difference ; tunnels , derelict buildings , underground ( not allowed anymore ) , does it matter ? 
  it 's [ known ] ( http://www.gandul.info/reportaj/primarul-ontanu-a-bagat-lumina-in-canalele-aurolacilor-2408365 ) some of them live in the tunnels , even if 99.9 % of the people do n't follow them there , indeed . 
  while sad and a bit cliche , it 's a good story exactly because most people tend to ignore they exist . 
   i can assure you that 95 % of bucharest 's population will tell you that they had no idea of the so-called `` tunnels '' . 
  they were very visible in the early '90s , look up `` aurolaci '' . 
  here 's a 2001 documentary , [ children underground ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264476/ ) . 
  * [ remittances amounted to 4.2 b euro in 2013 , more than foreign direct investments ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/economie/stiri/romanii+din+strainatate+bani+acasa+clasament+explicatii ) * to say nothing of a country like moldova , where remittances are a huge share of gdp ( it was 45 % at some point ! ), 
  so yeah , it 's not insignificant at all . 
  and how many are in this position ? 
  add them all up , then contemplate the 7 % ... it just does n't add up to a working age population of 14-15m . 
  that was my point , `` 7 % unemployment '' is a statistical fantasy and a pr tool for the government . 
  it 's fairly obvious though that most of the missing people are not actually idle , but working on the black market , working abroad or in agriculture . 
  but lacking numbers , we have no idea about how employed or unemployed they are . 
  my village neighbors are mostly unemployed , for instance . 
  there are 348k pfas and 371k companies registered ( end of 2013 ) . 
  where 's that self-employment you speak of ? 
  5.1 m employed out of 21.3 m population . 
  you have 4.5 m at half the population . 
  does it still look low ? 
  it 's a meaningless number . 
   this missile shield is undermining mutually assured destruction ( mad ) . 
  i 'm genuinely curious why you think you should get a free ticket for that . 
  a country like mine ca n't possibly think we could pose a threat to russia , even if we developed nuclear weapons , for example . 
  why do you think you 're entitled to a wildcard , if you can technically be stopped ? 
   i for example , support my party ( an alde-aligned one ) which party would that be ? 
  really , you think extremist far-right is even remotely comparable ? 
  my bad then , carry on . 
   jobbik 20 % fyi , our comparable anti-everybody greater romania party has been below election threshold for the last 2 cycles ( since 2008 ) , from their all time high 20 % in 2000 . 
  so no , you 're not `` getting back to normal levels '' of nationalism . 
  and then there 's fidesz too , going that way ... 
  seconded , i think pretty much everyone did , really  this [ google image search ] ( https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=aventurile+lui+tom+sawyer ) shows just how many modern editions of the book ( in romanian ) exist . 
  i think i still have the [ story on vinyl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ummoyp4_1i4 ) somewhere . 
  surely this is the most notable event during his reign . 
  / s and `` was involved '' is weasel words . 
  romania was a constitutional monarchy , the repression ( which was necessary btw ) was conducted by the liberal government , not by the king . 
  the official , recorded number of victims is 419/421 . 
  the 11000 number was put forward by your marxist colleague constantin mille and repeated ad nauseam by communist historiography . 
  and you . 
   just have marriage defined as a bond between a man and a woman , in the constitution . 
  i think you 're missing the point . 
  in countries that somehow do n't currently have this in the constitution , politicians try/do this for populist reasons to gather votes . 
  putting it in the constitution effectively sets the bar very high when the issue moves to the point where it 's actually discussed whether it should be allowed or not , because the constitution is typically hard to change ( requires supermajorities , a referendum , etc ) . 
  it may be a tabu subject now , but i do n't think anyone really expects it will stay this way . 
  it is totally a dick move , and i 'm somewhat of a homophobe myself . 
  amusingly , in romania such an ammendment was proposed by the liberal party . 
  we have a saying : a nail removes the nail . 
  if simple rehydration wo n't help , electrolytes wo n't help , perhaps it 's time for more alcohol . 
  i have absolutely no idea how relevant this is to most hangovers , but ethanol actually slows down metabolisation of methanol into toxic formaldehyde , so there may be some truth that more alcohol helps . 
  tbh , water works for me 90 % of the time , if not an aspirin and i 'm set . 
  when i 'm not pressed to do something else , more alcohol also seems to help , 
  whatever 's not used from chicken ( organs , neck , claws , etc ) goes into this morning-after soup . 
  soured with pickled cabbage juice , or less optimally bor\u0219 . 
  but really , just drink lots of water , 
  she was general prosecutor before that , for a long time , though . 
   the romanian salarise did surprised me , though . 
  that 's because it 's wrong . 
  that number looks suspiciously like the minimum wage from 2012 . 
  average net in 2012 was 354 eur , and median should be 15-20 % less . 
  alternately , minimum wage was some 45-47 % of median ( gross ) . 
  sorry i ca n't find the actual number . 
  i think by being late to the party he means by us , it 's popcorn time every other week with high profile politicians getting investigated/convicted , with ministers , mps , party leaders , former pm going into the meat grinder . 
  it takes a remarkably small number of courageous prosecutors/judges to get the ball running , then it 's unstoppable . 
  so good luck to you too , our countries both need to get rid of this plague . 
  in romanian , the name comes from the `` road to d\u00e2rstor '' ( \u0414\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u044a\u0440 , nowadays silistra , bulgaria ) , the ancient durostorum . 
  russo-turkish wars ? 
  because google fails to translate it to `` penis '' in russian or anything , 
  [ dristor kebap ] ( http://www.dristorkebab.ro/meniu.html ) in bucharest . 
  it 's a chain now , but people used to go out of their way to the dristor neighborhood for it . 
  ca n't say i love it though . 
   an american woman yeah , she 's much more than that . 
  look up her books . 
   seriously , i sound cynical but this is the truth . 
  no , you just sound cynical . 
  i somehow doubt the hungarians were so focused on western freezers back in 1956 .
