  i 'm actually surprised we have no obvious nutjobs this time . 
  yes , he 's reading it wrong i guess , as i recall from some stats i read some time ago . 
  [ this suggests ] ( http://www.bmwfw.gv.at/wirtschaftspolitik/wohnungspolitik/documents/housing_statistics_in_the_european_union_2010.pdf ) ( pg . 
  51 ) the average useful floor area is only 15m2/person ( 2009 ) in romania , which is lower than everywhere by a large margin ( including bulgaria , for example ) . 
   you should just talk to them . 
  yeah , please do n't  if you 're close enough to `` just talk to the bear '' , you 're waaay too close , which means you either surprised him or blocked his path , neither being a good thing . 
  it can happen , but the rule is they avoid you . 
  do n't run , he may chase and you do n't stand a chance , no sudden movements , no attempts to scare him and back the hell off , facing the bear . 
  in dubious places where you may bump into one at close distance , making extra noises to make them aware of your presence is something a lot of people do . 
  when camping in bear land , never keep any food in your tent , that 's an open invitation . 
  all goes in a tree at a reasonable distance . 
  garbage dwellers and beggars may seem friendly and approach/let you approach , but they 're even more unpredictable and thus dangerous . 
  they prescribe such schools should exist if the parents/local communities ask for it , which is exactly what would happen with `` autonomy '' . 
  google translate articles [ 45 through 47 ] ( http://legeaz.net/legea-educatiei-nationale-1-2011/art-45 ) which imho fall under generic minority rights . 
  the problem with `` autonomy '' is it 's a pretty vague term , you even defined it in terms of `` largely '' . 
  the hungarians here never quite finished thinking about what they mean by autonomy ; what should be local decision and what not . 
  come up with a program . 
  until that happens , the only people talking about it are hardcore nationalists on both sides screaming bloody murder . 
  and there 's no need for autonomy for using hungarian in education and/or administration . 
  they are generic minority rights . 
   i 'm pretty sure you/they could argue about who stole which part of the primordial soup from the other  no , and you know why ? 
  because they * were n't here * !, 
  i 'll never buy tarator again if you fuckers do this . 
  their employer ( rinat akhmetov ) is , he may lose status if separatists win . 
  they 're just being coerced/manipulated . 
  while i 'm on `` their '' side , such mob action has the potential to turn ugly . 
  not everybody pirates , you can buy/download legal hd content . 
  i 've heard stories about such people  having had to download ~ 1tb of scientific data recently , i only wish the internet was this fast , end to end . 
  growth relative to q4 '13 only 0.1 % . 
  and i thought [ we had it bad ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/stiri/inundatii+olt+valcea+apele+se+retrag+avertizarile+se+mentin ) . 
  more rain expected :(, 
  it was and they did  even if they at least could read a map . 
  i do n't know how this idea got popular , but it 's wrong . 
  before that bucharest time ( +1 h44m23s ) was used . 
  we have never used gmt +1 , not during commies nor before . 
  switching to cet is just a populist idea ( yurop ! ), 
  that wo n't hapen . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure about slovakia and greece , but romania and spain did n't recognize kosovo solely because we do n't like separatists . 
  in romania at least , it 's accepted that we 'll follow the serbs in recognizing kosovo , for lack of further arguments against it . 
  so it 's just a matter of time really ( which is unfortunate for both kosovo and serbia ) . 
  there is n't a conflict any more , just slow politics . 
   liberals want romania to switch back to cet zone communists switched us to cet +1 not even the communists had such idiotic ideas . 
  we 've been gmt/utc +2 ever since the adoption of a standard timezone ( 1931 ) . 
  i 'm too lazy to translate all , so here are the relevant bits : -- joint statement of the houses of parliament on ucrainian referendum on dec 1 , 1991 . 
  we salute kiev 's choice for a democratic referendum on independence , blah-blah . 
  considering this referendum will also be held on romanian territories - northern bucovina , land of herta , land of hotin and the rayons in southern bessarabia , the romanian parliament solemnly declares these territories were broken off from the country body , and the ribbentrop-molotov pact was declared null and void , ab initio , by ussr on dec 24 , 1989 and the romanian parliament on june 24 , 1991 . 
  it is of course in ukraine 's right to organize a referendum for its independence , but this referendum can not be valid in the romanian territories abusively annexed by ussr , territories than never belonged to ukraine and are rightfully romania 's . 
  2 . we 're attached to the final act of the osce conference in helsinki , which allows for peaceful and diplomatic border changes . 
  3 . the referendum and its consequences are invalid for previously mentioned territories 4 . we ask all countries that will recognize the independence of ukraine to acknowledge it does n't apply to said territories 5 . we 're open for dialogue with kiev to examine the problems in the way of a good neighborly relation , and in this sense we invite a ukrainian parliamentary delegation to visit bucharest as soon as possible 6 . we ask the government to urgently open negotiations with kiev about the territories forcibly annexed by ussr -- this kind of made sense at the time for most romanians when nationalism was still the main idea , but it was a diplomatic catastrophe . 
  mutual relations went downhill from there . 
  there was the issue of serpent island , ukraine sinking a vessel in the sulina channel to block navigation , bistroe channel , the continental shelf , etc. 
  i think we 're ok now - we only complain now and then about romanian language schools in ukraine , but still far from a warm friendship . 
  it is bs now , but maybe you forgot about [ this ] ( http://mariusmioc.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tm291191.jpg ) . 
  it 's probably not the best approach to claim territories from a country just declaring their independence . 
   you do realize that this is a sure way to make rogozin 's joke into reality but do you realize rogozin preferred economy class back to moscow ? 
  sure you can if you want to , but for the rest of us that did n't negotiate an opt-out it 's sort of mandatory , that 's what i meant by it being no surprise . 
  all eu countries are supposed to adopt it ( except uk and i think denmark ? 
  ) , it 's in the eu treaty , not a surprise for anyone . 
   however , in the context of the marginalisation of romanian culture/traditions/etc within romania , in favour of the newly dominant ones please pass that joint . 
   irregardless is a word commonly used in place of regardless or irrespective , which has caused controversy since the early twentieth century , though the word appeared in print as early as 1795 . 
  [ 1 ] most dictionaries [ citation needed ] list it as `` nonstandard '' or `` incorrect '' . 
  looks like a word to me . 
  lulz . 
  you should hear my countryside neighbors ' comments about the tv campaign saying you should exercise at least 30 minutes a day . 
  alcohol [ ... ] `` you should be careful where you get either of these from since sometimes people will burn tires , if they ca n't afford sugar to make the alcohol and drinking this type of alcohol can blind you ( i have n't met anyone who this has been an issue for , but it does n't sound impossible here ) '' mmm , no . 
  the methyl alcohol content , that could blind or even kill you , is very , very low , even if the proper technique is not followed when distilling ( it just tastes horrible ) . 
  this is an american scare about moonshine from the prohibition era , but even then the few health issues were caused by using improvised/improper stills , not methyl alcohol poisoning . 
  not using sugar because it 's expensive is sometimes mis-represented as a matter of pride ( `` pure fruit , no sugar added '' ) , but all alcohol comes from natural fructose in this case . 
  depending on the fruits used , sugar may even not be necessary . 
  not in any way dangerous . 
  i do n't get the burning rubber part , except for maybe using rubber instead of wood while distilling . 
  i very much doubt even the poorest of the poor do that ( plenty of other less nasty things to burn ) . 
  i got a bit carried away with explanations because i love a good rachiu and this is nonsense . 
  ** tl ; dr trying home made rachiu/tuica/sliwowitz / etc anywhere in eastern europe is not only safe , but a basic requirement for getting along  **, 
   we , and i think a lot of others , open from the stem . 
  why !? 
  anyway , til . 
  they 're faux vanity plates , carriages do n't require registration :-) that pic is in romania alright , [ possibly this house ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/rqcwy ) in certeze . 
  because when v4 was forming , our totally-not-commie president was insisting the warsaw pact should be kept alive and generally sucking ussr 's dick . 
  later when we wanted to join , v4 said no . 
  i do n't blame them . 
  wait till you learn `` b\u0103\u0219in\u0103 '' means fart and his last name is b\u0103sescu !,

  [ why are the french so brainwashed against fracking ? 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-11/fracking-ban-upheld-by-french-court-as-constitutional.html ) i am not really against fracking . 
  i am against fracking without a solid legal basis , which we do n't have , non-transparent leases , and the big f * you local comunities get in return . 
  [ gay bombs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gay_bomb ) . 
   according to our constitution when there is no president , the next in rank is the speaker . 
  it 's the same here btw , so should n't be that unfamiliar . 
   of course we 're last thank you again . 
  i 'm relieved . 
  that 's because you 're neighboring fishes , not russians . 
  and they probably will . 
  there 's [ no power plants in crimea ] ( http://www.ukrenergo.energy.gov.ua/ukrenergo/control/en/publish/article?art_id=36515&amp;cat_id=36514 ) . 
  i 'm not so sure i understand exactly why you 're pissed . 
  we 're not spending even the 2 % gdp on the military we 're supposed to in nato . 
  also , i never got the impression we boasted with our military power , quite the opposite , i feel like our politicians are crazy in their reliance on nato as the panacea for all security concerns . 
  we do n't pose a credible military threat to any of our neighbors , and we really should ( not in the sense of `` i 'm going to squash you '' , but `` prepare for significant losses if you attack me '' ) . 
   we just missed a huge opportunity yes , we really wasted the international calibre of one fm [ titus corlatean ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3waln_p_4s ) or the diplomacy of our president .
