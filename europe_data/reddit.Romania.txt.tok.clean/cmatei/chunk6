  i pray they 're both quieter than an anechoic chamber , really . 
  we 'll probably give humanitarian aid to ukraine if need be , but our involvment in the politics at play would be like lemmings in a minefield . 
   they have ~ ~ guns ~ ~ assault rifles and rpgs . 
  heh , not really . 
  udmr is everyone 's favourite bitch ( sorry :-) to quote wikipedia , `` from 1996 until the 2012 romanian legislative elections , udmr was a member or supporter of every government , except for one year between 2008 and 2009 . '', 
  many times when there was n't a clear majority , they tipped the balance . 
  their politicians are just as bad as the rest of the lot . 
   germany is far away and to ensure our enemy 's defeat the soviets had to go thought east europe yes , but the return trip did n't have to last until ' 58 . 
   people tend to think that we lived like imperial occupiers reaping on the products of our `` colonies '' . 
  [ you sure did . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom ) please take this lightly . 
  it happened quite some time ago , but that does n't mean we forgot and as such , soviet symbolism is out of place in prominent places . 
  homage to soviet soldiers belongs to war cemeteries . 
  [ you ate the troll-bait  ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kmkz.ro%2fde_ras%2ftexte%2ftoate-glumele-despre-cel-mai-cinstit-guvern-al-romaniei%2f ), 
  yes , some 450.000 moldovans ( and ukrainians ) have obtained romanian citizenship . 
  birth right is recognized up to the 3rd generation . 
  the number of potential applicants is thought to be around 6-800 .000 . 
  anecdotally , all the moldovans i know ( family members , several colleagues and a couple of others ) relocated to romania , did n't use the passports to emigrate elsewhere in the eu . 
  i do n't think visa-free travel is that much tied to this . 
  more like it makes sense by its own plus it can help moldova get closer to the eu . 
  crimea is an autonomous republic since ' 92 ... 
   the romanian and moldovan press reacted rather negatively to the abrogation of the law well , they now [ have a follow-up ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.digi24.ro%2fstiri%2fdigi24%2factualitate%2fstiri%2fucraina%2banulare%2blege%2blimbi%2bregionale%2bromani%2bseparatism ) , quoting romanians in ukraine saying the repeal of this law will have insignificant effects for them , since it was mostly not properly applied anyway . 
  pissing off the russian speaking ukrainians on the other hand could have waited for a better moment . 
  yup , as to its fate i knew the same . 
  wikipedia says it 's been moved and [ i found this ] ( http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/salvatoarea-statuilor-comuniste-le-visam-si-noaptea-954702.html ) . 
  the artist seems to be the currator for [ proiect 1990 ] ( https://www.facebook.com/proiect1990.ioanaciocan ) , that puts the funny ( and not so funny ) exhibits in lenin 's place . 
  this still gives me great joy to see , 24 years later !, 
   it would be a truly idiotic decision that could result in deaths of a lot more people but truly idiotic decisions have been made already , and they resulted in lots of deaths . 
  would you rather trust yanukovich wo n't make new ones ? 
  there are rumors that ukrainian `` elite '' are fleeing the country . 
  the guess is these small planes ( they are not airline flights ) which appear to not land at intended destination and rather turn back to ukraine is that they 're not allowed to land due to eu restrictions on certain individuals . 
  it 's speculation , but it does look a bit weird . 
  yeah , i should have replied one level up , sorry . 
  the thing is that i 've heard several times about `` spetsnaz involvement '' and i think it may just be a simple confusion . 
  well , most of the time , hopefully , 
  the special ukrainian police force berkut is named ( in russian ) : \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 ** \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446 ** \u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e ** \u043d\u0430\u0437 ** \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f `` \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442 '' , there 's other `` spetsnaz '' than the hollywood type . 
  we sent an `` appeal '' to yanukovich to stop using force , return to talks , blah-blah-blah . 
  nothing like poland directly asking eu for sanctions , at least not publicly . 
  main ingredients are tongue , olives and leek . 
  it 's very different from all the other stews i 'm used to . 
  jellied tongue sounds really interesting . 
  possibly [ tripe soup ] ( http://www.lamama.ro/photos/pagini_ciorba%20de%20burta.jpg ) ( half of us hate it , the other half is deranged ) , or maybe [ pig brain with things ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vqu12vjecwm/td2mdxtf5li/aaaaaaaabi8/xagwira9gnq/s1600/creier%2bmacelaresc.jpg ) , or [ cow tongue with olives ] ( http://kdmedia.kanald.ro/image/201311/w955/media_332779160_limba-de-vaca-cu-masline-871.jpg ) , or simply [ sl\u0103nin\u0103 ] ( http://combis.infoaliment.ro/photo/combis/slanina-afumata-info994.jpg ) cu [ ceap\u0103 ] ( http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-slanina-cu-ceapa-1.png ) , or the myriad of internal organ stews . 
  not too scary , from what i 've seen itt . 
  edit : oh yes , also [ fudulii ] ( http://fs70.trilulilu.ro/imgs/robi_72/poftiti-la-masa-se-servesc-fudulii_a9729b08f46701.jpg ) ( lit : pride ) . 
  not only pig 's . 
  edit2 : oooh yes , [ t\u00e2rti\u021b\u0103 ] ( http://www.despremancare.ro/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/pilaf-pur-cu-tartite-de-curcan-3.jpg ) , basically a bird 's ass . 
  that 's an article from one year ago showing the ins being way off , and florin citu is a well known economist ( not `` a guy with a blog '' , please look him up ) that simply participated to a nr assembly . 
  he 's right wing alright , but if you follow the self-references in the article you 'll notice he was very much against the prev . 
  government as well . 
   i do n't really feel the local politicians are that afraid of getting caught . 
  often , they do n't strike as being very intelligent either , so your estimate of a decade until anti-corruption activity trickles down may not be that much off , although i 'm a bit more optimist  anecdote : there was a corrupt judges case where they were `` informally '' told by prosecutors - the same that were asking them for arrest warrants and such - that older mobile phones in elevators covered in sheet metal can not possibly be intercepted ( this of course does n't make sense but sounds sciency ) . 
  so they decided to do all their private dealings in the courtroom elevator . 
  the elevator was bugged , of course . 
  while there was indeed growth , some people [ are skeptical ] ( http://florincitu.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/influenta-bizara-a-deflatorului-asupra-cresterii-economice-reale/ ) of the announced numbers . 
  some much more than others . 
  unfortunately it 's not always about the money . 
  there are systemic problems that make people willing to do a good job leave , because they simply ca n't do it here . 
  if you were a surgeon , how would you feel if patients need to bring their own bandages because the hospital spends its money on other `` more important '' things ? 
  sure , this is a trivial example , but you can imagine how it extends to other things . 
  huh , i find the gheorgheni side pretty enjoyable to drive ( ride , actually ) . 
  it 's not 5 minutes , that 's only the touristy area . 
  thanks , let 's not mention ~ ~ cheile bicazului ~ ~ any of the good driving places , these foreigners will fill them all up :p, 
   i do n't think a celebration around killing a pig has anything to do with christian tradition . 
  not making it suffer unnecessarily however , does . 
  it applies to any slaughtering . 
   some people around here think this would ruin the whole experience . 
  you need to hear the pig squeaking !, 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with the `` experience '' , that 's ridiculous ( and against christian tradition ) . 
  it is a practical problem , you want pig 's heart to be functioning when you cut its throat , to drain out the blood . 
  this is also the reason only a butcher/someone experienced does it . 
  stunning can ( and does sometimes ) go wrong . 
  meat with excess blood goes bad much faster ( and tastes not so good ) . 
  yes , we call it the [ calarasi-silistra ferryboat ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.obiectiv-online.ro%2fministerul_transporturilor_din_bulgaria_nu_se_sinc.html ) . 
  from the [ eurobarometer itself ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_397_en.pdf ) ( pg . 
  100-101 ) : `` the countries with the highest proportions of respondents saying that they did * not * report the case are poland ( 98 % ) , slovakia ( 96 % ) [ ... ] '' `` it should be noted that in romania , while 40 % of the respondents say that they did * not * report their exposure to corruption ( the lowest proportion of any country in europe ) , only 3 % say that they did report it , with an exceptionally high proportion of respondents ( 53 % ) unable to answer the question . '', 
  so i see a few options : * my english is very bad * this article is very bad * the eurobarometer for romania is very bad ( i have other reasons to think so ) * all of the above, 
  that 's not an entirey unreasonable assumption , however foreign investment came several years late , after infrastructure development kind of already happened . 
  for instance , in the early 2000 's the * only * long haul transport we had was the national telecom , with 2 stm-4 rings and stm-1 spurs . 
  this is ridiculously low for the time . 
  in a few years , with the market liberalization in 2003 , we had a dozen providers for data transport , and easy access to dark fiber . 
  foreign capital entered 2005 and later . 
  we 're probably somewhat atypical , with foreign investors riding the wave , enjoying the consolidation that was already happening but facing a very competitive environment while doing so . 
  lucky , 
  bucharest does n't have a defined metropolitan area , [ the surrounding towns/communes ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=44.4318&amp;mlon=26.0901#map=11/44.3948/26.1200 ) are not counted , only what 's inside the dotted line . 
  [ there 's a plan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucharest_metropolitan_area ) , but the ~ 1.9 million is currently only the city . 
  the whole area would be ~ 2.3 million . 
  state telecom monopoly terminated . 
  little or no regulation . 
  blind eye to [ this ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2009-05-26-5746982-41-retelele-cabluri-stalpii-din-bucuresti-sunt-prezent-ilegalitate.jpg ) ( sloooowwwly moving underground ) . 
  hobby-ists played a role , many of the `` neighborhood networks '' started non-commercially and were later acquired by the larger isps . 
  competition and price wars did the rest . 
  you can get at least 3g almost everywhere , it 's not as bad as you think .

  scotland , [ learn to play that bagpipe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzjmzfocejc )  ( sadly , i do n't think we have any bagpipe players anymore , or very few ) . 
  edit : same tune , [ better sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2trzdqgzo ) . 
  this is a sensitive topic , as every corrupt person getting convicted these days claims it was ` all politically motivated '  our political scene is such that the president ( currently very unpopular ) is still a main actor , with pretty much everybody else in `` the other camp '' ( 70 % parliament majority ) or so divided they do n't really matter . 
  the president happened to run on an anti-corruption platform , so ... it 's complicated . 
  more so when you see the corruption in `` his '' party ( he disavowed it in the meantime ) . 
  in reality , what also happened was that a number of corrupt judges & prosecutors were also convicted , and many `` chose '' to retire early , so there was at least * some * cleanup in the judiciary .
