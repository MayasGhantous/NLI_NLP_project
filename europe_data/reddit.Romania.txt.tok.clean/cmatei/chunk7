  in my opinion , they started to realize they 're a separate power and started acting accordingly ; for instance , they 're now defending themselves from political interference , with the constitutional court , the high court , the magistrates supreme council becoming rather active in this role . 
  this was unheard of just few years ago.the situation is so `` bad '' that mps actually tried to vote some ammendments to the penal code which would have given them complete imunity . 
  as for what politicians are convicted , the social-liberal alliance parties are somewhat over-represented , but there have been convictions in the former ruling party as well . 
  also , many of the trials are years old . 
  so it 's not exactly you hit us , we hit you . 
  iae , i sure hope this trend continues . 
  romanian entertainment , as of late : what minister/mp gets convicted this week ? 
  there 's also a mp expecting his sentence today after admitting bribery . 
  he 's facing 3 years in jail and the confiscation of ~ 700 eur and a bottle of whisky ( !,

  excellent summary . 
   if it 's true [ it 's not ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ukpps/romanian_president_says_his_country_should/cejd8m9 ) . 
  it 's a sensationalist title , not exactly without an agenda .

  bits from the moldova segment of the interview : '' [ frozen conflict in transnistria ] that 's how you should read my statements before vilnius , because rm must have an alternative solution to continue on it 's european path . 
  and if there will be enourmous pressure to turn away , romania must offer an alternative . 
  keep in mind that romania supports rms suveranity without any reservations , and the unionist sentiment is weak in moldova . '', 
  `` we should start an internal debate in romania if we 'd agree to a union with rm , a debate that should n't matter for moldovan politicians . 
  why ? 
  in a situation where a backturn of rm towards the eurassian union is foreseeable , romania has the duty to offer moldova a possibility to continue on its european way by union with romania . 
  i would n't discuss whether a union without transnistria or gagauzia , too many elements involved . 
  but romania should offer this alternative . '',

  romania drinks ursus black instead of silva dark .

  [ i really do n't think so ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption ) . 
  romania # 8 , uk # 17 at alcohol consumption . 
  not true . 
  it 's just aromatic oils . 
  in brandies ( that never heard anise exists ) , they 're mostly unwanted fractions at the end of the distillation process . 
  pouring water is used as a test , if it turns milky that 's no good .

  i got to it earlier today when it was posted to r/romania . 
  the `` proof '' was a table of gdp/capita by region with bucharest area at 111 % eu average . 
  as i recall , all other regions in romania where at less than 40 % eu average . 
  i can only imagine the mental contorsions you have to go through from this to `` the average bucharest resident is comfortably better off than the average resident of manchester '' .

  do n't judge the left group too hard because we do n't know their story . 
  maybe they protested every week till now . 
  maybe they did n't . 
  it does n't matter . 
  i used their presence there to send a general message . 
  the image is real . 
  interpretations are subjective . 
  the carol is much older than the chimney smoke affair though , and the obvious interpretation in this key is wrong . 
  still damn embarassing . 
  i completely disagree ( secret desire of it happening notwithstanding ) . 
  it 's not the eu that keep giving them our votes , it 's us . 
  our mps voted today on : * general amnisty/pardon that would clear some high profile politicians with pending trials ( postponed ) * changes to the penal code so mps can no longer be investigated for quite a number of things ( passed ) * redefine the conflict of interests so it does n't apply to mayors , gov. 
  members , etc ( passed ) because you see , corruption is just a matter of perception , we really fixed it so do n't need these things anymore . 
  here 's some suggestions for replacements . 
  tbh , chevron is not any better at pr than the government . 
  unsure if malice or just stupid . 
  unfortunatelly , as they all continue like this , it 's going to put a wrench on any mining/resource development in the foreseeable future . 
  he asked for support , not military support . 
  quite a difference . 
   but i have yet to encounter a language that uses c-syntax and does n't use 0-indexed arrays . 
  not very c in syntax but still closely tied to c by design ( easy embedding ) . 
  ukraine would have been handy here ... 
  ok , it boils down to `` this must be wrong because basescu said it ''  he 's not liked at all by the public anymore , and the current coalition won the elections on `` no more basescu '' . 
  so do n't worry , there is wide support for it , either in the form of an actual union or inside the eu . 
  neither of these can realistically happen in less than 10 years or even more , so i guess time will tell . 
  this thread ( and reddit in general ) , is not representative for the public opinion . 
  hell , 63 % agree with president basescu 's recent statements , which if you know anything about romanian politics should give you enough hints on where we stand . 
  liberate the prime meridian !, 
  combined gdp/capita would be lower by less than 10 % . 
  it would be perfectly manageable under ideal situations , but our political class is useless . 
  if instead personal pockets money would flow that way in investments , we could equalize in 5 years tops . 
  add eu money to that and it 's super-easy , on paper . 
  shit , we 're that irrelevant ? 
  we 've been members since 2004  membership in nato and the eu have been a quasi-unanimous goal for all political parties here , back in the day . 
  union with moldova never got the same amount of attention , is what i 'm saying . 
  romanians probably , moldovans not a majority . 
  just before the vilnius summit [ our president said ] ( http://revistapresei.hotnews.ro/stiri-radio_tv-16084102-traian-basescu-invitat-emisiunea-varf-tvr-1-18-50.htm ) union with moldova should be this country 's next big project ( after nato & eu ) , and while he mentioned this can not be achieved tomorrow , and both parties need to want it , insert more ifs and buts here , etc it still prompted a [ response from moldova 's pm ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-16098383-iurie-leanca-republica-moldova-nu-este-pregatita-uneasca-romania.htm ) that moldova is not ready for a union , and their current goal is no borders within the eu . 
  it came as a bit of a surprise , as previously our stance was also `` inside the eu '' , and nobody really had a union as political agenda . 
  ** tl ; dr ** there is support for it , but not universal . 
  most of the countryside has at least 3g coverage though , and along main routes there is also fiber , usually . 
  if geography helps you can get wireless at decent speeds from somewhere nearby . 
  i 'm in the unpleasant situation where there 's tons of fiber 10km away and i do n't even get gsm , unless i climb a small hill in my backyard ( where i could get internet from 3 different providers ) . 
  there 's a huge difference from the cities , yes , but i would n't say it 's bad , on the whole . 
  despite the geographical periphery , i 'm curious why you see them anything but core europeans , culturally ? 
  forget most of politics and economics , that can arguably change in 20 years or so . 
  i would even like russia in such circumstances . 
  hell will have frozen too , by that time , but yeah . 
  i imagine goebbels was also drinking coffee , at times . 
  holy crap !, 
  well , that 's really a lot . 
  it 's in line with what i 've read , but was cautious about the estimate .
