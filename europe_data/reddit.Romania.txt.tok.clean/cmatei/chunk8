  that 's going to be a problem , for sure . 
  thanks . 
  that 's a pretty partisan take ( that i happen to agree with , but that 's not the point ) . 
  do you have any links to some estimate on how much of the moldovan diaspora is actually in russia/ukraine for work ? 
  is it a big deal ? 
  beat this , bulgaria !, 
  it 's a no brainer , go enjoy timisoara if you can . 
  except bucharest which is a lot bigger , from the top tier cities timisoara , cluj and iasi i think timisoara is the one that kept most of its soul over the last 20 years . 
  cluj is too bucharest-like through development , iasi is too bucharest-like even without the development . 
  and bucharest mostly sucks , bar a couple of really nice things . 
  then there 's the normal cities like brasov , sibiu , constanta , etc that have great things going for them if you 're not completely blind . 
  then the small towns where you probably need a guide . 
  then everything else , where you 're on your own and probably missing out on the good stuff . 
  that 's romania , from a slightly drunken perspective . 
  if it was true . 
  in fact , you `` just '' need to have candidates in at least 18 different counties , and you need to gather at least 50k votes total ( national level ) . 
  there 's no requirement to actually win anything . 
  and the party only gets disbanded after failing to do so in two consecutive general election cycles . 
  the current party system is broken by being way too hard on newcomers/independents , but the counterpoint is that we had hundreds of parties in the early '90s , and that is n't very useful either . 
  that 's not a mig-29 , it 's the future pak fa . 
  how dare you bring the most beautiful airplane ever built on this planet into this ? 
  you are apparently not aware which are the parties in power for almost a year now , with 70 % parliamentary majority and running the government . 
  at the very least , get your conspiracy in line with everybody else . 
   educating people over 40 or 50 years old who live in a rural environment bitch , please . 
  look at [ who votes for whom ] ( http://sociollogica.blogspot.ro/2012/11/6-mituri-despre-votantii-usl-si-ard.html ) . 
  last elections have been a massive clusterfuck of irrational voting across the board , in all social strata . 
  food [ * ] , wine ( mavrud , everything targoviste ) . 
  twice i had an `` error '' wine ( programmer here , so i just had to :-) . 
  bulgarians , what 's up with that ? 
  veliko tarnovo and the seaside . 
  i do a lot of shopping in silistra , it 's the closest large town to my place . 
  [ * ] was i just very lucky to only go to good restaurants ? 
  some of my friends now look at me a bit strange , because i told them a trip to bulgaria is worth it if only for the food , and they could n't find any of the good stuff i promised . 
  hungarians bitching all the time about trianon ( and you know you do ) is associated with hungarian irredentism . 
  while i doubt anyone but the usual suspects still see it that way , there 's your explanation . 
  i know what you mean . 
  last i heard , census numbers are not zero . 
  that 's so cute . 
  we just [ glaze them ] ( http://www.goodfood.ro/reteta/negrese-glazurate-101799.html ) . 
  for example , our stores had youghurt from today , from yesterday , the day before ... much variety . 
  43 km/h average speed for passenger traffic will do that to you , or how they handle delays ( `` we do n't know '' , that 's if you 're lucky ) or even announcing the right platform straight . 
  rail travel in romania is becoming very interesting in recent years . 
  again , 
  it 's interesting that so many people still look at serbia solely as the black sheep of the yugoslav wars , even today . 
  i wonder when collective guilt will kick in among the westerners ( mostly ) for this , and the silly `` you 're bad '' attitude will be dropped . 
  but do n't tell brussels i said so , please . 
  the problem with `` gypsy '' is that it 's both used to simply denote ethnicity but also in a derogatory way , really depends on the context . 
  if the pc police is onto you , just use roma or romani and you 'll be safe , lol . 
  edit : i think the double r was just a fad , we more often write `` etnie roma '' than `` etnie rroma '' . 
  that double r is very unnatural in romanian . 
  [ o rly ? 
  ] ( http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/o-rly-putin1.jpg ), 
   regardless of ethnicity and given the free borders , would anybody actually stay in moldova ? 
  this is not even a question , a large portion of the population ( not that far from 50 % !! ), 
  is [ currently abroad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emigration_from_moldova ) , mostly illegally . 
  sure , some of them are likely to chose eu instead of russia and ukraine if that option was available for them , but it would n't be anything new . 
  if anything , working legally would be a plus for everyone . 
  for comparison , the migration rate for romania : -0.25 / 1000 , moldova -9.92 / 1000 ( 2013 estimates ) . 
   then the eu would have to finance moldova massively it 's not that big of a country . 
  for example , the iasi-ungheni gas pipeline currently being built is going to cost some 26 million euros of which 7m are eu money , and could initially ( 2013 except yeah , not really ) cover some 50 % of moldova 's consumption needs , with full capacity covering more than necessary in 3-5 years . 
  what i 'm saying is it really does n't take a lot for big changes . 
  edit : no referendum in sight on either side , a union is not really on anyone 's political agenda . 
  it is imho impossible at the moment : * in romania you have a pro-union majority , in moldova not so * romania is currently not equipped to deal with our own autonomous regions ( szekler land ) , which would probably be the only soft solution for transnistria and gagauzia , if outright independence is to be avoided * new minority ( russian ) , alien and somewhat hostile for romania 's romanians * dissimilar political scenes ( pcrm , soviet union nostalgics in rm ) i do n't buy the economic counter-argument , a union would drop the combined romanian gdp/capita by less than 10 % . 
  easier to grow from there :-) to me , and i 'm a strong supporter of some kind of union having blood line ties to rm , the best that can realistically happen at this point is : a ) romania continues to afford citizenship to the moldovans that reclaim it , raise the number of scholarships for moldovans to study here and be part of the culture , etc and b ) both moldova and ukraine are pulled towards the eu , which would make union a moot point while also nicely solving the transnistria and gagauzia issue ( landlocked small territories ) . 
  i actually think a reunification right now would do more damage than good , should it somehow happen . 
  but i do like the public display of affection of such marches . 
  nominally , yes . 
  but there are still many groups of itinerant gypsies , exactly like lowprof1le said . 
  we have a group that comes every 1-2 years , sets camp outside village for 3-4 days , do some trade ( pots , metal works for the villagers , etc ) and then they leave . 
  they do have a fixed address when asked `` where are you from '' . 
  they are not only tolerated , but kind of welcomed because of their business . 
  i 've seen a number of such camps in other places too . 
  while this is not the `` bad gypsy '' kind everybody talks about , being mostly honest people , they do have their own share of the same issues ( poverty , lack of education , etc ) . 
  because unfortunately natural selection only works on longer timescales . 
  just to further your point , if you go to streetview on that location you will actually see the people on foot selling stuff to lorry drivers while they ... ahem , circle the city at great velocity . 
   also , keep in mind that the metro in bucharest has poor signage . 
  does learning only m1-m4 actually exist , whereas all maps show up to m9999 make a difference ? 
  i was looking for total numbers but ca n't find a source . 
  484 romanian citizens were removed [ from the uk ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-january-to-march-2013/immigration-statistics-january-to-march-2013 ) in 2012 , which includes the 124 denied at port of entry ( which is what we 're talking about ) . 
  does this look in any way like a meaningful advantage to you ? 
  yes , except not really . 
  see [ this ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33152_en.htm ) under `` restrictions on the right of entry and the right of residence on grounds of public policy , public security or public health '' . 
  and this applies with or without schengen membership . 
  it 's the foxes with 80-90 % of the cases . 
  the problem in romania is that we never had a very extensive program for combating it . 
  we only started air-dropping innoculation bait in 2011 , with 2013 supposedly covering the whole country ( 4.5 million baits ) . 
  so maybe we 'll see something in the 2013 efsa report only . 
  i did see [ these leaflets ] ( http://www.ansvsa.ro/?pag=800 ) in my village , so they seem do be doing something at last . 
  are you sure ? 
  over here we have very permissive rules for tapping . 
  you have one court order on national security grounds , bam , they get to tap anyone connected to him , whatever falls through this crack goes to the relevant agencies . 
  i would expect they have some sort of legal cover and this being straight out from the press . 
   also , the nazis never doubted capitalism . 
  pretty much nothing meaningful , for a long time . 
  a law was just passed that allows ( as opposed to mandates ) euthanasia of stray dogs after 14 days in a shelter , and forbids `` re-territorialization '' after neutering . 
  so a dog is either adopted , kept in a shelter or put down , no more release back to the streets . 
  but if you read the press , we 're going to club them all to death , literally . 
  brown bears ( ursus arctos ) actually , some 5000 of them . 
  exactly !, 
  well , i think it is .
