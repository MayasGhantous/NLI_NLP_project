  it 's a landmark . 
  i 'm very curious to see what 's it going to be like , particularly since orthodox churches are typically small and intimate rather than like the large catholic ones . 
  i just so badly hope it is not going to be kitsch . 
  and i 'm not even the slightest bit religious . 
  to where the majority is i do n't think you can have any doubt when 90-something percent of the population declared themselves believers , can you ? 
  in bucharest at least , they 're ever so slowly [ moving underground ] ( http://www.net-city.ro/ ) . 
  turkish and tatar influence is visible the most , balkan not so much ( much less than banat , for example ) . 
  i 'd say the most `` balkan '' thing you can see are some bulgarian houses left after the population exchange in 1940 , when southern dobrogea ( cadrilater ) was ceded back to bulgaria . 
  overall it does n't look balkan at all . 
  dobrogea has/had a very funny mix of people ( turkish , tatar , bulgarians , germans , italians , romanians , aromanians , etc ) . 
  probably the most underrated region in romania , i love it . 
  bila nich beer . 
  seems to be 2010 data , but as you said , it looks incorrect . 
  i wonder if this is due to access to contraceptives . 
  we could tell them , but then they 'd ruin the places . 
  move along , nothing to see here :p, 
   i have never seen the actual milky way with my naked eyes . 
  random advice from a stranger on the internet : get out more . 
  there are ... things you should see :-) on a dark enough sky , you should be able to see the andromeda galaxy naked eye , not only our own . 
  romania * state company : 7.16 $ * private company : 3.30 $ 1h50 ' both , 92 km . 
  free wireless internet in the private train . 
  suck it , socialists :p, 
   the law was nullified by the court , so how are businesses not allowed to develop ? 
  after 10 years of effective banning ( 2002-2011 ) , would you put your money in any development ? 
   i understand your point of view , but how is government being government like we would expect any reason to protest the mining development ? 
  the scale of the potential ( and actual ) damage is the reason . 
  on many levels : ecologic , economic , juridic , political . 
  it 's not about preserving the little flowers on the hills , i 'm sorry you ca n't see that . 
  the fact that there many evils in the world does n't mean you ca n't pick your fights . 
  how about you [ get informed ] ( http://www.ziare.com/rosia-montana/gold-corporation/decizie-majora-a-instantei-in-cazul-rosia-montana-1097238 ) about the subject ? 
  tell us how credible , serious , safe , not-involving-corruption you think this project is , after reading them . 
  allianz was not convinced , so they wo n't insure the operation . 
  i visited rosia a couple of years ago , and while it would be a pity to ruin the area ( it really is very beautiful ) , i would not oppose a mining project there if it had the slightest amount of credibility . 
  this one is the exact opposite . 
  you just went full retard . 
  never go full retard !, 
   the dogs rarely kill people , last incident was in ' 11 . 
  [ in 2012 , over 16000 people were attacked by dogs in bucharest alone , with 2 children and one adult dead elsewhere . 
  that was friday , but then he [ actually said it  ( http://revistapresei.hotnews.ro/stiri-radio_tv-15484963-ponta-votul-meu-deputat-impotriva-proiectului-rosia-montana.htm ) `` as mp i 'll vote against the project '' . 
  [ problem ? 
  ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/p480x480/1174952_654333097925060_1838482488_n.jpg ), 
   now both of them are great supporters of the project . 
  this is hillarious . 
  the prime minister is `` not so convinced '' by the project he just approved . 
  i ca n't help noticing how `` lack of a job '' is a different motivator . 
  bad , racist me , i 'll show myself out . 
  you are exaggerating . 
  they may be used as scapegoats at a local level in certain places , but aside from the greater romania party ( almost extinct now ) , there was no `` all our problems are due to them '' talk , anytime . 
  there is no institutionalized hate , it 's at a personal level , only shows how professional some of our institutions are . 
  and i really do n't know where you pulled the `` cocalari '' ( chavs ) from ... youtube comments maybe ? 
  and anyway , if that was perfectly valid shit , by all means now is the time to send back some of the same , with our best regards . 
  as far as i can tell , overall the only thing that changed due to the gypsy flame-fest we had is how openly ( or not ) we trash them in public . 
  it 's not nothing , but not much either . 
  i hope you all realize the population of moldova is 3.5 million , disregarding this : [ emigration from moldova ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emigration_from_moldova ) you fit all possible stereotypes if your argument is going to be that `` it would cost us a fortune '' . 
  i agree on the politics , but this ... 
  i do n't even know what to call it . 
  disclaimer : my grandmother swam across the prut to escape the soviets . 
  meeting her family again in 1990 , after 50 years , was quite a watershed . 
  no , we almost certainly do n't . 
  2015 was a target at some point , has been pushed to somewhere 2017-2020 . 
  we will eventually adopt the euro ( it 's part of the eu treaty ) , just that nobody is in a rush at the moment . 
  just wanted to clear this up , the rest of the confusion has been addressed , 
  i would add that in moldova , apart from the minorities , there are also ethnic romanians that disapprove of a union , on grounds that romania `` betrayed '' them several times by handing them over to the russians without much opposition .

  they have [ russian versions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o__woij3vu ) for some of their songs . 
  it was mostly exuberance from new found freedom and hope . 
  we had it here too , huge meetings about it , that `` bridge of flowers '' thing , sending schoolbooks , etc. 
  popular support was there . 
  it was a missed opportunity , realities kinda interfered after that . 
  `` there 's nothing i can do , therefore i need to be compensated '' is an equally nonsensical position to have . 
   the bulgarians are protesting the shitty situation they 're in . 
  they 're protesting against the shitty political class they have , which is made of second tier commie elite & their progenitors , just like ours . 
  we had a similar movement a year earlier , but it was drowned in the political noise of that time . 
  not that your politicos are great , but there are no similarities . 
   i do n't see the connection . 
  bulgaria has small but positive growth . 
  greece does n't . 
  neither controls its monetary policy . 
  so it 's not a determinant factor . 
  just saying `` bulgaria/romania is in shit '' is dishonest , if you 're comparing us with greece . 
  do n't forget where we started from . 
   it 's pretty ironic seeing that bulgaria is now facing months of continuous protests , with no end in sight . 
  what i find ironic is that you 're still unwilling to accept it 's your own damn mess , not germany 's , not the imfs , not anybody elses . 
  at least bulgarians realized that , which is why they 're protesting . 
  their currency is pegged to the euro ( to put it mildly ) after the hell they 've been through in ' 96 - ' 97 , so stop blaming that either . 
  and if you really want to know what austerity means , perhaps you should ask them . 
  tl ; dr no godwin 's law with stalin, 
  american is a race now ? 
   are you fucking joking ? 
  perhaps the phrasing was not ideal , but i would be all for it to make it illegal for government to demand from me documents in proprietary formats , or to run windows-only applications to produce said documents . 
   and then when i say those soldiers did nothing to deserve disrespect except they did , then and there . 
  they raped and pillaged . 
  this is what they 're well remembered for , not their heroism . 
  i very much doubt this is the version you hear in your history class , but it is what it is . 
  try to understand that . 
  i know we were enemies for a while , i know atrocities were commited by all sides , but these things happened while we were allies . 
  monuments to the soviet soldier are * extremely * offensive in these parts , even without considering what happened after the war . 
  i would not read too much into that , though . 
  we did n't because we had that `` i 'm independent from moscow , who wants to touch me '' ~ ~ charade ~ ~ policy going on , started by dej and continued by ceausescu . 
  he got lots of upvotes for it , both locally and in the west .
