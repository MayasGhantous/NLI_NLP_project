  but i still think , nuking an entire city , with the vast majority of victims being civilians , still means going full retard , especially when you 're supposed to be the good guy . 
   when there is literally no chance of any retaliation that would mean you consider nato to be simply bullshit . 
  russia nuking a nato member is pretty much unprecedented , so you ca n't know for sure what would happen . 
  us has spent many trillions on its military , much of the technology is secret , as far as we know , they might have weapons to generate an emp pulse that could completely neutralize russia . 
  or cyber warfare . 
  nukes require technology to work , more so than most other weapon systems . 
  russia has a big scary army , but we have to remember its funding is only a fraction of that of nato . 
  i do n't think they would be effective against russian icbms . 
  plus , i 'm sure if russia were to attack with nuclear weapons they would also launch a lot of decoys to confuse the missile shield . 
  ok , that does n't sound very reassuring ... fuck , i 'm too young to die . 
   because it would mean incurring the full wrath of nato , the single most powerful military alliance on the planet ? 
  i do n't know what to say , 15 years of ruling a country like russia with an iron fist would take its toll on anyone . 
  i do n't think putin is very anchored in reality these days . 
  what if he thinks it would be a good idea to nuke kiev or even tallinn or warsaw ? 
  maybe he thinks that 's the way he can prove `` the impotence of nato '' . 
  also , can we be sure , that nato would be willing to nuke russia if it nukes some baltic or eastern european city ? 
  there would be outrage of course , but a full scale nuclear war would pretty much mean the end of civilization as we know it . 
  now seriously , russia has been talking about its nukes a lot these past few months . 
  is anyone taking the risk of russia going full retard seriously ? 
  do we even have a backup plan if russia does go full retard , or will it simply be the end of civilization as we know it ? 
  this is pretty much virgin territory , no one ever went full retard when it came to using nukes , except the us . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.zf.ro/companii/cea-mai-vanduta-bere-din-romania-11634784 ) from 2013 , the most popular beer in romania is [ timi\u0219oreana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkcb8iee780 ) . 
  unfortunately , here in romania , it 's pretty much compulsory to have a facebook account if you want to have a social life . 
  in universities , even exam grades are shared through facebook , not to mention other important information . 
  also , many prospective employers want to check out your facebook account . 
  it 's also much easier to get dates or even friends with benefits on facebook than in real life . 
  afaik , romania abandoned conscription in 2005 . 
   alun\u0103 , m\u0103r , ou , boab\u0103 , gogoa\u0219\u0103 , par\u0103 , these are fucking confusing . 
  bloo * mm * berg , seriously ? 
   nope , just putin and his gang of ** criminals ** , my putinbot . 
  ftfy . 
  $ 120,000,000 it 's mentioned in the article . 
  yeah , but in the us mcdonald 's is cheaper , they have unlimited refills for drinks , free sauces etc. 
  and also pay their employees like 4-5 times more . 
  if they used real chicken in states , they would probably be bankrupt by now . 
  tbh , international restaurant chains are n't that popular here in romania , in my city for example , you can usually find more customers in some random serbian fast food restaurant than at mcdonalds . 
  if mcdonald 's was n't open 24/7 and did n't have mcdrive they would probably be bankrupt by now . 
  their profit decreased 50 % between 2010 and 2013 . 
  running them into the ground is probably not going to be very difficult . 
  but i would n't celebrate it , i do n't like mcdonald 's , but it does employ a lot of people , especially young people . 
  the company had a net profit of only $ 3 mil in 2013 , down from $ 6 mil in 2010 . 
  so i think $ 50 mil . 
  is a fair price . 
   btw , i thought romanians were ferocious anti-russians . 
  seems that , economically , you 're very humble . 
  we are anti-russian , but it 's not like your average romanian has a say in what is a private business deal . 
  i do n't eat at mcdonald 's , so i ca n't say i will be boycotting it either . 
   how would the ad companies reach me ? 
  i do n't watch broadcast television , listen to commercial radio stations , i have tight spam filter and i browse the internet with adblock . 
  am i not worthless ? 
  if you have a facebook account you 're not worthless . 
  they can still learn things about your friends through your account and your friends might be more receptive to advertising . 
  i once read an article saying that facebook might be experimenting with ocr to identify brands in your photos . 
  so for example , say your friend wears a lot of lacoste items , and you have some photos with that friend , tagged . 
  then they will be able to serve him ads for deals on lacoste shirts , shoes etc. 
  without him ever having to use the word lacoste in any of his posts . 
  in the end , storage and bandwidth are relatively cheap , facebook still makes a lot of money regardless of people unaffected by advertising or using things like adblock . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  for a simple reason - facebook and other social networks make money by invading your privacy , not protecting it . 
  you see , facebook users are not facebook 's customers . 
  they do n't pay any money to facebook directly . 
  their customers are ad networks and companies and user data is their product . 
  it 's a business model built on making money from your private data . 
  facebook and similar networks make money by knowing as much as they can about you , not less . 
  [ it 's like this in timisoara ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6yrviw9.jpg ), 
  they 're increasing the speeds so quickly here , i had to upgrade my router 3 times in the last 6 or so years . 
  that 's assuming you only use the us and romanian layouts . 
  i also use russian and hebrew . 
   also , even those that use diacritics often use the wrong ones . 
  that 's generally because of people still using xp or `` romanian legacy '' layout ( the one that also uses qwertz instead of the correct qwerty ) . 
  the mac [ also has them wrong ( with cedilla ) on the keyboard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7vpxlml.jpg ) , but they show up correct on the screen ( with comma ) . 
  theoretically , using the diacritics is mandatory , however , they are usually left out in not so formal contexts . 
  i try to use them as much as i can , but it can get annoying , especially since i use a mac at home and a pc at work and the [ keyboard layouts are different ] ( http://i.imgur.com/60wxs07.jpg ) . 
  the pc layout is particularly bad , as it makes accessing some symbols harder , making it more convenient to just use the us layout . 
  also , trying to type with diacritics on the phone slows you down significantly , i 'm actually surprised people from other countries actually use diacritics all the time . 
  now ukraine 's army is almost as cool as moldova 's . 
  they have like 43 of those wheeled coffins . 
   it probably costs more to ship them back to the us than to just make new ones . 
  we probably save money by giving them to ukraine lol i think a humvee costs about as much as a ferrari , doubt it costs more to ship them to the us , but yeah , the us is probably phasing them out , so they need to go somewhere . 
  unfortunately , the ukrainian army is quite incompetent at urban warfare . 
  the only way they managed to capture any rebel held city or town until now was by shelling the shit out of that place . 
   just to make sure this is not left unchallenged , i 'll point out the obvious : not even a shred of evidence exists to support this statement . 
  tbh , there is that recording of victoria nuland and geoffrey pyatt discussing who to put in charge and how ukraine should be run . 
  i do n't like russia either , but if there 's one thing for certain , it 's that things are n't black and white , especially when it comes to big powers like the us and russia . 
  blackwater does n't exist anymore , it 's academi now . 
  but shhhh , do n't tell the russians . 
   a romanian saying is `` the bowed head is cut by the sword '' . 
  maybe that 's some hungarian version of it , the saying is `` the bowed head is ** not ** cut by the sword '' . 
  although i do agree it 's probably the worst saying we have . 
  neither are bosnia , switzerland , norway , iceland , albania part of the eu . 
   his generally accepted birthplace was in the freidorf ( szabadfalu ) suburb of the current city of timi\u0219oara , romania ( german : temeschburg , hungarian : temesv\u00e1r ) the village is in romania . 
  i do n't know what the russians were planning , but saakashvili managed to make it look like he was the one who started it . 
  as for the parallel with crimea , it 's a really though question . 
  if a robber points a gun in your face and asks for your wallet , do you give it to him or do you an hero ? 
  what russia did was wrong , there 's no doubt about it , but if you are a small , poor , non-nato , non-eu country with a shitty army like georgia , confronting russia is the worst thing you can possibly do . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  he was born in freidorf , a suburb of timisoara . 
  how is it untrue ? 
  it 's been proven time and time again that no matter who is in power , there will always be a tiny elite that has far more leverage over the government and parliament than the common folk . 
  it stands true for every country that ever existed .
