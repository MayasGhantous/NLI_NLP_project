  the only way that could happen is if ukraine agreed to federalize , then those regions hold referendum on joining poland and romania , respectively . 
  another scenario would be if right sector or some other extremist group took over ukraine , placing the ethnic minorities in danger , then poland and romania could simply annex those territories with international backing , it 's not like ukraine could do very much about it . 
  anyway , both scenarios are pretty far fetched . 
   qebap , it 's a turk kebab bread with greek gyro and french fries . 
  it tastes like eating a turk , a greek and a french in one bite . 
  yeah , except french fries are n't actually french . 
  sometime before hitler invaded poland , i guess . 
   so humans have a right to get `` aborted '' ... oh joy . 
  i just wonder , what are these `` humans '' according to far left ? 
  well , if you think about it , sometimes it would be better to get aborted than growing up with a shitty life and become a problem to society . 
  just think about the kinds of women who would abort childre , . 
  very young mothers , too immature themselves to take care of a child , hookers , whores , drug addicts , very poor ones and so on . 
  i do n't have any hard numbers on this ( i 'm sure some can be found if you know where to search ) , but it 's rather common sense that an unwanted child has a higher chance of becoming a failure in society . 
  i think it was probably around 1938 , but i 'm not sure . 
   a gate like those was built a few years ago in the us embassy here [ this is it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v8wu0xt.jpg ), 
  speaking of southeast asians , we have a few filipinas working here in romania as baby sitters , other than that , very few interactions with southeast asians . 
  there 's little racism here in romania though , unless you 're a gypsy . 
  oh , so i imagine there 's still a strong anti-kebab sentiment in serbia since it 's remarkable the people forgot about the religious differences . 
  come on , the war is over , this is 2015 . 
   i would also like to point the good job of the people in serbia , who forgot the religious differences of the passengers amist the accident . 
  what do you mean ? 
  could we go over all this emotional yugoslav wars shit ? 
  i 'm from western romania , we 've always been chill with you guys , never got into wars and shit , but you have to admit serbia was n't exactly the most peace loving country back in the 90s . 
  you really did some crazy shit back then , sure , the kebabs and croats were n't any better , but can you guys stop it with the whining and just move on ? 
  is this even an important topic in serbia/republika srpska ? 
  only heard stories like this regarding the serbian-romanian border during the yugoslav wars . 
  today , even [ that border is pretty civilized ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3hmw8ud-vc ) , at least they have benches where to put your stuff . 
   shaven armpits = probably gay are you from croatia ? 
  if so , guess i need to remember not to shave my armpits when visiting croatia , lol . 
  well , its true that it 's not only the dutch 's fault , but they were there protect civilians and failed miserably . 
   the attorneys responsible for filing the suit , axel hagedorn and marco gerritsen , of the amsterdam law firm van diepen van der kroef , spent years preparing their brief . 
  in it ** they paint a picture of a force that was incompetent , disinterested and solely concerned about the health and wellbeing of its own soldiers . 
  **  ** even the training of the un peacekeepers for the mission in the balkans was extremely unprofessional , the lawyers write , charging that they were sent to bosnia without adequate training in the first place . 
  **  the light weapons carried by the dutch battalion , known as dutchbat , ** also proved to be completely unrealistic . 
  ** ** the unit was careful not to appear too warlike , instead preferring to come across as peaceable . 
  ** but this stance would come back to haunt them . 
  by early 1995 , only about 10 percent of dutch convoys actually made it through the serbian ranks , leading to dramatic shortages of ammunition , food and medical supplies . 
   the bosnian serbs , led by radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , were able to gradually prepare their assault against the un-protected zone , where there were about 40,000 bosnians . 
  ** but the dutch remained persistently lethargic . 
  general bernard janvier , the french commander of un forces in zagreb , told a national investigative commission : `` if we had had 400 frenchmen in srebrenica , things would have been different . 
  we would have fought seriously . 
   there where soldiers standing with hand guns facing main battle tanks . 
  running or dying was all they could do . 
  yet they did n't run , they just stood and watched as mladic 's forces proceeded to remove kebab from area . 
   almost 12 years after these crimes were committed , subasic 's descriptions have acquired new force . 
  especially now that she has reported that bosnians were not the only ones to witness such barbaric acts . 
  according to subasic , a dutch soldier stood by and watched as the women were raped , even listening to music on his walkman . 
  a dutch soldier also witnessed the murder of the baby , she says , and yet he `` did n't react at all . '', 
  in romania ( in my experience at least ) , it 's common for women to lick/suck the balls when giving head . 
  feels good tho . 
  fish n ' chips are n't that bad to be honest . 
  even though the dutch military does n't have a very good reputation ( dutchbat anyone ? 
  ) , can they please invade us ? 
  we want legal weed and hookers !, 
  is n't that common in croatia as well ? 
  i mean , considering a lot of you guys go to the beach every summer . 
  in romania , it 's very common for younger men to shave their armpits and also their pubic hair ( although many , including myself , limit themselves to just trimming the pubic hair ) . 
  some even shave more than that ( like their chest , legs ) but that 's usually limited to sportsmen , metrosexuals and gays . 
  i noticed in austria , men also usually shave their armpits , but in the us , very few do , which i found kinda weird . 
  try fitting an american in there . 
  lol . 
  question : is it common for swiss people to work in switzerland , but live in a neighboring country ? 
  because really , that 's what i would do . 
  there 's some volvo cars out there with more than 5 million km . 
  are there any pics of those vienna siemens trams hitting cars ? 
  if it 's belarus , why is the text on the tram in russian ? 
  well , russia is an artificial state , it will collapse at some point , just like the ussr before it . 
  whether that happens now or in 20 years , it 's somewhat irrelevant , because it will likely happen in our lifetime . 
  we can only hope it will be more like the collapse of the ussr , not like the collapse of yugoslavia . 
   also , is n't it ironic that yeltsin 's `` failed state '' russia was the kind of russia we in the west would still want around ? 
  i 'd personally like a russia that just minds its own business . 
  it just seems the russians are incapable of behaving decently in foreign affairs unless they are in some deep shit internally . 
   yeah , well , nukes in russia are a reality , and the fact that there are crazy people in russia who , unlike putin , would n't shy away from using them , is also a reality . 
  being crazy is one thing , being suicidal , well , that 's rather different . 
  russia has been through some crazy times , like the dissolution of the ussr and the nukes did n't start flying . 
  they did n't start flying when russia was close to being a failed state under yeltsin . 
  why do you think they would start flying over the demise of putin ? 
   as for rebuilding the ussr ? 
  you have the wrong guy for that , seeing as some putin 's political opponents criticize him precisely for not trying to rebuild the ussr . 
  oh really ? 
  then what 's up with invading other countries and his eurasian union pet project ? 
  i do n't think a civil war in russia would be that bad . 
  i mean , hopefully excluding the nukes out of the equation . 
  something like chechnya 3.0 , it would n't be nice , but it should keep them busy enough to fuck over their plans of rebuilding the ussr . 
  has putin ever been absent for so long since becoming president ? 
  how likely is it that he 's dead/about to die ? 
  nasa 's security is shit . 
  every other month here , there 's some news about some romanian who hacked nasa . 
  [ tinkode ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wrfolof.jpg ) , [ iceman ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xyusfkj.jpg ) , [ guccifer ] ( http://i.imgur.com/glvivyg.jpg ) have all hacked nasa at some point in their `` careers '' . 
  inb4 ukip is not far-right . 
  these fucking islamists still manage to make putler look like the good guy . 
  the nsa is probably forwarding your information to the fbi right now . 
  good guy sweden gives $ 100 mil . 
  zero interest loan to ukraine , meanwhile , scumbag switzerland makes deal with russia to sell them $ 100 mil . 
  worth of arms . 
   first and foremost : how could you not appreciate greece for its cultural contributions ? 
  today 's greeks are as related to the ancient greeks as much as the french are related to the ancient romans . 
  the gyros of today are very different from the ancient greeks . 
   judging by what i saw during my visits to greece i believe they should be somewhere in the same group with romania and bulgaria economically ( although in these two countries i saw more desire to work and overcome the bad situation ... and also more industry and potential ... unfortunately nobody trowed billions of euros at them ) yup , that 's exactly why i do n't sympathize with the greeks . 
  they had it all , took it for granted , screwed up and now blame everyone else except themselves .
