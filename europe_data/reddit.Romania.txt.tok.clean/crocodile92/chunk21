  rom\u00e2nia can not into schengen :(, 
  in russian , a sandwich is buterbrod . 
  what 's the logic in that ? 
  shit , why would you call a cucumber `` pepene '' ? 
  that 's so confusing . 
  in western romania at least , it 's pretty simple , a cucumber is '' castravete '' , a melon is `` pepene '' and a watermelon is `` lubeni\u021b\u0103 '' . 
  well , he did get 3.68 % at the last presidential election . 
  if [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlynrumxgya ) can get even 3.68 % , and be an mep , it 's pretty embarrassing . 
   extremist parties do n't even get 1 % of the vote here , and we have a minority head of state . 
  what ? 
  15 years ago vadim tudor almost became president . 
   romanians care way too much about what others think of them . 
  fact is , more than 3 million romanians live outside the borders . 
  of course its important what others think of them since it impacts how they are treated in those countries . 
  look at britain for instance , the politicians and media there have made the public believe that romania is a big ghetto full with lazy people that ca n't wait to get a plane/bus ticket and go to the uk , especially england and claim benefits . 
  it 's true there is an extremely visible minority of romanians , that want easy money by not doing shit , but it 's just that , a minority . 
  so its important that we take care of how our country is viewed abroad . 
  i think * real * islamists in russia are far more likely to attack government figures than opposition ones , given russia 's history with the chechens , involvement in syria etc. 
  it sound much more likely the assassin ( s ) were a bunch of kadyrov thugs . 
  pretty much looks like it . 
  i 'm still curious how the situation will develop . 
  i wonder how the russian public views the eu . 
  probably they view us as brainless us slaves . 
  yup the us govt . 
  is pretty assholish . 
  not just towards other countries or people , but towards their people as well . 
  i think it 's time for a change . 
  but a deep change , like having more than two parties in congress , less power to the corporations , more taxes on the rich etc. 
  yeah , but if everyone carved their initials in the colosseum i doubt its going to survive that long . 
  yup pretty much . 
  i 'd say the median romanian are the `` babe '' , old ladies in their 60s , 70s and 80s . 
  they fill up every possible bus , trolley , tram and subway , because they can ride for free and always demand you to give them your seat . 
  oh , we have quite a few homeless women here in timisoara . 
  i know one of them , simo , she will show you her pussy for the equivalent of 20p . 
  with other homeless women its worse , you need to give them 20p to avoid unexpected exhibitionism . 
  simo also has a `` boyfriend '' , homeless too , everyone calls him `` boss '' , because he used to be a businessman , but gambling got the best of him . 
  where 's the border ? 
  yup they also charge money for crossing afaik . 
  pretty unlikely , in eastern romania , it 's pretty easy to cross illegally into bulgaria and back using backroads . 
  in the worse case scenario you might get fined , but they do n't really care , since both countries are in the eu , so not much smuggling that can go on . 
  however , on that specific road , now there seems to be some buildings on the romanian side which were n't there when google streetview photographed it . 
  you can see them in the satellite images . 
  it was probably designed without a border control , because schengen hopes . 
  that 's likely why it 's closed . 
  btw , [ here 's a video of a road from romania to hungary that 's being built ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipw3x5doqsg ) , also apparently with no border checkpoint in mind ( you can see the border at 5:18 ) . 
  yeah , but still , urban centers are further away from each other in romania . 
  the only important urban centers connected via motorway are bucharest and constanta . 
  if you go from bucharest to the hungarian border , more than half of the road is not even motorway , but when you enter hungary , you can go all the way to lisbon without leaving the motorway . 
  hardly surprising , whenever there is money to be made through dubious business , the swiss are never far away . 
  hardly surprising , greece is broke , they 're probably even selling asphalt now to repay the debts . 
  was it [ this bridge ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2cvrwmx.jpg ) ? 
  it 's pretty notorious for being extremely shitty . 
  there 's rarely any control when you cross from hungary into romania or romania-bulgaria . 
  sometimes there are checks when crossing from romania into hungary , but they 're generally more interested in trucks which might carry contraband cigarettes from serbia/ukraine/moldova or migrants from shitty countries who sometimes get into romania from serbia and try to go further west , but most of them are caught by romanian border guards when attempting to cross from serbia because the eu invested a shitload of money into romanian border security . 
   it just seems like a huge waste of funds to keep these borders and faux schengens . 
  yeah it is , the ro-hu border and ro-bg borders hardly have any sort of security . 
  not illegal unless you get caught . 
  yep , the main problem these days with schengen seems to be bulgaria and their corruption problems . 
  there have been talks to decouple romania from bulgaria , but germany fears this as it may push bulgaria into putin 's grip . 
  likely not going to happen , it would have made headlines . 
  the source is from december and basically it 's just donald tusk saying ** he hopes ** romania and bulgaria can join in march . 
  with opposition from germany , i really do n't see it happening . 
  the crossing is new and the border checks are done on the romanian side apparently . 
  with the current arrangements , romania and bulgaria can only enter schengen together , however , i have n't heard anything about the possibility of joining `` next month '' . 
  do you have a source on this ? 
  if its an old source its irrelevant since romania and bulgaria have been joining schengen `` next month '' , `` next october '' , `` next march '' for about 4 years now . 
   romanian \\ bulgarian border is the danube . 
  geography fail . 
  bulgaria and romania share a land border on the eastern part , the danube border is only to a point . 
  if german roads are n't first world , then britain and the us must be in the africa league . 
  what do you mean , the eu does n't physically remove borders , it just guarantees free travel for people in one eu country to all the others . 
  normally , to join schengen , if you border non-eu countries you just need to have really good border security . 
  both romania and bulgaria comply with schengen standards but are being kept at the door because some asshole politicians in some member states ( especially in germany and the netherlands ) are doing everything in their power to prevent romania and bulgaria from joining , mainly for electoral purposes , because in reality , romania and bulgaria joining schengen would have a virtually null impact on migration . 
  well putin is really trying to gain power on all fronts , but the most important for him is the domestic front . 
  rt is clearly aimed at a foreign audience , that 's why it does n't go full retard like \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b or life news . 
  but i think rt is mainly used to discredit the american , eu and nato institutions and make people in countries like france , britain , the netherlands etc. 
  vote for people who he either funds ( like marine le pen ) or people he could likely work with ( like nigel farage ) . 
  and maybe austria ... maybe ... maybe not . 
  edit : [ found this ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/268157/ranking-of-the-20-countries-with-the-highest-road-quality/ ) . 
  apparently , portugal and austria are doing better than france and the netherlands . 
  i 've never driven in portugal , but i find the austria part hard to believe . 
  you put your money where your mouth is . 
  i was referring to the belgium-netherlands crossing , from the picture it looks like a motorway , or at least a dual carrigeway . 
  from my personal experience , i can say the average road quality in romania is better than in bulgaria . 
  however , bulgaria has 625 km of motorway while romania has 700 , which is pretty shitty for romania considering it has twice the size and 3 times the population of bulgaria . 
  the eastern part is land . 
  the danube borders look decent , [ especially the calafat-vidin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_qmuztqiu ) one . 
  lol , is n't that ... like ... dangerous ? 
  i did n't imagine motorways like this even existed in europe , let alone the western half of it . 
  probably because it was built with schengen in mind so it does n't have a customs outpost . 
  [ street view of the place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dvmpjoo.jpg ) [ also , border between romania , serbia and hungary ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nyfvoup.jpg ), 
  huh bruce lee in bucharest ? 
  [ we also have an aurolac in timisoara who calls himself bruce lee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pabjaq7kjwe ), 
  would have been better if it showed greece already at the bootom , lol . 
  in romania , homeless people generally fall into one of three categories : 1 . 
  the kids from orphanages that were paraded on western tv 25 years ago and have now become adults in their late 20s or early 30s . 
  orphaned kids who run away from orphanages . 
  mentally ill individuals or drug addicts . 
  they are generally seen in a very negative light . 
  in most cities they tend to congregate near railway stations and often steal stuff from passengers who are asleep in late night trains .
