  why do i get the feeling he used google \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0438\u043a ? 
   recieved or maybe not . 
  [ this is what i get as a first result for `` russian woman '' .

  my reaction when seeing this : ** \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c **, 
  when europeans generally think about poverty in europe , we tend to think either to eu newcomers ( bulgaria and romania especially ) , either to some balkan states ( albania and kosovo especially ) . 
  but there is a country so poor that it seems like a plot of land was ejected from africa and thrown in the middle of europe . 
  to get an idea of how poor moldova is , first think about a country like romania . 
  go to google maps and use street view to take a look around romania . 
  now compare it to something like britain . 
  the per capita ppp gdp in britain around us$ 38,000 . 
  in romania it 's around us$ 13,000 . 
  in moldova it 's around us$ 3,500 . 
  so basically , the difference between moldova and romania is larger than the difference between the uk and romania . 
  it is also twice as poor as it 's other neighbour , ukraine . 
  the country basically has no infrastructure , the only roads it has were built by the soviets and most of them never even having been maintained during the last 23 years . 
  it is also the only country in europe that is n't a microstate , but does not have even 1 km of motorway . 
  the most developed region in the country , the capital , chisinau , looks like a soviet shell without the lenin statues and the propaganda billboards replaced by commercial advertising . 
  despite the advanced state of degradation the city is in , there are a few people ( so brainwashed ) they believe it 's one of the most beautiful cities in europe ( on par with cities like paris or vienna ) . 
  it 's economy is laughable , being dependent on wine exports and remittances from moldovans working in other countries . 
  it 's not like their wine is world renowned like swiss chocolate for example ( i doubt anyone outside the cis or romania ever heard of their wine ) but seems to be the only product that actually sells outside their country . 
  actually , russia 's favorite method to troll the country is to ban wine imports . 
  they did it a couple of times , each time wrecking havoc on their economy . 
  in addition to it 's economic situation the country has been unable to solve some serious political problems and is experiencing an identity crisis . 
  first is the problem of transnistria , an unrecognised country that is a mix between a soviet reservation and a mafia state . 
  if there 's a place in europe that 's worse than moldova , than it 's transnistria . 
  despite the fact that only around 30 % of the population in transnistria is russian , basically everyone speaks russian and if you are caught speaking romanian you might be labeled a fascist . 
  lenin statues and soviet propaganda feel right at home in this small unrecognised territory . 
  second is the identity problem . 
  despite a majority of the population considering themselves moldovan , there is a major debate wether they are any different from romanians . 
  until last december they used to speak moldovan , now they speak romanian ( of course , there were never any major differences between the two languages , except for the name ) . 
  in school they learn romanian literature and romanian history , but the media and some politicians keep saying they are different from romanians . 
  you can imagine the confusion this creates . 
  in conclusion , what i can not understand and would like to debate , is how is it possible for a democratic country to experience such degradation during peacetime . 
  because in africa for example , there are wars and coups all the time , but this country is europe , it has experienced no wars or coups in the last 22 years . 
  i would like to discuss the probable roots of this anomaly and maybe a possible solution . 
  edit : forgot to mention their extremely exotic political class . 
  the communist party is the largest party in the parliament with 34 out of 101 seats ( at it 's peak it held 48 seats in 2009 ) . 
  it is the only communist party to ever obtain a majority of votes in a democratic country . 
  it 's leaders are extremely interesting : vladimir voronin - grandson of anti-communist fighter isidor sarbu , who became a refugee in romania during the second world war he was raised in communist spirit by his step father . 
  he was president of the country from 2001 to 2009 . 
  during his presidency , not only did he compromise moldova 's relations with romania and the eu , but also with russia . 
  he is notorious for using foul language in parliament , as well as generally being uncivilised . 
  iurie muntean - favorite to succeed voronin as the head of the communist party , this guy behaves like he just came down from a tree . 
  it 's difficult to say what 's worse about this guy - the fact that he is a communist that uses quotes from the bible or that he uses his fists to resolve disputes in the parliament . 
  this 2 meter tall gorilla with no manners would likely not have any chance of getting even an office job in any civilised country , let alone become mp or party head . 
  romanian presidential election is at the end of this year and it 's becoming more obvious that klaus johannis , the mayor of sibiu ( hermannstadt ) and head of national liberal party is going to be the right wing 's presidential candidate . 
  how do you feel about that ? 
  do you think romania is ready to have a minority president ? 
  will he be able to change the image of romania across europe ? 
  every time this clown opens his mouth , it smells like bullshit all over eastern europe . 
  just a summary of bs rogozin has said lately : - he warned moldova of `` poverty '' in case it unites with romania . 
  ( since when is rogozin concerned about poverty in moldova ) - he also hinted transnistria might become independent if moldova signs the aa . 
  - he went to transnistria to collect signatures in favor of independence and take them to moscow . 
  - in a facebook post he autoinvited himself to bucharest on the 31st of august to celebrate `` the liberation of bucharest from romanian fascists '' . 
  he said he wanted to `` celebrate '' together with the romanian president and pm . 
  - he threatened to nuke romania and ukraine personally from a tupolev bomber . 
  all of these are things he said just during the last two months . 
  does russia really need a `` diplomat '' like this guy ? 
  he does n't seem to be particularly competent and says shit no russian or soviet leader ever dared to say . 
  it 's no secret that russia endorses eu far right parties , but lately it 's becoming more and more obvious that these parties have a somewhat intimate relationship with the kremlin . 
  i have not seen a single far right party leader take a strong stance on moscow 's actions in the ukraine , they actually go as far as blaming the eu for what 's happening and even attempt to justify putin 's actions . 
  imho , this just shows what kind of people they are ... justifying the actions of an autocrat . 
  a weaker eu is what they desire and i doubt this `` just happens '' to coincide with what putin wants . 
  a weak eu means a stronger russia , no matter how you look at it . 
  edit : i 'm not talking about far right parties in eastern europe , i 'm talking about parties like the ukip , fn , pvv , fp\u00d6 etc. 
  i recently returned from a road trip to italy ( i 'm from romania ) and i 've stopped for a few hours in ljubljana , the capital of slovenia . 
  i admit i do n't know much about the country , but i noticed that slovenia is much more developed than other former communist bloc countries including more advanced ones like the czech republic . 
  how did a small , newly independent country with few natural resources manage to leave the rest of the eastern block in the dust and reach a comparable level with western europe in such a short timespan ? 
  i 've created an account on vk to see why russians preffer that network instead of facebook . 
  i played around with it , it has a much less refined interface than facebook and i 've missed many features . 
  i 've also read on several security blogs about the many security flaws of vk . 
  besides the enormous amount of pirated content , i really found no reason why russians insist on using vk instead of facebook . 
  and if you just want to view pirated content , that does n't mean you have to use vk as your main social networking account . 
  perhaps some stupid national pride ? 
  fear of being on the same network with international users ? 
  is the russian propaganda telling them that facebook is an evil project of the cia and to stay away from it ? 
  ( as if vk is n't controlled by putin 's allies ) . 
  edit : should have said russian speakers instead of russians , because apparently it is very popular in other cis countries as well . 
  just wondering , for an average family of four ( 2 adults , 2 children ) , how much money would you need ( per month or year ) to make to have a comfortable life . 
  by that i mean affording a relatively spacious home in a good neighborhood , being able to pay all your bills on time , affording to own and maintain a decent car , paying for your kids ' education , going out , going on vacation , eating healthy . 
  you get the picture , having enough to not worry about money very often .

  radu maz\u0103re , a member of the social democratic party , has adopted a hairstyle and mustache similar to adolf hitler and has made a public appearance only 2 days after klaus johannis , an ethnic german , was elected as president . 
  in 2009 he made another public appearance , dressed in a nazi uniform : http://i.imgur.com/lhrpfjv.jpg, 
  to be fair , i think we should exclude ukraine because of obvious reasons . 
  i 'm curious what people think of the quality of life in different european countries . 
  you can cite any reason you like , like people , economy , food , crime , nature etc. 
  i 'm curious how many foreign languages can european heads of state speak . 
  i think it 's important for world leaders to be able to understand each other without the use of ~ ~ translators ~ ~ interpreters . 
  as a romanian , whenever i travel to a eurozone country , i feel like i need to be extra careful with my cash . 
  when euro notes were first created in 2002 , the technology to make polymer notes was already available , so why did they choose paper instead ? 
  russia 's hybrid war tactics are definitely proving very effective and i seriously doubt ukraine will the last country in which they will use them . 
  so which country do you think will be the most likely next target ? 
  will it be moldova ? 
  estonia ? 
  belarus ? 
  some other country ? 
  i noticed people in different parts of the continent have different favorite holiday destinations .
