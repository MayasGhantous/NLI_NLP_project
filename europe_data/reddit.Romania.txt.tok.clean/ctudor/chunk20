  is this supposed to be a vlogger ? 
  recurring story in se europe, 
  you cant do integration in 50 years ... u need 500 ... 
  a hydrogen fuel cell ? 
  yep wood glue , here also . 
  yes like we looked at europe and the embassies when they tried to free the corrupts 1m ago . 
  not with the current russian putin state ... 
  this is the new system of the xxi century it seems : the winner takes all . 
  pretty sad and it does n't have anything to do with the democratic spirit ... 
   ) karma is a bitch, 
  petrol price = diesel price more or less  ) diesel cars cost more but are more efficient , but their engines are more complex and the maintenance is higher . 
  u crazy fkers !, 
  say what ?!, 
  good article . 
  not sure in this case , but yes if you treat people like animals they will become animals ... 
  yes , those . 
  u also where a target of russian aggressive propaganda concerning the aegis capability on them . 
  putin !, 
  rs - that has nothing to do with the environment but all to do with driving experience no matter the costs . 
  ok you tesla lovers ... we will ditch diesel ... 
  we used to export borsec and compared to what we drink ( our borsec ) it is gold . 
  my bad , had a typo that change everything what i meant :  military and law enforcement cooperation and development of joint capabilities should ** not ** be put on the negotiation table, 
  i see , suspected that but wanted confirmation . 
  thx, 
  i do n't see how this would work since you hide you bomb in your luggage for instambul - london , for example , and then u you take them with you during a regional london - manchester flight and boom . 
  also you can maximize the death toll of a specific demographic in an internal flight than an international one , where you might also kill fellow compatriots ( not that you would care at point ... ), 
   common bmd, 
  also i think he hints that in context of brexit : military and law enforcement cooperation and development of joint capabilities should ** not ** be put on the negotiation table ... this is my read , so i might be wrong . 
  tbh i am not concerned with the access but which the ferocity of the exploitation of a resource with a finite regeneration rate . 
  can we just move the space station in europe ? 
  or we are bound by their respective latitude ? 
  norway could buy some aegis equipped ships , like denmark . 
  also missile defense systems can be used also vs other type of missiles not just nuclear . 
  oh fk off already ... 
  :( really hope she will make it ... 
  well we had several cases of vehicle slaughter with drunks killing people the only difference is the motivation but the result is the same . 
  co-what ? 
   ) what 's so wrong about a bit of lobbying to begin with ? 
  i read the ft one and it said the sales boomed , hence the optimism on the pound . 
  the other says its a bad day for business but are they just referring to brick and mortar stores ? 
  2017 : 4 killed ? 
  or we had more ? 
  pound jumps after uk retail sales trounce forecasts ( ft.com ) so which is which ? 
  good time be drown in pussy and booze  ), 
  it was never about the refugees in the uk , their quarrel was with that they considered the unfair competition from east european immigrants . 
  not the best argument , people acknowledge gravity but also know that given a greater opposing force one can marginally cancel the gravitational effect , just because they ca n't exert the necessary force does n't mean they are ignorant of the facts . 
  aint gon na happen dude ... not in the next decades ... 
  believe me ... get people to the edge and they will show the ugly they have tried to bury deep down this last 70 years ... 
  oh yes sorry forgot about that bugger  ), 
  if he only said smth like : the south is using the money they get from eu budget on things that are not productive enough ... i am sure people could have worked with that and arguments could have been exchanged . 
  but considering the tone he said it i think that 's what bothered the most ... 
  and stalin is considered by some worse than hitler . 
   americans exterminated native americans our diseases did that to be honest . 
  americans just finished the jobs ... 
  have none , but if we do n't start doing things now ... the more we try to bury our heads in the sand the more will the answer and final solution will be in a nazi style ... 
  well you can strike bingo mr mayor ... i have a feeling this will end very bad in nazi style ... and a lot of innocent people will pay cause we did n't act properly ... 
  on the bible then . 
  it 's just a procedure , they could as well use the country constitution . 
  well eastern europe ' 48 ... great time to be alive  ), 
  hot chicks ... well sounds about right , 
  it will be a bloody business my friend ... 
  if he considers the south to be drowning on booze and pussy , then he might think the east is drowning on piss and vomit i guess  ) . 
  can you expand a bit i am not familiar with the concept . 
  merci beaucoup !, 
  21 core base kinda dangerous ... 
  in romania a lot of people say they want back to the communist period and ceau\u0219escu was best leader ... 
  i guess we should send them to jail lol, 
  he just turn the other check anyway ... no real accomplishment here . 
  in rom\u00e2nia they also swear on the bible when they are appointed into office ( president etc ) . 
  but i think that it can be changed according to one 's religion .

  it 's called re education ... 
  why does the east hate so much ? 
  apparently not for sex ... 
  if the south is drowning on booze and pussy the east is drowning on piss and vomit i guess  ) . 
  if its not posted by you its a repost ofc  ), 
  yes . 
  and brexit will take a decade  ), 
  basically they want back colonies . 
  what is important is your war readyness . 
  even if you have a lot or fewer military equipment it has to be up to date and in good condition . 
  no one is asking for 1000 tanks , but that those 300 and the men operating them be 100 % operational in any scenario . 
  aye folks ... we ay right in tha middle i see ... grait story, 
  ooook ... u got my attention op '' :d, 
  omg have they no shame ... 
  interesting ... 
  a weird seat ? 
  lol  ), 
  just follow the pope 's advice . 
  dk ur only solution is start making beautiful gracious babies !, 
  and lots of them ^ ^, 
  no need to judge ... from they point of view and given the nature of their criteria they could be very well right . 
  not enough to stick ... if they impeach him it will be probably over corruption scandals as he uses his position to facilitate contracts for his businesses . 
  there is some problem why youth do n't have proper access to decent jobs ... except the lack of experience which is ofc inherent . 
  cause when you have 4 mil people dislocated from 2-3 countries ravaged by conflict it becomes really hard to make a difference between economic migrants and refugees ... 
  tbh i think that for those living in warzones ... comparing their situation with the ww2 one can be quite accurate ... 
  yes there is a correlation between education and religiousness but not a causality one . 
  in our particular case it is high correlated with poverty and non education ... some rural areas are just so backwards one may shed tears ... 
  yes ... i am cause it is correlated with non education ...
