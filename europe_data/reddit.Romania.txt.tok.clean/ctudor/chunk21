  we are the winners !, 
  beat that loland !, 
  no , russia will not be anything except a military super power . 
  it does n't have the demographics or the civil industry base to power such an achievement . 
  on the other hand , india can be a super power by 2050 . 
  in terms of gdp they are not even top 10 . 
  in the ppp valuation methodology they are barely 6th . 
  they only have landmass and resources . 
  in the end it depends on the effects of climate change at a global level in the next 20-30 years . 
  russia might get some advantages from climate change . 
  just paint all greece like this and we will have gdp increase for a decade !, 
  sad ... but we do n't know ... maybe the italians instigated this ... people talk about ... i do n't know ... but people are saying !, 
  the madman has spoken !, 
  tbh when i see him speak he sounds like a retarded person . 
  clinton , the bush , obama are light years away from him ... 
  he lost the battle but his ideas won ... everyone played a form of this ideology in order to be relevant . 
  because those languages are 6th and 7th learnt on the platform , but they are not the 1st in any country . 
  cool to see balkans want into germany :d, 
  my bad i just didnt see he was through the damn window !!!, 
  i think one of the problem with today politics is the level of opportunism some actors display ... 
  yes but it has an artistic touch which i enjoy ... a fit title for this situation . 
  the pun is intended nevertheless ... 
  in my honest opinion i think your german employer will have to ask for a work permit for you and you will be granted access to eu labor market till your contract expires . 
  this is pure speculation for what i would see a reasonable system . 
  yep ... it will catch us eventually too ... but there is still time , 
  magnificent graph !, 
  care to explain the hilarious situation pls ? 
  not here !, 
  ** muh ** ** piracy **, 
  i agree  ) but ... 
  technically making residences out of polyurethane panels is not a bad decision . 
  it is low cost but it can be effective as a short - medium term solution . 
  i think in constanta a developer used this solution and made some social residences with low costs . 
  what matters is to be functional and not be tents ... 
  lol , pocketknife nazis  ) epic, 
  nop nw it will be the hungarian wall  ), 
  some are , like everywhere , but you fail to understand the point . 
  cultural resentment has nothing to do with racism and bigotism . 
  it has to do with the evolution of society and the fact that things are not like they used to be 20 or 30 years ago . 
  there was an article a week ago about a mid size town in france where le pain hs a very high score , people where unhappy cause what was a happy and cheerful town with the city center full of vibrance and colour now is deserted , all shops closed and abandoned buildings cause everything moved in the new shopping center outside the city ... they blamed immigrants and globalization for this ... what can you negotiate with these people ... 
  very comprehensive article but again ... no viable solution ? 
  basically they should negotiate with the people : racial and cultural resentment ? 
  that wo n't be the only line . 
  the bosporus line can easily be broken by greece and bulgaria on the land , which leaves them travel by sea through the aegean for greece or through the black see towards bulgaria and romania . 
  there have been some few cases already in the last 2 years . 
  well they are not far off lol  ), 
  it going to be bloody ... an overwhelmed greece or romania may start sinking the travel boats ... 
  not unless they talk with the russians 1st  ), 
  i know , my bosses are italians and we know when there are holidays there  ), 
  it seems it is not celebrated in italy ... 
  nationalism is a powerful sentiment that triumphs logic sometimes . 
  probably they think not cause next step will be to limit capital movement . 
  does n't matter how much capital you have , cause you are not allowed to buy our assets . 
  auch is this one of the most dangerous vulcanos in europe , or is it vezuvio ? 
  well in romania , we almost had civil war because of the miners in the 90s and we lost a lot of face to the western world because of those events [ ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad ), 
  not saying that they will succeed , i am saying there are some individuals who have nurtured a deep hatred towards the eu , and like the song says ... nothing else matters  ) . 
  ofc we ought not generalize . 
  well the man likes to dream what can i say ... 
  lol you outdid yourself with this  ), 
  some may say that as long the eu project fails it will be worth it and they were the 1st ball rolling ... 
  somehow related to our topic , an article posted on / r/futurology : [ robo-bulldozers guided by drones are helping ease japan 's labor shortage ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9521453/skycatch-komatsu-drones-construction-autonomous-vehicles ), 
  they despise it , but it 's the only solution for some ... 
  we ca n't afford to pay them it seems ... 
   `` i 've been saying this stuff for seven years , and little by little it 's becoming mainstream , '' he says . 
  `` italy is wounded and the hegemonic powers -- france and germany -- are buying it up piece by piece . 
  this operation is almost colonial . '' as do italians in romania they are buying it acre by acre . 
  / s my point being that there is the same narrative that paints foreigners as an occult and concerted force which comes and wants to enslave us all ... 
  heh beautiful ... 
  from the general budget and also from the local budged and from their funds which can come also from other local budgets . 
  basically the churches are tasked to gather money from everyone around the country , both private and public , in order to finance the construction ... in the end it may be as expensive as the elbphilharmonie hall in hamburg ... 
  as our dear patriarch danny would say : you give a buck but know it 's worth it !, 
  who cares ... those hospitals do n't capitalize votes as this monstrosity does ... 
  well from 14 to 19 is no small feat for his party , and in the end he is sure another 4 years of terror will bring him in the 30-40 league next elections . 
   move it job is easier than move a factory yes , on the other hand high educated people also have a lot of flexibility when finding new opportunities , they are more adaptive and have a broader experience . 
  just think of the high qualified engineers who moved from the shale rig to the pv panels . 
  and the end of the day in this very fast pace changing society what matters is to land on your feet . 
  educated people have more flexibility in this process in my humble opinion ... 
  whispering : that is not a car ... :p, 
  basically strategy ... but that does n't mean he is not his own man ... 
  the candy industry  ) ), 
  `` it was a natural phenomenon , nothing to do with us ... 
  my bad , thought a bit also at the ottoman wars . 
  there is also a valid argument of age . 
  we compare a 2000 years old religion with a 1500 one ... 
  remember that 500y ago we had the inquisition and crusades ... 
  i was not referring to pedophilia but to general aspects which were governed by religious dogma , but which were surpassed by society and christianity had to make some concessions ... 
  well in europe we kinda have ... we have 3g/4g with unlimited data also in romania . 
  it has its difficulties but through / throw is not one of them  ), 
  better !, 
  fking autocorrect , thx ill change, 
  if it is true it is an interesting turnover . 
  this might throw the uk into chaos on top of the brexit uncertainties ... 
  oh god ... it will be breaking news all over again ... but nevertheless all the best !, 
  not quite . 
  most of the services are correlated to the income levels . 
  meaning since your wages are 4 times higher so is the cost with those services . 
  as a consequence we pay kinda the same 75 % of our income on income correlated services . 
  the problem is basic goods which have more or less same price . 
  but while my 25 % is 100-200euro , your 25 % is 400-800 euro , and the schnitzels have the same damn price ... 
  usually they use basic services and goods .
