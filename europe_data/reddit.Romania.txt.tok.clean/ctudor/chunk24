  in romania we have no foreigners  ) ), 
  as long as they use same ingredients there should n't be a problem and proportions are within a margin . 
  the problem is for example when in one nutella one ingredient is switched with another cheaper one which is considered inferior in quality . 
  i am sure that there would be an uproar both in france and in germany if that would be the case . 
  but another example would be even in the case of same ingredients for products like sausages which have lets say a main expensive ingredient ( meat ) and secondary ingredients ( other types of fat tissues ) . 
  if in germany you get a product with 80 % meat and in romania you get the same product at a similar price with 55 % meat , we have a problem again . 
  there is n't a rule fits all , it 's from case to case . 
  or the fact that the flavor comes from real spices but in another the flavor comes from cheaper synthetic alternatives to those flavors - even if the end result would be similar ... i think the governments want to ask the eu not to create regulations for each product , that would be insane , but to create a framework in which such practices if discovered and sustained by scientific evidence can be challenged by the rule of law ... 
  the problem flucht , is that indeed this practice came from the time when our ppp was way much lower so they made inferior products but with a way lower price . 
  but atm to my knowledge most of food has similar price range in the west and the east , but they did n't stopped the practice ( which made economic sense 10 - 15 years ago ) . 
  this means that they operate with a higher operational margin in the ee market , while promoting same good . 
  if in the west they use ingredients that are considered of better quality , less synthetic , why is the east deprived of this ? ... 
  just because we are poor and inferior ? 
  also your mc donalds example is not that accurate because no one is fking over the fact that they would use romanian butter instead of german butter or that they use romanian sugar instead of dutch sugar , but that they use in many cases synthetic alternatives . 
  in the cases as mc donalds we would like them use them as much as possible fresh local ingredients if they meet the franchise standards instead of globally shipped craps that are full of preservatives . 
  i think label would be a better form . 
  ps : also in romania we have `` eticheta '' which can mean both ** label ** and way of behavior ( direct english translation ** etiquette ** ) . 
  lol just come to romania my friends  ) we have worse roads :p, 
   ryebread no , it is a different type of cereal . 
  it is considered that the bread from it is a bit healthy than your typical white bread . 
  i can confirm in romania we have a lot of italians  ) . 
  all my bosses  ) ) ), 
  considering half of romania is in italy and spain i highly doubt it we will leave the country depopulated  ) . 
  soros is marking from space where the stars should appear  ) . 
  yes , but atm there is still inertia . 
  but if politicians will try to use another way to make those changes to the penal code then we will possibly have again massive protests .

   breitbart news network in light of this info i think that breitbart news network is not a fake / junk news agency but one of the 1st psychological experiments in the xix century ... 
  japan has also a dickriding festival  ), 
  this might end up with an impeachment ... 
  yep the irish catholics and the russian orthodox have joined hands  ) / s, 
  i think it is about manpower availability and funding . 
  yes . 
  and it may be that the suhoi f35 is considered better than the f18 super hornet ( also a generation 4 + air superiority ) ... 
  sick people ... 
  well the alternative would have been f22 raptors , but as far as i know , the usa aint selling those ...

  unfortunately direct democracy is the tyranny of the majority on long term . 
  by that time some bet we wont have an eu ... or it wo n't matter since we would have fiscal union .

  alpine regions of the carpathians , leontopodium alpinum cass , https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/floarea-reginei,

  making a scene in a high end restaurant about the fact that you may not like someone 's color it 's dark age material ... 
  stray cats are more ok than stray dog imo,

  african economic migrants  ), 
  the way i see it they are ready to b deployed in the mediterranean ,, 
  a lot of swearing from what i can understand polish  ), 
  i knew about the serbs , had no idea about the croats . 
  til although i am from mehedinti  ), 
  i never heard about it tbh . 
  there is a serb minority . 
  anyway i dont think they have representatives in the parliament like other minorities do . 
  no , they don ; t test . 
  they test that merchandise is not expired and usually they test stuff that are not from eu space . 
  what comes with a certificate of quality from eu is never tested unless people get sick . 
  its not even that , the price in euro is the same even if its in bucharest or berlin ... 
  are the companies private or stateowned ? 
  for us in ee it 's like a urban myth . 
  we know it cause a lot of people bring similar products from we and we compare them , but only a minority has access to this . 
  so far most governments have tried to stay out of this debate but it is ok that some have gather actual data to back this up . 
  also people who say : ur stupid do n't buy it , are cynical and ignorant , because there is no alternative and most goods even of lower quality are still of better value than what we might locally produce . 
  but this does n't hide the fact we are conned . 
  but it is , it is illegal . 
  it is marketing misleading . 
  you buy a product for the their rating , rating created in the western market , but the product is inferior . 
  but this is not smth you can see and feel mostly because there are chemical differences which affect also health on the long term or employ a higher maintenance cost ... and considering the price is the same ... it is revolting and unfair ... 
  yes but consumers do n't know ... we do n't have spectrometers at home ... everyone suspects tough ... the only one who can resolve this problem are national governments . 
  they can act legislation and fine them ... also some are still way better than what we get locally even in their inferior form . 
  since almost all are doing it from the 90s there is nothing we can do , just to buy stuff on the black market ... 
  where do we have croats ? 
  in banat ? 
  and the other one  ), 
  we will see , in the end wallonia has to approve it ... 
  they will be taxed , because the alternative is to tax the profit ( capital revenue ) ... and we all know how good the g20 administrations are at taxing profit ... 
  we kinda had some of them for 1 year and it was juuuust fine !, 
  cool salamander planing ... 
  its not telemea , its different . 
  and it has the tag feta in the hypermarket . 
   acadia the greek feta ? 
  it was a brexit wind ... 
  not again ... 
  i would n't exaggerate things but some western countries might have similar problems of corruption and i am thinking of italy for example . 
  but in the end it is the people 's choice if they think protesting it 's worth the trouble ...
