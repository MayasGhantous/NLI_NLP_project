  and fta between north west with south east without a freedom of movement is pure colonialism and i think the outcome would have been worse . 
  the problem is the humanitarian aspect of the eu regarding non eu citizens . 
  a really protectionist eu for all his citizens should maybe attack the openness of some countries like france and england towards citizens from former colonies . 
  basically limit these countries ability to import non - eu citizens . 
  i know this is crazy but it is a point of view . 
  the questions are a bit misleading since they do n't depict the whole picture . 
  otherwise the response is quite logical , given those options . 
  auch ... i did n't know about that :(, 
  as long as they have a court order ... sure why not ? 
  nop there is n't , it 's usually 1050ron + food tickets for another 200 ron . 
  happens but not for factory workers . 
  it is common in small companies like < 10 employees , some services that use different form of compensation like self employed providing service + 2h contract , also for restaurants and clubs employees , usually where this can easily fry under the radar . 
  all countries should send their firefighter air patrols and throw water above spain and portugal  ), 
  what can you guys tell me about the plane ? 
  that is another problem ... everyone promotes the great things they gave to humanity through colonialism but throws under the rug all the abuses they have done as if it never happened . 
  it might be too harsh but imo denying the negative aspects of colonialism is as bad denying holocaust . 
  ubber great , the british worker will get its wage up !, 
  yes but if you make it like : christian europe conquered and ruled africa then it does n't really matter , europeans must pay and ofc islam helps cause we are also infidels and we have to pay 2 times  ), 
  yes . 
  it would be just like crimea . 
  smoke screen for annexation . 
  shitshow of the year !, 
  well , guess poland could try to negotiate with us , some deals for lng , maybe some strategic us investors making some bids for new polish terminals . 
  nuclear is not what it used to be . 
  and as long as you are not interested in getting leftover material for nuclear weapons , then there are a lot of new designs ... green non nuclear is great , but if they do n't have high efficiency for that they should look for the only alternatives available ... 
  isnt lgn way more expensive ? 
  and the alternative would be ? 
  where do you want your gas from ? 
  why do n't they try 3rd gen nuclearor even better considering there are new designs that just do n't melt anymore and have better efficiency per fissile material it would be a shame not to try . 
  so now a + and a + + will become b ? 
  pedophile ... but i ca n't comprehend how that is possible even when drunk as fuck , which i have a lot of experience . 
  wth is that supposed to mean ? 
  eye pocking ? 
  rnm , republic of north macedonia . 
  even the gods would bow before the mighty goulash !, 
  yep so true , i share the same feeling and i 'll give you my tinhat so we wo n't be also contaminated by the soros waves . 
  where the fk was cambridge analytica when you needed them the most !, 
  definitely a [ sin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onh-ink0zzu ), 
  sorry op but i know for a fact that hungarian cuisine can do way better than this :p, 
  yes but someone who worked in french research told us that in the states he got 3 times more than in france that was the general situation . 
  i have no idea why you put romania or latvia in the equation . 
  it is good that they want to invite people work in france but they also need to pay them competitively . 
  and even now they are still making them , just that they seem a bit more modern . 
  but even if you look there is n't a lot of what you can criticize about them , since they are functional and most important is how the flats are arranged and the general material quality employed . 
  she really put an effort into that happening if you ask me . 
  note7 ? 
  well on him maybe but again 650kg hydrogen bomb would pretty much wipe istanbul from the face of the earth . 
  as bad as erdogan is he would n't deserve such a sacrifice . 
  i appreciate, 
  h ** e ** , h ** y ** ? 
  after helium comes hydrogen , but you would n't want that kind of bomb to be used ... 
  my mothers was about to die this way 5y ago . 
  she was very lucky only a bruise to the head . 
  the french, 
  odessus ( odessa ) is after tomis , not before i suspect . 
  dear uk people do n't vote for those [ insert political party ] cunts !, 
  what happens if it 's a contract on services provided on site for a specific period ? 
  i see what you did there . 
  but it 's a neet office i dig it . 
  prefer french versions but i helps since i can understand both languages . 
  ill burn there for sure !, 
  take them , get biometrics and data for each and one of them , prints , iris , dental and dna than put them in military cargo ship and send them back even by force if necessary . 
  under radar !, 
  militarize the mediterranean border , withdraw from geneva refugee convention , scrap any national law that favors immigrant family unification , start a strict surgical economic migrants recruitment process in africa , start looking for economic migrants in s america instead of mena . 
  not cuddling with u  ), 
  yes in 8y we can cuddle back together when you will have your 1st female president  ) ( not clinton ) . 
  romanians call it czechia ( cehia ) . 
  subsidies in agriculture are very important and have many reasons : 1 ) food a fundamental basic need - has to be very very cheap in the western world ( you can see that food is not taxed like other goods and services in most countries ) . 
  2 ) the subsidies program ensure a form of available cash flow when usually farmers need it the most . 
  3 ) it ensures a form of environmental farming at least in a general sense as most subsidies come with strict regulations on what to plant and where . 
  the program is indeed quite complicated but it is to make sure they do n't destroy the soil with intensive agricultural practices . 
  4 ) it ensures that small and medium farmers remain competitive as otherwise they would have the same fate as in the states where big corps dwarf them . 
  5 ) like any money scheme the effects do n't go only to farmers but also to their whole supply chain , making it easier for them to get easier access to equipment leasing for example ( since they get a sum of money they are considered to be liquid , so the financial risk is lower ) . 
  6 ) since most countries do this , it helps european farmers be competitive on international market ( although maybe questionable it is basically like a bonus for export , i think other countries also have similar schemes - heard that usa used to have a bonus system for those who export , but not sure if it is still in place ) . 
  i 've seen a lot of similar tractors at the countryside at my grandparents . 
  they work but mostly stay broken  ), 
  because of the psychological aspect . 
  dying in the bathroom or in a car accident or because of some disease is mainly inherent to our life , we got used to it , it is something that can mitigated at an individual level . 
  whereas terror attacks ca n't , at an individual level we are powerless ... 
  hence the despair , no wander they are called terror attacks . 
  je m ` en ? 
  they have both tv and radio stations . 
  the color scheme seems to be consistent with eurostat . 
   `` were poisoned to death inside a month . '', 
  is the phrasing * inside a month * commonly used ? 
  not when you have baywatch rolling in every mall :d, 
  from what i understood from my bosses ( italians ) italy has 3 problems : 1 ) corruption 2 ) fiscal evasion and 3 ) the way public funds are spent in the sense that they are spent inefficiently , there is a lot of waste . 
  / u/shiashobobeard and they are easy to track by our secret services . 
  also the majority of the small number of muslims we have are 300 + year old secular at least in romania ( dobrogea/constanta ) . 
  maybe sas should follow french special forces -  send them to syria war stage , hunt and assassinate them there as enemy combatants . 
  not to mention it 's a win win win : they die as martyrs on the battlefield and get their 72 virgins , sas gets the opportunity to train in real life warfare conditions , western streets are somehow safer ... 
  72 virgins my friend !, 
  good laugh before sleep . 
  good one op, 
  english pls :p, 
  my 1st thought was , who would throw this kind of money ? 
  chinese ? 
  seems i was right but it does n't matter as long as they do n't stick to their business model and hire only imported chinese staff . 
  1st rule never make name public . 
  2nd rule kill on sight .
