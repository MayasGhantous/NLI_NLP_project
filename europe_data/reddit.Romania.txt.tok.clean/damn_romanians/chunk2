  stick around groups of dutch people and listen to them talk . 
  it will be a pain in the ass in the first ... 3 years , but it goes away . 
  do n't know it ? 
  time to learn it tip # 3 : music and movies . 
  exactly . 
  the problem is n't with isolated immigrants , but it always becomes problematic when a bubble is created , because it gives immigrants the opportunity to be able to live without having to learn the language . 
  which , in turn , results into segregation and usually bad stuff happens . 
  freedom of movement and being a parasite in another country are 2 different things . 
  i agree to a person 's right to move and be in another country , as long as he/she can provide for him/herself through legal means . 
  whether your parents pay your study/finance your jobseeking or you work in a construction yard , it 's the same thing . 
  also , most of the fearmongering that we ( at least i ) hear is not directed towards workers , but towards potential parasites . 
  they create imbalance in the economy ( more on that later ) , tarnish the names of those who do struggle to make a decent living and are overall bad . 
  a word about imbalance : can it be that bad ? 
  the simple answer is : yes . 
  and you know what , it 's not even the handouts that are so bad , it 's another phenomenon that usually accompanies these benefit-parasites : high crime rates . 
  whether it 's them or their badly-raised kids , it 's there . 
  and what follows is that property values drop dramatically ( i saw an article about a city in germany where property prices dropped 50 % in 1.5 years , after some `` romanians '' moved in the area ) , people run away in fear , which sends a clear signal to everybody : as soon as a bunch of foreigners settles in , it 's time to get the fuck out of there . 
  i 'm romanian and i totally agree . 
  you know what ? 
  germany giving me full rights to work is one thing , i 'm happy with that . 
  people coming to germany and claiming benefits just like they were germans ? 
  ** hell no ** . 
  what did they do to earn said benefits ? 
  germans have a system in place , if you 're on benefits chances are that at least your parents worked and payed their taxes , and that 's how the system keeps rolling . 
  and then come this negative inputs , that will never ever be productive and pay back the money they received ... 
  95 % , could be better . 
  damn baltic countries , i always get them confused . 
   this is an important signal to improve the career chances for women and for greater equality in the labor market let me reiterate that last phrase :  greater equality how is that supposed to bring greater equality ? 
  shoving women into positions they might not be as competent for as some other male , because the law requires it ? 
  i sincerely see absolutely no logic whatsoever in this , and , with all the respect i have for germany and its people , must say : this law is retarded . 
  yeah , you can argue that germany is a bit of a more traditional society , where the woman is supposed to fulfill her role as a caregiver , so she 's disadvantaged in the workplace ( not sure if 100 % true , saw it in a doc ) . 
  how does this law fix it ? 
  does it address the mentality of the society ? 
  it does n't , it just sweeps the problem under the rug . 
  yeah , you can argue that women in general take paths that require less stress and risks . 
  so , in this case , why should they be granted free positions that inherently requires taking risky decisions and imply a lot of stress ? 
  finally , if all of the above premises are true , and women , disadvantaged as they are , do make it to the top , does n't that mean that they have overcome their `` disadvantages '' and should be able to do just fine by themselves , without additional support from the state ? 
  if anything , if you want to increase female participation in the workplace , start early . 
  teach little girls that it 's cool to be a nerd wasting her life in front of a computer monitor or an endless pile of charts and figures . 
  if anything , stuff like the law in question only serves to create and reinforce the opinion that women really are somehow inferior to men , and they require special assistance to be able to be competitive . 
  it 's like saying : sure , i could win this girl over by being nice to her and make her love me , but i 'm sure that if i murder her every boyfriend she will eventually turn to me because she 'll have no other choice . 
  it 's actually not that bad . 
  after reading the description , and knowing the incompetence of officials in countries like bulgaria/romania etc. , i was expecting something closer to concentration camps . 
  in comparison to their other option , this is not half-bad imo . 
  not good either , but hey , it 's the most that the country can afford . 
  you are perfectly true about that . 
  here 's the thing though : i do n't mean these small things that make a country the way it is , but rather the big things that tend to interfeer with the normal lifestyle of other people . 
  of course , you do not expect somebody to transform , but you should expect them to respect the country they are in and its people . 
  i have no problem if you 're muslim and praying in your back yard , but it starts to get a bit annoying when you want the sharia law implemented . 
  maybe danish people do n't grill that much ( i do n't know ) . 
  it would be ok if you grilled on some green space . 
  not ok when you leave a mountain of garbage behind you . 
  illegal behavior : stealing , organized crime , forcing your children to beg , prostitution etc. 
  for example , i can bet that stealing is not very danish ( although danish thieves do exist , just like in any other countries ) . 
  forcing your children to beg on the street because you 're too lazy to work is n't very danish either . 
  that 's also the point with gypsies . 
  nobody is annoyed by the fact that they 're nomads , or that they wear flowery skirts and gold earrings ( although in romania this is associated with certain kinds of people , thus in us it wakes up a strange feeling , but enough about us ) . 
  but [ when you start stealing from charity boxes and curse at the translator lady at the police station ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hprz3d3tpd8 ) , then maybe it 's time for good ol' britain to send you packing the way you came from . 
  when you go to a foreign country and [ start shitting in the middle of the street ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj3zy9_y39u ) ( warning : some of it is gross ) , you 're out . 
  what the ... 
  i ca n't even understand :|, 
   do you remember carlos fabra ? 
  the guy that built a ghost airport and won the lottery 7 times that 's one god damn lucky bastard [ / sarcasm ] . 
  between him and the guy that married two blonde fins from / u/spin0 's post , i have no idea who i 'd rather be . 
  calling you a cultural imperialist for wanting people in britain to behave british is like calling you a accomodational imperialist for not wanting your guests to move furniture around your house as they see fit . 
  about this `` cultural imperialism '' : i do believe in a united europe . 
  but i also do believe in a country 's right to a national identity and to its own culture , traditions and lifestyle . 
  so yes , you do have the right to expect people who come to britain to behave accordingly . 
  so do germans . 
  so do french . 
  so do italians etc. 
  this is not some 1940 's sh ** , it 's the way it should be . 
  why should you be forced to accept in your country a mass of people that constantly refuse to embrace its values and behave like good british people ? 
  why should anybody ? 
  i think this acceptance for acceptance 's sake is what the western world ( europe + usa ) is doing wrong right now and , in the long run , can only lead to civil unrest and internal turmoil ... 
  it 's also impossible to tell who is roma and who is n't because roma people usually do not declare themselves as roma at censuses in romania . 
  they claim it 's because of discrimination , but ofc that 's a truckload of bs , since it is n't mentioned * anywhere * on the id or passport that you 're an ethnic romani , it 's just for statistical purposes . 
  so yeah , it 's almost impossible to implement a system that can reliably tell who 's roma and who 's a tanned romanian/bulgarian , even through cooperation between the romanian and european governments . 
  this is exactly what i came here to say . 
  although i usually have to use translation websites , bijelo dugme has some songs that really hit home . 
  ako mojes , zaboravi is one of them ... 
  your username is extremely relevant to your comment , 
  we must , together , find a good solution for problem x. 
  in order to do that , our plan is to find a solution that 's not bad . 
  come'on mate , everybody knows that  ), 
  first paragraph i totally agree to . 
  a politician 's only weapon are his/her words . 
  they are masters of that . 
  force them to speak in a different language , and you strip them of their power . 
  all these subtleties that you master in your language wo n't work in another , so you risk saying something you do n't want to or do not have the power to `` twist '' the message your way . 
  also , some politicians really suck at english , even if they * think * they are good . 
  a prime example would be the temporary president of romania , crin antonescu . 
  although he had translators , he decided to take the matter in his own hands and speak english to the imf committee . 
  [ and boy did he fail ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bl-h3hvoxw ) . 
  result ? 
  he 's a running gag in romania now . 
  well , guess ... it 's something ? 
  [ a simple solution ] ( http://youtu.be/cycj69gu974?t=2m45s ) of how to extradite illegal immigrants very cheaply . 
  i do admit , the solution ** might ** need some fine tuning , as illustrated by the beginning of the clip , but overall it should work . 
  hey , we got ta start somewhere ...
