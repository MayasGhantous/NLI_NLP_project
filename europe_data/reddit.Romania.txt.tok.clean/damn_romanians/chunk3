  actually i 'd think most people do want it . 
  well , those that are n't from nations horribly affected by german actions during ww2 , like poland . 
  i could only imagine that the main reason people would n't want germany to take over is that they fear germans will make them not waste time around and actually work ... 
  otherwise , really ... hitler ? 
  wtf , are we in the 50 's ? 
  i knew that we used to use the cyrillic alphabet , but i could n't care so much about it . 
  but damn , that looks cool , we should have used that more , 
  thank you very much , i 'll take a look over it when i 'm not swamped with work , right now i have to work 12 hours per day for a school thingie ... 
  nice , thanks for the info , 
  that was n't the point . 
  when you adopt a dog , you raise it in your house . 
  releasing dogs onto the street is a misdemeanor . 
  you could call the police on the person who adopted the dog and she 'd have to pay a hefty fine . 
  the point is that these `` animal lovers '' slow the process by `` adopting '' dogs that are caught by the dog catchers , even though they know very well that they can not take care of them , and release them onto the street . 
  if you ca n't take care of them , do n't adopt . 
  it 's like those people that make 15 children and bitch about them not having anything to eat . 
  of course , they 're in deep sh * t if the dog kills a person ( like it happened with the 4year-old , the dog belonged to a ngo ) , but if it 's just a byte , meh , romanians usually do n't sew each other that much , they would rather poison the dog . 
  apparently everyone who is n't a stupid 2.5 th world country anybody can pick on . 
  and about the dna , i was just saying faking castration is a crime that is easy to get away with and yields tons of money . 
  of course , until the police decide to do a sting operation . 
  which they never do , apparently ... 
  [ or this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dxba8t7wxy ) . 
  warning : [ nsfl ] extremely graphical content , gore and stuff !, 
  do n't say you have n't been warned . 
  also , the background is some romanian newscaster announcing a death of a woman/man/child by stray dogs . 
  every time the voice changes , that 's a new case . 
  sometimes they are . 
  i 've heard a woman on the internet say : i loved the street dogs in front of my flat until they attacked and almost killed my 7 year-old daughter . 
  since them , i keep poisoning them . 
  it 's sad that this has to happen , but this is the result of authorities ' ignorance and animal lovers that keep bailing out dogs from shelters and release them on the street . 
  the dog that killed the 4 year-old belonged to a well known animal protection agency called caleidoscop . 
  they will get charged with murder , the shelters disband-ed =  even more dogs on the street . 
  same here . 
  hi5 for being a rational , smart person . 
  i think not !, 
  damn jews running the world trying to destroy romania !, 
  actually , afaik our president traian b\u0103sescu said that . 
  it would n't even matter , since the dogs can not be traced back to their mothers . 
  i mean , who will do dna testing on them . 
  romania has n't got the money for dna tests even when it comes to actual people ( there was a case of a rapist set free because the police had dna but no money to test it ) , let alone dogs . 
  also , these kind of laws are implemented everywhere in the world . 
  us , france , uk etc. 
  even freaking peta supports euthanasia . 
  but here 's the thing : if dogs be gone , ngo 's that suck money from the west and do shit with them would be gone as well . 
  sucks not being able to live on other people 's money , does n't it ? 
  you are also right . 
  the causes for this are multiple , there 's no one single cause . 
  but mostly , it 's , unfortunately , irresponsible people ... 
  `` de la dou\u0103 muncesc '' -  translation : i 'm working since 14 o'clock . 
  yeah mate , chugging counterfeit vodka is not really what we the rest call ... working . 
  it is probably tatar or ottoman . 
  i say that because also in romania in the dobrogea part ( the one just above the enclave , next to the black sea ) there are tatar people living . 
  most of them , sadly , do not speak the language anymore , that 's why it does n't register on the map . 
  but , unlike romania , bulgaria was an ottoman province until 1878 or so , so i assume many more ottomans/turkish/tatar settled there and had better privileges than in romania , thus the enclave . 
   this attitude is based on a form of anti-muslim racism  anti-muslim racism  anti-muslim * racism * good call by the germans anyway , seems that they are one of the few level-headed countries left on the continent ... 
  there 's a difference between not being good looking and not being fashionable . 
  nobody is willing to do shit to improve the standard of living of romanian people . 
  they only care about votes , and since cleaning the cities would lose them some of the votes of `` animal lovers '' , they do n't risk doing it . 
  well , it should n't be mandatory , but it is a good idea . 
  the only downside is that people hate the sound of their voices , so we might not have a lot of submissions , 
  3 issues : 1 . 
  corruption . 
  no need to explain that . 
  unfortunately for us , nobody gives a sh ** about what people want . 
  damn romanians . 
  really . 
  many people feed them , play with them because they love having a pet , but hate responsibility . 
  if your ( registered ) dog kills somebody , you go to jail . 
  if a stray kills somebody , worst thing is the dog gets put down . 
  also , there 's no need for poopie scoopies . 
  and when the dogcatchers finally arrive , some people either hide the dogs or make a huge circus , attacking the dogcatchers and preventing them to do their job . 
  animal protection agencies . 
  it should be no surprise that a lot of money is being poured into these agencies , whose goal is not to actually protect animals ( i agree with that , anybody who harms other beings for the sake of it is just a horrible human imo ) but to simply keep funneling money out of gullible `` westerners '' . 
  they see the pics , they get full of rage/sadness and donate . 
  that money gets wasted on useless pr stunts ( some representative actually had the audacity to claim * dogs are a positive factor in the life of the people of bucharest * ) , nothing gets done , more money comes , nothing gets done and the cycle repeats . 
  also , `` to gipsy yourself '' meaning : to bargain/argue in a very loud and annoying manner , usually over very trivial matters, 
  this is one of those titles where changing the order of the words really makes a difference : * romanian princess arrested for running cockring fighting *, 
  well , you do n't think they named it `` oops-ala '' for nothing , do you ? 
  [ buttscratcher salesman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbemdrn2jlm ) on a more serious note : i have no idea . 
  also , [ the origin of the colors themselves ] ( http://www.exploringromania.com/romanian-flag.html ) . 
  i like [ this ] ( http://metropotam.ro/media-albume-foto/sky-tower/sky-tower-8856422748/c7840c75460c9f2d6289e1d60f7f91a7_view.jpg ) picture in particular . 
  it shows the contrast between western-style modern houses ( bottom-right ) and communist apartment blocks ( everywhere else ) ... 
  tomorrow in world news : eastern european countries call for boycott of gorbatschov and stalinskaya vodka ... 
  or a mcdonalds flag . 
  it clearly says on ( some of ) them `` made from recycled paper '' . 
  ` bout god damn time ... 
  oh , did n't know that , thx for the info . 
  next time i 'll pay attention to that , 
  sorry , i assumed one would also read the title of the image , that states `` nuclear weapon stockpiles '' . 
  you do realize [ that was actually the americans ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/us_and_ussr_nuclear_stockpiles.png ) who started the whole thing , right ? 
  but i do agree with the rest of the comment . 
  russia is really no example of anything ... shining . 
  while being savagely beaten until you die , painted , verbally humiliated and pissed on ? 
  i can not imagine somebody who would n't die for such an experience ... 
  since some of you have posted old texts here , i ` ma up the ante with some romanian text from about 400 years ago . 
  it 's hard to properly understand even for romanians , but hell , why not ? 
   i sit on pints with sunday bread < -- ok , this * might * be a bit off  heaven ( sky ) smiles  and tells me ... luft = air . 
  erm , my best guess is :  to weapons and to ... signaled ''  to the west portuguese ...  on the seas navigate ahead  ...  ... forced war  ... human strength  ...  ... new queen , that ... sublime ( it 's the only stanza of the chorus ), 
  actually , it 's more complicated than that . 
  truth is , your statement is 100 % correct , but it 's out of context .
