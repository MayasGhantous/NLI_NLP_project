  the romanian ( and hungarian and italian ) forces defending the sides of the city were lacking in numbers ( hungarians ) and had no heavy weaponry ( and the german hq was well aware of that ) . 
  also , i 've read that the italian 's rifles were so bad that they did n't even fire unless heated on a fire for half an hour ... 
  the german high command ignored [ multiple times ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stalingrad#soviet_counter-offensives ) requests for reinforcements . 
  they refused requests from the romanian hq for permission to liquidate bridgeheads ( that were later used by the soviets during the counter-offensive ) . 
  they also ignored intel that the soviets were preparing for a counter-offensive . 
  so they kind of dug their own hole there ... 
  in romanian , there 's not a lot of pseudo-anglicisms as people just use the english word without thinking twice ( even when there 's a romanian neologism already available ) . 
  however , one that sounds like a pseudo-anglicism ( although it is n't , as the word is taken from the french `` clamer '' ) is the verb '' ( a ) clama '' . 
  it 's used by natives ( even some `` respected '' journalists who want to sound smarter ) with the meaning of '' ( to ) claim '' , because they do n't know any better . 
  what does it mean ? 
  `` to express oneself violently and with screams '' ... 
  which is ironic , because it 's exactly what i am going to do if i hear it misused one more time ... 
  i have n't heard of this ionu\u021b tene guy , but [ this ] ( http://paranoidmonkey.com/themes/default/monkeylogo.jpg ) is how i picture him after reading your comments ... 
  also , [ 700.000 soldiers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_in_world_war_ii#the_war_on_the_eastern_front ) is not really an easy to ignore figure . 
  granted , they lacked the heavy weaponry that the germans had ( tanks , anti-tank guns etc. ), 
  and the leadership kind of sucked , but the soldiers themselves were just as able as their german counterparts and way more motivated . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a big problem , but it still makes integration difficult for the subset of people who can not speak the language and for their children . 
  i think you mean child support , not alimony . 
  agree , especially seeing how the policy for receiving a visa in germany is so lenient . 
  oh , is your spouse here ? 
  sure , tag along as well . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's bad , but people should be taught to be responsible and understand that , unless you have a real reason ( like asylum ) , living in another country is not a right , but a privilege . 
  if they are willing to welcome you with open arms , help you and offer you a better life , you should offer something in return . 
  especially considering the tons of integration and language programs offered by the german government ( some of them are even free ) , it would be really rude not to try . 
  the problem is not with `` exotic '' immigrants ( e.g. 
  immigrants that come from countries where there 's not a lot of people emigrating towards germany ) , the problem is with immigrants who can easily find a numerous community that speaks their language . 
  you 'd be surprised how many of those people ca n't speak a word in german even though they 've been living there for years ( sometimes decades ) . 
  they have their average job where they speak their language , their community where they speak their language , so they are not forced to learn german . 
  so they do n't . 
  their kids will speak it , but they wo n't . 
  which i do n't think is really fair towards the german people . 
  yes . 
  when it comes to anything even remotely related to national-socialism , germans ( particularly people 30 + ) are a bit ... let 's say emotional . 
  at least that 's how it feels to me . 
  and it 's understandable , considering the collective trauma suffered by the nation in that period . 
  so , considering this , the ambassador has a very valid point . 
  in fact , i would have accepted everything written in the article if the undertone would n't have sounded to me like : `` look at these schizophrenic germans , daring to question the actions of the all-mighty freedom fighting uncle sam '' . 
  but then again , maybe i misunderstood it , maybe i 'm the weird one . 
  i do n't know a lot about germany 's recent past ( last 10-20 years ) , thus i do n't know a lot about the facts presented in the article , but i do know 1 thing : this article is * not * journalism . 
  comedy would be a better word to describe it . 
  the tone openly mocks german people , painting them as paranoid ignorants . 
  yep , i guess wanting to have a right to privacy ... that 's some paranoid sh ** right there ... 
  but where it really hits rock bottom is at the following gem :  john kornblum , a former u.s. ambassador to germany , offered this frame of reference : `` factual and unemotional are rarely used words used the characterize discussions within germany society ... '' says a man from a country where [ 6 % of the population believes in unicorns , almost 20 % believe the sun revolves around the earth , and 30 % believe cloud computing involves actual clouds ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-morford/37-percent-of-people-comp_b_2864142.html?ncid=txtlnkushpmg00000035&amp;fb_source=feed&amp;ref=feed&amp;refid=28&amp;_ft_=qid.5855130715533939402:mf_story_key.1394158023605527143 ), 
   - ... life is very hard here  - how many children do you have ? 
   - 11 that 's when i stopped watching . 
  if the church is `` involved in investments '' , just like any other company , they should pay taxes ( just like any other company ) . 
  i guess when you refrain from insults , you have to use sarcasm to back up your `` opinions '' ( i would n't even dare call them facts , since you back them up with thin air ) . 
  source that claim , and not by referencing it to hitler ( for your information , antonescu and hitler are two different persons , the latter was delusional and still believed he could win the war as the red army circled berlin , while the former knew the war was lost since 1942 ) . 
  `` millions of romanians dying '' ? 
  ** source that claim ** . 
  but it 's easier to throw words that you do not understand , like realpolitk , is it ? 
  well , [ let me give you a bit of a reality check ] ( http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/23-august-1944-salvarea-romaniei-tradare-nationala ) ( to any foreigner reading : sorry , the link 's in romanian ) . 
  so , basically , what happened is that antonescu tried to get the country out of the war with `` some '' decency . 
  he had peace talks with the western allies , that did n't go anywhere . 
  however , and this is the important part , he did manage to secure an ** armistice ** with the ussr which , apparently , was favorable to romania . 
  when did the reply arrive ? 
  23rd august . 
  if the coup had n't taken place , antonescu would have gotten the country out of the war in the best way possible ( at that time ) and without needless loss of life . 
  but that meant that king michael would have remained what he was until then : a nobody . 
  so , what does country and people-loving king do , in accord with the communists ? 
  sabotages the peace talks , refuses to notify antonescu of the positive response of the ussr and later arrests him . 
  his actions meant that we were thrown at war with both the axis and the allies for the better part of 2 months , until an official armistice [ ** which basically amounted to a surrender ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_michael's_coup#aftermath ) ( notice the difference ? ), 
  was signed . 
  130.000 romanian soldiers were sent to the gulags from which many never returned . 
  160.000 died on the western front in a war that was not ours ( [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_michael's_coup#aftermath ) ) . 
  all because king michael could n't stand being in the shadow of antonescu . 
  you want realpolitik ? 
  it was the king that was delusional enough to think the commies would allow him to rule . 
   yeah , i guess you armchair general do have the right to critic michael 's decision of leaving when the red army put a gun to his head and told him resign or be killed . 
  i 'm sure you 'd have been a much more principled person and agreed to be shot in an empty gesture . 
  first of all , i do n't think `` armchair general '' means what you think it means . 
  second of all , i have no problem with him fleeing , i would 've done the same . 
  i am a coward , and so is he . 
  but i do not lay claims as a king or a ruler . 
  i 'm a nobody , and i 'm fine with that . 
  a country should n't be led by a coward . 
  and if , after all the suffering that he 's caused to hundreds of thousands , if he has the audacity to come back and claim any rightful heritage ... 
   mad jack churchil you mean that guy who used to go to battle with a freaking claymore at his side ? 
  that guy was awesome , and did n't get nearly as much attention as he deserved , 
  first of all , i do agree with you that vlad the impaler did n't keep us from becoming a turkish province . 
  so that 's that . 
  imo , the only reason we did n't become a province is that the ottomans had no interest in wallachia becoming one , otherwise they would have had to defend it , which is not nearly as easy when you do n't have a [ big ass river ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube ) as border . 
  so they did what any intelligent empire would have done : make'em pay tribute and let the poor bastards fend for themselves . 
  however , if that were the case , and wallachia would have become a turkish province , ( and this is speculation ) could it have been the case that it would n't have been able to unite with moldavia ? 
  in that case , romania as we know it today probably would n't exist . 
  so yeah , if that 's the case , i 'd say it 's ... something . 
  ( but we need actual historians to answer that ) . 
  that or you could try to fit strippers with coin slots . 
  please do n't try to justify massacre . 
  just ... do n't . 
  the country was acting out of fear for a civil war . 
  they had no idea what was going on , except for `` they 're firing into people '' . 
  the `` leaders '' of the revolution did know it was over , and they still went through with it . 
  actually , cbr777 you 're horribly wrong on this one . 
  while i ** completely disagree ** with antonescu 's treatment of the minorities , the coup was just a shameful moment . 
  let 's be honest , the king did n't suddenly realize the suffering of the jewish population and decided to right the wrong . 
  he did what he did because he knew we were losing the war and felt an opportunity to seize power . 
  that 's just a shameful way to betray an ally , even an evil one such as nazi germany . 
  we behaved like prostitutes , and we were * rightfully * treated as such after the war . 
  antonescu had the courage to stand up and raise the fist at the ussr .
