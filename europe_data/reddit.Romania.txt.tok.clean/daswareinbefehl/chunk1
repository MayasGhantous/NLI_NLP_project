[ mr. mayor of obscure eastern european town , tear down this wall ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytydjbpbk6a ), 
  careful !, 
  one can not start a war with that attitude ... 
   we call them '' \u021b\u0103rani '' . 
  they call them `` terrone '' . 
  we will never be able to survive as a species until we find the answer to the question : `` why are some people brown ? '', 
  i hope when putin goes that it wo n't be a mad general taking over . 
  the man might not be the most democratic and liberal of leaders , but he keeps all the loonies in the kremlin in check . 
  i 'm sure russia has far worse leaders just waiting to take over the moment putin shows weakness . 
  just imagine by some unfortunate circumstance that somebody like igor strelkov comes to power . 
  it 's bulgarians this week , i see . 
  what did you expect soldiers to do when bored ? 
  solve one of the [ millennium prize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_prize_problems ) problems ? 
   closes the border , compares them to insects , makes fun of their threats , now completely forbids them to enter the country . 
  does n't serbia have visa-free travel with the eu ? 
  i suspect the number of legia warsaw fans was  20 , correct ? 
  people have short memory . 
   the only thing schengen changes for eu citizens is that you do n't have to show your id card/passport when going over the border . 
  and exports/imports move faster because trucks do n't have to do the same thing . 
  but everybody thinks of the average joe going to holiday ... 
  why cross border when so glorious russia is ? 
  only politburo allowed to cross border . 
  so i guess this simplifies our problem , a lot . 
  who said we can not lead by example ? 
  so they indirectly confirmed the war will continue until at least 2017 ... great . 
   that 's so metal brvtal \\ m /, 
   `` the people coming across the border who might or might not apply for asylum '' whatever you want to call them , my point still stands . 
  they do not respect your police . 
   the problem is that for quite some time europeans have just assumed their moral and cultural superiority . 
  i would have been downvoted into oblivion if i had n't said that . 
   i respect our policewomen and - men apparently the refugees do n't . 
   i 'm sure there were plenty of journalists around ready to snap a picture of `` racist policemen '' does n't matter . 
  that 's gon na happen anyway , the police is viewed as `` racist '' by some people in the us as well , but everybody respects them . 
  you do not push a policeman and get away with it . 
   would it politicly incorrect to call for destruction of political salafism , [ ahem ... ] ( http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2015/01/150127_wars_obamasaudijan.jpg.crop.original-original.jpg ), 
   they just shove cops away there 's your problem . 
  how could this have ever happened without them getting a senseless beating ? 
  i 'm sure the us is n't a good example in many things , but go there and touch a cop , see what happens . 
  * france has the largest population of muslims in percentage terms ( 7.5 % ) * but the image shows 13.7 for bulgaria . 
  tbh hungary is not best buddies with the majority of it 's neighbors . 
   as a bavarian i can tell you that they will absolutely make sure that not a single oktoberfest visitor will see a refugee on the street wtf ? 
  ca n't a muslim get a beer nowadays ? 
  in germany ? 
  sheeesh ... 
  pfft , he does n't even have blue eyes . 
  inferior bloodline . 
   why the fuck do we still have veto rights in un ? 
  it does n't make any sense !, 
  because not everybody is equal in the world , and thus in the un . 
  unless those migrants fleeing poverty have stem degrees and are secular . 
  then they take them . 
  it is if you 're a demagogue with a political agenda . 
  this will soon be business as usual once the `` muslamic hordes '' are behind the fence . 
  propaganda always finds an external enemy . 
   well that is if schengen is even a thing anymore . 
  letting us now into schengen would be like arriving at a party 3 minutes before the police breaks it up . 
   are we to give citizenship ? 
  most likely after 18 years of age . 
   if not will these children be send into a culture that they did not grew up in once the war is over ? 
  this will help civilizing the middle east . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/meh.ro11206.jpg ) refugees go through serbia instead . 
  it looks to me like `` polizei '' wins ... by a long shot ... 
   little more than nostalgics ? 
  to be nostalgic of something means you must have lived it . 
  most people who still can say they lived during austro hungary are dead . 
  also , erdely does not belong to you . 
  u mad ? 
   citrix xenserver which is often abbreviated to just `` xen '' in technical jargon . 
  a xen-ophobe ... dude , it 's a pun . 
  / r/european , the only place where citrix xenserver haters are tolerated . 
  except their agents they managed to infiltrate . 
  those are allah 's soldiers , sacrificing themselves by being exposed to atheism , drugs , alcohol and sexual permissiveness . 
  ok , actually assaulting a person , regardless if conscious or not should definitely be included in that statistic . 
  but verbal assault ? 
  why do n't they include looking at girls in public transport as well ? 
  or even thought assault ? 
  * you should have seen it officer , i bet he was undressing me with his eyes ... in his mind . 
   one solution could be to put the new syrian migrants to work building rejection camps for rejected asylum seekers is there any way we could outsource other manufacturing processes to those migrant camps ? 
  things that do n't need much qualification to make , yet must be produced in large numbers . 
  this would bring down costs and give us a competitive edge against china, 
   what a sausage fest . 
   the post you replied to said the pictures were cherry picked the post i replied to kept regurgitating the `` young men must go to war not be refugees '' propaganda . 
   by that metric , men are more expendable than women . 
  so equality gets suspended during war . 
  interesting perspective ... / s, 
  does sexual offence in this case include construction workers shouting at women on the street ? 
  then stop portraying young males as being more expendable than women and children / s, 
   shows more less 3/4 young men in the group yeah , all young men must die . 
  it 's their job . 
  whoever bought this article , wasted money . 
   there is a river on the border , if it will not deter the migrants from crossing into hungary they just crossed the mediterranean floating on a tractor tire . 
  nuff said . 
   they did nothing `` illegal '' yes they did . 
  disturbing the public peace . 
  that 's something which gets you arrested here and if you resist they beat you until you can not resist anymore . 
  why did n't the police just beat them ? 
  are they not allowed ? 
  you leftist neckbeards jelly yet ? 
   so we should also be able to take who we choose . 
  nike , just do it !,
