  people need to hear it . 
  what are they gon na do ? 
  bully them on ps4 ? 
  your mum jokes ? 
   we just need further co-operation . 
  perhaps a very small agency just to facilitate this in a few rooms in some brussels skyscraper .

  how many bjornsson can you find in iceland ? 
  how many of them sold weapons to isis , or even joined them ? 
   putin has said assad is non-essential . 
  he wo n't give up his access privileges to the mediterranean that easily . 
  he might say assad could go , but he will be pushing for somebody else friendly to iran and the kremlin in his place . 
   if the army is organized by the west , then it will be commanded and fighting along with the west . 
  the west is against assad . 
  but russia and iran are defending the assad regime . 
  this time it does n't look like a proxy war as it did in afghanistan and vietnam ... 
   and exactly how would they manage to come up with that single new faction ? 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  i was laying out all options on the table , waiting for an answer from somebody . 
  the last one is the most ridiculous of them all and there only for dramatic effect . 
  if they go back to syria , what army should they join ? 
  there 's 3 armies fighting each other at the moment : assad , fsa ( free syrian army ) and isis . 
   if we would stabilise syria with assads help so you are asking them to join assad 's army , many of which might have killed their friends and relatives ? 
  what makes you think once those people return to syria they wo n't rather join isis ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_hama_massacre http://endgenocide.org/conflict-areas/syria-backgrounder/, 
  fight who in syria ? 
  assad ? 
  rebels ? 
  isis ? 
  are they supposed to create another faction on their own ? 
   romania je suis [ chad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_chad ) !, 
   if ukraine is at war it ca n't join nato , so i 'm guessing that russia wants a frozen conflict . 
  out of all the foreign policy events in the last 5 years , russia seems to be winning all the time . 
  conflict is frozen . 
  just like abkhazia and transnistria . 
  focus is on isis now . 
  people can not think in parallel . 
  and some romanians too , nobody 's gon na bat an eye anyway , 
  the problem is and always will be the outer boders , not the inner ones , something these right wing , opportunistic and manipulative sociopaths leading the british press will always omit to mention . 
   has shit to do with this year 's refugee crisis . 
  unlike right wing votes . 
  i did n't know australia was bordering slovakia, 
  i would have preferred that solution as well . 
  but a covert trial . 
  with judges from serbia . 
  in a basement of an abandoned factory in belgrad . 
  at the end of the second video he says `` i want to bury you all and this is why i brought my shovel '', 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_n7ngdv0y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry5s0eaz630 i can not translate and also make sense, 
  well is n't this article a biased piece of ... writing ? 
  but who built all those highways ? 
   the benefit `` abuse '' some uk politicians are talking about primarily concern in-work benefits . 
  the uk 's favorite , tax credits , or housing benefits . 
  arguing by that logic , they could call the whole salary a `` benefit '' and then claim eu workers abuse the generous uk benefit system ...  if a uk citizen and a german citizen do the exact same work in the uk , why should only one be entitled to tax credits ? 
  if the german citizen has to pay more taxes than the uk citizen , what 's the point of the german citizen working in the uk after all ? 
  the salary difference must be immense to have economic justification and it never will be ... 
  i can see this making sense if you import people from really poor countries , where even without tax credits , the pay they will get justifies working in the uk , but this will in the end stimulate more immigration from very poor countries on low skilled jobs , not less , which is what they are telling the people they are trying to achieve . 
  if the benefits funds come from the eu , it makes sense for a person to claim them anywhere in the eu , but otherwise why is this even up for debate ? 
  do n't let people claim benefits they should n't be entitled to ... 
  but what will ? 
   like for all risk groups they can only determined by self-report . 
  then the self-report is `` wurscht '' ... especially when you must be as technically accurate as possible ( to prevent aids for example , which is what they were trying to do ) . 
  [ what 's that i did n't hear you ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djeokeg5pmq&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81 ), 
  how did they determine before , without any doubt , that a man was gay if he did n't admit it ? 
  you can not just say `` he looks and behaves a bit effeminate , he must be gay '' , you 're not going to be right in all cases . 
  there 's also gay men who play the `` man '' in the relationship , which are virtually indistinguishable from a straight man . 
  this is a very bad moment to have downtime ... 
  you will probably still be able to go . 
  it 's the romanians who they do n't like . 
  dublin will be doublin ', 
  no , i was asking what he means by `` better for the country to exit the eu '' . 
  the country in this case would be the uk . 
  there 's segments of the population who would benefit from leaving the uk , while there 's others who wo n't benefit so much . 
  `` the country '' is a vague term and does n't represent anybody . 
   it 's better for the country define `` the country '', 
   and they still do n't know what they want ... to be like wester yurop ofc, 
  he 's kinda fat ... not very good for action movies, 
  are you taking your ball with you ? 
   do n't really come close to meeting the expectations of most of those who are now arguing to leave expectation ( s ) ? 
  the most pressing concern voiced by people is immigration . 
  i doubt anybody from the general public cares/wants to know about anything else as long as `` those furners '' get sorted . 
  it 's ridiculous to the point that cameron might come out and say `` we have opted out of freedom of movement , but at the same time we must install webcams in all your bedrooms and fine you if your children can hear you having sex '' and people will accept it and vote to stay . 
  anything , no matter how ridiculous , could be accepted and made into law because it pales in comparison to the immigration issue in the eyes of the average voter .

  does it get more shallow than those 12 reasons ? 
  i think not ... 
  why not fedora ? 
   but i guess the `` go back '' is heavily implied either way . 
  let 's say he wo n't miss them very much . 
  who won ? 
  erdogan or erdogan ? 
   the only option is to build up . 
  the problem with `` building up '' is that high rise flat buildings usually turn into slums for the poor , and nobody wants that . 
  just imagine a 10-12 story building with 100 social apartments packed with people on benefits . 
   good restaurants are too expensive in paris . 
  a nice day for a picnic in the park, 
  i was expecting everybody to be at the restaurant having their prolonged lunch and wine until 16:00 when it 's time to go home,
