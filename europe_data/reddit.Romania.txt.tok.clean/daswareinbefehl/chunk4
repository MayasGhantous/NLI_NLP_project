   but anti-immigrants never listen , never learn . 
  they do not care . 
  being wrong has never stopped anybody who has an agenda ... 
  i swear i read `` illegally crossed the mediterranean each year '', 
  of course we are capable . 
  the questions are : `` is this the best solution ? '', 
  and `` do we really want to ? '', 
  i suspect they were complaining about import products , at auchan , which is french ? 
  hmmm . . interesting perspective ... 
  meanwhile macbook pro and starbucks sales jumped through the roof in most urban areas of the uk . 
  i think not !, 
   between mexico and russia . 
  so , france is an island in the pacific ? 
  the only reason finland exists is to protect russia from sweden . 
  are n't you guys between poland and hungary ? 
  why does n't the no crowd shout out `` yes bias ! '', 
  i guess they would have a slight advantage if the question were put : `` do you want to leave the european union ? '', 
  what do yes and no mean in this context ? 
  yes we want to stay or yes we want to leave ? 
  see , we have 2 . 
  one is real , one is copy . 
  who 's stronk now ? 
  holy shit , they 're the same everywhere !, 
  military police in slovakia wear balaclavas too !, 
  they had to sneak that `` muslim '' in the title , had n't they ? 
  wonder if they would have tried the same move on klitschko . 
  he 's ukrainian and therefore `` discriminable while drunk in a night bus '' ... rite guys ? 
   so , lots of tracksuits ? 
  and very strong leg muscles from all that squatting . 
  why do n't they grow them for meat ? 
  [ \u2256 _ \u2256 ] ( http://reactionface.net/reactionface/images/original/1182.jpg?new=1 ), 
  but the irish say it 's their economy growing the fastest , and the poles claim it 's theirs while estonians keep contradicting everybody no no no , it 's us, 
  if ttip is so secret , how come you know what they do in that special room ? 
  looks like russia could use another partner in the middle east ... 
  if the historic pattern were to be respected , we are up for an invasion/occupation/cataclysm pretty soon , we are doing too good . 
  at this rate we 'll be `` ok '' - ish in 50 years . 
  who 's it gon na be this time , the romans , the turks , the russians , the austro-hungarians ? 
   it 's quite easy , at least basic flying . 
  do you have many high buildings in sweden ? 
   it 's looks too damn complicated . 
  at least for me . 
  nobody knows what any button on that dash does . 
  most people can barely handle a car with 5 speeds ... 
   it would probably bankrupt us , and cause literally everybody in the world to invade us before we finish it . 
  only the big boys are allowed to have nukes . 
  then put it in the job requirements . 
  have hr screen people that are not fluent out , over the phone . 
  it should n't take more than 5 minutes/applicant . 
   the jas looks the comfiest . 
  seat and other ergonomics are designed by ikea, 
   ah a retrofitted mig you can put an ipad in it if you have an angle grinder and a drill . 
  pffft ... analog dials make you value your life more and are more dramatic when they start spinning around erratically [ mig 21 lancer `` flying coffin '' we still use ] ( http://data.primeportal.net/hangar/luc_colin/lancer_c/lancer%20c%20029_2.jpg ), 
  but who gets drafted and on which criteria ? 
  are n't these young men supposed to be draft dodging and not go to hipster shops , where they can be arrested ? 
  how is the actual military draft process in ukraine right now ? 
  only `` some '' young men are drafted ( who probably are unfortunate enough to not be rich ) or all of them ? 
  ahem . 
  bbbut we want 20hr weeks with full pay !, 
  now corbyn is sure to win !, 
  but putinbots get vpns . 
  why is your flag in inverted colors , iceland ? 
   how could they mix up italians and brits ? 
  no , ca n't you see he 's from the [ ivory coast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_ivory_coast ) ? 
  because it seems like a better tourist package to me . 
  i do n't know about actually living in those cities though , the one with the cheapest rent and most job opportunities would win . 
  nope . 
  i want to buy alfa romeo . 
  therefore i work your job .

  most right wingers are also conspiracy theorists , and having such a statement from one of the bilderbergs will surely make them shout brexit even louder, 
  why do n't they try invading russia as well ? 
  in winter ... 
  i wonder what kind of network do they use to transfer the money ? 
  i suspect ing homebanking or western union is n't secure enough ... 
  what if they claim benefits and multiply like crazy ? 
   polish man , `` i do n't believe it , them coming over here , unskilled workers . 
  they took my job from right under me . 
  this is my country , british jobs for polish people is what i say . '', 
   actually , some of this is true . 
  ask a polish man what he thinks about romanians . 
  especially if he 's drunk . 
   at the rate we 're going here , we 're gon na need a special eu-fund for unemployed graphic designers . 
  or kickstarter projects to buy the latest macbook pro . 
  how am i supposed to be creative at starbucks if forced to write nonsense on my blog using a lenovo ? 
   uk has long wanted to restrict it . 
    sounds like a win-win for everyone . 
   you wo n't get your old steel factory job back , grandpa . 
  if it 's not eastern europeans it will be bloody automation . 
   seriously , nothing good can come from allowing these imams to spew their shit . 
  idiots visiting the imam have friends , which are possibly not that idiotic , and wo n't visit the imam and shout out their plans to kill the infidels , even though they are radical islamists . 
  you now have a vague lead to a network of `` possible jihadist suspects '' you would n't have had if you did n't allow the imam to spew his bullshit in the open . 
  what i 'm trying to say is : * if you visit the imam , all your family and everybody you know is on the terrorist watch list . 
  * if you monitor them and keep everything under control ( which did n't happen unfortunately , even though the police had various red flags about the kouachi brothers in the past ) things would be much easier . 
  it 's like this : you wan na find drug dealers ? 
  go to a rave party . 
  after you go through the odd consumer and street hustler you will eventually find a lead to one of the `` big fish '' drug lords actually importing that shit . 
  everybody leaves traces , you just need to know where to look, 
   you let them create hundreds more ? 
  hundreds more you know about and can arrest any time is better than 10s you do n't know about .
