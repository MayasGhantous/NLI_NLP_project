  they 're overpriced as fuck , and crowded beyond belief , it 's like drinking moonshine in the middle of a herd of goats while burning money . 
  as much as i 'd like to say yes , probably no , because hungary would start getting all touchy-feely with us . 
  also , because likely our capital would be cluj and i hate that city from the bottom of my soul . 
  well , sometimes dubbing can be pretty cool . 
  for example in hungarian , the flintstones was dubbed in such a way that the characters spoke exclusively in rhymes . 
  and if you ask me , that added value to it , rather than subtracted from it . 
  consider this : sure you do n't learn english , but you vastly improve your vocabulary . 
   3 countries oppose new sanctions , hungary , slovakia and cyprus . 
  not sure about the latter two , but hungary has been playing buddy-buddy with russia for a while now , with [ one of their meps turning out to be a russian shill ] ( http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124156 ) and orban getting abit too close to putin . 
  is '56 really that far behind , or is orban really that desperate for a friend after he turned his back on europe and european values ? 
  the pipeline will work under full load only 2 years later , so there 's that . 
  right now it 's more of a symbolic thing . 
  also , we 'll export more electricity to moldova . 
  yeah , saw that too . 
  shit sucks , though i 've come to peace with the idea that romania might soon get a new neighbour . 
  i mean , if they 're all the way to odessa , whats it to them if they occupy a few more kilometers of shoreline ** and ** carve a path to transnistria as well . 
   americans are hiding gigantic caves with alien pyramids in bulgaria [ oh wow , you guys too ? 
  ] ( https://translate.google.ro/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.efemeride.ro%2fbaza-extraterestra-din-muntii-bucegi&amp;edit-text= ), 
  nato dissolved ? 
  ukraine written off ? 
  well , the 4 regions essential to offering a strip of land to crimea are , since the russian cat is now quite clearly out of the bag and around donetsk . 
  [ sobieski ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/vodka_sobieski.jpg/640px-vodka_sobieski.jpg ) or gtfo !, 
   poppy noodles maybe that used to be an imperial thing , but it 's eaten all over eastern europe . 
  a great milestone , but the justice system should not rest on the laurels just yet . 
  there 's plenty more to be done ; but plenty more where this came from as well . 
  let us also get klaus iohannis as president , and this year will be one for the history books as the day romania started taking shit seriously . 
  yes please . 
  [ my hometown stronker than bucharest !, 
  strong as vienna !, 
  let 's see : ** lukoil ** : money goes to russia . 
  ** gazprom ** : money goes to russia and then into ukraine in the form of a separatist btr . 
  ** mol ** : money goes to hungary and then to orb\u00e1n who uses it to set up a fascist state . 
  ** omv/petrom ** : money goes to austria and then into the bank accounts of shardeholders hosted by the black hole in the middle of the eu that goes by the name of switzerland never to be seen again . 
  ** rompetrol ** : money goes to kazakhstan and the making of borat 2 . 
  * sigh * i guess i wanted to know what borat did after he returned from america ... 
  poland can not into poll-land ; you forgot poland ; etc. 
  any sort of tie with russia will reflect quite strongly . 
  the civil war is actually helping out on your image . 
  unless you 're moldova , in which case you 'll be kawaii as fuck even if in reality you 're quite frankly a shithole . 
  you can thank football and the need for uneducated laborers . 
  extremely negative because bad weather . 
  nah , not really . 
  sweden and denmark would probably be rated even higher than germany . 
  that 's why i fill up at mol . 
  god damn it , i realized now i 'm funding the hungarian government to nag me over a hundred-year-old piece of clay . 
  and a sample of 1,400 is going to speak for 18,000,000 ? 
  a proper referendum is the only way to effectively gauge opinion on the matter . 
  and then we can throw half those votes away , since they 're from poorly informed twats who will put national pride before the country 's economy . 
  they 'll show it with a few years delay . 
  moscow needs time to ... er ... analyze the evidence . 
   a bit more russificated a bit too much . 
   the romanians have constantly been overwhelmingly in favor erm , no . 
  that fact that we have a very vocal community of 15 year olds with right wing tendencies spraying `` basarabia e rom\u00e2nia '' graffitti on every inch of open wall does not mean the majority is okay with it , precisely because of :  money . 
  it will cost a lot to integrate moldova in romania , we 'd probably need some eu funding special for moldova . 
  gdp per capita ppp ( world bank ) , romania : $ 18,635 | moldova $ 4,669 and because cultural differences . 
  soviet occupation ensured they stayed way behind and the rural community is still unfit to join the urban masses - picture romanian '' \u021b\u0103rani de ora\u0219 '' x5 , minus the manele . 
  basically , russian vatniks and gopniks . 
  i think it was mentioned somewhere that they had to fly further north to avoid bad weather in the south . 
  not sure what the weather was like yesterday , but assuming it has n't changed dramatically , you 'll notice a corridor of clear skies just around the donetsk region . 
  ninja edit : spelling, 
  untrained ? 
  maybe . 
  but considering some of the sepratists do have some degree of military experience , not to mention the prospect of russian specialists possibly present , i 'd say it 's pretty clear it was n't shot down by trained ukranian military . 
  they 're still perfectly fine rocket artillery pieces . 
  not precise , but effective for covering a large areas as well as inducing panic . 
  get out of here , everyone knows blue and raspberries is the way to go !, 
  nah , that would imply it keeps coming back . 
  thing is , bor never leaves . 
  the romanian orthodox church is like a cockroach . 
  no matter what , they find a way to suck up and continue their existence and maintain their presence , rather forcefuly in public life . 
  state atheism was never really a thing . 
  also , for some , hard times are proof of god 's inexistence , for others , it 's the contrary . 
  i guess most of romania fits into the second category . 
  edit : also , the anthem has a verse mentioning `` priests lead with crucifixes , for this army is christian '' . 
  so yeah , it is fairly embedded in romanian culture . 
  i do n't know , is continually asking for evidence when presented with said evidence proof that they 're pro-russian ? 
  back during the crimea days , there were [ clear pictures of vdv troops , in vdv camo , in gaz tigr transports used only by russians , with russian military number plates ] ( http://ost-front.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/qxsbqz8.jpg ) , and you could recognize these guys because they were all like `` but you do n't have any evidence they 're russians '' . 
  no , having unique camouflage to the vdv , and vehicles used only by the russian armed forces , clearly labeled with rus , is in no way proof that they 're russian . 
  just a bunch of airsofters who happen to play wargames pretending to be russians . 
  even if you 'll confront them with proof of russian media faking reports / images ( check [ 1 ] ( http://www.examiner.com/list/russia-s-top-20-lies-about-ukraine ) | [ 2 ] ( http://www.examiner.com/list/russia-s-top-40-lies-about-ukraine ) | [ 3 ] ( http://www.examiner.com/list/russia-s-top-60-lies-about-ukraine ) ) they 'll just ignore it and keep paroting that the western media is lying and that they 're in bed with the ukranian fascist junta . 
  just check the comments of the aforementioned articles . 
  a bunch of them are defending the `` honest , trustowrthy and totally independent '' russian press . 
  same with people continuously denying there are russian unmarked t-64s present in ukraine , [ despite there being a nato report giving conflusive proof of it ] ( http://aco.nato.int/statement-on-russian-main-battle-tanks.aspx ) , and at least two videos ( [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q977zu2j1ww ) | [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loxdoa3ckw0 ) ) in which they are clearly trailing behind a truck flying the russian flag . 
  but no , totally no russian involvement and we 're just average redditors , and our streak of pro-russian shitposts just happens to be a coincidence . 
  worldnews and ukraineconflict are places you 'll like to visit if you want to get cancer from the sheer bluntness of pro-russian shilling . 
  rest assured , there are plenty of russian shills/astroturfers on r/worldndews , as well as r/ukranianconflict and other subreddits . 
  they 're catching up to modern ways , i 'm afraid . 
  well , you have to wait for the kid to grow up until you can teach them english and german , give them alcohol and shove a potato down its throat . 
  considering those are pretty much mandatory speak danish , them kids are geniuses . 
  swiss hate cars anyway , and pretty much anything that is n't swiss . 
  it 's common sense . 
  sadly for them it 's quite real . 
  it 's not really as bad for us , though . 
  we export low-life crooks and get eu moniez , while at the same time having the eu look over us as we attempt to get rid of the bigger fish . 
  best agreement we 've ever signed . 
  i 'm not sure if encouraging monopoly is a good thing . 
  but as long as we 're behind the american and israeli companies , let ` er rip ... or merge . 
  [ french tried doing that already ] ( http://www.heberger-image.fr/data/images/95286_amx_40.jpeg ) . 
  of course it was never produced , since it was too heavily armored and could actually stick around in battle due to its low speed , instead of retreating to safety whenver the enemy showed up . 
   putin 's annexation of crimea was the best thing that a country leader could possibly do he 's trying to consolidate power at home .
