  not to mention there were also reports of russia providing air support for the rebels . 
  * sigh * i for one welcome our born-again soviet masters . 
  cold war 2 : electric boogaloo when ? 
  well , that 's one way of paying debts . 
  yeah , but not under hungarian influence . 
  let me guess , your parents and/or grandparents kept the packaging or cans . 
  never thought hungary would be on top of some dutch tourists ' lists . 
  i mean , what is so out-of-the ordinary ? 
  maybe it 's just me being so accustomed to it speaking , but it 's literally a bunch of forts and a lake in a giant empty field , with what is arguably some of the best cuisine in eastern europe . 
  never was a big fan of football . 
  i 'll just probably watch the final with some of my football-loving friends . 
  meanwhile i 'll avoid all pubs that show football . 
  oh come on , it 's not like the 90s were n't filled with songs like that . 
  heard of [ e-rotic ( kinda nsfw ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9lpgwsg-as ) ? 
  just because the government workers are doing better , does n't mean the rest of the country is . 
  salaries staying still on the private market , unemployment still unchanged , but all the meanwhile we get a shitton of extra taxes and raised tarriffs to deal with . 
  edit : and yes , i 'm gon na bring up the tarriffs for fuel and the `` taxa pe st\u00e2lp '' . 
   unemployment is falling , salaries seem to be going up u wot m8 ? 
  if anything , it 's worse than before the ponta cabinet . 
  ca n't you guys just hold the referendum already and make the result official ? 
  years of * `` oh , it 's coming '' * ; * `` we 're definitely doing it now '' * ; * `` referendom soon \u2122 '' * make uk euroskeptics seem like a less dramatic north korea . 
  or are they not doing it because they know the majority will vote to stay ? 
  rip in peace , american east coast . 
  on the plus side , at least the a2 highway wo n't be blocked by people from bucharest going to the seaside . 
  bucharest will be the seaside !, 
   they are richer , have more resources , and are second-rank citizens with this new government sounds like communism \u00e1 la carte to me . 
  why is n't putin helping the new government ? 
  shhh , romania never did anything bad , it was only a victim , now keep playing your role ... 1940 nevar 4get ip !, 
   have you ever seen putin wear hair ? 
  ftfy, 
  just a few off the top of my head : [ voice of russia ( french edition ) - romania has territorial interests in ukraine ] ( http://french.ruvr.ru/2014_04_22/les-interets-roumains-en-ukraine-5886/ ) [ voice of russia ( english edition ) - romanian military moving towards ukrainian border ] ( http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_04_27/romanian-military-units-moving-towards-ukrainian-border-2722/ ) [ rossiya 1 report on romania ( the one about the eu causing more bad than good ) ( russian ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8jo4itgtzs ) [ rossiya 1 report 2 on romania ( romanians are warmongers etc. ), 
  ( russian ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldt9wdko_bk ) [ adev\u0103rul article ( romanian ) - russia engaged in stupendous propaganda against romania ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/eveniment/rusia-declansat-propaganda-stupida-romaniei-1_535d40a50d133766a8244db6/index.html ) [ adev\u0103rul article ( romanian ) - voice of russia strikes again : romania ca n't hold off for more than 30 minutes in case of war ] ( http://adevarul.ro/international/europa/vocea-rusiei-loveste-nou-romania-nu-rezista-mai-30-minute-fata-unui-razboi-1_5363289f0d133766a8486395/index.html ) [ 2013 declaration re-examined ( romanian ) , about russia 's concerns of u.s. nuclear devices placed at missile shield battery locations ( incl . 
  that 's what russian propaganda says . 
  they 're trustworthy , r-right guys ? 
  it 's not like they 're staging a massive exodus since ' 07 . 
  cv9035-nl , to be more precise . 
  ifvs . 
  while i agree with certain points you make , however , it must be said that things were pretty shitty compared to most western countries , every since the end of ww2 . 
  and what has been recovered during communism was lost after ' 89 . 
  it took over 10 years for our gdp to climb back to its '89 value . 
  the union has hardly had the massive negative impact . 
  if anything , it was greatly positive , but things like brain drain are definitely an unwanted side effect . 
  but gypsies becoming a growing problem ever since ' 07 , as they claimed ? 
  bitch please , if anything we 're weeding out the lazy of the lower class ( incl . 
  gypsies ) , with their dream of living a better life in the west . 
  unemployment has went down not just because of foreign investment , but because people who were jobless by choice thought that moving westward would magically make life better for them . 
  as far as the political landscape looking bleak - that 's precisely the fault of , us , the people and our indifference . 
  it 's sad to know the majority are completely uninformed and will most likely vote for whoever gives them a rusty bucket , or for whoever looks most handsome . 
  not to mention certain parties having certain regions in a chokehold through `` local barons '' . 
  it 's bad , but uninvolvement in the political scene will not make it change . 
  and i still beg to differ about the 30 minute thing . 
  as long as there 's even one man putting up a fight , we 're not out of the fight . 
  but yes , it 's stupidly optimistic for us to expect to hold off any russian attack for any significant amount of time . 
  conventionally , without outside support , we 'd hold up a week , tops . 
  while i am scared , and i believe plenty of people share the same feeling , there 's no need to be negative . 
  if anything , now , in the face of adversity we have to prove that for once we can leave our stupid `` caterinc\u0103 '' aside and do something . 
  also apparently we have more gypsies since joining the eu . 
  except now , we 're bombared with a greater volume of propaganda than ever . 
  and preparations for military draft ? 
  that 's unprecedented . 
  sure , we did have a draft , but preparations for war ? 
  indeed , there was a joint training excercise on the 29th . 
  looks fairly dutch to me .

  this was from mid march , in preparation for the excercise , but yes , dutch are present , being participants at v\u00e1rpalota challenge 2014 . 
  edit : sources for pics . 
  minus the fact that protests trigger a goddamn proxy war between the west and the east . 
  i think it started last year with the person chosen to represent the people failing at doing so . 
  russia has been spreading propaganda against romania for a while now . 
  saying joining the eu was devastating for romania , being the main cause of poverty and many more things . 
  yesterday they claimed we have us ballistic nuclear missiles at deveselu ( location of the nato missile shield battery ) . 
  today propaganda by the voice of russia claimed romania could n't withstand more than 30 minutes in case of war . 
  meanwhile wthe romanian parliament is preparing documentation in perparation for military drafting in case of mobilization or war . 
  a train carrying equipment and a military convoy were spotted on the move . 
  canadians and us marines in romania are on the ready . 
  across the border , in hungary , us , dutch and hungarian troops are also making preparations and hauling equipment . 
  i may live in the westernmost area of romania , but i 'm definitely concerned . 
  should russia attack i will not hesitate to resist , be it by enlisting or otherwise ; not because i 'd be a patriot , but because i despise russia , as should everyone else , given their recent aggression . 
  further edit : my friends and i have been studying military equipment from all sides ever since the crimean standoff , so we would be at the very least familiar with their operation , if push ever comes to shove . 
   they camp out in the woods around oslo holy shit , you even uplift the gypsies and somehow make them humanly camp in the woods instead of building shanties inside of town . 
  all hail norway !, 
   how bad is the situation there ? 
  from my own experience : thefts , beatings , that sort of stuff are n't uncommon in areas with high roma populations . 
  same as here . 
  miskolc comes to mind as a relatively troubled area . 
  though , i doubt there are any significant differences in crime rates between the east and say , the budapest area . 
  however , the situation seemed much worse to me in southern/southwestern hungary in the balaton area , and further south , around kaposvar . 
  actually , yes . 
  remember that vw polo + tv bribe package for the former road authority chief from last week ? 
  remember how ridiculously stupid that was ? 
  well fret not , we have stooped even lower !, 
  [ a judge got bribed with some trout , whiskey and a cuckoo clock !, 
  it 's not unlike any regular telecom service . 
  in this day and age , do you really believe you can still be off the grid after you 've made contact with it even once ? 
  but in romanian it 's `` arond '' which roughly translates into `` round a '' . 
  never heard of anything related to monkeys ? 
  this argument has been posted a million times . 
  short answer : because you wanted us in your zone of influence . 
  being a superpower has its price . 
  realistically , though , we 're well-aware we 're just another buffer state and if attacked we 'll probably fall without any of nato even lifting a finger .
