  ever thought of going into the kitchen and having a dick sandwich instead of posting that ? 
   not entirely , no . 
  your assumption that yanuk is somehow representative of `` the left '' is derived from your belief that his opponents are from `` the right '' . 
  do you seriously think there are no leftists on the maidan ? 
  no centrists ? 
  no liberals ? 
  you 're assuming i do n't know about other protesters . 
  i already stated a million times in this thread , nobody gives a flying fuck about those who protest peacefully a.k.a. 
  those who are n't svoboda or right sector . 
  but hey , if someone identifies as a liberal and yet fights alongside them is an idiot and might as well get shot . 
  those protesting against yan 's policies are long gone . 
  those left are merely people who wish the violence to continue - the people that charged into independence square as soon as the police left after the truce . 
  way to help the credibility of the protests , breaking the truce as soon as it 's announced , eh ? 
  the problem are the right wing fucks that are willing to send the country to the depths of hell so they can gain some power . 
  and yes , yan 's a left-centrist . 
  it 's difficult to assign him to a specific `` wing '' as even his party is all over the fucking place . 
  they identify as center-left . 
  center-left they are then . 
  but you 've completely still missed the point either way . 
  svoboda must not be allowed to seize any sort of power . 
  that is their goal . 
  that is the goal of the violence right now . 
  destabilize , then assume control . 
  the government sure loves drinking molotovs , then . 
  that minority is n't the only one fighting . 
  it 's leading the fights . 
  everyone fighting is a legit target . 
  period . 
  left/centrist . 
  there , happy now ? 
  oh i 'm , sorry , so [ in this video ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b36_1391163762 ) , i 'm not actually seeing svoboda members ( who alongside the right sector are currently leading the violent clashes ) wearing nazi uniforms and performing nazi saultes ? 
  i agree with this point , but it 's no longer about that . 
  it 's clear the original reason for protesting has been long lost . 
  now they wish to overthrow the government . 
  swap one list of worthless animals for another . 
  things wo n't change and they 're only ruining their country with the destructive protests . 
  no , what they 're doing is pacifying responsible adults who suffer the consequences of their direct or indirect support of violent actions . 
   a government that commands the police to open fire on the citizens why are you taking things out of context ? 
  the police are merely pacifying violent protesters . 
  it 's the protester 's choice to become violent , and that means they 'll accept the consequences of their actions as responsible adults , mais non ? 
  and i keep bringing up occupy , because westerners believe it 's pretty much the same shit . 
  ever sicne occupy , regardless of reasons , until they were utterly swarmed by evidence that they were wrong , westerners blindly supported all protests and riots against governments , regardless of who led them . 
  they thought it 's the same thing : average people `` sticking it to the man '' and crying for freedom . 
  it 's not . 
  occupy was a movement against corporatism . 
  this has turned into a movement against stability and peace . 
  it 's no longer a pro-eu protest . 
  when certain people , doing nazi salutes , wearing nazi uniforms , openly admitting they are neo-nazis , such as svoboda members , are fighting ? 
  that 's hardly legitimate . 
   titushki so called `` thugs for hire '' as the media calls them ? 
  they hardly did anything other than stand in front of police barricades to keep the violent protesters away . 
  the pro-eu protesters are either long gone or at the rear , but they 're most likely not part of the violence . 
  if they are , and they 're fighting alongside the fascists , all the more reason to stand against this revolt . 
  no , what we 're seeing is evidence of [ protesters assaulting government institutions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/afmvpnj.jpg ) and [ policemen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e6zzvwo.jpg ) , in which case the police has 100 % legitimacy to respond with force . 
  we have fucking video of protesters charging with shields . 
  we have videos of protesters shooting guns . 
  we have conclusive evidence the violence is being led by svoboda and right sector . 
  and yet we still support protesters ? 
   we need a strong ukraine that upholds human rights , free speech and so on switching left wing for right wing wo n't be such a happy ending . 
   i 've got relatives in ukraine i do n't . 
  but it 's a neighbouring country . 
  and it 's extremely unstable . 
   ukraine being thrown into the russian sphere of influence might have dire reprecussions on the region because throwing them into the american sphere of influence will be better ? 
   i want a similar revolution home , so that we can throw out all the fuck face politicians out of their comfy seats and villas . 
  to replace them with whom ? 
  time things will end up worse than before . 
  you 'll get ridden by the opposition and when they gain power they 'll do the exact same thing . 
  except this is n't bullshit read on reddit . 
  this is what 's going on . 
  the proof is fucking there . 
  everywhere you look you see images of protesters with guns , moltovs overruning and vandalizing government institutions and the police in a defensive position shooting in self-defense . 
  this is hardly a legit protest . 
  yes , but some governments are doing it for the right reasons . 
  see egypt , libya , syria ? 
  they 're all in deep shit because the protesters were in fact islamic extremists . 
  were the lessons not learned ? 
  now ukraine is in deep shit because the protesters are right-wing extremists . 
  the opposite was during the occupy movement , particularly in the united states , where the people were actually peaceful and the government acted with unwarranted force . 
  yes they have , but remember media manipulation . 
  western media is trying really hard to portray the protesters as the good guys . 
  in reality , neither side is good . 
  eagle . 
  they 're the equivalent of u.s. swat forces . 
   dont they see that there is an opportunity for them to take part in a movement wich will help ukraine if it succeed ? 
  sure , the fascists of svoboda and right sector can help ukraine . 
  they can help ukraine and everyone else in the region . 
  eastern europe 's stability can only increase with the right-wing gaining power !, 
  because they systematically attack government institutions and police forces . 
   american/western european website full of teenagers . 
  which also explains blind support for the protesters . 
  oh no , but that really ** was ** the police shooting protesters . 
  protesters who are up to doing things like [ assaulting government buildings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/afmvpnj.jpg ) or [ destroying public property to use as ammo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pzwkw6h.jpg ) and [ throwing molotovs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fvulryd.jpg ) at [ police forces ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e6zzvwo.jpg ) who are actually [ on the defensive ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ide4fjq.jpg ) for the past month or so . 
  violence begets violence , and as long as the protesters keep being unlawful , they will , and ** should ** be met with force . 
  and this is how media manipulation works . 
  and it works both ways you know . 
  the death of some protesters is not an acceptable reason to blindly support the right wing . 
  fuck no !, 
  i was saying the same thing before right wing involvement . 
  you know , when pro-eu protesters took to the streets with banners and signs . 
  then came the anti-government protesters .
