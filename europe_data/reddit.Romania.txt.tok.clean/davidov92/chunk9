  i like to think that we live by the `` if it is n't broken , do n't fix it ( or buy a new one ) '' rule , but our prime-minister kinda disproves that . 
  road trip ? 
  god no . 
  if you wo n't die on your way to bucharest on romanian roads during winter , you will die in bucharest traffic . 
  i 'd suggest the train , but you 'd die of old age before you 'd get to bucharest . 
  next up i 'd suggest taking a plane , but i 'm afraid of what taxi drivers might do to you once you get out of the airport . 
  actually that makes sense . 
  at least from the point of view of parking . 
  at least 1 out of 5 people has a car . 
  the building creates a zone of high human density . 
  the building most likely does n't have a proper parking facility since this is romania and that 's part of where the costs are cut . 
  romanians outright lack the common sense to park anywhere else other than exactly where they have business . 
  the result would be cars parking on the inside lane in front of the building , in addition to the sidewalk and outside lane . 
  yes , the situation is that bad . 
   croatia : always double the number on the speed limit sign or you will be honked at . 
  especially on the road down the coast . 
  yes , but by austrians . 
  i 've spent a full month in croatia this summer , and not once was i honked at by croatians . 
  it 's always austrians in a fancy bmw or an audi doing 100 in the city or 200 on the highway . 
  and this works in austria , too . 
  where 's the friggin ' rush ? 
  austrian drivers are like romanian drivers 2.0 : obsessed with speed and bmws . 
  so , serious diseases and other afflictions are not grounds for abortion ? 
  ok , ** now ** it 's stupid as hell . 
  except this ** is ** grounds for abortion . 
  what if i told you there are numerous other contraceptive methods ? 
  good , so if they do n't want it , why do they do it in the first place ? 
  ok , can someone explain how this is even remotely a bad thing ? 
  if you ca n't sustain a kid , do n't make one . 
  there 's plenty you can do to prevent it . 
  or is reddit against it purely because the average redditor is a libtard ? 
  there 's nothing philosophical about it . 
  when i was out protesting against acta a couple of years ago with my friends , we felt cold , went into a pub and had some mulled wine . 
  then we went back . 
  if someone would 've taken a picture of us when we were in the pub , it would 've looked just like this picture . 
  interpret the image and its composition any way you want , but do n't claim it 's 2 separate worlds . 
  even if they were n't actively protesting before or after the picture , do you think they 're a-ok with how things are going ? 
  do n't you think many of the gendarmes would actually prefer to be on the other side of the barricade ? 
  you know , protesters are n't that different from your average human beings , and as shocking as it may seem they also visit coffee shops to have a drink once in a while . 
  media manipulation works for both sides , you know . 
  wow , this is not good . 
  europe 's gon na be deserted in a couple of decades . 
  i think you might as well ... fuck it . 
  hungarian is quite common in transylvania ( and , surprisingly , to a smaller scale in bucharest ) , and both ethnicities can at the very least mutter a few words in the other language , yes . 
  unfortunately this is becoming a decreasing phenomenon due to right-wing agitators and general morons on both sides . 
  romance languages like french , spanish and italian are also widely spoken . 
  edit : oh and yes , italian does sound like romanian with all the slavic parts cut out . 
  nor are german folk a common sight anymore . 
  most have left in 1918 , and then 1989 . 
  yeah , right . 
  except for that fact that they seem to ruin absolutely everything they touch . 
  the good ones are already on this side of the pruth . 
  i 've been there and i 've seen what kind of people they are . 
  let 's just say they put greeks and italians to shame . 
  too good of a deal ? 
  maybe . 
  still going downhill due to unchecked political struggles and hubris ? 
  definitely . 
  i honestly wish you will . 
  not to insult moldovans , but they 're nowhere near as fit as ukraine is . 
  allowing moldova to join anytime soon ( e.g. 
  within 20 years ) would be a greater economic tragedy for the union than 10 ukraines . 
   becoming a member of the eu ensures greater political stability and accountability , since the leaders of the country will now also have to answer to the european union . 
  in civilized countries , maybe . 
  romania and hungary are being killed from the inside and nobody within the union is taking any measures . 
  as citizen of both , i honestly wish the eu was the great dictatorial merkelreich the french and brits describe . 
  maybe then these countries would n't be such great shitholes . 
  i honestly do n't know , because it has traits present in both aircraft . 
  i was just more inclinded to believe it was a poorly drawn 29 , because of the copious amounts of soviet stuff around it . 
  so , not doing what the u.s. is doing to pound itself into the dirt is a bad thing now ? 
  what happens in the u.s. should very much stay in the u.s. poland , or europe for that matter does n't have an economy built around wars , coups and the continued strength of the petrodollar . 
  and there is absolutely no bigger mistake than saying politicians funded by goverment money are compromised . 
  they get compromised the moment individuals and/or lobby groups fund them . 
  and from there it all snowballs into corporate dominance . 
  because `` hey , why vote for the unpopular opinion to watch it fail , when you can outright buy it ? '' . 
  if it were n't for obligatory to remain politically correct on reddit , i 'd say pretty much what sort of propaganda that is , and who would benefit from the actions mentioned by that guy . 
  but i ca n't ... so i 'll just call it wall street happy merchant propaganda . 
  til the mig-29 was invented a few decades earlier and actually got launched into space alongside the sputnik . 
  the more you know ... 
  i am not . 
  it may not seem so , but poland is the only country not to lose due to recession , but actually grow . 
  you may not perceive the improvement . 
  us eastern europeans in general do n't perceive improvement ( commie times left us fairly cynical regarding ... everything ) but it 's definitely there . 
  things are getting better . 
  one step at a time . 
  please continue . 
  in all seriousness poland is one of the few countries i 'd like to move to as of now . 
  the progress its making is astonishing , and it seems like a genuinely nice place to live . 
  if there 's one grievance about poland and poles , it 's the amount of dumbass 12 year olds playing lol . 
   speciall\u00e6gepraksis no idea what the f that would be ... 
  either way , denmark 's kinda cool . 
  definitely enjoyed my 6 months there , but the language contorts my tongue into weird shapes . 
  i do n't know , honestly . 
  i 'm quite happy here , but it 'd be germany . 
  like denmark , only less expensive and depressing and with a language i can actually speak . 
  i also would n't mind croatia , poland , latvia or estonia . 
  pretty much anywhere as long as it 's in central , northern or eastern europe . 
  maybe somewhere in the benelux . 
  not sure . 
  either way , not a fan of the western states or the british isles .
