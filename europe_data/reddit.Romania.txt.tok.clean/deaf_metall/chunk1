for me it 's `` why do poles live longer '' ; `` do n't beat their kids '' and third `` why they hate us . 
  the irony . 
  do n't get me wrong , that 's what i was trying to say . 
  outside of some nationalistic people and groups , most hungarians do n't seem to care . 
  they do have some [ ultra nationalistic groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-four_counties_youth_movement ) that hate romanians with a passion . 
  but most hungarians living in romania do n't seem to give a crap . 
   people in rural areas do n't even lock their doors . 
  so true . 
  everyone knows everyone in rural areas here . 
  i have a half gypsy half romanian neighbour who inhales that stuff . 
  he 's in his early 20s , most of his teeth fell off , dropped out of school in 8th grade , been in prison for a year and now he 's in prison again for theft and robbery . 
  grew up with him for 10 years . 
  he once beat the shit out of a guy cause he literally thought he was satan . 
  you 're not alone brotha .

  we do n't dig up dead people and eat their heart anymore because we think they 're vampires , that was centuries ago . 
  that fucker was dead drunk . 
  pfft , [ we still win . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strigoi#applications ), 
  we did have vampires before bram stoker 's book , but named [ strigoi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strigoi ) or [ moroi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moroi ) , not vampires . 
  also , [ what the fuck ?

  you 're jelly we had a fucked in the head guy who impaled everyone back in the days , huh ? 
  vlachs may have gradually migrated north , but why else if there was n't already another vlach majority , with a similar language and culture to them ? 
  dacians kept living north of danube , there 's enough evidence out there if you search for it . 
   besides , those lands might also have been quite nice , why move on from them . 
  that 's what i 'm saying about the balkans , if they lived there for so long , why start migrating towards north all of the sudden ? 
  and could u explain why the vlachs were n't given the same rights as the other invited guests ? 
  but were seen as a lower class , not even allowed to build stone houses or churches . 
  and why would a bunch of peasants go to a place to have less rights than they would have back at their home ? 
  and how could you explain moldova and wallachia ? 
  if the population boom of vlachs in the north happened because the king of hungary invited them in transylvania , how come they were more numerous in wallachia and moldova ? 
  [ notice the aromanians being under the jirecek line ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/map-balkans-vlachs.png ) . 
  in fact , out of all the vlach dialects , i can understand [ aromanian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsae4hrmxrs ) the best , even though it was under greek influence . 
  nobody is an expert on this topic , because it does n't take into consideration alot of thing and is made up from hungarian hatred towards romanians . 
   and the carpathian basin was sparsely populated during the hungarian conquest . 
  source ? 
  i never understood how hungarians got that idea . 
  first of all , why in the name of jesus would anyone migrate from the byzantine empire towards the mongol invasion ? 
  they spoke greek in the byzantine empire , so we should be speaking greek not latin . 
  if that is the place where we come from , how did we manage to be the majority of transylvania , wallachia and moldova in such a short time , but the vlachs south were always the minority ? 
  how is that a problem ? 
  lol, 
  i 've been in italy during summer at the sea in rimini . 
  i stole air and nobody caught me . 
  also , fuck your tv channels , i did n't see any cartoons and i still remember [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ho1qidem44 ) that they kept putting every 30 minutes on music channels . 
  edit : that was like 8 or 9 years ago , ca n't remember . 
  italy also made me get a cat back home , cause 1 cat and 3 kittens from a neighbour used to come by our house and i liked playing with them . 
  it 's a possibility , but the romans [ did n't conquer all of dacia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_dacians ) , so they would n't have needed to go so far north . 
   it is said that the dacians cried when an infant was born and joyed when a man died . 
  this is because they believe that life was actually a curse where you had to prove yourself worthy to die . 
  oh religion , fu ** ing people over since time immemorial . 
   basically transylvania had the highest gold resources during roman times , even now if i 'm not wrong . 
  oops . 
  in europe , not the whole world . 
  ma bad, 
  could you tell us about this theory ? 
  all i 've heard is bs from youtube extremists that we 're albanians who changed our language and migrated into transylvania , wallachia and moldova . 
  https://youtu.be/nvsdr6oyxaq when the dacians arrived , they assimilated with the local people . 
  even today , romanians put decorative sings like those on their traditional clothing/houses without really knowing what it means . 
  we 're not really sure these are really dacian words , they were reconstructed using languages that may have been influenced by dacians/thracians . 
  it explains [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_reconstructed_dacian_words#methodology ) how they reconstructed the words . 
  basically transylvania had the highest gold resources ( in europe ) during roman times , even now if i 'm not wrong . 
  trajan wanted it , came in our country , lost the first battle , won the second one , killed alot of people , forcefuly assimilated us so we wo n't rebel , gave dacians the chance to be in his army . 
  bam latin language . 
  we do n't even know how our old language is like , just some words here and there that were preserved . 
  the longest party in human history ( 123 continous days ) was held by trajan with transylvanian gold after the conquest of dacia . 
  forced to learn latin after almighty trajan commited mass genocide , oppressed by hungarians and austrians ( i 'm from transylvania ) , got f 'd over by the turks , got f 'd over by the russians . 
  any grudges ? 
   it 's funny when in italian the word for potato also means vagina we have the same thing for plums . 
   getting that sweet endorphin rush from `` doing something good to a real person '' pfft , just wait a few years until your people will notice where the money really go to .
