  probably not much .

  is there a sub for street music btw ? 
  pay tribute 100 cevapcici a week and maybe i wo n't / nevermind we got our own version which is superior !, 
  you are screwed now !!, 
  run and hide, 
  i do n't like iliescu one bit so what he says means little . 
  i did n't say i 'd support any . . irredentism anyway . 
  right wingers are pretty weak here actually which is great and rare in europe these days . 
  serbia - [ timoc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timo%c4%8dka_krajina ) for the vlachs . . since we recognise vlachs , aromanians and some other kinds of peoples as romanians then we could fragment most of the balkans even more since they are spread all over south eastern europe [ cernauti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chernivtsi_oblast ) and much of [ odessa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odessa_oblast ) in ukraine [ vlachs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlachs ) [ aromanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians ) [ meglenoromanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megleno-romanians ) [ istroromanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istro-romanians ) the [ morlachs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morlachs ) are gone and the others are soon to follow, 
  the tower of babel in bruxelles, 
  russian media tries to show the west as being more backwards . . decadent homo etc they gathered material here about how poor some are and try to link it with the fact that we 're in the eu as the reason, 
  meanwhile http://freebeacon.com/national-security/russia-moving-missiles-rockets-toward-eastern-ukraine/, 
  [ gorbachev confirms there was no nato ` non-expansion ' pledge ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-this-week-hundreds-of-russians-poisoned-25-dead-in-spice-drug-epidemic/ ), 
  all 5 of them ? 
  who wants to cooperate with ` enemies ' ? 
  and anyway then they get marked as enemies of the people and 5th column then they get killed misteriously or sent to prison, 
  english http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-bulgaria-s-boiko-borisov-plasters-together-a-minority-coalition-government-2032728, 
  that 's the official reason which has n't changed yet, 
  there have already been threads from time to time about this shield being installed it 's not something really new and the thread is only 1 hour old  what would have happened if it was russia who installed anti-missile interceptors in ... let 's say mexico ? 
  i would n't care one bit . 
  yeah it 's basically identical, 
  well we 're talking about it in general wan na do it by counties ? 
  or villages ? 
  maybe he thinks it would bring more trade with asia because of that . . maybe he thinks asian politicians are so racist that it would matter for them, 
   and i know we have more to do to encourage true opportunity and diversity in our country unless they are eastern europeans, 
  in part maybe they ca n't do much except bending over to the nazi imperialists and it may even help the chekist system strengthen so why bother, 
  they ca n't really have success without westerners going putinist i do n't expect any ww3 anyway . . just cold war, 
  very easy guess besides the obvious choice it 's bulgaria or serbia balkans in general language is the main difference, 
  nothing much it seems just geting ties with eu to improve economy and hope transnistrians like this and motivate them to go west while russia has problems helping them, 
   interesting , was this outcome desirable or has it happened accidentally ? 
  did n't russia even impose it 's own sanctions ? 
  it deserves this though, 
  yeah we have to keep things tight here and hope we do n't see more politicians side with putin the next years are very important, 
  that remains to be seen it 's good for him if the masses are turning more against ` the foreign enemy ' and thus rally around putin which is likely to happen considering how much people there rely on very crooked media so he could get more support domestically to go even more autocratic the problem is what happens after that, 
  it 's southern, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ursari we probably do n't have them anymore but it 's a very recent change, 
  chinese too ? 
  yeah we ca n't all be drunk someone has to work, 
  it was a ` btw ' comment, 
   light . 
  you have to wake up 2-3 hours earlier when it 's night to make it to school like at 5, 
  russian mafia has little influence here they do in bulgaria though i think in moldova too, 
  i dont think they can do much short term, 
  the theology ~ ~ schools ~ ~ factories keep making priests and they all need churches i do n't think most of them usually get filled . 
  there are ~ 19 000 churches and 5000 schools + hospitals while there are big infrastucture problems especially in rural areas where kids in some villages have to * walk kilometers * to the nearest school since 1989 we 've built 200 new churches per year while schools were closed by 1000/y 3 times fewer schools since 1990 it is very common for the government to give more church funding when there are elections . . millions of euros like for the current campaign the pm got 66.6 % votes in patriarch 's native village where he gave money to make a monastery the president is complaining about church 's involvement but only because it no longer helps him too ( he supports a certain party and one of the candidates ) i remember reading somewhere that only ~ 10 % of the church 's money goes to charity while the rest is for administrating ( much stolen i guess because at least the higher rank priests seem to be very rich , driving luxury cars and going to 4 * hotels ), 
  cooperation ? 
  russia has cooperation with nato too you know well actually just until september, 
  no it 's part of romania it really is ( half of it ), 
  you 're kinda stuck just like russia good learning by orban from putler first you raise nationalism enough so a group of scary right wingers get enough power and then people will be discouraged to change the regime out of fear of that group gaining more support because there would be a power vacuum, 
  the pm said that the fm will lose his job if the 2nd round is n't better organised which is worthless because punishing him right then would be too late . . it 's not his own work alone anyway i mean it 's the party 's plan the government will likely change regardless of who wins, 
  to me there are hints that it could turn into fidesz because it shows more nationalism than usual and it has huge support in parliament . 
  ponta just said that he does n't want ( us ) to take orders from anybody else anymore . 
  their campaign is very negative and hateful with a lot of lies ( like johannis sold kids and things like that , they even sent mail to old people telling them that johannis cuts their pensions etc ) promoted by very biased media that reminds me of russian media and fox i do n't think they like russia ( very much ) but they are much less vocal against it than everyone else their interest is apparently more with china than russia psd already has huge support in parliament ( 64 % voted the last cabinet formula ) it used to be more towards 70ish initially yeah it 's very difficult to form new parties or run as independent 6 out of the 14 !, 
  candidates likely got their 200k signatures needed through fraud because all together they had 130k votes and there 's other kind of fraud too caught by media but the police does nothing right now it is very likely that psd will win another bit of propaganda that is very recent is that johannis sells transylvania to right wing magyars, 
  those in the east accept only the far right to come monitor were n't there some polls showing that most of the east is actually pro kiev ? 
  how likely is it that kiev accepts losing crimea and in return the russians retreat completely from the east ? 
  it 's kinda win win putler gets his special port and ukraine sees no frozen conflict . 
  or hot . 
  map of who won each county http://imgur.com/a0lwps0 blue ( transylvania mostly ) went with johannis red is psd ( moldova and everything else . . the republic of moldova and best korea are red too ) green is magyar party diaspora is 46 % johannis 16 % ponta psd, 
  and here is why all that was set up that way 1 klaus iohannis - 46,1 % 2 victor ponta - 16 % psd loses lots of % in the diaspora ( as always ) so they tried to limit voting overall it 's ~ 40-30 in ponta 's favour with some 5pc-ish candidates 6/14 candidates did n't even get 200k votes . . in total they have like 130k to run for this you need 200k signatures ( obviously each ) so there is a lot of fraud, 
  it rained milk and honey, 
  lol real socialism explain why there were elites and why they had lots of priviledges their lives were nothing like what you read about in this thread, 
   as far as food goes things were significantly better here than most wp countries , largely because besides the large collective kolkhoz type farms , small farming around the house was allowed for peasants and they could sell it in the city on farmers markets we still have those peasant markets what they sell is still much better than what we find in supermarkets though you have to pay attention because some sellers are just middle men selling imports, 
  we had a guy try the same thing a year or two ago i also remember some dude jumped from a high place inside the parliament ( in the big room where mps sit ) and broke his neck or something the same guy a month ago drove with his car inside the yard of the pm 's palace ( he just smashed through the barrier ) but he was stopped from doing anything else he had some gasoline in his trunk, 
  nope the source is someone not named ' a witness ' who tried to vote there / one ca n't be surprised by attitudes like this from the gerdarmes though remember this http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2010/10/18/rue89-publie-un-fichier-roms-de-la-gendarmerie-171383 ? 
   ponta is the incumbent prime minister of a country still haunted by corruption . 
  this being deliberate would not be that far-fetched . 
  and his party 's campaign has already shown to be very dirty, 
  this is no organisation problem it 's sabotage http://imgur.com/jgjpjkd, 
  yeah many did n't get to vote but they will probably be back in the 2nd round much earlier someone said she waited from 3 to 9 in munchen and then the doors closed when she was only a meter away from geting inside the german police got involved since people didnt want to leave, 
  http://imgur.com/a/0crg8 same in dublin where there was 1 station in all the country lots of stations where in remote areas with few romanians and there were few in some of the main areas, 
  no reactions from the ambassadors or the fm here, 
  http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/thousands-of-romanians-locked-outside-london-embassy-denied-their-right-to-vote-9834568.html the same in other places paris for sure too the gendarme bit is n't in foreign media yet, 
  there 's some comedy by [ caragiale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_luca_caragiale ) where it shows high society people back in early 20th century inventing french words like saying furculission for fork and lingurission for spoon towards end of scene 3 http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/chiri%c8%9ba_%c3%aen_provincie, 
  that would be really stupid imagine it joining tomorrow do you realise how much bad influence it would be over bruxelles ? 
  first lots and lots of reforms, 
  give us back the [ treasure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure ) of over 100 tonnes of gold and give up support for transnistria, 
  those leaders that have huge popular support . . yeah just the leaders are the problem http://www.gallup.com/poll/173597/russian-approval-putin-soars-highest-level-years.aspx 87 % here other link http://mashable.com/2014/08/06/putin-approval-rating/ they are behind what is going on, 
  english http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/thousands-of-romanians-locked-outside-london-embassy-denied-their-right-to-vote-9834568.html it was much like this all over the diaspora, 
   do ideological sides really have any meaning in our country ? 
  nope actually the cr is kinda leftists while it 's the other way around with the other ones but generally it 's just some grey because they just go with w/e suits them best for the moment they are more or less neoliberals party laws are very tough btw so it 's very difficult to bring new ones it 's hard to run as independent too actually the only new ones have ties with the mainstream ( satellite parties ) and are filled with the same old politicians, 
  it is for psd their slogan is ` proud to be romanian ' and they rely much on nationalism ( does it sound similar to another viktor ?? ), 
  ponta used to be called ponte because his ancestors are italians btw said so himself, 
  ponta leans towards china much while johannis is only pro euroatlanticism . 
  btw hunor got a pretty bad score dont you think ? 
  i think he 's gon na look to join the opposition because of this and depending on how the government will be next . 
  i 'm in the green too and i never voted the ` left ', 
  he might not get enough from the other candidates results will be very close in the 2nd round, 
  polling firms here are very biased wait for official results  digi 24 - most neutral tv station , but tends to support right wing candidates maybe center-right , not right wing . 
  what do you think right wing means ? 
  nobody from us ? 
  not even our rightwingers like these guys :d, 
  elections today look how well the government organised them http://imgur.com/a/0crg8 2-3 hour queues in some cases a lot more i think it 's done on purpose because the diaspora votes mainly against the government and especially against psd . 
  the campaign is very dirty psd accused the main opponent , iohannis , of being childless , trafficking kids in the 90s ( they even sent propaganda mail with things like this ) and the pm and main candidate ponta also compared the president 's regime to that of nazis . 
  in paris that is the only place where you can vote . 
  the diaspora there is n't that small to warrant this . 
  and some people in spain were paid 30 euros , shirts and free drinks for their vote .
