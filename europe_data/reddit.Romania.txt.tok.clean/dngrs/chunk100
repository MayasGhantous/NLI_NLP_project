  also they arent really against globalism . 
  they like it when it has to do with other countries of the same mould . 
  yeah i thought we do n't have to be pc anymore same with the alt-right term, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/politicaldiscussion/comments/4v5bai/was_the_dnc_vote_actually_rigged/ debunked, 
   it seems to me this is just about attaining national stability through order and oversight . 
  same thing happened in the ukraine war, 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/06/how-russia-dominates-your-twitter-feed-to-promote-lies-and-trump-too.html, 
  you can find some leftwing figures liking putin too, 
   i always wonder why people even expect these negotiations to be fully public populism and outrage culture these are very strong on reddit, 
  so the uk does this and meanwhile it orientates itself towards russia hmmm, 
  then some people here circlejerk about the antiuk sentiment, 
  more like fake dictatorship, 
  true sovereigns and patriots, 
  did he crack ur bubble ? 
  only the one reddit edgelords and trolls approve, 
  will she get an offer from rt too ? 
  who needs porn when you get fucked by putin all the time, 
  or let it all go to hell and let russia , turkey all other countries with little rule of law respect to join the eu because why not, 
  why are you poles so conspiratard about this ? 
  you say this in every thread critical of hungary 's politics, 
  i wonder if they use those scripts like the guys in donald were caught using https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/4ze7gm/massive_botnet_from_the_altright_racists_using/ the usual suspects are just a few, 
  it is nice to see such a powerful company not take advantage of its costumers . 
  yet, 
   women in power all over the world . 
  i 'm scared . 
   corruption ( though theoretically that 's not part of the criteria ) it kind of does when it affects border workers, 
  btw when pm ciolos was in the netherlands earlier this month he said no tie was made between those ports and romania joining schengen or not http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/ciolos--olanda-nu-a-conditionat-intrarea-romaniei-in-schengen-de-relatia-dintre-portul-constanta-si-rotterdam-426948, 
   the motives are clearely economical . 
  http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2016/01/20/pm-ciolos-after-meeting-president-hollande-romania-s-contribution-to-border-control-should-be-acknowledged-by-acceptance-to-schengen-18-20-49 january 2016 he was asked for support since 2015 http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2015/02/10/president-iohannis-i-asked-france-to-support-romania-s-accession-to-the-schengen-zone-18-48-59 this airbus thing is much more recent i think, 
  then the title needs misleading tag, 
  i would n't really be bothered if they would cut funds for the programs which with we have difficulty in using . 
  i mean in the ones where there 's usually leftover money . 
  others have good absorption . 
  why not both and not all labour like corbyn, 
  2 wrongs dont make a right , comrade . 
  how the fuck is facebook a news source, 
  another extremist in the pocket of russia this comes at the same time when the pm and boris also want russia relations to change . 
  iranian backed terorrism is good ? 
  it 's an eastern europe thing the left is connected to old commies ( more-so than the right ) and the ones who leave the country are especially disapproving of them, 
  yep more europe or give up on it entirely, 
  the joys of communism . 
  ha buried in downvotes, 
  giving in to populistic fears, 
  mm now it makes sense, 
  no i meant the taste/texture combination . 
  seems weird . 
  interesting meatballs dish with . . fries . 
  i only tried with mashed or natur . 
  :\\ it 's a good idea to mix tuna and spinach ? 
  why is this buried ? 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/baghdad-bombing-attack-isis-islamic-state-iraq-ramadan-shia-most-victims-muslims-killed-a7120086.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-attacks-isis-responsible-for-more-muslim-victims-than-western-deaths-a6737326.html http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/03/u-s-government-muslims-victims-82-97-terrorism-related-fatalities.html, 
  yeah 6 is n't much . 
  must be because of the shallow depth . 
  here 's an earthquake risk map for europe http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/uploads/pics/esc_sesame_pga_en.jpg, 
  reminder that most victims of isis are muslims of course i get buried for that, 
   ol you butthurt belters should grow a thicker skin . 
  they sit too long in their safe spaces so when they go outside to limit damage to their favorite regime they call everyone anti-russian shills and russophobes, 
  ha you got him there, 
  same with spiegel, 
  its ok cuz . . human rights are a cia invention or something, 
  http://bbj.hu/politics/lazar-orban-would-repay-scholarship-in-snub-of-soros_116700 by saying he would repay they are admitting to the issue, 
  the author of the euractiv piece is georgi gotev . 
  his father , goran gotev , worked for the bulgarian foreign affairs ministry during communism and after it . 
  he was a collaborator of the communist secret service . 
  https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sbj-bg.eu%2findex.php%3ft%3d17232 https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bnews.bg%2farticle%2f64059 this is quite surprising because afaik euractiv in general has a prowestern stance , it 's not some alternative media thing . 
  they managed to infiltrate it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euractiv more downvotes , comrades !, 
  orban was a protege of the soros foundation http://hungarianfreepress.com/2016/05/21/george-soros-becomes-the-orban-regimes-boogeyman/, 
  are you a red piller ? 
  a versteher source is credible, 
  itt so much damage control, 
  so soros backing viktor orban was towards that end, 
  sarkozy ending up with fn in round 2 will make le pen president . 
  judging by his and his party 's recent overtly prokremlin stance i think it is on purpose . 
  its even less likely that the eu will, 
  yeah cool but why the selfies too lol, 
  no , i just explained your mental gymnastics . 
  not caring about what you say is not the same with '' anonymous people on the internet do n't ruin my mood irl . '', 
  you ** ruining my mood ** . 
  meh if i said nothing you would have thought i was so mad i could n't respond . 
  what 's with all the torygraph spam today ? 
  not one bit . 
  anonymous people on the internet do n't ruin my mood irl . 
  i 'm not 12 . 
  why would you do such a stupid thing ? 
  it 's just attention whoring, 
  says the guy who only went `` lol '' above, 
  dae eurss dictatorship ? 
   about young naive redditors and their delusions . 
  in particular the internet 's alt-right neckbeards, 
  uh you brought in the butthurt downvoters now, 
  you have to do these things when you barely have any muslims or jihadis in that country , right ? 
  racial realists, 
  big if true, 
  also you could nail garlic and scare the vampires, 
  that 's what happens when you barely have any in the country, 
  haha how downvoted this is 59 % you alt-righters are so scared of your bubble bursting this reminds me of fn and their false flags http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/france-fn-militants-burned-cars-fuel-insecurity-political-gain-1505631 who knows what people with much more power and same agenda do, 
  hardcore berners and the alt-right . 
  redbrown alliance . 
  yeah which i find it very dubious when i see some smart experienced politicians proposing reunification .
