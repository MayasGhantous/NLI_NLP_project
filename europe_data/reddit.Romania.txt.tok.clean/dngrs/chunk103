  it 's funny that someone from the_donald complains about this kind of thing, 
  old people dont google they are well informed already by the daily mail and the sun, 
  because bojo could be the replacement, 
   there is a reason why uk left a dumb one cuz the uk had opt-out, 
  knowing how antiscience ukipers are ... yeah, 
  boris will get ideas from the chechen wars, 
  we know it is a city, 
  i bet corbyn is rejoicing too, 
  sure, 
   mr. putin 's spokesman , dmitry s. peskov , told russian news outlets that he hoped a britain outside the european union would understand `` the need to build good relations '' with russia . 
  aha relations built likely by boris ex mayor of londongrad, 
  the convinced leavers will stay that way yeah but there are people on the edge who can be convinced otherwise leave won with like 2 % difference so anything matters a lot, 
  ours is about gays, 
  there needs to be some sort of factchecking institution and make it known to people something like politifact ie i know the eu has some fact checking thingies but very few people know about them, 
  you wan na end up like jo cox ? 
   it only helps anti-eu liars in their home countries . 
  yeah rushing to show the likely negative effects of brexit will mean less support for populists in netherlands , france , etc. 
  they need time to get more power . 
  now that he will get much more power and responsability he backpeddles, 
  how does the pax term show a claim to be successor of rome ? 
  did the mongolians claim too ? 
  yay free trade, 
  same with the dutch one if there 's a referendum in france too soon should we expect the same shit ? 
   to put things in perspective , a third of a trillion vanished from your economy in 1 hour . 
  that 's more than your current contribution to the eu , for a half of century !, 
  some links on this pls, 
   i still have hope something will be done to prevent an actual exit , what could happen ? 
  this particular referendum is binding, 
  you forgot boris likely new pm, 
   or individual eu member states - to give the uk a ` good deal ' after all this ? 
  i can expect countries run by euroskeptics trying to help uk so not to be a very bad example, 
  the uk will either give in to ireland/scotland or use more strong man policies maybe a la russia to keep itself together . 
  i trust boris to be counseled well . 
  myeah merkel taking revenge, 
  it 's disappointing how much lieing there was in the campaign and how uninformed people here . 
  i 'm reminded of the dutch referendum . 
  the new pm http://infacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/battle-bus.jpg, 
  but they are men of the people , against the establishment . 
  how can they be so deceitful ? 
  by like 2 %, 
  no the uk voted to leave so england wales ni must be kicked out, 
  a brave new blonde world is coming with boris , trump , le pen , wilders , putin running it . 
  both arent, 
  which is 10 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#funding_by_member_states u still got 450m, 
  but free and independent suffering, 
  posting in historical thread, 
  charles king leading to more support for republicanism, 
  can i have a link on that plz, 
  and this referendum was quite close to being a remain win, 
  what happens with the mi5 conspiracy now ? 
  he is just a very slow thinker . 
  sign of wisdom and patience virtue . 
  he gon na have to shittalk about scotland now, 
  i have a problem with ie commies . 
  they are n't alt-right . 
  wales just lost 500m pounds worth of eu annual funding http://gov.wales/funding/eu-funds/?lang=en but np boris will patch it, 
  most of the old people here tend to vote with the most corrupt parties, 
  it 's crazy that people think trump isnt part of the establishment and actually against it too, 
  dont leave your house then some brown boogeyman is out there to get you better be safe than sorry, 
  far right mep seems to have gotten into the ep on fn 's marine blue rally list he was a middleman for fn 's ` loan ' from russia https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-luc_schaffhauser, 
  rip uk inc english immigrants to scotland gg farage, 
  poland 's overreacting when youth day was in spain just a few years ago nothing happened . 
  just seculars protesting . 
  it 's secularism that scares those in power now in poland and they need a safe space for that event . 
  there 's this l'etat c'est moi idea still going on that 's what happens when there 's a cult for the president, 
  there are foreign users on this sub backing leave too, 
  hurr durr but economists are part of the globalist cabal, 
  why does a foreigner care so much ? 
  good point the dutch can run a referendum but delayed, 
  but people are in the mood to watch the world burn it 's mesmerizing, 
  seems like you need a safe space, 
  as if leavers trust economists, 
   if you are from a country with a history of russian occupation , you should be terrified at the prospect of a crumbling eu . 
  except for some central countries which are turning against the eu, 
   i think eu will survive and move to federal state . 
  not with exiters all over eu now encouraged ane britain wasnt the only one blocking federalisation attempts, 
  muh sovereingty feels, 
  yeah emotional and dubious economic arguments won here too so why not expect the same for scotland, 
  why am i not surprised you follow far right sites what 's with all these american alt-right guys recently ? 
  boris will be the one doing that lol, 
  its definitely haarp trust me cuz i listen to infowars, 
  yes https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/russian-journalists-meduza-project-latvia-kremlin-crackdown, 
  it 's the mi5 again, 
  another buried thread, 
  he doesnt lose the grant if brexit happens, 
  around half of those lieing publications seem to be owned by murdoch http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/  sadly , for all the commission 's hard work , it is unlikely to be heard . 
  the average rebuttal is read about 1,000 times . 
  the daily mail 's website , by contrast , garners 225m visitors each month . 
  yep same here there are some here actually but very few, 
  maybe he 's not wrong ( for some of them ) wide spread alcoholism leads to fetal alcohol syndrome which is associated with trisomy 21 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.1987.tb01258.x/abstract;jsessionid=c43cb08a1c8d64d51c17f479abc3a329.f02t03 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_consumption_in_russia#impact https://www.fic.nih.gov/news/examples/pages/fas-russia.aspx http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fetal-alcohol-disorders-idusbre98804i20130909 i doubt this is what he thought of tho :d, 
  such lunacy in the leave side, 
  wrong message target, 
  if americans drank bleach , you would do it too . 
  while still whatabouting, 
   they are as harsh as the united states ones !!, 
  how ? 
  see state high level support for conspiracies, 
  i wonder who they will blame for the problems, 
  he 's not wrong, 
  made online ?
