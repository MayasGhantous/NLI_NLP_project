  weyman bennett , joint secretary of the campaign group unite against fascism , drew a distinction between `` racist populists '' , who oppose immigration and want to leave the eu but would never countenance violence , and `` euro-fascists '' , who embrace anti-eu sentiment as part of an effort to overthrow the democratic order in favour of white-supremacist rule . 
  `` the campaign about leaving [ the eu ] means that if you are a fascist you now have a bridge into mainstream politics , '' he said . 
  `` they have always felt that no one listens to them . 
  now they feel like they strike a chord . '' additional reporting by leila haddou and henry mance . 
  is that a 4chan meme or something ? 
   that was unexpected . 
  kind of but there is something to gain with this too uk blocks further integration and his camp doesnt want that i wonder if it has something to do with putin trying to play nice atm,

  before their posts get deleted, 
   http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ is there a page for other countries too ? 
  yes most countries have mostly just bad press, 
  lel you 've triggered some ppl from the donald in this row, 
  [ putin after leave wins ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02846/putin_2846194c.jpg ), 
  no no it 's just ` realpolitik ', 
  myth 4 : nato exercises are a provocation which threatens russia . 
  fact : every nation has the right to conduct exercises , as long as they do so within their international obligations , including notifying the actual numbers and providing observation opportunities when required . 
  in order to promote mutual trust and transparency , osce members are bound by the vienna document to inform one another in advance of exercises which include more than 9,000 troops , unless the exercises are snap tests of readiness . 
  nato and allies have consistently stood by the terms and the spirit of the vienna document . 
  those exercises which crossed the notification threshold were announced well in advance . 
  this is why russia was invited to send observers to the nato exercise trident juncture in october-november 2015 . 
  russia , on the other hand , has repeatedly called snap exercises including tens of thousands of troops , with some of them taking place close to nato territory . 
  this practice of calling massive exercises without warning is a breach of the spirit of the vienna document , raising tension and undermining trust . 
  this is especially the case because russia 's military takeover of crimea was masked by exactly such a snap exercise . 
  it is therefore russia 's exercises , not nato 's , which are a threat to stability . 
  steinmeier is full of shit, 
  keep it up steinmeier and maybe you too will work for gazprom in the future, 
  extra downvotes for making a rightwinger look bad, 
  why is that treason ? 
  meanwhile the bulgarian pm speaks about russia like a hippie, 
  they will rather go to another country, 
  why the downvotes ? 
  i bet most of the antittip activists wont complain about an eurasian one, 
  britain first is largely an online one too, 
  hopefully in some years we only see them in r blunderyears, 
  yes, 
  some but new ones were formed, 
  what a hypocrite, 
   britain first are a far right political group on facebook . 
  they have nothing to do with the brexit campaign at all it 's a political party https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britain_first#electoral_history, 
  ah getting buried in downvotes what a regressive leftwing circlejerk this sub is amirite, 
  so subversion and heavy propaganda operations will end ? 
  i call bs, 
  the far right subs seem to be ignoring this new bit of info, 
  basically china focuses on ee where russia has n't been successful enough team effort, 
   russia obviously needs to return the krim to ukraine , but is this really the best way to achieve this ? 
  one point is to try to discourage more annexations from happening in the future, 
   one eyewitness told the bbc they heard her attacker shout `` put britain first '' at least twice beforehand . 
  meanwhile someone across the ocean is using america first as a slogan, 
   eastern europe would n't agree . 
  except bulgaria, 
  same power group in 2001 like it is now, 
  how many upvotes would this have if he was an islamist or leftwing ? 
  it would make it to r/all and people still circlejerk about this sub being so leftwing its minus something atm, 
  they dont have to care about economic facts the same way the uk ignores them, 
  rip make britain great again meme for brexit, 
  legal costs down  ) but he is supposed to be very rich he got the bad publicity by settling it instead of fighting, 
  what 's wrong ? 
  take first exameple the justice department sued his company -- twice -- for not renting to black people when trump was serving as the president of his family 's real estate company , the trump management corporation , in 1973 , the justice department sued the company for alleged racial discrimination against black people looking to rent apartments in brooklyn , queens and staten island . 
  the lawsuit charged that the company quoted different rental terms and conditions to black rental candidates than it did with white candidates , and that the company lied to black applicants about apartments not being available . 
  trump called those accusations `` absolutely ridiculous '' and sued the justice department for $ 100 million in damages for defamation . 
  without admitting wrongdoing , the trump management corporation settled the original lawsuit two years later and promised not to discriminate against black people , puerto ricans or other minorities . 
  trump also agreed to send weekly vacancy lists for his 15,000 apartments to the new york urban league , a civil rights group , and to allow the nyul to present qualified applicants for vacancies in certain trump properties . 
  just three years after that , the justice department sued the trump management corporation again for allegedly discriminating against black applicants by telling them apartments were n't available . 
  why settle the case when you know you did nothing wrong ? 
  you go all the way and then people see that the justice dept is just out to get you for bs reasons . 
  so bosnia is the next to be visited by little green men the difference this time is that russia will have to work through other countries , bosnia does n't border it . 
  russia has some sort of base in serbia http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/russian-presence-in-nis-does-not-seem-military/26702164.html @last answer, 
  i mean i doubt the will power . 
   but , if you are just trying to make yourself feel better through political tribesman-ship how am i doing that ? 
  you think i vote left wing parties ? 
  i never have . 
  so another myth busted ? 
  we knew long before what period of time the campaign is in they knew too, 
  interesting timing now with the brexit campaign wonder if it 's on purpose to help that . 
  what do swiss mps think of it ? 
  in particular the chambers or w/e u have u leaders . 
  good luck countering hackers inside russia with conventional weapons, 
   without pulling a huge shit storm . 
  which means nothing and seems to be worth it, 
  another border to eu/nato, 
  no reason for it to be diffferent btw the minsk sanctions ignore the crimea situation . 
  david duke , the former leader of the kkk , endorsed donald trump http://www.thewrap.com/ku-klux-klan-leader-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-video/  is not a racist a congressman from his own party thinks he is because of his comments on a mexican judge http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/08/politics/reid-ribble-donald-trump-racist/index.html you can find examples of his racism here http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83 as the congressman says , if it walks like a duck , talks like a duck , it is likely to be a duck . 
  are you saying i implied donald trump is hitler ? 
  where did i do that ? 
  no but im seeing more and more american rightwingers on muslim threads with post history on white supremacist kind of subs im not saying all of them are but it 's definitely more than i could notice like a year ago . 
  vote for brexit think of the children, 
   f a l s e f l a g - seeboar are you serious ? 
  w8 ur that guy who made fun of me when i showed proof that the daily stormer encouraged people to shill on reddit here but now you believe in left wing false flags and with absolutely no proof https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4niyfr/nationalism_is_rising_not_fascism/d44o2nk, 
  maybe trump brings them back, 
  reminds me of 2 terrorists a few years ago who bought islam for dummies books http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mehdi-hasan/jihadist-radicalisation-islam-for-dummies_b_5697160.html, 
  so a red-brown opposition, 
  inb4 it 's a left wing attacker because she isnt `` true left '' or w/e, 
  where are the proofs ? 
   the terrorist acts changed a lot more like the american trolls, 
   after reading some of the comments on here i have realized the majority of the members are pro-eu to a point that the simple fact of opposing their views guarantees you massive downvotes i 've seen users get high upvoted comments saying that eu is either a fascist dictatorship or literally ussr is this post some kind of baiting or what ? 
  hello i am bullshitting about repression . 
  upvotes to the left !,
