  i bet soros is behind this . 
  and iirc he got cleared of it, 
  so besides crimea and moving the border in georgia what will be next ? 
   ) of course he was bluffing he doesnt want to be pushed much towards china because it will dominate them instead he knows that europe west of him is very spineless and fragmented , much easier to deal with . 
  with china , russia would be the one exploited . 
  the tricks putin uses against the west do n't work with china . 
  ie using media propaganda to trick the chinese people like you do with western ones wont work because china has no issue with just banning medias . 
  so he secretly wants the same thing as farage, 
  to taunt english fans, 
  oh yeah fifa but it was for platini ( uefa ) 's votes :d, 
  mainly western institutions, 
  putin bought it from platini ( replaced at uefa by a close acolyte ) so it 's not gon na happen, 
  it 's hard not to be suspicious when the president is `` ex '' kgb and we already know about other subversive or more open activities, 
  yeah on another sub it was implied i am a shill to suspect political backing and got buried in downvotes, 
  russian hooligans see themselves as kremlin foot soldiers http://reuters.com/article/iduskcn0yz1z7, 
   he is so outraged by the travesty of justice so is lavrov too http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/lavrov-says-detention-of-russian-fans-in-marseille-is-unacceptable-incident.html, 
  it must make him feel good that he showed his displeasure i guess, 
   if you are asking why is n't the russian government doing much about it , well that 's because they have to balance their interests with the rich and powerful , and now seeing the article it would seem that some rich and powerful people wanted this to happen , but i doubt that it was the russian governments wish . 
  ah that made me laugh out loud, 
   to give a boost to front national friends who can cry out about government failures , tougher laws , immigration and troublemakers , one year before the french president 's election next year , in marseille , nice and lille regions , where fn is at its peak bingo,

   being a whiny wimp does n't make it better . 
  he went straight to the ref after the last whistle lol, 
  i love seeing him miss fks . 
  it 's so predictable . 
  there 's a middle eastern fast food at every corner in romania and we barely have any muslims, 
  why didnt russia blacklist these guys ? 
  they seem connected with those with responsability https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/13/far-right-activist-euro-2016-russian-fa-alexander-shprygin-nazi-salute is someone back home gon na give them a medal when the euro is over ? 
  depends if le pen gets in power :d or some chirac type like sarkozy, 
  yeah it 's quite an achievement, 
  big numbers from albania serbia and georgia considering the size opposite for turkey, 
  so instead they rather have a russian ally inside the eu, 
  but hurr durr facts are fear mongering, 
  huh rt backs trump too, 
  good relations with serbia is a myth they did absolutely nothing to help against both fascists and commies here despite the balkan pact they didnt recognise our part in the 1877-1878 war against turkey again no recognition of our part against germany at the 1919 peace conference . 
  they made their own peace in 1916 when bucharest was occupied by germans . 
  they invaded romania in 1918 ( the romanian half of banat ) then you have a history of very popor treatment of romanians in serbia . 
  same for bulgaria and especially greece too . 
  there are no real allies around romania . 
  they are more with russia . 
  weird i thought you were, 
  . . none really . 
  umm the us if trump loses . 
  russian trolls wouldnt be a thing if they didnt care about foreign opinion a lot, 
  i suspect lesbians would be ok . its gay men that trigger homophobes . 
  and like half of reddit judging by worldnews and other subs comments, 
  yeah and hungary ( along with austria ) has a history of siding with russia against us, 
   the commission is investigating potential anticompetitive practices in the transmission and supply of natural gas in romania , in particular relating to suspected anticompetitive behaviour aimed at hindering natural gas exports from romania to other member states they are trying to protect russia 's share of the market in neighbouring countries since 4 years ago we were supposed to do more about exporting but we kept delaying, 
  yeah other countries including mine think same shit, 
  not surprising it was already notable the support russia gives to trump, 
  careful cuz rising alcohol prices might bring unrest, 
  lol pretty much every country around you thinks that everyone thinks they are this special middle snowflake, 
   http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2016/06/pm_2016.06.13_epw-02-06.png the orban effect, 
  idk maybe sportsaccord ? 
  it 's some kind of alternative olympics thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sportaccord it 's run by people close to putin tho so i doubt it 's not rotten too, 
  little green fans, 
  very weak they should be prosecuted , not just sent away . 
  who 's against that ? 
  it 's not really new the hungarians do the same paramilitary thing or maybe they learned from russia, 
  i bet they add them as dlc lol btw guys stop buying dlc whoring games, 
  that is casus belli, 
  the yearly budget of those is maybe less than a 10th of that the way the damage was calculated is by just adding all the clauses players had ( even the ones very unlikely to be triggered ) . 
  there 's no expert in romania to properly evaluate the worth of that club so they went with that . 
  shouldnt he report this to prosecutors ? 
  nah they 'll make their own like the soviets did lol maybe they are pushing to be given an excuse stirring shit then playing the victim to make it acceptable to the local public, 
  some of today 's news http://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/un-fost-prefect-degalati-tocmit-asasin-ucide-cea-denuntase-dna-ucigasul-era-politist-acoperire-1_575ea9045ab6550cb8e7da03/index.html an ex prefect tried to hire a hitman to kill a woman who reported him to the prosecutors he talked to a mobster who then told the police ( idk why ) and they made a sting with an undercover cop pretending to be the hitman shows how good we are at this hitman stuff, 
  some of them band together the blonde in op ie when she first got arrested she made this mobster gesture https://politicata.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/udrea_50374700zoom_resize.jpg during the vote to lift her immunity http://www.luju.ro/static/images/2015/februarie/11/udrea_nas_iccj.jpg during arrest she did that to show that she will keep silent . 
  she is of the highest tier of crooks and very connected . 
  some of them do rat some other big crooks tho but it does n't seem to be common . 
  it 's the low rank guys that usually rat :d, 
  yeah afaik some neighbouring countries are trying to emulate what we are doing, 
  funny thing when the turn comes for a hungarian party politician to be investigated sometimes they run to hungary and the hungarian state gets involved to criticise what is going on, 
  well its either that or you are the puppet of america and a russophobe, 
  even foreign polls give putin over 80 % approval inside russia http://www.gallup.com/poll/173597/russian-approval-putin-soars-highest-level-years.aspx http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/08/05/russia-putin-held-in-low-regard-around-the-world/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_image_of_vladimir_putin#ratings_and_polls, 
   i ca n't help but wonder whether russia 's deliberately trying to stir-up violence with england supporters to foster division between england and the rest of europe , during this key period in the referendum campaign . 
  the politicians do this to get russia sanctioned somehow by uefa so then they can reinforce the siege mentality, 
  no no lets try to appease somehow, 
  https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/742377374453469189 russian top cop : gay pride parades have made french police weak and unprepared for mighty , manly russian hooligans former press officer of the russian football federation writing the same thing in his blog http://www.sports.ru/tribuna/blogs/mlosolov/966631.html, 
  yeah he has low credibility now, 
  long term yeah maybe, 
  the eurasian one ? 
  organised practice for that doesnt happen here i havent seen it reported we dont have paramilitary hoodlums here like you have in hungary . 
  i 've seen them come here to train . 
  he 's a little mogul too like berlusconi he funded a local newspaper and a tv channel him and that constantinescu guy managed to run the port county of constanta for like almost 2 decades . 
  cunning bastards , constantinescu 's medics recently got accused of trying to help him get interned in a hospital instead of the prison 's facility noting an illness weaker then his real one . 
  crooks often play ill when they get caught but you see people like constantinescu at terraces and bars and then they post pictures of themselves supposedly being very ill on a hospital and how the prosecutors are cruel ( he got caught with that too in the us ) . 
  that bucharest mayor in op said he suspects cancer in order to get out of arrest . 
  after he went out we hear nothing about it anymore , he is all ok . 
  yeah it 's still a lot better than before, 
  yeah lol ex pm ponta took the justice minister as interim ( after that he named his cousin-in-law there iirc btw ) and proposed kovesi tho before winning elections to become pm he signed agreement with some factions to dismantle the anticorruption agency ( among other institutions ) . 
  a few years later he and his relatives are investigated by her agency . 
  the other chief prosecutors he named tho are investigated too so it 's not clear what happened . . some kind of trade ? 
  lol today there was a queue inside the anticorruption agency 's main hq http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/justitie/video+acuzati+de+coruptie+la+coada+la+dna see video, 
  yeah he 's still much less bad than his 2nd round opponent, 
  i think bbc edited the title since i posted they sometimes do that  russia faces uefa probe after england match violence was the original one first, 
  it shows how knowledgeable he is, 
  yes and one can see in op it 's ok to try to hide them with clothes or something, 
  it 's targetting both liberals and socialdems here and they are trying to band together against the justice system, 
  it 's photoshop because some think he 's a drug user, 
   yes , for example antena 3 ( belonging to voiculescu , one of the guys from the pictures ) is saying each night we are living hitler-like days in romania .
