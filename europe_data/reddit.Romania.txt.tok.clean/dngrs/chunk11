  the very paranoid kind, 
   wait this is n't something you can just deny looks like you can, 
  looks like the only 2 in the eu that matter for putin are france and germany and both are more or less supportive of him ( mainly germany ) . 
  no wonder the eu is so weak . 
  -   / r/conspiracy btw moscow has a very tight grip on ngos http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_foreign_agent_law you can imagine it is very difficult for the us to do something, 
  here it 's backgammon, 
   putin 's the top dog , arbiter and strong man that holds it all and he is no immortal so he knows he has to pick someone to follow in his foot steps  i mean he did n't even bother grooming a replacement . 
  maybe it 's for the next phase ( he 's 61 or something , he has time ), 
  it 's not really about the eu 's sanction because then it would try to fuck with other members too it 's because poland is very critical of russia which is not happening in most of the eu  poland has lobbied the european union hard to impose tougher sanctions on moscow , and it is to host elements of a new nato rapid reaction force , created in response to the russian intervention in ukraine . 
  meanwhile http://business.financialpost.com/2014/09/10/poland-looks-to-import-natural-gas-from-united-states-canada/?__lsa=c7b3-8773 germany 's e.on reporting the problem too http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/ukraine-crisis-gas-poland-idinl5n0rb2ki20140910, 
  they just denied it http://en.ria.ru/world/20140910/192812406/russias-gazprom-denies-reducing-gas-supplies-to-poland.html, 
   think long term . 
  in a couple years putin will be dead of old age or cancer . 
  other chekists will take over and continue the program  the eu and russia however will still be around . 
  and the eu will be a lot different expect to see a lot more orbans, 
   board games which ones ? 
  `` good dictatorship '' very funny, 
  you know nothing about eastern european history, 
  guys , notice how nato is becoming more and more impotent . 
   their opinion on matters pertaining to georgia or ukraine do not hold much sway in american or russian policy circles . 
  yes it does http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/sep/09/every-call-putin-has-made-to-a-world-leader-in-2014 most calls to merkel are from putin and obama it 's mainly countries besides germany and france that do n't matter, 
  the brazil visit was for the world cup, 
   gleb pavlovsky , a political technologist who worked on putin 's election campaigns but has since left the kremlin , told me recently . 
  `` or the idea that ` there is no alternative to putin . ' we invented that . 
  and suddenly there really was no alternative . '' plenty of people are buying that idea even outside russia `` do not do anything about putler because someone worse will take over '', 
  not here most tv viewers here have trust in [ voiculescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_voiculescu ) 's media ( fox/rt level ) even though it is obviously shit the guy even got sent to prison and they think this scumbag is a victim, 
  well berlusconi * is * one of his main allies in the eu so they obviously have great ties  former chekist former ? 
  you 'd be right if he was n't part of the ** government ** again : it was rogozin who is deputy pm who do you pay attention to if not people like him ? 
  i 've heard they have canadian tech . 
  i 've read that nos already apologised . 
  one of their ministers ( defense i think ) said he will return to romania in a bomber plane it happened a few months ago does this count ? 
   while the military of european countries is sufficient to ensure the safety of its territoy which european countries ? 
  it 's the pitesti - craiova highway , right ? 
   ** and some other things ** like highways tell me we cant build highways with eu money, 
   while it is still a major issue , the people in power are n't spending the funds because their use is monitored and very hard to swindle with yeah they are instead looking to china for money ie 6bn for 2 nuclear plants and some other things, 
  people just do n't like to know that it 's their own fault so * there must be a conspiracy *, 
  what is this ` truth out ' ? 
  they also rely on helping to get those right wing parties in power that favour good relations with them when are the next elections in france ? 
   more hardship for the russians is coming and hardship breeds instability . 
  not unless you 're a dictatorship and can invent and maintain the idea of an enemy to blame things on and go against it will work for a long time then go tits up and later they will do the same again and again and again, 
  no , it does need more resources . 
  it needs more arable land and ukraine got plenty , high quality too . 
  there 's also a lot of gas in the sea area around odessa . 
  it 's officially ours but if novorosia actually happens then they could try to claim it . 
  they also have a lot of interest in the arctic ( iirc they even recently set up a military base ) and it 's because they do have some problems in siberia . 
  they do not have that much oil left ( at least until some they can get some greater technology ) . 
  btw , much of the land in russia is useless . 
  here 's a link straight from russian state media http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/13-09-2013/125651-russia_oil_crisis-0/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/11080635/arctic-drilling-is-inevitable-if-we-dont-find-oil-in-the-ice-then-russia-will.html they need to keep expanding and hope prices stay up . . it 's what their government mainly relies on, 
  not too far at all http://imgur.com/cc32pyt til when are you serbs going to defend putin ? 
  not the same thing one is from * private * media * tabloids * and the other is russian * state * media private media especially tabloids do pretty much whatever the fuck they want because they 're private and , you know , tabloids !, 
  meanwhile on the other side it is straight kremlin fed ( dis ) info, 
  it 's actually quite likely to happen so far it looks like we 're heading that way, 
  right now the local rfi, 
   in russian foreign policy , eurasia is a plan for the integration of all the lands from -- you guessed it -- portugal to the bering strait . 
  does he mean this ? 
  yeah , i wonder who will be next to turn like that . 
  maybe bulgaria ? 
   anna arutyunyan , author of the book `` the putin mystique : inside russia 's power cult , '' said the lecture echoed theologically based propaganda from the byzantine empire , primarily the `` godliness '' of the emperor . 
  btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_rome#21st_century, 
  this just shows it does w/e it pleases anyway, 
  does n't the state ( not gdp ) get something like 40 % of it 's budget money from energy business ? 
   war is changing and the type of conflict nato was designed for is n't the type of thing we 're likely to see . 
  nato should check if article 5 can be somehow used against this war without war thing, 
   russia reacts to circumstances , but does not create them . 
   last thing russia created was the second chechen war . 
  you 're contradicting yourself, 
   only when relations with russia are radically improved meaning if chisinau changes it 's foreign policy 180 degrees which is very unlikely . 
  ie no more prowesternism and return to how it was before the best thing would be to just give up on it and let russia enjoy having that little hell hole but they do n't want to have it . 
  not until they take southern ukraine to link with it anyway . 
  the problem is that this might mean losing some votes and help the communists . 
  maltreatment ahahahha minorities here are generally better treated than in most eu countries actually aa new account just for trolling this is my last reply, 
   but since the independence of these regions is recognized by russia bullshit russia does not recognise transnistria officially  since the inhabitants will most likely not be interested in reunificatio it 's possible if russia backs out of this and/or those people like how moldova develops after integrating more in the eu, 
   i remember 6 years ago there was a commission formed by european countries which declared it 's all georgians ' fault , so rufed had to invade them . 
  got a link ? 
   is there anything eu is going to do to help moldova and georgia to repel invasions of russian federation disguised as protection in ethnic conflicts ? 
  i doubt it will do much . 
  especially if it 's about the already separatist regions . 
   even his choise not to participate in any debates reminds me of our pm he said he wo n't do that ( presidential elections coming very soon ) and it 's probably because he 's afraid of fucking up live on tv he has a big chance to win, 
  they are looking to see if they really are useful too maybe some see the reactions and alliances as weak, 
  yes but jayrate was talking about hitler and nazis, 
  if you guys decline then it is proof that you are fascists . 
  hmm i got a question does anybody know how russian media treats this subject ? 
  all that 's really missing is genocide, 
  he wants a coup but you have to take out all the core fsb and siloviki too or they will spawn another putin later, 
  did n't lenin try ? 
  i 'm glad more westerners ( apparently mainly the dutch so far though ) are starting to see it the way it really is . 
  lots of kremlinbots, 
  yeah he said that just during his visit in the us . 
  he wanted to make himself look good . 
  biden wants us to recognise it and the president disagrees . 
  last year the pm said romania will recognise it after there will be a new president ( he hopes to be him ) because the current one does n't want to . 
  i 'm ok with not recognising it . 
  yeah the russian church has very strong ties with the politicians keep in mind that the new eurasian idelogy is heavily based on orthodoxy, 
  yeah it 's a couple centuries old, 
  . . no u mean the one in deveselu , right ? 
  again some are random picks, 
  react by banning more imports directly from eu so middlemen firms in belarus make more money . 
  it 's really not enough and by ties i meant cultural , historical ones . 
  it was a genuine question, 
  they miss being invaded ?
