  love the new sickle logo any1 got a bigger pic of it ? 
  she 's likely proud and honored, 
   it 's not censorship , it 's keeping things tidy . 
  lol, 
  yeah now he keeps going like it 's business as usual, 
  premier league chairmen have urged the government to allow footballers from the european union exemption from post-brexit immigration controls . 
  more than two-thirds of players in the premier league are from overseas with the majority from eu countries and clubs fear that brexit could have a huge impact on their ability to make signings from the continent . 
  others , however , believe that a reduction in the number of european players in the premier league would give more chances to english players and boost the quality of the national team . 
  stars who would be barred seven top-flight europeans who would not meet work-permit criteria philip hammond , the chancellor , has promised that `` highly-skilled and highly-paid workers '' should not be subject to new controls and the stoke city chairman , peter coates , and west ham united 's co-owner , david gold , have called on theresa may to include footballers among those exempted . 
  if footballers are not given an exemption , those from the eu would have to satisfy work-permit rules that demand they have made a substantial number of appearances for their national team in competitive matches -- the actual number is a sliding scale depending on countries ' ranking from 30 to 75 per cent of games . 
  under those rules , players such as juan mata and ander herrera of manchester united and c\u00e9sar azpilicueta , the chelsea defender , would not satisfy work permit demands . 
  immigration controls generally are likely to come in from march 2019 after may triggered article 50 on wednesday . 
  greg dyke , the former fa chairman , has said that he hopes brexit will significantly reduce the number of `` very average european players '' taking the place of english talent but , speaking after a meeting of premier league chairmen in london , coates and gold said it was important that footballers were among those given exemptions . 
  coates said : `` we 'd expect them to be included . 
  but we have to wait and see . 
  we do n't know . 
  and i can tell you the prime minister does n't know , the guy leading it , david davis [ the brexit secretary ] , does n't know , boris johnson [ the foreign secretary ] certainly wo n't know . 
  `` i think the government 's got more on its hands than worrying about the premier league . 
  but they 've no more idea than i have of what 's going to happen . 
  so nobody knows how this is going to work out . '' more than two-thirds of players in the premier league are from overseas with the majority from eu countries , including chelsea 's azpilicueta julian finney/getty images the premier league had been in favour of remaining in the eu and coates said his mind had not changed . 
  `` i 'm pessimistic about leaving '' he added . 
  `` nothing 's changed my mind . 
  hopefully , football will find a way of looking after itself when it finally happens -- whenever that will be . 
  that could be years down the line . 
  `` we 're into the unknown . 
  what this is creating is uncertainty and we shall all look back in five years ' time and think , ` what the hell have we done this for ? 
  we 're worse off ' . 
  and , in ten years ' time , we 'll still be saying the same thing . '' gold said that west ham had felt the impact of brexit as buying players from europe had become more expensive after the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum last june . 
  he added that the government needed to protect the premier league from other negative effects of leaving the eu . 
  he said : `` it 's already affecting [ the english game ] because they are more expensive to buy because of the pound . 
  brexit has already had an impact on us in that sense . 
  `` the bottom line is the premier league is the greatest league the world has ever known . 
  it 's a fantastic advert for britain , for england . 
  i know people talk about the wealth that 's there , but these guys are on huge salaries and all the tax is going into the exchequer . 
  why would you stifle that ? 
  why would you want that to change ? 
  it 's a great advert . 
  `` the premier league goes around the world and it 's ever expanding . 
  i do n't see a government doing something potty to disturb that . '', 
  it 's weird how much the article links to wikipedia, 
  another donald troll on / r/europe http://i.imgur.com/fkxdygn.png, 
  good news for mobster networks in europe, 
  her mandate expires in 2019 and most politicians cant wait to get rid of her . 
  it 's likely why they accept this eu project in the first place . 
  big lack of women in china that means lots of frustrated people , social troubles . 
  it 's very bad for the regime 's stability . 
  nice read , 
  oops lol, 
  that must be why ie russia planned to assassinate tito because of his independence / s http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-12/news/mn-2405_1_yugoslav-leader they also meddled earlier too against pasic cuz he was also too independent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93serbia_relations#world_war_i,

  i dont remember . 
  i do know that they in polls arent favourable . 
  the romanians are . 
  i 'd be . 
  feels over reals same with romania and moldova, 
  it 's like one cant be true right wing unless being more tough with the darkies, 
  nice, 
  they should bury their heads in the ground, 
  populism . 
  the quality differs but the price is lower too . 
  so he will be some kind of immigrant refugee lol, 
  is there any other way to lift them now ? 
  if they could they would have went to war in montenegro like with ukraine but with countries that dont share border they just try a coup . 
  same with trumpets online most of them dont seem to be americans, 
  the market squares are kinda the same, 
  some of them are just peasants which tend to have darker skin . 
  still lots of idiots think the 90s were much better and romania only turned worse because of the eu, 
  a diversion is needed today . 
  maybe fsbleaks will come up with something . 
  the patriotic mods are busy doing damage control in other subs like this one, 
  crimea was also peaceful and did n't warrant intervention like kosovo needed . 
  it 's the original imperialism form pre-socialism the czar one, 
  wtf, 
  moldova has better soil i think . 
  same with the parts around the sea . 
  i was comparing to aqua carpatica, 
  the same formula is here with a loud mouth party led by ex socialdems, 
  yeah tamaioasa and feteasca, 
   we have a set of autochtonous grapes that survived the phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century , when most european varieties had to be interbred with american ones so that they survive . 
  links pls it does seem there was a problem with phylloxera http://www.premiumromania.com/history/index.html and the old vines were replaced with french ones the wine quality should be good enough for export . 
  i see it got some interesting awards http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2013/04/12/three-romanian-wines-awarded-gold-at-challenge-international-du-vin-in-bordeaux-18-07-21 http://www.winesofbalkans.com/index.php?balkan-states/romania http://www.vitis-metamorfosis.com/en/the-history-of-wine-and-viticulture-in-romania/ https://steemit.com/life/@ionescur/wines-and-vines-of-romania-about-phylloxera-the-great-enemy, 
  there 's some controversy with it 's marketing https://insulaindoielii.ro/2012/04/08/nitrati-si-manipulare/ http://www.wall-street.ro/articol/social/148452/analiza-ws-tu-stii-ce-bei-topul-celor-mai-sanatoase-ape-minerale-din-romania.html bucovina and azuga are much better and even cheaper, 
  fuck , i confused him with fillon . 
  vucic and his party are a lot like psd in romania . 
  iirc vucic and ex pm ponta are close friends . 
  btw there was a rumour recently that a very influencial crook , friends with ponta , is hiding in serbia . 
  he left the country and is hiding because of multiple investigations against him . 
   note : all opposition candidates ( jankovi\u0107 , jeremi\u0107 , radulovi\u0107 ) said they will support whoever reaches second round against vu\u010di\u0107 . 
  the radicals will side with vucic , no ? 
  it 's always the same users too right on cue, 
  politicians getting assassinated tends to make the news usually, 
  it 's weird how he keeps playing dumb, 
  which will lead to more radicalised muslims who will fuel jihad, 
  yeah the soviets back them a lot, 
  apparently the party grass roots is far left but the ones with power are far right, 
  ok so gipsyes are the original yuropeans then  ), 
  it 's somehow both soros and russia ( tho the russian officials back the government ) depending on who you pay attention to, 
  english article out yet ?
