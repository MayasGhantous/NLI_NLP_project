  no indian language either, 
  4 august 1919 best day in my life topkek til it was the first ever army to free a communist run state, 
   at this point self doubt starts : are we actually ghosts ? 
  or maybe golems ? 
  well that 's quite ingenious, 
   most of the funds flowed out of 19 russian banks , one of which , russian land bank , boasted russian president vladimir putin 's cousin , igor putin , as a board member . 
  surprise https://www.reportingproject.net/therussianlaundromat/the-russian-banks-and-putins-cousin.php remember the story with the fraud of 15 % of moldova 's gdp from it 's banks ? 
  https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/08/01/how-the-russians-helped-turn-moldova-into-a-hotbed-for-money-laundering/#201710aab783 i wonder if any of it is laundered in the eu now 63m were laundered in the us too through citibank and bank of america notice how much russia acts against the eu through all means but it 's interests like these lie with it, 
  kind of yeah but he is still only 1 guy, 
  yeah such groups seem encouraged anyway, 
  another one for the list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia counting over 130 just under putin 's terms, 
  amazing, 
  and now trump 's doing poorly when it comes to adding jobs to the economy, 
   it 's amazing how people were fooled about trump 's alleged opposition to the iraq war even bernie voted for that stuff ie iraq liberation act, 
  meanwhile people wanted to vote trump because the other one would have brought ww3 ... he even questioned why not use nukes if you gon na make them . 
  he has no idea what deterrance is . 
  and it 's ok for saudi arabia to have them because of some bullshit fatalistic reason and it 's also okay to be unpredictable with nukes . 
  yeah its mostly image and softpower damage tbf which is still a big deal tho, 
  good job , trumpski . 
  sounds like fascism coming from the ones who call others fascists all the time, 
  if he wins then he gains immunity he just has to win before being sentenced i think now he cant back off because he needs the immunity !, 
  lol, 
  very cynical and if ukraine doesnt do anything then they accept what happened and will likely have to deal with internal criticisms from some, 
  for ukraine its a fucked if u do , fucked if u dont thing . 
  any pole wan na give more details about his connections to russian spying ? 
   i think it 's because youths are a lot more exposed to ~ ~ news ~ ~ 4chan and reddit nowadays . 
   because the eu demands equal treatment of all its citizens in such matters , it says it is legally obliged to fight back . 
  suddenly it cares about visa rights of some easterners, 
   this is kremlins only way to deal with issues - ignore or discredit . 
  or simply kill the accuser, 
  inb4 trump learns this too, 
  it 's deleted, 
  link ? 
  the alt-dictators, 
  romanian administration workers also have the highest wages compared to other eastern/central eu states http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2016-11-15-21416532-0-salarii-publice.jpg and they keep getting raised now expect it to be greece 2.0 in a few years, 
  is it always like this or is it simply because theres 2 pro-russian candidates ? 
  you confuse macron with fillon i think, 
   the expats send home over 5 billion euro yearly more than any other foreign investments, 
   but tried to put it through the parliament . 
  they did n't do it yet though they said it stays in debate for 1 month plus there are new separate changes proposed now, 
  plus there are plenty other penal codes proposals now in parliament very similar to the ordinance or new but just as worse, 
  i 'm surprised the thread wasnt buried, 
  he was just their totem guy so they could say they are pro lgbt lmao and promoting a self hating gay meat hating on gays was ok, 
  so he 's the totem guy now like gay milo was, 
  circlebroke, 
  oh some youtuber is now reliable info, 
  someone needs a safe space, 
  thanks russia for encouraging nutjobs like him, 
  nope http://www.statecraft.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/peter%20kreko%20far%20left%20definitive.pdf in depth analysis here corbyn 's labourists and die linke are some examples, 
   all nazi parties leaders visit moscow to get money for nazi revanche yeah kinda https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/europe/right-wing-groups-find-a-haven-for-a-day-in-russia.html nazis of the world , unite !, 
  like the socialist international but this time on the other edge of the political spectrum, 
  ikr at one point all the scandals stop mattering these guys are way past that point she can go shoot a muslim and not drop 1 %, 
  basically confirmed then, 
  that would mean being russophobic , being a puppet of globalists and poking the innocent bear thats just defending its territory, 
  same way how they dont officially recognise transnistria but . . they kind of do in practice, 
   i mean , this is what happens when one candidate is literally invulnerable to scandals , like trump earlier https://giphy.com/gifs/xtin0gxhcwf1dy3hes, 
   its the first time i hear about him thats good he does seem to go largely unnoticed so far iirc he writes on adevarul.ro and thats pretty much all of his exposure, 
  yeah the damage is deeper than w/e trump does, 
   ~ ~ mussolini ~ ~ cheeto benito btw those are the elements of fascism , not just cults . 
   his supporters are pretty much a cult . 
  of the church of donald http://www.christianpost.com/news/ann-coulter-donald-trump-head-of-church-175214/, 
  saving this post to use later to break circlejerks, 
  / r/europe has a bunch of donald trolls here, 
  those in power tried to legalise corruption, 
  the same people protesting are mostly the same who voted and it includes voters of those in power, 
  and in a bunch of cases parliament voted against requests btw in the case of ex pm ponta the parliament blocked even the indictment request regarding some other accusations . 
  http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/solicitarea-dna-de-urmarire-penala-a-premierului-respinsa-de-plenul-camerei-ponta-crede-ca-votul-deputatilor-este-normal-si-vorbeste-de-apararea-oamenilor-simpli-14428831 https://euobserver.com/political/129023 iirc they have and still are trying to legalise conflict of interests, 
   tl ; dr : also they are trying to push the same changes but just by law through parliament now the pardons bill btw is still there, 
  that the people are illinformed ( it 's all just a communication problem from the gov ) that they are controlled by spooky intel services/prosecutors/soros / russians ( tho they side with the gov and are against the protesters ) / nazi president they are kinda mimmicking trump now by calling criticisms as fake news ( they went to washington recently and are really excited about him ), 
   is there any evidence that the hooligans were paid ? 
  paid no but it is clear that the dinamo fc 's owner ( or his brother , a mayor with big legal problems ) are the ones who organised them ( at a hotel owned by them or club facility and brought there by bus ) . 
  the owner 's wife recognised some of them and gave more details . 
   there are no leaders of the protesters here there is one guy seemingly interested in showing himself as leader and who is connected to the older network of crooks that is being fought against http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/protests-in-romania-continue-in-political-awakening-a-1134328.html  in the middle of the tumult on wednesday evening , slender and inconspicuous , stood sebastian burduja , 31 , one of the leaders of the protests , which do n't officially have a leader . 
  those inside , he said glancing at the government building , have to be tossed out : `` they are corrupt and no longer have our trust . '', 
  burduja is head of pact , a platform founded in 2016 by young activists demanding `` competent and clean governance . '', 
  when asked if he himself has political ambitions , burduja said : `` it 's not about me . 
  prestige does n't mean much to me . 
  but if i were called upon , i would accept . '', 
  most of them are far left their only problem is with western deals . 
  china , russia , anyone else are the good guys for them . 
  it will become similar to transnistria http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/08/01/how-the-russians-helped-turn-moldova-into-a-hotbed-for-money-laundering/#7966d1a32586, 
  are chinese courts that corrupt or what ? 
   and build an separate , non-us focued lattice of trade agreements likely with the same isds and similar mechanisms but the activists wont say a peep, 
  i can see russia and china teaming to play in a sort of bad cop / good cop scheme, 
  feels like deja-vu, 
   55 % upvoted why, 
   lavrov , offering pragmatic ties with the us , said : `` i hope that [ the world ] will choose a democratic world order - a post-west one - in which each country is defined by its sovereignty . '', 
  are ukraine or georgia part of this vision ? 
  or montenegro ? 
  the pm is now in bruxelles doing damage control , lieing . 
  more [ here ] ( https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine ) on how information is being weaponised in the social media age, 
   i see crimea as similar to kosovo by the way https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a3uovxv4wi&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=59s at the time of the kosovo intervention in 2008 , then russian president medvedev condemned it , saying that `` kosovo independence violates serbia 's sovereignty , is a violation of international law . '' http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/25/content_7669072.htm moscow thinks the unilaterally declared independence of kosovo violates serbia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and it is not in accordance with principles of international law , resolution1244 , the u.n. charter and the helsinki final act , '' medvedev said https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia's_reaction_to_the_2008_kosovo_declaration_of_independence, 
   e control over so called ` buffer states ' now this meanwhile russia supports antieu/nato groups in the eastern member states ( to get them to leave ) and then to further increase the buffer by applying the same thing it did in moldova , georgia and ukraine . 
  so this is like the smallest gesture he could make against russia, 
  he has business interests in russia https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-business.html enough to make him biased, 
  keep the sanctions then, 
  finally some sense in foreign trade, 
  thats just fearmongering bullshit the project ended anyway ( btw iirc the ` canadian firm ' had a romanian owning it ) romania already has ~ 80 deals with canada that include isds, 
   powerful nations do not care must be why there was and is so much damage control from russia russia stronk , huh you putinist http://i.imgur.com/uvfmtiy.png, 
   someone from under the rock nah its shit he prolly learned from rt http://i.imgur.com/not1dg2.png,
