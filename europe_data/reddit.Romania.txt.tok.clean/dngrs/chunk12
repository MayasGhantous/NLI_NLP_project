  details ? 
  what about iranians ? 
  what 's the name for rome there ? 
  the capital do poles see it as capital of gypsies ? 
  mmmm . . food . 
  we 've had ` how do you view country x ' and iirc some replies were from americans, 
  i do n't think there are any important ties between the 2 of you so you 're not picked for the study, 
  russians are alergic to nato, 
  polls like this are done on just a few countries it 's difficult to ask about all so they pick some relevant ones plus a few random, 
  well itar is state media, 
  did n't it start with hungary ? 
  kinda, 
  just concerned tourists, 
   putin incorrectly think the eu and us are weak maybe it is . 
  he is working on it anyway . 
  keep an eye on his friends in europe . 
  all he needs is to get more of them in power . 
  expect russia to grow a lot bolder after le pen wins in france . 
  was n't obama just visiting there yesterday ? 
  this is russia taunting . 
  it 's like : `` oh , obama coming there ?? 
  i 'm not afraid !!!, 
  look at this ! '', 
  azerbaidjan too ? 
  maybe if it was with a ` t ' fran ** \u021b ** a it 's like frantza, 
   if you guys want , it could eventually include non-european countries . 
  but most of those integrate so well they lose their ` gypsiness ', 
  yeah imagine dealing with a cop like that, 
  ours, 
   so , i would n't blame eastern orthodox church for all east europe problems . 
  in my opinion , romania , ukraine , russia , bulgaria and yugoslavia ( and later serbia ) have many ethnicities/cultures by country , that causes tensions and have configured the turbulent history of this part of europe . 
  it goes hand in hand with geography because lots of people came through here ( celts , goths , huns , cumans , turks , slavs , romans etc ) and some settled  existence of natural resources . 
  it seems like it 's usually a bad thing, 
  or maybe on one of the social sciences subs, 
  you sure ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal btw i 've read somewhere that the king here offered support but you declined and wanted france and uk to help instead . 
  that worked well . 
  changed your minds after that though / i mean after that you got the president , government , people in general , that bank gold out through here nazies complained much, 
  damn the czech dont like us either :\\ i do n't understand some of those names, 
  i want to see poll results done for turkey everybody actually, 
  it 's because russia is n't popular either and you were very close with them and alike for so long, 
   we are literally worse than ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ stalin . 
  historically ours are good with poles too most of them and us probably have no clue though, 
   and as far as i know the romania is believed ( i do n't know if it still true ) to be one of the biggest sources of human trafficing . 
  among eu countries ? 
  probably true generally most of it is from the balkans , excommie zones mainly . 
  ie moldova, 
  are you a fan of petre \u021au\u021bea ? 
  i think it was him or djuvara that talked about this . 
  are there polls like this done in turkey ? 
  yeah it 's got ta be more than that it 's weird because there 's no historical reason :\\ apparently, 
  is russia88 a neonazi name ? 
  lol, 
  orange is good , blue is n't . 
  maybe russia should be the one keeping finland happy . 
  you ca n't join nato without referendum, 
  conditions not right meaning nato summit going on currently, 
  but you see they arent terrorists they are just concerned citizens it is just their civic duty, 
  and morons still complain about nato, 
  it will be ready in 2015 i think, 
  i do n't really believe that . 
  anyway , we here already have 2 bases . 
  i wonder if you guys up north already have some too . 
  solution idea : ban twitter, 
   you ca n't force market like that . 
  not force them . 
  i thought it is common sense already . 
  long term it would be worth it . 
  to me it 's obvious that russia is n't reliable to trade with . 
  it ca n't really be profitable long term . 
   would you just feel safer . 
  that is what it is all about nato just has to ` do something ' for the people , not the governments , to see . 
   ** in case of war ** poland will be a battleground , whether there will be bases here or not , ** you could at least avoid bloodshed ** . 
  wo n't happen anyway, 
  i kinda expected netherlands to be higher, 
  is there work done to look for other markets ? 
  does it really deserve help ? 
  i suspected that there 's something about that but i could n't figure it out, 
  yeah it looks like it 's the best option to give up on it but the problem is that it makes kiev look bad http://pastebin.com/0txykswr if you cant see the article, 
   among most of the population , there is n't even a hint of intolerance between ukrainians and russians . 
  i do n't think it 's like that anymore . 
  just like in communism, 
  there 's no name at all on this site not even in about us and the site just looks amateurish, 
  i wonder what the song from 2:21 to 2:39 is it sounds very familiar :d ah [ cioc\u00e2rlia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pn1x1_a64 ), 
   / r/conspiracy or or / r/russia the same thing, 
  source ? 
  what a load of bullshit, 
  they just need an enemy this is it, 
  seems like it would be better to just give it up, 
  maybe a few in the balkans that maybe plan to join it anyway like montenegro , bosnia , macedonia, 
  it could use him to promote euroskepticism there, 
  all this threatening from putin makes him look desperate and worried, 
  does this guy have any connection with serge moscovici ? 
  but they do have plenty of the common sense he wants http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-09-01/more-sanctions-europe-will-ban-purchase-russian-bonds-however-russian-gas-exports-re sanctions : russian gas exports remain untouched, 
   i still believe they wo n't ban drugs import . 
  it is just too much , imho ... not if you get the media to tell people it 's the fascist degenerate west 's fault which they will probably buy and then you get more domestic support to go against that  the best solution to the current crisis is regime change in russia . 
  #putinmustgo very unlikely, 
  they officially didnt take it they dont actually recognise it they do with crimea now though, 
  some ideas 1 . reduce the us 's influence ( things that make it look bad like nsa spying on germany helps ) 2 . get western europe to agree or just not get involved ( ie germany not agreeing with having nato bases in the east is a sign of that ) just build ties with putinists , appeasers , all the useful idiots that see russia as an alternative . 
  3 . get politicians and media on his side .
