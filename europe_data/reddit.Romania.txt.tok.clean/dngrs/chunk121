  it 's not very likely that the usual russian state linked populist party , in this case pru ( lead by an ex socialdem , writer for voice of russia , turned far right overnight and promoted by most of the media controlled by the most corrupt ` mainstream ' politicians ) , will get into parliament there . 
  but anything can happen these days , anyway it may be just a small 5 % of votes . 
  it 's not about nostalgia . 
  the main aspects of those parties always were loyalty to their russian backers and antiwesternism . 
  socialism is the lower priority and these days just a propaganda tool . 
  this triggers the trolls, 
  it is, 
  +4 and 100 + comments :o this triggered all the kremlin apologists, 
  how does francois fillon stand on russia ? 
   the russians tipped him off apparently so they say but it may very well be a lie in support of another illiberal, 
  unless the alt-cons are still in power . 
  these guys like erdogan type politicians . 
  are akp fans redpillers ? 
  post trump win, 
  why is this so downvoted ? 
  lots of downvotes huh, 
  yet they got in power antiglobalist populists hahah, 
  the_donald users are very active here recently, 
   59 % upoted, 
  this is just damage control same with obama 's visit, 
  now they should check for bugs in their hq . 
  if they can . 
  hmm like isis, 
  there 's also a lot more russian spying going on . 
  i guess they work to gather dirt on journalists and turn them . 
  at least the middleman is cut now, 
  that reminds me of a certain orange guy . . 
  no , you 're right . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nils_u%c5%a1akovs#mayor_of_riga he 's just full of shit, 
   true , however the newer generations seem to be increasingly sympathetic towards putin 's russia , due to not bothering to inform themselves more deeply on recent history , and current politics and events , only reading into headlines . 
  it 's more because of poisonous trolling in social media . 
  youngsters rely too much just on that . 
  this guy was commissioner for energy between 2010-2014 when some big decisions were made in which russia had interest . 
  such drama itt lol, 
  suddenly / r/europe likes lobbyists nothing weird here, 
   every american i discusses this feared an eu army . 
  they could n't justify why but it is simple , a united europe would make the usa second not first among nations . 
  after voting to maga lmao, 
  projection ik, 
  ceausescu wiped about a quarter of historic bucharest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceau%c8%99ima, 
  they will make peace in our time, 
  you forgot the last one when they were drinking wine in crimea after the annexation http://www.lepanmedia.com/criminal-probe-launched-after-putin-berlusconi-wine-tasting/, 
  whats the corrupt about him ? 
  just askin, 
   whole leftist media spiegel isnt leftist . 
  wtf are you on about ? 
  for the * russian journalists * anything the neighbours do has parallels with nazi germany, 
  supporting crimea 's annexation and the sanctions lifting sounds really balanced, 
   are you suggesting it is wiser to trust a single news source no . 
  it 's just that some are a lot worse that others . 
  lmao, 
  it will make its local investigation too https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/, 
  the_donald stays active even after trump 's win but now as we see its for helping bring in power illiberals in the rest of the world too . 
  the global altright movement looks like the old socialist international to me . 
  how much money ? 
  it was fixed after the op was already made here, 
  you cant still indirectly support their interests even without the voters realising it . 
  look at poland and hungary . 
  there are ways to camouflage such actions . 
  actually tackling it does tho, 
  if even this isnt obvious trolling ... 
  its just a buzzword salad, 
  its doublespeak, 
  symbolically the meeting will be in yalta, 
  they are called gypsies because people mistook them for being from egypt, 
  roma or romani is some kind of indian term https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_romani_people#origin, 
  in romania both the pm and president are without doubt pro western and even reformists . 
  mainly sd and a party ( pru ) formed by an ex sd close to russia . 
  also the last president and his party are flipflopping and following them . 
  safe space, 
  i guess he wants to call for murders, 
   over 1/4 of swedish voters support a `` normalisation '' of refugee handling . 
  3/4 dont, 
  why is this downvoted, 
  there 's an addon or something that removes the comment section on yt https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/no-youtube-comments/ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-youtube-comments/kehdmnjmaakacofbgmjgjapbbibhafoh?hl=en, 
  he lost the popular vote . 
   le pen will probably lose the second round she only needs for sarkozy to be picked by his party, 
  at least people will have their feels for giving the middle finger to `` the system '', 
  again that bullshit kosovo just went independent and there was no bloodshed at all in crimea to warrant an intervention, 
  the usual stuff from agent corbyn, 
  even theguardian is worried about this, 
  https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/macron-s-scandi-solution-for-france-by-philippe-aghion-2017-05 so he 's actually on the left economically ? 
  why are some people panicking about this tho ? 
  cuz he 's far enough to the left ? 
   the sad part is that rm declared itself neutral through constitution and the local politicians constantly tell the local population that it is safe now , cause they are neutral by simply declaring it unilateraly . 
  we saw since the budapest memorandum that they do n't care about any law, 
   i doubt they dare an invasion . 
  nah it 's just another poorly veiled threat, 
   maybe we should just leave them alone from now on , see how they enjoy that . 
  they would still be blaming foreign forces anyway, 
  lmao, 
  lol there 's a huge circlejerk against saudis in every thread, 
  is whataboutism supposed to make it right ? 
  what happened to the tankie ` moral highground ' ? 
  and i wonder if he was allowed to enter if they would have still limited those imports would they have let supposed bad meat be consumed by their people ? 
  context http://www.politico.eu/article/snakes-russia-deputy-pm-dmitry-rogozin-romanian-authorities/, 
   people involved in the conversations also said the number of facebook accounts suspended in france for promoting propaganda or spam - much of it related to the election - had climbed to 70,000 , a big jump from the 30,000 account closures the company disclosed in april . 
  that 's quite a big operation . 
  apparently this is the group that organises this kind of stuff https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fancy_bear, 
  ayran is a soft drink ?
