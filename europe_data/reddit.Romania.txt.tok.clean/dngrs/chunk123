  `` they got up today and read that something is going on internationally . 
  if they are feeling patriotic they will start contributing , as they believe , to the justified fight against those speaking ill of russia . 
  is that possible ? 
  in theory , yes , '' he said . 
  he added : `` at the government level , we never engage in this . 
  this is what is most important . '' mr putin went on to say that he believed the real perpetrators could have disguised themselves to make it look like the attacks came from russia . 
  western security services believe the russian state was behind a series of hacks and cyber attacks against perceived opponents of the kremlin over recent years . 
  the alleged attacks include the hacking and leaking of emails from the democratic national convention during the us election campaign , in an apparent attempt to embarrass hillary clinton . 
  the same groups , which experts have said may be run by the fsb and gru spy agencies , have been accused of hacking the german parliament . 
  russian hackers were also blamed when a huge trove of emails from emmanuel macron 's campaign were leaked online ahead of the french presidential election last month . 
  however , the head of the french government 's cyber security agency said on thursday that no evidence of russian involvement in that attack had been found . 
  in an interview with the associated press , guillaume poupard said the macron campaign hack `` was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone . '', 
  us and japanese cyber security firms earlier linked the attack to a group known as advanced persistent threat 28 , fancy bear , or pawn storm , which is believed to have perpetrated the dnc attack and which some experts say is linked to the gru . 
  mr putin said during a meeting with mr macron in versailles on monday that the allegations were `` not based on facts . '' cyber security and espionage experts say that russia has in the past `` outsourced '' its hacking efforts to criminal groups .

  is he in europe to buy another vacation house ? 
  pfew, 
  thats incentive for orban to convinces his peers to push east many people with influence there probably still lean western mostly because of the funding they can steal but cut that and the interest is gone, 
   ps , senators and members of local authorities will be forbidden from standing for reelection to the same position more than once , so 2 mandates limit ? 
  now imagine what le pen would be doing instead ... 
  gee i wonder why he tries that, 
  the government kicked them , not the president . 
  it say so in the article and the president criticised the move http://tass.com/world/948338, 
  it might have something to do with spying suspicions knowing recent scandals the pm said it was done after a report by their intelligence service, 
   if there 's something romanians like , it 's some nice wood to work on . 
  wasnt peles built by a german tho ? 
  to his tastes, 
  which makes sense merkel ca n't deal with putin as well as macron because russia has a lot more leverage in germany than in france . 
  think of ie the verstehers . 
  and for trump and his special fanbase it looks bad dealing with a woman . 
  lol, 
   and avoiding to fall into `` anti-russian '' rhetoric . 
  it can still be spinned by those who want to, 
  ooh the scary / r/neoliberal, 
  finally someone with influence to tell it like it is, 
  recently there has been an overlap in user base, 
  wow that is crazy thanks , le pen !, 
  polls showed trumpvich losing and he did in the popular vote but not as much as expected . 
  even fox 's and breitbart 's polls showed him losing . 
  and apparently le pen would have lost even harder if they had a system like in the us, 
   give the uk 10 to 20 years and they will want to get back in . 
  either that or they will lose scotland, 
  and these https://i.redd.it/39gcrk2ns4wy.png https://i.redd.it/47o4cyji45wy.jpg, 
  hahha glorious, 
  cuz of the name / pol/and, 
  it 's why russia backs this kind of movement . 
  they bet on people like you to react like that and fragment . 
   but are they regimes ? 
  more like fake dictatorships, 
   nobody cares about khodorkovsky in russia . 
  it 's funny how you hear the same exact line regarding any opposition figure in russia ( left alive ) same line for navalny in every damn thread, 
  it 's also delaying the inevitable, 
  so the title is misleading ? 
  hold my sheep, 
   by encircling russia with ** battlesheeps **, 
   when you can ~ ~ have sheeps ~ ~ invest in battlesheep ? 
  are the sheep the baddies ? 
  the freighter took only minor damage . 
  seriously . 
  lol, 
  i 'm surprised they did n't threaten with ww3 and muh nukes cuz of that . 
  mkay, 
  something similar was done a few years ago in france by a far right politician http://www.politico.eu/article/ex-national-front-official-jailed-burning-cars/, 
  so which montenegran wine should i look to buy ? 
  by : murad ahmed in london and michael stothard in paris french prosecutors are investigating the bidding process behind the 2018 and 2022 world cups , the latest international investigation to target fifa , the scandal-hit organisation that governs world football . 
  france 's national public prosecutor 's office has been examining the bids for the tournaments , which were awarded to russia and qatar . 
  former fifa president sepp blatter has also been questioned over the matter . 
  fifa and representatives for mr blatter did not immediately respond to requests for comment . 
  a person close to the prosecutor 's office said that it had opened a preliminary investigation last year into `` bribery '' , `` criminal association '' and `` influence trafficking '' relating to the 2018 and 2022 world cups . 
  mr blatter was questioned on april 20 . 
  fifa 's reputation has suffered over the past two years after becoming the subject of investigations by us and swiss authorities into alleged criminal misconduct and bribery , leading to dozens of arrests of former officials . 
  the activity is alleged to have occurred under the tenure of mr blatter , who resigned as president in 2015 and has been replaced by gianni infantino . 
  under new leadership , fifa has sought to portray itself as the victim of corruption by its officials . 
  it has offered to co-operate fully with official investigations on both sides of the atlantic while enacting reforms to prevent any future misdeeds . 
  earlier this month , fifa handed swiss public prosecutors a mass of files from its own internal investigation as the body attempts to show it is cleaning up its past . 
  the fifa investigation has been led by us law firm quinn emanuel , which has attempted to aid prosecutors with information including on bank transactions and additional witnesses . 
  industry figures have said the reputational damage that fifa has suffered in recent years helps to explain why the group has not been able to secure key sponsorship and broadcast deals for the russia 's world cup . 
  world football 's governing body lost several major sponsors , including sony and emirates , when their deals ended at the end of the previous tournament in 2014 . 
  for the 2018 tournament in russia , fifa has 10 companies signed up as sponsors , but before the 2014 tournament in brazil , the organisation had 20 corporate partners on board . 
  meanwhile , a consortium of russia 's main state-run tv channels has been unable to agree a price for the local broadcast rights to screen the tournament . 
  its the same bs logic with the eastern sanctions, 
  there are local alde leaders in romania that have very different views from what you 'd expect from politicians in verhofstad 's group . 
  fidesz and orban had different views back then, 
  maybe an eurasian one ? 
  the more time passes by with him in power the more euroskeptic hungary becomes, 
  at this point that would make him too much of a martyr, 
   those less convinced include italy , greece , cyprus , hungary , spain and bulgaria , who argue that three years of sanctions have failed to sway moscow , and would like to restore business ties . 
  how did russia gain leverage over spain ? 
  idk i guess it 's an important export at least for georgia and moldova in particular so if you hit them then you press the wine businesses to pressure their governments to back off, 
  surprise surprise guess why the european far right doesnt care about this particular kind of immigration btw, 
  yep 1991-2010 2 decades worth of data, 
  with redpillers maybe, 
  yeah lol this looks kinda . . dare i say . . globalist !, 
  cuz of secessionism i guess no scotland either, 
  how relevant is nova24tv ? 
  does this flipflop have anything to do with le pen 's ? 
  spasiba, 
  i ca n't give you gold but you can have this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hero_of_the_soviet_union#/media/file:red_star.png,

   this may not be popular to hear but the protectionist/isolationist/nationalist attitudes held by trump , le pen and their supporters are basically the norm in africa and the middle east .
