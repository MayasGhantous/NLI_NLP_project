  the media is highly biased so if you get the politicians ( by bribe and blackmail which ca n't be hard here ) then you get the media too . 
  looks like it 's already working in some countries . 
  they want to trade more with the eu too though and they have interest in eastern ukraine for agriculture, 
  i wonder if they will fight against each other there hmm i think i know why ours are n't joining this, 
  she 's just pretending, 
  from slavic ljubiti most or all of our love words are slavic like dragoste, 
   but those channels who spread government propaganda are better because they give you the official stand of the state . 
  how is fox giving you the official stand of the state ? 
  their bias is with republicans and they are n't the ones in power and fox is a private firm btw, 
  you just get heavy mix of lies there is no middle ground that way i really ca n't understand this thinking, 
  you should be trekking brasov or mountain villages then  ) all the bears now go there, 
  btw there are bear watching things organised there are special little high `` houses '' where tourists go with some kind of guide and there they wait to see bears, 
  moldova 's all green . 
  underrated wine there . 
  august is over . 
  they got at least a year to prepare . 
  be more cautious and it will be ok . 
  china has some deals in that area too . 
  is green best ? 
  a bit more than a nationalist ie this is his creation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_g%c3%a1rda he 's basically a little putler, 
  i really do n't like that 30mb upload limit they have . 
  the neighbourhood networks do n't do that ( 100/100m ) . 
  i miss my old isp . 
  yeah not anymore maybe work on some kind of intermarium but we 'd be weak in the middle without cz/s/h, 
   it appears putin is willing to essentially bankrupt russia for the sake of his own ego . 
  and the russian people 's . 
  so often it is forgotten that most of them do support him and his kind of mentality . 
  all thats missing from v4 there is poland, 
  140 % in favor !, 
   the ruins of a medieval tavern were unearthed near targovishte .

  can we join pls, 
  this is * almost * funny, 
  is there a beer tap in the schools for kids too ? 
  romtelecom 's internet sucks anyway and cosmote is mainly or just a phone company actually romtelecom 's 100mbps is still 10 euros but you have to get a phone sub too and they also give a free wifi router it 's just that most networks are better, 
  it does n't really work short term the problem is what will putler do in this window until we get other sources of energy ? 
  he has at least a few years time , maybe the rest of this decade . 
  [ negoiu peak ] ( http://www.natureflip.com/sites/default/files/attraction-photo/negoiu-peak/negoiu-peak-negoiu-and-neighbouring-peaks-are-covered-snow-october-june.jpg ) 2535 most of the top peaks are in that area of [ f\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 mountains ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c4%83g%c4%83ra%c8%99_mountains#image_gallery ), 
  i think that in time russia will only become more of a problem . 
  good enough ty, 
  nice post +1  former prime minister , adrian nastase freed again - released from jail for good conduct , barred from politics for 9 years . 
  this guy said he ` remains the same ' and that he has offers from multinationals and foreign governments to be their advisor he talked about pardon and tax amnesty bills , criticised the prison system ( he made many friends there and spoke to them about freemasonry among other subjects , he was one ) , parliament and changing the elections law i think he will probably still play a role in our politics / / / oh and n\u0103vodari town psd mayor was detained ( released today i think ) . 
  he 's investigated for corruption and the townhall 's damages are worth over 20m in euros in april he got 3.5 years for bribery but it 's not final and that 's in a different case, 
  you gon na have to kick hungary out first, 
  is there a written list too ? 
  i do n't know all the map, 
  are n't the saudis actually supporting them ? 
  you think putin is leftwing ? 
  can they give permission again later ? 
  damn, 
  not where it matters most as seen before, 
  i rather have sikorski too, 
  just criticism, 
  there no way for poland to get both that and fm , right ? 
  go for temporary 99 years, 
  link ? 
   the whole situation needs more diplomacy , dialogue and generally a more nuanced approach from what is happening right now . 
  that 's incredibly naive . 
  yeah no doubt, 
   romania europe 's software development ** powerhouse ** . . wut ? 
  bs  microsoft 's romanian arm , for instance , starts its messaging very early , talking to hundreds of children and teenagers in schools about the benefits of legal software . 
  btw they are investigated in a recent case about the state buying licenses from them bribes of millions of euros and ex ministers and mps have been called to hearings so it 's a big case, 
  oh good russia banned that , right ? 
  kosovo sending you a machine gun, 
  calls putin what ? 
  i cant find anything, 
  he 's already very sure, 
  and some westerners, 
  there 's are lots of people that buy the russian view, 
  for who ? 
  yeah it looks like it 's too late now putler won, 
  he actually said this is not a invasion . 
  yes more of the same that showed it does not work, 
  just russian tourists they got lost, 
  how does the media stand on this ? 
   putin wants back control over ukraine , or at least prevent the emergence of a successful , democratic , western-oriented neighbour . 
  yeah because then russians will more easily see how that is and start geting ideas, 
  maybe try on / r/geopolitics, 
  meaning after she gets instructions from putler, 
  it just got lost and ended up there by accident, 
  and then the scum built these http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom, 
  idiots, 
  this is cheaper than russia 's gas btw ( does anyone exactly know the difference ? ), 
  next is an electrical energy link after 2019 ( there 's a lot of gas in our part of the black sea and we need to start production there first ) we 're gon na be a nett exporter of energy and we already have something planned with hungary , bulgaria and some other countries in our region . 
  the article missed that today is their independence day and they probably waited for this to coincide for the inauguration, 
  as expected, 
  he has putin 's protection so merkel wo n't do shit . 
  btw a deputy ( bogdan deaconu ) recently left the sd party and said he will form a nationalist party it seems antimagyar he 's a writer for voiceofrussia so . . it 's interesting, 
  i 'm kinda expecting him to do a 180 after he wins . 
  have you considered leaving the country ? 
  vlach magic, 
  the us i guess, 
  yeah he does n't care because those do not have the right to vote in russia that is all that really matters, 
  i always forget this guy was in politics, 
  http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2014-01-29/crisis-ukraine-first-step-towards-compromise ? 
  it does n't seem to be it, 
  wtf she really said this ? 
  i doubt hungary too,
