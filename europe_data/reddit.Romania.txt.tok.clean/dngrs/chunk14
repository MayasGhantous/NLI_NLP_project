   russia can overwhelm any shield . 
  details ? 
  yes please, 
  add / r/balkanmusic, 
  maybe it was renamed since then, 
  wtf its actually called like this is this for real ? 
  yeah drug use is n't popular here, 
  is there anything about him or yateniuk speaking romanian in ukrainian media ? 
  maybe it 's for people 's morale, 
  may 10 1877 or 78 independence from turks it also means royalty day ( carol came to power in 1866 ) and the day the kingdom was created ( 1881 ) it actually goes pretty unnoticed , not that much festivity . 
  before communism it used to be the national day some politicians want to put the national day ( 1 dec ) back on 10th, 
   poroshenko thanked merkel for her support of the ukrainian people and for promised german and eu financial assistance to rebuild war-torn eastern ukraine . 
  yea thx this isnt his first case in the last one he got acquited, 
  our guy is being investigated for money laundering and some other things some state officials ( even ex ministers ) too, 
  and homogay, 
  maybe just for beer, 
  this is incredibly stupid, 
  a sheep, 
  i never had mead . 
  how is it like ? 
  7.7 in norway what do you guys drink there usually ? 
  for you both plural and singural it 's [ dumneavoastr\u0103 ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dumneavoastr%c4%83 )  from domnia , from domn , from latin dominus ( `` master '' ) + voastr\u0103 , from latin voster ( `` you '' ), 
  learn what ? 
  their audience buys it so do n't expect this to stop, 
  they are probably sending to northern iraq where the kuds are . 
  then i wonder which media released this first, 
  not well known, 
  is the story in german media ? 
  it 's more than a warning it blocks/slows their progress in integrating with the west especially nato that 's the goal, 
   `` smarter one backs down '' we have it too : cel mai de\u015ftept cedeaz\u0103, 
  we have this : `` g\u0103ina b\u0103tr\u00e2n\u0103 face ciorba bun\u0103 '' meaning the old hen makes the soup good, 
  maybe gymnastics for 3rd, 
  unpopular sport though you hardly get more than 1 or 2 thousand people to come watch the nt play it 's a common problem though few people in general come to stadiums, 
  not for our potential i mean normally we should be much better, 
  why should i care about that ? 
  did some googling for you http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%e2%80%9315_uefa_europa_league#group_stage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%e2%80%9315_uefa_champions_league#group_stage 3 or 4 teams, 
  instead of playing against top clubs we go against ludogoret :\\ we do suck at club level . 
  we do n't even go straight into group stage ffs . 
  not really, 
  they are on about the same level imo . 
  it 's because one was executed and that 's kinda like punishment while the other one is still breathing , not jailed and even honorary president of `` socialdems '', 
  1 . football 2 . football 3 . football even though we are kinda shit at it, 
  i do n't think there 's an obvious figure like that here . 
  they have been tougher but just far from enough, 
  less bad , yeah , but good ? 
  looks like a head with a hand in it 's mouth, 
  he 's joking, 
  `` capitalism '', 
  we got lots of morons that like ceausescu and the communist period, 
  how do you build stuff on meteora ? 
  my guess is that the postcommunist politicians were n't really anticommunist ( the revolution does look a bit like a coup , mineriads , politicians with interesting history ) and that they did n't care to check the past much in fear of what might be discovered and what this might encourage now most prison guards are dead while the rest are in their 80s so they are n't important any more these guys might die before they are sentenced because our trials tend to take very long time to finish, 
   how many of them was sentenced after 1989 ? 
  none i think, 
  here it seems like nobody is prorussian . 
  media , average people , politicians ( i 'm a bit wary of the ` left ' on this ), 
   even the nazi 's had a plan to move 1/3 of netherlands population to ukraine to get agriculture production up there . 
  details ? 
   we 'll take loans from you  like croatia did . 
  dies too *, 
  a living legend, 
  turn them orthodox and get them moved to romania they 'll do really well here, 
  we import little from them and actually i think we are n't even using any right now . 
  some fertiliser factories or something are turned off . 
  there is also some searching for gas in the black sea and other areas so i 'm sure we will get rid of imports . 
  what a bastard, 
  cute, 
  i do n't understand . 
  how are we a victim ? 
  i do n't find polls ordered by russian state press reliable, 
   bulgaria , serbia , hungary and ** romania ** are described as the biggest victims of plan b. but it is n't planned to go through there too, 
  yep http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/17/us-ukraine-crisis-breedlove-iduskbn0gh0jf20140817, 
  yeah i 'd like to see some kind of intermarum military alliance between countries from the baltics all the way down to turkey, 
  yes kurds with good nato gear and training, 
   the ones saying that probably he 's an undercover nazi spy ( there 's a lot of people thinking that ) i think it 's just the pro-ponta media acting a bit like he 's ` an agent of germany ' or something like that it does try very hard to show him as a ` foreigner ' even though he 's born here and btw ponta is part albanian ( and part russian ), 
  ties with russia are too advantageous for countries like germany so it wo n't happen . 
  http://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/kommentare/essay-in-englisch-the-west-on-the-wrong-path/v_detail_tab_print/10308406.html  angela merkel can hardly claim these mitigating circumstances for herself . 
  geography forces every german chancellor to be a bit more serious . 
  as neighbors of russia , as part of the european community bound in destiny , as recipient of energy and supplier of this and that , we germans have a clearly more vital interest in stability and communication this is the thinking, 
  they 'd have to beat the kurds first which looks unlikely, 
  i do n't have much trust in political polls especially in the ones that get promoted by very biased media like that and when elections are close . 
  i think it will be a tight race unless the other `` right wing '' candidates keep attacking iohannis because it will make it more difficult to beat psd in the 2nd round . 
  religion is always very important especially for psd ie candidates generally never miss going to church events especially near elections day . 
  2 problems 1 . a win for moscow 2 . people care about it so it matters in elections and it could boost the communist party much ( bigger win for moscow ), 
  i found more that ai n't real http://imgur.com/a/qfs4e, 
  this ai n't real . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism ? 
  [ found a chavmobile ] ( http://www.gocitygirl.com/fashionimages/1_16461704_30b9c6a879.jpg ), 
  we 're sending them kalashnikovs i think, 
  protv sucks try mediafax , digi24 and agerpres at least the last one is state media btw, 
  dont u check the . ro sites ? 
  or our sub, 
  so little monies, 
   mont-saint-michel it 's built by normands , right ? 
   sighi\u015foara vlad \u021aepe\u0219 lived there when he was little and it 's possible that he was born there, 
  or just yurop, 
  4.5 at carrefour, 
  that 's an ox-heart tomato i think why is it pink in the first pic ? 
  yeah that 's what i think, 
  yeah they eat dick :d no really it 's because it 's made with this http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/kurtoskalacs_szentivanlaborfalva1.jpg,
