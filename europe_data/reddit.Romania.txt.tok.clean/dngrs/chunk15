  wtf, 
  i see german flair so you should check out [ shantel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shantel ) if you do n't already know about him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_v8ihontkq, 
  you mean germany ? 
  how 's the coverage of the ukrainian events in mainstream serbian press who 's side is it on ? 
  serbia wants to join the eu first so it 's balancing carefully . 
  after that i 'd be surprised if belgrade does n't turn even more putinist than budapest . 
  i mean paramilitary stuff . 
  a moldovan ex intelligence chief said so . 
  hard to pick really lately i got into gipsy music so i 'll go with this one ( the cimbalom part is typically romanian ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuaxdgttsw8 btw / r/balkanbrass / r/balkanmusic, 
  btw i 've read that agitators are trained in serbia, 
  but the fault is the nazi eurogays ' so it will be accepted anyway i bet they will support a trade war for longer than the homogays so it 's really a game of who blinks first, 
  me neither, 
  it looks true in this case though, 
  you forget that most of them actually support him, 
   halligan is a regular pundit on rt , the russian state 's english-language satellite channel , ... gives a voice to . . people who believe the pope is part of a species of cone heads that secretly rule the world . 
  i wonder if the kremlin is supporting nwo propaganda, 
  that is more like poland 's paczki, 
  he is talking about buhti, 
  you mean putin cant ? 
  so they are building ties him for nothing ? 
  you can use bulgaria 's pic for us old people go ** mad ** when a new store is opened and there are discounts, 
  because the eu is led by people like http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dluo0/angela_merkel_warns_against_severity_of_russian/ and then are the really obvious putinists like orban, 
  or they just dont care anymore shows how confident they are, 
   this is what the new europe is about , cowardice , avarice and decay , and putin knows it . 
  yep this was his bet all along, 
  it 's the azeri kind i think, 
  we have pakhlava ( something similar ) , mekitsi but made without yoghourt ( called turti\u015foare ) and eaten with cheese and garlic sauce , p\u0105czki  gozinaki i did n't know you can fry stuff in honey mamaliga again wtf even weirder this time so [ add this \u00cenv\u00e2rtita moldoveneasc\u0103 ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ndiijmcr8pq/txqcmgwcsmi/aaaaaaaaak0/zvtkaqhahb4/s1600/invartita+moldoveneasca+cu+nuca+%25283%2529.jpg ) [ more realistic pic of a cheese pl\u0103cint\u0103 ] ( http://www.retetecalamama.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/placinta-cu-branza-ca-la-mama.jpg ), 
  georgian ? 
  \u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0437\u0430 might actually be from the dacians btw it 's interesting that you have it the other one is from latin mamilla and everybody has it from us - hmm the french wiki 's article on this is bigger than our own  ) weird, 
  we all make mistakes sometimes, 
  nope , less than a quarter of it . 
  i have n't been in any other country yet . 
  it 's not weird because we have lots of other influences : slavic , magyar , turkish , german . 
  that 's why it 's harder for them to understand . 
  he can check pronouncements on www.forvo.com, 
  i guess it ca n't be worse than what the media shows so it * has * to be a positive surprise . 
  do it like this guy  ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badea_c%c3%a2r%c8%9ban, 
  nobody answered my question :d, 
  it actually looks like a good option this time tbf, 
  and after that there will be protests again and the chance to get proputin politicians in power again . 
  if there was an order for that then it may have came from higher up than igor . 
  njet, 
  do n't you add meat to that ? 
  banned from / r/romania, 
  we all know the proper word is mititei, 
  i really like that khachapuri, 
  looks just like our pl\u0103cint\u0103 dobrogean\u0103, 
  lettuce and carrots ... wut ? 
  heresy, 
  or make it in balls with cheese in the middle and then grill it called [ bulz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulz_%28food%29 ), 
  all of these look tasty and ... im hungry now some are common here too : fasolada ( also the ' 2nd meal ' type one with smoked meat like tav\u010de grav\u010de ) , gulas in some areas , dolma and other variations , bigos , . . mamaliga :\\ that 's just a side thing like bread pick [ mici ] ( http://vilaursutismana.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/meniu-mici.jpg ) instead like serbia 's not sure about banitsa but it looks familiar, 
   the point is that everybody does their own pr moves . 
   when the country gets back on its feets and the incomes raise , many people move back . 
  even if their new countries get in severe economic problems they still wo n't come back ( not many moving back from spain ie / it may be seen as a failure or something idk why . . 
  i guess being unemployed there is still better than returning here which may actually be true ) and the few that will are gon na be just the pensioners, 
  it 's not that praised here partly because the tsar suddenly wanted land from us after we kicked the turks out . 
  he was the one asking for assistance in the first place btw . 
  / u/grevenas is right, 
  haha i bet the irredentists here ( some went to ukraine in that transkarpatia region to support their movement there btw ) also think that putin will help them, 
  we also have much smaller countries so it 's easier to deal with us, 
   first they ~ ~ play nice and trustworthy ~ ~ bribe you, 
  you go to war against the ice, 
  yes was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_romania, 
  yeah, 
  they recognise kiev 's authority when it suits them and now it does not homogay nazis , remember ? 
   the romanian monarchs are hapsburgs they are n't since 2011  the castle probably never had anything to do with vlad the impaler , it 's just marketed that way . 
  yep, 
  that was fake iirc,

  [ gipsy towers ] ( http://alpinet.org/foto/2008/09/09/ywiwoty3zmiynmviodnjzmu1n2rlmgu5mdcznje0njfoto_77091.jpg ) are we supposed to not post man made stuff ? 
  if anybody cares here are lots more pictures http://www.romanian-explorer.com/en-index.html some here too http://romaniatourism.com/ btw / r/romaniaporn, 
  it might happen eventually but probably not with the same countries in it like now ( besides the uk exit issue ) and i am all for it !, 
  it 's very unlikely for china to go against the eu or us its incredibly difficult for it to sacrifice its economic interests with eu/us to please russia for which it does not really care that much about, 
  yes he was an elf actually he was born here, 
  yeah lots left from here trivia : ariel sharon 's parents were from belarus and he married twice with romanians ( . . sisters iirc ), 
  this should show the common police cars, 
  just a few years ago in our case, 
  the problem is when they cut your supply because you dont kiss putin 's ass, 
  it 's 50/50 in polls, 
  not easy to pick but i 'll go with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eflpsfjkzxu the original is this i think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh2xeyyhrwu there 's also a nice violin cover https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pn1x1_a64 or on flute https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5foui-jqpc cioc\u00e2rlia means the lark http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cioc%c3%a2rlia_%28l%c4%83ut%c4%83resc_tune%29, 
  i thought the kennedys are like royalty there :d, 
  which is kinda the point look what happens when you have both pm and president with powers the other alternative is parliamentary republic but the thing is elections are way too bad ... 
  i do n't like ** all ** that ` democracy ', 
  afaik it will cover it all after a few years, 
   but it requires a good monarch . 
  just less bad than presidents, 
  north africa i think ie algeria, 
  looks like there is room for us to pay more, 
  i know ferdinand wanted to separate houses . 
  yep most of them are like that hell there 's a special genre for sad songs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doina https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws5wp1lhguc, 
  this guy is also suspected to have some weird connections with intelligence services, 
  give them free fish and chips, 
  one could say they are putin 's instead, 
  i guess they were prepared, 
  hitler is back !,
