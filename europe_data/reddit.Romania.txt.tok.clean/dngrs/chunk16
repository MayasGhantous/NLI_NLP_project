   the antena 3 tv station the headquarters and it has not happened because of voiculescu sold those to another firms of his and the state has to get that contract canceled or something like that to seize the hqs btw it will get seized because voiculescu used some ica land to get a loan from a bank for that hq, 
  they wo n't really get rid of them all because some are connected with people on all sides like that deputy who has an ongoing 12 year old case sebastian ghita ( psd ) who is another little media mogul, 
  few of them and their cases go slower, 
  i mean there 's not half as much interest in targeting the ones around the president, 
  which is good enough . . for now anyway the thing is that the ones who take over that power hopefully wont do the same exact thing though id be happy with that too really, 
  cant you have one of the kennedys, 
  this constitutional monarchy is best long term especially for more unstable countries, 
  vampire, 
  which means what ? 
   michael i ( hohenzollern-sigmaringen ) huh i think he 's no longer of hohenzollern ( since 2011 ) trivia : he 's a great-great-grandson of queen victoria of the united kingdom through both of his parents , and a third cousin of queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom , he is the last surviving monarch from the interbellum and the oldest of only three surviving heads of state from world war ii , the others being the former king simeon ii of bulgaria and tenzin gyatso , 14th dalai lama of tibet interesting post btw and in that pic he is sitting in one of the parliament rooms where he held a speech a few years ago http://royalromania.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/rege_25oct11_-80.jpg?w=640 ( this is where our crooks usually nap if they even show up there at all ), 
  the children of the night, 
  feed them your own blood !, 
  btw the mines in transylvania even today still attract interest http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabriel_resources, 
  there are lots of mountains and forests in slovenia so it 's to be expected that they have wolves, 
  you can have some of our wolves if you want take some bears too, 
  it 's not just a feeling there are lots of crooks on all sides, 
  yeah they are definitely very controversial, 
  im guessing these are the ones that do not want to openly move into ukraine, 
  no i do n't think so it 's owned by intact media group, 
  he seems to have some ties with the anticorruption agency boss ( and some people from magistrates ' court ) but they do target ** a few ** politicians who are n't in opposition to him . . at least for giving the appearance of not being biased i 'm not really suspicious of how judges treat these cases btw, 
  oh my god he ate steamed cabbage he is such a man of the people, 
   i do want to know from you however if you feel that people who are close to basecsu are not being targeted ? 
  they are i mean there are much fewer cases involving them ( most politicians investigated are from pnl , psd , unpr , pc so not really from basescu 's group ) ie videanu ( ex minister ) and the guy that was chief of the fiscal agency the more important ones like exminister udrea and expm boc are somehow safe i 'm still happy with all this, 
   autonomy is not separatism . 
  it 's still one giant step towards it it 's political suicide for any politician to support that especially now with hungary going putinist, 
  wtf :\\ he has good ties with the main magyar party did you know that ? 
  the problem is with * some * magyars that really are separatists like tokes not even udmr get along well with these guys, 
  maybe this en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snake_island_ ( black_sea ) #maritime _ delimitation ten million tonnes of oil and a billion cubic meters of natural gas deposits were discovered under the seabed nearby . 
  click main article too, 
  one explanation would be that we turned more prowest so the countries more tied to moscow ( like ukraine was ) did n't keep good relations, 
   in romania if something goes wrong you 'll instantly get the hungarians out of the hat . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   romania , because of the anti-magyar politics . 
  if we are antimagyar , how exactly are you ? 
  do you realise magyars here are a billion times better treated than romanians in hungary ? 
  / r/romania leaking, 
  they criticise barroso , merkel and van rompuy or w/e a lot because they supported the president during the impeachment referendums but in general all mainstream media is n't antieu, 
  to get an idea how bad a3 is : the director there is investigated for blackmail ( iirc he threatened a cable director to use media attacks on his company or something like that ) he was even detained for a couple of weeks or so, 
  even so it does n't mean this bastard doesnt deserve his sentence, 
  no , ofc not . 
  this is the 2nd media mogul sentenced [ first one ( another very shady character - fni ponzi scheme in the 90s and his 3 years sentence was prescribed , informant of securitate - it 's interesting how some of the very influencial people here have ties with it ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorin_ovidiu_v%c3%a2ntu ) was sentenced once for blackmail of another media mogul and another time for money laundering and embezzlement worth 83 mil euros, 
   antena3 ( cnn international affiliate they ** love ** to brag about this this media group is probably the strongest here and clearly very biased . 
  currently progovernment and the pm supports them very much even now . 
  i like gifs so i made my own collection . 
  the one above isnt mine btw / r/rogifs, 
  hahaha you have no clue hmm you made a new account just for this, 
  love the antwerp station looks like tourists go east mostly to see churches, 
  big cases take forever to be finished ( this bastard in particular is amazing at delaying this ) and they often get prescribed there 's a deputy with a case that 's almost 12 years old, 
  but we dont even sell to them :d, 
  i do n't think we import much from russia either . 
  dunno eu citizens are much more easy to piss off than russia 's, 
  so you get an idea how much that is here : it 's worth about 3 kent cigar packs, 
  i do n't think we export much foodstuff to russia . 
  we 're mainly an importer btw . 
  quickly find some bad news because balance must be restored !, 
  maybe including eu 's too, 
  www.digi24.ro the rest of the mainstream media is pretty biased , some being a lot like foxnews . 
  to brag on reddit and a new hard drive is enough or actually ssd i think . . if it 's compatible, 
  come on , i like rain !, 
  on paper , building is n't finished yet . 
  ** it was n't really a priority ** ** the state just ignored it so it developed wildly which happenened to be a great thing **, 
  wan na trade countries ? 
  what makes you think that people here that make money from sex cam pay taxes ? 
  rds 's hd cable ( only 20 hd channels with ~ 100 normal digital ones ) with hbo is 8.5 euros, 
  yes yes all that copper, 
   really poor with very fast internet, 
  [ party !, 
  judging by flags most but not all are of kiev 's troops, 
  lolwut :d  or am i completely wrong . 
  how can romania be number 1 ? 
  sometimes when the planets align we get to be really good at something, 
  1000 mbps for 12 euros, 
  we used to have many , many neighbourhood networks in the 90s, 
   putting up trade barriers on food and other necessities is an infallible way to screw your own people . 
  and thanks to propaganda the politicians will get just more and more support people already know all is the west 's fault, 
  i wonder if the eu will try to make it easier to buy from belarus or something like that . 
  never seen it before i think most are like this www.iubescmoldova.ro/files/9913/8702/6115/troleu_n_romnia.jpg http://ratb.stfp.net/data/l/i/5261-61:8.jpg, 
  that 's the bad kind and it really is a lot like gangsta rap ( same lyrics , same video style ) the good gipsy music is like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-7w4-dlfea / r/balkanbrass most people here actually like that manele crap and know little of the good stuff ( hell , it 's better known outside the country than here ), 
   `` political instruments of pressure on the economy are unacceptable , they contradict all norms and rules , '' putin hypocrite, 
   and does not represent anywhere near the majority of hungarians . 
  didnt ukraine support transnistria until recently ? 
  yeah thats right partly because of the soviet times propaganda, 
  20s or 30s i 've heard that the 1870s and 1950s ( or 1960s ) were kinda nice too, 
  politics happens, 
  you mean astroturfing ? 
  yeah but it probably wont, 
  it looks to me like change will either have to come from the youth ( which is why russia is focusing much on censoring the internet ) or an outside force which looks really difficult, 
  yeah similar thing : one of the reasons why russia keeps bullying moldova is to discourage others still under it 's influence from geting ideas, 
  http://romanian.ruvr.ru/ have fun loading is bad . . maybe it 's infected with the homogay virus ? 
  you want alcohol too ? 
  kek nothing left for you to post all the karma to meeee ~ !, 
  no worries you 'll get opportunities to fuck up like us too :d, 
  you could have wrote below me, 
  meaning : the intelligence chief does n't think even for a second what will happen if washington does n't answer the phone ? 
  what will happen if during winter the gas is gone ( 20 % of the 20 % we import is from russia which is little and we have reserves ) and the americans say ` deal with it urselves ' and move along with their own business ? 
  what will happen if inside romania an enclave will form that doesnt recognise bucuresti 's authority ? 
  ( refering to the szekler separatists - this is one of the reasons why orban gets along so well with putin , common interests involving us . 
  hungary has a historic tendency to ally with russia against us ) what will happen if a civil war starts in the rep. of moldova and gagauzia ( turkish orthodox autonomous region there ) is recognised as an independent state by russia and turkey ? 
  ( btw russia doesnt officially recognise transnistria ) what will happen if the 2nd crisis wave hits and germany decides to leave all weak european countries to die ? 
  kremlin wants either ukraine to support w/e interests it has or to damage it so to make it hard for them to integrate west ( ie ca n't join nato ) they try that by ` transnistrianizing ' parts of ukraine another example : its one of the reasons why we cant reunite with moldova so countries around russia either obey moscow ~ ~ all the way ~ ~ 140 % or very bad things will happen,
