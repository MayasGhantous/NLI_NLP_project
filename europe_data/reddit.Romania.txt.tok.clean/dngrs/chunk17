  did a bit of digging and it seems it was on tv rossia 1 thats the main channel there i think, 
  supply me with alcohol and i will do it again :d, 
  well idk there 's some shady practice to pay as little tax as possible which already are low for big business, 
  especially because austrian firms have great business here, 
   so why should you have a right to vote ? 
  because the expat usually knows less about whats going on in the country so his vote matters even more than the locals ' to deceitful politicians, 
  it 's a sign that a bird shat on you, 
  does n't mean much at all and i expect that in the next years we will have lots of euroskepticism here if we get an orban of our own . 
  ie we have some big problems with energy price liberalising ( we 're doing it way too fast - it 's kinda punishing us for being rich in resources - and it will only get worse while wages are like 5 times lower than average ) , the obvious braindrain . 
  i do n't know if we actually profit from being in the eu but there 's no alternative so ... 
  it could be worse , i guess . 
  * looks at ukraine *, 
  stopped doing it a couple weeks ago because it 's too annoying to read all the shit that happens here http://imgur.com/uhhjtob, 
  http://www.forvo.com/word/republika_srpska/#bs it sounds like s\u00e2rbsca, 
  i 'd like that too !, 
  i do n't remember the last time we had a fight between politicians . 
  local news here says russian media is speaking about moldova allying with romania to attack transnistria do they really report that ? 
  is it mainstream media ? 
  yes `` i can not call it hungary , because we only arrived around 896 ad / the native dacians '' must be put on record, 
  it 's still playing with fire so at least politically we will ( already are ? ), 
  probably just stay out of it at least for a while, 
  i do n't think anybody knows about this issue and we do n't like ideas of separatism or even giving autonomy . 
  it wasnt as obvious as u think, 
  and the friends of putin, 
  http://imgur.com/njs4zsn but tbh who am i to xaxaxa, 
  it 's pompei in romanian, 
  you ruled . . china ? 
  [ some dacian statues pics ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vl48t ) more here http://statuidedaci.ro/en/italy/rome and [ here is dacian king decebal sculpted on a mountain ] ( http://www.destinationspoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/decebalus-statue.jpg ) most of the old ones are in italy i think . . dunno if we have any of that kind here notice the posture . 
  we were mainly agriculture focused ( most of us are still peasants ) and shephards today still have that look . 
  :d they lean on some kind of stick usually . . ca n't find a pic there is little we know from ancient times because the people here did n't register things so we rely mostly on what others wrote ( enemies , travelers ) . 
  we also do n't care about archaeology .

  lol, 
  thats from october last year it halfened now, 
  who ? 
  never heard of this, 
  damn you evil bozgor you jinxed it !, 
  [ i 'm waiting ... where is the shitstorm ? 
  the triannon treaty is taking place . 
  suddenly , the hungarian delegate interrupts the meeting and claims : - `` i 'd like to let you know , that on the day when we arrived to the carpathian basin , the romanians stole our horses that very night . '', 
  confused , the main negotiator asks : - `` would the hungarian speaker like his remarks to be recorded in the log ? '', 
  - `` no thank you . 
  it 's not neccessary '' . 
  minutes later , the hungarian speaks up again : - `` i 'd like to say , that on the day we arrived to the carpathian basin , the romanians stole our horses '' confused , the main negotiator asks : - `` would you like this to be recorded in the log ? '', 
  - `` no thank you . 
  it 's not important . '', 
  the hungarian speaks up one more time . 
  the romanian delegate , very angry , shouts : - `` you 're lying . 
  we were n't here back then . '', 
  the hungarian replies : - `` now make sure to put that on record . '', 
  ------------------- at the serbian border , the guard in the toll booth has had a good day , and says to a hungarian tourist : - `` i had a fantastic day . 
  i 'll let you take anything you want '' . 
  - `` really ? 
  i 'd like to take the border crossing sign , all the way to novi sad . '', 
  laci got romanian citizenship after that so , being a romanian now , tells arpad to fuck off . 
  it took me a while to figure it out :d, 
  war began between hungary and romania ... the hungarians had already invaded the north-east of romania . 
  the fight was heroic but none of the armies advanced , or gained field . 
  then a romanian general comes up with a plan ... whenever the romanians got close to the hungarian trenches every soldier yelled , '' hey , janos ! '' . 
  every hungarian would stand and proudly say , `` yes '' , so that the romanians could whack them this strategy lasted about three days , until the hungarians finally figured it out . 
  then a hungarian general tried to apply the same plan , yelling from the trenches ... `` hey ion '' , from the opposite trench , the romanian answers : `` ion 's not here at the moment , but who 's asking ? 
  is it you janos ? 
  at which point the hungarian general gets up on his feet and says `` yes '' ... 
  alcoholics and imperialists ie : who does russia neighbour with ? 
  whoever it wants, 
  a romanian , a gypsy and a hungarian were fishing on a lake . 
  at one moment their lines get tangled , and all three of them catch a golden fish which tell them that he will grant each one wish . 
  the hungarian says '' i want me and all my fellow hungarians to be wealthy and happy in hungary '' , the fish grants his wish and he disappears . 
  the gypsy asks the fish to give him and all his brethren a country of their of their own , wealth and happiness . 
  granted says the fish , and the gypsy vanishes . 
  the romanian , astonished , looks around then asks the fish , `` are the hungarians in hungary ? 
  '' , `` yes '' , `` all of them '' , `` yes '' , `` are all the gypsies in a country of their own ? 
  '' , `` yes '' , `` all of them ? 
  '' , `` sure '' , he stares at the fish and says ... `` i 'll have a pepsi light '', 
  as expected, 
  who votes on that ? 
  our government or our president ? 
  if it 's the government then i bet we will agree, 
   weak degenerate gay nazi too !, 
  this reminds me of fc steaua owner ( now in jail btw ) before big games he has a priest go in the stadium and bless kinda like this http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/2181/25668/12010280/47/2077905-mediafax-foto-foxfoto.jpg?width=990 more http://zoom.mediafax.ro/people/obiceiuri-religioase-12010280, 
  [ but the soviet union did n't end , tovarisch !, 
  http://imgur.com/korc3m8 http://ionut-puerava.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sfintire-4.jpg that guy is the patriarch, 
  we have buff bots too, 
   they asked which countries they like from the ones they had preselected, 
  well it 's difficult to check what people think about all the countries in the world so they picked some more relevant ones to us and a few random ( like japan ), 
  maybe for ** 8 ** bags of sunflower seeds ? 
  just 13 countries done, 
  we used to have lots of movies with this guy on tv, 
  and we all * love * drama, 
  iirc there was a thread like this somewhere in this sub, 
  you just werent picked for it the poll firm just picked those countries themselves and asked people what they think, 
  is that gipsy flair ? 
  yep by the time the core nato countries organise themselves us in the eastern front will be conquered, 
  you didnt check the links did you :d, 
  similar to other germanics it does n't mean much that you arent included in the poll, 
  results still look pretty believable, 
   german tribes used to inhabit parts of the country in the 6th-8th century goths conquered dacia somewhere around the 4th century, 
  60-70pc imo, 
  not sure why because i dont think we have many romanians there but here are some possible reasons : historical ties because belgium helped form the romanian state ( [ ie this which tagged us belgium of the orient ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1866_constitution_of_romania ) ) so it 's one of the first states we built relations with ( starting in 1838 ) eu capital there and we 're very proeu ( check eurobarometers ) . . our politicians still blame stuff on bruxelles though,
