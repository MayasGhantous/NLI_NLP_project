  anybody got a meme with orban and shit disturber caption ? 
  it 's safe, 
  first 4 lines of what i said apply to spain too i think the main minority there is romanian now . 
  lol, 
  anne is the last , not marie anne is of parma-bourbon, 
  1 . the score is actually pretty good for a country that is not ` western ' or moldova 2 . there are problems with the treatment of romanians/vlachs there - the biggest reason 3 . in general we dont like countries with strong ties to russia 4 . some historical reasons maybe ? 
  things were good since medieval hajduk times until ~ 20th century . 
  some errors on your part ( we have ours too like recognising croatia in '41 which i do n't think was our free choice really btw ) : in 1940 you recognised the soviet union right when it was claiming bessarabia , in that year you just made alliances with our enemies and we lost 1/3 of the country time in which there was some harassing from serbia  i recall one example being cited to back that claim was that romania refused the german ( ** and italian ** ) offer during the wwii to accept a part of vojvodina there we let the germans use our area to start the attack but yes we didnt accept taking southern banat ( apparently because antonescu did n't have support from romanians in that area for that ) and i think we negotiated with the germans for it to not be taken by magyars either . 
   they are only called gypsies in anglophone countries , it 's a pejorative derived from ` egyptians ' . 
  they thought they came from egypt and sticked with that, 
   romanian uses american film to high five a brit.that 's what hegemony looks like . 
  hard to wipe out the commie propaganda it will die out only along with the homo sovieticus, 
   is the oldest surviving document available in romanian that can be ** reliably dated ** it looks that way we dont care much about archaeology and things like that btw so who knows whats left undiscovered ... 
  um no http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_anne_of_romania you mean this btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_of_romania the mother in law of the balkans, 
  i did n't like what other gifs i had . 
  yep, 
  there are some reasons posted somewhere in this thread, 
   you got most of our gypsies i really doubt that . 
  i thought about that too but you still have those separatists . 
  moldova would maybe have to give up on transnistria . 
  gagauzia has special autonomy i think and that would encourage the szeklers to go for that which will not be seen well by the majority of voters so . . it 's not simple . 
  and popular support there is 50/50 . 
  here it 's high enough . 
  we wo n't federalise and we do n't like autonomous areas either . 
  dunno if politicians there would like to give up power without federalising . 
  btw they dont want to do that themselves . 
  i 'll answer tomorrow cause its almost 2 here, 
  k i give 7 bags of sunflower seeds deal ? 
  trivia : the first written document in romanian was sent to a german http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac%c8%99u%27s_letter, 
  its because we are both in the eu and russia is much stronger than hungary so less of a worry, 
  ** it does n't mean much if a country was n't picked . 
  for this poll they always use just ~ 20 countries . 
  ** i mean they pick 20 countries somewhat randomly ( most relevant ones + some randoms ) and ask people what they think about them, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_language http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/romanian.html http://www.omniglot.com/writing/romanian.htm, 
  is that some kind of threat ? 
  :d i suspect austria to have something ~ 60pc omv 's ties with gazprom do n't give good image i hear they are selling 25pc to them, 
  not with orban 's foreign policy, 
  he 's pretty popular too, 
  not sure but maybe these things matter 1 . german king and all ties that came with that ( until the 20s-30s there was huge progress made ) 2 . we love well organised people ( some kind of we like what we dont have ) 3 . german products give them good image, 
  we 'll have him then, 
  it would be interesting to see if it stays lost after the current one loses power, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/dictator_charlie2.jpg ), 
  he visits here often , says nice things and the media follows him . 
  i think the wild carpathia documentaries helped a lot . 
  i guess that 's a reason he 's like an ambassador  he is the most disliked royal of them all . 
  definitely not here, 
   please do not take this poll so reliable . 
  romanians in poland are considered as roma people . 
  it is a synonym what you said makes it reliable i knew about the gipsy association btw, 
  there 's hardly any from them :\\ there are other reasons they do n't even have to try, 
  i suspect that in this half of europe , it 's us and poland where you get highest rating , by far . 
  remove the visa trouble ( which no other eu countries has i think ) and you will be nr 1 in 2 years, 
  you want me to explain ? 
  my guess is it 's somewhere 50 % ish btw news last year reported about a poll in poland showing that we are unpopular there http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/stiri/sondaj++romanii++printre+cetatenii+cei+mai+detestati+de+polonezi http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/126111,poles-like-czechs-best who keeps downvoting here ? 
  or we know too well how some of the countries around us are and we have deep historical ties with most of those highly rated countries . 
   you hate the questions are about mostly positive/mostly negative feelings so you ca n't really tell . . anything over 50 % poz is just fine the only * baddies * are russia and hungary and the issues are * political *, 
  most of the blame being ours in case anyone is wondering , we spent 1.5 b euros for 50km of road http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-cancels-contract-with-bechtel nobody got in jail for that not yet anyway, 
  yeah for some reason chevron doesnt really = us ( maybe because it 's very . . 
  global ? ), 
  although ie we know what gazprom means, 
  you mean reunification ? 
  who will pay for that ? 
  and then are the problems with transnistria and even gagauzia, 
   the romanians i encountered did n't like americans just a minority i 'm sure the shield thing is fine ( we are ok with disturbing kremlin ) the diplomatic support in the case of the nearby conflict made up for the chevron or w/e stuff, 
  i think it ca n't get higher because of the visa issue . 
  it 's bottlenecked, 
   i disagree with you . 
  99.99 % of people do n't give a shit about that anymore , so that probably has no influence . 
  you just agreed there :d  actually it actually went up but by just 3-4 % compared to last october but still 40 % ish  basically , we were never friends with them . 
  again u agreed with me, 
  lots of romanians there they like to work there the relatives back home like the money they send there may be some historical tie too ( from back before communism ) idk oh ~ !, 
  and prince charles = =  big , big factor !, 
  the last ambassador was nice too ( got some tv time , learned romanian poetry . . people like that ), 
  http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2013/10/13/525adc04c7b855ff563290c9/627x0.jpg ( october ) u guys are even more popular lol looks like we dont care about politicians there even though all they say is reported by our media, 
  some reasons they took northern bucovina ( which i do n't think we care about btw ) current conflict does n't make it look nice even if we do n't like their aggressor i dont think we ever had good links with them ( ties with russia do n't make it look good ) -- main thing  i actually expected us to take that spot . 
  i think i 've seen that with arabs . 
  no clue ... you 're just not visible here i guess all there is in the media about bulgaria is that we compete with it at being the worst in europe or something like that so it 's not hate , it 's just that rich countries with lots of expats from here get higher rating . 
  we 're probably seen the same there too . 
  [ press article ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/sondaj-inscop-germania-ja-rusia-niet-rezultatele-descifrate-specialisti-1_53d7d9730d133766a8d83271/index.html ) [ poll firm article ] ( http://www.inscop.ro/iulie-2014-simpatie-tari/ ) both in romanian so use google translate or search later for foreign links nu \u015ftiu means i dunno and you can figure out the rest easily [ this is from last october ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2013/10/13/525adc04c7b855ff563290c9/627x0.jpg ) i 'm surprised to see the uk is still very popular . 
  hmm looks like france went up too which is also a bit weird . 
  ( i guess the gipsy problems there made us sympathise with them or something / / oh we liked the last ambassador ), 
  how could you forget about that ? 
  it 's reacting more and more childish :d, 
  could but wont its too late especially if the current power does well in the next elections this autumn screwing their economy that much would just make the commies lose more votes, 
  no , it is bestest !, 
  * russia 's nightmare maybe, 
  * googles pics * looks like a vampire the corpse is undead and i can confirm i know my vampires, 
  u are wrong http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption, 
  or is his son ( justice party chairman ), 
  everybody hates bob . 
  dark beer or red wine, 
  i tried to find some disease related news about the kid and found nothing . 
  well muresan is what , 2.31 ? 
  i 'm sure this kid will eventually grow by 5 cm more . 
  news this month : he is now 2.26 m, 
  you are now banned from / r/italy, 
  i do n't like it . 
   they could , but the public is already having their doubts . 
  time for a distraction ? 
   but now that 's very difficult .
