  it 's officially romanian language there again http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-romanian-official-language/25191455.html, 
  it 's very complicated, 
  the first names to come to mind are schroder , orban and berlusconi, 
  maybe the other bans were temporary so they keep reapplying them, 
  sanctions will be stronger but nothing really great . 
  the main countries with influence on this do n't and still wo n't want to put their relations with russia in danger so i 'm skeptical . 
  so does she want to give the terrorists time to try to cover this up or something ? 
  again . . ? 
  didnt they ban it all already ? 
  1 romanian ( double nationality with german ) student here, 
   evil ukrainian nazi jews u forgot homogay, 
  now look at who the friends of / r/europe 's favorite character , putin , are . 
  english equivalent : birds of a feather flock together en.wikiquote.org/wiki/romanian_proverbs, 
  russia might argue that kiev lost all control in a very dangerous region and thus they need to ( openly ) intervene . 
  maybe this was some kind of false flag . 
   this is going to be a fucking nightmare for putin and russia . 
  not really . 
  the west will make loud noise about this and that will be pretty much all it will do so no worries for putin . 
  they dropped off a lorry,

  np just pick for urself from the lists there, 
  our laws are bad too ie for bruxelles elections you need 100 000 signatures funny thing : a party ( noua republica i think ) had ~ 10000 votes in that last election while our law requires ur party to show 25k signatures ( from 18 counties and minimum 700 each which must be confirmed in the year before any election / they collect ur signature + most of ur id data like name , address , that special number , etc ) so not even the ones who signed did n't all vote for that party lol ( obviously signatures are n't gathered fairly ) this is one of the reasons why we do n't have eurosceptic parties . 
  so mp ? 
  http://www.romanian-explorer.com/en-index.html http://romaniatourism.com/, 
  just swim across the danube :d, 
  im not doing it anymore its not healthy to keep up with our news, 
  it wont recognise fascist homogay states ' borders, 
  are they geting desperate ? 
  fox news is quality press compared to rt imo, 
  so we 're by far the most francophile in the eastern half, 
  common eu foreign policy is so very far away, 
  albania ? 
  as expected, 
  our media loves to follow what the dailyfail writes about us, 
  it depends are you a fascist european homogay ? 
   they 've also managed to export most of their social problems i have the feeling that not most of them left and the few that did are enough to make it look that way . 
  i thought we import ~ 2/3s of our food, 
  it 's more suited here / r/geopolitics, 
  the streets are empty they are too sad, 
  good downvotes from the westerners than didnt have their countries fucked up by communism, 
  but its totally ok on everybody else, 
  i mean what ice-free ( warm water ) ports does china have ? 
  what other ports like that does china have ? 
  lenin tried to give siberia back ? 
  it 's been this way for as long as i can remember . 
  the government just wants to avoid parliament even though it has a lot of support . 
  the reason is ` because it can ' . 
  he is saying everybody is hypocritical so that makes it ok, 
  i dont think ive ever posted anything about the soldiers there, 
  you missed all the news about soldiers geting killed there then or when they sent messages during holidays or w/e, 
  ofc there are http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/a-inceput-retragerea-trupelor-romanesti-din-afganistan--341084 we are in nato you know we will be out of there soon though, 
  hypocritical,

  sorry i meant i already got just those, 
  yeah but its not easy to focus on that, 
  it 's a bit too many some links from bbc and reuters seem enough for now , 
  is there a good list of feeds ? 
  any other nice feeds ? 
  some other link said 6, 
  looks like it 's almost all foreign owned mainly by germans , french and belgians . 
  some people dont like it because it was done on xmas day some think it was done because the new power ( mostly 2nd echelon commies ) feared something he could say or do, 
  there are problems with anthrax infested beef in hungary . 
  did russia banned meat from orban 's too ? 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/04/us-hungary-anthrax-iduskbn0f90j920140704 dont say hungary doesnt export to them because we dont either and they still banned meat from us ( it still matters ), 
   people make change and we just do n't have the right people , yet . 
  yeah things might be better after the homo sovieticus dies out, 
  one reason is moldova still depends a lot on russian energy so they dont want to upset them that much, 
   nevertheless , unwillingness to spend political capital in pursuit of settlement does not mean willingness to accept secession . 
  even less does it suggest a willingness to accept annexation by russia . 
  in this sense , it is no different than russia with respect to chechnya , georgia with respect to abkhazia and south ossetia , and azerbaijan with respect to nagorno-karabakh . 
  objectively , each of these countries would be politically , economically , and militarily better off allowing the separatists to go their own way , but subjectively the electorate in each country considers such a move almost unthinkable , and no government could survive if it proposed it . 
  there 's an article where it writes that if moldova improves it 's economy and kiev stays prowest then russia will lose power ( in time ) in transnistria . 
  maybe that 's what the government is hoping for ? 
   chi\u015fin\u0103u 's best hope for eventually reaching a settlement with transnistria would be for eu integration to raise the standard of living in moldova proper , while a pro-european government in kyiv makes russia 's presence in the pmr increasingly untenable . 
  this outcome became considerably more likely after moldova and ukraine , along with georgia , signed so-called association agreements and deep and comprehensive free-trade agreement ( aa/dcfta ) with the european union on june 27 . 
   moscow no doubt assumes , in my view correctly , that moldova 's integration into the eu will be increasingly difficult to derail over time . 
  it must also assume that its position in transnistria will become more costly and precarious if ukraine also integrates successfully into the west . 
  the obvious problem for moscow is that goods , officials , soldiers , and military equipment passing from russia to transnistria ( and/or back ) have to transit ukraine or romania . 
  permission from both countries to do so is likely to become increasingly difficult , particularly for military assets . 
  maybe it 's important for voters ? 
  i 'd imagine that if the government gives up on it , the commies would criticise more and get a lot of support . 
  maybe it 's afraid it will lose gagauzia next then . 
  i 'd suspect there are limits ( that 's why you have some kind of council to supervise this , there 's no such thing as absolute free speech ) that have been broken . 
  we have some problems too with a particular media group .
