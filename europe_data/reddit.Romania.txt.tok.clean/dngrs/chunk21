  i 'm sure there 's a big difference between the average station 's bias and the prorussian ones ' .

  transports ministry has the railroads one ( cfr , lokomotiv ), 
  a lot depends on the november elections the commies must not win ( ~ 25 % in polls i think ) here 's a long and good article on it http://eurasiangeopolitics.com/2014/07/03/transnistria-a-bridge-too-far-for-the-kremlin/, 
   the `` scandinavica currency collection operation '' was initiated `` with the aim of receiving foreign currency through over-billing the payments made in the contract between ice tehnoforestexport with ikea of sweden very shady people worked in ices ( exterior commerce enterprises ) 2 of them are being investigated by prosecutors in various cases ( one is the richest man in the country , ioan niculae , and the other a millionaire media mogul and politician , dan voiculescu ) it 's thought that these guys started their early businesses with money stolen from those companies  most of the money held in those communist coffers was never accounted for , but many prominent figures from the securitate rose to dominate romania 's business environment , the military , the police and areas of public policy in the subsequent democracy . 
  yep . 
  romanian capitalism . 
  btw the money the richest romanians ( with few exceptions like tiriac ) made and keep making is ~ 80 % from controversial state contracts ( there was news about this a few weeks ago and you can find the link posted by me in one of the weekly threads from the last couple of months )  ikea 's deals with tehnoforestexport make no mention of third parties or payments to ice dunarea , speaking only vaguely of `` spare parts '' and `` service activity '' . 
  all big companies that made exports ( we were a big exporter ) worked through ice dunarea ( which belonged to the securitate )  curiously , although verbally condemned by politicians , no laws were passed to hold the securitate to account . 
  no lustration either,

  it 's a mistake to focus so much just on putin because another one like him can take his place .

  thanks, 
  can u put it on pastebin ? 
  i doubt the russian government would do that kind of stuff in serbia . 
  1:21 are those fries ? 
   it was supported by various pro-russian activists . 
  why ? 
  i think we have something similar going on here . 
  assange !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paparuda btw i dont think this ritual is still practiced, 
  another effect right after and during the ` prayer ' is that your eyes feel heavy and you feel sleepy . 
   the evil eye is n't really evil here btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evil_eye#mexico, 
  we have that evil eye thing too and i think it 's real i remember i got headaches ( always kinda mild ) when i used to go to the countryside and visit some old people and later i found out that it 's because some old woman 's look ( the evil eye is n't really evil here btw ) and some women have some effective prayer ( some kind of whispering and the forehead is massaged a bit ) for it . 
  after my mom does it , my headache goes away in a minute or so but you have to move a bit away from where your standing during prayer or w/e it is . 
  for some reason not all women can use it well . 
   in greece , the evil eye is cast away through the process of xematiasma ( \u03be\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 ) , whereby the `` healer '' silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex , usually a grandparent . 
  yep , my grandma 's is much better than my mom 's . 
   there is another form of the `` test '' where the `` healer '' sets on fire using as a matchstick a clove . 
  which is then thrown in water . 
  if the clove `` explodes '' upon touching water the evil eye was cast . 
  if it burns out silently it was n't . 
  i remember some old relative for prayer used an empty cup ( or maybe it had a bit of water in it ) and a burning matchstick in it . 
  i do n't think she used it for anything and it did n't help my headache . 
   according to custom , if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye , both victim and `` healer '' then start yawning profusely i confirm, 
  first to come to mind is the calusari dance which has prechristian roots www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/34eur_uk.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c4%83lu%c8%99ari there are videos on youtube it 's some kind of shamanic healing/blessing w/e dance, 
  there 's a very long way left to go,
