  he uses him . 
  partly to fish for useful reactions . 
  russia just canceled a plane trip from chisinau to moscow this morning . 
  oh and the agreements have been signed . 
  ria novosti state propaganda said that what the 3 countries are doing is `` voluntary acceptance of slavery '' this is the article it also says russia should intervene to protect those that do n't want to become slaves https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fria.ru%2fanalytics%2f20140626%2f1013709358.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url, 
  you need to have been studying here for 6 + months or have residence and you can ask to take the exam in english language this is just what i could find googling besides that i do n't think there are problems, 
  and basescu can translate into fartson, 
  fingers crossed, 
  yeah lets just keep him president for life, 
  his son in law is investigated in another case too btw, 
  republics are damn old too, 
  so russia supports selfdetermination ( ie crimea ) but not in it 's own country . 
  totally surprising, 
   he would have zero chances without media support yeah most of it is really biased he 'd still have some media support though and i do think he can make it to the 2nd round because he 's strong in polls and there 's little time left until the elections so he ca n't lose much, 
   said he will recognise kosovo as soon as he becomes president ( which is against the will of the majority of romanians ) . 
  is there even a poll on this ? 
  udmr will have it 's own candidate and in 2nd round i have the feeling they will support the ` right wing ' candidate there 's a chance they will even leave the government, 
   because i have n't seen any manifesto as if it would actually mean anything he ca n't be worse than iliescu or basescu so . . that 's a very good thing, 
  it 's not clear yet if he will be pnl 's or pnl+pdl 's candidate  do you think romania is ready to have a minority president ? 
  :d are we xenophobic or something ? 
  germany is idealised btw, 
   bulgarian, 
  candidates : albania , iceland , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and turkey http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union, 
   i do n't think another post-communist leader in the eastern bloc was ever heard saying such obviously incriminating statements . 
  reminds me of this current pm ponta a few years ago ( after the 2009 presidentials , he was party spokeperson or something ) said , after he was asked about elections being fixed , that pdl 's ` system of fraud and theft worked better ' ( his party psd lost ), 
   russia 's president has asked parliament to revoke the right of military intervention in ukraine , where rebels have been fighting government troops . 
  he could just ask again later for that right to be given back, 
  v3 then, 
  maybe it 's part of their russification, 
  lol, 
   neighbors are still ~ ~ much richer ~ ~ less poorer, 
  and ours is ~ 30 %, 
   yatsenyuk he is of partly romanian ancestry , with one of his grandparents being a citizen of greater romania from the region around chernivtsi poroshenko lived a while in bender and i guess he picked it up there, 
  yeah  but as an outsider moldova it is a beautiful , interesting place ** to visit **, 
  i guess those are wines originally made for the russian market, 
   but if they really were pro-romanian , they would 've unified long ago , like germany . 
  and who was going to pay for that to happen ? 
  hmm ? 
  the current president is very pro-ro too trivia !, 
  the pm and president of ukraine both speak romanian, 
   most moldovans are ant\u0456-roman\u0456an i doubt it, 
  yeah it should be a rich only club / s, 
  yeah it 's just aa and dcfta so far, 
  in the romanian folk poem miorita , a shepherd boy is warned by his beloved ewe , miorita , that his fellow shepherds plan to murder him and take his flock . 
  instead of resisting , he accepts his fate , asking only that miorita go in search of his mother and tell her the story not of how he was betrayed , but of how he was married to the daughter of a powerful king . 
  thereafter , wherever the ewe wanders , she tells the story -- not the true , unadorned facts of death and betrayal , but a beautiful fiction of a transcendent wedding . 
  this simple story , told and retold in countless versions , is romania 's most enduring cultural text . 
  ( 1 ) the popularity of the miorita can be attributed to the power and simplicity of its poetry , but even more to its mythic structure . 
  the myth has been used to define the romanian character by several authors , including mircea eliade , who has called the `` cosmic marriage '' of the miorita an example of `` cosmic christianity '' -- part pagan , part christian , but in any case wholly romanian -- `` dominated by a nostalgia for nature sanctified by the presence of jesus . 
  '' ( 2 ) but the most controversial concept of romanian identity to be derived from the poem is the concept of `` mioritic space '' defined by the transylvanian poet and philosopher lucian blaga . 
  for blaga , the path of miorita 's wandering delineates what he calls `` mioritic space , '' a geography of the romanian poetic imagination , or , as one recent historian of the romanians describes it , `` a philosophical attempt to explain the romanian spirit through the romanian landscape , which [ blaga ] saw as the stylistic matrix of romanian culture '' ( georgescu 205 ) . 
  blaga 's critics have charged that this concept has become a liability , nationalistic , escapist and fatalistic . 
  for political analysts , blaga has been criticized as a romantic aesthete , self-absorbed and disengaged from political realities , while pursuing a mystical communion with nature . 
  ( 3 ) in this view , mioritic space is an escapist dream of a romantic nationalist that encourages political apathy . 
  for ethnographers , it is a romantic distortion of the romanian peasantry 's connection to the land that ignores political and historical reality . 
  these critics suggest that it may even account for the tendency of the romanian people to suffer oppression passively : `` one 'cause ' of the seeming passivity of the romanian population may be the fatalistic weltanschaaung implicit in the miorita '' ( kligman 356 ) . 
  but to blaga , mioritic space was simply a way of locating the romanian poetic spirit . 
  all these theories and criticisms may seem like much ado about a boy and his sheep , but the story has great resonance to a country long troubled by internal conflicts and external conquerors . 
  it has often been noted that romania is , geographically , `` inside-out , '' its mountains in the interior , its plains on the borders , leaving it vulnerable to invasion . 
  more than once has the romanian spirit had to take refuge from the threats presented to its exposed borders by escaping to the mountains and forests of its interior . 
  when the threat was institutionalized within its own borders during the turkish and communist regimes , the romanian spirit could survive only by going into physical ( usually political ) or metaphysical exile . 
  i dont think so, 
  the fatalist mentality it 's so deeply ingrained that there 's even national literature that shows this, 
  well people have themselves to blame first but besides that , one cause of their problems is russia 's imperialism . 
  it still has a centuries old fetish for fucking up other countries . 
  check out the history of the last 3 or 4 centuries of this region . 
   russia 's favorite method to troll the country is to ban wine imports . 
  they did it a couple of times still doing it and not only for wine  in school they learn romanian literature and romanian history , but the media and some politicians keep saying they are different from romanians . 
  and most of those are probably prorussians ( communist party ) . 
  btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification#bessarabia.2fmoldova part of the russian divide and conquer game  first is the problem of transnistria again russia  how is it possible for a democratic country more like semidemocratic though . 
  i do n't think it ever was actually democratic , not by westerners ' standards anyway . 
  same with ours . 
  / /  a possible solution . 
  maybe there should first be a solution for russia lol . 
  geting moldova closer to the eu is definitely a step in the right direction . 
  then a foreign threat is needed russia is a suitable candidate but only easterners are worried the thing is cutting is n't a problem because there 's a lot of money already . 
  we need more common policies . 
  fresh news : prosecutors are accusing his son-in-law of fraud and forgery in a case about retrocession of some land, 
   in fact they might be even against it because it rocks the status quo it would be incentive for all the other separatist groups, 
  i do n't see much difference i mean day to day it 's the same . 
  for example there was a poll a few months ago showing that 2/3s of romanians give bribes to doctors so ... a few big names sent to prison and that 's it really . 
   but the only police we spoke to were fine and welcoming imo authorities are more careful when dealing with foreigners, 
  so have there been assassination attempts ? 
  i 'm talking about those antiseparatist billionaires, 
  this reminds me of  `` there is no such thing as a former kgb man '' putin, 
  i 'm not sure how effective it is though but maybe it 's too early to tell .
