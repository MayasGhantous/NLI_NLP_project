  meanwhile our expm nastase , currently in jail the 2nd time , might get ` extra ' prison time he 's doing his 4 year sentence but prosecutors want 1 more added, 
  so this would be done to please the eu or what ? 
  like albania 's doing with those weed growers ? 
   do you think uruguay will be an easy matchup ? 
  je m ` attends \u00e0 un score serr\u00e9, 
  from the atlantic to vladivostok, 
   and is far from american 's trigger-happy and plain dumb `` who will we attack this year ? '', 
  attitude . 
  only because he does n't have the us 's power i 'm sure he 'd do a lot of damage if he could, 
  it 's actually germany but they only played once so far, 
  imagine argentina not making it either lol, 
  why are you sure ? 
  group stage btw no wins for either of them, 
  shows how effective russiatoday is i suspect many of these read that, 
  or he could go with antonia, 
  really ?

  yeah they do n't know much of what 's going on back home so it 's easier for erdogan to get votes right ? 
   they have next to no idea what is going on here you just answered yourself, 
   they also suggested president basescu had knowledge of his brother 's dealings . 
  our intelligence service sri is monitoring clans like bercea 's and it 's possible that they informed the president about his brother ( i 'm sure he knew already anyway )  the leftist government of prime minister victor ponta lol leftist :d and what the president said is total bullshit [ here 's a pic of him with bercea during a campaign ] ( http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/4141/1255040199160101639160b.jpg ) ( i guess he needed bercea to gather gipsy votes and/or for something really crooked , who knows ), 
   the secret service i wonder if in the future you will have secret agents acting like journalists working for that weekly . 
  a few years ago here some agents were caught working for jurnalul national . 
  one of them was even a chief editor . 
  afaik nothing happened to those agents and i guess our special services are untouchable . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_intelligence_service#relationship_with_the_press read it  the jurnalul na\u021bional newspaper fired its editor-in-chief , valentin zaschievici , in august 2012 , accusing him of being an infiltrated sri agent , following the leak of some sri documents by cotidianul . 
  [ 20 ] the romanian intelligence service admitted that the documents were indeed genuine , but it claimed that their agent was only monitoring the leaking of secret documents to the press . 
  [ 20 ] or maybe you already have but they were n't caught, 
   the renegotiations would be for everyone . 
  i didnt know . 
  details , link ? 
   i 'm afraid he will not even make it look like we are getting renegotiations to help us to stay in europe why should the uk be so special ? 
  some more details  he got 7 and a half years for attempted murder / / or 9 i 'm not sure it was for stabbing his own nephew mircea gave some of the money back ( a few hundred k ) and it was in dollars lol, 
  this world cup is really exciting, 
  where did franco get it from ? 
   appears to admit receiving money from a member of an convicted underworld boss 's family in order to intervene at judiciary level for a milder sentence of the latter he got 7 and a half years for attempted murder / / or 9 i 'm not sure the guy [ , some kind of gipsy mobster , ] ( http://media.realitatea.ro/multimedia/image/201102/full/bercea_mondialu_56626200.jpg ) wanted basescu ( we do have lots of crooked judges ) to influence the high court judges ( btw this week an investigation started for 2 and 2 ex ones but in a different case that does n't have to do with this ) and gave him a few hundreds of thousands of euros ( through a middle man obviously ) but it did n't work and then he arranged a blackmail to get his money back in the video , the president 's brother ( a controversial weapon seller / there was another scandal in 2009 ) says he only got 250k euros ( bercea gave 600 ) they also talk about the sentence saying that he should have got 1 year transcript and video here in romanian http://www.antena3.ro/romania/discutia-bercea-mondial-mircea-basescu-fratele-presedintelui-la-mine-au-ajuns-250-000-atunci-cand-257646.html the president will make his first comments ( this scandal is a week old i think and it 's very rare for him to shut up ) in an hour hmm bercea says he actually gave 2 million euros and some of the money went to the heads of the anticorruption agency , high court and the demlib party  antena 3 has been attacking the president for many years and is now seen as close to the governing social democrats . 
  hotnews has it 's bias too btw i wonder if there will be a third impeachment attempt [ here 's a pic of the president with bercea ] ( http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/4141/1255040199160101639160b.jpg )  the links between mircea basescu and sandu anghel , also known as `` bercea mondial '' , are long lasting : in 2010 , the president 's brother baptized a member of bercea mondial 's family . 
  bercea mondial is also reputed to have similar relations with other top politicians and judges . 
  other godfathers : expm ( and currently mep i think ) theodor stolojan , an ex bucharest tribunal judge ( named one of the kids ` judge ' / some gypsies have weird names ) , an expresident of the supreme court and some other prosecutors/judges/prefects [ * ro link ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-17509954-cine-este-bercea-mondial-cum-ajuns-anturajul-familiei-basescu-inghesuit-politicieni-judecatori-boteze-copii.htm ) this bercea has been investigated in over 100 cases and he 's been great at dodging prison .

  is it common for children of immigrants to not learn the native languages of their parents ? 
  all our parties just love the church btw just a few days ago a mp said there 's too much money given to the church and he got boo 'd by the other mps in parliament the orthodox church is very well supported and it 's important during elections ( and maybe some shadier things ) so it 's indispensable for almost all our politicians the good news is that trust in the church is steadily declining, 
  nah not yet anyway, 
  these laureats are russophobic fascists they are also gay !, 
  u are overreacting, 
  they want to build nuclear plants there too ?

  do u mean he wont win ? 
  i did n't expect greece and turkey to be so green . 
  i thought churches there have a lot of power . 
  i wonder how much of it gets sent right back away because so many products here are foreign made . 
  so . . how is this ihsanoglu ? 
  compared to erdogan, 
   voiculescu is convicted , he 'll go to prison his case will be closed this year if he does n't get a final sentence and he is magnificent at dodging this so far  he did n't spend my tax money go check the case he 's investigated in such naivety, 
  i like the idea of this article but it 's badly made, 
  less bad than the other 2, 
  i do n't understand how you 're so oblivious of this . 
  they have a heavy bias towards pc and whoever they are allied with . 
  notice how much they criticise the opposition and support the government because pc is in it . 
   without much consideration to the political colour . 
  not true at all, 
  maybe they 're the exception :d ? 
  and maybe they 're not that attractive strategically to make it worth it . . compared to us anyway, 
   but you have to try and possess certain qualities . 
  which we do not have because there 's too much backstabbing in our politics, 
   three powers menaced our existance and ( at least ) one of them is rearing it 's ugly head again, 
  the problem is whats gon na happen when they stop sending money the ones that left the country and settled there will probably remain there ( some might come back to retire here ) while their relatives get money sent from them but there 's a problem their kids from back home are likely to leave following their parents and the expats ' parents will die in a couple of decades meaning there wo n't be much reason for sending any money anymore we do n't look prepared for that and there is no interest from our government to bring immigrants, 
  well we have some problems with statistics institute and censuses meaning they are a bit controversial we do n't really know how many of us there are, 
  a couple of decades just to see some change is not that optimistic, 
  but jihad, 
  think of the austrohungarian empire and search for hungary, 
  lol, 
  lithuania / latvia  slovakia / slovenia think of czechoslovakia and look for where the czech are  bulgaria / romania we 're right north of the danube and one can check for the carpathians  paraguay / uruguay paraguay is landlocked this is obviously advice for when you 're looking on a map,

  yeah just between 2010 and 2013 we 've had 8 mps and ministers sentenced for corruption alone ( some were ex-members ), 
   june 1990 there were a few more jan 1990 , feb 1990 , sept 1991 and another in 1999 one of the main guys responsible for this , expresident iliescu , is doing very well today and many people still like him ( so he is still involved in politics )  he , along with other figures in the leading fsn , was allegedly responsible for calling the jiu valley miners to bucharest on 28 january and 14june 1990 to end the protests of the citizens gathered in university square , bucharest , protests aimed against the ex-communist leaders of romania ( like himself ) . 
  the pejorative term for this demonstration was the golaniad ( from the romanian golan , rascal ) . 
  on 13 june , an attempt of the authorities to remove from the square around 100 protesters , which had remained in the street even after the may elections had confirmed iliescu and the fsn , resulted in attacks against several state institutions , such as the ministry of interior , the bucharest police headquarters and the national television . 
  iliescu issued a call to the romanian people to come and defend the government , prompting several group of miners to descend on the capital , armed with wooden clubs and bats . 
  they trashed the university of bucharest , some newspaper offices and the headquarters of opposition parties , claiming that they were havens of decadence and immorality - drugs , firearms and munitions , `` an automatic typewriter '' , and fake currency . 
  the june 1990 mineriad in particular was widely criticized both at home and internationally , with one historian ( andrei pippidi ) comparing the events to nazi germany 's kristallnacht . 
  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] government inquiries later established that the miners were infiltrated and instigated by former securitate operatives,
