  selling germans ( ~ 200k ) just a few decades ago btw there was a poll a month or so ago and 80 + % said it was a bad idea 40000 are left so ~ 83 % of the local german minority back then is gone,

  afaik monarchy support is increasing year by year but in very small increments and it 's ~ 1/3 in polls http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/sondaj-inscop-41-dintre-romani-ar-vota-pentru-mentinerea-republicii-27-2-ar-alege-monarhia-648817.html there would need to be a referendum but there is a problem with our constitution . 
  it does n't allow anything else besides republic so we 'd need a completely new one which would be very difficult to do and maybe unconstitutional or something . 
  ( 1 ) the provisions of this constitution with regard to the national , independent , unitary and indivisible character of the romanian state , the republican form of government , territorial integrity , independence of justice , political pluralism and official language shall not be subject to revision . 
  among politicians , only a handful of liberals ( like a couple of expms ) support or at least sympathise with the idea of monarchy and besides them they are all `` republican '' afaik the liberals officially want a switch to parliamentary republic which imo would be a step closer to constitutional monarchy and there have been attempts to modify the constitution ( to lower the power of the president ) in the last years but there was failure ( not enough people came to vote though it was planned the same day with local elections ) we have this house btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_royal_family, 
  yeah when i edit i break some links by mistake,

   it really brings to light how devastating soviet policies were . 
  settling russians everywhere , forcibly resettling non-russians elsewhere . 
  maybe it means small party, 
  maybe a bit of all those and there 's pressure from bruxelles and washington too . 
  it will be very interesting to see if anything changes in the next years . 
  you know whats interesting us representatives like biden and the ambassadors love to talk about anticorruption here, 
   i think russia would jump at the opportunity to drop this situation yep russia already won so they can back down and i guess they want to look as if they are n't doing this forced . 
  putin got crimea and managed to fuck up ukraine enough to make it likely they wo n't get eu/nato membership . 
  another goal that might be achieved is federalising ukraine which makes it easier for his divide n conquer game,
