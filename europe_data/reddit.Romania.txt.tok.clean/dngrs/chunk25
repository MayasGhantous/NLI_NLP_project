  a vp and exminister , radu stroe , got kicked out of the party . 
  he 's been siding with the ruling group for some time already . 
  some purging going on .

  it might make it easier for an opposition alliance to be formed because the rest of the parties are epp . 
  there are negotiations for a merger , probably after the presidential elections in november , between pnl and pdl and maybe fc or pmp might be absorbed later . 
  some liberals said that alde has too many leftleaning parties . 
  the new pnl-pdl party will be wear pnl 's name , logo , everything .

  nope, 
  well yeah that too, 
  no . . that one is tiberiu nitu kovesi is head of dna ( anticorruption agency ), 
  and draghici is likely to actually try to do something for gypsies it could have been just another party dumbass going to the ep mainly for the benefits it gives like i suspect is the case for many of our meps,

  yes but draghici is a ** romanian ** gipsy, 
  trivia : expm nastase , who got sentences 2 times and is currently in prison again , built the anticorruption agency . 
  the main reason imo is that there is much pressure from bruxelles ( mainly because of mcv ) and washinton . 
  the socialdems and their friends and very upset by this anticorruption push . 
   romanian initiative lol :d, 
   the justice system is finally starting to be independent and fair , however , the problem is that the quality of politicians is not improving . 
  thats because there 's a lot of inertia and this anticorruption wave is still new we might see change * if * this trend continues for many years, 
  tbf for a long time they had little reason to be careful, 
  gr vs pt - no cr7 , right ? 
  ir-it very big fitness test for g. rossi trivia : cristian manea is the youngest ever debutant for us and our coach has a sentence for aiding and abetting which is not a problem for our football `` elite '', 
  oh yes please, 
   eleven mayors sentenced what kind of mayors ? 
  village ones ? 
  and ~ 1/4 ( 10 or so ) of our county council presidents are being investigated . 
   in the 20th century russia and china learned what tyranny is , * and they have rejected it . 
  * i dont think so, 
  anybody knows how relations are between erdogan and putin or nazarbaev ? 
  i suspect they get along very well . 
  yes , please . 
  can we join ? 
  could many of them betray their party though ? 
  keep the money but they will have to quit politics because nobody else would accept them ? 
  so these guys wont form an ep group ? 
  would the money they 'd get as meps matter much to them in future elections ? 
  could the fn grow stronger in local elections ? 
  where are the older weekly thread posted ? 
  i cant find them . 
  is there an index ? 
  most of them are biased , at least 2 are a lot like foxnews ( antena3 and the rest that are owned by intact and politician and hopefully soon2be convict [ voiculescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_voiculescu ) . 
  the 2nd one is rtv owned by another very crooked politician ghita ) . 
  the one that really seems decent is digi24 which is noncommercial ( ? ), 
  but privately owned . 
  and i 'd be surprised if there is n't work regarding preparing a new putin or w/e they plan, 
   when putin is gone lol there 's a whole system behind putin that will not change after just putin dies . 
  still bribes, 
  oh yeah its very common for our parties here iirc some of their members even admitted to this kind of stuff ( hrebenciuc from psd ) and 2 years ago a news website ( gandul ) searched to see where the comments posters were from and they found out they were from the headquarters of pdl youth team in constanta ( and they had internet set up by a special service ) it 's a real phenomenon and i think they have their texts prewritten by someone and they just spam it everywhere, 
  honestly it 's unclear what they will benefit from this maybe it makes it easier to side with the other opposition parties but i dont think its necesary to go epp maybe it has more to do with foreign issues than domestic reasons :\\ they didnt complain about alde though afaik, 
   philosophies of governance did n't seem to play in to how my friends and colleagues voted . 
  it 's usually the lesser evil and campaign rhetoric is always `` look how bad the other candidates are ''  our mayor switched from psd to pdl , and in so doing a lot of money suddenly appeared yep bribes :d after 2012 's elections i think we had a record number of these `` traseisti '', 
  i guess 4 . is why 2 . is happening, 
  i wonder what ukip and the rest would say if we sent extremists too . 
  would farage call us fascists or something ? 
  25 with the 6 from our pnl ? 
  idk doubt it, 
  they 've had affiliation with alde for over 2 decades afaik, 
  are they euroskeptic ? 
  who they gon na join ? 
  they 've been in alde for ~ 2 decades btw . 
  this is a lot like all our local elections when many mps after geting elected change party . 
  edit again something like this happened before . 
  the democratic party was since the 90s until 2005 part of the socialist international and in 2005 it switched to epp . 
  in 2008 it became pdl after merging with a splinter group of pnl . 
  antonescu wont run again so far it 's johannis and orban, 
  relations between the president and pdl have been weaker for some time already and that 's one of the reasons why many left from pdl to pmp which is the president 's new favorite toy i think they will absorb pdl like they did with other groups already iirc, 
  they were the only ones from alde here btw 6 meps, 
  they were supposed to keep affiliation with alde, 
  he is interim leader until next party congress, 
  a few minutes ago they voted to join epp there were rumours since february or so about them joining epp but pnl denied it, 
  dunno if he was a candidate but he is not an mep now list at the bottom of the article http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/rezultate-partiale-alegeri-europarlamentare-psd-unpr-pc-37-25-pnl-14-86-pdl-12-26-live-text-12649917, 
  centrified, 
  same here but i still would n't have voted for sd i really like guy, 
  the `` left '' also won the partial mp elections turnout 32.24 % compared to 27 last time ruling alliance supports pes in ep , pnl - alde and most of the rest or all of them support epp we have presidential elections in november and there 's a big chance the left will get everything which is very bad that actor had a lot of media support from the same company that supports the ruling party and it 's owned by voiculescu who controls pc populist ppdd went from 14pc in 2012 's elections to 3pc ( no mep ) because their tv station was banned which really openly supported ppdd so you can see what a huge influence tv has in our elections there were some problems with bribery ( slippers , money , food vouchers , beer , ice cream ) and a phenomenon we call electoral tourism ( people get in a bus and they drive from voting base to voting base and vote for w/e paid them . . mostly ruling alliance this time ) votes cancelled 5.79 compared to 3.86 last time no extremists from us deputy president klaus johannis and president crin antonescu of pnl will quit ( so far it seems like they will be simple members ) antonescu said he will propose that pnl ( 6 meps ) joins epp and he does this because the left must not win ec presidency . 
  there were rumours that they will join epp and they were denied . 
  16 meps from the ruling group ( usd ) , 4 pdl , 3 udmr , 2 pmp ( the one the president very actively supported ) + diaconu means we send 32, 
  do you get fines in greece and cyprus for not voting ? 
  what happens ? 
  * seems to be, 
  ok makes sense now i guess :d, 
   conservative liberal ? 
  yes he is, 
  it is new,
