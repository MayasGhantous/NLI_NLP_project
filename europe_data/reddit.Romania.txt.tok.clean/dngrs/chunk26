  you 'll probably know after the elections results come . 
   what gives ? 
  people are very disappointed by mainstream parties mainly because of their crisis management and there 's support from russia for euroscepticism, 
  it 's just a rehearsal for our other elections in november meaning the focus is still on domestic politics, 
  we should use priests to heal us because we have so many of them lol like in old times when the priest was both doctor and teacher obviously joking,

  but we are not non-europeans, 
   one area where that could be particularly important is in negotiations over a sweeping new u.s.-e.u. 
  trade pact . 
  the obama administration has made the deal a priority , but europe 's far right and far left both adamantly oppose it , favoring closer economic ties with moscow instead . 
  could it be because putin wants the eu to have ft with russia instead ? 
  `` we propose the creation of a harmonious economic community stretching from lisbon to vladivostok , '' putin wrote in the piece . 
  `` in the future , we could even consider a free trade zone or even more advanced forms of economic integration . 
  the result would be a unified continental market with a capacity worth trillions of euros . '', 
  he said this in 2010 during his visit to merkel, 
   and of course , the ice church situated adjacent to that . . churches really are everywhere here  oh and from natural wonders . .

  if someone has problems with the link here is the full text bratislava , slovakia -- montenegro 's prime minister said he hopes the country will get an invitation this fall to join the north atlantic treaty organization despite new tensions between the west and russia , which views nato 's eastward enlargement as a strategic threat . 
  after five years of talks , montenegro , which emerged largely unscathed from the war following the breakup of yugoslavia in the 1990s and has a population of 650,000 people , could become the first new nato member since croatia and albania joined the alliance in 2009 . 
  `` for very clear reasons of our own , including achieving stability in the balkans through integration , we want to be part of nato , and this is n't a result of anti-russian positions , '' montenegro 's prime minister , milo djukanovic , said in an interview . 
  montenegro also hopes to be the next ex-yugoslavian republic after croatia and slovenia to join the european union moscow has criticized previous enlargements that moved nato 's eastern borders to those of russia and has tried to force former soviet republics back into its geopolitical sphere of influence . 
  after protests urging closer ties between the west and ukraine led to the ouster of president viktor yanukovych in february , russia annexed crimea and voiced support for separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  this month , a member of russia 's lower house of parliament , nationalist mikhail degtyarev , said montenegro could become `` a legitimate target of russian missiles '' if it joined the alliance . 
  the 28-member nato alliance said it remains committed to seek allies in the western balkans . 
  `` we see [ montenegro 's ] future in the euro-atlantic family , '' said nato 's secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen after his recent meeting with mr. djukanovic . 
  he did n't say whether a formal invitation to join the alliance would be made to montenegro at a nato summit to be held in september in wales . 
  the montenegrin prime minister said that russia 's stance against nato expansion wo n't stop montenegro from `` choosing its own path to the future , and that nato should allow new members to join regardless of russia 's objections . 
  `` i believe that nato should adhere to its policy of [ keeping ] its door open and all countries that wish to join and meet the necessary requirements should be able to become members of this club of countries which share a system of common values , '' he said . 
  mr. djukanovic has held senior government posts for the past 24 years , navigatingthe country through the dissolution of its 88-year federation with serbia in 2006 . 
  to join both the eu and nato , the country has been under pressure to step up its fight against corruption and organized crime , centered on seaborne smuggling of untaxed cigarettes to italy . 
  to promote his country 's nato bid , mr. djukanovic met u.s. vice president joe biden in washington last month . 
  before traveling to slovakia this week , mr. djukanovic met mr. rasmussen and visited poland . 
  `` it seems to us that due to a number of global issues , including the ukrainian situation , there may be a lack of attention in key nato capitals about montenegro 's aspirations , '' he said . 
  `` at one point we all became too relaxed and [ it ] seemed like the job was done and then came ukraine that woke us up , '' he said , adding that by building bridges among countries in the balkans , including through the nato enlargement , montenegro seeks to ensure security and stability in the region .
