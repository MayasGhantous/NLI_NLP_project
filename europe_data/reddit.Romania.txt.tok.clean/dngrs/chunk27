  which is why w/e putin plans with countries like this ( mine for ex ) must be done before the old people with ussr nostalgia die off if he considers their potential support important ( and i guess it is ) . 
  that 's like a couple of decades . 
  what does the pl government think of viktor orban ? 
  full #telleurope poll results : @tsipras_eu 50 % @guyverhofstadt 33 % @skakeller 10 % @martinschulz 5 % @junckereu 3 % #ep 2014, 
  afaik poland 's government is proshale, 
  nah they just want russia to come to them instead, 
   france was obviously an absolute monarchy ( the absolute monarchy perhaps ) . 
  france was a stable country but people do n't like being ruled by a dictator who puts himself above the law . 
  btw did n't the king there try to negotiate a constitutional formula but it was too late or something ? 
  great, 
   i 'm unsure how to reconcile the two . 
  how about having the eu put more focus on common military policies and eventually foreign too and obviously not siding with russia instead of the us like maybe some would like to, 
  elections here are a lot like prepresidentials http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124132, 
   the real danger that europeans are underestimating is that putin and russia have gotten a taste for this sort of thing . 
  that and his growing influence with eu members, 
  and with agitators like in ukraine we should invest in [ lic troops ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_intensity_conflict ), 
  apparently erdogan also hit someone http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1us72q_sok-goruntuler_shortfilms, 
  i guess the eu would be severely damaged but it would be much worse for russia . 
  related  there is much talk of sanctions on russia . 
  but sanctions can be countered and always ignore a key truth : russia has always been economically dysfunctional . 
  it has created great empires and defeated napoleon and hitler in spite of that . 
  undermining russia 's economy may be possible , but that does not always undermine russia 's military power . 
  that soviet military power outlived the economically driven collapse of the soviet union confirms this point . 
  and the issue at the moment is military . 
  you mean portugal 's ? 
  probably fish , tomato and wine . 
  i do n't support that . 
  ukraine respecting minorities well is just fine . 
  i guess foodstuffs means apples and food products means apple juice ? 
  well if you play with fire you can get burned, 
  funny how often the magyars side with the russians bad news for us, 
  they did say a week ago that they want to modernise their army, 
   france should do something about that - the eu needs them strong . 
  yes maybe more military exports to russia, 
  also q1 exports up by 10 % , industrial production by 9.6 % compared to last year 's march and the biggest company 's revenue ( dacia ) up by 45 % to 4.16 b eur compared to last year, 
  no comments from gdf , shell , e.on , enel , bp , omv and gazprom representatives yet, 
  but but ignorance and fear looks very good, 
   iirc . . gay marriage and prostitution too, 
  maybe he means picture 's left, 
  afaik they are kinda 50-50 split between eu and customs union, 
  is this used anywhere else by mainstream parties ? 
   romanian and our president said we would n't recognise any potential referendum of them to join romania again, 
  no games in chisinau ? 
  i mean using him to test reactions . 
  like in the recent episode . 
  what about rogozin ? 
  do you think putin uses him to test the public 's reactions ? 
  and van rompuy is visiting there, 
  long interesting article on this http://www.fpri.org//articles/2014/04/karpatalja-europes-next-crimea, 
  voice of russia maybe lol, 
  and slovakia said the same i think, 
  gipsy gipsy gipsy, 
  rogozin wants sanctions against us too, 
   maybe the russians should stop constantly testing the european patience . 
  putin would only understand a reply of strong force and he knows it wo n't come . 
  i doubt that rogozin fool acts by himself ( at least in this case ) . 
  i know it 's a joke but even at first glance we could n't because we do n't have unified military and foreign policy . 
  this is one of the big reasons why russia is so interested in promoting euroskepticism and playing their dividenconquer game with eu members . 
  in the eyes of the moscow elite , a strong eu is a big threat . 
   so , what do you think it will take to put the past behind us ? 
  russia giving up on it 's imperialist plans and having for many years prowestern politicians meaning aligning politically the same way with eastern european countries instead of trying to force them to join russia again ( there 's no real middle way imo ) but it 's almost impossible for a euromaidan to happen considering , among other strong factors , what a strong grip putin & co have there and how antiwestern russians are btw russia is badly seen here and morons like rogozin only try to keep it that way, 
  also chuck hagel might visit next month and rasmussen friday . 
  funny how they worry ( or pretend to ? ), 
  about russian influence in bulgaria but they do n't care about the ties berlin has, 
  they might be the main ones in the balkans but in europe there is also belarus btw they are trying to make allies among eu members like hungary and bulgaria,

  the regime in moscow is pretty much like that when considering the excommunist space, 
  sounds like putin has to come save him, 
  high, 
  he went there via romania apparently because he was denied to fly via ukraine ( which was denied by kiev . . poor victim of fascists ) rogozin said transnistria is under russia 's patronage and that there would be grave consequences for moldova if they signed with the eu . 
  last september he threatened to cut off moldova 's gas and afaik it did n't happen . 
  btw he 's banned from travel in the eu but he can transit hmm he also said we blocked him from flying ( our ban is apparently only for private planes and i guess this is what he used ) and that next time he will come onboard a bomber plane . . this guy is nuts, 
  concerned citizens !,
