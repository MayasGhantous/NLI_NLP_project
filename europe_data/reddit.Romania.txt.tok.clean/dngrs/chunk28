  weird not even the founding members have the day off, 
   and push for more dialogue between russia and the eu it is very obvious putin does not want to cooperate he would n't otherwise try to destabilise the eu by support the farright and build his own union to rival eu 's instead of being more liberal and in time maybe got russia to join it he 's following the same ambitions of the tsar peter i, 
  ours or theirs ? 
  so how much of swiss needs would be covered by this ? 
  is it for switzerland ? 
  k btw what do people there think about it , any reliable polls ? 
  do you want serbia to join eu ? 
   that does n't mean that some people will stop loving '' ` mother russia '' . 
  the politicians will have to . 
   so it is better not to stir things up . 
  but you will eventually have to if you join the eu . . unless russia ( it 's becoming more and more obvious that it will compete/fight more and more with the eu ) somehow gets prowestern political rulers which is unlikely, 
  is it me or there isnt much news on the debates ? 
  got anything on the april 29th one ? 
  / r/europics, 
  there 's no such as neutral . . not in this region anyway, 
   since the beginning of the crisis , brussels has demonstrated its appreciation of serbia 's delicate position in light of its close relations with russia , but with the reminder that an eu candidate country is expected to support european union policies . 
  i have the feeling they will play the same game even after membership . 
  you ca n't change 2 centuries old alignment so easily and russia , putin are very well seen there . 
  we have a weird saying here . . you ca n't have both d *** in ass and soul in heaven, 
   you 've said that if you do n't abolish the senate , the upper house of the italian parliament , that you 'll leave politics . 
  what deadlines have you set for yourself ? 
  details ? 
  we 've had a [ referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_parliamentary_reform_referendum,_2009 ) on that kind of thing in 2009 . . we 're still bicameral btw why is there really such a push for this ? 
  stuck on connecting for a while and then the connection has timed out, 
  doesnt work for me, 
  then cuza or carol, 
  unless they 'd have somehow good interest to do so ofc . 
  he was deputy from 2012 to sept 2013 when he quit to go as mep in someone 's place and now he wants to be deputy again . 
  he 'd love to be mp again for the protection from law it would bring .

  it also does n't really say that it will actually help in case of war  will take the actions it deems necessary http://www.nato.int/terrorism/five.htm they might just send some ammo and that 's it, 
   and , the whole defense spending is a useless debate : the eu spends more on defense than russia . 
  the problem is that it is scattered in 28 armies . 
  if the eu would double its defense spending then we would simply have 28 better funded , yet too small , armies . 
  but it 's hard to sell the idea of more europe when there are so many euroskeptics, 
  hmm i did n't know we spend double compared to hungary we 're going to raise spending btw, 
   countries fight against every bit of sovereignty they are forced to give up , so i doubt anyone is going to be handing over the keys to their tanks anytime soon , unless something radical happens like russia invades poland or aliens land in luxembourg . 
  yeah we might only do that after facing strong external threats,

  our government gave 57.000 euros so i 'm thinking not much money would be needed .

  anyway hail beargod zalmoxis !, 
   we should not owe allegiance to either of the two sides ( anymore ) we should kinda federalise then, 
  kinda like here with magyars . 
  a few rightwingers love to stir shit up . 
  not if you listen to russian propaganda, 
  this still applies today, 
  old people miss their youth, 
  a vampire impaled him, 
  not all left but few remain today, 
  it 's really interesting how putin uses snowden to push germany and other countries away from us influence . . and possibly towards russia instead . 
  i 'm a bit worried seeing this . 
  then there are the rightwing `` putinophiles '' in places like france and hungary , austria . 
  part of our media here likes to speculate that our socialdems would like to switch allegiance too . 
   former chancellor gerhard schr\u00f6der was seen partying with wladimir putin last week in st.petersburg , causing a major outbreak of criticism against him . 
  schr\u00f6der and putin have been close friends for a long time . 
   the speaker for foreign affairs of the cdu , phillip mi\u00dffelder , was also seen on the birthday party - he did not consult his ( political ) party or the government beforehand and is now claiming that he wanted to talk to the russians in this informal environment . 
  many want to see him gone now . 
  spiegel so are these `` rusophile '' politicians there really badly seen ? 
  any major criticism of gernot erler ? 
  do you think russian-german relations have been . . `` putin-ised '' ? 
  check my link one of those is marian, 
   and the population of turkey is 76 million imagine the influence turkish politicians could have in the ep, 
   one of the candidates for the european parliament spat on the eu flag during a meeting of the polish nationalists in warsaw . 
  u think he 's gon na spit on the money he can get as mep ? 
  yeah it 's funny how important we are to them that they keep spreading propaganda their voice of russia site even has a romanian language version, 
  great this was tried in moldova a couple years ago but the constitutional court did n't allow it, 
  they are n't negotiating membership ( so many people do n't understand this ) and there 's only the black sea in the way, 
  so the socialdems suddenly aligned with moscow . 
  i wonder if our ponta would do the same and be like orban . 
   would require a lot of people to be for it , 50 % +1 ? 
  any minimum turnout ?
