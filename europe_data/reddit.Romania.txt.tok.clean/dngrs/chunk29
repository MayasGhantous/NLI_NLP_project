   made himself look like a thug in the eyes of the world . 
  he 's actually very well seen in places like serbia and back in russia . 
  they are probably the biggest producers of cannabis in europe, 
  he 's interested in western balkans, 
  what did poroshenko say ? 
  so are we gon na see lots of refugees here soon ? 
  so . . proukraine factions held a meeting and they were attacked by separatists while police did nothing but was present . 
  then came the counter from proukraine factions which lead to the deaths in that building . 
  what does kiev say about the police in odessa ? 
  how is pes on this ? 
  wtf south slavia ? 
  we are n't slavs, 
  i thought it might be the swiss but i could n't figure out how :d, 
   that groups of young russians were seen entering moldova through chi\u0219in\u0103u and making their way into transnistria tourists / s, 
  what is ch ? 
  czech / hungary greece / lux sweden, 
  yeah the only more reliable news channel here is one that is privately owned but noncommercial, 
  bullshitmeter.gif and are they now admitting to influencing them ? 
  maybe the rest could try to join nato, 
  so anything going on right now in those areas ? 
   putin is n't going to attack the eu or nato not yet and not soon but russia is showing again that it is definitely not to be trusted and we , at least the eastern half of europe , really must have better preparations just in case, 
  yep http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.emp.totl.sp.zs, 
  not sure but it might be 9, 
  so it 's like kompot ? 
  the gipsies you see with riches in videos are a minority here too, 
   also , another 60 million euros will be provided to georgia to implement the association agreement . 
  kinda the same thing what i mean is that we are a lot alike, 
   i am really curious how bulgaria will look like in 20 years . 
  kinda like us you do know we compete with them at being the worst in the eu ? 
  so are debates like this every day of the week now ? 
  is there link for last night 's ? 
  btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_islam, 
  greece is very religious . 
  this should n't be a surprise . 
  btw [ religiosity in eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_belief_in_god.png ) and [ view on samesex marriage ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/publications/541-3.gif ) i suspect the situation in moldova to be the same . . maybe a bit worse http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_european_union are there any more recent polls on this stuff ? 
  costi ? 
  slavic romanians lol, 
  but arent they very prorussian ? 
  i dunno how sincere serbia is when it comes to the west but albania might join by then , who knows . 
  development of smaller countries can change quickly imo . 
  what does soros have to do with that ? 
  it 's a norwegian thing i think, 
  yeah albania is far ahead of moldova on this path . 
  it 's disappointing that euronews did n't upload something this important in hd, 
  no clue, 
  is this the rhetoric the communists use btw ? 
  it might be bad for us especially short term . 
  i mean what about the gas and oil and w/e they use ? 
  we 're thinking about sometime around the end of the decade, 
  i thought there might be some special eu fund ( or maybe from other places too ) for this but i 'm skeptical . 
  and i do n't think anybody important in bruxelles has even said anything about reunification which is understandable though because it pressures chisinau a lot right now . 
   we supply 30 % of albania 's ** electrical ** energy now right ? 
  i think that 's the backup option if they do n't get in the eu by the front door . 
  politicians do n't seem to support this . 
  well germans are best seen here, 
   but against the way `` western european '' states treat us . 
  meaning pressuring to keep anticorruption fight going which bothers psd a lot, 
   get the ukrainians out of the sweaty grip of the russians . 
  arent aa and dcfta enough for that though ? 
   he only real solution is reunification and then heavy investments from our part i doubt many people will agree that we must spend a lot there when we already dont have enough for us, 
  maybe they will learn from our mistakes  ) read find easier ways to steal funds, 
  probably later my guess is this step 1 : moldova joins eu step 2 : moldova makes great use of eu funds to catch up to us and after that we will try this, 
  can i see the article about this in english , pls ? 
  youtube link pls, 
  yeah like one of zidane 's kids, 
  they simply are not right in the head . 
  yeah afaik they wan na use turkey to lobby for them to join nato but officially they do n't want membership which is understandable because they are wary of russia but maybe recent events have made them look closer to nato btw they are negotiating aa with the eu, 
   ( of additional territory besides crimea ) i thought it was obvious, 
  not even barroso ? 
  for the frenchly challenged legend : red - do n't want to , orange - do n't want to because of economic reasons , yellow - have n't pronounced , pale green - agree but only in case of invasion , light green - agree , dark green - agree for security reasons we are yellow apparently because we do n't want to anger moscow and encourage them to put more pressure on chi\u0219in\u0103u . 
  we do n't depend much on russian energy , 21 % for gas . 
  this is just the government 's ( that is mainly socialdem ) view though because the president does n't like moscow . 
  gas dependancy map http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/visuel/2014/03/26/europe-et-russie-des-economies-dependantes_4390088_3214.html, 
  i thought u were going with alde, 
  i rather have a shawarma instead . 
  and one of ours , n\u0103stase , might get 1 year prison extension next week . 
  gon na watch it later :d takk, 
  is the debate later gon na be on youtube or something ? 
  so compared to ' 89 ? 
  there have been improvements without a doubt .
