  hmm this could be a good idea for a new thread series, 
  yes fascist , homosex orgies . 
  she also said something a few weeks ago about supporting self determination there not sure what it means . . 
  i think she wants the transnistria conflict solved . 
  yeah not soon but it can at least go for that damn common market how does the next energy commissioner think about this ? 
  oettinger was against it, 
  putin knows very well how democracy looks . 
   i 'm wondering , is n't there a way to get eu/un observers to make sure the next elections are actually done legally ? 
  they just ca n't send them everywhere, 
  btw there 's a video from pm ponta ( has highest chance to become the next president ) from the last presidentials in 2009 saying that ` the other 's fraud system was better than ours ' - they lost those, 
  it 's a lot more than ` respectful relations ' it 's not like we 're supposed to show putin our middle fingers, 
  why would they do that im sure they have nothing to hide / s, 
  so did they make some deal with russia ? 
  it 's not all gdp the main problem is that the eu is n't centralised enough there are problems mainly with forging a common foreign policy just look at how we deal with russia, 
   the mistake was believing he would ever keep the promises in the first place . 
  the whole `` there are no russian soldiers in crimea '' should have tipped her off to that . 
  she 's not naive . 
  she just does n't really care . 
  business with russia ueber alles . 
  same with italy and some other countries . 
   i guess europe is maybe the only sane superpower europe . . superpower lol, 
  bomb her, 
  it 's over 50 % in polls http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/, 
  judging by how our market works i would n't be surprised if prices would go up then just because, 
   but from my point of view , russia is only making europe better and stronger by creating a common enemy the eu will either turn much more stronger or much more weaker, 
   at least russia is evolving into a better place , um wut ? 
  i liked the taxes thing, 
  why is balkan music offensive ? 
   i have this crazy thought that erdogan wants to revive the ottoman empire fighting a stronger isis would be a good excuse to go full ottoman for erdogan to show so i think he wants them to be a bigger threat first and get turks to be more worried so they are more willing to accept erdogan 's plans putin already has a foreign force to go against . 
  erdogan is still working on it . 
  good job , putler !, 
   sure production is up , but how much is that benefiting the local people ? 
  gross average wage for dacia workers is ~ 3000 lei while country wide it 's ~ 2000\u00a0680/450 in euros, 
  no i asked about renault 12 in france obviously not in these times but back then, 
  it 's not a loop , silly . 
  keep trying . 
  they pay something like 374 btw we 're supposed to send for ~ 360 but there is still work on the pipes ( on their side i think ) and it would n't cover all that 's needed so they still need gazprom, 
   when russia is annoyed with moldova gas deal is being negociated and moldova wants it at least 5 bucks cheaper, 
   part of the design comes from france btw designs came from france even during communism ( obviously before dacia being sold ) [ renault 12 ] ( http://motoburg.com/images/renault-12-tl-06.jpg ) [ dacia 1300 ] ( http://allcarznews.com/data_images/gallery/01/dacia-1300/dacia-1300-07.jpg ) was renault 12 popular ? 
  same in russia i think, 
  well obviously extremists arent very mature people conflict is still conflict :d, 
  then fear of ( more ? ), 
  conflict with the ah empire ? 
  im too lazy to find the article it was on / r/geopolitics actually here it is http://www.fpri.org/articles/2014/09/third-chechen-war-islamic-states-imagined-qoqaz-caliphate-and-russias-fractious-ciscaucasia one example from the article  one of the more serious incidents occurred in june 2014 , when the new [ 44 ] leader of the imarat kavkaz , emir ebu muhammed , slighted musa abu yusuf al-shishani ( a/k/a umar al-shishani ) in an online video . 
  [ 45 ] al-shishani , a/k/a tarkhan batirashvili , is an ethnic chechen from georgia 's pankisi valley and is thought to be the military commander of the group islamic state . 
  [ 46 ] shishani 's followers quickly retaliated , branding as apostates [ 47 ] any who are not part of the islamic state and advising ebu muhammed `` to stay there in the caucasus and eat leaves . '' as one analysis put it : `` thus , the initiative of the new caucasus emirate 's emir , which could have resulted in achieving some form of reconciliation between the different factions of the north caucasus militants , ended up having the opposite effect and only heightened tensions among the groups . 
  as a result of this development , the isis accusation that other militants are apostates will only make reconciliation between isis and the other north caucasus rebel groups nearly impossible . 
  this is the first -- and a very important strategic blunder -- by the emir of the caucasus emirate since he was elected to his new position this past spring . '', 
  they actually dont get along so well, 
  1st one looks spanish for me and i see something red yellow above 13 on the plates source is spanish site https://www.foropolicia.es/foros/fotos-de-policias-del-mundo-t30111-1770.html . . seems to be french, 
  i 've seen it used often here and google got me lots of results rroma and rromani, 
  http://up.autotitre.com/9131806f46.jpg http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0sten_zulz4/hqdefault.jpg, 
  is n't roma with double r the pc one ? 
   this street alone , made me love sibiu . 
  there 's two parts of the city , the upper and lower , with ancient ramparts along the way . 
  it 's all tunnels and fortifications which is why the ottomans never were able to invade the city ( and perhaps why it 's so well-preserved ) . 
  more like because the [ carpathians ] ( http://www.romania-harta.ro/imagini/harti/harta-romania-engleza.jpg ) are in the way, 
  btw do mps have immunity everywhere in the eu ? 
   and ~ ~ wallachians . ~ ~ dacians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/origin_of_the_romanians, 
   production is still in romania . 
  part of it is in other parts too i think and they keep talking about leaving, 
  dacia renault is one of the very few successful privatizations, 
   i think the dutch police also uses them , really ? 
  btw ~ ~ spain ~ ~ , [ france ] ( http://up.autotitre.com/9131806f46.jpg ) , [ cz ] ( http://www.maks-ricany.cz/imgarchiv/duster.jpg ) use them, 
  i want source for that . 
  they do n't seem to be linking well with isis yet . 
  i 've read somewhere that the jihadists in the south have some problems with the ones in the caucasus . 
  something about the leadership there . 
  that 's when i 'd expect something bigger to happen, 
  it 's about being gay and nazi, 
  just a quarter ? 
  anyway just wait for jihad to start again in the caucasus, 
   its all down to : '' * will ukraine succeed economically * with the help of western powers or will they fail ? '', 
  while guess who continues to try to prevent that from happening just yesterday http://online.wsj.com/articles/russia-to-ban-all-fruit-and-vegetable-imports-from-ukraine-1413909569, 
  btw enel is being investigated http://business-review.eu/featured/enel-responds-to-charges-of-abusing-romanian-clients-money-65251 there 's a problem with them double taxing consumer green certificates which affected hundreds of thousands and the vicepresident of a state agency for energy reglementation seems to be crooked and involved with enel in some suspicious deals i 'm not sure how big the damages are . 
  show a purchasing power map then, 
  yeah i know that call it less bad than with other countries then, 
  they have good relations so they 're safe, 
  is data from belarus reliable ? 
  well that sucks, 
  what do you mean ? 
  i dunno if it will affect the elections much because the ones in power ( something like 65-70 % of parliament ) are almost always against lifting immunity and in times like this they try their best to delay anything they can in hrebenciuc 's case it might be another week or two until he is actually arrested as share of the media , most of it is siding with ponta so they focus on something else like on criticising the opposition this party had a pm sentenced a few years ago ( again this year in 2nd case i think ) and they still have much support so sentences do n't really affect them but in the next elections even a few % matter in the 2nd round, 
  the anticorruption agency asked parliament to remove immunity of 5 mps because they want to arrest them pre-trial 1 is hrebenciuc ( mp since ' 96 ) who just quit parliament today ( btw he said he will be back in 2016 . . the bastard ) another one also from the main ruling party ( psd ) got decision in parliament delayed because too few mps came to work ( done on purpose to gain another week time ) hehe psd should think about making party headquarters in jail in the next couple of weeks we should see what happens to the other 3 ( 1 psd and exminister , 1 pc also ruling party , 1 unpr same ) there is visible conflict now between various groups of crooks in psd new investigation today of another deputy in 1m euros damages case about tax evasion with oil products from bulgaria, 
  i 'm surprised putler did n't win the nobel for peace . 
  last spring and sent by the deputy chief of their lower chamber of parliament ( duma ), 
  btw this might have to do more with moldova negotiating this month extending contract with gazprom and wanting price at least 5 bucks cheaper they pay 374 per thousand m ^ 3 the pipeline we built is n't finished on their side and the gas would cover only around half their needs i think so it 's blackmail, 
  i do n't like the politicians . 
  tldr hrebenciuc ( high rank psd mp ) is investigated in 3 cases all appearing this month 1 about influence peddling over the national audiovisual council ( very biased institution ) to give back licence to a tv channel owned by another crooked politician 2nd also corruption related accusations in a 300m euros damages case about illegal restitutions of 43,000 hectares of forestry - along with the father in law ( also mp ) of the pm who wants to be president and another psd mp ( ex judge ) , 2 judges and i think some magyar politicians but i 'm not sure 3rd the newest one : influence peddling again - he would help sova become party leader if he would help initiate a law which would pardon investigated politicians ( it was tried again a few months ago and it failed because of much foreign criticism / they have a problem with a law because of which ex pm nastase and current minister dragnea got investigated / there may be some involvement with the justice minister too ) . 
  there are transcripts of sova telling hrebenciuc that he needs to be justice minister for this and he ca n't if he has a case opened which he does . 
  it 's the 2nd case for sova ( first one about abuse in office because his law firm got suspicious contracts with state firms ) hrebenciuc was told by an ex chief of a secret service ( who knew from a mole in the anticorruption agency ) that he was being investigated, 
  gopnik ( russian : \u0433\u043e\u0301\u043f\u043d\u0438\u043a ) ( plural gopniki , gopota , gopari ) is a sub-culture native to russia and post-soviet countries, 
  it kinda is there are around a hundred rare birds species so it is pretty nice http://www.feeder.ro/2013/05/30/delta-din-vacaresti-fotografii/ https://www.facebook.com/pages/parcul-natural-v%c4%83c%c4%83re%c8%99ti/539076059491083?sk=photos_stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrz5pvpxbks, 
  sikorski talked about russia 's offer in april http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/talking-with-polands-foreign-minister-about-the-ukraine-crisis-and-russias-next-moves/2014/04/17/f1811e84-c5ad-11e3-bf7a-be01a9b69cf1_story.html saying it was sent the month before meaning march, 
  russia sent proposals to romania and hungary too, 
  lol when was it even on ? 
  why remove us ? 
  that 's in paint , right ? 
  :d it looked like that for me so i used gimp ( free ) instead, 
  does it ban the communist party including ( at least high ranking ) exmembers ? 
  i wish we had lustration,
