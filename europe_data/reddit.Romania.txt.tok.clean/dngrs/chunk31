  why do you like them ? 
  putin, 
  that + german french and portuguese, 
  we should export some maybe the godless fins want them ? 
  pretty much the same and the separatist kind of bs comes from moscow 's puppets, 
  anything about berthelot ? 
   ukraine not even in moldova ? 
  i would n't be surprised if the gitanos do n't like the \u021bigani . 
  oh well lots of romanians left for spain, 
   i do n't know how , but they have some freaky financial connections in spain . 
  details ? 
  i wonder how much of albania 's energy will be covered by what we sell there, 
  i was expecting something like this to be the reason . 
  what does merkel say about this ? 
  ok so we have the same word, 
  cool, 
  thats more like the effect than the reason imo, 
  vlach magic, 
  1st after s. korea iirc, 
  www.travlang.com/money/bulg1000.jpg http://merrypenny.com/content/currency/what-is-bgn/bulgaria-lev.jpg http://www.sagafi.net/images/currencies/bulgaria_lev100%28front%29.jpg notice the lions, 
  you can go further back with that to goths and til kohler is bessarabian, 
  http://imgur.com/t3yvmvq + titus anton instead of anthony and besides blaise they are quite common, 
  german language is quite popular in some parts there, 
  i 've heard chinese companies tend to bring their own workers for works in other countries . 
  this was in some documentary on russia . 
  anything from latin america ? 
  same for bulgars, 
  that kolo stuff sounds and looks really familiar and i think some of that magic can still be found around here too, 
  flag pls ? 
   ukraine has already struck similar deals with hungary and poland . 
  afaik we are arranging something similar too, 
  your karma !, 
  i wonder from where we will get our immigrants from . 
  if ofc :d demographics problems and all that, 
  btw fakaturi means fake stuff here ( at first glance because i dont really know the etymology here ), 
  why not `` dacia '' ? 
  another question what do you learn in school about us ? 
  no replies so i guess nothing, 
  btw do u have gipsies of ur own in poland ? 
  are those seen better ? 
  quality per lion, 
   practice magic more info pls, 
  yep, 
  why do you think vlachs are weird ? 
  [ part of the problem ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-682598-breitwandaufmacher-pljq.jpg ), 
  also what would be the chances of something like this to happen again ? 
  they are not gon na be eu member tomorrow not even this decade this isnt about eu membership btw they arent even candidates http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_partnership http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union  these states would be offered full integration short of membership , but no enlargement would be on the agenda in the short to medium term . 
  communist propaganda is still strong, 
  maybe because it would encourage the eurosceptics in other countries too ? 
  for some reason i thought russia is unicameral, 
  from the local magyar party http://ampress.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/oua-verzi-udmr-paste-catolic1-350x4181.jpg thats their logo, 
  ~ 300 thousand many in londongrad, 
  should we have more threads like this ? 
  maybe a daily one what happened to the `` what do you know about x country '' ? 
  they are n't . . visible here . 
  there were some bad relations with them in the middle ages but later in the 20th century we had a nice military alliance ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93romanian_alliance ) with them and a couple others ( little entente ) . 
  we helped them send their bank 's gold west in 1939 ( there 's even a romano-polish movie on this but no english subs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjzhbm6joni ) and beyond this we did n't have important relations with . 
  few poles live here , a few thousands which is down from 80000 in the 30s . 
  numbers changed when we lost northern bukovina and bessarabia . 
  i think most people have a neutral view . 
  maybe you require assistance from our socialdems ? 
  how much does austria depend on russian energy ? 
  oil gas everything are there many politicians there prorussian like the farright in other places ? 
   if you 're looking to move your country , i suggest you share border with hungary , they 're the best neighbours  lolwut ? 
  pretty much all you said does n't apply here, 
   ( though croats also fill that description so i guess there 's two ) . 
  why ? 
   russia in fact just wants to help russians in ukraine , but no . 
  lol, 
  what do you mean ? 
  why would they change it when it works for them and there 's no public pressure ? 
  parties only seem to care about principles when they are in opposition and actually they do it too anyway, 
  it does take a couple of days or so to make it . 
  mmm crepe with bacon sounds good, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_orthodox_church_%28moscow_patriarchate%29  uoc is an autonomous church of eastern orthodoxy in ukraine , under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the moscow patriarchate . 
  same for the moldovan church there 's also the bessarabian church under romanian patriarchate and it 's considered schismatic by the moldovan and russian ones, 
  looks familiar, 
  i could have bet it 's paprika . 
  thanks :d, 
  it might not be common in the eastern half . 
  whats next to the salt ? 
  i do n't think that 's why . 
  it 's because it takes a lot of time to make . 
  or some oil, 
  1 2 3 same but smigus never heard about it, 
  on maundy thursday some people make a small fire in front of each burial http://zoom.mediafax.ro/people/traditii-de-paste-12489860/imaginea-1#foto or they bring a candle http://zoom.mediafax.ro/people/traditii-de-paste-12489860/imaginea-21#foto some wine is poured over crosses, 
  is that barbeque on the balcony ? 
   eggs can be dyed by boiling them in water containing red onion peel . 
  that 's the traditional method here too but more and more people just buy special egg paint, 
   kutia we have that for easter too but it seems like only villagers make it anymore we call it coliv\u0103 and i like it a lot http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/coliva_in_biserica_01.jpg, 
  u sure ? 
  it 's the variety with turkish delight another kind has cocoa , raisins and nuts,
