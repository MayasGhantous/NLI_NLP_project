  not here, 
  the current plan is to sign in june , right ? 
  we should make a thread about european easter eggs, 
  who said it is ? 
   for 20 years the country was bled by corruption , just 20 ? 
   the people who should be most worried by what they have heard from the kremlin are the countries that have large concentrated russian minorities . 
  socialdems 72 % but there is no way i will vote for them, 
  they already are, 
  yeah russification, 
  it 's much better to have a monarch with a simple role than the crooks we dumbass romanians keep voting for president there 's too much instability and scandal , current examples : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/10770522/romanian-prime-minister-leaves-his-office-because-of-presidential-spying.html http://xml.agerpres.ro/news-of-the-day/2014/04/14/ponta-we-will-file-criminal-complaint-against-president-basescu-tomorrow-16-49-49 things like this are common and not new at all the royal house is well seen here constantly improving it 's image but still only around a quarter of romanians would like to have monarchy again ( though keep in mind that there 's communist propaganda still deeply set in many people 's minds ), 
  our king is not like the one you describe, 
  that would be surprising . 
  i doubt it 's all over . 
  let me check my crystal ball, 
  not here, 
  you dont have it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:blankmap-world6_national_days.svg, 
  i do n't think you have an independence day . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/blankmap-world6_national_days.svg i 'm talking about countries in blue . 
  from wiki 20 august 1000 -- the foundation of the hungarian state by saint stephen , celebrated as a national day in hungary . 
  1083 - canonization of the first king of hungary , saint stephen and his son saint emeric . 
  that ca n't be why because you could just pick the day of it becoming official . 
  wth where is that from ? 
  so yes, 
  the mother-in-law of the balkans :d, 
   do you wish to live somewhere else ? 
  you want them back in siberia ? 
  are many serbians really prorussian ? 
  i got redirected there too . 
  i do n't think it 's malware . 
  looks like our zacusc\u0103, 
  i did n't know the cabano\u0219i are polish . 
  til :d, 
  i love this too . 
  it 's a very popular street food in these parts and quite healthy if you get it without fries and mayo/ketchup . 
  it 's of turkish origin afaik, 
  is it cheating if i pick something already popular here ? 
  kinda like a national ( though more like balkanic or bigger ) dish :d [ bulgarian sarma ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/53/e2/64/53e264348b049452ff6719fcd6e63a9e.jpg ) this is great with sour cream over it , a pickled hot pepper and [ \u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430 ] ( http://www.ismena.bg/imagedepo/all_other/devinski_kachamak.jpg ) instead of bread otherwise [ \u0219aorma ] ( http://nutritionist.info.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/shaorma.jpg ), 
   do european countries just play volleyball with gypsies , constantly tossing them over the other side hoping they do n't come back ? 
  yep afaik they stay here a while and then they return, 
  afaik the queen of yugoslavia isnt really known here the other maria ( her mum and wife of ferdi ) is the popular one, 
  i ca n't tag all russia in a certain way but i never viewed moscow in a good light and this has not changed . 
  btw , a poll last october showed that russians are among the most negatively seen peoples by romanians . 
  pic http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2013/10/13/525adc04c7b855ff563290c9/627x0.jpg i 'd expect them to be seen even more badly now, 
  where did you get this from ? 
  local news ? 
   it would be sensible to keep them for another year or two more like a decade or two, 
  psd ( social dems ) senator sorin laz\u0103r got 6 months suspended sentence for conflict of interests because he hired his son in his parliamentary office sentence not final but he pleaded guilty this is a quite common practice and there are others mps who do the same currently btw he 's still senator and i doubt he will quit because nobody sees a problem with things like this ie : another senator and exminister btw tudor chiuariu ( pnl - libs he 's also vicepresident there ) got a sentence in january for abuse against public interests and . . he 's still senator though not head of the justice commission anymore, 
  i like them too . 
  hmm no alde in like 7 countries :\\ whats going on ? 
  no problems here . 
  the only thing on the radar is the greater romania party and they have n't been in the local parliament since 2008 . 
  some polls last year showed that they get around 3 % support and our law requires 5 % . 
  i do n't expect them to get any euro mps . 
  they got 8.6 % ( 3 seats ) in the last euros : one of them switched to socialdems and another went to prison a while ago . 
  they had quite a lot of visibility 99 % because of their old leader vadim ( the 3rd e-mp and tabloids still love him ) but he was replaced by some kinda unknown guy so i do n't expect them to get any other emp . 
  they seem to not be prorussian . 
   plagiarism our pm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victor_ponta#plagiarism_controversy in february this year a state secretary in the education ministry was fired after it was found out that she plagiarised her dissertation, 
   second , the eastern region may decide to proclaim itself the `` true ukraine '' and , with russian backing , launch an offensive against the central government in kiev to re-establish viktor yanukovych 's `` legitimate '' presidency . 
  the scenario is barely new since it was fully employed in 1918 when the bolsheviks created a puppet `` ukrainian '' government in kharkiv to overthrow the democratic government of the ukrainian national republic ( 1918-1920 ) in kiev . 
  the main advantage of the scenario is to disguise a russian-ukrainian war as a ukrainian-ukrainian war . 
  this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_people%27s_republic ? 
  i 'm not sure if prm is still hostile towards russia . 
  they 've had a new leader since last summer and he 's not well known so i dunno what he thinks about this . 
  . . only 3 countries in the eu dont have a notable prorussian farright group :\\, 
  yeah . 
  now all there 's left is . . for ukraine to accept ? 
  any signs from the government there ? 
  lol, 
  yep http://www.nineoclock.ro/constanta-mayor-radu-mazare-detained-for-bribe-taking/ and the pm is criticised for supporting mazare and others like him that have problems with the law btw in how many other cases is this guy investigated ? 
  it has n't appeared yet , right ? 
  cant find it, 
  how can i see how the mps voted on this ? 
   dont desparit it wouldnt be a problem if we knew we had no potential and even if that was the case it 's still terrible to have problems at grassroots ( ? ), 
  level, 
  the motherinlaw of the agriculture minister investigated for taking bribe celebration 96 years since the adoption of the declaration of the union of bessarabia with romania 10 years of nato membership doha world cup gymnastics gold, 
  wtf, 
  and in return klitschko gets support from poroshenko ? 
  dunno why :d ask the dacians ? 
  i guess some of the kings back then tried to unify thracians which occupied a big part of this zone . 
  later the descendants of them ( romanians ) tried to keep the territories that were part of dacia . 
  if you look at maps you will see it 's more or less the same . 
  i 've heard it once spread into central europe ( austria ) in burebista 's time but i do n't really know . 
  we survived the empires around fairly well . 
   almost 240k it was even almost 300k in the interbelic era, 
  what does it say for romania ? 
  maybe they need some foreign threat to force them to somehow bind :\\, 
  how do polls look for the kiev elections ? 
   i do n't think they like each other too much . 
  that 's good , right ? 
  what do you think of poroshenko ? 
  are there any polls done for voting just between poroshenko and klitchko ( 2nd round of elections ) ? 
  how is poroshenkos relationship with tymoshenko ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_presidential_election,_2014#first_round interesting evolution for klitchko and poroshenko would klitchko drop more ? 
   selfproclaimed yeah but didnt they get recognition from president iliescu and other officials back in ' 92 ? 
  some pics static2.libertatea.ro / uploads/tx _ images/5 _ 18b080.jpg http://www.ziarulnatiunea.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/646x4041.jpg http://www.gicacontra.eu/img/cioaba-iulian.jpg http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40173000/jpg/_40173793_gypsy_king_203.jpg, 
   tradition this has been going on since the 90s, 
  again ? 
  i find it suspicious that parties like jobbik and fn are close to moscow . 
  i wonder if far-right movements like this get any money from russia . 
  i know .
