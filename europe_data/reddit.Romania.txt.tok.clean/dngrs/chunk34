  how is this calculated ? 
  but he doesnt sparkle, 
   i 've read some quotes from 18xx-1915 - it 's like people described today 's situation same feeling when reading caragiale 's stories or eminescu 's articles . 
  yep http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=plxp_vhe0gg#t=32 good footage of the road here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0rgrsgzys8, 
   doens ' t romania also have the largest area of intact nature in europe ? 
  outside russia http://wwf.panda.org/?202118/wwf-acts-to-save-europes-last-remaining-virgin-forests this is one of the areas if anyone wants to visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retezat_national_park and another one here http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=rom+01, 
  you can go much farther back than communism, 
   what policies initially kinda none lol it developed wild which turned out to be a great thing, 
  1st but we have a problem with internet availability in rural areas which is half the country . 
  below ministers it 's all the same . 
  nope . 
  you mean if there 's more corruption ? 
  i guess he has many things to do so he 's taking leave . 
  i wonder what he 's up to . 
  older link but still applies . . this story is too new to find on foreign sites, 
  i wonder if we will end up trying to get immigrants from somewhere else , likely outside the eu . 
  our current one might have some problems too next year, 
  ~ 480 euros, 
   some . 
  200 years of russian influence have had a bit of influence . 
  meaning they drink more, 
  there might be some eu funds for this or maybe some of the general ones would be enough first thing is for moldova to join the eu otherwise it 's very unlikely to happen, 
  i 've seen only the 7th seal , clockwork orange and trainspotting . 
  they 're great . 
  yeah if it goes well then we might see other experiments like this in other regions, 
  and they might try again next month, 
  tomorrow extransports minister fenechiu could get a prison sentence too, 
  there are elections next year and they fear ukip so they want to attract some votes from their electorate, 
  it 's a very small group, 
   my opinion is that the claims to throne of the former king michael ( or his offspring ) as illegitimate they are n't claiming restoration, 
  same here called `` salata de boeuf '', 
  we also have this `` middle name '' but it 's actually set as the 3rd one . 
  it 's sometimes picked by the godfather and it 's often a saint name .

  reminds me of something regarding a football game a few years ago a club owner paid the players of another team to play to their best i mean * to not * throw the game ( or thats just that owners view because he got into some trouble for that ), 
  over 6000 in romania in the last 2 years, 
  can you explain , pls ? 
   christmas is a christian holiday it might have some prechristian roots though, 
   ... which brings me onto my next point . 
  londonders are assholes . 
  i have the feeling that capital cities tend to be that way . 
  it 's more like `` eu , you want tymoshenko ? 
  i 'll give you khodorkovsky instead '', 
  yeah , i doubt the money they send back will make up for the losses especially medium-long term . 
  the main issue i see is that we wo n't have enough workforce to pay pensions after a decade or two . 
  keep in mind that most of the people that have left are fairly young ranging between 26 to 40 yo . 
  i 'm talking about more than 2 million people , 10 % of the total population , which went somewhere else , mostly west , in just the last couple of decades and are unlikely to come back . 
  afaik he has not made it yet, 
  i really doubt they would vote for that . 
  our feeling of nationalism is fairly low even when there are problems with the magyars , imo . 
  they just need as many votes as possible and the votes from diaspora are the best for them because the people away are often less informed than the ones back home and so propaganda is more effective . 
  care to explain the difference pls ? 
  some months ago they were laying asphalt here in romania during rain videos : http://www.romaniatv.net/muncitorii-din-neptun-au-asfaltat-pe-o-ploaie-torentiala-video_29287.html http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scwlgecbb9y, 
  passports or citizenship ? 
   we hear the stories here that romania is going to chop a part of our country . 
  details pls ah i guess it has to do with snake island . . 
  i doubt it has something to do with northern bucovina and maramures too . 
   i do n't see a united army as an option anytime soon yeah unless there is a big enough foreign threat to force them to unify, 
  just to ease protesters i guess, 
  i agree with that . 
  i 'm not naive at all , i 'm just calling it as it really is and if everybody does it does n't mean it 's ok . 
  yes blackmail should bring no shame, 
   i honestly think he is a bit schizophrenic `` in our age there is no such thing as ` keeping out of politics . ', 
  all issues are political issues , and politics itself is a mass of lies , evasions , folly , hatred and schizophrenia . '', 
  george orwell, 
  i 'm fine with it if it means significantly lowering russian foreign influence in these parts . 
  it 's going to be a bumpy ride though . 
  the prorussians seem to be disappointed in yanukovich too, 
  apparently they tried to negotiate gas price http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25278984, 
  i think they 'll find a way to negotiate, 
  uhm they need 2/3ds of the parliament for this to be done so it 's unlikely unless there will be some attractive things included in the constitution to make it agreeable for the communists . . 
  i guess it 's not against the constitution since it 's the const . 
  court who decided this now . 
  got no idea how this works . 
  afaik it 's not official yet because the constitution must be modified, 
  it 's not surprising considering the other option, 
  i do n't think there 's a way for them to ask for this especially if the company is profitable . 
  the socialdems , who are the bigger party btw , were always close with china . 
  and china is n't reeeally communist anymore . 
  do n't gipsies get 1 representative automatically ( or something like that / actual method - ethnic minorities are also entitled to one deputy if their candidate gets at least 10 % of the average vote needed to elect a member of parliament . ), 
  there ? 
  i guess it 's not enough , there are talks here from time to time that they should form some kind of party like the magyars have . 
  here the bigger minorities get one each ( 17 of them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_ethnic_minorities_parties ) while the magyars have their own party ( 26 mps ), 
  is british food borrowing anything from immigrants ' food culture ? 
  i guess they adapt too well . 
  why do n't people like you understand that the other option is worse ? 
  it 's early to talk about this and i doubt we 'd finance much of it ourselves . 
  yes , it 's only a matter of time . . unless moldova ends up in the eurasian union . 
  even with moldavian reunion it 's still very unlikely imo, 
  yep and only ~ 20-30k remain today, 
  i think he meant saxons and schwabs ( the later mostly in banat region afaik ), 
  it 's the lesser evil and i doubt they can stay out of both eu and russia 's spheres of influence, 
  afaik they will sign everything , all pages . 
  iirc thats what their minister ( or our foreign relations one ) or pm or some ambassador of theirs said, 
  194  112 how did they win ? 
  was the vote about keeping berlusconi ? 
  how many voted for this ? 
  one without timer pls, 
  is there a quiz for all countries ? 
  97 % 1misclick on slovenia and screwed up on latvia and kosovo ( clicked albania ),
