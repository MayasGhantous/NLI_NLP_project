  i wonder how they would handle world maps ... 
  yep, 
  kinda the same here with some szeklers, 
  2 drunkards, 
  lol wtf, 
  this sounds familiar, 
  funny thing iirc it was voronin 's group who started all the negotiations in the first place some years ago, 
  it 's not over yet, 
  lots of people might just be apathic when it comes to politics even on special matters like this it 's very hard to draw many people here too regardless of weather, 
  afaik most are leaning west i mean ~ half are for joining the eu totally and ~ 2/3s for partial membership like just free trade and that kind of stuff, 
  the good bit from this might be that bruxelles will now focus even more on moldova because it seems that if this one does n't join either then the eastern partnership plan totally failed . 
  what 's the status on armenia , azerbaijan , belarus and georgia ? 
  afaik they do n't look likely to sign anything . 
  i would n't be surprised if russia would now blackmail the ukraine even more . 
  very hard to say but i think it 's somewhere in the eastern half of europe . 
  maybe russia or hungary . 
  around 0.52 eur, 
  they could have been much longer . . haha, 
  hmm your mafias dump it in italy ? 
  i thought they used just other countries , like mine . 
  i think it helps to get that area to the same standards with romania more easily, 
  first they must actually join the eu and solve the problems with transnistria and gagauzia and they must also make great use of eu funds ( and maybe something specific ) because the difference in development is pretty big and reunification might mean more problems for romania . 
  politicians here are all ( except the magyars because more romanians would mean problems for their party to get the 5 % - usually only the magyars vote for the magyar parties and there are n't many magyars in moldova - needed for parliament which is very difficult anyway . . that 's the main reason / other minorities get 1 member guaranteed but magyars have their own party often in power too ) for it ( though i do n't see them in a hurry to make the necesary bilateral monetary , economic and energy treaties . . 
  i guess they are waiting for them to join the eu first or it would be in vain ) and most people too but in moldova , right now , not so much but i think enough of them will be for it after some years of looking west . 
  maybe around the end of this decade it would be done, 
   how is the bulgarian government dealing with the protests ?? 
  they respond by having the protesters beaten up, 
  it 's also very difficult if you want to run independent, 
  i was n't meaning you , sorry . 
  chauvinism again, 
  details pls, 
  do your politicians use agitators there ? 
  there was one local sociamdem boss recorded a few months ago telling some people how to `` protest '' . . iirc it had to do with shale gas or ro\u0219ia montana, 
  or with this http://www.culinare.ro/storage/reteta/sarmale.jpg stuffed cabbage rolls http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/romanianmaincourses/r/stuffed-cabbage-sarmale.htm, 
  it seems to be the same, 
  this does n't have subs, 
  there are too many high level corrupt fucks so they are trying to take each other out to make some room, 
  yeah we really got the government we needed back in communism, 
  there 's some coming from us too afaik, 
  next they will make a general mining law that will again be tailored for rmgc http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/12/romania-goldmine-idusl5n0ix0u520131112, 
   and only change the meaning of that republic , defined somewhere else in the constitution what do you mean ? 
  yeah first brand new constitution is needed, 
  here 's a search by keyword bear on this site http://www.ziare.com/stiri/urs/stiri/, 
  - monarchist march organised today asking for a new constitution ( the current one declarest the country a republic and does not allow this to change and a brand new one would be needed which might kinda be unconstitutional ) article 1 ( 2 ) the form of government of the romanian state is a republic . 
  article 152 ( 1 ) the provisions of this constitution with regard to the national , independent , unitary and indivisible character of the romanian state , ** the republican form of government ** , territorial integrity , independence of justice , political pluralism and official language ** shall not be subject to revision ** . 
   you only own the surface , not what 's found beneath . 
  same here afaik some peasants ' farming land was ruined by some foreign company looking for gas or something, 
  a tourist was killed just a month ago by a bear, 
  and `` the mistre\u021bi '' is `` mistre\u021bii '' / singural is `` mistre\u021bul '', 
  ofc, 
  he 's 1.70, 
  i like both albania 's and sweden 's the most . 
  putin looked nervous http://www.reuters.com/video/2013/11/08/dutch-king-meets-russias-putin?videoid=274468906, 
  if anybody cares here are pictures of the royal lunches he holds every year with various politicians and civil society members to celebrate both his nameday and birthday http://www.princeradublog.ro/jurnal/pranz-oficial-la-palatul-elisabeta-5-noiembrie-2013/ http://www.princeradublog.ro/jurnal/inalti-reprezentanti-ai-romaniei-si-republicii-moldova-invitati-de-regele-mihai-la-palatul-elisabeta/ and a video from today 's public event https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twunj2njksu, 
  the eiffel tower was partly built with steel made in romania and the designer learned from engineer gheorghe panculescu about some metallurgy technology that he later used to build the tower . 
  45 % and some of them were random clicks, 
  and how would that cancel that treaty ? 
  til very interesting, 
  - italian poacher caught with more than 5000 lark birds ( foreigners seem to love poaching here ) - first run of the 3rd episode of the wild carpathia documentary ( actually the first run was in london a while ago ) - this year tennis player simona halep reaches wta ranking 11 her highest so far and might be romanian sportsperson of the year . 
  this year she won her first tournaments @nurnberg , 's - hertogenbosch , budapest , new haven and moscow . 
  le she also won the tournament in sofia today - in arges county 3000 hectares of woodland were cut illegally although they were in a protected area and this happened just in the last few years . 
  between 2005 and 2011 local reports show that over 170 000 hectares of woodland and over 350 000 hectares in the last 2 decades were cut illegally . 
  on the church pic whats that orange in north of italy ? 
  this remembers me of the young szeklers here that do n't bother learning romanian and then complain about not having a job is n't this a chauvinistic attitude ? 
  they won this year 's rugby antim cup :(, 
   surnames that end in - shvili ( possibly a grammatical ending ) . 
  yeah , i do n't understand why they bother so much with geting visas lifted . 
  there 's already too much braindrain ie in the last 6 years 20 000 medics left the country . 
  to get a picture of how much a big deal that is , the european average of medics/1000 people is 3.6 while ours is 1.9 and we have ~ 40 000 doctors left here while we need at least double . 
   their mythology is based on fire , or something like that . 
  yeah linked to zoroastrianism, 
  yeah it would take a long time, 
  the first modern oil refineries were built there in the 19th century and back then it produced almost almost all of the world 's oil . 
  industrialist alfred nobel had business there . 
  tokes fan ? 
  it wo n't be a problem if they join the eu and absorb much of the funding they give but that 's a big if . 
  the `` plan '' ( if there is any ) is that moldova should first join the eu and develop with good use of european funds to make a reunion actually achievable i suspect there might be some eu help specifically for a reunion, 
  1-0 away would be great, 
  woah zlatan v cr7 are they suspended for that game ? 
  i wonder what would happen to the communist party there . 
  yeah 29 % of romanians like it http://www.caleaeuropeana.ro/sondaj-inscop-ungurii-si-rusii-primii-in-topul-antipatiei-la-romani/, 
   romanian city given as an example of interethnic coexistence in europe reminds me of sulina of the 19th century . 
  it had a fairly even mix of romanians , greeks , lipovans , turks , jews , armenians and other peoples . 
  christians , muslims and jews were buried in the same cemetery . 
  it was a small village back then but it had a lot of potential as a port so after the development done by westerners ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commissions_of_the_danube_river ) , the place turned into a prosperous city and attracted even more diversity . 
  ceta ? 
  a nvm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comprehensive_economic_and_trade_agreement, 
  short story : chevron is starting exploration drilling on a 20km surface area in vaslui county . 
  a few hundred villagers are protesting and the jandarmerie is a bit zealous . 
  state officials from the local mayor to anybody else are acting like they represent chevron , not the people ( same in rmgc 's case ) . 
  google translate http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fadevarul.ro%2flocale%2fvaslui%2fprotest-lant-uman-pungesti-chevron-1_525e7812c7b855ff5643713b%2findex.html&amp;act=url protests going on right now in bucuresti and cluj against chevron found some foreign links http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/16/police-disperse-anti-fracking-protesters-at-chevron-exploration-site-in-romania/ http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/10/16/2783101/fracking-romania/ oh and the school inspectorate - or w/e it is in english - has forbidden kids and teachers to participate in the protests http://activenews.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/isj-vaslui-interzice-elevilor-participarea-la-protest-600x330.jpg picture of their message 5 protesters in vaslui were brought to hospital and one died because of heart problems ( not 100 % sure if he died ), 
   it was like that since they killed ceausescu . 
  you can go much further back than that, 
  yeah like the streisand effect, 
   history never repeats itself but it would be a grave error to learn no lesson from it . 
  `` history does not repeat itself , but it does rhyme . '', 
  - mark twain, 
  this remembers me of the 2009 pres. 
  elections when ponta ( social dem / psd back then spokesperson for psd 's candidate geoana ) said that pdl ( dem-libs ) 's fraud system `` was better '' after basescu ( dem lib candidate ) won .
