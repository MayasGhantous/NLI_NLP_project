   tripe soup http://www.themidlandhostel.com/the-famous-romanian-tripe-soup-recipe-in-english/ http://romanian-cuisine.blogspot.ro/2011/03/tripe-soup-ciorba-de-burta.html, 
  and today gagauzia 's parliament decided to ban the terms romanian history , language and literature http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.publika.md%2flimba-romana-a-fost-interzisa-in-gagauzia_1617061.html, 
  ah , yes . 
  i forgot . 
   basescu said rogozin was used to `` making a statement about romania every morning before having tea . '', 
  and he added '' ... or ... something else '' hinting to alcohol i think great diplomacy, 
  check out a bit of the history of that service http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_intelligence_service sample `` the jurnalul na\u021bional newspaper fired its editor-in-chief , valentin zaschievici , in august 2012 , accusing him of being an infiltrated sri agent , following the leak of some sri documents by cotidianul . 
  the romanian intelligence service admitted that the documents were indeed genuine , but it claimed that their agent was only monitoring the leaking of secret documents to the press . '', 
  yeah much above average, 
  it is for the ones whose business is affected they already complain about everything, 
  a sheep or two lol a few times a year they kill a few tens of sheeps on each occassion the shepherds do have dogs but they are n't always effective, 
  the wolves are sometimes quite devastating to livestocks though, 
  ca n't you guys `` import '' some wolves , boars and bears from us ? 
  better organizing, 
  yeah that 's what the balkans need, 
  only one way to actually find out ... 
  they are already looking to import more from romania and other places, 
  banned wine and keeps sending back fruit and vegetables imports from june-august alone they sent back 250 tonnes today or yesterday another 19 tonnes to note : the agriculture sector there accounts for ~ 16 % of their gdp ( $ 1.1 billion ) and the losses from the wine embargo ( ca n't find figures for the other stuff ) for this year are ~ $ 40mil but last year it was ~ $ 200 mil ( i guess this difference is because they found other places to export to ), 
  haha recently a project here was delayed because they did n't build those passes for bears, 
  +1 for silva black beer, 
  then lets have 2 questions , one hard and one like this . 
  national symbols, 
   people from iasi have a weird accent , almost like that in the republic of moldova . 
  northeastern romania ( where iasi is ) is actually western moldova . 
  the oil bit is quite interesting . 
  i 've heard those oil fields were indeed very important . 
  07:49 `` if russia had taken romanian petroleum wells , then germany would have been lost '', 
  yeah having lots of small firms helped a lot, 
   i believe their forests have the biggest population of wild bears in europe . 
  wolves too  papansi papanasi *, 
  that 's because there is a lot of slavic influence in it, 
  doina songs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doina https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4um67d3a94 the wolf the oak the white pelican the lynx mititei http://fulgidevant.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mici-gratar-ghimpele.jpg bucium horn http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucium oina game somewhat similar to baseball and more than 6 centuries old http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oina miorita ballad especially the fatalism in it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miori%c8%9ba clop hats http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1006/613669147_e887b62e50_m.jpg the calusari dance http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv0mdcfx8-s#t=13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c4%83lu%c5%9fari, 
  `` an island of latinity in a slavic sea '', 
  afaik geographically the dobrogea part is balkanic and part of the culture definitely is, 
  rip, 
   italy ( $ 36 bn ) , france ( $ 32bn ) , germany ( $ 26.9 bn ) and the uk ( $ 19bn ) contributed over half of the total vat gap in quantitative terms , mainly because these are the largest eu economies . 
  in terms of ratio to their own gdp , romania ( $ 10bn ) , greece ( $ 9.7 bn ) , lithuania ( $ 4.4 bn ) and latvia ( $ 0.9 bn ) were the countries with the largest vat gap in 2011 --  the vat gap is related to non-compliance under national tax rules . 
  the policy gap , on the other hand , looks at the difference between the revenues that member states could get if they applied uniform taxation to all consumption , and compares it to the revenues they actually get due to the various tax expenditures in their systems ( e.g. 
  reduced rates and exemptions ) . 
  the study shows considerable dispersion in the policy gap across member states , ranging from the lowest in romania ( 14 % ) to the highest for spain and poland ( 48 % ) . 
  there 's also a nice table there but i ca n't paste it nvm here it is http://i.imgur.com/eqfcyv7.png, 
  anybody else having problems loading the site ? 
  is the decision final ? 
  it 's some kind of probation, 
  bring miniguns , flamethrowers and 50cals . 
  yeah there 's some communist rhetoric going on here from time to time lately from the socialdemocrats, 
  soros ( his foundation openly states they are together with , not behind , the protesters ) or some unnamed political parties, 
  longer version of the video https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151821098054280 context : in the last days there were severe floods in vaslui county and state forces came to help while some of the locals just stoood there making fun of them or going straight to the local tavern in the video , the woman ( possibly a reporter ) is . . scolding ( ? ), 
  the men who are making fun of the firemen winter 2012 http://media.realitatea.ro/multimedia/image/201202/w728/carciuma_1_16502900.jpg http://www.tolo.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/poza-tolo-1024x341.jpg, 
   the problem is the political class is probably still sitting comfortably or maybe that 's what they want you to think  ) i 'm sure they do n't like this, 
  it 's just `` common practice '', 
  we too leave them to dry on something right next to the sink, 
  significant parts of the local media are trying to portray these people as being paid to protest in order to discredit this ( imo authentic / more than most at least ) movement, 
  by romanian standards the number of protesters is already huge people here are generally apathic when it comes to politics/social issues so it 's rare to see many people protesting even if they are organised by syndicates and/or politicians, 
  it 's surprisingly peaceful so far but there are rumours of agitators being infiltrated iirc the gendarmerie said the protest is illegal ( here you have to announce the authorities giving them all the details and afaik even require their approval ) but so far they are n't doing anything about it . . 
  i guess nobody registered it because there 's apparently no leader of the protesters . 
  which kind ? 
  there already is one, 
  can u link some of those spots ? 
  yeah , all thanks to russia , good job !, 
  we could n't have done a better job ourselves . . but we 're not there yet . 
  yeah , moldavian wines in the last years have won prizes at wine festivals in bordeaux and prague . 
  in response , the external affairs minister of romania is urging europeans to buy moldavian wine http://translate.google.ro/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/stiri/titus%2bcorlatean%2bsi%2bomologul%2bpolonez%2bcer%2bromanilor%2bsi%2beuropenilor a response from of the wine makers https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1235366_727412913942196_1476936724_n.jpg another response from a wine maker https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/p480x480/1237752_616172795089534_1910402642_n.jpg, 
   a very important thing is that after signing this agreement further integration into the russian zone would be impossible . 
  why , how does this work ? 
  thank you russia for pushing moldova more towards the eu . 
  canadian company has been interested in mining here since 1998 ( they had lots of delays and beaurocracy to deal with ) their own firm estimates there are 300 tonnes of gold and ~ 1500 tonnes of silver ( worth around 27 billion dollars ) . . to give you an idea how much that means for romania , the state budget for 2013 is around 22 billion euros . 
  the state would get only around 4 billions a lot of cyanide use government is very shady about it and it 's unlikely that some officials have n't been bribed there 's a geologist that worked at that mine for some 20 years saying there are also very rare metals there that are worth a few times more than gold and it 's of significant quantity mass media coverage of the protests is little ( especially until yesterday ) and their stance is proexploitation . 
  most of the main tv channels air the company 's propaganda spots ( they brag about the 800 jobs they will create and how it will rain milk and honey ) even the national station . 
  to make it worse it seems that local officials in that area have banned investments in any other area than mining so if this fails it 's really desperate for them as they very much need those jobs . 
  well the project seems to have failed but apparently this corporation will complain to some court in washington and there seems to be some clause in the contract signed by the government a few years ago ( this whole process is ~ 15 years old ) that does n't allow the project to fail . 
  or for some compensation of ~ 2 billion usd . 
  ponta is the president there and nastase is very close to him . 
  not back in the party though , not yet anyway but the party is very eager to have him back officially . 
  i think he is banned from having any public functions like this for a while . 
  some many many years ago there were lions in europe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_lions_in_europe, 
  hmm currency in romania is also called lion ( leu ) linked with the old dutch l\u00f6wenthaler http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/loewentaler.jpg/200px-loewentaler.jpg  why is your fascination with lions ? 
  maybe they miss the time when they were roaming around there, 
   a person bribed people to vote for certain candidate by offering them vodka . 
  this reminds me a year or so ago , in moldova there were people having a prounionist meeting so one of the local communist politicians paid some morons beer for having an antiunionist meeting ( or w/e it was ) and beating up some of the prounionist ones . 
  iirc in some village in romania some time ago , there were some guys near the voting booths checking who people were voting so they would get their bucket of oil , flour , fish , etc. 
   , so the kids get left in the village with their grandparents ( or no one ) and see their parents once a year . 
  in china , this is a bit of a social problem - the `` left behind children '' often develop emotional problems as a result of not really having parents and occasionally you read horrific news articles about shit that happens to them because they 're unsupervised . 
  kinda the same here too, 
  elderly people of exsoviet countries tend to miss the old system, 
  russian empire part 3, 
  550 farsi :( should have a european language only mode, 
  ah 3 years ago a senator here was caught watching porn in the senate http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qmqfkvybbw he was bored by the debate on the pension bill, 
  guess why it took 23 years for something like this just to start . 
  you mean this ? 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_nhrmgv0ye :d, 
  taking into account the time when it was created it and especially the history up to that point ( ie gangbangs by 3 empires ) it 's really not that bad but it 's not suited for today . 
  less democratic countries tend to have this kind of anthems . 
  i do n't even know all european anthems . 
  is there a youtube list or something ? 
  mine sucks mostly because of the lyrics . 
  they are bit cringey ( i guess most are though ) with no real place in today 's context ( some parts at least questionable ) even if some of it is still relevant nobody pays attention and i want something cheerful anyway . 
  it just does n't suit more happy occasions . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztwgwehiwm0 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de%c8%99teapt%c4%83-te,_rom%c3%a2ne !, 
  out of the ones i know , i 'd pick italy 's and worldwide , brazil 's .
