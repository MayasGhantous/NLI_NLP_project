  it 's hard to pick though because i very much like the ones of turkey , france , uruguay and germany too . 
  romania : bucharest rds http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/2939270740 93/94 9eur btw there is no limit on how much ( not fast ) you can down/up did my romeii preload earlier from steam with 11 maximum and 7ish average but i do n't have pics .

  lol then considering we speak romance tongue ca n't we also be western by that logic ? 
  * cough *, 
  poland is western ? 
   as well as celebrating their birthdays , greeks also celebrate their `` names day '' which is the day of the patron saint that shares their name do westerners have this too ? 
  in the zorba movie zorba calls his lover bubulina so i had to do a bit of research . 
  the name was familiar to me before though . 
  why are you surprised ? 
  a female hero of their independence war against the turks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laskarina_bouboulina, 
  besides the stuff thats always in the news everywhere zorba the greek bubulina philosophy ( stoicism is my favorite ) , olympics , greek mythology , great culture in general problems with turks and macedonians lots of islands and mountains lots of monasteries shares some recipees with us like musaca, 
   all the press was bought out by the company . 
  i remember a few years ago a tv channel antena 3 was criticizing this corporation in some show and when commercial break started they were showing the corporation 's propaganda ads  ), 
   completely different and incompatible with western . 
  incompatible with every other culture, 
  you ca n't really give a country to nomads, 
  i do n't have a problem with it and if someone is hurt then it 's his own fault . 
  and it does n't show how it 's killed ( knife stab in the neck iirc ), 
  well just throwing money at them definitely does not work so my guess is you have to at least force them to send the kids to school and maybe in a couple of decades it will be better and they should get no social benefits otherwise and there 's also a short term effect as immediately there will be less thieves and beggars because some of the kids are sent for that . . but politicians in countries where this would be most needed ( ie the ones with lots of gipsies like mine ) wo n't do that because they willl lose their votes ( officially they are 600 000 but it 's actually more like 2 mil / total ~ 20 mil ) and gipsy leaders do n't seem to care much, 
  their energy minister said a few days ago that he is looking to import gas from romania and slovacia but i do n't know if it will be enough . 
  kapitalism our secret recipee http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1650416/ trailer http://vimeo.com/10892599 wild carpathia http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgprfblld04 there 's also part 2 but i ca n't find it online, 
  what about far left ? 
  why ? 
  you should be the first soldier to step into syria then, 
  trivia : it 's kinda the same area the ancient romans exploited after the dacian wars http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trajan%27s_dacian_wars#conclusion_and_aftermath http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ro%c8%99ia_montan%c4%83, 
  i doubt it too . 
  yes , they make engines for them here . 
   i 'm with you , neither country can handle the unification this is why it wo n't be done without a lot of foreign aid, 
  simple both countries had big internal worries already ( financial , protests see mineriads in romania ) and there is also the geopolitical factor ( i guess the west did n't care enough though moldova can be of great strategic importance ), 
  i know that generalizing is stupid and i think that `` despise '' might be too strong but : russia . 
  not the average ivan but the kremlin . 
  funny is n't there something in the bible against this ? 
  leviticus 25:35 -38 35 `` if your brother becomes poor and can not maintain himself with you , you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner , and he shall live with you . 
  36 take no interest from him or profit , but fear your god , that your brother may live beside you . 
  37 you shall not lend him your money at interest , nor give him your food for profit . 
  38 i am the lord your god , who brought you out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan , and to be your god . 
  it 's likely for the price to go up now and thus making it more interesting for dealers , right ? 
  i wonder who did it / s, 
  * a selfproclaimed gipsy king ( this trend started somewhere in the 90s ) died and there 's a conflict among some gipsies deciding who should be the new king so far they plan to have 1 international king and 1 local one ( theres also a gipsy emperor  ) ) it 's quite cringeworthy pic http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/1/1688/11268139/2/fiii-cioaba-ovidiu-dumitru-matiu.jpg?width=400 * there 's conflict between the president and the pm on removing some kind of award ( given by the president a few years ago ) to a guy called laszlo tokes ( romanian euro mp ) who 's a very controversial irredentist ( a few weeks ago tokes asked orban at a local szekler extremists meeting here for hungary to make transylvania their protectorate ) * some talk about this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_michael%27s_coup * liberals have to name a new transports minister ( last one had to go because of some justice problems ), 
  care e ultima ? 
  they have to be forced to integrate ie cut all social spending on them ( like allemoney ( ? ), 
  for kids or welfare ) unless they send the kids to school but the government is reluctant to do this because it means less votes from them . 
  we should just build more churches , who needs science anyway !, 
  they want india to recognise that their place of origin is there, 
  ah yes [ the jews did it !!, 
  ] ( http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the-jews-did-this-gif.gif ), 
  we 'd be nr 1 in `` succes in life is determined by forces outside our control '' considering how fatalistic people here are there 's even an old ballad about this that 's taught in school, 
   gypsies ( they do n't have a country , but there is a romani flag , they could use that ) afaik they are trying to get india to recognise them, 
  is that scotland in hungary ? 
  it 's a fairly even mix of `` moldavian '' written in cyrilic , russian and ukrainian . 
  bullshit look at how backwards `` romania '' ( just take all those separate regions ) when ottomans ( and the other bastards ) had control over here and compare it to the 30s or even 40s . 
  i mean compare early 19th century ( though you can go much , much further back than this as it 's pretty much the same ) with middle 20th . 
  i 'm not so sure  ), 
  lol they think they speak `` moldavian '' which is supposedly a language for them iirc the president made a joke when he went there asking for a translator  ), 
  judging by how much and how fast we caught up with the westin less than a century before communism came , i have some doubts about that . 
  only the emperor bit, 
  nope, 
  well this guy is very rich and influencial ( ie the president is very , very close to him ) so ... it 's possible that he does n't give a damn how others see him, 
  here we have a selfproclaimed king of gipsies http://mariusghilezan.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cioaba.jpg there 's also an emperor lol http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2010/02/04/50a8af9c7c42d5a66372423b/646x404.jpg the one in blue pants, 
  it 's very unlikely for belarus to join . 
  for romania , the good part is that if you can get a connection , it 's likely to be very cheap , stable and fast . 
  they teach chess as part of school program henrikh mkhitarian the genocide small country east of the black sea serj tankian :d system of a down one of our ministers here is armenian :d, 
  they got their own eu, 
   seems like we 're on track for some pretty good economic growth the next few years . 
  i would n't hold my breath . 
  unemployment rate and taxes are increasing , investments and buying power dropping with no progress in infrastructure development , these actually show the reality . 
  that harvest means little because the already troubled farmers have to sell it cheap and only the big players have storage room . 
  projections can change easily , they might just be placeholders . 
  what that group says means nothing with our typical instability problems . 
  the budget deficit is actually increasing . 
  ro magyar extremists lead by jobbik are trying to provoke conflict , again , during a summer camp here and there are responses from our foreign ministry towards hungary . 
  some mps went to taiwan using official passports and created a bit of tension with china . 
  our government is not supportive of this but 2 or 3 of those mps are in power . 
  possibly just morons . 
  heat heat heat oh and finally authorities decided to at least investigate one of the devils ( it 's interesting that the case has been passed around by 3 institutions these days with the - seems to be a very touchy subject ) that were in charge of one of the romanian gulags ( some of the elites - generals , ministers and other political figures - opposed to communism were tortured to death there but also plenty of ordinary people ) . 
  they never bothered to investigate any torturer because that could lead to interesting connections to communist party members , i suspect . 
  35 tortures are being investigated but by some institute instead of prosecutors . 
  a video of the bastard swearing and trying to hit jurnalists http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnb5soodri he 's 88 years old - might be accused of genocide, 
  geopolitics and we have lots of resources they want to exploit ( recent example chevron is very interested in the huge amount of shale gas we have here - ranked 3rd in europe ) romania 's lands are rich ( ie rosia montana area is ranked 13th in the world for gold resources , this is where the gold that saved the roman empire during trajan came from ) and it 's easy to see what the main interests of big countries like that are . 
  they even influence domestic affairs ( like they did last summer when there was an impeachment referendum ) to maintain `` stability '' towards their interests , using ambassador gittenstein ( he was heavily against the referendum http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_presidential_impeachment_referendum,_2012 ) . 
  the president here is very supportive of them . 
  `` twenty years later , romania is a thriving democracy , an economic success , and a member of nato and the european union . 
  what 's the story behind the romanian miracle ? '', 
  that guy wrote this ? 
   it seems like the former communist countries are the only ones poised to emerge from this crisis relatively unschated . 
  hahahah lol, 
  you waiting for rii too ? 
  it 's more like close to 19 payments for exports ( oil , equipment ) back during ww2, 
  i think they 'd be glad to get those billions of euros as they would find ways to syphon at least some of it and i doubt they care about paying back debts themselves . 
  their problem here is upseting germany . 
  last link gives some details on the contract it was signed in march 1939 for various merchandises and it does n't say what exactly but i 'd be surprised if it was n't oil afaik we did provide oil ( main provider . . around 13 million barrels in '41 alone ) and equipment to support the eastern front war, 
  this guy discovered this some years ago while studying economics in switzerland and a few days ago he got fired from the university he works at . 
  the university ( local one here ) council said he can not hold courses ( they are also disturbed by some articles he wrote on this theme ) anymore because it is detrimental ( or something like that - `` brings touch '' ) towards germany . 
  he also says that the counsul of germany influenced the university to do this and he filed a complaint to the national council for combating discrimination . 
  this is a debt owed since 1944 of 1.126 billion reichsmark and it would be worth up to 99 billion euros today . 
  i do n't trust this figure . 
  older news http://www.nasul.tv/2013/05/03/radu-golban-germania-are-o-datorie-istorica-catre-banca-nationala-a-romaniei-de-peste-18-miliarde-de-euro-isarescu-nu-ar-trebui-sa-minta/ shows that the initial sum romania 's national bank could receive is around 18.8 billion euros as calculated by some experts ( bergier commission ) in switzerland . 
  you need some for museums,
