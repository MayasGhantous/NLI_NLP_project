  but the right to abdicate is very useful do n't you think a new king can be helped a lot by the ex-king 's knowledge ? 
  i think it can help in adapting . 
  republic here does n't work well ( never did ) so i rather have a monarch . 
  more and more people here lean towards the idea of returning to monarchy . 
  pretty much all the balkans should get a lot of credit for that you westerners were busy with your empires and colonialism, 
  he attacked stephan the great and imprisoned vlad the impaler . 
  what did you expect ? 
  it 's not that bad , you can share blame for stalin with georgia :d, 
  bias hint  but my best friend is hungarian, 
  one that first comes to my mind is that the neocommies that took power ( which they never really lost anyway ) after 1989 declined king michael 's return . 
  came again in '92 and was banned for 5 years . 
  they had/still have a lot of fear of him partly due to his huge popularity . 
  among political figures he still is first in terms of popularity , recent poll http://www.exclusivnews.ro/stiri/stiri-nationale/regele-mihai-366-popularitate.html wiki copypasta : on december 25 , 1990 , michael i , accompanied by several members of the royal family , landed at otopeni airport and entered the country using a danish diplomatic passport , obtaining a 24-hour visa . 
  he intended to reach curtea de arge\u0219 cathedral , pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service . 
  however , on their way to curtea de arge\u0219 , the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter , taken to the airport and forced to leave the country . 
  [ 70 ] in 1992 , three years after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship , the romanian government allowed michael to return to his country for easter celebrations , where he drew large crowds . 
  in bucharest over a million people turned out to see him . 
  [ 71 ] michael 's popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu , so michael was forbidden to visit romania again for five years . 
  then it 's our involvement with allowing nato to use our airspace to bomb serbs which really disappoints me because i really like our serbian neighbours and there was a lot of `` collateral damage '' as they say . 
  it 's a zionist conspiracy, 
  i meant it worked fully a couple of times and i 'm sure that eventually there will be unification ( maybe 3rd time it lasts longer than a couple of decades like it did last time . . ) part of moldavia we already have http://exploreaza-romania.com/uploads/posts/1321118759_zona-moldovei-harta.jpg the part missing is the eastern half of the prut river http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/prut_river.jpg, 
  :d we had similar problems of our own with ( austro ) hungary and the russians sometimes a foursome with the turks still managed to unite the lands despite all that pressure : , 
  its a pc game made in poland http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_witcher#games, 
  got gangbanged by germans and russians in ww2 3 great players at dortmund pope john paul ii was polish mostly catholic great absorbtion of eu funds witcher chopin mariusz pudzianowski ( had to google the correct name ) developing well plane crash 3 years ago with lots of high ranking officials onboard lech walesa once had a very big territory back in the middle ages ( commonwealth with lithuania ), 
  good, 
  we have something similar but with neighbour 's goat, 
  i 've heard of that too here but it is never applied, 
   hence why on the maps the balkans are called `` old europe '' . 
  i 've heard that the word europe was initially used for the area south from the danube towards the greeks ( bulgaria macedonia and eastern iugoslavia area ) there was a map on r/mapporn somewhere . . 
  not much dilution i mean so far the plan is to put their szekler counties ( 2 or 3 ? ), 
  with just 1 normal county in one region, 
  there is some news coverage but i ca n't find any numbers found something , this one 6 days ago says 21 prostesters http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/regional/digi24+brasov/stiri/proteste+impotirva+regionalizarii my estimation is a hundred maximum what 's going on : politicians want to make some reform to give more powers to lower levels but without federalization which means we keep national state so no autonomy to regions mainly composed of these szeklers or any other minority ( nr 1 article in the constituion does not allow this and nobody except hungarian parties wants to change it / a procedure to change the constitution is going on and they want to influence this ) 99.9 % sure it wo n't be allowed and the constitution might not even change soon anyway, 
  you guys send prosecutors to take positions in the constitutional court as judges ? 
  yeah , from time to time there 's something about gipsies in northern countries . 
  what do you mean by `` totally unified europe culturally '' ? 
  what 's the benefit to letting countries like this in for western european countries ? 
  easier access to the resources of all kinds in those countries geopolitical game with russia . . 
  i mean either they join the eu or they eventually go for `` the other eu '' ( eurasian union which is still in the works ) and i do n't think western europe ( the us too ) would like a strong , more influential russia at their doorstep . 
  hey some gipses are mixed race so they are hard to recognise as gipsy . 
  van der vaart is a gipsy ? 
  ah , that 's why i thought it looks familiar . 
  politicians , judges and prosecutors are all very shady so i 'm not impressed by this . 
  this guy is definitely shady but the `` system '' is barely disturbed . 
  it 's more for show than anything else . 
  sentence is n't final anyway and i would n't be surprised if he is cleared . 
  sometimes judges clear someone but in the next term another judges give punishment or viceversa , this shows to me they are crooked . 
  every month or so a judge gets caught geting bribes . 
  last one i know about was in june . 
  transports minister relu fenechiu got sentenced to jail for 5 years yesterday http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-court-orders-jail-time-for-acting-minister-relu-fenechiu-pm-takes-interim-helm-of-transport-ministry/103739/ french pm visits, 
  some of them are still in charge we do n't have a lustration law, 
  iirc in our history manual , the section about our kings is 1-2 pages short . 
  and there 's a civics manual that says we 're still applying for eu membership, 
  should have includeded moldova , they are first in alcohol consumption . 
  18l/y http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/study-reveals-moldovans-to-be-the-worlds-biggest-drinkers-2218384.html or 21l/y according to another study http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249055812.html, 
  never heard of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . 
  http://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/romania/transylvanian-alps-hiking http://www.lonelyplanet.com/romania and ask on r/romania, 
  i doubt most of them would even dare . 
  112 here, 
  i 've read that albanians have dacian origins ( or at least that 's one of the main theories ) . 
  mother theresa born there mostly muslim population tensions with neighbours small country sharing similar recent ( last centuries at least ) history to the rest of the balkans cool flag skanderbeg bad ass what do albanians get thought in schools about their origins ? 
  the main reason is that it is not clear enough and things like this must be changed asap because politicians ( like basescu ) do n't have good will in interpreting when it comes to this . 
  + whoever is in power often likes to revise the constitution to make it suit the next presidential candidate ( they like modify powers of other structures too ) . 
  psd ( social dems ) were in power in 2003 when they modified it to suit their candidate geoana which lost ( possibly by fraud ) to basescu . 
  they wanted a strong geoana . 
  btw , it 's not exactly new . 
  they are just modifying the actual version . 
  i suspect it could be changed into a completely new one in a couple of decades if the pro-monarchist opinions keep developing ( somewhere around 20-25 % now in polls ) because the one we have now does not allow any other form of government than republic . 
  this is normal here one of the reason is that we have lots and lots of small internet firms so there is much competition but this phenomenon is declining fast . 
  there 's no special government support . 
  problem is rds&rcs is close to gaining a monopoly which worries me a lot . 
  cheap , fast and stable internet with no transfer limit ( i think we 're ranked 2nd in the world after s. korea ) corruption, 
  it 's tough competition in the balkans, 
   romania : cezar the roman general ? 
  still is portuguese name though :d, 
   romania : kaspersky that 's russian try bitdefender  ), 
  romania ? 
   huge political mistake like he has n't made any before, 
  in the romanian highly religious realm i 'm sure he 'd get at least 5 % more in polls and he + some anonymous sponsorship for his parties the reason would be that because becali did a lot of charity ( or some god 's athlete shit ) he deserves pardon but i dunno if basescu has enough interest in all this though i 'd bet he 's at least considering it now . 
  maybe not bribe but i would n't be so sure he could n't negotiate something with basescu . 
  becali could gain his pardon in minimum 30 days and basescu would gain popular sympathy for this ( yes , it 's quite possible ) which he is desperate for as there is somewhere around only 20 % trust in him right now . 
  did n't he even work in africa ? 
  after the fall of moldova 's pro eu government ( and by motion started by the communists ) , i think for 2013 it should be red there . 
  lol belarus is n't red, 
  oh , it is . 
  here are 2 major political events that happened just last year http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/27/world/europe/romania-government-collapse 2nd time it fell in that time period http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_presidential_impeachment_referendum,_2012 ( and that 's the * 2nd * impeachement attempt ) there 's a lot of dislike for politicians here , much more than compared to church officials while more than 60 % of the people have trust in the church http://www.agerpres.ro/media/index.php/social/item/190978-sondaj-majoritatea-romanilor-are-incredere-in-biserica-si-doreste-predarea-religiei-in-scoli.html ( lowest point in a long time , though ), 
  http://www.dcnews.ro/2012/04/peste-75-dintre-romani-merg-la-inviere/ based on a survey done last month by some institute for the usual service , ~ 14 % go a couple of times a week, 
  government is as corrupt as the church , maybe even more . 
  wasnt sure it was sarcasm :d, 
  18300 are n't enough ? 
  i think we already have the most ( per capita ) in the eu, 
  7000 rural area priests will teach farmers how to promote agriculture and use eu funds protocol signed by head of romanian orthodox church and agriculture minister, 
  yes . 
  there 's a special circle of hell for me , right ? 
  i 'm not familiar with czech beers . 
  still applies :d, 
  inspector on european integration problems http://youtu.be/t96unnnw9tk?t=1m4s from 1:04 to 1:20 and a bit later he says `` muie '' and makes it sound like `` mue '' ( ue to mean european union ) `` muie '' means blowjob but it also is the word for this sign http://www.badpolitics.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/basescu-si-mru-dau-muie-poporului.jpg context : he 's being interviewed by some journalists or something and he makes fun of them . . he 's also drunk this happened back in 2003 and he was in the socialdemocrat party ( he 's possibly in the liberal democrats right now . . dunno ), 
  that sounds like a medical pill is it a hint for alcohol to solve your problems ? 
  living in the uk , i believe you . 
  * accidentally a word, 
  so those black persons i see more and more often ( still highly rare but i notice a difference from , say , the '90s ) are refugees .
