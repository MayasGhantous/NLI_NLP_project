  i thought they were tourists or something . 
  you probably have to wait in a line or something as the guy often has lots of girls with him he 's divorced and likes young girls very much, 
  yes , be an honest mayor . 
   anyway , doing some googling , i noticed there does seem to be a mild disagreement on the date . 
  i have a hunch that 's because the 10th is much more affiliated with monarchy and most politicians try to keep away from that . 
  but that bill was signed on the 10th by the king . 
  that 's when it actually went official . 
  is n't independence day actually on the 10th ? 
   are these investors from abroad eu investors or the chinese and the us ? 
  i 've heard that arabs are very interested . 
   but about 1/3 of the price btw is it true that rural turism is something of a luxury in western europe ? 
  i call it \u021aarigrad . 
  so it 's now around 20 % ? 
  that 's amazing we give only a little over 3 % here, 
  numbers pls, 
  more than 80 % of the cases regarding wild animals and except bats ( got lots of those too though ) here are due to the foxes and there * is * a vaccination program with eu funds started 2 years ago from state report http://www.insp.gov.ro/cnepss/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/analiza-de-situatie2.pdf \u00cen rom\u00e2nia , num\u0103rul mare de cazuri de rabie se explic\u0103 prin \u00eentreruperea vaccin\u0103rii antirabice a animalelor s\u0103lbatice , \u00een contextul contest\u0103rii licita\u0163iilor pentru vaccin . 
  which means that the high number of reported cases of rabies is because the program has been interrupted ( cant find when but probably a bit before 2011 ) because vaccine licitations ( there 's always something shady there ) were contested the facts that around half the population lives in rural areas ( ~ 45 % http://www.capital.ro/detalii-articole/stiri/eurostat-jumatate-populatie-rural-urban-163873.html ) usually im middle ages style also influences this . . and that there is a lot of contact with animals , especially wild but lots of domestic ones too ( http://www.agerpres.ro/media/index.php/social/item/186384-harghita-ursii-au-produs-o-suta-de-incidente-soldate-cu-pagube-in-2012.html 100 bear incidents last year just in harghita county where also a man was killed 2 weeks ago which happens quite often ) , are the main reasons why there are so many cases . 
  romania so . . russia . 
  bulgaria, 
  never heard of partidul alianta socialista . . :d, 
  wasps are vital too,

   that imported a german king . 
  think it was prince ( took a couple of decades to be king ), 
   i 'd prefer an article write one, 
  the referendum was declared invalid due to insufficient turnout on august 27th and traian b\u0103sescu continued in office . 
  50 % +1 votes were needed and that could have happened if the lists with people able to vote was updated with the data from a census done around a year ago ( still is n't updated even now ) . 
  the internal affairs minister back then , rus ( psd ) , was n't interested in doing this ( short story , he 's closely linked with basescu 's side - pdl and some satellite parties ) . 
  van rompuy got a medal a few days ago from basescu and on psd 's external affairs minister corlateanu recommendation which makes it even worse . 
  did n't watch the video there but i suppose it explained what the epp bastards had to do with all this, 
  alde but i could change my mind . 
  definitely not epp, 
  a glitch in the matrix, 
  i have n't found an article in english yet ( it 's very new ) but you should make some sense out of it with google translate . 
  article in romanian http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/reteaualaszlo-tokes-finantata-bugetul-ungariei-1_516ed7a3053c7dd83f1b752a/index.html 3.3 mil euros from national lottery and electrical companies , external and internal affairs ministries and hungarian bank for development, 
  2013 prize list http://www.inventions-geneva.ch/pdf/2013/presse/fr-palmaresgp-2013.pdf in french, 
   i am planning to try and improve on my really poor french * sometime * . 
  which means never, 
  mi\u0163i, 
  the most common full name in my country is popescu ion ( sonofpope john ), 
  afaik it 's very healthy as long as you drink just a little . 
  they need that if they want to use public roads ( i think i 've seen a few in bucharest lol ), 
   so why was romania allowed to join the european union in the first place i think one of the reasons is bribing . . iirc we sold petrom ( gas and oil company ) to omv ( austrian group ) back when austria didnt want us to join and after the sell they suddenly changed their minds and i think the same happened with germany after we gave some contracts to some german companies worth a few billion for something regarding the borders . . no link but it was talked about back then and we are an attractive country from some povs ( lots of natural resources that surely looked tempting for the eu back then and likely still do ) and then its geopolitics . 
   romania 's educational system is really good . 
  here 's one reason you 're wrong in 2012 and 2011 only ~ 45 % ( i think it 's just for 1st session so it could go to ~ 60 % ) of pupils passed the bacalaureat . 
  for 2010 , 30 % failed it ( final result ) http://www.gandul.info/stiri/rezultate-bac-2010-rata-de-promovabilitate-a-fost-de-aproape-70-8409850 and you reminded me of this http://www.cotidianul.ro/in-romania-sunt-18300-de-biserici-si-doar-425-de-spitale-121172/ we have 18300 churches , 425 hospitals and ~ 400 schools ( 1st to 8th year ) oh and we are currently working on a 200mil people 's salvation cathedral some fields look good though ( medical ) but the most are not really good . 
   more and more people drive foreign cars ( expensive ones like mercedes or bmw due to huge corruption the market for luxury cars ( lamborghini , ferrari , porsche ) keeps increasing since 1989 ( guess happens with , ie , the money from suspicious privatisations and infrastructure spending - we sometimes spend even 20mil euros/km for roads that are done only on paper - ) just for last summer there were bought 7 ferraris ( 9 if u count may ) , 4 bentleys , 1 lamborghini and 2 rolls royces http://www.rtv.net/paradox-romanesc-saraci-dar-cu-ferrari-ce-masini-de-lux-isi-cumpara-romanii_42939.html http://www.ziare.com/auto/masini/ce-masini-conduc-romanii-bugatti-ferrari-si-lamborghini-nu-lipsesc-din-lista-1216132 we have in circulation 65 aston martin , 227 bentley , 2 bugatti , 152 ferrari , 42 lamborghini , 187 maserati , 20 maybach , 2.763 porsche and 87 rolls-royce while we or bulgaria are the poorest country in the eu here 's something funny :d http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spilfcnhdi8 becali ( owner of fc steaua . . now millionaire and when younger a shepherd ) fixing his maybach with a crowbar here http://i.imgur.com/vdtbwgr.jpg this is the reality ( btw ~ half the population lives in rural areas in middle ages style ) oh and the roads there are an exception , they are like this usually http://www.scandaldegorj.ro/userfiles/bumbesti-jiu-drum-1.jpg or worse  why would you leave your family and friends behind if you have a decent job and salary ? 
  http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-03122012-ap/en/3-03122012-ap-en.pdf ~ 40 % of the population is at risk of poverty and social exclusion  many american companies ( like hp or oracle ) decided to open their european headquarters in bucharest . 
  yes , we are good in it . 
  i 'll give you that . 
  it 's all magnificent here . . compared to most countries in africa , asia or south america . 
  we do have big potential though especially in agriculture , turism and energy . 
  what do you think now ? 
  hmm . . interesting . 
  if anyone is interested http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289848/, 
  http://www.speedtest.net/result/2593852411.png 9 euros / month no limits on how much u can dl/ul, 
  not necesarily by big parties, 
   you object any idea other than globalism , does n't globalism go hand in hand with communism ? 
  i dunno , there 's stiff competition for that title . 
  i do n't have any problems with hungarians in general , just with the parties . 
  this happened lots of times with udmr ( magyar ethnic party ) here . 
  they probably have something here but i suppose they just export the products because i did n't stumble upon anything from them in stores in bucharest . 
  or they just sell in other areas close to their factories . 
  there were rumours last year that they will buy some big stores here ( real hypermarket . . a local thing ) but nothing happened . 
  i 've never seen any bags of tesco chips here . 
  it 's nice to see we have very similar traditions around here . 
  and gypsies rather be called gypsies . . 
  and is this the best ( or lesser evil :d ) option now ? 
  who do you think will win ? 
  the grass is greener on the other side . . ? 
  well somebody must be the scapegoat, 
  is there a sub for monarchy ? 
  the republic is the real experiement, 
  russian empire part 3, 
  yes , the requirements are tight and there are still important fraud cases ( 6 million euros recent embezzlement case ) . 
  but they are n't absorbed well enough ie romania only absorbed 11 % last year ( due to the usual corruption , bureaucracy and poor information ), 
  federalisation will happen , then it will turn into some kind of dictatorship and after that it will break apart through ( civil ? ), 
  war . 
  last 2 ideas wo n't happen in the short term . 
  my reason is that the eu is/will be pretty much an empire and empires always crumble . 
  nationalism will kick in hard . 
  or , if it goes well ( rich countries will be more careful with the poorer ones ) , we will have the eu model applied in other areas and then have a world federation ... and fail after that  ) i 'm betting on the fracture . 
  lulz cheese and other perfumes, 
  shawarma , doner , gyros are not exactly the same thing, 
  i think you can bypass restrictions there not sure, 
  the whole year was about politics, 
  someone 's jelly, 
  ye those things are very much related, 
  great writing i 'll add small details . 
  in the age of enlightenment , the romanian countries were too busy sticking together . 
  and a bit later , we were among the last in europe to form a sovereign state ( 1877 ) . 
  they can still be smuggled in there, 
  romania still has a few thousands .
