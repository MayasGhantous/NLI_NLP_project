  there 's actually a pretty big problem with them . 
  there are too many bears ( ~ 5000 or so ) . 
  i 'm serious . . we should try to send some to other europeans but authorities rather have them hunted than help populate other areas . 
  http://www.transylvanianwildlifeproject.com/p/brown-bear.html we also have the most wolves in europe ( a few thousands ) . 
  is this a poustnik ? 
  russia can border with them if it wants to :p, 
  we must know our enemy jk if it is n't obivous why , it 's because our histories intersected quite often . 
  the soft spot is because we we 're their vassal for almost half a millenium obviously we 've grown accustomed to some elements * beep * imperialists, 
  you scored 37/45 = 82 % . 
  this beats or equals 72.3 % of test takers . 
  the average score is 28 . didnt have problems with balkans but some small countries around austria and italy + latvia and lithuania and w/e it was above uk ( norway ? ), 
  messed my score up, 
  ye that difference is mostly political, 
  ye , i think it 's not very healthy to not have a better relationship with the russians . 
  we still affected them indirectly constantinescu let nato use our airspace to send bombers in . 
  remember 1999 ? 
  i got no idea what serbs think of that today ( or in 1999 ) . 
  with turks i think it 's more the other way around because of hagi . 
  +1 for any thracian bro germans ( prussians more exactly ) are cool too because of the hohelzollern house . 
  i also like georgians and armenians . 
  * boos illegitimate republic *, 
  lol heard of that about moldavian women, 
  pro tip to not mix up slovakia : think of czekoslovakia !, 
  ( between germany and hungary ), 
  looks bad, 
   ... and just keep burying their dead children . 
  `` death is horrible , is n't it ? '', 
  putin asked viewers at the end of his television appearance . 
  `` but no , it appears it may be beautiful if it serves the people : death for one 's friends , one 's people or for the homeland , to use the modern word . '', 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825163/ it 's on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfbbf3oxf-e, 
  kinda related lukoil probably has some influence over our pm since he was very critical against prosecutors who were investigating it for 200m euros tax fraud . 
  people very close to him have some suspicious business with lukoil and the pm has 3 luxury apartments gifted by lukoil or middlemen, 
  can u put it on pastebin ? 
   bulgaria has purchased 1 billion cubic meters to be sent through the soon to be built greece  bulgaria pipeline and italy has purchased 8 billion any clue what % that would cover ? 
   they seem to insist if you trouble makers in the eastern eu stop provoking russia everything will be fine . 
  yeah we should stop invading russia and stop looking after our own economic interests as if we have independence from russia we are so naughty :(, 
  he was just trolling, 
  :d you 're pretty well informed on this phenomenon, 
  whats sjw ? 
   in germany it 's hard to say . 
  do n't you have them on comments sections of news websites like spiegel ? 
   so , have you met this phenomenon in your countries ? 
  in the last year or so i 've noticed a lot more antiwestern comments on news sites ' articles on russia . 
  this seems to happen at the same time when the kremlin media wants to expand here . 
  support for russia in polls is very low and high for the west so there is something weird . 
   thus they are anxious to drop the eu application with the risk of a sizeable portion of voters defecting for a party that would actually campaign as the `` eu party '' . 
  interesting point i have noticed they have n't dropped the eu thing but i did n't figure out why exactly, 
   getting in to eu would push us to the right western direction . 
  it does n't guarantee that politicians can still go hurr durr muh sovereingty and then do stupid shit look at orban, 
  juncker is, 
   yesterday i saw on some russian news that it was cancelled maybe it lied so fewer people would attend, 
  how is this ( if . . ) shown in the local media ? 
  any more pictures ? 
  who counted 50k ? 
  so could they form a government ? 
   the center party is vying in polls for the top spot but will struggle to form a coalition should it win the most votes . 
  so no, 
   it missed the shared experiences that bind europeans together , from the cultural legacy of renaissance and enlightenment , ** to the horrors of the second world war ii which galvanized the drive for united europe . 
  ** btw how likely would it be that turkey would be against further centralisation of the eu ? 
  i think it would care much about sovereingty and be a big obstacle . 
  i do n't see it being a ` team player ' for that . 
  with erdogan in power or similar types of politicians i do n't think it would join . 
  ive never seen men wearing them, 
  yeah just 1 putinbot, 
   should we react adequately to their info war ? 
  showing this putinbot thing is real should be enough, 
  my res is disabled, 
  not sure and it 's annoying that i often cant see the upvote/downvote thing so im sometimes not sure what i clicked  ) i have stylish addon and maybe a dark reddit skin for it, 
  yeah cdprojects, 
   only now is the russian gas price lower as they needed to drop it as lithuania has access to other gas sources . 
  which could actually happen in moldova 's case there is plan for us to export to them and it helped them to recently get a cheaper deal, 
  lithuania pays russia 500 bucks / thousand cbm http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html one of the biggest prices in the eu how much does the us sell for ? 
  btw they tried to force us to recognise kosovo and we too are still major allies for the region . 
  no blackmail . 
  china benefits a lot too http://time.com/3706318/russia-us-eu-conflict-ukraine/ http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/24/the-real-winner-of-the-ukraine-crisis-could-be-china/ http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/china-favored-to-win-u-s-russia-showdown/510985.html is it now a trick of china ? 
  poland has some good ones too like cdprojekt and techland, 
   but now they can be blackmailed by us . 
  it remains to be seen if they get their gas cut for ... what ? 
  looking towards russia ? 
  there 's little risk really, 
  huh men wear it there ? 
  not here, 
  we have that too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c4%83r%c8%9bi%c8%99or, 
  yeah especially back in the 90s they loved m3 ( the model was called ` teddybear ' i think ), 
   i 'm just going to disagree because i look at the 3 - 5 year picture when everything settles down you do n't know that . 
  there is no reason to think that russia wo n't be aggresive anymore . 
  after transnistria , georgia , ukraine , why do people like you still believe in russia ? 
  because you live in the west far away from russian imperialism or because you are biased against the us so it is all a trick for americans to benefit ? 
  problems with russia may actually be worse in the future . 
  if it cared otherwise then , ie , they would have implemented the minsk agreements but they chose not to do so . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacians#religion http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/dacian_religion http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zalmoxis, 
  the alternative is to let themselves be blackmailable by putin that freedom may come with a bigger price at least until the eu can get gas from other places which may happen eventually ( from azeris , greece , cyprus , israel , etc ), 
  https://translate.google.ro/?ie=utf-8&amp;hl=ro&amp;client=tw-ob#ro/en/ursari click listen, 
  cool site we got one similar too here http://www.factual.ro/, 
  i doubt that populist blog would do something against russia, 
  good luck with the stability when eastern eu complains about this too, 
  there is no sign from the eu , nothing in those agreements that open the door for ukraine to gain membership actually the eu has been trying to bury this ambition of ukraine , moldova , georgia . 
  btw do hollande and merkel still use the ` ukraine conflict ' terms ? 
  as if it 's an inner conflict which is the kremlin idea , not a war between involving russian troops too . 
  english link http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/09/27/uk-ukraine-crisis-dutch-referendum-idukkcn0rr0u320150927  the website , which has a broadly anti-eu editorial line , said it chose the association agreement as a subject for a referendum simply because it was an eu-related topic eligible for a vote under dutch electoral law .
