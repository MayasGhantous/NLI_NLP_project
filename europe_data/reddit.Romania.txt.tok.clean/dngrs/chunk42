  wtf, 
  we did it reddit, 
  technically it is still unfinished today, 
  there was a lot of excitement in the crowd when it showed flames on the parliament building in polls there 's like 14 % trust in parliament and it pretty much always was ~ 20, 
  mm yes a new visit to budapest, 
  ive already heard this proposal from one of the german ministers a week ago, 
  you 're not wrong it 's the biggest building in the world after the pentagon, 
  do they actually have players from the north ? 
  lol, 
  something similar was said for romania a few days ago, 
  remember this ? 
  http://rbth.co.uk/sport/2013/11/14/russias_journey_from_no_invalids_to_paralympic_champions_31729.html as the 1980 moscow olympics approached , a soviet official was asked whether his country would host that year 's paralympics for the first time . 
  `` there are no invalids in the u.s.s.r. ! '' he thundered back , a phrase that went down in history . 
  xpost here / r/balkanmusic, 
  im shocked, 
  philantropica and aferim, 
  i like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xu1tkect4i other peoples in the region ( balkans ) might find those costumes familiar they like to mix folk stuff with modern music and all their songs are free http://subcarpati.com/discografie-subcarpati/ these 3 are my favorite from them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elslainsld4 / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzq0yrkmvoa / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqqvuyyhfcc /, 
  lol hello new home page, 
  and its only been like half a year since he lost presidential immunity it takes a while for him to get indictments too, 
   also , it has been all but proven with papers that ponta was a collaborator of the descendant of securitatea , the sri , in the '90s , while he was a prosecutor . 
  sie , nor sri . 
  the rumour is he worked for the foreign intel agency following some italian from the un in the late 90s yugoslavia . 
   `` he 's been chosen by millions of people so he must keep his post for them '' and the pm is elected by mps , not ` the people ', 
  and again he will say he wont resign his party , by new rules , has to suspend him from the party now btw . . which maybe it means his government still falls ? 
  on 3 older occassions he said he quits if he is investigated, 
  the pollster is probably the best we have here so i tend to trust it, 
  i call shenanigans where is the orthodox priest ? 
  cool you made your own sub i suggest you make a faq where you adddress the main issues people have with ttip and with some sources, 
  mine had 27 or 28 funny thing in classes 5-8 it was mostly girls ( like 22 ) in highschool it was the other way around, 
  bless you, 
  fair game then, 
  that church is not romanian and they speak russian, 
  there was a poll done about religion and romanians 98 % believe in divinity , 61 % in astrology , 46 % in end of the world , 64 % in judgement day , 44 % dreams telling future , 52 % demons , 46 % evil spirits , 55 % curses , 19 % witchcraft future-tellers , 81 % think their precognitive dreams came true , 38 % like to bet or gamble , 50 % dont approve of halloween 20 % think they are superstitious 40 % go weekly or monthly to church half think the church should tackle issues like unemployment and euthanasia half think the church shouldnt talk about homosexuality 62 % think an atheist shouldnt be in politics http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-18430595-sondaj-ires-76-dintre-romani-cred-exista-minuni-iar-65-cred-deochi.htm http://www.obiectiv.info/sondaj-ires-romanii-nu-vor-implicarea-biserii-in-politica-dar-un-politician-ateu-n-are-nicio-sansa_39323.html http://www.ires.com.ro/articol/302/romania-credincioasa--percep%c8%9bii-%c8%99i-comportament-religios, 
  yes it was actually quite right wing which our church tends to favour like it did before with the legionaires and antonescu, 
  fake http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34272547 delete thread, 
  so the post is misleading, 
  im all for creating new states out of syria the border issue is more important than assad, 
  yes he is killing lots of people he really shouldnt ie in march 2015 , physicians for human rights published a report documenting the killings of 610 medical workers in syria since the civil war began , stating that `` these numbers are conservative given the difficulties in reporting during a war '' . 
  139 of these killings were directly attributable to torture and executions by government forces . 
  [ 158 ] according to the report , 88 % of the recorded attacks on hospitals and 97 % of killings of medical workers were attributed to government forces https://s3.amazonaws.com/phr_reports/doctors-in-the-crosshairs.pdf http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/report-600-medical-staff-killed-syrian-war-29554097 also at least 400 children have been killed ( [ it 's 12 thousands now ] ( http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/08/more-than-330000-people-die-while-about-13000000-wounded-and-displaced-since-the-beginning-of-syrian-revolution/ ) ) in 11 months of violence in syria and almost the same number detained , with reports of torture and sexual abuse , http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/unicef-says-400-children-killed-in-syria/story-e6freonf-1226265280318 http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/02/03/146346490/rights-group-says-syrian-security-forces-detained-tortured-children, 
  assad staying in power wont solve the civil war which was going on even before isis entered the picture ( in that country / 2 or 3 years after the uprising first started ) putin is just using some people 's fear of muslims for his own interests https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war, 
  yeah and the ttip crowd would go berserk pls mods pick him !!, 
  slovenia/croatia next route, 
  if only we still had vadim to guard us !, 
  the danube is man made ? 
  for a second there i thought they made you mod, 
   that 's funny , because the stereotype of the middle east being a land of neverending strife is pure racist and ignorant bullshit . 
  europe was the land of neverending warfare until second half of 20th century , it boasted the largest death totals from wars too the middle east is going through the same shit europe went through in the late middle ages and will keep doing so until borders get redrawn to better fit the nations there ( fix the sykes-picot agreement which is the root cause there now , that and sunni vs shia oil pipes but it 's part of the same picture ) or until a new islamic empire takes over them all, 
   now neomarxists who are those ? 
  you can start blaming the french and the british for libya for syria look at saudi/turkish vs iran/syrian oil pipes interests ( any of those are good from us pov since they are still alternatives to russian oil for the eu ), 
  main thing imo is the way borders were drawn they need to be redone, 
   and libya is in its own civil war with 4 + participants the situation there is looking much better . 
  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/libya-rival-governments-reach-consensus-150913125124101.html libya 's rival governments have reached a `` consensus '' on the main elements of a political agreement , a un special envoy has told reporters . 
  bernardino leon said in skhirat , morocco , on sunday that the two sides were able to `` overcome their differences '' on major outstanding issues , increasing the likelihood of signing a long-awaited agreement to form a unity government this month . 
  leon said it was the first time `` that we have the possibility to make it and to have this agreement with all the parties , all the key parties in libya onboard , '' adding that both sides have made compromises . 
  not on this sub not anymore, 
  well the world will end, 
   you do n't have to flee from turkey . 
  not really true http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/syrian-refugees-turkey-long-road-ahead meanwhile , formal immigration channels , including recognition of refugee status , remain restricted to europeans , while non-europeans receive temporary protection status and are expected at some point to resettle in a third country . 
  they have to leave there after a while and there may not be peace in their own country til who knows when, 
  hmm very few in russia considering how big it is and that it also meddled in there btw amnesty international points out that other high-income countries like russia , japan , singapore and south korea have offered zero resettlement options . 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/08/world/gulf-states-syrian-refugee-crisis/ meanwhile gulf states arent even signatories to the un refugee convention so what to expect, 
  you overestimate israel 's influence see the iran deal ie, 
  the offer may not have been genuine and besides that you had the opposition boycotting talks https://www.rt.com/news/fsa-boycott-opposition-talks-syria-204/ / http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/12/world/meast/syria-unrest/ / http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/03/224135.html /, 
   the article is much less clear cut , suggesting that problems arose when discussion came to the details yeah russia 's offer was probably like here we give up assad but we want someone much like him in his place, 
  this is fake , right ? 
  if it isnt fake then it could be good pr continuing last year 's campaign http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putins-gay-rights-charm-offensive-ahead-of-sochi-winter-olympics-is-all-lies-activists-say-9070627.html, 
  lots of slavic influence here, 
  the jean-marie le pen of the carpathians more like a populist , not ultranationalist . 
  he did n't care one bit about romanians ie the ones in serbia where he backed the milosevic regime . 
  some stuff about him : during the elections in 2000 he said that romania should be governed with machineguns and that his party would bring chinese style public executions in stadiums . 
  in 1998 he also proposed renationalisations of factories , banning the main magyar party and martial law in 2 szekler majority counties . 
  was very critical of the justice system ( he had some law problems ie in 98 there was an attempt to lift his mp immunity but his ` socialdem ' buddies helped him block it ) , anticorruption campaign and wanted an amnesty and pardon law to pass ( so big crooks could be released ) lots of hateful messages about hungarians , jews and rroma in particular but other minorities too . 
  was associated with ex high rank communists , other populists and old secret police members some being even family members . 
  he and his allies are to blame for one of the mineriads , the one in 1999 . 
  his group played roles in the other ones too . 
  wrote much poetry praising the ceausescus and their regime was protesting violently when we condemned communism 's crimes here and is a supporter of relations with russia and putin now there are other ` vadim ' type politicians taking his place since other populists are jailed and there are lots of votes of this type to be won next year recently he was close to meaningless politically and was just a buffoon in tabloids he was the first far right candidate to make it into 2nd round of a presidential elections , in europe postww2 . 
  happened in 2000 when iliescu won . 
  the center right was in-fighting focused on split candidates instead of 1 . our transition from communism would have been much easier without him and the struggle is far from over rip but im glad he is gone, 
  some poetry by him about death was published a week ago he may have known from doctors earlier that his problems are very serious, 
  ours are quite overcrowded too since more and more politicians got into jailed there 's been a lot of complaining ( a bit too dramatising imo ) about prison conditions and a media campaign in their press, 
  you vote jobbik then ? 
  is that a r/europe meet-up ? 
  who do u buy electricity from ? 
  no bombing then . 
  that means western ground troops then which wont happen . 
  so france will bomb rebels too i suspect, 
  well the justice minister did say months ago that we need more prisons but i doubt it is this kind, 
  its good that it isnt allowed because its full of very dubious videos trolls like to use . 
  im not surprised new r/europe complains . 
  the dairy products ? 
  its swedens fault again, 
  back ? 
  they were trolling they had lotsof downvotes, 
  they were trolling there, 
  yeah iirc turkey wanted saudi pipe because it would go through their country but it had to go through syria too the iran pipe was not going that way ( straight west i think ) here is a map https://iakal.files.word broken press.com/2015/08/map-of-iran-syria-and-qatar-turkey-pipelines.jpg https://iakal.word brokenlink press.com/2015/08/21/who-is-responsible-for-the-war-and-the-immigrants/ do read it , it 's not really long . 
  for the us both pipes are good since it still means less reliance for it 's allies in europe on russia directly even if iran is friendly to russia ( iran may open up more to the west in the future now ), 
  it is for reddit armchair strategists tho, 
  nobody else has to agree with you either, 
   and nothing is done about it we are trying to raise it here,
