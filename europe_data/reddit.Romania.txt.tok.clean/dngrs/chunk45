   this comment also reads as trolling/agenda pushing . 
  explain ? 
  he 's only trying to fit in judging by how this sub looks like, 
  cuz they 'd only take in slaves, 
  surprise surprise ... 
   russia building major ~ ~ military base ~ ~ tourist center near ukrainian border, 
  31 % vs 25 % english speakers http://jakubmarian.com/map-of-the-percentage-of-people-speaking-english-in-the-eu-by-country/, 
  now if only we could download money ... 
  http://eurasiangeopolitics.com/2015/09/06/a-response-to-tim-ashs-the-big-call-on-ukraine-in-the-kyiv-post/ this response , a different view , is more interesting, 
  yep this sub is screwed without strong active mods, 
  it 's a boon for the far right and euroskeptics so yeah it 's gold for him too, 
  her methods are illiberal, 
   ttip has been widely written about objectively ? 
  bullshit http://uatoday.tv/business/romania-no-longer-relies-on-russian-gas-for-first-time-in-decades-416782.html also http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html graph 4 but 2 years old data http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europes_vulnerability_on_russian_gas we 're gon na export more to neighbours too in the future germany keeps working against this trend of reducing russian leverage, 
  muh yuropean identity !, 
  oh yes right there she saved european identity and christianity !, 
  right , orban ? 
  and then when comments like these will get deleted someone will make a new thread complaining about mods censorship, 
   why does / r/europe seem biased towards pro-migrant content ? 
  it 's the other way around, 
  bases not in the same place ? 
  map here http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55eec098bd86ef15008b88be-1944-1716/2000px-syria15.png they just bomb a certain area i guess, 
  it sometimes catches prosecutors of it 's own too, 
  tldr his focus is against non-isis rebels im guessing it 's because people from that group could replace assad and meanwhile the west is focused on isis i wonder if france will bomb the non-isis ones, 
  tourists, 
  it 's a nice diversion from what prosecutors do these days, 
  you know that how ? 
   wo n't it exacerbate romania 's already huge brain drain problem ? 
  it has nothing to do with people movement, 
  we meet criteria so our blocking is only political ( iirc opposition is from dutch and germans ), 
  a new broomgun ? 
  my eyes have been opened, 
  about 180 children survived infancy , and 97 sons and daughters were reported living as of 2000 . 
  at his death he had more than 1000 grandchildren, 
   essentially the only tv covering anti-government protests local media here is following the events there too nice victimising, 
  i think he 's trying to catch stormfront type trolls this sub has attracted a suspicious kind of posters in the last couple of weeks, 
  and the foreign policy might become more isolationist too in the future, 
   he 's a paid shill , like most other default sub moderators . 
  paid by who ? 
  the joos ? 
  lol a leftist sayin russia and iran are goodguys, 
  perfectly fine, 
  western local ones seem to have, 
  it 's becoming less and less reliant on the saudis http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-01/u-s-oil-imports-from-opec-have-plunged-to-a-28-year-low, 
   you must also think iran is against hezbollah and the houthis ... no, 
  iirc around 500 are actually accepted, 
  i thought iran is against assad, 
  putin such genius , much strategy, 
  not here far from it, 
   the americans stirred up in the middle east maybe it wouldnt have matter so much if europe in the first place was careful with how it drew lines on the middle east map you may find this interesting http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html it 's a lot more complicated than raining milk and honey in the middle east until american involvement,

  sorry greece but you lose today !, 
   are you for upholding current way of funding political parties from government budget ? 
  btw here we had a law change in may and parties that get at least 3 % will be paid back by the state to cover their election costs ( 0.2 % of total budget limit ) . . tho money spend on campaigns is a lot more than the official sums plus some other changes for transparency etc, 
  lesser evil ? 
   bulgarians should vote for small , new political parties to take power away from the main , established ones . 
  same thing needs to happen here next year . 
  it will be a big battle between lots of small parties for kingmaker role, 
  i bet you have ` muh sovereingty ' type reactions from your crooked politicians on this, 
   and once they go through the process , they can move to germany anyway since freedom of movement is one of the core tenets of the eu . 
  just for 90 days i think, 
  need his name, 
  so much ad popullum on europe recently, 
  communists voters switched to fn ? 
  what about bolsheviks btw ? 
   i 'm surely going to get downvoted for this but fuck it . 
  such a hero, 
  2nd best comment currently, 
  translation problem ? 
  btw germans built their first as tractors https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leichttraktor after the first world war , germany was restricted in military development by the treaty of versailles but a secret program under the name cover `` traktor '' was developing armoured military vehicles and artillery, 
  lets have tractor fights in the colosseum, 
  the dlc, 
  so you admit poland is eastern , not central .

  no mate those were just some kind of tourists, 
  never heard of untermensch ? 
  i think one of those 3 is much more equally biased than the others, 
  kremlin has much tolerance for him but maybe snowden already plans to move somewhere else, 
   do you happen to know if the reason for bribing was made up or something ? 
  it 's basically informal law for a contracter to give a bribe to a politician so they can win a contract this mayor was ratted out by someone who also was investigated i think so he helped prosecutors catch him take a new bribe . 
  i love how this snitching works , 
   i guess people are still used to and for some reason still want the style of the ex-president , that used to go almost daily and say whatever was on his mind , usually causing shitstorms for no practical reason . 
  this 1000 times some people complain that he does nothing because they dont see the scandals ( irl shitposts , trolling , flaming ) they were used with by the other presidents, 
  well the current president had around 75 % this spring now ~ 60, 
  lol, 
  it kinda makes sense because the old guard is close to impossible to change in mentality ( like our politicians ) you just need new and start from scratch, 
  yes one also has to keep in mind there is a big part of the media ( the majority of it ) making politicians look like victims and downplaying the justice campaign, 
  interim president wasnt voted by the party members proper , just by their bureau or w/e it 's called . 
  and the bribe money they found on him were just you know monopoly paper, 
  not cool, 
   in a country such as romania where you have weekly arrests at the highest level , perception would probably be higher , imo . 
  yes that makes sense, 
  there is no confidence vote this autumn and he may not survive again he lost some support from his party ( new interim chief - a different crook already sentenced for referendum fraud ) does n't seem to be on his side, 
  cool are we qualified ? 
  after the 2012 romanian elections the usl ( group of different parties but was registered there as a single one ) had ~ 70 % of parliament seats what followed ( in the same summer ) was something close to a coup ie the immediate dismissal of the speakers in both chambers of the romanian parliament and the country 's ombudsman and the the government changing the referendum law on the day before vote in parliament to help an impeachment pass also an emergency ordinance was passed by government restricting the attributions of the constitutional court https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_romanian_constitutional_crisis, 
  we need to rename this sub / r/immigration and move this thread to a different sub, 
  [ waiting ] ( http://www.nkayesel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/charlie-chaplin-waiting.gif ), 
  nice save :d, 
   the `` out '' campaign got 80 % of its funding from an obese chav couple who won the lottery ffs .
