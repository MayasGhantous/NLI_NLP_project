  their elite needs conflict and enemies , real or not , to keep power . 
  isnt that priest a chief of state ? 
  he talks politics too, 
  some of thr proposal makers actually have justice problems . 
  one has a sentence and btw one is a relative of the pm . 
  funny thing prosecutors say he bought 2 apartments with stolen money which btw he sold 1 week before investigation started he is the 3rd or 4th 2014 presidential candidate to be indicted, 
  yep and there is no interim party chief, 
  he did say something about russia but he 's the one trying to protect lukoil, 
   politicians did as they were asked initially the new agency was toothless but more reforms happened in the middle 2000s including wage reforms and it brought us where we are now this ex minister has much merit in this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monica_macovei#anti-corruption_reforms, 
   russian people love putin it helps that you get to that point by killing over a hundred journalists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia#a_list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia i counted over 130 with putin in power, 
   the alliance decided not to offer georgia a map due to opposition from several countries , led by germany and france , who feared the decision would anger russia . 
  no wonder the us spies on them, 
   and anonymous tips to the fiscal head offices have reached record numbers nowadays btw here the number of denouncements/notices sent to the anticorruption agency from citizens went up 63 % last year the nr of prosecutors is low for the thousands of cases they have, 
  they have a problem with their voter base otherwise they would n't be worried and they would n't have lost the presidentials and by such a big difference too, 
  that and their hubris they keep stealing and geting caught even though they see what is happening to others, 
   he has warned repeatedly on the risks of joining euro while the economy is unprepared yeah he said something like only bucharest is ready, 
  68 % yes april 2015 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_and_the_euro#public_opinion i think the politicians are too optimistic with 2019 and i really hope bruxelles will check very carefully before allowing us ( it probably will i guess ) in because i do n't trust these bastards . 
  i wonder if golden dawn or kke will gain more votes in the future, 
   it only seems like psd is targeted more because they 're the most corrupt . 
  they have by far the biggest party which means more corruption, 
   we even have old novels describing exactly this sort of decadent mentality . 
  same here caragiale 's criticism of our 19th century society is valid for today too, 
  you mean the death of that prosecutor years ago ? 
  no for those who dont know and are curious a prosecutor , lele , was investigating the son of an important politician ( big sponsor in 2000 's parliamentary election ) from the pm 's party back in 2002 . 
  senior prosecutors , under government influence , wanted to investigate him for negligence . 
  a young 29 year old prosecutor panait from the highest court was sent to investigate and he did n't do that , he stopped the investigation . 
  the thing is a week after that panait killed himself . 
  he was behaving for quite a while under much stress . 
  panait 's case was closed as a suicide and nothing more happened since . 
  lele said a few months ago that he thinks he was killed , his accusations were just for intimidation and that panait was given some kind of medicine . 
  panait 's aunt thinks ponta ( prosecutor colleague / who btw became chief of staff to the pm or something , pm nastase is his mentor ) has responsability as told to her by panait the day after the suicide attempt before going into a coma ( he jumped from 3rd story ) . 
  in 2012 this ponta said he wants ` to take political control over this agency ' . . look how that worked out :d, 
  it saved him only from some accusations , not all of them . 
  he ca n't be saved for what he did just as lawyer in the past . 
   he 's still in control of the party , it 's just a marketing move . 
  we might see snap elections this autumn btw, 
   and the government used the money saved from anti-corruption to reduce the taxes . 
  that 's not helping the poor . 
  wtf that 's the fault of prosecutors ? 
   anti-corruption is great , but it 's not helping at all to reduce poverty . 
  you realise this anticorruption wave is just a few years old ? 
  big grin i think, 
  for other accusations he is still immune http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/romania-government-idusl5n0yv0xs20150609 some of his wealth could be seized ponta said 2-3 times in the past that he will resign as pm if he is charged . 
  just another lie . 
  iirc he 's the 2nd pm to be indicted ( after his ` political idol and mentor ' ex 2 time convict adrian nastase ), 
  yeah i dont want transnistria either, 
  birthplace of democracy, 
  greece should accept, 
  well our parliament has something like 12 % in polls so . . eu, 
   you 'll find that political parties that hate the eu all somehow mysteriously love russia for some reason . 
  it 's funny how it 's both far right and far left extremists doing that, 
  more bad news, 
  i can see the members closer to the kremlin being against that . 
  i suspect hungary would be against . 
  the problem is in moldova they are split 50/50 over this and the politicians seem to have reorientated back towards russia there is the money issue too, 
  rogozin ( russian deputy pm ) just threatened that transnistria will become independent if moldova joins us, 
   it is pretty clear that countries with a hard stance are taking mostly their internal politics in account , and not the common good . 
  how do you know the other countries do n't do that because of internal politics ? 
  it kinda is by our standards very few people go to any kind of manifestations there 's much support in polls btw and at high political level, 
  the damn lizard people i bet, 
  huh ? 
  what is this then https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=ttip&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on ? 
  got some links about that ? 
  left wing ( tho they have antisemitism problems ) but sometimes it 's just stupid ( or manipulates on purpose ? ), 
  and populist, 
   could we please stop linking to shitty conspiracy rag . 
  but reddit loves this kind of sites . 
  the ep itself saved that since it rejected it , not just that pirate . 
  everything bad there is due to foreign conspiracies huh reminds of greece a bit, 
  explain zeman and his buddies, 
  anaf still has a lot of work to do . 
  ie rate of collecting damages declared to be seized by courts after corruption trials is 5-10 % which is terribly bad . 
  townhalls + county councils parliament it 's likely that the current government main party ( who 's pushing these tax reforms ) will go into opposition but these changes will still affect the liberals not only in votes but they will have to deal with filling the budget gaps . 
  future cuts and other spending increases are planned . 
  24 % until recently . 
  now 9 was 19 until 5 years ago, 
  yes we have a surplus and investment went down a lot 2 elections next year btw, 
  tax collecting went up but i dunno for sure if this wil be covered . 
  last year ( or late 2013 ) we had a new fuel excise ( besides some other new stupid taxes ) to cover a big tax cut . 
  we were supposed to use the ~ 700m euros to build much needed highways and did shit and the money went to cover the budget.the pm admitted this . 
  is grecophobe a thing yet ? 
  this normally should mean he 's doing the right thing, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h9f8d/the_most_common_first_names_in_europe_2012/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/395dk2/the_most_common_surnames_in_europe/ https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1barmf/map_of_the_most_common_surnames_in_europe_2011/, 
   so if we want to be neutral we should `` condemned '' sch\u00e4uble too . 
  for what ? 
  that joke ? 
  how is it comparable ? 
  is this econotimes.com your own site or what ? 
  wtf, 
  there was also an earlier wave of germanics in ancient times, 
  it goes back to 19th century relatinisation, 
  we 've had germans here for a long time, 
   they arrange useless referendums that i assume are not gratis to organize btw how much did it cost ? 
   these measures were hugely controversial at the time , and many people thought they would lead to catastrophe . 
  the us economist paul krugman predicted at the end of 2008 : `` latvia is the new argentina . ''  by the second half of 2010 , however , the economy had started to grow again , and from 2011 to 2013 latvia was among the fastest growing countries in the eu . 
  despite the fact that the currency was not devalued , exports are now at record highs , some 60 % above where they were before the crisis . 
  the nobel prize winner said bs !, 
  omg !, 
  it cant be true,
