  ** `` his subsequent protest that he personally has nothing against jews makes no difference . 
  he used anti-semitism for political purposes and that must be condemned , '' he added . 
  ** such statements are now part of the `` official ideology '' of so-called `` people 's republics , '' accused vyacheslav a. likhachev , an anti-semitism researcher with the euro-asian jewish congress . 
  `` what is important , i think , is that there is no condemnation from russia after the anti-semitic statements of the leaders of pro-russian regimes , '' he said . 
  oh ok then time to lift sanctions,

   in one stroke european finance ministers would have achieved what nato spent the cold war striving to avoid : a russian naval presence in the mediterranean . 
  already done with that cyprus deal ? 
   abolish the criminal offence of having a conflict of interest btw it 's not a coincidence that they are trying to legalise one of the accusations for the pm . . which parliament blocked, 
  only in wcs because team yurop !, 
  my last electricity bill shows that in 2014 we got 43 % of our production from renewables and my supplier gets 57 % of it from that kind of energy, 
   haha , look closer , it 's a belgian flag , not an romanian one . 
  it 's often confusing if one does n't pay attention . 
  sometimes i turn the tv on and watch some sports countries competition and i get all excited until i notice it 's the belgian flag instead of mine and we werent even qualified . 
  hey yellowcakewalk why was your account banned ? 
  tldr austrian government wants romanian kids in austria to get 15 euros child allowance instead of 150 and our mfa complains btw in romania they can get ~ 19 euros ( recently doubled from 9 ), 
  i bet fico does n't like this, 
   moscow threatened on june 19 to retaliate against belgian-linked foreign firms operating in russia after its official assets were frozen . 
  so the threat worked, 
  who the hell is * praising * war ? 
  wtf do you want ukraine to do ? 
  you 'd be thinking very differently btw if we werent in nato/eu and the russians would be here too, 
  malinkovic and rajkovic seem to be their best players and there are some other interesting ones too http://www.espnfc.com/u-20-world-cup/2285/blog/post/2499327/veljko-paunovic-the-man-behind-serbia-under-20-world-cup-win, 
  why are there so many conspiracy nuts on reddit ? 
  i mean this sort of activism ( or some sort of job ? ), 
  just posting lots and lots of bs links , almost no comments . 
  just some kind of karmawhoring ? 
  reddit loves this, 
  putin said they got it in honest manner so then i guess they can just stop investigating, 
   romanians living standards are increasing . 
  the greeks ' living standards are decreasing . 
  that 's not how it 's supposed to work . 
  so it should be the other way around ? 
  russian deputy pm arkady dvorkovich said `` russia could examine financial aid for greece '' . 
  safer harbors where ? 
  in russia ? 
   )  russian deputy pm arkady dvorkovich said `` russia could examine financial aid for greece '' . 
  and redditors were saying * the media * was lieing about tsipras going after russian aid https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3a9xor/greece_has_not_asked_russian_finance_ministry_for/, 
  there 's a jobbik mp wanting this kind of thing on our borders too also ukraine 's and croatia 's, 
  it looks like those sanctions are just to punish crimea for being annexed , not for russia 's doing . 
   if that happens i really hope the romanian government steps in and tells omv to fuck off the government led by a pm who tried to protect russian lukoil from prosecutors ? 
  lol :d maybe it 's the right place for someone like him, 
  btw there 's a rumour now that omv will sell petrom to gazputin, 
  nice partner gazputin has, 
  there is this tho  `` a financial deal package to greece is definitely possible , but it 's unlikely to come as a straight bailout loan , and more likely to be packaged as part of an advance payment deal over gas transfer or something similar , '' said chris weafer , a moscow-based financial analyst . 
  i do n't see the lieing, 
   and obama does n't have the keys to moneyplane 1 . 
  which media was saying he went now to ask for loan ? 
  downvotes for asking sources, 
  so stupid, 
  shor good looking ? 
  that pig with a unibrow ? 
  too bad who will now save france from the muslims , jews , easterners , gypsies , america , etc ? 
  no he is shor google ilan shor it is him in the blue suit, 
  and how would they do that ? 
  suddenly a gagauzia ? 
  they are in the middle of the country will they get green men from where ? 
  or what btw magyar politicians are very corrupt too and they also dont really care about anything else than staying in power ( very often in government ) and the hurr durr muh repressed minority is brought up just for elections . 
  there 's a good chance they wont make their 5 % needed to make it into parliament next year . 
  the constitution doesnt allow that and its very difficult to modify it even for normal stuff ( we failed a few years ago because too few came to vote ), 
   if the szekely conflict is problematic in internal politics , then i ca n't wait to see what happens when moldova joins . 
  it wont be something even half as serious as the ones in moldova, 
  yeah the last time it romania got bigger was because the west had interests so maybe now they will have interest again ie for the stabilising effect of the region, 
  i know some that do just english ( agerpres.ro is in romanian btw ) http://www.romaniajournal.ro/ http://www.agerpres.ro/english state media and looks like google translated wtf http://www.nineoclock.ro/ http://www.thediplomat.ro/index.php http://www.balkans.com/index.php romania section http://actmedia.eu/ editorials on romania-insider and the other have some bad bias so i 'd be careful with that but the ` news ' are ok and for bigger stories you can just google and find stuff on mainstream international sites like reuters, 
  mods hide this or orban gets ideas, 
  lol :d, 
  a deputy mirkoczki from jobbik said today he wants the same done on ukraine , croatia and romania borders, 
  maybe they are still waiting for instructions from the kremlin, 
  i wonder what le pen and fn say about this if anything at all, 
  no and nobody will ask them about that too, 
   for now , ilan shor - the man at the centre of the allegations - has only been charged with one offence - abuse of office while in charge of banca de economii . 
  and for the last few weeks , he 's been released from house arrest to allow him to compete in mayoral elections in his family 's home town of orhei , north of chisinau . 
  he won , this week , with 62 % of the vote , perhaps partly because of the `` presents '' i saw being given out at the end of one of his campaign meetings - plastic bags containing toothpaste , shampoo and washing powder . 
  ffs guys :\\  $ 1bn has vanished from three of moldova 's leading banks , much of it passing through uk companies . 
  what happened with the russian banks story ? 
   we do n't want them . 
  um polls say ~ 3/4 do, 
  well friedman runs stratfor , right ? 
  is n't this the guy who predicted a war between the us and japan a few decades ago ? 
  where 's the new pearl harbor ? 
  past ? 
  that is 2015-2025 give me 2005-2015 or older, 
  does anybody have any trust in stratfor predictions ? 
  you didnt even read the article  prosecutors in eastern ukraine have filed murder charges against two ukrainian soldiers, 
   the suspects , aged 23 and 25 , were later arrested and confessed to the murder . 
  if convicted , the accused could spend their life in prison . 
  it 's good that someone is investigating these idiots unrelated . . from the comments what is the source link of this http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/2171/7134/original.jpg ? 
  i want the story, 
  83 % bernie and the next 2 candidates from the same party ~ 60 % i did n't answer some questions . . about 6 or so i think, 
  wtf, 
   parliamentary committees are like this in every country . 
  the whole idea of them is that you appoint the politicians that you do n't want near any position of actual power to circlejerk in a committee for the whole day so that they do n't interfere with the business of actually running the country . 
  parliamentary committees are also a great way of energizing your voting base and scoring political points . 
  yeah we got idiots here too the senate speaker created a few days ago a commission to monitor democracy and rule of law because prosecutors and judges bring too much damage to mps and the government so it has to be under more democratic control or the stalinist anticorruption prosecutors will form the new commie secret police, 
  disaster may be a too strong word but yeah it 's why the us sides more with greece i think, 
   which is n't surprising considering how much eu economy benefits from export to russia . 
  just 6 % are to it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union#trade btw 41 % of russia 's trade is done with the eu http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26436291, 
  the biggest single upset was in the central town of orhei , which elected ilan shor as mayor with just over 60 percent of votes . 
  in may an international report named shor as a key beneficiary of a scandal that saw $ 1 billion - equivalent to one eighth of moldovan gross domestic product - disappear from three of the country 's largest banks . 
  shor , who denies the accusations , will not gain immunity from prosecution in his position as mayor .
