  they are completely incompatible with where the eu wants to head , but i suppose we 're stuck with them . 
  where eu wants to head -- where exactly ? 
  yeah you are stuck with us is hungary compatible ? 
  just a different accent it 's common in the moldovan half of romania too, 
  meh he 's liked by old people that miss the times when they were young which happen to be ceausescu times, 
  he 's liked in polls, 
  king michael or ceau\u0219escu, 
   i would ask the mods not to remove this because i believe it is relevant to europe you talking about putler ? 
  not really ie the deputy pm has another trial at the end of the month ( 2012 impeachment referendum vote fraud case ) they are n't that untouchable, 
  is the minister new ? 
  yeah they have great seafood in belarus, 
   newer eu members also have to show results in fighting corruption , some of the older ones should too, 
  charisma ? 
  i think we 're selling for normal price ` close to market level ' in moldova 's case it 's 330 $ / thousand m ^ 3 and gazprom sells for ~ 360 how much do you pay gazprom ? 
  is there a contract or something saying we ** have ** to cover others ? 
  btw we 're supposed to become net gas exporter by 2020 i think we already export some gas and electricity ( a deal with albania , we sent a bit to hungary from last december ) and there is a plan to connect pipes to serbia the eu should normally become a lot less dependant on russia but it will take some years for that to happen ( lng , something going on in greece , shale ) the next years are very important, 
  is it likely that we will see some of these names replaced ? 
  it always was a little russia of the balkans but we already have hungary and some big countries that are leaning more and more towards russia so i do n't know if it matters much anymore i think it will bring more fragmentation in the eu, 
  we have spammers like that too on news sites ' comments that 's why some of them have that section removed a couple years ago some guys from a news site looked at the ips of some of those bots and found that they were from a youth party headquarters some of our politicians admitted that these methods are used i bet it 's common in most countries, 
   gypsies treated like shit in their home countries so they leave it ( all racists ' wet dream ) is the very reason why romania is n't inside schengen yet . 
  organised crime crooks ( usually gypsies btw ) are the ones sending them to beg  stop purging an unwanted minority out of your country and borders will be open for all of you . 
  i will now stop purging the gypsies . 
  yeah but nobody anticipated these problems back then, 
  the problem is that ** now ** is a very bad time for deals like that, 
  longer article http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-senator-former-minister-get-jail-sentences-in-rompetrol-refinery-stock-manipulation/133031/ btw another mp got 3 years suspended sentence for conflict of interests . . different case an investigation started agaist an ex prefect a mayor , 2 judges and a prosecutor sent to trial the brothers of a syrian that was sentenced for terrorism a few years ago got 5-7 years all in the same day and i think i 'm missing some more news . . oh a county council president was detained . . again i think, 
  you win this time !, 
  so more money for middlemen in belarus ? 
  same for puna and lottot, 
  today the seizure has been lifted partially, 
  the pm has criticised the prosecutors for doing this, 
  not yet, 
   `` we must oppose the ` divide and rule ' games that russia is constantly playing with the eu , '' he said last week when meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin . 
  so you oppose this tactic by . . planning to give them more leverage  `` very pragmatic and common-sense approach in all of our russia policies '' . 
  it would have been pragmatic if you would have kept interest in lng, 
  woah 2 whole points ? 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/ greece favorable 61 unfav 35, 
  any recent polls on joining the eu ? 
  lots of greeks like them, 
  what do the other 70 % think ? 
  the only noble work is in the gulag, 
   european nato member states will not be able to defend the baltic countries against any conventional attack due to the dilapidated state of our armed forces and the general exposed position of the baltics . 
  they could win in the counter attack though, 
   native russian speakers should not have russian as the first language in school ? 
  poroshenko did n't say that , nor did other posters . 
  russians will still be able to learn russian . 
  they will probably have a special minority regime . . is n't that the case already there with so many russians ? 
  anyway it gets done because the eu cares about things like this too, 
  the guy is suspected of corruption and other abuses so hospital staff and some afghanistan war vets put the guy in a dumpster and dragged him around the city to the local council where he finally accepted to sign his resignation . 
  who 's side do you think russia would pick ? 
  if any i 'm guessing india 's . 
   illegal squatters . 
  so it 's there just to help ukraine negotiate better with russia, 
  you 're making things up, 
  here you get taught english starting in 2nd grade and french ( or sometimes something else ) is added starting in 5th there 's some english in kindergarten too, 
  btw how did you guys end up with u\u0161akovs as riga mayor ? 
  why ? 
  i know almost nothing about politics there . 
  i wonder if the next one will be in central asia between russia and china, 
   plot twist : putin 's antagonization forces countries to increase their ties ultimately ending in a federal superpower and it turns out putin was actually a ~ ~ brussels ~ ~ berlin lackey all long who played the boogyman to achieve this . 
  i 'm gon na be very surprised if this guy does n't end up killed . 
   that will take much more time time and money . 
  does n't russia actually sell pretty cheap because of the government support ? 
  there are already economic problems so i expect there to be little interest in all this, 
   i would n't say russia is picking up countries to make us turn against each other . 
  it kinda is russia threatens the baltics and then the baltics criticise the other countries for their deals with them ( like france and those ships ), 
  they do n't recognise they are theirs anyway well except for that time when they said they just crossed the border by accident,

  . . but it is tradition to wait for august, 
  well yeah it 's not like the mayor came to search their offices lol :d unless ofc he 's looking for his bribe or something, 
  so . . would he be an improvement over ciolo\u0219 ? 
  or not ? 
  during eurovision and euromaidan , the russian media and politicians were portraying ` the west ' as decadent homo fascists . 
  there were links right on this sub back then here 's this because i 'm lazy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_portrayal_of_the_2014_pro-russian_unrest_in_ukraine#media_in_russia there are links there long article http://goodmenproject.com/gender-sexuality/gay-propaganda-wars-russia-ukraine/, 
  the thing is that regimes like that do n't have other alternative than propaganda they ca n't survive without much censorship and disinformation / / ofc they it will eventually fail but only for a brief historical moment and then it will go the same way again, 
  yeah imagine what it would mean to him to get a free movement deal with the eu, 
  is the media supporting zeman 's view ? 
  what a coincidence it is that he got campaign money from lukoil, 
  maybe more like bribed, 
  i 've heard they actually want to expand in other countries . 
  yeah , hopefully . 
  1526 best year ever, 
  some might like that, 
  bernadette s\u00e9gol , secretary general , european trade union confederation ( etuc ) and monique goyens , director general , european consumer organisation ( beuc ) have big interest in ttip to happen ? 
  anybody got more links on this ? 
  maybe more indepth ? 
  is that some kind of bot account ? 
  what are you doing on this sub then ? 
   you know what , i 'm getting fed up of the fearmongering . 
  it 's making an actual informed critical eye on ttip near-impossible . 
  yeah true the more fearmongering i see on this issue the more i think it may not actually be that bad . 
  hehe now that these foreign companies are gon na be out and siveco too , all the money will now go to the companies of a very crooked friend of the pm 's . 
  they are taking out his competition now . 
  could n't you get a nice pic of dortmund 's ? 
  you really have no clue what he means by 107 % ? 
  or the other post with 140 % and nobody doubted that putler is n't popular, 
   and no one can take away this from us except for your politicians . 
  they are the ones thinking that and pushing that idea . 
  yeah mainly in the [ balkans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_diaspora#mediaviewer/file:romani_population_average_estimate.png ) apparently there are hundreds of thousands in the us and brazil too,
