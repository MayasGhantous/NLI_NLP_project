  he does n't want the opposition gaining more power . 
  he does ? 
  i had a feeling we 're stuck with him now looks like im right, 
  and the pm said nein, 
  yeah it 's definitely expected, 
   some not so good auto-translate here . 
  hotnews has an english article too on this but it looks like it 's google translated lol :d, 
  btw he also has a brotherinlaw and fatherinlaw ( a senator ) investigated in different older cases ( btw another brotherinlaw is the current justice minister who is n't saying 1 thing about all this !, 
  / he said saturday now that he supports him ) the pm doesnt want to want to quit and he sent a damage control letter to eu and us embassies http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-20212897-victor-ponta-scris-ambasadorilor-sua.htm in english at the bottom he 's thinking romania is turning into a dictatorship because prosecutors bring him down . 
  mind you he and his party are promoting some justice laws changes that will severely affect our anticorruption campaign ( like legalise conflict of interests which is one of the pm 's accusations / saturday now the law proposals are no longer on the parliament 's site ) for which there was criticism from foreign embassies ( dutch german us french usually ) . 
  the media behind him say all this is stalinist , a coup and the anticorruption agency is like the gestapo . 
  today 's event is also compared to the mineriads . 
  there 's a lot of propaganda . 
  the pm and his group ( even with some of the ones in opposition ) will be even more aggressive now against the current justice system . 
  the pm said after the presidentials last december than he will quit if he is accused of corruption . 
  he said the same last march . 
  parliament needs to vote to allow the indictment . 
  it 's likely that the pm will be protected and the process will be as slow as possible , vote will happen in 2-3 weeks i suspect like in other cases . 
  the recent prosecutors ' requests in other cases have not passed . 
  the president ca n't suspend him without that . 
  imo it can only pass if some of the small progovernment parties will betray . 
  one of them signaled saturday that they may do so . 
  hmm parliament approval is needed only for some of the accusations , for the stuff he did as lawyer he is investigated as normal . 
  protests planned for later today more accusations for that sova friend of his commissioner timmermans is currently visiting because of the cooperation and verification mechanism and met with the anticoruption agency 's chief . 
  no comments on the pm . 
  a few hundreds are protesting, 
  guys like him are called russland vestehrers its funny that theres actually a term for them, 
  the stronger ones favor the kremlin too much, 
  injustice lol, 
  some do this kind of low level jobs, 
  lets test on u and ur family and all ur friends first, 
  our local media does n't say he is gipsy either and trust me they would if he was unless they just dont know, 
   some garbage reporting via selectively copy/pasting the text . 
  so another quality post from / u/johnmountain he often posts some dubious articles on this kind of issues so much karmawhoring just check out his post history it 's like this is his job, 
  hmm well look at this in 2 hours this has just 3 upvotes and 1 comment imagine if the title was usa instead of russia what reactions reddit would have and some still think europe is so russophobic, 
  i suspect the news articles on this story would say if he was a gipsy but they did n't so this construction worker from rome i think was actually romanian . 
  everybody is corrupt until proven otherwise, 
  you are denying that there is conflict there or what ? 
  the death toll is over 6400 http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraine-conflict-death-toll-surpasses-6400-amid-new-evidence-russian-military-1946761, 
  yea i ca n't find the fun stuff there, 
  hmm i wonder from where they must have fished them from the black sea or something, 
  yeah things like the reports of a new offensive there are just fearmongering / s, 
  the 4th reich !, 
  haha so they investigate their failure ? 
   blazer started working at concacaf and fifa only in 1990 , and probably had nothing to do with earlier world cup bids . 
  i do n't see what is curious about that . 
  for the 1994 wc they probably have to check who was running things in the 80s, 
  why paid by morocco ? 
  lol that was whining ? 
  the butthurt one is you, 
  wtf :d, 
  he took the bribes there as executive committee member which he was part of since 1996 so long after that wc, 
  and ? 
  hehehe this is the time to browse / r/hungary but i do n't understand the language, 
  as if greece is n't a sinkhole, 
  get away with it and even get some benefits like free trade as merkel wants, 
  but it already has sour cream in it it 's vinegar and/or garlic that can be added later in ur bowl pepper too, 
  hmm reddit has a problem with that guy being mod but not with a conspiratard lel, 
  :d can i see a pic of that ? 
  gon na copy a post from somewhere else zaroschenskoye ( from where almaz-antei says the launch came from ) is located to the south from shaktharsk and to the north of amvrosievka , both of those were dnr ( the ` rebels ' ) controlled on jul 17 . 
  map from jul 18 : http://gdb.rferl.org/69ccad96-d1db-4f66-8455-41c079fcac83_w974_n_s.jpg zaroschenskoye on the map : https://maps.yandex.ua/-/cvw7ycpu ( deep inside dnr territory ) . 
  another confirmation of zaroschenskoe being dnr-controlled : http://www.km.ru/world/2014/07/30/protivostoyanie-na-ukraine-2013-14/746360-dnr-soobshchila-ob-ocherednom-primenenie - ( here they talk about how it was cruely bombed every day ), 
  lol, 
  we 've got a big problem with them here, 
  we have martenitza and that cheese too, 
  is good because we beat bulgaria again, 
  him calling for death penalty is good enough and now he can blame the eu for this not working which maybe transforms into support for him, 
  those guys are speaking russian , that 's not a romanian orthodox church . 
  the church looks russian , see the towers . 
  i do n't see how this really helps him . 
  21st century orthodoxy, 
  more like blackmailed, 
  hmm i wonder why you made a new account to post that obvious propaganda, 
  hmm i thought france voted for blatter and a few others in western europe btw how did serbia 's fa say it votes ? 
  or macedonia 's, 
  no more kebab for u guys, 
   i went a couple of times in bulgaria and driving through villages ... they seemed kinda dead to me . 
  just like ours huh, 
  hey sputnik is ok too !, 
  iirc this isnt the first time something like this happens ? 
  we have europe 's only museum dedicated to gold http://www.romania-insider.com/discover-romania-the-gold-museum-in-brad/147228/ debate on building europe 's largest gold mine to restart this year http://www.bne.eu/content/story/rosia-montana-gold-mine-debate-reopen-2015 that area was mined since the stone age http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_romanian_protests_against_the_ro%c8%99ia_montan%c4%83_project http://www.romania-insider.com/25-interesting-facts-about-romania/148319/, 
  yeah still ~ 130 killed just under putin, 
  i know which is why i said * domestic *, 
  for domestic competitions , countries like france and spain do n't have homegrown limits . 
  here is the dictator visiting disneyland in the us https://ceausescunicolae.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/yoladisneyland1970.jpg?w=600 with carter https://ceausescunicolae.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ceausescucarter1978.jpg?w=260&amp;h=300, 
  yep, 
  we did n't have good ties with moscow then, 
  who 's we ? 
  yeah this is his way to force negotiations and it is working, 
   death of novorossia : why kremlin abandoned ukraine separatist project the moscow times ` in an article published on the carnegie center 's website last week , kolesnikov said that it was possible that during those negotiations , u.s. neutrality or silence with regard to russia 's annexation of crimea was offered in exchange for russian support for the reintegration of ukraine 's rebellious regions . ', 
  so putin wins ? 
  it looks like he was supporting the war in the east , making noise and threats just to force the west into accepting crimea 's annexation, 
  i wonder if his hand raising was supposed to mean something too, 
   romanian tv had 2 hours only dedicated to the ~ ~ idiot ~ ~ `` genius of the carpathians , '' '' the great conductor '' and '' the danube of thought . ''  ) http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/15/opinion/the-genius-of-the-carpathians.html, 
  the main difference is language really , otherwise it 's hard to tell the difference :d lots of common customs , food , genes etc. 
  just asking, 
  he 's an enemy but he 's just provoking we should focus more on exposing russian subversive activities and it 's agents of influence , not on his bluffs . 
  is there a poll there done for attitude on nato/eu ( pro or not ) by age groups ? 
  i suspect there 's a lot of prorussian feeling in the younger ones and more euroskepticism and nationalism which seem to go hand in hand . 
  or is it the older ones ?
