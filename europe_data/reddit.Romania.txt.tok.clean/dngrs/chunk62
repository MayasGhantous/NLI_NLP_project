  is there a list of bans per country ? 
  the eu is simply too attractive for the countries around russia and it has much difficulty in keeping influence over them . 
  that pressure can lead to western reforms , a euromaidan in moscow which scares the chekists a lot . 
  now it relies on military force and other subversive means since it has no strong softpower . 
  maybe we had more if our pm did n't care so much about lukoil 's interests, 
  meanwhile it is considering to lift ban of moldovan products http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-pm-explains-european-choice-to-russia/27042862.html, 
   platini was one of the people supporting the qatarese world cup bid , his son is now the ceo of a company in qatar . 
  and allegedly he was gifted a picasso for his support of russia 2018 wc, 
  loss of uefa ? 
  apparently spain and france voted with sepp, 
  yeah the swiss are investigating http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/switzerland-criminal-proceedings-world-cups-798263, 
   but russia should get to host a world cup at some point . 
  when it is awarded hosting fairly, 
  just the ones that bother to vote, 
  yeah they look like indians or pakistanis, 
  [ romanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians ) = / = [ romani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ), 
  what about politicians ? 
  too early for this poll, 
  so fn chief goes to moscow and 2 days later they say this ? 
  is this their order ? 
  next they will cross the border by accident http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213, 
  and it will work so well he too will be arrested, 
  is this for real ? 
  so any panslavism going on there ? 
  he prefers the ones like putin, 
   russia 's military never invaded anything what ? 
  hmm now i know why rt reports stratfor stuff, 
   that is the end of debate on the matter as far as we the citizens are concerned who made u spokesperson ? 
  is this duda some kind of orban ? 
  i love it when crooks rat out on each other, 
  pls catch blatter, 
  ask the pm, 
  why like fatalism ? 
  it brings no motivation to make things better, 
   a lot of people mistakenly think that negotiated in secret implies being passed in secret i wonder where they learn that thing ... 
  i want some proof !, 
  who is stopping you from posting something else ? 
  yeah he went on a tour to asian commie land and he liked what he saw there what followed here were things like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceau%c8%99ima , a similar personality cult and other bad reforms . 
  lots of juche books started to get translated in romanian after his visit there, 
  tourist season coming, 
  cool, 
  lol wtf nice pick dclauzel is mod on / r/conspiration / u/dclauzel what do you think of the lizard people ?

  only in 2003/2004 did we get back to 1989 gdp level https://imgur.com/j6iu4hu, 
  meanwhile afaik poland 's debt was forgiven in 1990, 
  / r/newrussia is more interesting this story is n't even there, 
  nope, 
  there are still some that deny this kind of stuff, 
  why do n't they allow this for kosovo too ? 
  let me guess . . they do n't have the enough bribe money ? 
  also / r/conspiracy, 
  just a putinist it does look often like he 's shilling for russia but it 's his own thing , no astroturfing i think . 
  it 's called electoral tourism people are taken by bus or normal cars to many different voting stations to vote everywhere they can and these are our voting queues https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2mgec3/thousands_of_romanians_have_formed_very_long/, 
  that is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_mentality right ? 
  yeah it 's not a proper slap i want it redone , juncker !, 
  secret summit at secret mansion but we know about it makes sense reminds me of bilderberg conspiracies lol, 
  hahahha great !, 
  heil orban !, 
  it probably would not pass even most of the younger people would be against it, 
  you do n't really know what you 're talking about he 's not prime minister, 
  they rejected it so why does putin 's buddy say this ? 
   it 's because the sub seem to be disproportional represented by eastern europeans is there a way to see that ? 
  is there some poll or something done here ? 
  ie this thread has 3 westerners and 2 easterns on it , besides u and op who i doubt are easterners so i do n't see the disproportionality you talk about . 
  usually but they made an exception with the leopard then http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_1602_leopard, 
   obviously everybody not following your pathetic reasoning is a russophile troll . 
  some are just useful idiots, 
  ever tried to fry them in lard ? 
  how do they eat traditional hamburgers in germany ? 
  since the sandwich is foreign kaiser roll sandwich ? 
  i suspect we will be against this idea btw . 
  and some dumbasses still think we are just paranoid but something really is worrying there, 
  yeah we are just russophobic about russian jingoism i just love how russian apologists try to downplay that why all ur reddit posts on this 4 month old troll account are just on ukraine related threads and always supporting the kremlin 's deceitful narrative ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nashi_%28youth_movement%29 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/08/putin-russia-elections the putinjugend !, 
  weird our napolitane are these http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/401/781/10387/9101564/1/napolitane.jpg?width=638, 
  weird i never had it without some chicken or beef in it, 
  not a typo, 
   turks were never ill-treated in romania . 
  besides the usual cultural repression of minorities during communism, 
  and here is the whatabout america, 
  rt source pls, 
   mentall ill people are allowed to vote so long as we understand the purpose of voting . 
  the ones that voted here were n't allowed because they do n't have judgement, 
  chickens ? 
  lol eu members try to dictate what eu should do how bad !, 
  it would have time for that because they would n't be joining soon , not this decade probably . 
  putin is pleased, 
  nothing here, 
  how did we remove kebab ? 
  wtf it cares about being safe for business but it steals parts of other countries and gets sanctions so it is risky for investors . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  since when do russian authorities care about business trust ? 
  it 's obviously politics here, 
  dunno maybe production was halted just temporarily last april assets were seized so again it 's closed, 
  lol now i notice too :d, 
  hmm maybe this is moscow 's pressure on the riga event or some sort of response . 
  btw there are elections there this month , right ? 
   evil shhaileh was a close collaborator to former minister , liviu dragnea , she 's his goddaughter . 
   shhaileh , 50 , an economist by profession has been a state secretary in the ministry of regional development since 2012 it 's funny how she got that position at the same time when dragnea became minister she would n't be having those positions without the right connections and dragnea needs someone trustworthy there because the ministry deals with lots of eu funds and there are fraud problems some rumoured to involve dragnea . 
  i meant people that are banned from voting because of mental problems .
