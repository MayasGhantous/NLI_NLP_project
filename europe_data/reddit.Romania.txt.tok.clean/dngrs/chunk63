  obviously serious problems . 
  does moldova have any ? 
  slava putin today !, 
  i found the news article and an ngo ( for people with disabilities ) said there were 61 people ( they estimate a lot more through the whole country ) with no judgement/discernment on voting lists which should n't happen because they are banned from voting . 
  they said they have serious mental disabilities . 
  socialdems were accused of bringing this kind of people from a hospital by bus . 
  btw here in romania that tv tax is included in ur electricity bill so you pay it even if u dont have a tv, 
  what do you think those threats to kazakhstan were for ? 
  it was raided by the police http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-russia-roshen-factory-surrounded-poroshenko/26932003.html assets seized http://russia-insider.com/en/ukraine/russia-seizes-assets-poroshenkos-chocolate-factory/6192 and closed http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26661220 how 's he still making money with it ? 
  these are probably from 4chan somewhere, 
   how often does that happen holding referendums is a national sport there http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:referendums_in_switzerland, 
  or mentally sane we had insane people on the voting lists at the last elections iirc or being alive since magically the dead vote here ( that [ minister ] ( http://www.turnucustiri.ro/images/originals/colind.jpg ) sentenced a few days ago for referendum fraud is a big [ necromancer ] ( http://www.timesnewroman.ro/files/attach/images/127/401864/dragnea%20necromancer.jpg ) ), 
  you like these new things huh http://i.imgur.com/anpxreu.jpg, 
  it 's not the first time this happens http://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/content/report-israeli-made-russian-drone-was-shot-down-ukraine, 
  see the wiki link users : russia - as forpost ( \u0424\u043e\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442 ) lizensed copy http://www.upi.com/business_news/security-industry/2011/01/17/iai-delivers-12-uavs-to-russia-in-key-deal/57821295280313/ http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/israel-and-russia-in-uav-deal-05459/ i 'm not sure if russia got this model before the war but it seems to be that way . 
  i do n't understand why comment sections do n't get disabled . 
  unless media that keeps them open is also partisan . 
  great goals !, 
  they have them on the wheel covers to cut the tires of enemies in traffic, 
  even the first dacias were built with renault ( 12 and 8 ) designs, 
  they are required to i think, 
   several eu governments are reluctant to acknowledge the aspirations of some eastern partnership member countries to join the eu in the final declaration of the riga meeting . 
  which ones ? 
  i 'm guessing it 's the ones that side more with russia like hungary , greece , slovakia . 
  are n't most of the countries with much inequality the ones with weak capitalism ? 
  crony or no capitalism at all, 
  they are still checking if someone is missing i guess, 
   the spirit of the deal they signed ? 
  i 'm not even sure it exists . 
  i ca n't find details about it . 
  in the center and south you have mediterranean and adriatic too http://www.travelserbia.info/weather.php, 
  how old are you ? 
  oh that 's why priests had rooster stuff at the gay march in moldova a few days ago, 
   even gagauzia has legally obtained the right of secession in case the republic of moldova unites with romania i wonder if there is some sort of loophole, 
  hungary gets some too this summer because we have too much, 
  check out what moscow said http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/moscow-admits-two-fighters-captured-in-ukraine-are-ex-russian-soldiers/521093.html, 
  meanwhile http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/moscow-admits-two-fighters-captured-in-ukraine-are-ex-russian-soldiers/521093.html, 
  but but where are the proofs ? 
  iirc they get dismissed or something from the normal army and then signed as mercenaries http://www.newsweek.com/how-russians-are-sent-fight-ukraine-296937, 
   russia is going to level the country if ukraine gives them a reason to . 
  reasong being fighting back for their own land, 
  i searched for it before posting and i could n't find it . 
  their source is reuters, 
  hmm i guess it 's because of some attacks right after they captured them, 
  44 letters for a disease pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcaniconioza except technical ones . . 
  i dunno trivia : romanian is the only european language that can form a full 5 words sentence containing only vowels oaia aia e a ei meaning ` that sheep is hers ', 
  you mean fat shaming ? 
   r/fatepeoplehate to me was just about hating on fatties . 
  fat people hate is about hating fatties what a surprise :d, 
  plastic the stuff we import here from spain and especially turkey are really bad, 
  maybe it 's better kind of fats, 
  yeah usually old people houses have that, 
  what decorations ? 
  i guess the land there and other conditions lead to that . . ? 
   romania is eastern europe transylvanians disagree it is actually right between central , eastern and balkans overall we probably have more in common with those south of us than with the other regions, 
  they did and the car was fined, 
  yeah same here even police cars park on bike lanes http://www.hotnews.ro/zoom.html?desc=foto:%20facebook&amp;name=masina%20de%20politie%20parcata%20pe%20pista%20de%20biciclete&amp;imgurl=http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2015-05-7-20086435-41-masina-politie-parcata-pista-biciclete.jpg, 
  reminds me of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_guards_%28russia%29, 
  or geting sold to russia now . 
  reminds me of our ex pm boc https://basarica.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/emil-boc-2008.jpg here he is raising his heels http://static2.libertatea.ro/typo3temp/pics/3956-135083-22_4cf3dcab04.jpg check out sarkozy http://www.libertatea.ro/uploads/tx_images/3956-135084-21.jpg / http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/401/781/10376/4528715/1/obama-sarkozy.jpg?width=638, 
  the soviets even tried to join the axis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_axis_talks#molotov_travels_to_berlin it 's interesting how the far left and far right can work together btw http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory, 
  the bigger russian influence that would come with that could be manageable if the anticorruption fight keeps going strong, 
   this wo n't be done without eu approval that 's for sure . 
  im not so sure wasnt out last unification done without caring about what the west wanted ? 
  we did it de facto on our own afaik it depends how strong the russian lobby gets, 
   i mean it would be a good start if the eu would support moldova more . 
  it 's geting less support apparently http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-riga-summit-eastern-partnershop-/26910896.html, 
  why does that disturb you when you say ` fuck the constitution ' ? 
   b\u0103sescu did break the constitution . 
  but you know what ? 
  fuck the constitution !, 
   , just last week the parliament passed a bill making it more difficult to arrest politicians suspected of corruption i want a source for that some stuff just passed certain chambers or commissions those laws were n't sent to him yet so he atm can not do anything, 
   despite romania being a presidential one . 
  it 's semi-presidential . 
  explain to me how our president function is the one with executive power like in france or the us . 
  til the role of the president is to attack the government k i know basescu is better because he curses . 
  not even russia cares much about it these days, 
  basically a transnistria that is still properly part of moldova, 
  that again shows how important orthodoxy is for russian imperialism, 
  you forgot to say something about ww3 too, 
   not only that , but the recent islamic ( uck ) albanian terrorist attack was brushed off by nato and the eu not true there have been responses where do you learn these things ? 
  is the prorussian media there doing this ? 
  lol you are saying there is a conspiracy of the albanians with the west to send terrorists there ? 
   and as you might know , they 've been present in most of the post 89 ' governments in romania . 
  hell they were often kingmakers, 
  any russian people there to defend from gay fascism ? 
  is it even possible for the eu to kick a member ? 
  it would n't have much influence on the decision anyway since they are too few, 
   that will require some land grab also from today ukraine i 've never heard about any interest in that in any reunification talks, 
  he can go protest then and vote when the time comes . . 
  ~ 3/4 in romania want it in moldova it 's close to 1/2 i noticed that the elites are more open to this than the average people, 
   in galizia , in the north of spain , it is usually said that the `` deaths go to vote '' , because there have been a lot of scandals of death people whose vote magically appear . 
  same problem here, 
   we hungarians endured too much of bucharest 's theft to put up with any more go protest then or move to hungary, 
  media says 25 thousand people protested there on the occasion of 203 years since russia annexed moldova it 's the 2nd big protest in less than a month ( first one was about that billion dollars that was stolen iirc ) they want closer western ties ( there are doubts that this course is kept ) , corruption fighting and they criticise the governmen and russia ( they go in front of their embassy ) the event is organised by unionists and one of their leaders was banned from moldova a few days ago, 
  numbers of those prosecuted show great difference and it makes sense because they are the biggest, 
  the socialdem party, 
  maybe he should get trolls to ask the questions, 
   i admit that most of it is ** stupidely written propaganda ** . 
  i just consider it 's important to get access to ** alternative views ** really ...
