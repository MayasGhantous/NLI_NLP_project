  yes yes puppet of america , now puppet of china . 
  ok why is rt promoting this ? 
  some of europe is in russia 's pocket too hey op why do you like russia today ? 
   also you totally ignored my part where i specifically said it 's an advantage for china to use russia as bad cop in their good cop/bad cop relationship . 
  how is china the good cop really ? 
  take ukraine 's war for example they do n't support sanctions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis#/media/file:sanctions_2014_russia2.png china reacts with full understanding to the challenges and threats russia has faced in connection with the ukrainian issue ** and supports moscow 's approach to its settlement . 
  ** '' [ 43 ] chinese foreign ministry 's european-central asian affairs department , gui congyou , told russian media china just has less bad pr but there 's not much difference between them . 
  it too is aggressive regarding other countries territories , it just did n't ( yet ? ), 
  go as far as russia . 
  they do n't support this either http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_68/262, 
   new cold war with hopefully nothing to do with europe . 
  yeah if europe moves to another planet there 's no way that will happen since both sides fight for influence here, 
  china and russia peaceful hegemony lol, 
   the outlet is reportedly being investigated for `` conspiracy to encroach on ukraine 's territorial integrity and inviolability . '', 
  the ukrainian government has not presented any publications by the outlet that would support these charges . 
  so that means they were promoting support for the russian invasion and now russian state media sputnik complains ? 
  it 's funny how sputnik cares about media problems in other countries while in it 's own country it is even worse . 
  how many journalists were killed there just under putin 's terms ? 
  btw sputnik propaganda platform yesterday expanded in moldova, 
  the investigation started in late 2012 iirc ( was still minister ) but he and the pm did n't want him to quit because of the accusations , not even during one of the cabinet reshuffles . 
  the sentence is maybe weak but it 's not final and sometimes punishment is raised later he 's the 13th investigated minister of the current pm 's cabinets 12th sentenced in the last years ( more than 20 still investigated or on trial ), 
  are the czech that poor ? 
  there 's a lot of porn done in germany too, 
  we 're not in the poll data but i 'm pretty sure we are similar to poland , even slightly higher . 
  yeah not us, 
  but the local gypsies already can, 
  russia braindrain ( government thinks giving 25 euros per month more to medics ' wages will solve the problem ) decentralisation and changing the constitution which already failed because too few came to the referendum but they wan na try again schengen and joining euro eu funds absorption rate talks because it 's low ( just 56 % and with only one year left for the 2007-2013 program ) but slowly improving ( btw a 1bn euros fund was blocked a few days ago because of corruption said the pm . . meanwhile his brother in law is caught stealing eu funds through a firm even he ran years ago and it involves his mother and sister . . which btw it magically got a lot more state contracts since the guy became pm ) politicians fight over what highways to build while the dacia factory ( important for the local economy ) might move to morocco because it might not get a road it wants illegal logging and there were protests these days and the pm and his party tries to turn the protests against the president even though his party is really the one with very obvious links to that issue corruption . . pretty much daily there is something going on , a county council boss or a mayor or an mp or some searches in private business or in universities , big hospitals , key state agencies etc ( today one of the presidential candidates from last year was indicted . . he 's the 3rd candidate with indictments . . one already jailed ) right now mps try to change some justice laws in a very bad way legal recognition of same-sex marriages rejected a few days ago . . same for creating some kind of sex ed class some kind of big brother laws are being worked on ( no terrorist problems here except that some of them pass through here ) the pm is already in campaign mode for the summer 2016 parliamentary and local elections some agitation with the tax agency that has been a lot more active recently and some people have been upset by some things government implemented some kind of health cards and the implementation sucks . 
  my grandma could n't get her prescription today for her cancer because the it system or something was n't working properly . 
  lots of people pissed , big queues . 
  the crooked pm says all the criticism is bs because there is some kind of lobby against his great reform ( which is needed btw ) . 
  they came 3rd 3,881,129 ( 12.6 % ) of votes it 's quite a good number i know they only have 1 seat but public opinion still matters, 
   get the feeling that russia-weary eastern europeans have more faith that the us will have their back than any of the more established european nations yes and only the uk comes close even though ukip is high in polls in the rest the kremlin lobby is strong, 
  you saying we were hating america until now ? 
  no it is 300/100 fiber http://www.rcs-rds.ro/internet-digi-net/fiberlink?t=internet-fix&amp;pachet=digi_net_fiberlink_300, 
  yep, 
  in european history , the middle ages , or medieval period , lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . 
  it began with the collapse of the western roman empire and merged into the renaissance and the age of discovery . 
  maybe the renaissance style makes it medieval http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pele%c8%99_castle, 
  ours lasted til the 60s too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_anti-communist_resistance_movement, 
   instead they got http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yalta_conference, 
  somebody call putin, 
  built between 1873 and 1914 . 
  its inauguration was held in 1883 . 
  that and the fact that the state let the industry grow wild initially which was good, 
  the west funds and controls it ? 
   but ironically nuclear weapons are the greatest guarantee of peace we have ever invented . 
  without them , cold war would n't have remained cold . 
  with them ukraine wouldnt be invaded i wonder what iran thinks of this, 
  those who have 200 mbps subscription will get 300 ( same 9 euros price ) the 100 mbps sub gets upload raised from 30 to 100 ( same numbers inside the network and externally btw ) plus some other benefits like a few free hd channels ( it 's also one of the biggest cable providers ) this is my speed with the 300/100 sub http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4361332947 . . 
  i think i need a ssd ? 
  reminds me of schroder, 
   if the goal is to reduce corruption , then you do n't need to jail people . 
  many in our institutions and private sector can in no way be ` changed ' . 
  they know nothing else and they do not care to be otherwise . 
  this beheading is a short term solution obviously and much needed as a first step . 
   people just have to stop being corrupt k, 
  a western war hawk gets hired by russian oil firms ? 
  this does n't make sense, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_romania_and_moldova#current_trends he said thousands were expected at the event , he has no law troubles , he was given no reason or anything . 
  our ministry is asking for details the communists ( who are against reunification ) back the current government, 
  found this so far http://www.unian.info/politics/1063011-us-was-warned-about-russian-threat-to-crimea-in-2009.html / http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/vladimir-putins-coup-112025_page3.html#.vvsmv03yc70 after transnistria and georgia it was kind of predictable, 
  i wonder if there are any numbers for how many of those tanks , planes , etc are actually usable for war . 
  you broke the link, 
  us chopper over a mediaval castle http://imgur.com/a/bb7sa virtual tour if someone is curious http://visit.peles.ro/virtual-tour/ pics http://imgur.com/a/pbbm9#0 http://www.archiki.com/peles-castle-blend-themes-styles/ / / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin_americanii !, 
  parliament is voting many amendments ( around 20 or 30 . . some are similar but they are forwarded separately to get them bigger chance to pass i think ) that affect the strength of the anticorruption campaign including no more arrests for those who do n't commit violent crimes ( ie you can destroy evidence and not be arrested like 2 ex ministers have done ) or be caught for corruption that changes arrest requirements in such a way that it then may happen very rarely so think experts another change to the way conflict of interests apply and one change already passed for the way incompatibilities apply which is something many politicians are affected by something to make it easier for cases to be destroyed something for how denouncements can be used ( very important tool for prosecutors ) fines for prosecutors if they do n't get sentences in their cases prison for prosecutors in some situations some other stuff i ca n't translate some of those who came with the proposals ( some are close to pass everything needed in parliament ) are mps ( in power ) indicted or with other law troubles and one was even sentenced yesterday ( one of them is godson or something of the pm ) one of the initiators also wants to try again to pass an amnesty and pardons law that failed to pass a couple years ago ( we have many very influencial people sentenced . . one very dubious guy just fled to cuba through monaco a few days ago after an investigation started ) the opposition is secretly ( some openly ) supportive of the changes , just the president commented a bit . 
  the pm ( ex prosecutor btw with 2 relatives investigated ) and most of the partisan media ( who 've been very manipulative about the anticorruption prosecutors in the last years ) are all ok with it . 
  the justice minister ( pm 's brother in law ) is ok with them too . 
  the government also wants that for disclosing off the record information from an undergoing file you ( prosecutor , judge or journalist ) get sent to jail no street protests are happening, 
  you think it 's ok to send the army because of a truck crash ? 
  and now it 's idiotic because there were terrorist attacks in the neighbour country k, 
   get your shit together romania , again you are in the last place :d ah not again :(, 
  maybe he means that it is a branch in itself among the indoeuropean ones and afaik it has common genesis with ours, 
  did you get tased ? 
  it would be so much better if the * russian tourists * would stroll like that, 
   then again many professional analysts ( and i 'm merely a casual observer ) could n't foresee what happened in ukraine , so who knows what putin will do next ? 
  wasnt there some speculation about crimea or something from a polish minister a few years before ? 
  yeah who decided that ? 
  ud get invaded if u were orthodox brothers, 
  isnt the us independent from imports of that ? 
  well tbf iran can cause more trouble, 
  they probably get remembered that often since moscow likes to threaten with them just last april http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-threatens-to-use-nuclear-force-over-crimea-and-the-baltic-states-10150565.html, 
  so far none , not in very obvious ways like in other countries anyway . 
  there is though a new rightwing party being formed , one of those jobbik/ataka type parties . 
  elections in summer of 2016 . 
  so stupid, 
  hehe kremlin translators censoring merkel live, 
  in the 80s we were a big it center having many factories to produce computers ( felix pc ) and other electronic devices ( 2nd producer in the commie block after urss ) . 
  the first chinese it specialists were trained here and we exported much to them , germany , the middle east , poland , czechoslovakia . 
  we were the first in eastern europe to build a computer . 
  because of ceausescu antimoscow stance ( like against cz invasion ) he was helped by de gaulle to get banned it technology and licences for iris50 . 
  he had some conflict with the american ibm that did n't want to build him a supercomputer . 
  we had billions of dollars invested . 
  it all went to hell like with many other industries after the revolution when those in power were too busy stealing everything they could n't before . 
  it was preffered to ` help ' those firms go bankrupt and sold to crooks that had real estate interests . 
  mainly to meet the requirements and solve the frozen conflicts there 's also the crimea issue, 
   therefore no anti-tero agencies are required since we have a perfect balanced ecosistem . 
  and anyway the chief of our antitero organisation is under arrest, 
  putin 's end game ? 
  a new yalta, 
  i find it hard to believe that there wo n't be at least one veto from one of the eastern eu countries .
