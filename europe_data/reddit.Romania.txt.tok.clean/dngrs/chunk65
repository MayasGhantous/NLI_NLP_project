  there are also the big reforms needed to happen to allow membership which may need to become stricter anyway, 
   pro-enlargement wording in eu declarations on ties with former soviet states is set to hit an all-time low at the riga summit on 21 may . 
  a win for putin and the kremlin backed far right then . 
   another eu source said germany is the main opponent : `` all the keys are in berlin . 
  that 's why rinkevics [ the latvian foreign minister ] will fly there next week to find a deal [ on the joint text ] . 
  but so far , germany is adamant there 'll be no movement , especially on the [ eu ] aspirations of eastern partnership countries '' . 
  obviously because germany is america 's puppet / s definitely no kremlin lobby there  a european parliament report , endorsed by the foreign affairs committee in brussels the same day , says there can be no `` business as usual '' with russia until it stops the `` hybrid war launched against ... ukraine '' . 
  no giving back of crimea or dropping support for the donetsk people 's republic ? 
   dont think that the usa has been and still is the mother of all oligarchies ? 
  http://rt.com/business/russia-households-wealth-creditsuisse-169/ excluding small caribbean nations with resident billionaires , wealth inequality in russia is the highest in the world . 
  35 per cent of the household wealth in russia belongs to 110 billionaires . 
  that makes it ok, 
   how can you support something when its content is unknown ? 
  currently there is no ` something ' since the trade text has n't been released which will happen before it comes to voting . 
  once eu and us negotiators have come up with an agreement , eu governments - together with the european parliament - will examine the text and can approve or reject it . 
  eu laws states that trade agreements like ttip can only be signed if they are agreed both by the governments of the eu 's 28 member countries and by a majority in the european parliament . 
  and with a china deal , negociated in the same private way or in worse conditions , the same people that bitch about ttip wo n't say a thing about that one . 
  no worries about the trade deals with japan , india , vietnam . 
  well op usually posts leftwing stuff, 
  yeah meanwhile in greece https://imgur.com/a/xbmku http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/angela-merkel-pictured-with-nazi-commanders-in-greece-as-war-reparation-dispute-continues-10127488.html, 
   for five years , the greeks have been publicly shamed , insulted , humiliated and spat upon by the rest of europe . 
  i did n't know i was doing that . 
  til, 
   russia supports macedonian pm always with the bad guys, 
  ah so his problem is that he was n't the one running it, 
  i thought it will be france . 
  what food do they serve in the cafeteria there ? 
   but every post about it here gets either downvoted to hell or deleted . . it 's pretty obvious why many europeans do n't like their militarism , is n't it ? 
  wtf, 
  a day later iirc no parade, 
  or promoted if it is because of incompetence and has connections, 
  they should show it in a special way like make it grey on the map or something, 
  it needs to be de jure for it to be added on maps, 
   well , at least for us lithuanians , it 's because of the occupation following the victory of the soviet union but why then did the west go there at the other victory parades ? 
  check out who went in 2010, 
  zeman and fico already did reunite there :d, 
  read about zuma for a bit and you will see he matches with putin http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacob_zuma, 
  i do n't speak spanish, 
  i think he means this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_venezuelan_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat_attempt#allegations_of_us_involvement, 
  ok oh it 's 60th now, 
  judging by what ? 
  if we look at hdi then it ranks 91/187 which is n't great http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index, 
  i do n't see it . 
  k np does my thread now appear on the sub ? 
  go compare the best of each to see the potential of each system ie norway and north korea http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index, 
   do n't pretend the romanian church somehow holds people back it is part of the problem and you overestimate how much those mps do it because of what people think . 
  mind you currently the same mps support laws that limit the power of the current anticorruption campaign even though most people like how it is . 
  why did fidel wear an adidas tracksuit to meet with hollande ? 
  deputies in the justice commission rejected it too today unanimously this reminds me of an episode last summer when an mp offered to a deputy ( very influencial one in the main governing ` socialdem ' party ) a rainbow flag which he then threw in a trash bin ( the guy is currently investigated in a couple of cases btw http://www.romaniajournal.ro/hrebenciuc-adam-and-chiuariu-indicted-in-illegal-forests-retrocession-file/ http://www.romaniajournal.ro/hrebenciuc-prosecuted-in-new-influence-peddling-file/ ) somewhat related : the senate also rejected creating a ` health ed . ', 
  class in schools teaching sex ed. , hygiene stuff and about drug use after initially being allowed by deputies . 
  these things get blocked because of the massive power the priests have during the elections some , especially the higher rank ones , take sides to influence voters in return for state funds and other advantages from politicians . 
  yeah people living in norway , sweden , denmark , switzerland , netherlands , canada , ireland must be jealous of china , north korea , qatar , iran , saudi arabia , cuba , vietnam , syria , egypt , congo , sudan , russia . 
  here is the full report https://openrussia.org/post/view/4803/, 
  found these in the original thread over in / r/ukrainianconflict http://news-front.info/2015/05/10/zamministra-oborony-dnr-opolchency-stali-polnocennoj-armiej/ http://petrovka38.ru/document/23906 the new nemtsov report has it too on pg 52 https://openrussia.org/post/view/4803/ their source there seems to be \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a : www.kashin.guru, 
  where can we see the details of the report ? 
  is it in english ? 
  k https://openrussia.org/post/view/4803/ im hoping it gets translated, 
   i heard that some people from serbia not from eu but president was there, 
   for a bit of additional context : fico was one of the few people from eu which went to moscow this past weekend to celebrate victory of wwii and to honour the russian forces which allegedly freed slovakia . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/moscow_victory_parade_2015_vs_2010.svg on 9 may just zeman and fico came for the parade im not sure what greece did or the cyprus president, 
  another interesting thing abut the leadership there the dnr 's minister of defence is a wanted criminal in russia https://twitter.com/stateofukraine/status/597836320665395200 http://news-front.info/2015/05/10/zamministra-oborony-dnr-opolchency-stali-polnocennoj-armiej/ http://petrovka38.ru/document/23906, 
  what a stupid question is there some place in the world where ` all ' people agree with one guy ? 
  what 's really funny is that he is against the eu so further centralising disturbs him even more . 
  yeah now thanks putin for helping us push this forward, 
   ironically , they also hate us . 
  no more orthodox brothers ? 
   we were naive some were willfully ignorant, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_bolshevism that dugin guy is a national bolshevik, 
  it was too good to be true for him to quit, 
   they did n't do it because they disliked jews , but because they were dicks oh that makes so much sense, 
   `` poland and romania have a very tech savvy population read more at http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/e-regulation/us-cyber-mission-russia-168000#yefltfc1r50kcreq.99 btw we plan to teach school kids cybersecurity classes and create some university specialisations on that subject, 
  same, 
  minsk 3 it will totally work this time, 
  no no it must be a conspiracy !, 
   fuck i hate rt. 
  hey you are being russophobic, 
   albanian terrorist army is caught in macedonia , they give official statement that they want greater albania and no reactions from usa and eu . 
  there have been some http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/10/us-macedonia-police-iduskbn0nu06x20150510 nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg called for calm and a `` transparent investigation to establish what happened '' . 
  ambassadors of the united states , european union , osce and nato issued a joint statement saying they hoped the drama would prompt leaders `` to pull together and engage in dialogue on all issues facing the country , including the protracted political crisis '' . 
  http://www.france24.com/en/20150510-several-22-dead-macedonia-police-battle-armed-group-albanians any further escalation must be avoided , not the least in the interest of the overall stability in the country , '' eu enlargement commissioner johannes hahn said in a statement late saturday . 
  did you even bother to search for some reactions ? 
  very weird, 
  i 'm curious to see how the russian backed parties in the eu like the front national would react to this happening . 
  they are against the eu expanding but serbia is favored by russia . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalin_and_antisemitism hmm why so many downvotes ? 
  do we have upset stalin fans here ? 
   but while standing next to german chancellor angela merkel , he appeared to justify the molotov-ribbentrop pact which the soviet union signed with the nazi regime in 1939 . how are the german media and other commentators there reacting to this including politicians ? 
  wake up and make another pact, 
   but people here told me ukraine 's economy will make a magical bounce-back !!, 
  who said that ? 
  how should one trade with an invader ? 
  it kinda did here, 
  tell that to ukrainians , georgians and moldova !, 
  after the new frozen conflict is done and without giving crimea back now he wants reconciliation ? 
  i bet he wants that free trade deal too . 
   and not lose more coastline . 
  i kinda like southern dobrogea though . 
   falling from 65 % to losing 1st turn must hurt . 
  reminds me of our pm going from 55 % to 45 % in just a few days all polls showing him to win 55-45 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_presidential_election,_2014#second_round then the surprise comes and he loses with that score :d vlach magic, 
  dunno . . just chitchat i think,
