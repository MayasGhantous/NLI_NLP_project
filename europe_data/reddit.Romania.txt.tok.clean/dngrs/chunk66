   no leader from central europe will ever go on record speaking russian . 
  i saw a video of zeman speaking to putin this weekend . 
  i think he was talking in russian but i 'm not sure . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7kuw_v2il8 i wonder what he is saying about czechoslovakia there !, 
  representatives of countries , especially of the more important ones , speak their own language just because . 
  it 's better than what dumb representatives of smaller ones do , trying to speak foreign languages that they are actually bad at even though there are translators available . 
  like some of my presidents have done . 
  here is basescu speaking english https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv9dq4rkq00 this kind of speaking he used in bruxelles meetings and on other occasions iliescu spoke it badly too, 
  he 's fluent in german https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2frvopgwxf0, 
  30 % would have voted for it last year in may it somehow went down to 20 % in december after klaus became president ( btw he has good relations with the royal house and even had dinner with the king after winning ) . . 
  i 'm guessing they are ok with the republic because they like the new president too much ( 76 % support in last polls ! ), 
  and ex president basescu made presidency very unpopular 30 % think it should have been adopted right after '89 ( king was removed by blackmail of the commies ) but it did n't happen in part because the highly contested new commies that stayed in power tried their best to prevent it blocking the very popular king ( still ranks very high in polls 61 % ) from entering the country until '97 when people calmed down a bit . 
  romanian independence day is today a few weeks ago parliament declared it national holiday ( it was banned since '45 - they used 9th because 10th is associated with monarchism - and for some dubious reason it was n't brought back until 25 years after the fall of the regime that banned it ) http://www.romaniajournal.ro/may-10-declared-national-holiday/ the state seems to have organised no events to celebrate it and the president and pm just said a few things about it on facebook ( there was a garden party tho held by the local royals ), 
  romanian native english from school and kindergarten , through internet use and cartoons ( say no to dubbed stuff ! ), 
  french from school but i forgot much even though i was good at it because i do n't really have reason to use it very little german, 
  3rd ranked for the pm is bangladesh with 11k wtf ? 
  and 3k in india :\\, 
  what vlach magic did you use to find that data ? 
  it looks legit !, 
  i did some google searches for some local articles on this kind of stuff there 's a woman named fatcow ( vac\u0103gras\u0103 ) and a guy called bred pit also some people are called hitler ( family name ! ), 
  or ` the judge ' , dacia , logan , solenza ( car names ) , police , justice , minister , television , pharmacy , the stupid one , bin laden , superman , miss america , asscheek , the drunkard , garbage , booger , coffin , president , the dead one , the faculty ( uni ) , ferrari , roberto-bagio ( one g ) , tom-mac-bil-bob-constantin ( one name ) , pele santos and some more weird ones . 
  some gypsies use these names . 
  we had a new law a few years ago banning ridiculous , indecent names of newborns ive never met someone with weird names, 
  i 'm more worried about rising russian fascism than some albanian nationalists in the balkans . 
  btw this worry reminds me of the warnings that the next problems wo n't be with the baltics threatened by russia but with the balkans, 
  hehe :d if you doubt that then im curious what you think about this president having 1.5 million ? 
  https://www.facebook.com/klausiohannis 94k at the end of august . 
  870k after winning the elections . 
   the georgian conflict has ended . 
  that is still a frozen conflict why do you not understand that you can not force diplomacy onto russia ? 
  it runs by a different thinking . 
   absolutely no one forgets this . 
  this is why merkel denied participating in the parade no , . 
  she did that in protest over the ukraine crisis . 
  she would have been the first to arrive there if it was n't for that . 
  btw do you think schroder would have went if he was chancellor now ? 
  i think yes . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_moscow_victory_day_parade she was there in 2010, 
  they have n't had the occasion to learn that just check their history no soviet union over them and no communism either no russian empire problems, 
   and to think that russia would really care about the greek people is quite hilarious , it sincerely cares much about the orthodox brothers ukrainians , moldovans , georgians can confirm, 
   there is no reason whatsoever for europe to antagonise russia more than necessary merkel said ' in remembrance of the millions of dead for which germany is responsible from world war ii . ', 
  so btw when will russia be responsible for the soviet crimes ? 
  problems here too in the capital the vaccination rate dropped under 80 % compared to 97 % a year earlier some kind of tv celebrity and priests ( but usually some kind of religious ngos ) are promoting this, 
  the president rejected that new forestry bill against which enviromentalists protested why would the guy in the logging firm 's pocket do what enviromentalists want ? 
  it makes 0 sense or are u saying the protesters are also paid by that firm ? 
  we need sdds, 
   option b : these attacks have been orchestrated by the government to gather support for their cause . 
  kinds reminds me of what our authorities were doing in 1990 in targu-mures conflict http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t\u00e2rgu_mure\u0219 the securitate ( romanian ` kgb ' ) who were kept in the new system , the whole new regime were heavily contested . 
  some think it was a manipulation orchestrated by them to legitimise the ` new ' ( 2nd echelon commies not really interested in western reforms ) rule , stop some protesting and instill the fear that the magyars ( foreign enemies ) would steal transylvania . 
  they managed to make both ethnic groups fight eachother in a place that was otherwise very peaceful . 
  the conflict was created mainly through media propaganda and it made most people who were otherwise against the very dubious new regime to support them massively in the elections ( 67 % for fsn ) out of fear of extremists . 
  investigation on that closed in 2005 after the deeds were prescribed . 
  it 's not hard to believe this stuff when knowing that the same bastards called miners all through the 90s against the prowestern protesters which resulted in injuries of more than a thousand of them and over a hundred deaths ( unoffical numbers ) . 
  it 's funny how this story gets little attention on this sub if it was the americans spying during some chevron talks then the sub would go berserk, 
  well who would be so disturbed by how finns report the ukraine conflict ? 
  isis ? 
  north korea ? 
  it must be the damn swedes the crisis is their fault in the first place https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2yfuxq/russia_blames_sweden_for_ukraine_crisis/, 
  found something on / r/conspiracy :d i was expecting something to pop up here and the uk vote theory came quite late just 4 hours ago  ) https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35e7qi/uk_concerns_over_ballot_rigging_after_lastminute/, 
  http://morometia.ro/ofcr/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/bor-legionari-mitropolitul-balan-casa-verde-sept-1940.jpg heil jesus ? 
  death in workcamps awaited you too if you were born the wrong way during communism ( rich families ), 
  then the balkans would be more red, 
   ( just intellectuals ) . 
  not just intellectuals , anybody who tried to resist the new system and there were many who rejected russian imperialism, 
   former minister pana finds such notions laughable . 
  ** she always carries the text of the romanian constitution in her handbag and pulls out the dog-eared page with article 135 , which she has evidently looked up many times before . 
  the text says that the state is obliged to protect national resources . 
  ** they only care when there is political interest ie now to fight the president the pm 's ( pana btw is from his party and was in his government ) own father-in-law is investigated for illegal forests retrocessions worth 300m euros . 
  the same politicians were supportive of that rosia montana goldmine project so they do n't really give a rat 's ass about protection of resources . 
  also the pm postponed for another year the raising of royalties rates which are some of the lowest in the world and he is in lukoil 's pocket which he also tries to protect in a 200m euros tax evasion case . 
  again with the constitution the same group of politicians voted a few weeks ago to save an ex minister ( buddy of the pm ) from arrest in parliament . 
  they voted by majority of total nr of mps which the constitutional court said was not right . 
  they should have voted by majority of all those ` present ' so again they do n't care about the constitution . 
  he may not have been saved if it was by the proper majority calculation . 
  btw today a few hundred people protested against illegal logging and the president supports them, 
   and all of europe bullshit do i have to explain to you people what the installment of communism meant ? 
  http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/chinese-leader-tops-meager-victory-day-guest-list/520378.html greece is the only one from the eu it seems their list on the side is n't complete tho i think serbia 's president is there too also un secretary general ban ki-moon . 
  cuban president raul castro , venezuela 's nicolas maduro , zimbabwe 's robert mugabe , and egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi , south african president jacob zuma erdogan sent the ambassador, 
   and what music should we play on this occasion ? 
  if you support russia then you are true sovereign , independent , man of the people etc. 
  if you dont then you are the puppet of amerika, 
  ah ok i searched for the original article the question is ` do u think u are european citizen ' 71 % yes 22 % no and the rest dunno/no answer, 
  u mean 35 ? 
  23 % believe the contrary , and 11.4 % did not respond . 
   but hey , following kremlin 's media might not just give the impression . 
  is rt in french yet btw ? 
   6 % of gdp for education ( which is mandatory according to the law ... ) it 's 3.5 % now btw  3 % of gdp for research and development again our law ( from 2011 which was never respected ) says 1 % but it is 0.3 %, 
  he already has much support so i do n't see why that matters, 
  about the czech ? 
   but other eastern european countries like estonia definitely do . 
  give examples of what estonians do that is like what these bikers do, 
  lol, 
  it 's not russia 's business what deals the eu makes with other countries, 
  i guess he means the russland-versteher , putin 's apologists , the bear huggers . 
  who did he vote with ? 
  which would bring much stronger sanctions, 
  dunno why but other media say it 's actually 750m dollars, 
   yea that 's not going to help you in the slightest . 
  russia already has a hard time dealing with ukraine otherwise the conflict would have been over already, 
  there 's a lot of medicine you still pay for it 's not all covered,
