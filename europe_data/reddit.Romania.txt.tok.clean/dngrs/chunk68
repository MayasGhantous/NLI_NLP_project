  i wonder how many of them are even part of the lower class, 
  some people care about spying here so maybe this is kinda relevant, 
  english article http://news.yahoo.com/romanian-mayor-suspected-using-police-spy-rivals-074310659.html, 
  they may not like the communists either ie http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_romania#post-war  during the period of transition towards a communist regime in romania , following soviet occupation ( see soviet occupation of romania ) , jewish society and culture were subject to the same increasingly tight control by the authorities . 
  the community leader wilhelm filderman has been arrested already in 1945 and had to flee the country in 1948 . 
  [ 71 ] on april 22 , 1946 , gheorghe gheorghiu-dej attended a meeting of jewish organizations and called for the creation of a new body , the jewish democratic committee , which was in reality a section of the romanian communist party pcr . 
   after the proclamation of the people 's republic of romania , the government formed by the pcr outlawed all jewish organizations at a meeting on june 10 -- june 11 , 1948 , stating that `` the party must take a stand on every question concerning the jews of romania and fight vigorously against reactionary nationalist jewish currents [ that is , zionism '' . 
  between 1952 and 1953 the stalinist antisemitic charges of `` rootless cosmopolitanism '' brought about the purging of the party 's own leadership ( including jewish ex-premier ana pauker ) ; [ 73 ] the charges were then inflicted upon the larger part of the jewish community , beginning with a trial engineered by iosif chi\u0219inevschi . 
  [ 74 ] jews who were perceived as zionists were given harsh labour sentences in communist prisons such as pite\u0219ti ( where they were subject to torture and brainwashing experiments ; a few of them died in detention ) . 
  [ 71 ] the 1952 trial of the engineers made responsible for the failure of the danube-black sea canal project also involved allegations of zionism ( notably aimed at aurel rozei-rozenberg , who was eventually executed ) . 
  [ 75 ] gays http://www.vice.com/read/what-it-was-like-to-be-gay-in-communist-romania-876  in 1968 , when dictator nicolae ceau\u0219escu finally recognized that homosexuality existed , he immediately deemed it illegal . 
  throughout ceau\u0219escu 's reign , the government persecuted same-sex couples by sentencing them to years of hard time in prison . 
  gipsies  in communist central and eastern europe , romanies experienced assimilation schemes and restrictions of cultural freedom . 
  the romani language and romani music were banned from public performance in bulgaria . 
  in czechoslovakia , tens of thousands of romanies from slovakia , hungary and romania were re-settled in border areas of czech lands and their nomadic lifestyle was forbidden . 
  in czechoslovakia , where they were labeled as a `` socially degraded stratum , '' romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population . 
  this policy was implemented with large financial incentives , threats of denying future social welfare payments , misinformation and involuntary sterilization . 
  [ 43 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_romani_people handicapped people during communism the disabled and mentally ill were sent to orphanages where they were very abused http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_orphans , drugged and got hiv . 
  no the romanian orthodox church is even more rotten than our parties, 
  he ( an ex socialdem , ex conservative and writer on voice of russia ) is very little known here even though recently he seems to appear almost daily on a certain mainstream tv channel he 's working on a political party for the next 2016 parliamentary elections which seems to be much like the usual populist rightwing antiwestern/pro russia , china party we see all over europe now 2 ` nationalists ' got - added together - 4 or 5 % in the last year 's elections and they are old , used figures . 
  this guy wants their voters . 
  http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheorghe_funar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_vadim_tudor wait a bit and you will hear more about him :d, 
  good idea, 
  i 'm curious if they will run again next year . 
  borbely can and i think he has party support . 
  vosganian may have to find another party first . 
  not sure about sova . 
  if they run , they have good chances to get reelected . 
  romanians have no problems voting very dubious people . 
  in 2012 we voted into parliament a guy ( a nobody . . people care more about the party name ) sentenced for rape . 
  it 's still going pretty strong there 's another arrest request to be voted soon a few days ago the mayor of a relatively big city was arrested and it turns out he used local police as a personal spying service ( on businessmen and a girlfriend ) also a few days ago the head of an institution that manages state properties ( worth a few billion euros or something like that ) got arrested . 
  there are often stories about dubious sales done and sometimes even sentences . 
  recently a big part of the crooks ( and their media ) seem to have grouped together against prosecutors and there seems to be some help from the church too so there 's definitely a fight going on . 
   `` the father-in-law of europe '' . 
  and the queen marie of romania was the mother in law of the balkans, 
  other 3 are ex minister vosganian http://www.romaniajournal.ro/former-economy-minister-vosganian-escapes-prosecution-following-senate-dismissal-vote/ ex minister sova http://www.romaniajournal.ro/senate-oks-valcovs-arrest-sova-avoids-detention-due-to-lack-of-quorum/ ex minister borbely http://www.romaniajournal.ro/ooops-they-did-it-again-lower-chamber-stops-judicial-investigation-in-borbely-case-ec-to-watch-closely-the-developments/, 
   their carrot is eternal friendship the orthodox brothers crap, 
   watch rt and sputnik they give truth to you . 
  question more, 
   they seem to believe they can influence things solely by bullying and threats . 
  they never actually offer anything i guess that means moscow just ca n't compete normally . 
  pyongyang will support it 's fellow kiev junta, 
   robert pszczel sounds polish . 
  i bet it makes moscow like him a lot . 
   on a russian state tv chat show , pszczel was constantly heckled midsentence , harangued as a `` russophobe '' for his ethnicity ( he 's polish ) , and called upon to explain the ( entirely invented ) claim that hundreds of polish soldiers had been killed in eastern ukraine . 
  surprise surprise, 
  iirc this is the first time i ever reply to you and how does a just 13 words comment show ' a very vested interest ' in that ? 
  yeah typical shill tactic, 
  how funny you do n't trust a thinktank but you believe a blogger network https://globalvoicesonline.org, 
  it 's a conspiracy the jews must be behind this, 
   take public opinion in two central european countries with historically contrasting views on russia : poland and bulgaria . 
  bulgaria is central europe ? 
  the source is some kind of tabloid press, 
  we do have paid trolls in politics . 
  check out what prosecutors said about udrea and pdl postaci, 
  my problem is we produce little and we look like just a market for other countries ' goods . 
  already said banks, 
  oh yes !!, 
  i forgot, 
  church , mall , pharmacy , supermarket , pharmacy , pharmacy , bank , bank ( sometimes 2 or 3 of these in the same apartment block at the bottom floors ) , church , supermarket , bank , mall , hypermarket , pharmacy , supermarket , church , bank , church . 
   europe should exclude military spending out of the french deficit '' same for us because we are bordering a war zone . 
  our plan to raise spending first by 0.3 % of gdp got blocked in bruxelles because of a 1.8 % deficit limit . 
   france : `` we pay for the security of europe with money from military business with jingoist russia . 
  we hardly buy russian stuff anyway, 
   how do people even drive cars with your income and western fuel prices ? 
  other priorities for the money in return we spend little on books , medicine , cultural stuff . 
  vat , excises and some kind of new ` super excise ' ( we 've been having it for a few years already iirc / with which the stupid government is gaining less money than without it ) make 60 % of the price our prices in gas stations are the highest we ever had , the current taxes on that are the biggest in the last 6 years and the influence of international prices seem to be 0 . 
  sometimes prices even just go up for some bs reason . 
  then we should have some kind of strasbourg in each member country, 
   but who do you have , bulgaria ? 
  putin . 
  check if what they say is true ? 
  who needs depleted uranium when you have broomsticks, 
  rt : lithuania goes full fascist, 
  unless you are were a chekist, 
  i love how some people are so defensive of russian propaganda . 
  anything being done about it 's incredible toxicity is automatically ` just the other side 's propaganda ' . 
   david cameron wo n't become prime minister , and there is strong evidence that `` yes '' could win if he does . 
  why ? 
   but how large of a role does the us take relative to the eu in economic development in these two countries ? 
  afaik it 's not even top 10 investor 10 biggest export partner , 18th biggest for imports . 
  https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rou/ there are just some energy firms here and that 's about it, 
   alliance with the pro-russian communist party . 
  it 's not so sure how pro-russian it is, 
   nothing such as neutrality exists in post-soviet space . 
  yeah in moldova 's case how does neutrality work when you are under illegal foreign military occupation ? 
  iirc at the osce 1999 istanbul meeting it commited to withdraw the troops so probably yeah a bit of history on this http://www.moldova.org/russian-troops-in-transnistria-a-threat-to-the-security-of-the-republic-of-moldova-20998-eng/, 
  support how ? 
  there are n't nato troops fighting in ukraine , there probably wo n't be in moldova too . 
  there 's nothing about territory there, 
   nato 's second in command in europe has , just like the new president of romania , insured they 'll protect the territorial integrity of moldova . 
  bradshaw did n't go that far http://www.globalpost.com/article/6526535/2015/04/23/nato-deputy-commander-europe-promises-help-moldova-strengthen-military, 
  that army was supposed to leave by 2002, 
   also some dacias are branded on certain markets as nissans , ladas , pictures ? 
  yeah and in some places they dont even use the dacia tag , just renault . 
  renault logan http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/renault_logan.jpg dacia logan http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/dacia_logan_front_20070611.jpg, 
  so far, 
  wtf, 
  someone with serb flair posted it , not him . 
  repost https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33r72w/ukrainian_soldiers_burning_prorussian_prisoner_on/ i call bs this kinda reminds me of the made up story about that 10 year old killed in ukraine http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32137302,
