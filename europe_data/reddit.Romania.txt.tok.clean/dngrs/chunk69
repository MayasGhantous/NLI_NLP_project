   from what i hear the main goal for now is coordinating infrastructure projects to maximize their usefulness for everyone involved . 
  yeah bulgaria wants to transport gas and serbia wants electricity, 
   tip for the next time : find a stuntman , make him really burn . 
  and use flame resistant clothing plus some kind of gels for the skin, 
  ah yes let 's forget about putin 's wars . . that 's not interesting . 
  you can make your own threads if you are so disturbed or maybe look for other subs https://www.reddit.com/r/tourism/ https://www.reddit.com/r/history/ https://www.reddit.com/r/historynetwork/wiki/listofhistorysubreddits, 
   from what i understood it 's people from azov , the far-right paramilitary group . 
  from where did you understand that ? 
  we do n't even know if the flame was put out because the video stops right after the fire starts . 
  it may very well be a propaganda video . 
  unless there 's also full video . . maybe somewhere on liveleak since youtube does n't allow too weird stuff otherwise i have a very hard time trusting this video the shock value is great against those naive and/or already have a certain bias to be confirmed and is thus great propaganda, 
   ** i am fed up of russian ** or ukrainian ** propaganda ** bullshit, 
  u jealous ? 
  huh is russia an empire now and ukraine and georgia were part of it ? 
  wrong sub / r/conspiracy, 
  in return u make it rain with cevapcici https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s40f_pev0_y, 
  organised crime group ? 
   hungarian opposition leader viktor orb\u00e1n called the russian intervention an `` imperialist abuse of raw power '' and drew parallels with the smashing of the hungarian revolution of 1956 lol check out how opposition orban was now he 's putinist, 
  not really  `` rossiya segodnya '' directly translates from russian into english as `` russia today '' , but should not be confused with the tv network rt , which was known as russia today prior to 2009 . 
  [ 1 ] however , the station is sometimes referred to as `` russia today '' or the `` new russia today '' in foreign media . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] that segodnya owns sputnik http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sputnik_%28news_agency%29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29, 
  it 's very strong in the balkans and less so further north, 
  yeah it 's very surprising, 
  so what happens now to the russian gas stream through turkey ? 
  did ur old troll account get banned by the jews ? 
  / u/yellowcakewalk, 
  haha, 
  we win again, 
  dont u have lots of politicians with business interests with russians ? 
   with a russian majority it 's a third ukrainians , a third russians and a third moldovans/romanians, 
   moldova also dreams to reconquer transnistra , do n't you remember the moldovan-transnistrian war ? 
  how could i forget the fuck up of russia . 
  the satellites start realising they can look west and be independent from moscow and suddenly there are these wars . 
  are you a troll or something ? 
  you question me but some days ago you were posting youtube stuff about ukraine nazi junta genocides, 
  i know you like russian press better so you can find some russian links in the wikis i posted, 
   is it a risk for europe ? 
  transnistria is a hub for organised crime , smuggling and human trafficking so yeah even uranium is smuggled there http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/30/uranium-smuggling-arrests-in-moldova-revive-security-debate.html http://www.investigatii.md/eng/index.php?art=221 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_transnistria http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mafia_state#transnistria https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/transnistria#.vs5m803yc70 http://www.democraticunderground.com/101750069 http://www.channel4.com/news/fear-football-and-torture-undercover-in-transnistria http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/atlas-hoods-weapons-smuggling-youth-cults-in-the-country-that-doesnt-exist, 
   romanian why ? 
  afaik there is also a proposal to set it as national day instead of dec 1st, 
  maybe it would n't rhyme then, 
  i really really do n't think they were thinking of walesa . 
  they meant the communist party 's activists . 
   than someone who cares about his country/people/earth ? 
  the kind of people criticised by the protesters were n't like that we 're talking about ceausescu style communists , not some fantasies western leftists imagine . 
  lol, 
   many of the fsn personalities , including its president , ion iliescu , were ex-communists and as such the revolution was seen as being hijacked by the fsn / the protesters also disagreed with the official doctrine of the fsn that the revolution was only `` anti-ceau\u015fescu '' and not `` anti-communist '' it 's one of the reasons why the romanian revolution looked like a coup, 
  61 % of greeks http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/pg-2014-07-09-russia-favorability-02/ but maybe greece is turning into a pariah too, 
  some numbers done with some 2013 data by pew http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/ russia 's global image negative amid crisis in ukraine, 
  the mining law you said about http://lege5.ro/gratuit/gq3danjx/legea-minelor-nr-85-2003 page 2 or 3 article 45 says 2 % royalties for coal , metal and nonmetals , noble and radioactive metals , aluminum , etc. 
  it 's even worse than what 4 % i said . 
   art . 
   4 % is applicable to coal only . 
  http://www.economica.net/cine-exploateaza-bogatiile-romaniei_99527.html this press article says 4 % for coal , metal and nonmetals , aluminum , etc. 
   yet , it is the most gentle tax regime in europe ie we have some of the lowest royalties in the world between 3.5 % and 13.5 % for oil and gas industries and 4 % for mining, 
  check his post history on this kind of threads he 's commented on these issues lots of times already, 
   only if you believe in a war with russia which is an unrealistic scenario . 
  a couple years ago it was unrealistic for ukrainians too, 
   as long as the rights of the romanian ethnics are protected . 
  and as long as it respects the constitution which it would n't, 
  it is n't a nato exercise ? 
   invention origins are more from south of us tho, 
  they already have much more than our romanians have in chauvinist hungary, 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11365674/ukraine-crisis-angela-merkel-offers-russia-free-trade-deal-for-peace.html http://www.dw.de/merkel-and-gabriel-offer-russia-free-trade-agreement/a-18211951 from january, 
  yeah business as usual and rewards for irredentism, 
   one european parliament lawmaker btw there 's a guy in the ep that needs his immunity lifted http://www.nineoclock.ro/mep-dan-nica-may-be-left-without-immunity/ we 've been waiting since september, 
   `` russia is a country of resources , and environmentalists are the main enemy of the established regime of the natural resources oligarchy . '', 
  but but putin beat the oligarchs !!, 
  ! 11 hero of the people, 
  redditor for 58 minutes, 
  is this some kind of jobbik/fn party ? 
  because judging from wiki yeah http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns_party  the party combines left-wing economic policies [ 16 ] with conservative social values , socio-cultural authoritarianism , and ethnic nationalism . 
  [ 17 ] several researchers have described the party as fiscally centre-left , socially conservative , [ 18 ] a `` centre-based populist party '' or the `` most left-wing of the non-socialist parties '' , whereas other scholars have described them as radically right-wing populist . 
  [ 17 ]  foreign and defence opposition to the european union [ 58 ] [ 59 ] opposition to admission to nato [ 58 ] [ 59 ] will they govern ? 
  btw democratic by who 's standards ? 
  putin 's like in crimea ? 
  if yes then no, 
  yeah minorities that do n't want to integrate is not a problem makes sense, 
  remember that after we helped the czar against the turks then ( at his request ) , the russians stole land fron us immediately threatening us when their troops were still here . 
  afaik our first constitution was based on belgian model, 
  that does sound like a problem, 
  btw i remember reading a year or two ago about some romanian workers being kept in slavelike conditions in portugal, 
  i oppose fradulent referendums imposed with guns, 
   but some of this buggers still cling to romania as hell and do n't want to leave . 
  some meaning most of them, 
  and more russian influence instead good thinking, 
  spoke what ? 
  so what is this , a propaganda song promoting russian irredentism ? 
  but russia is the legal heir and successor of the soviet union . 
  same as with the presidents in the republics ? 
  why would it be an issue ? 
  still imposing themselves by force on other countries today, 
   but people like you who imply that we need the trade deal right now and better sign it right away otherwise we face economic catastrophe , show me where i said that . 
  the other 2 were new ( pics from last year btw ) dunno why i included that pic too i found it weird that he would delete his posts after a while . . why do they disappear from his post history ? 
   many in the west see russia as aggressive and brainwashed . 
  but its citizens have a different view ~ 15 % of them judging by putin 's approval rating, 
   there 's nothing wrong with it ? 
  there 's something wrong with the fearmongering and propaganda, 
  talking about online support for these things tell me why are there redditors with new accounts promoting antittip propaganda ? 
   implying tanks are n't already present in eastern ukraine , for those not aware https://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2sotqu/amazing_job_120_russian_tanks_on_donbass_spotted/,
