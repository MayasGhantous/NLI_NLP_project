  http://www.romania-insider.com/former-romanian-intelligence-director-fbi-started-the-microsoft-licenses-corruption-case/132402/  former romanian intelligence director : fbi started the microsoft licenses corruption case i kinda feel like if it was n't for the fbi these guys would have no problems . 
  maybe they think they are part of russia or something, 
  i bet he thinks putler is also a flawless democrat . 
   the resulting division of europe will more or less be to everyone 's advantage mainly for russia and whoever is friendliest towards it, 
  btw is n't chirac friends with putin ? 
  he called him ' a personal friend ' a while ago, 
  source ? 
  nope, 
  it worked so well the last time . 
  russia is the one bring it upon itself . 
   n russia there are no more homophoby than in other countries . 
  i want some proof that russia is no different in that view than the netherlands , the united kingdom or the us . 
   of course , there are some countries which would prefer seeing russia weak siege mentality kicking in  we are heading to a normal european-styled country if by normal european you mean belarus , kazakhstan or azerbaidjan then yeah . 
  unless ofc you think that the rest of europe will turn more like russia in which case you may be right a bit ie hungary , turkey . 
  140 % lol @ 3 ) that 's why there is need for so many journalists to be killed . 
  i bet it 's the fascist homogay zionist enemies of russia that kill them as false flag to make russia look bad , amirite ? 
  / / hmm you made a new account for this, 
   as i said , i 'm not supporting either side 's actions here that 's a lie, 
  yeah but they can move fast and do quite a lot of damage in eastern europe until the heavy cavalry arrives, 
  much of it would be in deep shit until russia would get pushed back, 
  it is understandable to fuck up neighbour countries for wanting to join the eu ? 
  not ukraine . 
  the deceitful bastards said `` russia does not rule out future nato membershi - rogozin defence minister '' . 
  how interesting it is that they then forgot their nato expansion criticism and how it is supposedly against russia . 
  then they again complain about ` gentlemen 's agreements ', 
  it shows russia complaining about ` the west ' instead of looking at gorbachev 's own incompetence . 
  the oral agreement was between kohl and gorbachev so just between the germans and urss it does not affect nato one bit so go cry to merkel overall it is gorbachev 's own failure for not agreeing that with all the nato heads themselves and having it in writing too . 
  face to face . 
  like all proper negotiations happen . 
  this ` issue ' is quite pathetic . 
   coup it was a revolution , not a coup . 
  you keep parroting propaganda . 
  you better hope it wo n't happen because you 're gon na be on the wrong side, 
  i thought that putin is the best seen figure for serbs . 
  a country so close to becoming a dictatorship like russia needs a foreign enemy to keep the people united ( thus diverting attention from their own government ) when that need is higher then you know that the rulers there are very worried about losing power they are the ones looking for war russia is actually a partner of nato http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_nato hmm  in april 2009 , the polish foreign minister , rados\u0142aw sikorski , suggested including russia in nato . . how times have changed, 
  well hello good morning oh wait  merkel said on monday there were good reasons to continue the european union 's energy partnership with russia for the time being but that might change * if * moscow * continues * to violate basic principles . 
  huh ? 
  so she is giving them another chance ? 
  again ? 
  i kinda feel like merkel will get a nice job reward at gazprom after she 's done in germany .

  fk off, 
  that they . . really are fascists !, 
  maybe schroder already told him a long time ago  ), 
   ... and the current unhappiest country of the eu . 
  i n't it bulgaria or greece ? 
  dude this is n't / r/conspiracy, 
  / r/conspiracy and rt, 
  i got a neighbour that really , really loves his drilling tools . 
  i ca n't understand what work he has there to do since he 's been using it often ( as in at least weekly and at all kinds of hours - not the unallowed ones ) in the last * years * . 
  i should respond to this by buying a really big drilling machine ( and use it on hell knows what . . maybe i will get some stones in the bathroom and use it there ) and use it as the same time as he does . 
  asserting my dominance like that will make him stop . 
  maybe bring one of those balkan brass orchestras to play at his door too . 
  a couple months ago my old neighbours from right above me moved away and the new ones are fucking * very * often , at all kinds of hours and in every room , kitchen , bath everywhere . 
  they are making quite a lot of noise but only furniture noise , no voices . 
  they need a new bed i think . 
  it seems to me that 3 young women live there and only 1 guy . 
  i 'm jealous . 
  so it 's a threat ? 
  and why would russia deserve this ? 
   the caretaker justice minister said on friday that ec may separate bulgaria from romania in the monitoring of reforms in justice and the fight against organized crime and corruption this could mean one of us will get into schengen probably us, 
  no wonder they care so much to appease him . 
  i 'm pretty sure they came here themselves . 
  you know , nomads . 
  it 's * after that * that they became slaves ( more like serfs , really ) . 
  you think we went to india to trade for them ? 
   has anyone ever met a gypsy who has a proper job ? 
  yeah and they are usually some kind of romanianised gypsies meaning that they are just like most people but with darker skin really . . there are some that keep their traditions and they are [ metalworkers ] ( http://mesteshukar.ro/images/uploads/cld_07.jpg ) ( they make pots and things like that ) or [ musicians ] ( http://jurnalul.ro/pictures/2013/07/26/18458601.jpg ) there is little attention to these, 
  um no this only helps sustain their ambitions, 
  conspiracy theorists tend to view things a lot like rt or the other way around :d, 
  what a hypocrite, 
  you should become a politician, 
   has your parliament indicated something in connection to this ? 
  afaik no politician has said that he is against ft with canada ( or the us ), 
  wo n't there ~ ~ will ~ ~ * still be big problems on paying pensions later ? 
  i do n't see why visa to canada or the us is so important . 
  braindrain would be even bigger and the people that would leave are part of the voting base that is harder to trick ( this is why politicians have interest in it i guess ) . 
  those are regional powers , not superpowers . 
  but but it 's not a problem because kgb just does n't exist anymore no worries, 
  yeah it 's really a mistery how russian army soldiers are dieing in ukraine or those little green men in crimea, 
  we sympathize with gay euro nazis, 
   every superpower is preparing for war . 
  they all have plans . 
  and not everyone does what russia does . 
  those plans you speak of are defensive ones btw and russia has attacking ones too . 
  how is it a * superpower * ? 
  this is n't exactly the urss ( it 's the legal heir but economically and military it 's not even close ) anymore . 
  the only one is the us . 
  here 's one way to show their common interests farage wants the uk out of the eu and first line countries people out of the uk . 
  that fragmenting works in putin 's favor too . 
  i thought they already picked russia, 
   i do n't think they would be soft on russia if it bothered nato members something tells me they would be when it comes to romania and bulgaria, 
  does it specify what kind of assistance ? 
  maybe it would be just logistical, 
  hmm actually it 's not like that http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/sep/08/le-pen-tops-presidential-poll-for-first-time-ever she could defeat hollande but lose to sarkozy and everybody else dunno where i got the 80 % and le pen in my mind . . 
  determined and well armed people thinking differently wo n't protest then, 
  lol superpower  they are n't pushing for a conflict , they were forced into one those imperialist pigs are pushing russia into ww3 , right ? 
  i want to see him thrown in a dumpster !, 
  ~ ~ afaik le pen has ~ 80 % support in polls for the presidential elections ~ ~, 
  they would be prorussian enough to just close their eyes or just talk and do little .
