  in the eu there are 4 other countries that do n't recognise it cyprus , spain , greece and romania . 
   i think it 's a good sign that we do n't have secretive societies these days . 
  freemasonry today is just discreet, 
   so disgraceful to pull the minority card while the anticorruption prosecutors are led by a magyar, 
   he is not in hungary . 
  his own lawyer said he is there and met with him :d  about a certain woman named k\u00f6vesi , nothing . 
  no news at all . 
  never heard of her . 
  the first lodge here was made in 1734 or 1737 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freemasonry_in_romania the revolutionary fr\u0103\u0163ia group was probably french inspired http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachian_revolution_of_1848#pre-revolutionary_events_and_outbreak, 
   as well as inside a wall in his house . 
  and under the beds lol, 
  hey send the convicted deputy marko attila back here he 's wanted in another investigation and hiding in budapest apparently the government there protects him, 
  3 days old account, 
  busy day yesterday http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/04/02/world/europe/ap-eu-romania-corruption.html?_r=0 plus an exminister keeps staying under arrest because she lost the contestation, 
  we need this too there are lots of dumbasses influenced by conspiracy sites and priests here vaccination rate for 2014 went under 80 % for measles , mumps , dpt and rubella . 
  even for the capital it was 78 %, 
  that does n't sound bad, 
  btw pravda.ru a few years ago was saying that muslims will be majority in russia by 2050 http://english.pravda.ru/history/21-07-2008/105837-russiaislam-0/ http://www.interpretermag.com/immigrants-will-form-half-of-russian-federations-population-in-2050-experts-say/ also a bit related http://www.wsj.com/articles/study-projects-growth-shifts-in-worlds-muslim-christian-populations-1427983415, 
  what is so unfair about having some troops here ? 
  i still dont understand the problem, 
  there just is n't one in the real world and there probably will never be one, 
  sputnik.com just kidding, 
  name 1 organisation that has equal partnerships not even the un is like that i thought we with our military spending much under the required 2 % are equals with those who do ? 
  shocking maybe you miss the warpac or do you want cis instead ? 
  actually how is bringing some nato troops here when there was ( still is ? ), 
  war next door something ` unequal ' ? 
  it 's just for show anyway what is equal partnership ? 
  we are already a target for their nukes because of the missile shield http://rt.com/news/217823-putin-russian-military-doctrine/, 
  the people he 'd need approval from ( if ) are probably his puppets, 
  it 's part of a ressurance campaign you conspiratard you think the government will show itself as putinist or something otherwise ? 
  as if they care about some troops which can be asked to leave if wanted so they just said yesterday btw that they are ok with placement of * anything * here ( relating to the missile shield and future placing of some heavy equipment ), 
   is anyone taking the risk of russia going full retard seriously ? 
  it 's just a method of manipulation, 
  phobias are irrational being disturbed by moscow is n't irrational, 
   there is a swiss nation really ? 
  streisand effect ? 
   dutch : not from deutchland . 
  from dacia according to our rightwing nutjobs, 
  for us  french is understood and spoken by 24 % of the population . 
  [ 10 ] historic cultural ties with france , especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century . 
  oif is an international organization representing countries and regions where french is the first ( `` mother '' ) or customary language ; and/or where a significant proportion of the population are francophones ( french speakers ) ; and/or where there is a notable affiliation with french culture . 
   and you think paying them better will do anything ? 
  look at the case of magistrates ( prosecutors and judges ) they had wage reforms and they have started to do a much better job, 
  in romania they dont add up i just checked the pm 's income statement for last year and the deputy money is n't there , just what he gets as pm . 
  rich ** er **, 
  you can resettle too then, 
  check what date is today, 
   look at greece or italy , high wages , just as corrupt politicians . 
  and a lot richer and better developed countries, 
  in case it is not obvious there is a problem finding people that selfless, 
  great idea is n't it, 
  in the asian steppe ? 
  well it kinda makes sense, 
  we will know in the coming months, 
  yeah a president of a nato/eu member geting only 1500 euros if putin really wants destabilisation then he should stop spending on expanding the propaganda machine here and instead spend the millions on bribing our politicians ( lukoil already backs the pm ), 
   i do n't think politicians wages should be too high . 
  neither do i, 
  one could say the invaders of ukraine are terrorists, 
  yeah here in romania there is a bit of talk about the ` professionalisation ' of the political class and there is need for much better wages ( one is reason is what good skilled guy will come work as finance minister for a bit over 1k euros when he can make many times that in the private sector ? ), 
  but there is much populism against this and then people are surprised why people who earn that are tempted to steal from the billions worth budgets they manage, 
  it 's 1.5 k euros / month and the pm has 1.4, 
  no u wont, 
  which is not happening anyway it 's just merkel and hollande , nobody from the eu . 
  april 1st ? 
  and pays for war damages, 
  5th column russian propaganda name 1 crimean tatar terrorist name 1 example of terrorist propaganda in crimean tatar media meanwhile lots of terrorists ( and some mercenaries paid by russia in ukraine ) at least in the middle east are actually from russia ( chechnia ), 
  that 's just some bullshit from the partisan media opposing the anticorruption campaign arrest when you have big crooks trying to influence witnessess or that have destroyed evidence ( like it happened with 2 ex ministers last month ) is right, 
  but but pawns of amerika !, 
  i do n't think you understood what i meant :d think of serbia as something that could damage russia from the inside ( the same way it could make trouble in the eu ) they like to play one side against each other much and not actually join a political group ( see tito-stalin split and the non-aligned movement ) one could think they could bring much difficulty for russia then with it 's eurasian project, 
  fun times ahead ... 
  i 'd love to see greece join the eurasian union . 
  same for serbia . 
  they could mess up russia a lot more than sanctions . 
  they forgot about the big demographic challenges too, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/definitions_of_fascism skim through it and tell me it 's not very similar to what 's happening in russia ie prof. paxton 's  a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline , humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity , energy and purity , in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants , working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites , abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion, 
  weird do n't these pollsters have them up on their websites usually ? 
   guess , what ? 
  russia is putin and putin is russia . 
  yep that 's the cult of personality going on there, 
  out with greece from the eu . 
  how about russians ? 
  does the survey show ? 
  or other neighbours, 
  a dumb article writer from a local tv channel 's ( one of the most followed in the country ) news site called dhkp/c ' ** far right ** marxist-leninist group ', 
  i rather think they do this for the view of the local russians, 
  russia is n't communist tho . . far from it actually just right-wing orthodox authoritarian it 's ideology is closer to our legionaires from the 30s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_guard than communism - a combination of fascist political ideology and religious-nationalist mysticism our patriarch miron cristea https://imgur.com/6gxjoil meanwhile in russia https://imgur.com/a/mx2by the priest with white hat is patriarch kirill i think, 
  i 've never seen someone do it like that except in old videos . 
  ceausescu too did it like that iirc . 
   the ussr ~ ~ liberating ~ ~ occupying berlintsi , the town in northern moldova/bessarabia that ussr occupied . 
  yeah it was definitely blue before him, 
  is this scrollable ? 
  this page does n't have a scroll button and i cant see the other stuff, 
  since when is it a problem that russians ca n't pass through ukraine ? 
  it matters that at least they are n't against or `` neutral '' like they were before, 
  which they could do anyway just because they can, 
  something around 800-1600 somewhere around that . . along with most or almost all or moldova 's military equipment afaik the problem is if little green men come from crimea, 
  moldova asks and accepts help for that btw there is the 5 +2 format ( russia , moldova , transnistria , ukraine , the osce and observers from the eu and the us ) but things are n't progressing i know merkel is interested in the problem and other foreign officials but putin needs these frozen conflict zones to manipulate, 
  i bet you live far away from russia, 
  cool, 
  the kremlin website shows that so it must be true,
