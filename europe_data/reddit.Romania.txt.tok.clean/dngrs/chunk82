  is lukoil investigated there too ? 
  lol, 
   us-aligned saudi arabia decided to ramp up production within two months after the eu and the us announced an `` economic solution '' to russia . 
  the same us aligned arabia also hurts ur shale industry with that move, 
  its a propaganda channel for whoever is in power it has some good shows otherwise ( much better than most of the rest of the media ) but the bias is very obvious on big issues ( like when the colectiv fire happened they showed nothing about it iirc in that night ) financially it has very big debt , lots of money wasted in suspicious ways like with all state firms . 
  the orthodox brothers bullshit didnt stick well here, 
  turndown rate is low tho around 10pc, 
  yeah its weird and orban was vicepresident of epp for 10 years til 2012, 
  dunno how u can fill dried peppers, 
  glad someone else noticed this too, 
  i guess it is because they are more or less as backwards as us so they cant be well liked, 
  just until his group gains more power then he will become more radical for now he is like orban in the initial phase, 
   bulgarians inexplicably like russia . 
  ( kinda understandable after 45 years of communist brainwashing ) the thing is romania wasnt very friendly with russia even in communism ( during ceausescu ), 
  state relations are kind of average , cultural too . 
  see serbia and ie the minorities problems, 
  for this poll they just pick some countries to ask about not being in it doesnt mean much ( relevancy towards romania and some randoms ones , neighbours that stuff ), 
  western institutions are still very popular too, 
   peppers stuffed with beans link ? 
  we use rice in it  rice in cabbage leafs i love the meatless version :d can even eat it cold, 
  this would have 3000 upvotes if it was us in the title instead of russia, 
  iirc putin did warn kazakhstan, 
  yes in particular in the apartments with more than 2 rooms ( some have 3 or 4 ), 
  stevel seagal, 
  certainly some sarmale and sweet bread cozonac my homemade sausages are done and just earlier today i put them in the freezer maybe boeuf salad or thats for new years . . 
  convenient ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia last time i counted it was ~ 100 under putin, 
  its more for propaganda purpose ` please us or we bring ww3 ' then you see the supporters with their arguments that you have to accept what the kremlin wants or ww3 will totally happen . 
  it 's for the fear effect and it 's not aimed at politicians or other elites . 
  it 's a good bluff i guess . 
  is this the 1930s or 2015, 
  no snow, 
  and one of the old batman with freezer dude or penguin,

  as we all know only those who support russian interests are without bias . 
  only they are with logic and realpolitik . 
  only rational decisions come from those of western background . 
  only wisdom and great vision . 
  they are also the only ones who are sovereign actors , the rest are just puppets . 
  the rest are just paranoid easterners , nutjobs , russophobes . 
  a threat to world peace and prosperity . 
  are you serious ? 
  russia itself cancelled south stream http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/russia-confirms-decision-abandon-south-stream-final-310712, 
  romania isnt importing any russian gas anymore, 
  its reddit everything leads to ww3 here, 
  russia has some strong leverage with mainstream parties too see ie germany 's spd, 
  so can we get some gas pipe or something through there ? 
  i remember some big discoveries or something in israel 's waters, 
  i dont think i can name more than 2 or 3 of those spaces, 
  also trump said iirc that he will work well with putin the 2 like each other, 
  k and i propose lustration of all fsb , commie party and ex kgb guys in russian politics, 
   but i do n't understand the knock on romania here . 
  i suppose there is pressure ( mediatic ? ), 
  in hungary comparing their problem with what we are doing about it and orban tries to answer or in the internal rhetoric we are the baddies and anything done like us means its bad and great orban will protect hungary from that, 
  btw with who else could have merkel 's party govern ? 
  when they had elections there were other formulas too without spd, 
  no shit ideally for them the world should have to pick between isis and assad so for them the other factions need to be taken out of the picture its one way to raise support for assad, 
   correct me if i am wrong but the national liberals started this whole anti-corruption campaign , yes ? 
  it was a demlib justice minister who promoted some big reforms years ago, 
  hurr durr arresting crooked politicians is an attack on democracy literally a coup, 
  budapest politicians are very upset when magyar politicians here get investigated . 
  they act like it 's something opressive which is far from true . 
  the romanian crooks moan a lot too comparing prosecutors to the gestapo ie . 
  i really doubt russia wants transnistria . 
  its expensive to run and more useful as is to destabilise moldova, 
  cyprus as a backdoor into nato they could join romania, 
  so the eu turned against eastern partnership countries ( see failed riga summit ) but it wants serbia in . 
  what is the difference between them for the eu ? 
  i see it accepts only russia 's partners . 
  is this berlin dictating ostpolitik in bruxelles ? 
   most people do n't want the latter . 
  source ? 
  most people where ? 
  russia teaching others democracy lol, 
  they have their own politicians to complain for their own sanctions, 
  still voting extremists is gon na make their situation even worse, 
  wisely in the sense that they can give the impression of sanctions but not really hurting anything vital to putin its a cunning thing, 
  yeah im gon na wait for final decision, 
  merkel and hollande ignored that issue in minsk . 
  afaik there are no sanctions on things like gazprom it if actually hurt russia where it mattered most then the eu members wouldnt have put them on i think, 
  thats not sarcasm , right ? 
  another trojan horse would be great for the kremlin, 
  well this is new they dont call them fascist now ? 
   do n't think europe has fucked up either the middle east europe had colonies there for syria you can blame the brits and the french, 
  cool, 
  yeah it will mean a lot more jihadism, 
  what is the first match ? 
  lol, 
  too late, 
  yeah populists love eu money see ukip 's http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/former-ukip-mep-ashley-mote-jailed-breathtaking-absurd-500000-eu-expense-swindle-1510603, 
  so scary / s, 
  the question is exactly ` after the paris terrorist attacks , what should the attitude be towards refugees ' no wonder the number is so high, 
  the commies arent winning all over europe, 
  its funny how much this sub downvotes negative stories on the saintly hero le pen, 
  sounds very populist, 
  yeah diplomacy is good but only when russia wants it too which is not the case . 
  it wants to impose itself by other methods so it is pointless to deal with it that way . 
  cant force diplomacy on russia and it basically sees it as a weakness . 
  russia is upset by turkey and it 's lapdogs in the eu have to follow kremlin 's policy, 
  btw is fn still doing false flags ?
