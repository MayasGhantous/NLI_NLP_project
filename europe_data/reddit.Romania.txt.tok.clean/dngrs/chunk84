  now it gets a bit of the middle finger . 
  ie for this shit http://www.thelocal.se/20141223/romanians-go-hungry-as-mega-cathedral-rises-to-the-heavens the almost pharaoh-like project was begun in 2010 and is due to be completed within a couple of years . 
  the costs remain undetermined but will be measured in hundreds of millions of euros . 
  french newspaper le figaro estimates that the figure is likely to reach a billion euro ( $ 1.2 billion ) . 
  in one of europe 's poorest countries there are resources to build a 125 metre tall cathedral complete with golden arches at the same time as a mother and her four children are forced to live in a shack without water or electricity . 
  also the rich orthodox church in romania is very crooked and keeps losing popularity, 
  and the church runs quite a business, 
  there is even a video in a paris church where the priest tells people to vote ponta and near him are psd party members and another one in a local church, 
  hm why not blame the jews too, 
  its the literal translation theres a secretary in the ministry of culture for religious cults, 
  our socialdem ex pm ponta said a year ago when visiting china that he ` is an admirer of the chinese communist party ', 
  i really dont like how a state outside an organisation thinks it has a say in who joins one that it is not even part of so it doesnt actually have a say in it . 
  except in romania , 
  gulag for minors, 
  of course it got removed it was about european gaming ffs, 
  hmm til rockstar is scottish, 
   berlusconi is marriage witness ( what you may call best man in the us ) of erdogan 's son iirc one of the guests to that event was romanian ex pm nastase ( who went to jail 2 times ) it 's interesting how big crooks gather together :d,

  somewhere in jail i hope, 
  germany is against collective buying . 
  it cares greatly about the kremlins core interests . 
  putin would probably burn any aid now anyway . 
  or just syphon the money . 
  nvm the quote is erdogans i thought it was davutoglu 's, 
  the group 's leader says it was just firecracks for new years im guessing this is some kind of default lie of those who get caught with this and have yet used the bomb they also pretend they are oppressed victims , oh the poor neonazis :( the unfinished device used an airsoft grenade and some kind of plastic balls prosecutors found during searches 210 2nd and 3rd category explosive materials , military nightseeing equipment ( its a paramilitary organisation ) and some other stuff . 
  then he changed his mind and rules of engagement were changed btw actually that was said by someone else iirc, 
   last year he was approached by someone who asked him if he was willing to teach a group of ten to fifteen people combat shooting and military first aid . 
  yes the separatists do paramilitary ( ideological and physical ) training here . 
  some have background in hungarian army or the french foreign legion . 
  ie the szekler legion group used to do them 2 times a year here . 
  dunno if it still happens . 
  our state is quite tolerant of these guys . 
  this guy was a member for a while when he later lived in hungary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduardo_r%c3%b3zsa-flores the current leader tibor revesz is linked to flores and someone 's killing a few years ago https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_martin_dwyer in 1998 he gained some kind of certification in dismantling home made bombs, 
  restoring big hungary borders budapest indirectly or not support these kind of movements here, 
   poland is n't a puppet state of russia anymore yeah they should instead work through berlin to have it tell poland to stop that, 
   russia is no longer the soviet union it is the legal heir, 
  remember russia is the legal heir to the soviet union, 
  quelle surprise, 
  the safety of their bridgehead in the balkans thats a gain,

  because soros is literally hitler, 
  even assad 's government buys oil from isis also russian oligarchs are involved too, 
  im a bit surprised by the numbers with like half the people being rural with no plumbing so no proper bathrooms i find it hard to believe the 84 %, 
  so more than half do democracy, 
  more trade means more leverage for china . 
  it depends if in the future they will be cooperate or get more aggressive ambitions ( local territory conflicts ) and blackmail us i dont trust china, 
  there is money available and its not the eus problem that its not used, 
  they 've been going on a much different path long before the migrant crisis, 
  wtf he didnt lose the pulitzer !, 
  uk maybe i understand but wtf is going on in france ? 
  no wonder le pen is first in polls,

  new troll account, 
  meanwhile united states treasury sanctions russian oligarch kirsan ilyumzhinov for providing support to the government of syria , including for facilitating syrian government oil purchases from isil https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl0287.aspx, 
  why would they need to after this week ? 
  because of the plane thing ? 
  thanks for playing right into isis propaganda this surely helps fight against them, 
  and they thought it was syrian then, 
  tell that to the rebels who did that . 
  the pilots were bombing them, 
  russian oligarchs also support isis oil business, 
  looks like he lied, 
  lol what bullshit, 
  more dots, 
  good luck forcing cooperation on putin, 
  maybe they suspected it was syrian, 
  reddit is american based so you should look for a new site if u dont then u are just looking to complain, 
  indeed russias main focus is on bombing rebels so one could say putin is indirectly supporting isis maybe his internet cheerleaders will notice, 
  hows the weather in st petersburg ? 
  how to say no in turkish, 
  russophobia of course russia does nothing wrong of that kind why suspect it, 
  so russia was lieing shocking why would russia lie ? 
  so how would the numbers be without that taken into account ? 
   for the mistake why was it a mistake ? 
  raise a fence ? 
  oct. 3 : one russian fighter plane crossed into turkish airspace near yayladagi . 
  it was escorted out of turkey by two turkish f-16s . 
  oct. 4 : russian fighter aircraft entered turkish airspace in the same region , over the hatay province , again ignoring repeated turkish warnings , according to nato . 
  oct. 4 : a mig-29 , a russian-made jet used by both russia and syria , locked its radar on two turkish f-16s along the syria-turkey border . 
  oct. 5 : turkey and nato warned russia over the airspace violations . 
  russia 's ambassador to turkey said the incident was a mistake , according to turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu . 
  turkey ordered its military to intercept future violators `` even if it 's a flying bird , '' he said , according to afp . 
  oct. 16 : turkish jets shot down an unidentified russian-made drone that entered turkish airspace . 
  the aircraft was shot down `` in lines with the rules of engagement , '' according to a statement by the turkish military . 
  the russian defense ministry issued a statement saying all russian aircraft returned safely or were `` functioning normally . '' russia denied ownership of the downed drone , davutoglu said . 
  nov. 20 : turkey summoned russian ambassador andrei karlov to turkey to protest russia 's bombing of turkmen villages in northern syria , adjacent to the turkish border . 
  it would have had more money if russia didnt attack it . 
  whuda thunk that countries in war have economic problems ? 
  so no threat for turkish stream, 
  cyprus is not a nato ally . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_non-nato_ally the only allies in the area btw are israel , afghanistan and jordan . 
  serb flair too ud think they would know more about nato since they get so triggered about it now he keeps pushing the ` nato ally ' bs when it is not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_non-nato_ally, 
   crimea was and is russian , it 's hardly stealing , just correcting a historic mistake . 
  thats why you support an illegal annexation ? 
  because its ` just correcting a mistake ' ? 
  where are you from ? 
  they would if they could i guess there was some plan to get gas from slovakia but it didnt work iirc, 
  maybe they are - philes then, 
  context russia said on tuesday it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine and threatened to halt coal deliveries , ratcheting up a dispute over a power blackout in crimea at a time when a ceasefire between kiev and separatist rebels is fraying . 
  so russia steals part of ukraine country , cant give the region what it needs and now tries to blackmail ukraine to give support .
