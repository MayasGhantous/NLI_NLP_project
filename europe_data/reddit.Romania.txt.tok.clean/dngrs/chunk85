  how perverse !, 
  russia obviously doesnt know that, 
  yep you may be right our economy is really stupid i remember reading that we even dont have cooking oil factories anymore ( or not enough of them ) . 
  hungary buys our seeds , makes the oil and then we buy it . 
  guess who makes more money . 
  yep turkey called his bluff with his stupid moves . 
  now he just raises stakes because putin stronk . 
  cant admit he fucked up . 
   every country does that . 
  prove me how ie romania does that, 
   russia ca n't afford war with turkey , and vice versa . 
  ie because of turkish stream, 
   a lot of the eastern european nato countries are really russophobic and you may want to change the term russophobic phobias are irrational by definition and i can give you reasons why reactions are not like that, 
   we just miss china . 
  apparently they sent military advisers https://www.rt.com/news/316705-china-syria-isis-fight/ they might go in with warplanes too http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/610286/china-preparing-to-team-up-with-russia-in-syria-boost-for-putin-in-battle-against-isis, 
   redditors are experts on everything including you, 
  after 2012 rules of engagement were changed http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/26/turkey-changing-rules-of-engagement-after-syria-incident/ turkey is changing its military rules of engagement and will now treat any military approach from syria as a threat, 
   and russia 's syrian allies include hezbollah !, 
  but but i was told russia is against terrorists !, 
  they ignored turkish warnings so they got what was coming to them here are the previous incidents of airspace violations and how turkey , nato and russia responded : oct. 3 : one russian fighter plane crossed into turkish airspace near yayladagi . 
  it was escorted out of turkey by two turkish f-16s . 
  oct. 4 : russian fighter aircraft entered turkish airspace in the same region , over the hatay province , again ignoring repeated turkish warnings , according to nato . 
  oct. 4 : a mig-29 , a russian-made jet used by both russia and syria , locked its radar on two turkish f-16s along the syria-turkey border . 
  oct. 5 : turkey and nato warned russia over the airspace violations . 
  russia 's ambassador to turkey said the incident was a mistake , according to turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu . 
  turkey ordered its military to intercept future violators `` even if it 's a flying bird , '' he said , according to afp . 
  oct. 16 : turkish jets shot down an unidentified russian-made drone that entered turkish airspace . 
  the aircraft was shot down `` in lines with the rules of engagement , '' according to a statement by the turkish military . 
  the russian defense ministry issued a statement saying all russian aircraft returned safely or were `` functioning normally . '' russia denied ownership of the downed drone , davutoglu said . 
  nov. 20 : turkey summoned russian ambassador andrei karlov to turkey to protest russia 's bombing of turkmen villages in northern syria , adjacent to the turkish border . 
  putin gambled . 
  putin failed . 
  lol, 
   they were stomping terrorists into the ground . 
  the plane that was taken down was actually bombing rebels . 
  not isis . 
  russia is focused mainly on bombing rebels , not isis . 
  reminds me of our socialdems last year btw the chinese visited parliament and all eu flags were removed and replaced with china 's, 
  this could be great pr for putin . 
  see russia is hero of antiterrorism ( willfully ignore the support of hamas and hezbollah ) and now it pretends it is a victim ( for doing something it was repeatedly and rightfully warned against but ignore this too / btw bombing rebels , not isis ) so there is great propaganda potential there is another use , this could create more incoherence and fragmentation in nato depending on reactions . 
  this while there seems to be less and less foreign support for turkey . 
   one of so many people who should not have died he was in a warzone what to expect ? 
  not a civilian too unlike say the ones in mh17, 
   the money people abroad send home helps the economy it 's even worth more than foreign investments, 
  very few something like 95 or 98 % of the people dont have private insurance, 
  i remember russia claiming there are no russian soldiers in ukraine too, 
  hopefully this messes up the turkish stream plan, 
   for what reason i have absolutely no idea to appear aggressive . 
  russia stronk , the big bear . 
  this image helps the western enablers to say ` hey dont poke the russian bear or we get ww3 , just bend over and let it do what it wants ', 
   turkey invokes nato help need unanimous decision of members hmm if turkey asks help ( this is a very minor event btw even with no deads so highly unlikely ) it could be a test for nato 's crediblity . 
  putin definitely wants that and maybe erdogan also wants to play this game . 
  they can go to eastern ukraine then, 
  so far it seems like very small, 
  and that will show how much they care about relations with turkey ( ie the gas pipes project ), 
  russia has been harassing airspaces of many countries . 
  now this happens which is likely what they wanted . 
  now what ? 
  also iirc russia has been warned against this by turkey, 
   we wo n't get sold by the west once again already slowly happening, 
  france , germany , italy , hungary , czechia , austria , greece and some others have strong russian lobby, 
  they should have worked on getting in nato if they wanting right to veto but at least they have friends in nato to work for russian interests like france, 
  in romania its timi\u015foreana, 
  51 % while in most years after 1989 we had the left in power, 
   isis gives russia the perfect opportunity to get the west off of its back over what it did and does in ukraine . 
  more than that russia gets rewards . 
  new gas stream , apparently free trade deals , eu turns it 's back on eastern partnership countries . 
  it 's likely the sanctions get lifted next january . 
  i hope so, 
  weird this story isnt in romanian media :|, 
   that we have to cooperate with them the thing is we seem to be doing this on their terms cooperating = / = bending over europe 's enemy is someone else but it funds and supports euroskeptic parties . 
  how does that make any sense ? 
   seems like juncker is soloing it . 
  or pushing german ostpolitik, 
  juncker reminds me of palpatine, 
  you 'll find post history of some users that appear on this sub 's terrorism/refugee threads on / r/whiterights a recent example i noticed https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t72ll/we_are_monitoring_every_muslim_after_paris/cx4590t https://www.reddit.com/r/whiterights/comments/3sqcrk/leftists_have_taken_to_twitter_to_defend_islam/cwzm0ni the usual users like that tho are flairless , mainly posting on worldnews but recently got attracted to this sub . 
  i suspect they are mainly americans tho they have comments in which they say they want to ` protect * our * europe to pretend otherwise there may be some trolls too like this 3 day old account that just copypastes comments in different subs . 
  he posts mainly on the same issue if you notice . 
  he 's on this sub too fighting the cultural marxists or something . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3t4sof/this_video_has_made_my_life_significantly_more/cx33g66 https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3t4w9f/husband_writes_defiant_tribute_to_his_wife_killed/cx34c9s https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3t4omo/you_wont_have_my_hate_paris_terror_victims/cx33wzi, 
  they are very aware it 's still their ostpolitik, 
  not really outmaneuvered he just has simpathisers in high places of power in the west who are good at pretending to be disturbed while they actually have plans with him, 
   but he does n't have much in terms of powers , all it takes is for germany , uk and france to say no to whatever he tries to pass he 's probably talking about trade with approval or actually being pushed by germany/france, 
  wtf he gets to keep crimea ( and likely a frozen conflict in the east ) and he even gets rewards, 
  higher spending is needed even for basic stuff the army is in very weak state, 
  yep, 
  i wonder if juncker 's ec would have agreed to that deficit if it was for something that russia didnt care about or was in it 's interest, 
  no it should not btw lets invent 3 speed europe now, 
  psyops, 
  so which * state * is funding isis ? 
  states not some random rich middleeastern prince, 
   i think isis is useful in `` uniting '' europe more like breaking it apart more and more because of the rise of nationalist parties, 
  wild wild east, 
  it 's funny how often longes and other users get caught with bullshit they just keep going anyway, 
  rogozin said no anyway, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato%e2%80%93russia_relations#suggestions_of_russia_joining_nato under the clinton administration , there was a debate on whether , and on what terms , russia could become a member of the alliance . 
  ' [ 13 ] russian leadership , however , made it clear russia did not plan to join the alliance , preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level now . 
  in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
   after years of peaceful coexistence transnistria ?
