  somebody is butthurt maybe the downvoter likes the politicians who have responsability in this case, 
  the thing is a builder for that club said the owner didnt want fireproof foam because it was expensive the club still didnt have permits problem anyway there are hardly any clubs here that respect the rules , iirc even some hospitals dont have it all right ( fire in a maternity ward because of that a few years ago burning babies ), 
  no judging on eastern partnership and russia policies ? 
  especially regarding the war and frozen zones , annexation, 
  so sweden will join all nato smaller organisation except nato proper ? 
  crimea was separatism . . tho the way it was done is disagreeable this was only war to handicap kiev, 
  @ the gay euronazis, 
  and europe is likely to lift sanctions next january meanwhile http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/jean-claude-juncker-tells-eu-to-treat-russia-decently-1.2386157 juncker singing straight rt line of thinking, 
  the only person to quit so far has been some kind of smaller chief from state tv because it ignored the club event friday night when it happened ( because it looks bad for those in power ) the mayor who gave that club a permit has no problems at all from investigators neither the police chiefs who inspected the club a week ago, 
  apparently they didnt have permit for that and cops inspected them a week earlier, 
   romanians tend to think that only here measures are taken only after a tragedy takes place we didnt take any measures yet just some inspections and that when clubs are all closed ( mainly to avoid the inspections i suspect ), 
  that claudiu petre was left in front of the club even though he was in bad condition and later died because the ambulances were full meanwhile private ambulances offered support but were rejected by authorities weird thing the band was playing ( band members dead now too ) a song ` the day we die ', 
  hmm neither are we til, 
  yeah and we would be having war here like ukraine , georgia and moldova had if it wasnt for enlargement, 
  he tried some whatabout america and failed you will often see this in negative stories about russia, 
  another club burned last night, 
  afaik our ministry rejected german and french help, 
  29 dead or 30 and the number could double, 
  or the new pakistan, 
  ok this is bullshit i have to delete, 
  yeah i did think it was too much, 
  this current news is besides that statement , newer . 
  search for something from today pls, 
  1 $ o.o i want 5, 
  this is news from today there is that statement too which is yesterdays news, 
  there might be some help from israeli , french , german medics apparently we refused help from germans and french . . because we are stupid, 
  meaning germany wants some more negotiating and uses the secrecy bs to pressure, 
  im a bit surprised we dont try to appease the chinese . 
   the `` russia is no longer a threat '' crowd was very dominant . 
  now they say the same things about china , ignoring the fact it does have territorial ambitions . 
  btw the eu 's weakness on dealing with the crimea annexation and other frozen conflicts encourages chinese irredentism . 
   what about china 's neighbors that are totally against the artificial islands ? 
  they dont matter to people like him it 's the same line of thinking i see with russia and the neighbours, 
  we 're too hardcore, 
  nevermind i confused something media was saying it was a jamming system when it was a screening one ( faraday ), 
  digi headline : witness says 500, 
  i wan na see who voted how pls, 
  they like germany because it is strong enough to influence neighbours but close enough ideologically and it is militarily much weaker, 
  lol orban complains about lack of democracy, 
  he really is special, 
  no problem . 
  next year we have 3 % gdp deficit and even more in 2017 because of higher spending on other things . 
  our target deficit is 1.8, 
  btw public investment is half of what it was in 2012 . 
  we really are investing less and less . 
  that while we have and had good 3 % growth . 
  in 2014 we spent less than even in the crisis years, 
  romanians think foreign companies are evil so we dont need infrastructure, 
  iirc it wasnt actually a faraday cage, 
  i guess we keep the surplus to cover the tax cuts and raised spending on public wages and other benefits, 
  150 injured in the capital and authorities are thinking to move some to other cities since there ist enough room . 
  wtf do we do if a big earthquake hits ? 
  we spend a fuckton of money on some kind of megachurch when we already have lots of them and not on hospitals . 
  it is evens like this that show how badly romania is run how stupid can you be to allow fireworks in closed underground spaces like that ? 
  there was a check done by some authorities on that club a week ago and apparently it was all fine, 
  didnt he get some from gaddafi too ? 
  some kind of punishment for some failure ? 
  cant expect otherwise when world leaders are so weak just look at junckers last comments on russia, 
  russian tourist agency, 
  the reverse maidan, 
  so im guessing this is done to put pressure on voters to vote more with the prorussian parties * or else * ? 
  also lines of ottoman , russian empires work, 
  and the annexation isnt really contested because germanys minsk deal includes nothing about it, 
  could it turn into a fidesz-jobbik situation then ? 
  v4 coherent policies and stabilising regions ? 
  you didnt see how weak it is on the russia-ukraine issue ? 
  the main police union sides with the minister saying the scandal is some kind of plot ` that cops should remember good things done bt the minister and they should stay quiet , nobody forced the cop to do his job in the motorcade . 
  2 smaller unions are now critical of this one, 
  police union chiefs tried to blame the officer for just doing his job our ministers use motorcade for no good reasons ( this time it was going to or from a restaurant i think , he also uses them to visit relatives , monasteries etc ) and the day after the death the government gave an emergency ordinance to change the law favorably for oprea ( pm 's godfather btw ) but it 's just for the future the event happened tuesday and only 5mins ago did the minister make comments most of the media ignored the protests the pm was annoyed by the press for asking him questions on the issue oprea ` s party said soros is behind the protests , boogeyman bullshit . 
  ask the crooked lawmakers, 
  iirc in cluj but i think in bucharest too singing in romanian, 
  military courts are very dubious btw there was something in the supreme courts report a few months ago saying they should be dismantled because of some bias and lack on independence suspicions, 
  some people still with much power were scared by the mineriad case progress, 
  we should have done the same it toured here too recently, 
  yeah its more like a reverse maidan, 
  yeah like lifting sanctions and trade deals for russia, 
  again the nuclear war propaganda, 
  no old bmws ? 
  im sure he is pretty high in polls but i dont trust state pollsters, 
  wtf apparently the guy was in the socialist party when he was younger, 
   it was probably helped ( though we do n't know how much ) by the west . 
  more likely by russia, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyh%c3%a4-h%c3%a4kki_national_park https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_old-growth_forests#eurasia, 
  we even have someone like the ec president taking russia 's side, 
  meanwhile not a peep from the west ? 
  same with the recent abkhazia news, 
  well russia thinks moscow is the 3rd rome,

   he 's being indicted by the supreme court prosecution . 
  it 's the 2nd highest tier court btw the anticorr agency belongs to the highest one but this case isnt really for them, 
  great day  time for some beers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad the one in his file is the first one tho he has responsability for others too btw last sunday there were elections in iliescu 's party ( social dem where he is honorary president ) and new vicepresidents were voted and iliescu isnt anymore and the leadership said they want to separate themselves from communism ( which is bullshit but its interesting ), 
   december 1989 : revolution in romania . 
  ceau\u0219escu is killed , ex-communist iliescu seizes power with the help of the national salvation front ( fsn in romanian ) . 
  from many points of view fsn is the successor to the communist party , just with a more moderate philosophy . 
  2nd rank commies doing a coup to not allow proper revolution i hope something gets done in the revolution file too . 
  its not a proxy when there is also direct and open involvement ( ie the bombings ), 
  june elections 25 %, 
  big homeo, 
  its similar logic with keeping assad, 
  they get lifted early 2016,
