  it ca n't be banned then , not for them and at that time ( it 's recent enough to be relevant ) anyway . 
  results are based on face-to-face interviews with 2,000 adults , aged 15 and older , conducted april 22-june 9 , 2014 , in russia . 
  something something gipsy, 
  looks good to me, 
   turkey ( secular state is it really ? 
  and anyway i do n't see why it should really be a factor i mean there 's the vatican, 
  gallup has it 's own poll and it still shows putin is very much appreciated http://www.gallup.com/poll/173597/russian-approval-putin-soars-highest-level-years.aspx results are based on face-to-face interviews with 2,000 adults , aged 15 and older , conducted ** april 22-june 9 , 2014 , in russia . 
  **  you can still hate us , we do n't care . 
  what does hate have to do with this ? 
  and it 's your own fault in the first place anyway * we * ? 
  i bet at least the politicians would love that, 
  nay, 
  do they get a say in this ? 
   and it should stay that way instead of blaming the russian citizens . 
  bs he got their votes and is still very popular they are very much part of all this, 
   crimea and eastern ukraine have onshore oil deposits with some commercial use but more significantly there are major offshore oil deposits in the black sea . 
  we won in court some of that a few years ago i wonder if there will be conflict over it, 
  3 things disturb me 1 the putler appeasers ( it 's disguised as antiamericanism ) 2 is that the tactic russia uses in ukraine might be used even in nato countries and it could bypass article 5 3 the support he gives to the far right and separatists all over europe ( with minor exceptions like here where even our far right does n't like russia which is probably why it 's so weak . . it means they do n't want it 's help ) he plans to drag us all back to the 20th century and it 's difficult to deal with because geting an enemy would be perfect for the regime, 
  yeah , i think so too . 
  interesting comment history there, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3owbpkjbfza ww1 song about going past the carpathians towards transylvania ( ardeal ), 
  that would be cool, 
  i 'm sure orban would . 
  and i have some doubts also about others that would probably still put business interests before this . 
   even without nato involved it would take them more than two weeks . 
  russian army is n't that strong as they would like to be perceived . 
  not that strong compared to who ? 
   upvotes to ~ ~ left ~ ~ the far right of my name, 
  45 % seems a bit low  a state-run pollster revealed this probably is n't very reliable then this helps explain their siege mentality, 
  what is he saying ? 
   former senior communist and kgb members will also be affected . 
  never too late for that zhuravsky is lucky he was n't lynched or something, 
  here 's something weird from the newest member https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdihwgcdjtc nsfw btw / r/balkanmusic, 
  turkey wanting ? 
  i thought the government and the people do n't want this . 
  they informed the ec and did n't wait for replies prices were supposed to go up 3 % in october and elections are in a month and a half, 
   romania 's former president ion iliescu is among those investigated for the events in june 1990 . he 's the one who called the miners iirc the case has been opened and closed many times people protested because new regime meant communists were still in power so it all looked a bit more like a coup than a revolution, 
  elections are coming soon both here and in moldova this dumb pm is helping the communists there gain more votes and his words were that he wants to `` make the 2nd greater romania union 100 years after 1918 '' it 's interesting that russia is disturbed by this, 
  well i wonder who sponsors lega nord anyawy we should reward it with more energy deals instead , right ? 
  it 's the typical siege mentality of people like him, 
  with all the fearmongering on this subject i 'm not surprised you feel that way, 
   that 's the figure i remember reading when the pipeline opened . 
  nothing going through it yet btw, 
  by the time we 'd finish building the infrastucture , we 'd have high enough production . 
  we 're supposed to export much more by the next decade . 
  why do techdirt posts have that red circle thing ? 
  iirc they want some oil or gas too ( same with bulgaria , hungary , now ukraine has some interest too ) but there are technical problems, 
  putler troll account ? 
  old , rural , religious people lean more towards sd, 
  but most of the muslims here have been in this area for centuries http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_romania they 've had many grandkids already and still no jihad, 
  it was the nwo lizard jews that want to bring ww3, 
  and it 's russia who is insane . 
  just check out this site a bit .

  you should move your articles over on / r/conspiracy, 
  france, 
  arms ? 
  now ? 
  is n't it very late ? 
  how many of the current team are those ? 
  did they pick the best ? 
  it can become a rival especially if it 's tied much to russia, 
  btw ` bataia e rupt\u0103 din rai ' meaning the beating is brought from heaven, 
  thanks, 
   absolutely nothing bs it 's russia 's main goal to make it as hard as possible for ukraine to move towards western structures this is proof it succeeded at least temproarily . 
  that 's the point of the whole conflict in the first place, 
  anybody mind telling me how dubbing is n't stupid ? 
  it 's much easier to manipulate because then ukraine will still have plenty of prorussians there . 
  probably more than before the conflict and that will surely affect kiev 's policies . 
  geting them out means they ca n't do shit anymore to kiev . 
  he thinks that after a while they will go back towards moscow again so it 's in his interest to make them have as many problems as possible annexing more is n't so smart for russia because it already has economic problems and those regions are a money drain ( it is better to drain kiev 's budget instead ) . 
  at least crimea is smaller and has lots of gas ( we might get in conflict because some of the gas in that area is ours too ) . 
  btw [ this ex general of the communist secret service ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_mihai_pacepa ) said , relating to this subject , that corina is a spy for the russians http://mobile.wnd.com/2013/08/dark-side-of-colin-powells-blonde-romanian-friend/ back when [ iliescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu ) was president there were rumours about her fucking him :d same rumours now with another [ blonde , elena udrea , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elena_udrea ) and the current president i 'm very surprised that she got such a top post . 
  i think it 's only because of the stupid gender quota that this happened . 
  his cousin giovani looks like a crook too http://sptfm.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/giovani-becali.jpg he was a football agent and is also in jail, 
  food stuffs i guess meat dairy, 
  you think the trade pact made them immune to fsb or something ? 
  so . . no eu for turkey and it looks like they do n't care about nato either they 're definitely going ottoman, 
  but maybe from belarus or ukraine since they are close, 
  this is for 12 . 
  09 maybe they have n't given data yet pm said our stored gas is enough for 6 months and i think our production is enough at least for household users no freezing this winter here, 
  adrian severin ? 
  / r/geopolitics will like this / r/energy too u should xpost, 
  i do n't think about that and most of the stuff we buy is from the eu, 
  and he does n't have kids, 
  russia is n't the only one using cyrillic script . 
  renault builds dacia somewhere near moscow http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renault_russia, 
  got audio here http://www.forvo.com/word/dacia/, 
  no http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_kosovo#positions_taken_by_sovereign_entities i wonder how it will respond !, 
  yeah i too imagine that the more or less euish organisations in other regions will join together eventually . 
   the intelligent ones would love to move towards europe i 'd bet it would make it easier for politicians there to rule if they had free movement with the eu, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gigi_becali ( antigay , antisemite , violent especially verbally / once had the guys who stole a car of his kidnapped , crooked , xenophobic , apparently very religious guy , currently in jail like some of his cousins for football stuff ) he was a liberal deputy ( and in the justice commission ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_vadim_tudor ( some kind of ultra ~ ~ nationalist ~ ~ populist much like becali . . they were enemies once but now they are friends . 
  again ) he was once close to become president iirc they rarely actually went to bruxelles and iirc becali had people vote in his place . 
  in general , our mps rarely go to parliament especially to the local one . 
  they also very often vote for days off . 
  becali went to 37 out of 137 meetings so he got ~ 90k euros for under 40 days of work which is a record in the ep . 
  he did n't like it there because there were 10 euros plastic tables and 3 euros chairs .
