  they expire in 2016 http://news.yahoo.com/eu-extend-russia-sanctions-january-2016-211558832.html http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/world/europe/francois-hollande-says-destabilizing-sanctions-on-russia-must-stop-now.html http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34174382, 
  ttip activists will still make up bullshit even after deal release, 
  you guys should see / r/newrussia im not sure if its some sort of funny circlejerk judging by the banner or its serious, 
  https://www.reddit.com/domain/rt.com whiterights , socialism , conspiracy , european , russia , worldnews politics , syriancivilwar ( any conflict sub where russia is involved ) subs mainly political fringe subs and a few very big ones, 
  much less than how reddit makes it look like, 
  it 's just a frozen conflict for now, 
  they hope that now their sanctions get lifted in january ( france in particular is eager to it seems ) and/or kiev pushes some political reforms favorable to the ` rebels ' . . which could bring down the government actually since it 's not something popular to do, 
  nope it is foreign aimed, 
  not really ie parts of reddit love it, 
   the two most hated people in europe source ? 
  yes, 
  russia has big military spending plans too http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-continues-massive-military-modernization-despite-economic-woes-2015-2 russia 's weapons modernization plan envisages spending 20 trillion rubles on new weapons in 2011-2020 . 
  ( ~ 700 billion $ ) for this year it already spent half the defense budget in spring, 
  smaller multiple countries are easier to manipulate than just one bigger one, 
   nobody had nuke before wwii . 
  and now you see a bigger and bigger push in nuke carrying countries against those kind of weapons, 
  also spain , italy , france and i think netherlands trade more with it than the uk does http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/country/sau/, 
  they also had some skirmishes in the 80s and they still have border issues, 
  even many americans seem to be cheerleading for that, 
  which one of you did it ? 
  tpp is probably done partly with china in mind, 
   there is going to be no superpower after us . 
  maybe a centralised eu ? 
   we 'll still be at the top . 
  and likely stay there in our lifetime, 
  greater powers , not superpowers, 
  i noticed the usual complaining here about liberals is by flairless users, 
  hitler had more hair, 
  well putin said the internet is cia made so obviously bad something fsb would be better, 
  there are even new users made just to troll with the stopttip links, 
   does the guardian operate with a slant to anti ttip ? 
  yes, 
   it would be wise to build a common intervention force we have the european gerdarmerie force ie in ukraine when unrest started ( the early phases with lower conflict ) in the east we could have sent them there but we didnt, 
   `` eu 's soft power must be matched by collective hard power and a more efficient use of our $ 210 billion yearly defence spending . '' for comparison that is 3x russia 's , ~ 2x china 's and ~ 1/3 of usa 's, 
   also , the americans may at some moment in the future decide that they are fed up with being europe 's army for free . 
  yes they could either focus more on the pacific or become more isolationist what do we do then ? 
  bend over to putin some more ? 
  i know juncker and many eu members are eager to do that, 
  https://www.rt.com/news/230283-sarkozy-crimea-russia-blamed/ and his party 's mps visited crimea after the annexation http://euromaidanpress.com/2015/07/24/who-are-the-french-mps-that-are-visiting-crimea/ legitimising the move he is a putinist just like chirac, 
   france and germany seemed to act independently . 
  and conveniently ignoring the issue of giving back crimea the only interest was to stop fighting , frozen conflicts and irredentism are good for them . 
  it reminds me of when france 's sarkozy ( who supports crimea 's annexation now btw ) mediated the georgia issue and soon after the mistral deal was signed . 
   the eu fucked up and we should own up to it . 
  but having nuland say it , as someone looking in from the outside , and so bluntly adds embarrassment on top of the failure . 
  imagine how many other officials think it but only she got caught, 
  he 's probably hiding in russia somewhere, 
   on a eu level , incredibly . 
  we barely managed to get sanctions passed , and that is the only response the eu has given . 
  also it should have been the eu to participate in the minsk deals , not france and germany alone who are far from neutral when it comes to russian interests . 
  she was right because the eu was and still is very careless on helping ukraine and the other eastern partnership countries it 's not hateful , more like really disappointed . 
  ive recently discovered a new romanian band ( based in berlin tho ) this is a jazz piece of theirs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ychpet4flc8 and this some kind of alternative rock i guess https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcagcxmihoe, 
   what 's the problem though ? 
  corruption, 
  itt triggered rightwingers, 
  it 's likely aimed at some szeklers who want autonomy elections next year and there are lots of dumb proposals, 
  36 ` socialist ' mps in power propose a law to introduce sentences of 1-3 years for those who disrespect national symbols , emblems , etc also the ruling group wants big fines for social defamation http://www.nineoclock.ro/new-draft-law-liviu-dragnea-wants-fines-up-to-ron-60000-for-social-defamation/  according to the draft law presented by social-democrat liviu dragnea , social defamation may be defined as an action or declaration by which a person is placed in a situation of inferiority based on belonging to a category of persons `` socially distinguished by one or several criteria such as genre , age , race , religion , ethnicity , mother tongue , cultural traditions , political convictions , social provenience , disabilities , non-contagious chronic diseases or hiv / aids infection . '' the political convictions bit is interesting so if you attack a crooked politicians ( the proposer dragnea is the newly elected socialdem president from last sunday and has a sentence for referendum fraud ) for something you can get fined up to 15000 euros this law is being adopted particularly fast for some reason . . and our socialdems are far from being some sort of progressive politicians, 
  ah the big jar, 
  ( where 's the crocodile ? ), 
  i dont get it . . 
  in russian propaganda the west is decadent so they add her/him/it w/e while russia is holy keeper and promoter of the true values, 
  so the proper old europeans are in most of the balkans/scandinavia, 
  it makes nationalism look stupid when you realise how mixed we actually are, 
  bulgarians and the other balkanauts just speak the wrong language, 
  yeah a lot of money is spent i remember reading that rt in 2013 had ~ 300m $ budget close to bbc 's 380m in 2011 when it was 80 in 2007, 
  homeownership info isnt wrong, 
  filthy bourgeoisie, 
  http://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_y-dna_haplogroups.shtml http://www.eupedia.com/europe/haplogroup_r1a_y-dna.shtml#distribution, 
  im not sure recognising would help get serbia in the eu but i doubt it 's really a good thing or even actually possible and kosovo geting separated properly may help as first step to joining albania ( i wonder if it 's even planned , kosovo alone is terribly weak and i dont like microstates ), 
  only if u help with crows timisoara got lots of crows there http://timpolis.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ciori.jpg, 
  well genetically magyars are quite slavic so . . yea, 
  the voters dont care either way its not something important on the public agenda, 
  even that old pagan stuff had middle eastern influence, 
  myeah then came his indictment and since then he is busy with other things the opposition is likely to give pm next year and they will probably have the same stance tho, 
  yeah the western sympathisers of it must remember our history with it before calling us puppets of neocons , warhawks and w/e when we react to russian revisionism, 
  same info in romanian media, 
  eh netanyahu is really rightwing too so they like him, 
  yes this !, 
  whenever they win they make a picture and put it on facebook never when they lose, 
  http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=94248 there was also a rumour about agreement with the president, 
  that reminds me of this http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33521553 them changing the law so they wont pay in the yukos case, 
   romania . 
  all bro countries . 
  the pm said some time ago that he wants to recognise kosovo, 
   on thursday , vucic held closed-door talks with serbia 's orthodox patriarch and then with western ambassadors . 
  the church isnt on russia 's side ? 
  thats surprising, 
  btw did germany say anything when merkel visited ? 
  i remember a visit some months back, 
  you have been banned from the internet, 
  latin blood !, 
  with white cells in adidas triangle shape, 
  people would stop to help local hot girls too because hot girls, 
  do n't be a spannah , it 's a real word !, 
  keep it real !, 
  the more restecp, 
  historical regions http://www.investliveromania.com/img%20map/romania-regions-map2.jpg in romanian circlejerk and stereotypes the southerners and easterners are more backwards from the pre1918 old kingdom https://istoriiregasite.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/unirea-principatelor-romane.jpg ( tbh there is some truth in that ), 
  why the rose then ? 
  really who goes out for a run with a rose in his hand ? 
  damn you were fast :d i thought i could beat the mods for at least some minutes, 
  i thought it 's relevant because the sub went more rightwing recently and more / r/europeans have been attracted here by the immigration issue,
