  then give up more power to bruxelles, 
  he doesnt care , his supporters have to . 
  670-710 quite close, 
   paganism is long forgotten here . 
  dunno romania still has some pagan stuff in some rituals, 
   `` islam has never been part of europe , it came to us , '' same for christianity which is middle-eastern in roots, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#foreign_fighters_in_syria_and_iraq already known, 
  and someone was proposing for beckenbauer to replace platini or blatter, 
  facts from leftwing propaganda outlets, 
  trump is very friendly towards russia too, 
   from a neo-conservative why is everything that is worried about the kremlin something neocon ? 
  it 's funny how this buzzword is thrown around the source is actually european lol, 
  for 1 greece there are lots more better stories like poland and to a point even for greece it was a boon, 
  shame !, 
  * ring ring * shame !, 
  * ring ring *, 
  little and late and all very fast so superficial, 
  romanians didnt go through 3 4 5, 
  dont forget rt, 
  well it wasnt juncker, 
   because it is the publicly stated official position . 
  source ? 
   actually , no , there will be no referendum . 
  montenegrin parliament will decide to join nato . 
  you know that how ? 
  the procedure is to have referendum tho yes technically it is parliament who acknowledges the referendum which is probably non-binding if you read the article you would see the us said it will back montenegro if popular support grows which implies referendum need, 
  yeah gorbaciov denied it, 
  why do you care ? 
  you 're not even from europe, 
   are doctors , that work in public health system , allowed to work in private clinics after work hours ? 
  i think no and it is a proposal iirc another idea is to force new graduates to stay in the country for some years and this would be against eu free movement, 
  nothing is happening to this key guy which is very suspicious http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33166383 a report by the private international investigation agency kroll , leaked by the speaker of moldova 's parliament , suggests he was the prime co-ordinator and beneficiary of a bafflingly complex web of transactions that pushed three leading banks to the verge of collapse . 
  it says loans worth $ 1bn were transferred in just two days to a series of uk - and hong kong-registered companies - companies whose ultimate owners are unknown . 
  as a result , the state was forced to step in to bail the banks out - protecting depositors but creating a hole in the public finances equivalent to an eighth of gdp . 
  he was voted mayor recently, 
  he 's for real, 
   bending over all the time is n't his go to strategy explain his many inconsistencies on war policy, 
  flower power, 
  and it has membership in nato 's pfp program neutrality is a myth, 
  they already have france and other members to work for their interests, 
  what about just applying the law which raises health spending but they keep postponing, 
  i dunno how it will pass because the high court disagrees with the ideea the ministry said we should stop using the word ` bribe ' because it 's just a well defined set of tariffs, 
  a leader of the pro-russian opposition wants to reward the cops who arrest him with a mercedes each, 
   i have never heard an admirer mention this idea beforehand . 
  no admirer ever made that comparison it comes from part of the partisan media which is very much against the dna when the pm was indicted there was an old ` journalist ' who quickly compared it all with the securitate , coups , the mineriads , all that . 
   how does a man get raped ? 
  they drug them , put something in their drink maybe ? 
   it 's going to be a real riot when people find out that bernie sanders had a real hard-on for bill clinton 's military interventions back in the 90s . 
  his voter base doesnt know that he supported the bombings then in iraq and yugoslavia because they were just toddlers back then . . or not even born yet also in 2001 , sanders did not support the vote in congress to oppose the war in afghanistan and in 2003 he supported the resolution that gave support to george w. bush in both iraq and in the larger war against terrorism he also supports drone warfare and israel 's bombings of gaza, 
  http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-survey-demographics/ almost half of survey participants are between the ages of 18 and 24 . 
  ( and it doesnt even include minors ) a vast majority of those surveyed are male ( about 80 percent across all age groups ) this demographic is very naive and it explains the bias, 
  yeah populism works great on reddit, 
  if the us is backwards then how is romania in your book ? 
  it 's mostly just reddit demographics i think and it loves to circlejerk with sanders it 's becoming like a cult remember the varoufakis craze ? 
   to be honest only really naive people are surprised that spys spy . 
  yeah one can expect this kind of stuff from every country 's spy agency, 
   putin cleaning up obamas mess very ... optimistic, 
   politicians see it as the key to transforming germany 's notion of identity away from heredity and blood to one based on civic ideals . 
      this is absolutely insane and should be completely rejected . 
  it 's working for the usa, 
   america is different , that 's why immigration worked . 
  good explanation, 
   many russians that live abroad really appreciate this type of media why make rt and other western aimed state media in many different languages if it 's aimed mainly at russian expats ? 
  russian would be enough , maybe a few more languages for the site version, 
  found an article with some tv ratings data http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/17/putin-s-propaganda-tv-lies-about-ratings.html `` in may 2013 , rt occupied 175th place out of 278 channels in great britain , or 5th place out of 8 cable news channels in the uk . '' http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-viewing-summary 0.02 share 0.17 percent of the total viewing population, 
  well lets look here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_exports out of the top 20 all are quite nasty except uk , canada , norway and maybe mexico, 
  needs some eu swastika flags, 
   many russians that live abroad really appreciate this type of media . 
  if it was just for them they wouldnt bother making networks in foreign languages  i do not think that rt is that popular among the british and germans . 
  it doesnt matter if it isnt very popular , any bit matters and money doesnt seem to be an issue ( 1-2 billion $ budget just between 2005 and 2013 ) since the budget went up much compared to last year even tho there are economic problems i 'd like to see some tv ratings ... online it seems to do very well with 2 billion views on youtube so the rt 's audience is mainly youth i guess, 
   russia 's rt targets only russian ears and minds . 
  rt is made primarily for foreign , western audience just on some parts of reddit it enjoys much credibility ( mainly on fringe , conspiracy subs and worldnews ) it has networks in uk , germany , france , spain , the us and it ( [ sputnik ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/russia-launches-global-media-to-help-fight-propaganda-war_n_6133770.html?&amp;ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000021 ) in particular ) plans to expand more there is other media for domestic purpose, 
  its not ok to have something against all russians but lots of people voted and support those in power ( ie still over 80 % approval of putin ), 
  lol we already have conspiratards here doing damage control, 
  it says something about his fan-base huh, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malaysia_airlines_flight_17#russian_media_coverage http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10977082/russian-government-edits-wikipedia-on-flight-mh17.html reminder http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/11771299/putin-rejects-dutch-plea-to-support-creation-of-mh17-tribunal.html, 
  ` alternative media ' * inserts some whatabout foxnews *, 
  it 's weird to ban other employees too, 
   others just repair something when it pops . 
  so u dont have monopoly there ? 
  we do, 
  by who ? 
  the woman who runs the media watchdog is accused in 4-5 cases herself too lol, 
  btw theres an investigation on italian electricity distributor enel too, 
   the same file accuses apa nova of buying the silence of the media . 
  through an intermediary company , apa nova `` bought the ` goodwill ' of the press which , for a period of time , did n't publish negative aspects linked to the activities of the firm from veolia group , '' wrote the agency . 
  the 4 biggest news channels they bought ( highly partisan and involved in corruption cases , some have owners in jail ), 
  you mean you want referendum just for even negotiating ? 
  nobody does that, 
  there should be a gulag for anybody that isnt against ttip , amirite ? 
   people just want a referendum but if dictator milo says we join nato it 's not like we have a choice . 
  the procedure is to have referendum first so who lied that you will join without it ? 
  i sometimes think they ( germany in particular ) do messups like this on purpose with that in mind ... 
   she does take her mandate from the 1 % . 
  edgy smart-ass , she is indirectly elected . 
  picked by meps ` the european people ' voted for, 
  so saudis and russia are on the same level, 
  also very obvious meddling in politics when elections come telling people in church who to vote with and commie secret police collaborators running the church, 
  that after some of the opposition in the party was kicked from the party like it happened with geoana and some other guys, 
  here priests are backing the antivaxxer movement promoting their bs in church and other meetings,
