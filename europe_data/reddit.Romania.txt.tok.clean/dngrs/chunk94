   the eu is not a nation , it 's an ideology . 
  an ideology that is being forced down our throats for decades people in member states voted to be part of it, 
  you guys are breaking the circlejerk boo !, 
   whereas in truth the system is so badly designed most of it is squandered on bad projects picked by bruxelles lol in truth the local officials come up with the projects i want a source on ` most of it going on bad projects ', 
  it 's interesting that rt.com doesnt have the same flair who gives these flairs ? 
  mods ? 
  so you concede that nothing good comes from russia 's involvement ? 
   why would russia would want the end of the war ? 
  yeah the war means refugees in europe and the immigration crisis is helping more radical parties ( who just so happen to be favorable to russia ) get in power, 
  yeah and i notice little difference between hollande and someone like le pen this reminds me guess how quickly the west helped putin get out of isolation after the buk and plane shooting thing 2 weeks it took for italy 's pm to fly to moscow to meet putin, 
  maybe he is skeptical of what proper spelling is, 
  busy in the merkel thread ? 
  that and because energy is such a great political weapon for them, 
   across cee , 17 % of approved acts were passed by an extraordinary procedure . 
  this was the most common method in romania , where 55 % of acts were approved using the government emergency ordinance ( geo ) last year 's report showed 62 % our pms use ~ 80 to over 100 geos a year in 2008 we had 230 uses 140 in 2011 ~ 100 last year current pm has an average of 1 every 3 days are we comparable with the weimar republic yet ? 
  just 2 days ago our government passed something bundling together 26 ordinances into one with provisions for all kinds of things from local administration to universities and the tax agency sometimes the pm passes an ordinance and later gives another one to nulify it lol the opposition asked the ombudsman to complain to the constitutional court but he wont since he sides with the government, 
  dunno but i could find that their poverty rate is 67 % world bank data from 2010 ` diagnostics and policy advice for roma inclusion in romania ' google to find the pdf link average household income for them is 101 euros / month which is half the national one, 
   some people even believe b\u00e4ckman tries to create anti-russian attitudes on purpose you mean trolling ? 
  russian officials themselves sometimes do that, 
  the finnish david icke ? 
  ah the decadent westerners meanwhile guess what kind of porn russians like best http://www.economist.com/news/international/21666114-internet-blew-porn-industrys-business-model-apart-its-response-holds-lessons hint : gay men do it, 
  they really did exagerate how they would be treated in europe this in part explains the refugees ' reactions, 
  remember to reward with a new gas stream and lifting of sanctions, 
  it is 4 days old, 
  but the eu is some kind of puppet of corporations why are they doing this ? 
  same was probably used for our president iliescu, 
  is that some kind of / r/conspiratard ? 
  / r/conspiracy there i fixed it for u, 
  something like a third of the work force actually does nothing and doesnt appear in unemployment statistics they just live off subsistence farming our agriculture sector is highly inefficient, 
  it alternates between that and / r/whiterights when it comes to immigration threads, 
  does he want the us to nuke the middle east ? 
  yeah the guy is like a soviet sleeper agent from the 70s if you look at his foreign policy ideas, 
   yes because corbyn does n't believe in the mad principle he should look at ukraine then they gave them up and later got invaded, 
   a group of drunk balkan adolescents coming home from the statium is something you should generally avoid . 
  more so than the roma . 
  hooligans from south of the danube are more dangerous than ours imo btw lol our hooligans at a recent hungary romania match started to fight each other  ) no problems with magyar hooligans who are very bad, 
  not surprising there is much crime here but not the violent kind , very rare gun shootings and things like that it 's mainly weaponless thieving going on and frauds , car crashes, 
  actually it is europe , many eu members in particular , that care very little about crimea and ukraine and are actually very supportive of russia i do not see how further centralisation like that would make them change attitude, 
   promised gorbatschow that the nato would expand a single meter eastwards gorbachev himself denied that story the interviewer asked why gorbachev did not `` insist that the promises made to you [ gorbachev ] -- particularly u.s. secretary of state james baker 's promise that nato would not expand into the east -- be legally encoded ? '' gorbachev replied : `` the topic of ` nato expansion ' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years . 
  http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer m.g. 
  : the topic of `` nato expansion '' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years . 
  i say this with full responsibility . 
  not a single eastern european country raised the issue , not even after the warsaw pact was terminated in 1991 . 
  western leaders did n't bring it up , either . 
   you too have a strong agricultural market not really we import a lot, 
   there 's no reason for russia to attacking kurds turkey doesnt like them and it would be a favor from them to erdogan those kurds are strong against assad which is an even bigger reason, 
   what 's with the downvotes ? 
  all posts and op get that because it 's about pro-russians and posts about this dont go well on our new putinist sub, 
  our state doesnt care much anymore since after the conflict earlier this year between the more ` prowestern ' parties when they didnt choose leanca to continue as pm again since then they 've been making steps back east tho it mattered that the eu dropped support too ( probably to please moscow and euroskeptics ), 
  yes them going after kurds makes them pick assad they rather keep assad than risk kurds geting their own country anyway that stance may come with other benefits see their energy deals with russia, 
  im glad we arent following this stupid trend well not yet anyway, 
   it 's not weird that they attack enemies of syria to be honest . 
  it 's weird that they act like they focus on isis but in practice they want isis to not be eliminated attacking rebels and leaving the world to pick between supporting assad and isis is the way for them to keep assad in power, 
  more gas deals with russia obviously another one of those streams  russian spokesman says `` has n't most of ` free syrian army ' joined isis ? '', 
  lol so they are arguing that the rebels they go after are just jihadists in disguise or what ? 
  would still be lots because many syrians dont like assad for good reason ( the guy is wanted ie for war crimes ) if they really go for attacking rebel areas as apparently they are then we will see more people come from those areas, 
  some whataboutism about america is my guess, 
  they dont care about that this image battle of apparently going after isis is great for them as it gives moscow much support from the many europeans in particular the growing far right concerned by the refugee crisis it would help negate the damage they got for ukraine and other messes and maybe make the moscow friendly extremist parties more votable by moderates since now putin is supposed to be saviour of europe, 
  same for the eu, 
   i do n't think russia cares a lot about that though russia not caring about losing political influence by having other countries sell energy to the eu ? 
  their whole power over the eu is based on that, 
  isnt isis already weak right now in syria ? 
  with the strongest force there being the rebels, 
  likely to israel who is very much against assad i wonder if all this has something to do also with israel 's oil and gas discovered in the last years that could be part of the alternatives to russian energy, 
  oh yes whatabout america, 
  so vukovic is equivalent to lupescu ? 
  the guys who sing that crap do look much alike :d, 
  the roots of manele are probably turkish , middle eastern not gipsy notice how you see this crap in other ex ottoman places btw ( serbia has turbofolk , bulgaria chalga ), 
  how did you live under bolsheviks when you are probably 25 years old im a westerner ? 
  hmm i guess i am, 
  deleted comments made by makla90 / r/conspiracy it 's funny that you repeat the same thing kremlin and assad said that the chemical attacks were false flags  ) im not buying the same russian lies like when it was saying its not invading ukraine the un report didnt buy that bullshit http://www.cbrneworld.com/_uploads/download_magazines/sellstrom_feb_2014_v2.pdf http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/24/syria-chemical-weapons-doubts-chlorine / http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/sarin-attack-crimes-syria-justice some desert rebels dont have knowledge to kill hundreds with chemical weapons ( and of their own troops lol ! ), 
  syrian rebels werent known to have the rockets that were used http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/syria-chemical-attack-assad the syrian government kept shelling an area where the un wanted to investigate the use of chemical weapons http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/423866/new-clashes-as-un-seeks-wmd-probe they tried to deny them that they were also attacked by snipers which also helped delay them http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=45701&amp;cr=syria&amp;cr1=#.uicefhyqe5c syria after the attacks said they will give up the chemical weapons http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/10/syria-chemical-weapons-convention_n_3901417.html so they did have them and they were destroyed last year http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/world/middleeast/syrias-chemical-arsenal-fully-destroyed-us-says.html at the time of the attacks syria was not part of the chemical weapons convention which prohibits the development , production , stockpiling , transfer , and use of chemical weapons so they kept manufacturing but they still arent allowed to use them under the 1925 geneva convention which they did sign unfortunarely for assad french and british agencies estimated hundreds of tonnes of sarine , vx , yperite http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-french-intelligence-assad how convenient it is to blame american false flags before the attacks , in the same month , the syrian government troops were clearing positions between jobar and qaboun , a strip of land about 2 km away from the 21 august impact sites . 
  2km is the range of the rockets used in the attacks . 
  / http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/17/dispatches-mapping-sarin-flight-path interecepted talks between hezbollah and iran about how assad 's use of gas was an error http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10284773/syria-crisis-chemical-weapons-use-a-big-mistake-hizbollah-told-iran.html turkish army had a report saying it was the syrian 155th missile brigade and the 4th armored division who attacked and using 9k52 luna-m missiles , m600 missiles http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-state-agency-obtains-detailed-information-about-chemical-attacks-in-syria-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=53556&amp;newscatid=352, 
  here are some reasons not to he 's the reason the war started in the first place in 2011 isis became a problem there only a few years later and removing them doesnt solve the refugee crisis since many people dont like assad for very good reasons ( why the protests started in the first place and now opinion on him is even worse ... ffs he used the army and chemical weapons against civilian protesters ) how come nobody considers that syrians dont want to keep assad ? 
  during the syrian civil war , assad was personally implicated in war crimes and crimes against humanity by the united nations , and was the top of a list of individuals indicted for the greatest responsibility in war crimes for prosecution by the international criminal court . 
  in november 2014 , the prosecutor of the special tribunal for lebanon announced that evidence would be brought against assad . 
  it was reported that 200,000 political prisoners were in jail in syria for opposing the assad regime http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25189834 http://www.reuters.com/article/iduskbn0el25020140610?irpc=932 http://www.jpost.com/middle-east/special-lebanon-court-permits-prosecutor-to-bring-evidence-against-assad-in-hariri-case-381986 cant assad back down and let some other allawite replace him or something if the opposition isnt an option ? 
  notice ie on this thread most support for russia 's plan is from flairless american users part of the new wave of redditors that was attracted to this sub since the immigration crisis here, 
   i see the current borders being just fine . 
  wtf ? 
  the way borders were made in the first place after the ottoman empire ended by european colonialists is one of the main reasons for all the fuck up in the middle east, 
  the legitimate assad who used chemical weapons against the opposition ? 
  even civilians in the capital city, 
  but this kind of thread is actually healthy for the sub, 
  new wave of mainly american posters from the more right wing subs came here attracted by the immigration issue on this big sub it wasnt yet taken over by them but this is the perfect occasion also see this https://web.archive.org/web/20140125045719/http://www.stormfront.org/forum/t1018437/ the same kind of people cried about mod censorship :d now mods backed down and you see where we are, 
  who exactly in western europe ? 
  take france ie where most politicians ie from sarkozy and le pen 's parties are against us there is talk for those visas to be lifted, 
  guarantees today are much stronger, 
   i think in times of need , hungary would be one of the first countries to help us even if russia attacks you ? 
  remember orban and jobbik  we should look maybe a bit closer , maybe our neighbours - looking at you germany . 
  it should be obvious by now that they rate relations with russia above europeans in between them, 
  the black sea but really from a security pov us  uk  poland the rest i dont trust much in particular some western ones i expected more from, 
  is it you yellowcakewalk?why was your account disabled ? 
  great source / s, 
   also , is n't alcohol haram ? 
  syrians are quite secular, 
   things are much different in europe . 
  ha you have no idea how strong the church is in some parts of europe like in the east here, 
   a mosque is not just a building where muslims can go to pray , it 's a political center for the city .
