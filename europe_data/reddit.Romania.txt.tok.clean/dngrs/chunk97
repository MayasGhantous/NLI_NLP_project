  they had to kill to make their way through eastern ukraine to crimea, 
  or not, 
  what % do they all have in polls ? 
  it matters because if it 's not a principle then given the chance , some conditions , they will easily flipflop, 
  something something mongols / jk, 
  dial 1-800-putin, 
  / r/ruskimirnews https://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/58ainx/suspicious_prorussia_activity_going_on_in/ lately they have spread on / r/geopolitics, 
   if there are any russian propaganda troll factories geographically situated in bulgaria , i do n't think it changes much cheaper costs, 
  vote pru and you wont see them as so weird anymore, 
  tbf turkey was different when it joined, 
  imagine how the populists there would spin in , the ones who are growing higher in polls . 
  the romanian crooks did not yet have this kind of enviroment ready and the various sides were kinda split when the anticorruption push was made . 
  now they are working on it tho . 
  there was a local investigation for a politician 's online trolls and it appears that it pays well but they hire just a few people and a lead guy ( probably the one who invents the comments and who got paid something ~ 10x average national net wage ) . 
  i guess a few are enough cuz they just use lots of different accounts , likely replying to themselves often and it 's a full time thing . 
  i didnt mean it was entirely their fault but it does help influence influence in particular youngsters and i think the costs are low for such operations, 
   i assume anybody who would pay those trolls with money are wasting said money they trolled for brexit and brexit won, 
  he 's not dm 's owner tho his media is very similar, 
  any numbers by country ? 
  this reminds me of trump 's calls for violence what the hell is going on ? 
  because feels and the new outrage culture, 
  the educated swiss who voted for homeopathy ? 
  that bit applies more and more everywhere in the west today,

  surprise ...

  tbf a bunch of them are likely paid trolls, 
  inb4 berlusconi 's media invents new bullshit about montenegro, 
  they can always ask russian banks for money . 
  their fn buddies can help them out . 
  the only to appease would be a yalta 2.0 . 
  do you want a new yalta ? 
  and this trojan horse wants to be in the eu, 
  it didnt really need to make a show so im going with b, 
  it has little reason not to do the same things again . 
  it 's even encouraged by the fact that kremlin friendly politicians in the west could gain even more power . 
  how many gathered ? 
  there 's quite a connection . 
  i remember mps from sarkozy 's party going to crimea after the annexation and sarkozy himself backing it . 
  then there 's the relation with fn .

  c'mon , do n't complain . 
  just bend over and let them do all they want . 
  you do n't want to show russophobia , no ? 
   it seems like you have to have a vagina to be a lawyer or an accountant ever been to a lawyer uni or an accountant school ?

  when are the next elections ? 
  yup it 's all about protection from prosecutors, 
   not even wikileaks thinks there is a conection betwen trump and putin not even fsbleaks ? 
  they have a huge bias towards the kremlin, 
  you know you are lieing, 
  this does n't mean the politician will listen to experts but that 's another problem, 
  trade, 
  it 's not just them in epp like that also fidesz http://hungarianspectrum.org/2015/08/16/fidesz-and-the-horthy-regime-statue-for-the-anti-semite-balint-homan/ http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/right-wing-extremists-cultivate-horthy-cult-in-hungary-a-836526.html,

  what spying ? 
   they are owned by a company , really ? 
  oh so that 's where the piano pic is from, 
  yeah the left in ee is actually more like the alt-right, 
  huh how interesting bullshit targetting of pro-us politicians by fsbleaks, 
  no wonder trumpski is losing, 
  i bet / r/the _ donald is 90 % foreign too, 
  which one of u did this, 
  that research could likely discover something good for civilian use including the health service, 
   what about the other half ? 
  6 percent said they were strongly opposed to the crackdown, 
   that has yet to be proven harmful . 
  any details ? 
   who still have not realized that the world is not black and white they actually like to bring up nuance but only when it 's in russia 's favor, 
  lots of bullshit on reddit, 
  it 's projection, 
   though if russia were in charge he 'd change his mind yep a russian centered globalism is his aim, 
  you gon na trigger reddit with that, 
  it 's like a faux-fascist very similar but not quite there yet, 
  i guess because china does n't fund them, 
  well what a surprise populists of both extremes have a boner for putin, 
   so , try to make a treaty that the population actually wants ? 
  to please the commie belgians it would have to be one with russia instead that 's their real problem, 
  yep more and more countries are trying to apply the russian model of governance, 
  i keep seeing that site posted everywhere on reddit .

  yeah i doubt this new poland cares about eu credibility, 
  what does vitra mean lol why is the thread downvoted  ) is even / r/europe too triggered by women now ? 
  i suspect alt-right circles love it it 's basically the kremlin 's target audience now, 
  north korea tactics, 
  same in the rest of ee and yet they did n't go full retard like russia did, 
  dae think russia is really insecure about itself ? 
  i remember the comments from the putinists about the eu being eurogayfascists back when the russian-ukraine war started there are people in power who think ultra-orthodoxy is the cure to western decadent civilization, 
  wtf this bullshit is actually upvoted, 
  give it another 5-10 years,
