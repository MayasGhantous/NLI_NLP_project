  the whole alt-right plus the ones on the other extreme add in the conspiratards that 's the target audience edgelords in general, 
  yep got warned by fsb 2 years later he got his own show on rt meaning he was literally on russia 's payroll . 
  a real kremlin shill . 
  also instead of releasing info on russia , at the end of 2010 he got proposed by medvedev to get a nobel prize . 
  they bait you with something you may actually be more or less concerned about and then once you might be hooked they inject their own bs, 
  russian propaganda site, 
  what about my outrage against muh corporations tho . 
  i do n't want anything that would nuance this for me . 
  the usual suspects got triggered, 
  yep http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/middleeast/russias-brutal-bombing-of-aleppo-may-be-calculated-and-it-may-be-working.html  the strategy , more about politics than advancing the battle lines , appears to be designed to pressure rebels to ally themselves with extremists , eroding the rebels ' legitimacy ; give russia veto power over any high-level diplomacy ; and exhaust syrian civilians who might otherwise support the opposition . 
  they focus against rebels in order to end up with only isis as the alternative to assad which is their main way to get his group to win the conflict . 
  meh our migs were in bad shape , not only old . 
   thanks to the failure of our politicians and how they handled the migrant crisis and other crisis ' it 's due to a lot more than that there 's foreign state support for them too . 
  both open and covert . 
  will it be tanned orange ?

  yep the saudi royals are involved in drugs and orgies . 
  the army power pole is the wahabist one . 
  they should be glad they were n't assassinated . 
  it 's not a sweden thread without someone shoehorning it in, 
   we ca n't rely always on the americans , their interests and objectives may change with time , like , for instance , if trump gets elected . 
  we need to rely on ourselves . 
  while in europe you can have le pen and others on russia 's payroll go in power, 
  i never heard spert used, 
  db , goldman sachs , chinese state banks . 
  who else ? 
  just dial 1-800-putin for more money, 
  same thing in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54kjph/the_russian_defence_ministry_presents_evidence/d839jx2 they are n't playing with conspiracies or w/e anymore , all that are left are personal attacks . 
  i guess the usual spinning just could n't work any longer . 
  stir shit and then moan about muh russophobia, 
  more info about them here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rise_project, 
  just more russian back separatism in europe while in russia it is illegal,

  and trolls, 
  hurr durr durr ignorant easterners , muh fearmongering . 
  is the wunderwaffe still asking for no fact checking ? 
  it got downvoted so how is it representable of the sub ? 
   he did pretty much nothing to '' fight corruption '' well he did lift immunities when asked and did n't join with the anti-prosecutors camp at least in an obvious way . 
  tho he did accept someone i find kind of dubious as head of the highest court . 
  yeah there 's a lot of opposition to it . . 
   is there a global trend towards authoritarianism and against democracy ? 
  yes, 
  but but reddit muh direct democracy !, 
  iran backed hamas was caught funding isis http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4739234,00.html and an iran deal with weapons http://english.aawsat.com/2016/08/article55356308/alleged-use-iranian-arms-isis-sinai-draws-investigations it has some ties to al ` qaeda https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism#alleged_al-qaeda_ties http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/10/treasury_further_exp.php http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/02/treasury_iranian_int.php, 
  in people 's dark past cannibalism was not uncommon is it hyprocrisy today to be against that now ? 
   do they actually jail mp 's that are caught being corrupt ? 
  yes unless the mps get to vote on lifting some immunity in which case it 's usually a veto, 
  yeah but dont make the change too fast or you will go into another extreme, 
  it wasnt my pic my stuffed peppers will be done next week, 
  pastries, 
  mind = blown, 
  its a conservative source and who better than them to speak about one of their own , trump . 
  remember me what you guys think of homeopathy, 
  reminds me of this bit of mental gymnastics http://imgur.com/a/csg7r, 
  the 2nd one was much improved, 
  nope , urban . 
  meh i have a big basement to put it all and the family likes homemade stuff . 
  the only problem is finding time for this stuff :d but it does n't all get done at once like with jams when i make some in spring when there 's something in season to use for . 
  like 10 jars at a time . 
  no i mean stuff like this http://www.gustos.ro/assets/recipes_images/2012/09/24/90440/img_5616.jpg like for tomato soups and some other thicker stuff for other meals and spreading on pizza when making it, 
  yeah tho we dont eat them alone like that  toursi is a traditional appetizer ( meze ) to go with arak , rak\u0131 , ouzo , tsipouro , and rakia . 
   ajvar we have zacusca which is kinda the same but includes mushrooms and onions my favorite pickles are peppers ( a certain kind of meatier bells ) filled with red cabbage http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v0cyvrxqkt4/vgqzybmzy8i/aaaaaaaahec/zhijgf336bw/s1600/dsc05250.jpg the common ones are whole cabbages ( for sarmale , salads or stewing ) , green tomatoes , chilis , cucumbers or mixes of cucumber , tomatoes , unripe melons , carrot , red cabbage , cauliflower and other stuff . 
  the mixes are great too . 
  my small family pickles all that stuff , makes jams of many kinds , zacusca , compots , bullions and other tomato stuff every year a bit more than a hundred jars/bottles except the pickled cabbage which is in big barrels . 
  pickled fruit ? 
  cool, 
  that is terrorism, 
  guaranteed dominance of tories now,

  bullshit http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/09/17/donald-trump-continues-crusade-first-amendment/, 
  putin smiles, 
  oops, 
  as if exiters are so rational and pragmatic to understand, 
  not me, 
   no personal offence meant but it 's tickling a nerve when people talk out of their ass with high confidence about things they know little about . 
  i bet you love reddit, 
  reminds me of that japanese guy in czechia, 
  much better / s :d, 
  what is telesurtv ? 
  an illiberal eu, 
  dafuq did i read, 
  in romania it 's 540 euro and a teacher gets 300 they are shit there too, 
  all conservatives, 
  another 20 roubles, 
  iirc some of the unions side with oprea from the start others dont unions can be very dubiously friendly with politicians here, 
  whats with the downvotes ? 
  2/10 no stripes, 
   ~ ~ if ~ ~ when, 
  russia has a jihadi problem after tunisia , the country where most jihadis join from is russia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_activity_of_isil#foreign_fighters_in_iraq_and_syria http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-update-november-20-2015/ numbers straight from the state they are likely the chechens, 
  it does when your mission is to damage control in all these threads, 
  also whay exactly do they care about in sharia law ? 
  cuz in some countries its mainly for social contracts specifically like marriage laws , not the full sharia package .
