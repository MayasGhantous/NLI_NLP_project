  and i do n't even want to get started on english football hooligans . 
  but you do n't see us bashing them in international news . 
  sure we have delinquents who left romania in search of richer pockets . 
  so do all the rest of the former soviet block countries . 
  britain : oi , spain , you still want gibraltar m8 ? 
  spain : si senor , i wants it mucho !, 
  britain : well count you 're lucky stars friend . 
  you can keep it , so long as scotland never makes it into the e.u. 
  spain : say no more amigo !, 
  this is a walk in the park compared to the xenophobic and denigrating attitude that the romanian people got for years from more than just the british common folk , but also the majority of their news outlets and papers . 
  and their language is an international one , which means that british ~ ~ slander ~ ~ uncivilized remarks ( to say the least ) against romanian people ( and not only ) are being peddled across the globe so much so that people in countries that ca n't find romania on the map would want to avoid us like the plague , would never consider us as a tourist destination , would not do business online , would not hire remote etc etc etc. . . 
  it was always a thing , jutnot outspoken . 
  butnow it has been `` made legit '' by popular vote . 
  when it comes down to foreign policy the eu is the us best friend and allysince a divided europe will mean more power tu russia , china , well bric countries in general plus others . 
  which in turn means less power for the us . 
  so in the years to come , with tears in their eyes the will stab them in the back . 
  people who do n't vote indirectly support the majority decision . 
  so although it says 52 pro leave in gb ( 54 just in england ) that number is way higher by about 1 third of the population . 
  caracal ... need i say more, 
  is it an amazing fort ? 
  a sofa king amazing fort ? 
  man , at least have them lose it de facto in between elections . 
  that being said , anyone can be held accountable for what the did in between runs . 
  translation : you can do what you want for 4 years , but you know and fear the legal repercussions once your mandate is done, 
  tl&dr they just ** legalized ** a `` veto right '' on any form of ** discrimination ** or theft ( unlawful gains ) if these acts are commited thru the passing of a `` legal text '' ( passing and adopting a law ) the red bits are what changed . 
  i will focus on that . 
  art 269 , paragraph ( 4 ) the dispositions of paragraph ( 1 ) do not apply in the circumstances of adopting a law . 
  meaning --  it is legal to offer help to a offence commiter , to purger , to impede justice in any shape or way if done so by a adopting a law . 
  also , art 297 paragraph 3 states that the law does not apply in the circumstances of adopting a law . 
   meaning --  it is not in any way considered discrimination ( as defined by the e.u in the e.u book of rights ) if it was commited by adopting a legal text . 
  they can make anyone second citizens . 
  i 'm too tired now and need to get back to work . 
  can a good guy translate the whole text pls . 
  thank you very much edit 2 : we have the most useless journalists in history . 
  they keep focussing on the bit that stipulates that `` it is illegal to not do your duty as a burocrat only if you cause damages  = 200 000 ron . 
  they focus on the wrong shit . 
  totally fucking useless bums, 
  https://www.facebook.com/tananana.ro/videos/1814942848771344/?pnref=story live video feed in the romanian capital from a vantage point, 
  barcelona is the `` capital '' of its region , so that 's why . 
  same reason rotterdam is not on the list . 
  milano and torino ( turin ) fall in the same situation . 
  the swiss cities are the same as capitals on their cantones ( regions ) . 
  etc, 
  how to be a tourist while avoiding tourist traps, 
  in all honesty you just hit the nail on theh head with that one . 
  nobody could have put it better !, 
  it 's good for practice . 
  practice mining , practice long stays in low to no gravity , monitor human physiology and psychology . 
  check for mental health and exhaustion . 
  the more we experiment closer to home , the less we stand to risk and lose when we are way way way out in space . 
  and as for us , normal civilians.lots of stuff gets invented by solving space related problems . 
  i 'm sure new shit well be invented this time around . 
  also , having a common goal shared among earthlings in general , and not by nations will help build trust and unity . 
  i could go on and on . 
  perfect weather to try and act bohemian  ) ), 
  launch components from earth to the moon   ensemble components on the moon   launch deep space missions from lunar space station . 
  also , dangerous bio-chemical research . 
  mining , research in general etc. 
  and it offers kick ass practice and experience on how to live in , colonise and explore outer space, 
  no problem man , happens to me too . 
  glad you did n't take it like from some `` grammer nazi '', 
   degenerate denigrate is the word you 're looking for, 
  paris and the provinces ? 
  [ the aztec for one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_conquest_of_the_aztec_empire ), 
   so take it easy and just keep doing what you do pretty much my outlook on life . 
  however i like debates and discussions . 
  it is my favorite method of learning new things . 
  hence , this post :p, 
   a deluded rightist who thinks free speech is absolute . 
  any and all persons should be guaranteed the right to free and absolute speech . 
  that being said , being free and absolute does not make it any less accountable . 
  people should know that they can say anything they want , but that they can and will be held accountable for it . 
  the good shall be praised , and the bad shall be punished . 
  censorship is one of the most hideous and damaging ( if you factor in scale as a metric ) form of totalitarian control . 
  it is the cornerstone of totalitarian regimes . 
  the blocking of free and unimpeded debates is downright stupid , because talking about stuff , both good and bad , is how we learn from one another and how we grow as people . 
  if you think that common and even `` centralized '' politics have no bearing on culture , you are wrong . 
  the similarities by which we govern ourselves are deeply rooted in culture and tradition . 
  the inverse also works to some extent by which common governing policies lead , in time to common cultural practices . 
  honestly , because it feels good knowing that others have it rougher than you do . 
  it distracts from the hardships of day to day living that each of us face , regardless of where we are , europe ( east , west , south or north ) , north america ( canada and the us ) etc. 
  even i 'm sometimes guilty of thinking of africa in stereotypes , even though you have cities like [ nairobi for example ] ( http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/jobs/nairobi-named-top-city-to-live-in-africa/ ) amongs others . 
  so china and nk fit the bill huh ... 
  i agree . 
  but it 's also in part to associations made . 
  and i 'm not trying to stop it by force . 
  the whole idea behind this post was to educate people , and in turn , by starting a discussion , further educate myself . 
  yes , the bar is set so incredibly low that it 's not only easy to overpass , but even shatter . 
  i agree , and i always ask the foreigners ho moved to my city of iasi ( which are growing in numbers year after year ) what do they like best . 
  their answer ? 
  the like the fack that they can feel safe . 
  that they can walk around the city at any hour of the day or night and not worry about something bad happening to them . 
  honestly , we take that for granted . 
   it 's a magical place ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 like this ? 
  hell , i feel you man . 
  we had the exact same problems with both migrating hoards , and bordering empires from about the 900 's till 1989 . so yeah , 1000 years of crap i 'd say . 
  it 's kind of in our culture to be weary of `` outsiders '', 
  because historically russia has n't been considered as being europe . 
  we go back to the same thing . 
  geographically , if you stretch a line between portugal and the urals , romania , bulgaria and hungary fall more in the middle .
