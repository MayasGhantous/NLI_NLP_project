  if politics is your yard stick , then the eu is west and the rest is east . 
  choose one . 
  same as prosperity . 
  kind of hard to be motivated to work hard , and prepare , and improve farming techniques etc when the weather is nice , you do n't freeze to death , no need for firewood , nor for good food stocks when you have a permanent summer climate . 
  not as true today , but it is the main reason why southern hemisphere countries fell behind so much . 
  that and the fact that we wiped out their empires . 
  listen , it 's not that i do not agree with you ( i do ) but since i 'm romanian , i wo n't say anything more of our hungarian neighbors . 
  nothing i can say that ca n't be taken either out of context , or hurtful etc etc. 
  i agree , they are struggling now ( i 'd say more than ever ) , but it is part of their history and the way that they focus on external policy . 
  it worked for them during the austo-hungarian empire era . 
  how do you think they got the chance to elevate themselves to suck power back then . 
  by employing kid of the same tactics . 
  being difficult, 
  there 's also this nugget of wisdom . 
  obviously people , and more correctly put `` world leaders '' and influencers love to pin names and create cliques https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north%e2%80%93south_divide, 
  no it 's not . 
  the fact that people have the liberty to do stupid shit like this means that the whole idea behind europe and more correctly put , the eu is not dying . 
  what we choose to do with that freedom is something else entirely . 
   if you think of moldova and ukraine as eastern europe then romania should be as well . 
  your country is right underneath those other two in the context of what `` eastern europe '' is perceived of being , yes i do . 
  no , i do not condone the term , nor do i wish to use it . 
  but i only `` hold true '' to some degree to these countries , socio-politically and economically at least . 
  and to prove my point you need only look on the cultural conflicts and down right war that brought about the illegal annexation of crimea , and the problems with [ transnistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) in moldova . 
  so yeah , hevy russian influences and down right interference does equate to a somewhat valid definition of eastern europe . 
  it held true during the cold war , and by the same measuring stick it holds now . 
  geographical proximity , as you imply :  your country is right underneath those other two . 
  holds no power over the term . 
  east and west europe were defined as delimiters of ideology , customs and politics . 
  by those measures we are eastern europe no more . 
  nor will we ever be again , even if we have to die to prevent it . 
   the best countries in europe are the netherlands , followed by luxembourg , sweden , norway , switzerland and denmark . 
  woah there , take it easy . 
  some people might take this out of context, 
  what did you change ? 
  what does that have to do , objectively , with the idea behind accepting you child in a relationship with a different ethnic group - a fact that is very subjective - in romania people are very friendly to foreigners , to black people , asians etc etc , but are and will be reserved in welcoming them in `` the family '' . 
  two different things . 
  as a person from romania i get irked out whenever i hear people say that romania is in easter europe . 
  in all honesty , the only correct way to say it , is that romania ( and poland , and hungary and bulgaria + the baltic states ) are in eastern eu , not eastern europe . 
  honestly , the whole divide between western europe and eastern europe was created purely on ideological terms because of the iron curtain ( yay for our former russian rulers ) and the cold war . 
  it has n't been eastern europe for close to 30 years now . 
  and with the expansion of the eu , there is no more semblance or relevance to the term . 
  honestly , whenever i hear the term eastern europe i think of moldova , ukraine and russia ( till the urals ) . 
  that 's it . 
  maybe belarus also . 
  i resent the negative connotations that it implies , especially the image of `` a grey , communist dump '' that it holds . 
  geographically , romania , bulgaria and hungary are more like central europe . 
  ideologically , they are western europe . 
  hell , based on pure geography you could call the whole of europe `` western asia '' since [ it is the northwestern peninsula of the larger landmass known as eurasia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_europe ) . 
  but you do n't because the socio-political environment , the customs and the people differ o much . 
  so please , stop referring to us as eastern europe . 
  eastern eu is ok , because it is absolutely true , but not eastern europe , nor all the negative connotations it implies . 
  but that just might be my poor , uneducated and resentful opinion . 
  really ? 
  been there in august-september 2016 . 
  was staying at a quiet hotel right by la defance , and actively drove a a couple of days thru paris , on champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es , around the arc de triomphe a few times , by the luvre etc. 
  did n't seem that bad , but after you drive thru bucharest a coupleof times the rest of europe seems likea breeze . 
  however , trying to leave that city is a fucking nightmare . 
  as soon as the gps connected and i could catch a glimpse of where i need to go , i had to pass thru a fucking tunnel , no more gps . 
  did this 7 times before i had a chance to fucking leave . 
  [ papanasi ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=papanasi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=xvzyv52iiofiu4w2qlgm ), 
  been to italy much ? 
  or more so , to greece ? 
  get a older greek man from a rural area going , and he 'll sit you the fuck down , give you a small drink and talk and talk and talk and talk , about nothing, 
  dude , that sound exactly like romania . 
  down to a t. 
  first time i 've seen thatirl was back in 2012 in tirol during the cow 's transhumance process . 
  my god , those guys almost drank as much as romanians do , and all wore lederhose , like i 've seen more than 100 people wear worn out lederhose during my 5 say stay . 
  i totally agree and if you scroll up i said the same exact thing . 
  it 's more of a `` birds of a feather '' kind of thing, 
  what , no gross gut ? 
  same in romania . 
  identical actually . 
  1st sneez : sanatate - gesundheit 2nd consecutive sneez : noroc - luck/cheers 3rd consecutive sneez : chef - party, 
  from romania , it 's actually a duo for me , who were very very close friends . 
  first is mihai eminescu , romania 's greatest poet , and his magnum opus is luceafarul ( morning star ) . 
  second is ion creanga , and his best work is `` amintiri din copilarie '' ( memories from childhood ) . 
  because hungary , like italy , and soon enough romania only practice religion as a tradition , and not as a way of life like in the past . 
  this means that 2 people of the same religion ( tradition ) will not discuss much religious topics or bring it up . 
  but place a third person in the mix that is of different belief and watch how religion suddenly become very important . 
  same thing with muslim immigrants, 
  they rank the same as italy imho italy is deeply catholic , yet they love sexy shows on public television , they are very loose with their morals , and because of catholic confession , no matter what they do during the week , on sunday they can start again . 
  edit : i did n't mean to diss italy . 
  nothing wrong about being free and living unrestricted . 
  i actually admire them and their way of life , especially up in the north, 
  not my countries , but it was a pretty funny fuck up .

  this ranks way up in the top https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wspzemnaskq they had good intentions and a good message but a fucked up way to show it . 
  i think of hungary . 
  deeply christian , deeply conservative . 
  and they have a fascination with border walls meant to keep people out . 
  odd enough , i also agree with bavaria , after reading the comments and my experiences from visiting it on separate occasions . 
  if you think sweden is harsh i once met a nice couple from finland staying at the same k+k hotel as me in prague . 
  the husband was totaly exstatic of how cheap booze was at the hotel bar . 
  it was n't . 
  prices were ludicruise for me . 
  my city airport is in talks for a permanent low cost direct flight to sweden . 
  i 'm from iasi btw . 
  you are always welcome to romania just remember that the absolute best booze is homebrewed aka moonshine , which in legal in romania . 
  aged prune tuica and pear palinka are awesome like no other disteled drinks . 
  be warned , we like our spirits between 40 and 60 alcohol per volume content .
