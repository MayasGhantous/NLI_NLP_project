  although i earn ten times more than i would earn at a job , something in the back of my mind still tells me to get a job . 
  ok , part of that is that i would prefer to socialize and be in an environment with other people but financially it would be plain stupid . 
  not sure if it is mentioned in the article but the 2.5 tons of cocaine were just 60 % pure in its current form !, 
  i wonder how much more it would have been diluted until it hits the streets . 
  ok , but that was published on cotidianzilnic and was not meant to be taken seriously, 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  football but soccer was a term used by the upper class brits who did not want to associate themselves with the lower classes . 
  it is still widely used in the usa as that is how the name was imported there . 
  working class english absolutely despise that word though and i bet it was intentional they used soccer instead of football . 
  1 nationalism is insignificant : well , not insignificant but germany does well at that as do nordic countries . 
  belgium as well . 
  2 young people are active ... hmm , this is tricky ... 3 education is seen as paramount to a nation 's success mostly everywhere , finland puts an emphasis on education maybe more than others but education is valued in eastern europe as well and is seen as very important ( how the govt acts upon this - that is something else ) . 
  4 people are liberal and accepting i would add most western europe here with a mention of spain , germany and sweden . 
  5 that is not an issue . 
  hooliganism is an issue in england , wales and to a lesser extent poland and rome :p 6 look at any more developed country 7 do n't know . 
  i completely agree with your pov , i would just like to mention that hugh is spelled huge ( and it was spelled that way twice , so i felt the need to make this comment ) . 
  sorry for hijacking your thoughts, 
  article published 1st of april . 
  [ alberobello , italy ] ( http://www.alberobellotourism.com ) [ albarracin , spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albarrac%c3%adn ) [ mljet , croatia ] ( http://www.mljet.hr/?l=eng ) now they are not completely unknown , but they are often overlooked . 
  alberobello is a bit in the south , puglia is not the most touristic region of italy , albarracin is well known in spain but not that much outside and is not positioned well , no major airport next to it . 
  mljet might be more popular but it not mainland croatia . 
  this was posted before four hours earlier and is on the front page https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4n66pt/clotilde_armand_the_frenchwoman_who_wants_to/, 
  i have to say that you are the most optimistic romanian in this whole subreddit and romanians are generally optimistic . 
  hey , i like you . 
  hungary grew a lot because of eu funds . 
  per capita it receives the most ( or maybe a baltic state receives more ? ), 
  and last year was the end of a financial cycle so a lot of money was spent in order to spend the available funds . 
  now there are less funds available so investments cooled down . 
  also , the auto parts industry might play a role in it but i am not sure how much ( slovakia should have been hurt more if that is the case ) . 
  i did not say situation is all right . 
  i said gays are more welcome , have less to fear in italy compared to romania and i know both these countries well enough to make that assumption . 
  italy is not a great country to be gay in but it is 100 % better than romania ( or hungary for that matter , which has a green colour in that map ) . 
  hungary recently passed legislation overthrowing the small steps in recognizing gay relationships made by the previous ( -2010 ) government . 
  on may 1 , this year orban said `` only a man and a woman can have a family '' . 
  or that gays can do whatever they want but the state will not recognize their relationships . 
  yet hungary seems like a paradise based on that ranking and barely ranks lower than ireland where gay marriage was voted in a nationwide referendum !, 
  i question the value of this ranking in real life based on the examples given . 
  how does anything you write have to do with what i wrote ? 
  are same sex partnerships legal ( ok , since very recently ) in italy ? 
  they are !, 
  are there less incidents involving gays in italy than in romania ? 
  i tell you from sources there are . 
  is italy ranked lower than romania in this report ? 
  yes it is !, 
  for fuck 's sake , a country where civil unions are legal is placed lower than a country where recently 3.000.000 people signed to ban gay marriage through constitution , although gay partnerships are not legal , nor will they be accepted by the population in the near future . 
  while in italy , a majority of the population was in favor of the new law !, 
  source for italy legalizing civil unions : http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/italy-civil-unions-battle/482451/ source for three fucking million romanians signing a petition to restrict marriage by constitution : http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romanians-want-constitution-amendment-against-same-sex-marriages-05-24-2016 what is the value of that ranking then ? 
  and what has your comment have to do with what i wrote ? 
  and how the fuck do i slow down important legislation ? 
  enlighten me !, 
  it takes into account legislation and that is very unfriendly , even hostile . 
  however , not taking into account culture in this study makes it quite pointless . 
  placing italy under romania is silly . 
  i bet 99 % of gays feel safer/more accepted in italy than in romania , at least from a cultural pov . 
  the ranking is based on legislation , but even then , starting june 5 , same sex couples can have civil partnerships , so i do n't know how they made that mistake with italy . 
  the bottom 4 countries are correct , and in line with whatever i spoke to people ( and gays ) in the caucasus . 
  yes , in 95 % i had positive and very positive encounters with spaniards . 
  and the less positive experiences with spanish people happened in london . 
  i remember not finding once a litre for less than 1.98 in cagliari . 
  and that was only at one station as the majority of places had petrol at 2 euros a litre . 
  that was 2011 or 2012 , ca n't remember . 
  spain !, 
  they like to whine about themselves ( that feels home for me as a romanian ) but in the end they have amazing food , history , diversity and ok people . 
  plus good weather and politics that are not boring !, 
  i do n't think 4k is shit anywhere , maybe not good enough for switzerland only, 
  does n't surprise me , chereches was way too popular in baia mare . 
  craiova is in the same boat . 
  however , i think the biggest ( positive ) surprise is clotilde armand . 
  if she wins , she will make headlines !, 
  israel sells lots of military equipment to azerbaijan ... that 's why . 
  but it is a shame really . 
  it is [ this one ] ( http://santiago-compostela.net/ ) , the one which appears high in search results when searching both for the city and for the camino . 
  it is the oldest website about the camino , but i still have lots of work to do on it and also add more information about the cities the camino passes through . 
  i understand that and pilgrims are better tourists than the ones you find in benidorm/magaluf/torremolinos . 
  but there are downsides and as someone who contemplates about moving to spain next year , lack of mass tourism will play a role in choosing the place where i will raise my daughter . 
  as the owner of one of the largest websites about the camino , i am sorry for my contribution :(, 
  oh , i would take out a bit of sugar from my strawberries , they are very sweet . 
  ca n't stand the ones that i find out of season in the markets, 
  i have them in my garden next to oradea . 
  at this rate , it is almost too much hassle to pick them . 
  but they are too delicious, 
  pretty dull and without imagination . 
  urbanism and architecture is one of the things i dislike most around here . 
  this is a new housing suburb that is being built on 500 sqm plots [ in the outskirts of oradea ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@47.025465,21.9305337,3a,75y,353.69h,86.12t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s00r0opyyv6m6l465oqd0ag!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo3.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d00r0opyyv6m6l465oqd0ag%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d85.806511%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  the street view is from 2012 , since then it looks more normal , the roads have asphalt since then ( mostly , some are still under construction ) but it is this chaos where everybody builds whatever they want on their tiny plot . 
  there are better and worse cases than this but the lack of strict regulations has a very big impact on how cities look . 
  [ villages are different ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@46.942273,22.5291305,3a,75y,253.25h,74.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5gn9h0nl3e4eto4tglq_xa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) , especially if they are mountaineous or in the open plain . 
  kehl , sorry , my bad, 
  yes , happens often in sopron where many residents work in austria or lots of people working in strasbourg live in kiel , germany . 
  same with romania and insulin with nicolae paulescu but at least he is mentioned on the wikipedia page . 
  that is my second option anyway !, 
   ( and as a location independent freelancer i will actually try both ), 
  spain . 
  amazing cities , good quality of living overall , excellent weather ( not just hot and arid ) , excellent food , pleasant people , good beaches , easy language . 
  i would not pay taxes in moldova either if i could avoid it . 
  in romania often times money is mismanaged , often times part of it is lost in corrupt deals but there are institutions i respect as well that need public funding . 
  most people try to avoid paying taxes though , although slowly that might change as well with some groups . 
  but that 1 bln is so outrageous , no wonder no one is willing to let itself robbed . 
  the amount of tax evasion is inversely proportional with the trust the citizen has in the public institutions functioning . 
  burreaucracy and dealing with sour people in the institutions is what keeps me away from opening my business really .
