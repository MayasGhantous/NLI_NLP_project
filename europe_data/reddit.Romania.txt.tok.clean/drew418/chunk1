us prices do n't include vat . 
  freestyle snow-shoveling . 
  you get points for distance and for style . 
   only the people of catalonia decide about the future of their territory , no one else . 
  both technically and practically that is incorrect . 
  from your link  according to the helsinki final act of 1975 , the un , icj and international law experts , there is no contradiction between the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity , with the latter taking precedence . 
  when you hear mama merkel 's call , you dump everything and go . 
   thank fucking god i do n't live in the middle east . 
  not yet . 
  since usually these types of laws are pretty similar throughout eu , here 's how it is in romania : 1 . helping someone cross the border illegally : 2-7 years in prison 2 . same thing , but for monetary gain : 3-10 years in prison 3 . for the person crossing illegally : 6 months-3 years in prison ; 2-7 years for repeating offenders or banned persons . 
  4 . if the one crossing illegally is a victim of people trafficking then he faces no charges . 
  you mean these migrants have papers , an address , stuff that you can use to track them ? 
  because a lot of them do n't . 
  i find it a bit ridiculous that the most common statement i see from your side is that `` catalonia is not spain '' yet you want to benefit from all the treaties signed by spain . 
  it 's really simple : romania and bulgaria got the worst deal out of everyone joining the eu . 
  romanian polls show some ~ 90 % of people are against imposed quotas . 
  so that 's 4646 too many . 
  integration is not a fantasy , multiculturalism is . 
  forced integration works just fine . 
  moron says :  `` the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities , '' says article 2 of the eu treaty . 
   it is difficult to grasp how refusing to accept muslim refugees on account of their religious beliefs -- as hungary and slovakia have essentially done -- chimes with these values . 
  likewise , it is hard to see how tattooing numbers on the arms of refugees , as czech authorities did , respects human dignity , or how corralling roma communities in ghettoes ensures equality for minorities . 
  maybe he should read article 3 as well . 
   it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity , and shall ensure that europe 's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced . 
  just wait until 1 of them starts crying in front of merkel . 
  ayyy, 
  more importantly , out of the 508 million eu citizens , do even 1 % know who the hell is jean-claude juncker ? 
  they did graduate and they do n't have jobs in their field . 
  can you point out any changes in policy and what exactly will make things better * this time * ? 
   i 'll take your word for it over a un migration specialist `` un migration specialist '' has provided 0 facts for his claims . 
  known social & economic benefit from refugees ? 
  change in negative narrative ? 
  it 's increasingly negative and it will get worse . 
   he was being selectively quoted no he was n't . 
  you quoted the whole passage and it keeps it 's meaning . 
  we have an eu treaty that underlines the importance of cultural identity . 
  this man is a cancer to eu and its principles . 
  merkel , juncker and a whole bunch of imbeciles from eu claim that refugees that ran from syria into ** turkey ** and ** then payed traffickers thousands of euros ** to bring them to eu will accept staying in ** romania ** . 
  you speak as if the governments who oppose the quota did n't come forward with alternative solutions . 
  they did and the great dictator of europe ignored them . 
  america , the land of opportunities and debt . 
  it 's the youth academy for current hungarian league winners https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pusk%c3%a1s_akad%c3%a9mia_fc, 
  if it 's nice and logical , be sure to implement it !, 
  nice solutions you provided there , fucktard . 
  there are plenty of qualified , unemployed people ( especially young ) in europe that need little-to-no effort to integrate into german workforce . 
  so that argument falls . 
  whoa there , let 's not exaggerate . 
  this one did n't build any clock . 
   at least 13000 scientist and eniginiers still says it scientifically impossible . 
  as claimed by some random youtube video . 
  i downvoted you because you 're putting words in people 's mouths . 
  you 're not calling for reasonable discourse because the discourse was already reasonable . 
  the action is to close the border and only allow legal entry and asylum requests . 
  army is there to enforce that . 
  the only one mentioning radical bullshit here is you . 
  and that is especially because people like you are unable to have a reasonable , rational discussion . 
  for you , if do n't allow everyone in , it surely must mean they will all be killed . 
  same exact thing happens with mediterranean immigrants . 
  when someone suggests boats should n't get here , there 's this idiotic rhetoric showing up : `` what else can we do ? 
  kill them all ? '', 
  and it blocks any intelligent discussion . 
  people do n't agree with me ? 
  [ coming soon to theaters near you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/11xednz.jpg ), 
  you wo n't have to deal with gypsies once you stop giving them money . 
  being against whattabouts and whatifs is now right wing ? 
  what mental institution did you escape from ? 
  you 're trying way too hard . 
  it 's on their site http://www.topgear.com/videos/top-gear-tv/romanian-road-trip-part-36-series-14-episode-1, 
  triatlon !, 
  chinese `` ghost cities '' get filled up with chinese , eventually . 
  * v.v. 
  ponta has joined the server *, 
   a suggestion that europe should take refugees because of the universal declaration of human rights is met with vitriol just read that post and your suggestion was met with eu and international law . 
  if eu and international law are vitriol maybe you should n't just leave the subreddit , but also the planet . 
  `` but . . but . . you ca n't do that ... it would offend the terrorists '', 
  unless you look like you came from syria , you do n't deserve the free macaroni . 
  western europe suffers from political correctness . 
  it 's a savage , mentally impairing virus that we must keep away from e. europe at all costs . 
  equality of chances . 
  equal pay for equal work . 
  equal promotion for equal skill . 
  those are principles we need to respect and enforce here . 
  how the fuck does your stupid quota stop the migrant flow ? 
  sorry , but those are not the migrants coming to eu . 
  that 's a bad joke , i rate it 14/88, 
  no , it 's not a joke . 
  it accurately depicts the garbage , poorly sourced , biased information presented in the article . 
  i am not offended when these immigrants calls romania a shitty country . 
  by their standards ( countries with high welfare and well paying jobs ) it is a shitty country . 
  but i am offended that eu offered 6000 euro / refugee . 
  the end game is getting them to germany . 
  looked like a toyota commercial . 
  the article is stupid though . 
  so the west will face further extremism either way . 
  in case of war , i would be arrested if i refuse to join the army . 
  and so is the case for many europeans . 
  neymar ? 
  that is true , as well , but emigration from the east started right after 1989 , not in 2004 or 2007 when these countries join eu . 
  as for romanians , who are not in schengen , eu treaty only gives you the right for temporary stay . 
  you still need paperwork if you plan on staying .
