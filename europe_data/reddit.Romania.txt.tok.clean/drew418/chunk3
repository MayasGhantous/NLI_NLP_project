  quota is ~ 6400 . 
  government is now talking about kicking students out of student dorms to house merkel and juncker 's refugees . 
  40 % based on population 40 % gdp 10 % past refugee policies 10 % something else i cant remember, 
   and 1/3 is on so tight budget that even a broken washing machine is a huge problem for them . 
  1/2 here do n't have a washing machine in the first place, 
  i 'm pretty sure opening employment offices in spain , italy and greece would solve germany 's labor problem for far , far less than 10 billion . 
  you can even send a few billion my way for the brilliant idea and still come out better . 
  we should propose a gypsy quota for europe . 
  they are , after all , exiled migrants from 600 years ago . 
  you could call them refugees . 
  sweden can take 100,000 . 
  be right back , phoning my senator . 
  should n't that show up as a massive spike in this chart , in the year it was implemented ? 
  [ that 's racist !, 
   downright lies misrepresenting migrant statistics over and over again . 
  i have n't spotted any of these . 
  any examples ? 
   and they act smart, 
  problem , written in bold . 
   there is not enough europe in this union . 
   and there is not enough union in this union . 
  solution : bring more middle east and africa in this union . 
  600 euro in romania = 1000 euro in germany . 
  for more agenda pushing : http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do, 
   all scripture is inspired by god . 
  you are n't allowed to cherry pick , you filthy sinner . 
  even worse here , this crap violates our constitution . 
   no foreign populations may be displaced or colonized on the territory of the romanian state . 
  that 's why the romania is arguing for voluntary quotas . 
  which will lead to more social and political tensions in the eu , more fingerpointing and more and more evidence that eu leadership is inept . 
  muh yuropean values . 
  article 3 of the treaty on european union . 
  ** the union 's aim is to promote peace , its values and the well-being of its peoples ** . 
  the union shall offer ** its citizens ** an area of freedom , security and justice without internal frontiers , in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls , asylum , immigration and the prevention and combating of crime . 
  the union shall establish an internal market . 
  it shall work for the sustainable development of europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability , a highly competitive social market economy , aiming at full employment and social progress , and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment . 
  it shall promote scientific and technological advance . 
   it shall combat social exclusion and discrimination , and shall promote social justice and protection , equality between women and men , solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child . 
   it shall promote economic , social and territorial cohesion , and solidarity among member states . 
   ** it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity , and shall ensure that europe 's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced . 
  the union shall establish an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro . 
  in its relations with the wider world , ** the union shall uphold and promote its values and interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens . 
  ** it shall contribute to peace , security , the sustainable development of the earth , solidarity and mutual respect among peoples , free and fair trade , eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights , in particular the rights of the child , as well as to the strict observance and the development of international law , including respect for the principles of the united nations charter . 
  how many of these values are broken by importing half a million middle eastern and african muslims every year ? 
  factory workers at dacia-renault ( wages usually 50 % or 100 % higher than other factories ) average 400 euro net . 
  the little-training , low-experience jobs start at 250 euro . 
  1000 euro is closer to what an engineer with many years of experience would get . 
  that 's still a form of subsidy . 
  as with gypsies , everyone wants to integrate them , just not in their neighborhood . 
  they did n't pay thousands of euros to become farmers . 
  the point is over here `` god '' must come with some fine print attached . 
  something something secularism . 
  i do n't intend to belittle or incriminate you because what you 're feeling is humane . 
  it 's a natural reaction when presented with tragedy , but what 's natural is n't always rational or moral . 
  it 's because people like you , who fall into these moral traps way too easily , that europe has a problem . 
  the death of this child is a tragedy , but you have to blame the syrian war , not europe . 
  if today eu decides on 1,000,000 refugees , the dimension of the problem remains unchanged . 
  it would surely feed a lot of european humanitarian egos , but reality says there 's still 13,000,000 syrians directly affected by the war . 
  today there is news about civilians being attacked by isis with mustard gas and children are among those affected . 
  are those children worth less than the one in this picture simply because you did n't see them ? 
  going back to cameron 's statements : you do n't treat brain cancer with headache pills . 
  as long as germany and other eu countries keep fanfaring themselves as welcoming safe heavens , yes , that 's exactly what they must do . 
  if they can spend $ 10000-20000 a year on a refugee , then they can shell out $ 50 more for a flight . 
  the only thing wrong here is that you 're continuing to make uneducated claims . 
   they should be able to provide third-country nationals or stateless persons who are present in the territory , including at the border , in the territorial waters or in the transit zones of the member states , and who make an application for international protection , with relevant information as to where and how applications for international protection may be lodged . 
  where those persons are present in the territorial waters of a member state , they should be disembarked on land and have their applications examined in accordance with this directive . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32013l0032 based on that directive , asylum can be requested at the border and here 's some actual procedures : - italy http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/italy/asylum-procedure/general/flow-chart - france http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/france/asylum-procedure/general/flow-chart - greece http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/greece/asylum-procedure/general/flow-chart - uk http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/united-kingdom/asylum-procedure/general/flow-chart - bulgaria http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/bulgaria/asylum-procedure/general/flow-chart, 
   what is blatantly false now ? 
  your claim that they are forced to break the law . 
  it is false . 
  blatantly . 
  they have the right to claim asylum at eu border or in eu territorial waters . 
  they do n't have any right to step on eu soil without proper documents or an asylum claim . 
  ~ ~ 12.3 % ~ ~ 19.65 % according to eu parliament research service http://epthinktank.eu/2015/04/14/asylum-in-the-eu-facts-and-figures/asylum-fig-2/ more stats : http://epthinktank.eu/2015/04/14/asylum-in-the-eu-facts-and-figures/ http://epthinktank.eu/2015/04/27/irregular-immigration-in-the-eu-facts-and-figures/, 
  well , you can see now why they do n't want to come to countries like romania , where equivalised median net income is under $ 1900/year and working full time on minimum wage gets you $ 2100 net . 
  coming here is a terrible investment . 
  eu is not a federation , it 's not economically homogeneous and these immigrants are going to specific countries . 
  economy in romania and bulgaria is at the level of mexico . 
  there was very little difference between us and developed eu countries in terms of foreign born population ** at the start of this migrant wave . 
  ** http://www.oecd.org/migration/integration-indicators-2012/keyindicatorsbycountry/name,218330,en.htm, 
   because by the raw numbers the us has a far far greater issue than europe does raw numbers means looking at a problem with no context . 
  - immigrants per capita - immigrants per gdp - % foreign born population these are the kind of indicators worth looking at . 
  while these paint a much better view than raw numbers , they still offer very little info on social impact . 
  these people getting into eu are n't mexicans . 
   airplane tickets are usually cheaper than paying a human trafficker . 
  ya think ? 
  is this the us border ? 
  wow there 's a lot of oil in that water, 
  the new question seems impartial to me . 
  what was the old question ? 
  we got refused by germany lmao . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21653092  both countries must take further steps to prevent migrants abusing the system , he told germany 's spiegel news website . 
  ai n't life a bitch ? 
  - [ germany says it wo n't enforce dublin regulation for syrians ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11821822/germany-drops-eu-rules-to-allow-in-syrian-refugees.html ) ( i.e deport them to greece or italy ) - [ berlin says all syrian refugees are welcome ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylumseekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-urged-to-make-a-similar-statement-10470062.html ) - [ syrians send love letters to merkel ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/27/we-love-you-angela-merkel-becomes-an-unlikely-hero-to-syrians-online/ ) and kid is mad at hungary . 
   it looks like the entire european asylum system collapsed , with every country just forwarding the migrants to germany . 
  nobody forwarded anything . 
  these migrants had germany as their destination from the get-go . 
  i do n't know what disgusts me more : - germany treating refugees like they 're some sort of nuclear waste . 
  best bid wins the contract and gets to handle it . 
  - or the fact that these sums per refugee exceed what half of romanians make in 3 + years,
