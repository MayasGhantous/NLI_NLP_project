  hungary fence is too low ? 
  thanks . 
  i had trouble loading the front page . 
  sounds like the stuff i needed to go to eu 10 years ago . 
  as a tourist . 
  going for the french logic ? 
  if you have humanity in mind , then you should help their countries stop wars and rise from poverty , not take in immigrants and refugees . 
  yes . 
  i 'm actually a nigerian prince and i inherited a large fort ... 
   `` here in berlin , ** near my house i have a mosque ** , '' he said . 
  `` ** arabic food is near me ** . 
  my wife is muslim , wearing a veil . 
   the family 's berlin home is a recently renovated a three-room apartment , provided by german welfare authorities . 
  the apartment is located in neuk\u00f6lln , an area of berlin where some ** 40 percent of the population is of non-german origin ** . 
   this street is named sonnenallee , but ** arab people call it arab strasse ** , '' mohamad said of the large avenue , 100 feet from his front door . 
  `` ** when i go outside and everyone speaks arabic , i smile ** . 
  well , there 's your problem . 
  they moved from a muslim country to a muslim neighborhood . 
  their children will grow in a muslim neighborhood and will go to school together with other muslim children . 
  they will grow up in this little muslim bubble of germany . 
  so why do you expect everyone to become german ? 
  every time you create such a bubble , it is really hard for people to get out of it . 
  it is true for muslims , it is true for gypsies , it is true for ghetto blacks and so on . 
  enrichment factor too low . 
   uber argues it is a digital platform that connects willing drivers with customers . 
  being considered a transport service might make it subject to stricter rules on licensing , insurance and safety . 
  i can think of at least another platform that connects willing drivers with customers . 
  it 's called a taxi company . 
  uber is a taxi company that does taxi service and needs to respect taxi legislation . 
  if taxi legislation is found to be detrimental to customers and to the market , then legislation needs to be changed . 
  it 's pretty simple , actually . 
  `` western agricorporations '' already started to buy up all the farmland . 
  half of romania 's farmland is now owned by foreign entities . 
  these foreign companies get the subsidies . 
  unlike structural and cohesion funds which go to less developed economies , agriculture funds get distributed throughout the eu . 
  the biggest share of the cap fund goes to france . 
  the majority of the fund is going to 5 countries : france , uk , spain , italy and germany . 
  that 's because eu needs cheaper , more efficient and more sustainable agriculture . 
  entitled `` westerners '' are obnoxious when they claim eu funding is like giving money to a beggar . 
  if you give $ 5 to a beggar and take $ 6 back with your other hand , it really does n't count as charity . 
  i 'm curious , does uk have road tax , freeway tolls and other stuff like that ? 
  for americans : poland : $ 4.16 per gallon uk : $ 6.47 per gallon, 
  eu payments are solidarity ? 
  since fucking when ? 
  eu funds are an ** investment ** . 
  you are getting more money back than what you pay , you self-entitled shithead . 
  inb4 100 billion barrels of oil are found under those exact islands . 
  ca n't hear you over that pile of cash you prepared for this month 's energy bill . 
  sounds funny right ? 
  not that funny when you do a reality check though . 
  so what is 6 months in jail supposed to solve ? 
  mar\u0219 ? 
  [ household prices in europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:electricity_prices_for_household_consumers,_second_half_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb15.png ) [ industrial prices in europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:electricity_prices_for_industrial_consumers,_second_half_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb15.png ) a lot of these `` other taxes '' go to subsidize renewables . 
  it did . 
  almost as much as eu benefited from romania joining . 
  they pissed on the kids to assert dominance ? 
  they must 've been redditors . 
  you should do whatever best serves your interest . 
  i 'm solidary to the german people 's opinion and if they think they can take more , i support them 100 % . 
  ** together ** we can send more refugees to germany . 
  then germany should stop asking for quotas and ask for measures from hungary , serbia , greece , etc to expedite the transfer to germany of all the people who are currently struggling at those borders . 
  well , a good shotgun can shoot whatever fits in the barrel, 
  can confirm , just got a dji phantom 2, 
  everyone knows monarchs are inbred . 
  you can claim asylum at the border . 
  edit : for the people who downvoted , at least attempt to read the legislation . 
  the british media usually calls them `` asians '' but you did n't actually expect them to be lee , kim and suzuki , did you ? 
  he 's not naive , he 's got an agenda to push . 
  want to bet this maniac gets 15 years tops and gets out in 10 ? 
  still better than referring to criminal muslim immigrants as `` people of asian origin '', 
   germany is actually right in the middle if you view it per capita . 
  does n't look to be in the middle to me . 
  define `` environmentally friendly economies . '', 
  - if it 's `` improving '' countries , then yes , germany is in top 10 . 
  - if it 's actual pollution such as greenhouse gas emissions ( total and per capita ) , then it 's among the [ least environmentally friendly countries .

  answer : absolutely nothing . 
  yaman , pass the joint, 
  is there any decent counter-candidate though ? 
  unfortunately it 's true for many ngos , over multiple fields , from animal rights to privacy or environment . 
  these ngos are straying away from being objective watchdogs and now they 're just pushing their own agendas , many times through incomplete or skewed facts . 
  hardly anything looks like a true non-profit nowadays . 
  or better let them die , since they are sensationalist bastards .

  romania + $ 11.45 billion . 
  fun fact : romania 's intra-eu trade balance is - $ 7.5 billion per year . 
  i 'd say that 's a nice roi . 
  *** what will you say when your child asks : why did n't you invest in romania ?
