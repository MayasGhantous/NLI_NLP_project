   by whatever standard you can come up with , the city is 4th at best . 
  1st by [ gypsy mafia ? 
  hah , amateurs . 
  it has already started here . 
  in supermarkets prices are noticeably smaller but i guess restaurants and small businesses pocket the difference . 
  still does n't account for how big the numbers are . 
  greece asks for more money . 
  ecb/imf does n't want to give more money without guarantees that it 's not yet another dump in a black hole . 
  even if you cut their debt they 're still broke . 
  did greece not get a $ 100 billion debt cut from private creditors in early 2012 ? 
  did greece not get another $ 40 billion debt cut from official creditors in early 2013 ? 
  are all these news websites lying to me ? 
  but ... but ... but he won . 
  he transferred ikea to his foundation to avoid tax . 
  i 've seen these in the past and always thought it 's a question of time until someone gets seriously hurt . 
  here 's one that was in the news earlier this year . 
  so half of romanians should throw their passports away and go to denmark . 
  jk , they ca n't afford passports anyway . 
  custody is used whenever there 's suspicion someone could interfere with an active investigation . 
  such as a manager destroying incriminating evidence . 
  it does n't work like that here . 
  eu law is more like a guideline . 
  states still need to pass their own laws . 
  i 'm pretty sure the driver was attacked , not her . 
  do n't forget to throw away your id & passport, 
  i 've tried living in a country where austerity cut wages by 25 % and purchasing power by 60 % for state employees . 
  ** overnight ** . 
  ireland and portugal do n't know what austerity means . 
  neither did greece until ~ 2012 when the n-th austerity package hit . 
  eu/imf were stupid to give them money under the initial lax conditions and the greek government was stupid for wanting to maintain political capital instead of fixing the problem . 
  because the austerity in greece was implemented in tiny increments , instead of applying measures that actually make a difference . 
  just be aware that we have [ anti-tank infantry ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cedlzaw.jpg ), 
  many people are n't made for the military . 
  they simply do n't have what it takes to be a soldier . 
  this is not 100 years ago where strength of numbers decided everything and guerrilla warfare in europe is unlikely . 
  having a professional , well trained , well equipped regular army is a better option than conscription . 
  it ca n't be blocked if it 's budgeted for . 
  romania agreed to spend at least 2 % on defense from 2017 to 2026 . 
  also parents get an incentive not to name their children the equivalent of uhlleejsha or d'brickashaw, 
  send snail mail dated last sunday then blame the post office . 
  the illegals there should be in a prison or on a boat/plane/train / car trip to out-of-fucking-europe . 
  why the hell do they always show steam cooling towers when discussing pollution ? 
  then you should start seeing war as unavoidable . 
  and you 're just sitting in your sheltered environment , shitting on their graves . 
  too bad they died before passing on some decent education . 
  shame on you . 
  romanian pm declared his support in eu parliament , national parliament and spoke with the press about it . 
  i would count that as a `` yes . '', 
  what a garbage website . 
  if you start a `` who 's got it worse '' debate against romania you will lose miserably so do n't go there . 
  it is more reasonable to argue that greeks want to maintain their living standard . 
  not a long time ago someone complained that poles , romanians and bulgarians are ruining britain/germany , etc. 
  yes , it is logical to leave them in a war zone . 
  sure , data for 2014 : http://frontex.europa.eu/news/frontex-publishes-annual-risk-analysis-2015-la1x1g 74 % adult males 11 % women 15 % children go read the full report . 
  it 's even worse for the mediterranean immigrants . 
  over the land route , more syrians bring their family along compared to africans coming over the sea route . 
  luckily , there are [ starter guides ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ) exactly for this . 
  i think you found all of them . 
  luckily , hungary 's border is n't over 3000 km long . 
  [ this is a funny looking coastline . 
  what do the colors represent ? 
  start a map business ? 
  i do n't get your point . 
  if germany 's debt was due tomorrow , then yes germany would default . 
  but it 's not , it spreads over 10-20 , maybe even 30 years . 
  as long as you can pay your installments it means you can pay the debt . 
  their country can pay it . 
  umm . . http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=sort, 
  hey that was ... like 2 full years ago so it does n't count . 
  well , if eu would have eyes to notice that bulgaria and hungary already got a number of refugees that surpasses 50x the retarded quota pushed by germany and italy , maybe we would n't have all this crap going on about how eastern europe does n't want to cooperate . 
  [ i see no difference . 
  do you ? 
  you racist ? 
  what the fuck are borders for ? 
  sounds stupid . 
  this happens for most major engineering projects in any industry . 
  the funding & technology needs to come from different sources over multiple years and that 's how stuff gets messy . 
  pretty sure every european country has it . 
  also law allows use of `` reasonable '' violence when stopping a crime . 
  i think the only deluded group here is on the other side , the one you belong to . 
  police does n't do anything to gypsies caught when stealing . 
  a trip to local police station and a fine they will never pay is n't justice . 
  next day they are back to stealing . 
  it 's also not a coincidence that it 's mostly women and children . 
  they do it intentionally because they 're harder to prosecute . 
  eu should block this until the details are made public . 
  as far as the average hungarian is concerned , their govt are signing a blank cheque to russia . 
  remember we live in a world where this [ 2000 year old statue ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/artemis_met_museum.jpg ) is worth the same as [ this piece of shit . 
  ] ( http://www.moma.org/collection_images/resized/831/w500h420/cri_149831.jpg ), 
  romanian counting : 1 , 2 , 3 , ... 98 , 99 , 1000000, 
  i hope romania delays eurozone entry until cash is either completely fazed out or ecb decides to stop being retarded and goes for polymer money . 
  paper money sucks balls . 
  did you guys get backup generators this time ? 
  reminds me of a scrap metal grinder . 
  * triggered *, 
   or destroy his crops . 
  i can just imagine some bearded tards jumping over fences and pulling carrots out of the ground , stomping on flowers and shaking trees , all while yelling allahu ackbar . 
  75 % of minimum wage + 0-10 % of last year 's monthly average . 
  so currently it starts at $ 165 and there 's no upper limit . 
  self-lashing for 70 years does that,
