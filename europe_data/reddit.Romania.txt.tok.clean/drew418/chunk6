   and having almost 2 million in a country of 20 million . 
  source for almost 2 million ? 
  small reminder that nigeria has 180 million people , most of them under 18 , and 50 % of the country is muslim , so it 's a gigantic recruiting ground . 
  damn we must change our word for '' [ match fixing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/match_fixing_in_romanian_football ) '' now . 
  wtf i paid $ 120 to get a massage like that . 
  that 's the biggest problem i have . 
  in all these pictures there are 95 % young males . 
  in every boat there are 1-2 women , 1-2 children and everyone else is 20-30 year old males . 
  compare that to photos of real refugees fleeing from isis in syria and iraq where you 'll see an equal mix of men , women , children and elders, 
  geography has ** most ** to do with it . 
  first of all , there 's natural resources . 
  then there 's actual localization , neighboring countries , available trade routes , etc. 
  lots of geographical factors . 
  the disparity between western and eastern europe did n't appear yesterday or 25 years ago , it can be tracked back to hundreds of years ago .

  do n't worry , the environmentalist nuts managed to scare everyone away from here . 
  in us there was a scandal with tax dodging by companies in ireland , puerto rico and other `` tax heavens '' . 
  for apple & microsoft effective tax rate was claimed to be under 3 % . 
  this is one of those articles http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1026577.shtml apple 2 % tax rate http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0521/451564-apple-tax-arrangements/, 
  yes . 
  money is only spent on eu approved projects . 
  if there are n't enough valid projects , they wo n't be able to spend the money . 
  this is for 2013 . 
  croatia has access to $ 8.6 bn in 2014-2020, 
  admittedly poland took the hardest hits in ww2 but still , it looks like the polish commie rule was the worst among other shitty commie govts . 
  chat disabled ? 
  what the hell ? 
  do n't they know chat is 10x more entertaining than the show ? 
  too bad agriculture is one of the least productive sectors of economy . 
  if agriculture is a high portion of gdp then you 're dealing with a rudimentary economy ( think sub-saharian africa level ) . 
  even in a highly industrialized country like france , ( eu 's biggest agricultural producer ) , gdp per hour worked in agriculture is significantly under manufacturing & services . 
  do i need to mention that oil industry is at the opposite end of the chart ? 
  why does it take so long to count ? 
  old people , low education , rural , lower class vote socialist-democrats young people , higher education , urban , lower middle class and above , vote liberal democrats usually between these there is a 2:1 ratio, 
  that 's what it takes . 
  the it market is not easily predictable and americans are succeeding because they are throwing money at every idea . 
  on top of offering you the data plan you are paying for , the isp signs deals with various content providers to give you free stuff , like un-metered facebook , whatsapp , etc. 
  sometimes , they can offer these services even without a data plan , 100 % free . 
  you do n't pay for internet , you still get facebook , youtube , etc. 
  with net neutrality , that is illegal , because it 's considered `` positive discrimination . '', 
  here 's an article on what happened in chile with net neutrality , which banned free access to several content providers , including wikipedia .

  you ca n't get to transnistria without going over ukraine . 
  the problem is when neutrality bans free stuff . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  since when does simply existing give a company the right for premium service ? 
  are all companies entitled to equal tv ad time ? 
  are all companies entitled to show up on the front page in a newspaper ? 
  what the hell does a free market have to do with informed purchases ? 
  i think you are confusing a couple of things . 
  free market means prices are ** regulated by supply and demand ** , not by a central authority . 
  advertising , manipulation , etc. 
  all affect supply and demand . 
  it 's not unfair as long as you get what you pay for . 
  it 's a principle that holds true for all economy sectors . 
  go check netherlands ' net neutrality law . 
  there 's absolutely nothing wrong with data package deals like the one you mentioned . 
  the fact that spotify gets a `` fast lane '' ( in this case more data ) does n't affect your standard package . 
  the data you payed for does n't get restricted in any way for other services . 
  this is no different than , let 's say , cable tv , where you pay extra for hbo . 
  fast lanes are n't inherently bad and they can be legit business if they are implemented like these free data packages . 
  the problem is that isps throttled other services instead of providing additional bandwidth for the fast lane . 
  ** edit : wow , people sure are poorly informed around here . 
  why do n't you guys check netherlands ' net neutrality law and see what it says ? 
  you are proving you are short-minded and did n't even bother to check the source . 
  bodies did drop . 
  that almost makes it sound like it was a peaceful annexation , does n't it ? 
   the soviet ultimatum demanded that the romanian troops evacuate the territory of bessarabia and northern bukovina in four days , beginning on june 28 . 
  [ ... ]  the soviet party accepted a one-day extension of the evacuation -- until the july 3 , 1940 , at 2 p.m. , moscow time . 
   yet , as early as the night of june 27/28 , 1940 , without waiting for the romanian response , the soviet troops crossed the border at five points . 
  on june 28 , 1940 , the romanian cities of cernau\u0163i , hotin , b\u0103l\u0163i , ** chi\u015fin\u0103u ** , and cetatea alb\u0103 were already under soviet occupation .

  hitler and stalin did what most nato members would n't do today : they started an aggression campaign together . 
  from  european territory to  libya  west africa is quite a stretch you seem to be really confused . 
  i had a sudden urge to stop scrolling when i got to latvia .

  if you think about it , you actually expect jihad in every gif on / r/unexpectedjihad mind = blown , right ? 
  did n't orban back down on this as soon as he found out he has no support ? 
  it seems to me barroso is beating a dead horse . 
   there is no genuine reason to abstain from hallal or kosher products , unless you are simply xenophobic/bigoted . 
  [ til sikhs , hindus and christians are xenophobic/bigoted ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kutha_meat ) oh the poor muslims and jews , the only ones allowed to have religious choices . 
  there have been so many summer storms lately in romania i thought this was about [ actual rainbows ] ( http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/gq/20150504/93/14034179253069819741.jpg ),

  i missed the part where us/canada/australia indiscriminately allow immigrants in their countries . 
  last time i checked , the australians were diverting boats to other areas and the us had taken in ** 2700 ** syrian refugees ( per capita it 's 400 times less than sweden ), 
  how do you fit them into `` society of all groups '' without saying `` fuck you '' to some of your own citizens ? 
  there is no such thing as a country made exclusively out of rich people .
