  businesses and banks store digital money , not cash so that 's why cash is just 3 % of the world 's money . 
  what maters to a cash-free system are ** transactions ** made by normal people . 
  here are some percentages :  in the eu , card payments represented 16.5 % of all transactions in 2013  in europe , 23 % of electronic payments were made using smartphones or tablets in the second quarter of 2014 http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mastercardrevisedpdf.pdf, 
  cash-free is not possible using credit cards alone . 
  it 's just too inconvenient to handle daily small transactions . 
  split a bill ? 
  need a small amount of money really fast ? 
  give money to your kid ? 
  the only way to manage any of those without cash is to make the transaction go through a smartphone and a payment processor . 
  what about the accessibility and reliability of the payment system ? 
  you do n't need a license or a contract or anything to carry cash , but you need them to go cash-free . 
  how many things do you rely on when making an electronic transfer to someone ? 
  you rely on your device , the 3rd party app , their device , their 3rd party app , your bank , their bank , etc. 
  if any of these or the connections between them fail , your whole transaction fails . 
  cash exchange is pretty damn straightforward . 
  * honestly , whenever i hear people say they have n't used cash in ages , i think to myself they must be pretty anti-social . 
  i 'm pretty sure that would be `` her heart , her virginity and * your * wallet '', 
  there 's no decent chrome alternative for firegestures , which made my browsing experience 10x better . 
  i fail to see how forcing your shitty belief onto others can be acceptable . 
  yeah but replacing it with shipping containers does n't count as trying . 
  did you ever sign a real mass petition ? 
  you know , the one where you sign with an ink pen in a table after you give out your full name , identity number and you validate it with an id ? 
  because that 's the only kind of mass petition worth a shit . 
  there are many ways to make your voice heard : contact your representatives , both on national and eu level , personally or through ngos , contact your ombudsman , etc. 
  `` signing '' ( '' `` s because this is not a real fucking signature ) a useless piece of crap is n't one of them . 
  some of the most powerful it companies in the world backed net neutrality : microsoft , google , facebook , amazon , netflix , ebay , yahoo , etc. 
  you can say that the shitty internet petition did it but you would be lying to yourself . 
  laws changed by internet petitions :, 
  blame russia for that . 
  which part of it ? 
  the one with beheadings ? 
  or the one with oil , ferraris , asian maids and beheadings ? 
  stealing/begging in sweden is a better life than stealing/begging in romania . 
  not really . 
  we meet the criteria needed to start the erm ii process ( currency pegged to euro ) but we keep postponing it . 
  the newest schedule says 2017 for that and 2019 for eurozone . 
  it can happen but it also can be changed again . 
   the united states is scheduled to take in its largest tranche of syrian refugees to date -- up to 2,000 by the fall of this year , compared with a total of about 700 since the civil war in syria began four years ago , according to the state department . 
  it seems like us cherry picks the oil , nuclear and rocket engineers . 
  why the fuck are feelings and faith grouped up ? 
   they have suspended shops even if they had less than $ 1 that was unaccounted for . 
  the tax reform process is at risk simply because you uneducated idiots help propagating bullshit stories like that one . 
  the same thing happens in the anti-corruption fight , where the criminals try to sway public opinion in their favor . 
  this might be shocking news to you , but ** when thieves get caught they tend to lie . 
  well technically speaking , in a nuclear transmutation reaction the atoms at the start are different from the atoms at the end . 
  roaming is calling from abroad and the other one is just international calls . 
  church bells rang saturday at 6 am . 
  and by `` bells '' i mean loudspeakers . 
  i told you to go to the most reliable source , independent of the politically biased media cesspools from romania : the european commission . 
  by mentioning b\u0103sescu you pretty much blew any bit of credibility you had . 
  ** should a murderer be free until a conviction is made ? 
  ** the justice system must make sure the accused does n't commit more crime and does n't interfere with the justice process . 
  politicians like ** dan \u0218ova ** are accused that they destroyed hard-drives and files from lawyer firms which could have potentially been evidence of fraud . 
  that 's the reason they 're placed under arrest . 
  also , dna does n't decide who goes to jail and who does n't . 
  that 's up to a judge . 
  i suggest you stop listening to the media that 's financed by convicted criminals and check out some european commission reports about dna . 
  no , it does n't happen in romania . 
  it 's illegal to be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged . 
  you then have to appear before a judge who can give an extension for 72 hours if he concludes that evidence for a charge could be gathered . 
  i had a guinness about 2 years ago so we 're basically family . 
  this is discrimination . 
  plain and simple . 
  regardless if the intent is good or not , that 's what it is . 
  explosions due to gas leaks are n't common . 
  last year i had to install a gas sensor with a solenoid valve as it became mandatory . 
  if it happens it 's usually some idiot 's fault with improvised boiler or stove . 
  a classic joke about soviet reporting : ** question to radio yerevan : ** `` is it correct that grigori grigorievich grigoriev won a luxury car at the all-union championship in moscow ? '' ** radio yerevan answered : ** `` in principle , yes . 
  but first of all it was not grigori grigorievich grigoriev , but vassili vassilievich vassiliev ; second , it was not at the all-union championship in moscow , but at a collective farm sports festival in smolensk ; third , it was not a car , but a bicycle ; and fourth he did n't win it , but rather it was stolen from him . '', 
  romania 5k net nominal 10k net ppp half of that for debutants . 
  useful advice, 
  every single time people have been prosecuted for piracy over here , it was because they attempted to make money off the pirated stuff . 
  either this is the first arrest for `` file sharing '' or the media does n't share the whole story . 
   ** romania ** the positive action programme for roma in higher education continue . 
  these mainstreamed programmes offer dedicated places for roma for admission to public universities ( in the academic year 2010/11 , 555 places have been granted , and in 201\u00a02/13 , 564 places ) they do n't even bother to mention highschool education , where gypsies have 13,000 guaranteed places ( 2 in every class ) . 
  it must feel great for the average romanian kid to be rejected from a good highschool with a score of 90 % while gypsies get in with 70 % . 
  even better for universities . 
  this immature knobhead does n't deserve so much attention . 
  the kid obviously never stepped out of his neighborhood and his view on the world might be a bit skewed if he only experienced it on the internet . 
  small dick syndrome, 
  can confirm , had kebab today . 
  lithuania had its currency pegged to eur so the value would have dropped anyway . 
  just crimea parade preparations . 
  who the fuck wears reindeer horns in march and why ? 
  a map of france with the german flag on it, 
  did you ever go to get an abortion and got refused ? 
  from wikipedia :  galicia ( spain ) - the area now called galicia was first inhabited by humans during the middle paleolithic period , and it takes its name from the gallaeci , the celtic peoples living north of the douro river during the last millennium bc , in a region largely coincidental with that of the iron age local castro culture . 
  and  galicia ( eastern europe ) - galicia or halychyna is a historical and geographic region in eastern europe , once a small kingdom , that currently straddles the border between poland and ukraine . 
  the area , which is named after the medieval city of halych , was first mentioned in hungarian historical chronicles in the year 1206 as galici\u00e6 . 
  huh til . 
  translation : russia did n't offer me enough money yet . 
  johannis is as minoritarian as it gets in romania : - he is from an ethnic group which makes up 0.2 % of the population - he is n't an eastern orthodox - he does n't have kids - his name does n't end in '' - escu '' - he likes tennis more than football obviously , every single one of these facts has been paraded against him by the opposition , with stupid claims such as `` he will sell the country to the germans '' or `` how can he lead a country if he does n't know how to raise a child ? '', 
  also , [ the scumbag religious leadership ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qgrkzjg.jpg ) allied with the other guy and started running massive propaganda in churches . 
  i can definitely say that the `` guilt '' votes were non-existent . 
  he won because - the german minority has a positive image in romania - he had a nice track record as a mayor - he seemed serious compared to the other clowns in politics - the other candidate was ( and still is ) [ a fucking moron .

  [ r\u00e2\u0219nov ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s8qv69y.jpg ) is a fortress and does n't have a castle . 
  i think it 's disgusting that there still are intolerant people around us so i hope they ** really ** build it , to promote tolerance and multicultural values . 
  and then across the street build a gay bar and a steakhouse specialized in pork named muhammad 's .
