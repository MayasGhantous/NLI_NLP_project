  [ this shitface ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cw3vppa.jpg ) is the ceo of vodafone romania ( main carriers in ro are orange and vodafone ) . 
  recently , he has whined that romania has '' ** too much competition ** '' on the telecom market ( apparently 4 carriers is too much ) and that '' ** prices are too low ** '' to be sustainable . 
  so this asshole asked for official measures to `` heal the market . '', 
  what 's the problem with his claims ? 
  the problem is that vodafone ro has been ripping of its customers ever since it got into the romanian market in 2005 , with yearly net profits of over 20 % . 
  it 's among the most profitable companies in romania , together with the other main telecom carrier . 
  first year in business ? 
  2008-2009 crysis ? 
  for years , vodafone and orange have been best friends and maintained high prices but now their oligopoly has started to fade , so fuckers like this vodafone asshole who got used to ripping off people are now clinging with their teeth on any ridiculously overpriced service they offer . 
  they 're really desperate since their profits are now dropping to `` only '' 15 % . 
   yes , that is the only armed fixed-wing aircraft in the irish air corps . 
  one could only conclude that the irish have a massive fleet of variable-wing aircraft . 
  germany , austria and switzerland . 
  +20 km/h for license suspension ? 
  that sounds really low . 
  `` we raped some folks '', 
  if that was in romania the contract would 've been won by a garage company with a single employee that 's 90 year old , for the best offer of 3 billion . 
  8 % faked documents means you got 80,000 people with unknown identities with a big chunk of that coming from warzones . 
  good luck , germany . 
  `` ok who farted ? '', 
  it seems you want to reach a time where eu can bully everyone around without asking for permission . 
  border control with a majority of votes and no veto right is just as toxic as the mandatory refugee quota . 
  both are de facto attacks on sovereignty . 
  forced relocations and border control of romania was something not even the soviet union dared to do after 1958 . 
  soviet union 2.0, 
  * normal * people still dismiss turkey 's accession but i 'm warning you : eu bureaucrats are dead serious about it . 
  merkel and her cronies are dangerous and must be taken serious . 
  regardless of the stance of these protesters , there * should * be a referendum for such important matters . 
  hopefully nothing here, 
  on a scale from 1 to 10 , how desperate is the opposition right now ? 
  hey , 2-3 are honest people , it 's not nice to generalize just because of the other 500 . 
  remember guys , the right-wingers are fearmongers and populists !, 
  the mandatory quota is also to blame . 
  before the quota got shoved down our throat , a significant amount of population ( ~ 40 % , if i remember correctly ) , including myself , supported setting a voluntary quota , based on available capacity . 
  after the quota i want none of it . 
  ok , let 's play your game . 
  if you 're not a `` muslimhugger who wants to flood the eu with third world refugees '' , what party is your option ? 
   they support fracking and coal . 
  beneficial for their citizens  they are strictly nationalistic and want to impose insane restrictions on foreigners working . 
  beneficial for their citizens  they oppose refugees but they also support cutting aid . 
  beneficial for their citizens . 
  this week the black box of the jet was recovered and sent for analysis . 
  this is a curious moment for turkey to be back-pedaling . 
  * cough * [ nord stream ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream ) * cough *, 
  there is a tool we can use to change mindsets . 
  it 's called prison . 
  ban it or live with it . 
  2 extremely simple choices . 
  which is good ... maybe they 'll let some civilians flee instead of getting them into cages on rooftops . 
  unequal access to education ? 
  fuuuuck you . 
  romania is the only country in europe that has free education with an ethnic quota , all the way up to university level . 
  the most useful assets for putin to split the eu are merkel , juncker , schulz , etc. 
  it feels like every article about turkey from the past century has the same fucking photo of davutoglu . 
  so are there any estimates on how many actually entered germany ? 
  they are stabbing everyone who does n't seem to be palestinian , so even arabs and actual palestinians can be victims . 
  [ they also killed a 76 year old american peace activist ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/94593cd9595545f6889cb0316202593d/israeli-dies-wounds-oct-13-jerusalem-attack ), 
  so by default 2 men is the best possible pairing . 
  is that what you 're saying , erdogay ? 
   where is this group of people who actually believe that these crimes should n't be prosecuted and investigated based on cultural differences ? 
  in universities , teaching social studies . 
  i wonder if there are any studies on this matter and what 's the most prevalent case ? 
  - the kid who lost and went on to be a reject and a loser - the kid who lost and did n't care - the kid who lost and progressed to get better and more successful . 
  because as a kid i competed in track & field and i would bet my life on the fact that ** kids do n't fucking care about losing ** and this `` everybody is a winner '' bullshit is about the parents being self-entitled assholes . 
  yes , it should be a contender , because hezbollah and iran are the lesser evil by far and yet they are considered the enemy of the west and saudi arabia and the gulf states - the allies . 
  not saying there should be a friendly attitude towards hezbollah , but for fuck 's sake , the relation with salafis must be reconsidered urgently . 
  11,744 honor cases in 5 years for uk . 
  data shows reporting rate is very low . 
  you live in an alternate universe . 
  if the us does n't want war then it should n't invade other countries , especially ones on the other side of the planet . 
  it was the us who armed talibans against russia , it was the us who invaded afghanistan and left behind a mess , it was the us who made the same in iraq , syria , lybia . 
  your former military officers now understand that dictators in the middle east were the best solution for its tribal demography . 
  ** but for some reason the us does n't want to stop screwing up . 
  most likely he did n't migrate . 
  can we ban links from the economist , please ? 
  you can beat someone with a tire iron perfectly fine . 
   the benefits of giving a new home to the refugees will clearly start to outweigh the costs `` within the next five to 10 years '' . 
  should not apply if someone is hurt by common sense . 
  rip ever 13,820,000,000 bce - 2002 we hardly knew ye, 
  it has been confirmed that russian wheat strengthens isis . 
  based on my very limited knowledge on the subject , wheat also stores better than flour . 
  i remember my grandparents storing wheat for 1 + year and milling flour every 1-2 months . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  china rightfully owned and controlled the islands in the past . 
  that is not under debate , that is a historical fact and it is enough to give legitimacy to their claim . 
  the question is who owns them now ? 
  and ownership is decided strictly on history and politics , not on location . 
  the fact that the islands are 150 km away from the philippines and 1000 km away from china is ** absolutely irrelevant . 
  ** what matters is who controlled these islands in the past and what treaties have been signed . 
  sea borders are defined based on land border . 
  whoever owns an island also owns the water around it . 
  read the document from here : https://www.dur.ac.uk/ibru/publications/view/?id=232 you can skip to chapter 8 for the conclusions . 
  i am forced to reiterate this . 
  you can check my other comments in this thread for clarification : unclos decides maritime borders based on land sovereignty , not the other way around . 
  china claims the islands in scs and according to unclos if you own the island , you also get the water around it . 
  italy ca n't make any historical claims because the borders in europe are already defined under international law ( italy itself being signatory of them ) ignorance can be funny at times , but the amount of redditors in this thread that are disconnected from reality is concerning . 
  i suggest you educate yourself on the matter . 
  there are 6 countries that under international law have legitimate claims in the area . 
  china 's claim has absolutely nothing to do with geographic position of the islands .
