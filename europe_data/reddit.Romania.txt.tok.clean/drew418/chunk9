  it 's funny that a country that did n't exist until 250 years ago , from a continent that was unknown to civilization at the time china had control over these islands can have any claims in the area .

  i just want to point out that being 3000km away from mainland china or being `` literally on the beaches of malaysia '' does n't mean the chinese claim is n't legitimate . 
  the chinese are n't creating any islands , they are expanding the natural ones , paracels and spratly . 
  they have been officially claiming that area since 1876 . 
  it 's the media who calls them `` artificial islands '' . 
  if australia could ban chris brown from entering , you can do it too , norway !, 
  yep , the current government is a disaster . 
  3 consecutive years with surplus and almost none of it will go into investments . 
  it will be used to promote some more populism . 
  state-subsidized cheap labour . 
  the subsidy circumvents eu regulations too . 
  pretty smart . 
  because of a shitty legal system that keeps prisoners for 10 + years in jail before execution . 
  one more time : you are confusing `` legal '' with `` democratic '' . 
  democracy = citizens being ** actively ** involved in decisions concerning their state . 
  national policies agreed upon `` in advance , '' with no mechanism in place to dispute them , are incompatible with democracy . 
  eu was built with the premise and promise of respecting national identity . 
  in 2015 eu respects jack-fucking-shit . 
  95 % of polled romanians do n't want juncker 's stupid quota . 
  do not confuse `` legal '' with `` democratic . '', 
  the vote might be legal , but it sure is n't democratic . 
  you might want to read the other articles too . 
  by the way , the foundation of eu is the treaty on european union and the aims of eu are described in article 3 . 
  we do n't live in your fantasy world . 
  the eu was built on the principle of closer cooperation being beneficial to its citizens . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  that title was better , since this one is incomplete . 
  dropping charges in the eu does n't help snowden much . 
  he also needs protection from extradition . 
  that 's a bold claim, 
  apple did lobby in ireland and they even admitted . 
  they have a special tax deal , around 2 % http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0521/451564-apple-tax-arrangements/, 
  [ and for ladies ] ( http://i.imgur.com/96nlcjs.jpg ), 
  your crooked idea of free speech is kinda worthless if you 're dead . 
  prosecutors appealed the suspended sentence and asked for 10 years in prison . 
  good news from france . 
  keep it up !, 
  contact your eu representative . 
  here are the european values juncker has been babbling about for the past 2 months : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11957432/eu-should-not-harp-on-at-turkey-about-human-rights-says-jean-claude-juncker.html juncker and merkel have gone mad . 
  luckily for me , people from the important part of the bigger group do n't support terrorism as well . 
  that is the whole point of being in a bigger group . 
  as long as someone sends a message , the message will be heard , and maybe things will start moving . 
  i 'd rather believe that fellow europeans do n't want anyone to support isis . 
  as for cursing at other countries , i think that would be more characteristic of turkey , not of romania . 
  if it 's a product of basic need then it should have a low tax , regardless of who uses it . 
  if you ca n't comprehend the concept , then you 're just as stupid as that mp . 
  i do n't know about your preference , but i find it much more convenient to wake up when it 's still dark and have another hour of sun in the afternoon . 
   on the whole , we have 3 time zones in the eu and the fact that a uk company closes the workday two hours earlier than its romanian subsidiary does not seem to cause any problems . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  that is a proven fact . 
  better than the 12 million people displaced by the current war who ca n't go home because of countries like turkey keep helping isis . 
  korwin-mikke nazi salute https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnufpvw2fv4 korwin-mikke human trash immigrants https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uptbiqeow94 buonanno merkel mask ( lmao ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-trnyalki4 buonanno merkel t-shirts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7qj_rq7mxs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58dpgh4-cbi calling this `` promoted nazi ideology '' is quite dumb . 
  i am writing to romanian meps to sanction turkey . 
  i 'd say a majority of people supports people fighting the islamic state . 
  we 'll see how far democracy goes . 
   people keep insisting that the state has social responsibility , while a private company has not . 
  this is 100 % correct . 
  a company does not have inherent social responsibility . 
  responsibility comes only indirectly , if the state has put rules in place to define it . 
  the rest of your argument does not make any sense . 
  you 're putting the equal sign between state and private company , which is simply not valid . 
  players do not have the responsibilities of the referees . 
  that is the claim from the company . 
  former employees say they found out from the press , a day before . 
  wow !, 
  so you ca n't tell the difference between the state and a private company ? 
  if so , i honestly do n't even know where to start explaining . 
  i 'll try to put it in simple words : in the game of economy , the company is the player and the state is supposed to be the referee . 
  that is not what the video says . 
  vat tax on food is still flat ( no gender disparity ) and still  0 so i do n't really understand what your counter-argument is here . 
  anyone pointing out gender in this matter is borderline retarded . 
  if people would have some common sense , that dumb mp with the `` woman tax '' would be thrown out asap . 
  debate should exclusively be if said products are a basic need or not . 
  china only builds cities , sorry . 
  yes . 
  as it would be normal in capitalism . 
  pro-tip : if housing does not meet the new demand , it 's not the migrants who will be homeless . 
  if you 're a german who has a rent smaller than that and has a contract about to expire , i have bad news for you . 
  because the government pays for it , not another private company . 
  the german government just used these people 's taxes to throw them out of their job . 
  the same backstab happens when government out bids and throws out tenants to house these migrants . 
  thank you for supporting terrorism , uk . 
  their oil wo n't run out anytime soon . 
  best case scenario , oil wo n't be needed anymore . 
  children used as human shields and propaganda tools https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0cf9c8b_3m, 
  if the left wants to stay in power it should start by not screwing over its own citizens and not by demonizing the right . 
  this article is trash . 
  they sure look like educated , hard working young people with high morals . 
  i would ban all professional activism . 
  no , fucking others in the ass is a russian tradition . 
  could 've raised 5 orphans and turned them into doctors with the money spent on this lunatic . 
  an empty chair would 've been a better crysis manager . 
  so what ? 
  she probably has some nice cozy spot saved up as a backup ( like pretty much every other psychopath involved in this ) . 
  germans and europeans will foot the bill . 
  in the past years december was the month with the highest number of arrivals . 
  nazi hat ?
