  i 'm not even going to talk about the cheap skilled labor ( you know , from all the years of working in the factories ) . 
   i do n't think the eu was honestly aware of the scale of the problem , and i think what the eu meant by `` getting tough '' was really just them doing the smallest of things to actually start forcing romania to fight it . 
  that 's what we heard in romania and it 's the most common defense from people who defend this . 
   if i 'm in hospital there , i 'll need to bribe the anaesthetist if i want to wake up from emergency surgery - that 's just absurd to me . 
  yes , it is . 
  sadly , people are used to it , and it 's kind of a like a shadow private medical system , which is the worst from both systems ( worst because you have to pay and you do n't get to have contracts , guarantees and all the benefits of a written and signed deal ) . 
  the other sad truth is that medical staff and doctors are really poorly paid . 
  i have plenty of friends in the system that are honest , but they often have other people supporting them or some extra job , because it 's simply too hard otherwise . 
  the romanian governments refuse to allocate more money to the system , probably because it 's harder to skim from it . 
  you can check the stats on % invested compared to other countries . 
  my personal opinion is that there 's an interest in having the medical system become so shitty that people will accept the line that it should be dismantled and sold off . 
  that seems like the right thing to do , but i guess he 's name is now bruce hood . 
  right ? 
  robin hood and his band of merry men ? 
  i am a romanian and i agree with you . 
  romania got in the eu by the backdoor and , as you know , that 's not just bad for the eu , that 's also bad for romania , since it involved * obscure * extra costs . 
  but the general propaganda line is that romania had to join the ue * to fight * corruption , thanks to a larger regime that would insist on respecting certain rules . 
  did n't really help , it just reduced the number of competitors in the `` corruption sector '' . 
  after 1989 , the most eager to cross into europe were not the most honest of citizens , if you get what i mean . 
  it was simply interest : there was nothing worthy to steal in romania and people were poor . 
  how could crime pay in such conditions ? 
  not really . 
  mexicans immigrants seem to be willing to work and often do so in very unfair conditions . 
  that 's a pretty smart system . 
  `` mission accomplished '', 
   it 's pure cosmopolitanism . 
  only without the people actually being so cosmopolitan ; one of our great national ironies . 
  in what dictionary is it a synonym ? 
  the church is clearly an institution , while christianity is a wide term containing all of christian society , culture and apparatus . 
   and because of that it is n't really relevant how long people have had ideas because it can all change over night ( thus `` culture '' ) . 
  ah , so you 're making the naturalistic fallacy . 
  well even so , it 's not even in our nature to be violent assholes , and you see this by looking at the places where people do n't behave like that . 
   it is that homosexuality was part of our culture before religion and it will remain a part of our culture even after christianity becomes just another loony mythology in the eyes of our great \u00b3 grand children . 
  the topic was about homophobia, 
  i did n't say `` church '' , i said christianity . 
  the culture itself has these ideas embedded ... and has had it for centuries . 
  people do n't need to go to a church and hear a priest dish out hate in a low and serious tone ; they already get it from older relatives - as a tradition . 
  the church teachings have impregnated the mind of the people a long , long time ago . 
  a very old tradition of orthodox christianity . 
  well , you 're going to end up with metal detectors in a lot of places ... including cinemas . 
  those are a minority, 
   because the right to bear arms is what differentiates a free person from a slave close ... but no ; free persons are different thanks to a form of property rights . 
  slavery is pretty old , older than guns and you can read about it in history books . 
  weapons do n't guarantee freedom . 
  in the history of slavery , you 'll find plenty of cases of soldiers and warriors being slaves to an army . 
   also guns can prevent crimes ( imagine if one person on utoya had a gun except for breivik ) . 
  you 're thinking that someone would use it ... you think it 's so easy to shoot someone ... rather than prevent crime , weapons are just great stuff to steal and sell . 
  the more people keep guns , to more guns that are `` lost '' and washed up in the underground of society . 
   the criminals will get their weapons anyway . 
  which criminals ? 
  you seem to think all criminals are willing to risk the consequences of homicide . 
  and no , they wo n't get it anyway . 
  the less guns there are floating around , the harder it is to get one ; it 's just like any other commodity . 
  it would raise their price , though ( which has good and bad consequences ) . 
   also , if guns are banned , should we ban knives and other pointy things as well ? 
  or are these reasonable threats ? 
  no , but we should keep an eye out for knife-throwing courses . 
  if you really ca n't tell the difference between a gun and a knife , well , google it . 
  i do want to point out that guns are basically really good at offering the ability to kill someone with the ~ ~ push of a button ~ ~ squeezing of a trigger and good just at that ( well , maybe paper weights , but who uses those anymore ? ) . 
  a knife has many uses . 
  well , a driver 's permit should be obtained after a psychiatric exam , a regular one . 
  it should first start with the production line , and most importantly for bullets , not guns ... but such a thing would also cause panic-buying , if it was announced . 
  so when the illusion starts to fall apart ... 
  as for their ** attitude ** ( not the direct cause of shootings ) : they grow up with gun toys , gun movies , gun games and gun news . 
  it 's no surprise they care about guns . 
  and the marketing of guns is very good , because it appeals to very primitive survival instincts , and because there already are many guns , it 's easy to start an `` arms race '' on a civil level . 
  the religious presence in society and culture is so present and spread out , that people do n't even notice it ; often they do n't even know about `` the christian privilege '' . 
  being so common , people rarely stop to think or care about it . 
  you can figure out the rest . 
  it 's a very important factor . 
  it always has been ; christianity thrives on conservative cultures , so it 's very `` safe '' in the rural areas . 
  as far as i can remember from the most recent data , more than half of the population now lives in rural areas . 
  it 's not `` pristine rural '' , it 's somewhat like a sub-suburbia , so there 's still plenty of modernization going on , but it 's very superficial and only the younger generations , who have also grown up in a globalized culture , who are the most atheistic and the least culturally christian . 
  sadly , their situation does not imply a rising interest in matter of intellect , philosophy , society and so on ( who where they supposed to learn that from ? ... 
  ) , so it 's not an amazing social progress , but it 's still progress and they 're more open to learning . 
  whoops . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  i guess the tv primed me with the latest news to use that word ... hah . 
  yep . 
  the romanian territories were the last in the region to give up on feudalism and slavery , after and because of the 1848 movement . 
  the orthodox church was the last institution to give up slaves ( gypsies , rroma ) , while the region slowly , and i emphasize ** slowly ** , got out of the feudal era . 
  we 're about 50-100 years behind europe culturally . 
  you mention the serbs ; all i can say is that the orthodox church imposed the use of the old slavic/slavon language , and as it had so much wealth , it also had the means for education , which meant that they had a great deal of power over the intelligence of the society . 
  the first schools were started by them so they could train clerks and smarter priests to work in the government and church bureaucracy . 
  i mention the above because ... well ... romanians do n't speak slavonic . 
  we have many words from it , but it 's a small influence ; the alphabet is latin and so is most of the language , but the religious authorities had a problem with latin , since it was a catholic thing . 
  which resulted in a highly ignorant population who could n't tap the culture of the renascence because of the lack of latin training and books , while also being stuck with stuff written in the cyrillic alphabet , in old slavonic , which was an elitist language here , and even the elites knew little . 
  often priests were forced to use slavonic in rituals , which was funny because they did n't know it , so they ended up murmuring it by ear , which is how we end up with the monotonous tone of rites you can find today every sunday in romanian churches . 
  when that murmuring/mumbling thing happened , it was called `` boscorodi '' ... there 's actually a word for it . 
  my point is that romanians were stuck in a large and dissipated area with few connections , with ignorant folk , ignorant rulers and doubly ignorant and anti-intellectual clergy . 
  i 'd say it 's just really bad luck . 
  politically , yes ; i was thinking more about the general social and industrial infrastructure, 
  large and dissipated population ( rural ) ; isolated communities have a harder time with progress . 
  it 's to be expected , as they also have strong aversion to many other facts . 
  they actually do ; you should google `` church club conversion '' or something like that, 
  that 's why there was like twenty new churches ( buildings ) built in last century altogether . . shit , we have like 1 church / day here, 
  well , actually , no ... that mostly happened after 1990 . 
  not long enough and not secular enough ; the regime favored the large orthodox church , which made for great informants , and were asked , in return , to quash the greek-catholic cult ( a local mix of orthodox and catholic ) and give the orthodox church their churches ... 
  the catholic church were also protected . 
  a small number of religious rebels were persecuted for political reasons , but that 's about it .
