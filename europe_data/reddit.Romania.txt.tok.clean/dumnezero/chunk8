  yes , that was a funny episode , but i do n't care for insults . 
  if you actually have some sort of argument , please share . 
  no , i detest thinking in such prejudiced terms . 
  hang on , we 're not in the 19th century anymore . 
  sadly , the trend is growing for obesity and `` fast-food '' is getting more popular and mainstream . 
  even sadder , we have many people who complain about how poor fast-food is , but are under the delusion that traditional food is better ( pork and cow stuff , various cheeses , sweets and cakes ) . 
  thus , the top factors of mortality in romania are pretty relevant . 
  it 's december , so by the end of the month , the emergency services will again be overwhelmed by people who ate too much and too bad . 
  traditionally it 's food with a lot of fat and oils . 
  hungarians got their high cooking traditions by working for the austrian royal courts ... so they now have a very * rich * food culture . 
  also , our brains are naturally attracted to fat oily food , which is very rare in the wild ( some oil fruit , many seeds and , when hunting , some animal fat -- wild animals tend to be very lean ) , but it is common in our modern societies . 
  when you eat fatty or oily food ( and you can put oil in many , many foods or you can just fry foods in oil ) , the brain sends out signals to ** not stop ** , to continue to eat all the fatty food , until you actually start hurting from the increase in volume and tension on the muscles . 
  basically , if you take your clothes and boil them in oil , you 'd probably find them delicious . 
  just go to a rural area , almost any rural area except for mountain villages . 
  germany 's reunification was a good investment and a boon for it , thanks to the large number of ( cheaper ) workers from eastern germany . . 
  poland took care of its industry and encouraged a healthy local economy . 
  romania `` took care '' of its industry , like the mob movies . 
  in romania , we import about 70 % of our food ( including raw materials for food processing ) . 
  that would make the issue not just visible , but something you feel in your gut . 
  [ cluj-napoca ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jgk4j9e7oj4/ulhgk493j-i/aaaaaaaabg8/9tstzsn4jzy/s1600/dumnezero_popa_cluj_acadea1.jpg ) , officially the most atheist city in romania, 
   there are no trained restoration teams in romania . 
  there are , they are at the universities and they are angry , too . 
  it 's cheaper for local politicians to organize `` restoration '' with unskilled workers/firms . 
  the problem is , as always corruption . 
  i personally know a few restorers , one of whom actually has a stone masonry company and employs old restorers ( of course , most of them are magyar ) and they aim to train more and get into more projects . 
  they have a lot of work actually . 
  if anyone here is looking to understand what kind of moderation should be used , what orientation , well the answer is staring you in the face : ** inclusion ** . 
  that also involves , inevitably , kicking out the xenophobes and the like , since they are basically against that idea . 
  nationalism , racism and other such nonsense should have no place in a forum about continental cooperation and exchange . 
  and , yes , it is ironic that the assholes actually band together across country lines , it 's also disturbing . 
  it takes < 50 users to make a difference, 
  mobile users are the bane of modern websites, 
   an agenda i 'm sure they have apps for that now, 
  just to be clear , downvoting is also a form of censorship on reddit , since it literally hides comments from view . 
  everyone seems to like it so much ... 
  depends on what you understand by '' forced '', 
  so you 're saying you have two standards, 
  it 's mostly just us . 
  the farmers committed sacrilege against property !, 
  was it all the greece drama that brought them here ? 
  i see a some strange upvote patterns . 
  the farmers should start an online petition !, 
   declines in manufacturing employment happened in almost every other 1st world country ... because most of them adopted the same `` trickle down '' economics , it 's not a coincidence, 
  if they 're so cute , why even kill them at all ? 
   you know , there were other countries that had to impose austerity , they did it decisively and early in the crisis , now most are back to economic growth . 
  do you have a list of these countries ? 
  i 'd like to read about it, 
  stem cells , human sexuality and reproduction , stds . 
  and , of course , they deny the '' natural '' in * the theory of evolution by natural selection * , which is the most important bit . 
  no , fear is an emotion . 
  rationality implies planning , measuring risks , accounting for assets and so on . 
  if you feel fear , it is very likely that you 're being rationally impaired . 
  that does n't answer my question . 
  radicals is not a measure of `` bad '' or `` violent '' , it is a measure of how far from the main-stream someone 's worldview is . 
  fear is not a rational thing and neither is confirmation bias, 
  it would be a really bad idea for reddit to allow the / about/spam pages to be public , as a there 's plenty of spam in there and it would permit spammers to optimize their methods, 
  when people use religion as an excuse for having and making hope or for organizing charity , is it still because of * them * and not because of the religion ? 
  is that the safe word ? 
   then the produce of every consumer good was sub-par compared to western levels and therefore could n't compete with foreign imports . 
  the internal one especially . 
  exports , however , had to be better . 
   planned economy was woefully inefficient at places - so for example much of heavy industry suddenly found itself unable to compete . 
  the industry was n't designed to work at the * larger free market levels . 
  in case it 's not obvious , you can design the primary industry ( mining , refining , processing etc. ), 
  to intentionally work at a loss in order to produce cheap materials and supplies for secondary industries which are more diverse , more widespread and create more added value . 
  of course , if you take one link the chain , it 's going to look like it running poorly and was buried in debt . 
  pump and dump - for the private sector . 
  bankrupt , strip and sell - for the public sector . 
  capitalism for the many . 
  socialism for the few . 
  hungary is still ahead in many ways ... 
  i am still jelly . 
  especially regarding agriculture . 
   then the next government started reforms but got ousted for massive incompetence . 
  and since been it 's mostly been a case of `` underdog opposition '' trying to gain power and steal as much as their predecessors or more , * for justice * and all that . 
  well , it was n't that bad ... just large-scale chaos behind which natural resources , state and public capital and stuff like city housing were basically pawned off to whoever had some money or the right connections . 
  why would that be relevant to the following years of economic turmoil and recession ? 
  * caricature *, 
  except for all the alcoholism and passion for fresh cheeses . 
  in general , the rural population has a shorter lifespan . 
  the food may be better and in less copious amounts , but people in rural areas also tend to avoid seeking healthcare ( especially checkups ) or simply ca n't afford it . 
  this works for the us . 
  we do n't have so many of those in eastern europe and people still know how to cook efficiently . 
  however , certain street foods are very popular , especially pastries . 
  but fattening up is a trend , so moldova will eventually catch up , especially if it gets together with romania . 
  and eastern europe ( but we already have plenty of homophobia ), 
  i am a bit envious, 
  you should see what they did to uganda, 
  [ eating fat is linked to type 2 diabetes ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04292.x/abstract;jsessionid=be423898dda6158906de63c9c2883340.f03t02?deniedaccesscustomisedmessage=&amp;userisauthenticated=false ) [ here 's a video explaining it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-f9q_-tt68 ), 
  that 's like 90 % of baking, 
  ... ashamed it took me 4 seconds to get it, 
   by now it 's no secret that the rebellion was sparked by foreign agent provocateurs , however , real romanians rebelled for real and got shot with real bullets and got crushed by real armored transport vehicles and real tanks for real . 
  you can still see plenty of real holes made by real bullets in real buildings all over bucharest so let 's stop with the bullshit . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  also , that 's unrelated to the issue of * who * took power in the following year ( s ) . 
  elevators ? 
  think of cars !, 
  it 's about time for some reform in their banking sector . 
  nope , i leave that to pedobear . 
  it 's a joke .
