ah , the `` intelligent '' part of society , media and politicians keep their rethoric of insulting the poor/uneducated while the rift between the everyday person and the `` elites '' is getting wider and wider , and they wonder why people want change , be it extreme ? 
  who is asking ? 
  only problem is that europe got divided after the second world war , a war in which the ussr probably did aprox 60 % of the job to be honest so surely you do n't think they would have just bent over and given the west free reign over all of europe , right ? 
  they did the bulk of the job beating the nazis , they took by far the most damage so they took control over most of the territory . 
  second of all , did i miss the news when trump said that he wants to `` give '' eastern europe to russia ? 
  maybe he 'll create the washington-moscow axis ? 
  why would i worry because of russia ? 
  do you guys really think that trump will disband nato ? 
  then russia will invade the baltics like all those articles that people like to post in this forum ? 
  will they just take over half of europe without anyone saying a thing ? 
  all because trump won ?? 
  how would that in any way be beneficial to the usa ? 
  i live in eastern europe and i feel just as safe as yesterday . 
  strange , right ? 
  there is no way usa will abandon nato dude , stop spreading bullshit . 
  sure dude , keep dreaming . 
  but if it were the other way around it would have been all right , right ? 
  how can they go back to something that never changed ? 
  russia has always been a nationalistic state , whether it was during the russian empire , soviet union or modern russia . 
  of course logic applies to russia 's desire to expand ( just like any other country ) , in finland 's case the distance from st. petersburg to the border . 
  again a war-mongering article ? 
  can you guys not find something more interesting ? 
  kind of expected , as they both incline towards the same things both culturally and politically . 
  why are there so many fucking fear of war articles as of late ?? 
  we got it , you are afraid of `` big bad russia '' , no need to post such articles every goddamn day . 
  what does being 2016 have to do with anything ? 
   what is your expertise in the field that you think you 're qualified to declare it unnecessary ? 
  how come being told lies such as that we live in a racist patriarchy and that words are violence are necessary ? 
  did you even read half of those articles ? 
  it all comes together , those people commiting such things are liberals and this is what they do , they push an agenda down your throat and those courses are nothing but another way of spreading the narrative of `` opression '' . 
  why did the uni . 
  of washington consider english is `` racist '' ? 
  what kind of mentally deranged person do you have to be ? 
  all those fake crimes ? 
  this is literally the kind of stuff they teach you in such courses , that you are a very `` oppresed '' minority and the evil white cis priviledged male is the enemy . 
  it all binds together , such courses then spill into other areas and you find out that words are triggering and racist , language is misoginistic , crimes and violence are ok as long as they are against people we do n't agree with and a whole lot of mentally ill stuff is coming from the mindset that is encouraged in these courses , here is a list of some of them : http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/plymouth-student-mens-group-discrimination_uk_58dd03d7e4b05eae031d76a1 ?

   also are you trying to say russia wants to be a non-factor at the moment ? 
  what do you base this on ? 
  no , i am saying that the eu wants russia to be a non-factor no matter what cost . 
  i 'd go as far as to say that they could n't care less in what state the russian society is in as long as they are obedient ( see saudi arabia ) . 
  yep , that 's exactly what fn is going to do in spite of being a part for years and never resorting to violence to reach their goals . 
  for real dude , go outside more , clear your mind . 
  kappa for real now mate , you are either a troll or completely delusional . 
  yeah , i should n't be laughing , after all you do believe that fn is literally just as worse as the nazi party ... 
   eu for instance seems quite open about the opinions on russian politics and what direction they would like to help them move let 's be honest ; the only direction that the eu wants to move russia towards is being a non-factor , just like russia tries . 
  do you think that germany really wants to improve russia ? 
  cool story bro . 
  how come ? 
  what side of russian propaganda would you say the population is assimilating ? 
  ok mate , go on with your life then , if that 's what you really think . 
  i do n't get the outrage/surprise ? 
  it is well known that every single major country has its own propaganda machine , some do it more subtle while others do it more openly . 
  what is so surprising that russia is trying to spread pro-russian messages in europe ? 
  we ourselves do it to russia too . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  are you talking about the nazis or fn ? 
  if you really are comparing hitler 's germany to le pen that 's very fucking dishonest and disrespectful towards all of the victims of nazism . 
  in your mind , all populist/right win parties are the same ? 
  revisionist history , i like it : extract from wikipedia :  from beer hall melee to beer hall coup d'\u00c9tat : the abortive beer hall putsch and the ensuing trial in 1922 and early 1923 , hitler formed two organizations that would grow to have huge significance . 
  the first was the jungsturm and jugendbund , which would later become the hitler youth . 
  the other was the stabswache , an early incarnation of what would later become the schutzstaffel ( ss ) . 
  inspired by benito mussolini 's march on rome hitler decided that a coup d'\u00e9tat was the proper strategy to seize control of the country . 
  in may 1923 , elements loyal to hitler within the army helped the sa to procure a barracks and its weaponry , but the order to march never came . 
   a pivotal moment came when hitler led the beer hall putsch , an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat on 8 -- 9 november 1923 . 
  sixteen nsdap members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup . 
  hitler was arrested on 11 november 1923 . 
  [ 29 ] hitler was put on trial for high treason , gaining great public attention . 
  [ 30 ]  the rather spectacular trial began in february 1924 . 
  hitler endeavored to turn the tables and put democracy and the weimar republic on trial as traitors to the german people . 
  hitler was convicted and on 1 april sentenced to five years ' imprisonment at landsberg prison . 
  hitler received friendly treatment from the guards ; he had a room with a view of the river , wore a tie , regular visitors to his chambers , was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary . 
  the bavarian supreme court issued a pardon and he was released from jail on 20 december 1924 , against the state prosecutor 's objections . 
  as you can see , hitler and his party were no where near being `` peaceful '' until they won the election , stop spreading lies . 
  such things simply never happened in the fn party . 
  can you show me any proof that le pen will start being even remotely fascist by opressing or killing people , or are you now just making shit up because you dislike them ? 
  by your logic we should n't allow any party , because they could *** possibly *** do some shit . 
  that 's why i was reffering to this subreddit 's axeggarated reaction regarding the `` surprise '' that she is polling 40 %, 
  no chance as in i am pretty sure that when the first 2nd round polls came all of this subreddit said that there is `` no chance , no way '' for le pen to win against anyone . 
  now the odss are closing in . 
  france , the uk , most of all the big countries that could be a regional power . 
  regarding the whole refugee situation eastern europe in general . 
  yeah nazi party , sure . 
  i remember all of the killings and opression that fn has done througought the years , it was horrible . 
  it started as `` no chance for le pen '' , then it went to 30-70 , 35-75 and now 60-40 . 
  seems pretty similar to another big election that happened in the usa just recently . 
  we 'll have to wait and see but i can certainly see a le pen presidency . 
  indeed , it will be an interesting result either way . 
  maybe the uk and france leaving the eu will make those unelected officials start thinking about how to actually reform the eu and stop trying to impose refugee quotas on countries that do n't want any . 
  also it sends a clear message that people want the eu to be a balanced union of nations , not one dominated by germany and a few other countries . 
   what good will come of it for us in the poorer parts of the continent ? 
  why would it cause some great damage to our economies ? 
  we are not even in the eurozone , we somehow managed to deal with our issues without the eu up until recently , why would it be any different now ?
