the multilingual countries you mentioned , as opposed to belgium , have a majority that is responsible for most of the national ... responsibilities ? 
  ( i do n't know the political term ) , while in belgium , the central government tried to divide them equally between the 2 regions . 
  also that 's not true at all , the belgian identity is the same as the , say swiss ' : first belgian , then flemish or walloon.and there are a lot of things which both regions take pride of : the tintin comics , the architecture , the food etc. 
  brussels in that scenario wo n't be an issue actually , since the capital is surrounded by the largely [ francophone halle-vilvoorde area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brussels-halle-vilvoorde ) , part of flanders .

   120000 armenian living in nagarno-karabakh today , what about armenia , how many azeri living there ? 
  ftfy, 
  already posted . 
  totally , it 's not like there actually are french vegetarians as well ... ( sarcasm ), 
  the most mindblowing thing i saw all day . 
  because both of them always mantained hatred against each other ( at least at a political level ) . look at the title of this post.that kind of stuff should have ended in 20th century . 
  haha , made my day, 
  i know it is in b&h , but i doubt croatia wo n't take it as an attempt to destabilize the region . 
  have you read further ? 
   they are slavs who made the assimilation of the macedonian culture ( which originated from greece , but i do n't have to point that out , do i ? 
  ) disappear of course they wo n't call their country `` macedonian people '' , that would be just dumb.what are you doing right now is nitpicking , and you 're doing it because you ca n't actually find anything that will make what you said relevant in any way.you have no idea about this topic.good bye . 
  for some reason , i feel very uncomfortable singing or hearing it . 
  jesus , is it so hard to kick out those who do n't work , like other countries in europe do?plus , as long as we have our passports , we have absolute freedom of movement already.we 're in schengen pretty much in every aspect but name .

  imagine how many romanians will be in other european states now if it was n't for schengen.there 's a reason behind everything . 
  yep , same here.my country try to push our religion deep in our brains and you will have a hard time here if you do n't follow it , especially from the elders , being as conservative as it gets.we 're much like saudi arabia of the orthodox world , but without the beheadings and the lack of rights.religion seems to be more and more against modernization.and that pisses me off , because a big amount of money are poured in churches , even if we have hundreds already.it 's a very edgy subject and that 's why i do n't mention very often that i 'm agnostic . 
  of course there is also the more open-minded generation , who do n't give a shit about the subject , and it seems that it rises pretty quickly.we 're in europe , after all . 
  thanks.people here are very religious and you will be called names if someone finds out you 're a free-thinker . plus , we have tons of churches.sometimes , i 'm ashamed of romanians being so judgemental with others than christians ( gay marriage is n't allowed either ) .

  yep , sounds about right.btw :  you are white and christian is agnostic ok?i do n't require churches ( muh orthodox country ) and i wo n't push religions down people 's throat ... please ? 
   you are white and christian , so you have no rights to move from romania or even tell something . 
  lol . 
  like , being completely careless about the entire game . 
  not illegally anyways . 
  it 's more than that.due to the hungarian majority in the region ( from which i 'm guessing the mayor is also hungarian ) , they want autonomy . we would give them autonomy if they did n't have so much hate for the romanians.they have almost nothing written in anything else but hungarian ( as a person who has actually been there ) and most of their politicians are extremists when it comes to their identity , therefore this happened.those fuckers even have a [ flag ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsmoe4iyjlz_kcheoalciao-t9_dc3y-zkbpd38kkqyeo9gzxzjgg ) of their own . 
  no actually , the refugee crisis did n't affect us much , so there 's not much happening here . 
  heheheheh ... as much as i hate eu , that was clever . 
  oh.thanks for the heads up . 
  iran has enormous amounts of oil as well.plus , usa already sucks every drop it can from ksa 's dick . 
  unless you have that friend who travels a lot to help you , european stuff can get ridiculously expensive online.but if the stuff you 're searching is found in multiple places around the world , you should find it in china too . 
  lol i wish.politicians here use corruption as an excuse to trial people who they do n't agree with.there 's no `` fighting with corruption '' . and that 's why we do n't protest like moldova.romanians are brainwashed into thinking something is changing .

  oh please.you guys are angels compared to the other eastern europeans.there 's a reason for letting you in the schengen area .

  finally , at least someone realizes how much potential iran can have as an ally.even with the sanctions , they still stand strong.it also can serve as a good foothold for the isis problem . 
  heh , i get you.i was amazed how cheaper it was to buy a phonecase from hk than , say uk , even if i 'm in europe.you should try sites like ebay , there the products are usually much cheaper .

  ahem * i spread my ass cheeks for soviet.it penetrates my butthole.it hurts so much , but i do it for soviet.i can feel my odessa tearing as my eyes start to water.i push against his force.i want to please soviet.it roars a mighty roar as it fills my butt with his propaganda.romania walks in.soviet looks straight into his eyes and says `` it 's all russia now '' . it leaves through the transnistria.soviet is love , soviet is life .

  do n't spew your bullshit here.it was first practiced in iran.iran is n't just desert , unlike many arab countries . 
  also learn to read , you illiterate cunt.i saud almost impossible.plus , i doubt they 're more fertile than europe.get your facts straight , ignorant child . 
  we also had a big chunk of bulgaria 's territory , that 's why i mentioned it in the first place.and i never said it was a romanian state.what i said is that our ancestors also controlled a big territory , including northern and central bulgaria.if it is that way , you ca n't claim complete ancestry to old bulgarians either , since the ottoman empire influenced your idedtity a lot . 
   nothing to do with a statehood are you sure you know what a state means ? 
  if it was such a joke to you , why did you bother having this discussion in the first place ? 
  then do n't complain about us not accepting them , idiot.they 're the ones making the asylum shopping . 
  i also wrote the time in which all those things happened.way earlier than wallachia.also , the migratory groups influenced too little in order for most romanians to claim ancestry to all of them.in fact , the only reason that made me write about the migrants was to contradict the fact that bulgarians were here first.as we are daco-romans , you are thraco-slavs . 
  not my fault , i 'm on my phone and it tends to have a lot of glitches.i do n't have access to a computer where i am right now . 
  yes , but besides the coldness , they had animals which they could kill and take their fur , so they could bear it.also they still have relatively good soil for agriculture.on the other hand , for people living in the deserts , namely arabs , cultivating is almost impossible.you first worry about the food , then about the natural resources and the industries . 
  criticize us as you wish , but we 're too poor to welcome them all.they do n't want to stay here anyway.also we care if someone crosses the border illegally , why do n't you ? 
  syria does n't allow israeli citizens in their country , but syrians now demand admission in israel ... i sense hypocrisy here . 
  you 're wrong , romanians were descendants of the daco-romans . dacia was 165 years under the reign of the romans , compared to 800 years in the south of the danube.only after the roman rule was not prevelant in dacia , the migrants came ( including slavs ) . so no , i 'm not claiming ancestry only to dacians , that would be just silly .

  not really.their streets are as bad as ours and there 's trash everywhere . 
  it could have relied on allies ' aid.we became a satellite state once with the yalta conference , since we switched sides too late . 
  lol nope.the tribes were unified once with burebista in 82-44 bc in dacia , until 106 ad , when we were conquered by the romans .

  i know , but i 'm not sure who he talked with about the [ belgium video ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3732qm/belgium_explained/crje439 ) . he often tends to have some mistakes in his video , like bulgaria being in the soviet union ( it was n't , it was just communist ), 
  let 's just anschluss each other into a federation.we 'll be stronger than ever before . 
  yeah , i just watched it now.i was hoping for a mention of romania in the video and i got more than that ... hehehe . 
  is something wrong with what i said?nauru has [ settlements ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_settlements_in_nauru ) , not cities.on 21 km ^ 2 , there 's not much they can build.and do n't tell me nauru has faster internet connection than europe .

  i know i wo n't return either , and one day there wo n't be anything politicians will steal anymore , but by that time the sharp population decline will transform eastern europe into a desert.sad indeed , but when they realize doctors and teachers deserve more money , i will remain here .

  because they made us submit to their stupid communism when ussr still existed , because they stole moldova and now it 's the poorest state in europe , because they still have their wet dreams about their soviet union etc. 
  is n't that enough?and to top it off , our proximity to russia put our westernized influence in danger .

  besides being regarded as racists by everyone else , almost nothing . 
  holy shit , you guys are actually doing something against corruption.good for you and i hope you guys will get a corruption-free parliament . 
  you should n't . the jail time is too short and instead of taking the money from the mayor , he can keep them after he is free.the leaders will never stop stealing .
