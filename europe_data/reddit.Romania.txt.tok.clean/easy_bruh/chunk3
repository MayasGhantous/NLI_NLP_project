  it 's illegal under international law . 
  period . 
  polls and demonstrations exist for the sole purpose for convincing the government to consider your opinion . 
  with a signature drive , you basically try to declare independence illegally . 
  punishment does wonders . 
  the only burden is that the german government thinks that ** equal ** and ** privileged ** are the same thing . 
   refugays definitely stealing that lol, 
  i 'm fully aware about the intolerance of homosexuality among muslims , but sorting people is not like sorting your clothes . 
  it has to be reminded to them that they find themselves in a completely different culture compared to what they 're used to . 
  and if they crossed so many well-off countries , then they at least need to respect that culture they so craved . 
  i think he should . 
  you should n't play neither with politics , nor with deep-rooted hatred unless you know exactly what you 're doing and how to push all the right buttons . 
  edgy . 
  * sigh * yes , some countries in eu are corrupt and the govts have their flaws , but eu is very far from a dictatorship and it 's only progressing . 
  there are leftist and right-wing newspapers in every country in europe , even germany , and they face no restrictions . 
  neither do parties like afd or the golden dawn . 
  politicians immediately resigned when we had our protests in bucharest a few months ago . 
  merkel has little power in other countries ' affairs other than advices and constant begging , and she knows that damn well . 
  can you name an eu country which faced sanctions or a halt in trade with germany or france because it refused to respect the minimal refugee quota ? 
  of course not . 
  the only reason that may incline somebody to think that some countries resemble dictatorship in eu is because of badly organised voting systems , which is a completely different thing from what 's happening in turkey . 
  but of course a poorly interpreted image ( sometimes not even criticising the context they 're used in ) would change the opinion of so many redditors . 
  of course it is . 
  who are we to even consider us as a democracy without using an electoral college style type of voting or a system that favourizes the military who constantly overthrows the government ? 
  or the rich ? / s, 
  not trying to defend turkey here , but why is everyone still talking about this ? 
  it 's really annoying to see this in every turkish thread instead of actually debating about the subject . 
   i hate uneducated ** europhiles ** like you . 
  not even those pesky * europoors * can compare to the piece of heaven that is the united kingdom . 
  no ukrainian ? 
   the dutch have worked and traded and fought to get their well earned money , but the fucking south just holds up their hand and asks for money . 
  that is not how you build a great union . 
  do you know how you do not build a great union ? 
  by denying our schengen entry because you fear competition for your sea ports , despite us meeting all the requirements . 
  you 're hypocritical as fuck . 
   romanians and albanians are stupid people that can do two jobs : build houses and steal . 
  fucking german and british tourist trash up the places . 
  but ... latin brothers and all that ... 
  not that we have a reason for hating on the country ... 
  totally not . 
  * pulls out scroll * * ahem * fuck russia . 
  we have a lot of historical reasons to hate russians , but i can turn a blind eye to all of them . 
  but you keep fucking around with europe like it still is less powerful and in a worse shape economically than you . 
  heck , even italy has a bigger economy than you . 
  russia has gone downhill a lot since the ussr . 
  you 're hardly a superpower these days . 
  it 's not really about ukraine in particular , fuck ukraine too , but because you still act like you deserve to do that and then wondering why the hell we impose sanctions on you . 
  fuck netherlands for still refusing our entry to schengen . 
  the only reason you still deny us is that we own the other side of danube-rhine-main and you fear that rotterdam will have competition in ee . 
  fuck you for having that kind of mentality . 
  i know water is your thing , but chatting shit about migration and not letting us in schengen are kind of hypocritical things to say , considering that travelling inside eu is already not a huge deal . 
  let us having our share if you want to see us developing , alright ? 
  fuck ukraine for messing around with us and our territories . 
  you have loads of resources , why do you give a darn fuck about that tiny island ? 
  also being all proud and shit about lviv and cernauti when those were heavily influenced by nearby countries does n't make you any better . 
  ^ ^ even ^ ^ if ^ ^ we ^ ^ did ^ ^ the ^ ^ same fuck moldova for always shoving us in the front row when you demand help with transnistrians . 
  as much as we 're related , we 're different countries and we wo n't give you any more help than eu does . 
  also for thinking moldovan is a thing . 
  fuck hungarians for still bitching about trianon and for leaving behind a really vicious minority . 
  i actually do n't have any better reason , i just included it for the sake of not having my inbox butchered by the angry romanian comments . 
  actually we do have the planned border fence with us . 
  and orban . 
  fuck him in particular . 
  fuck the turks for abusing their regional power status and fucking with countries nearby , like cyprus . 
  i wo n't mention the eu thing , because i know you 're not into it anymore , but i will mention nato and the fact that you should stop acting like you deserve more respect and authority in that organisation just because you have the biggest army after the us . 
  you 're powerful , i 'll give you that , but no more than at a regional level . 
  ( also , we surpassed your gdp per capita , yay ! ), 
  should i bring the scroll for the historical hatred too ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's what they disagree with . 
  also , just because you love a country does n't mean others love it too . 
  look who 's talking . 
  clever . 
  i know , that 's why i expanded the abbreviation in the description . 
  it 's like you did n't even bother reading the post . 
  besides , have you actually read those `` hateful '' comments ? 
  you 're the only one here chatting shit about him , man . 
  to be fair , * all * of us thought slavery was ok at some point in history . 
  tie between hungary and turkey . 
  romania has the best internet in europe . 
  it 's funny how western europe always is surprised that advancement , although small , exists in ee . 
  we 're not that shit , come on . 
  switzerland , switzerland , german switzerland , switzerland . 
  damn . 
  [ so basically a polish ebadd . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qwbwt/at_least_25_dead_after_explosion_in_romanian/cwixr1z ), 
  finally . 
   people from balkan countries are also huggy-huggy , they kiss each others ' cheeks even after the first meeting i 'd probably take a step back if someone i barely know tried hugging me . 
  i think someone above mentioned that we do n't do it in romania . 
  even women do n't get anything else than air kisses ( they have to touch cheeks though ) . 
  men - handshakes women - ( air ! ), 
  kisses, 
  i do n't think sarkozy will have now anything to say about the constant immigration of french jews in israel . 
  edit : refering to [ this ] ( http://www.algemeiner.com/2016/01/11/former-french-president-sarkozy-we-did-not-fight-nazis-to-force-jews-to-run-to-israel/ ) . 
   speak an unintelligible pidgin that bears only the vaguest resemblance to german . 
   the netherlands do n't throw stones when you live in a glass house . 
  thanks . 
  full list ? 
  joke --------------  your head ninja edit : the vulgar latin descendence part is sort of true , because the grammatical features of romanian for example , are taken straight from classical latin , while the vocabulary is indeed from vulgar latin like every other romance language . 
  jealous . 
   i might be confused but my understanding is that a us passport gets you what is basically an automatic 90 day tourist visa when you arrive in a schengen country .
