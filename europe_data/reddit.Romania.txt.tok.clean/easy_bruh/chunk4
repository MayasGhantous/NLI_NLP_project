  that 's the stamp in the passport . 
  maybe that 's the wrong term . 
  besides the fee and showing your passport , you can move freely in any eu non-schengen member . 
  the procedure is roughly the same as in any eu country . 
  the only difference is that you can stay in other schengen members for up to 180 days while still keeping your hungarian residence permit , but the 90-day limit remains for the other eu countries and after that you have to apply either for a residence permit or a long-stay visa . 
  wth you 're talking about ? 
  i crossed many times the border and besides showing the acts and paying an insignificant fee , i was good to go . 
  also , no visa if you 're already in eu . 
   then there 's the situation with travel visa 's , heard a bunch of border guards trying to think how to tell the american tourist that he ca n't return to schengen for 3 months now that he was out , they decided it was his own business and hope for the best . 
  i have a few expat acquitances in canada and no one told me anything remotely close to this . 
  not to mention that usa does n't require visa for going into eu either . 
  passport or not , immigrants are still going to come . 
  it 's really not that much of a difference travel-wise . 
  yes , i know that , but i saw that many people here in romania ( especially those who do n't work in commerce ) like to complain about not being in schengen . 
  i was refering solely to the travel purposes . 
  eh , who cares anyway . 
  one document less when travelling abroad is something not worth concerning imo . 
  happy cake day btw . 
  edit : talking exclusively about travelling . 
   for the eu though , ~ 30 languages is much more complicated . 
  personally , i think they should create a modernised form of neo-latin , so that everybody would have to put a little bit of effort to learn it and nobody would be favoured . 
  or we could just take over esperanto , since it 's the only artificial language with a reasonable amount of speakers , it 's ridiculously easy and it centers mainly around european languages . 
  i personally like the idea for each continent to have its own lingua franca , and it 'll be awesome if we could do the same for asia and africa , though for asia it might be difficult because there are tons of languages there . 
  he does nothing . 
  absolutely * nothing * . 
  well from what i know , east germans were allowed to travel only to countries part of the soviet bloc , but in other countries like romania you were n't allowed to cross the border at all , so pretty much everyone who spoke a foreign language was given looks here . 
  e ** rekt **, 
  it 's almost like france should also take part in that european problem . 
  i do n't know how bad spain has it , but italy is flooded with illegal immigrants . 
  considering this , i think it would be wise to impose some border controls , at least having the passports and/or ids checked . 
  haha laughing at politics is a * totally * normal thing to do . 
  yeah , just say fuck all if they get through greece , right ? 
  leaving schengen did n't stop them to go through serbia and bulgaria , mind you . 
  they 'll bypass these countries in their way to eu anyways . 
   because he says stuff ** everyone ** thinks , but dont have the courage to say . 
  you may want to rephrase that . 
  take a map and point with me : in which part of france is calais ? 
  at the northernmost tip . 
  which part of france is closer to the major source of immigration ? 
  southern part . 
  so unless they took a plane to uk before going into france , it 's basically escorting them through the entire country . 
   except that australia does n't need to police 10.000 kms of ocean border unless you are worried about a penguin invasion from antarctica . 
  what about a huge country jam-packed with 250 million people and rampant corruption right north of australia ? 
  sounds like the perfect source for boats filled with illegal immigrants to me . 
  or , to have a situation closer to the syrian refugees , what about rohingyas ? 
  after being rejected by all se asia , what country is next on the list ? 
  most probably bulgarian jews moving in the israeli settlements built in west bank . 
  plus who needs potatoes when you got those goddamn nukes amirite ? 
   true escapism . 
  enjoy it while being racist at the expense of romanians . 
  you do realize op is romanian too , right ? 
  not anymore . 
  we left you for the eumpire , and you 're not invited . 
  not if we annex bulgaria first !, 
  [ ^ ^ ^ soon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans#/media/file:karte_suedosteuropa_03_01.png ), 
   easy bruh , dont turn this into a ** balkan ** dick measuring contest . 
  * triggered * / s also , i was just continuing the joke . 
  no one is trying to win anything here . 
  [ lmao . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_diaspora#distribution_by_country ), 
  except the situation is much , much worse in tibet . 
  while the other ethnicities in transylvania were given the `` tolerated '' status , china basically cleanses the entire region culturally . 
  they destroyed nearly all the buddhist monasteries ( from 6000 to only 8 ) , they exiled the current dalai lama , the region is under complete surveillance , tibetan kids can only speak mandarin at school and anyone who dares to cross the border gets killed instantly . 
  not to mention that only a part of the region has `` autonomy '' , if you can call it that . 
  so edgy . 
  [ and bulgaria . 
  name one exact comparison . 
  yes , somebody pointed that out already , i should probably edit that . 
  throw constanta in the mix and the original comment and its replies contain basically all the `` best cities '' in romania . 
   sz\u00e9kely land was a border region and the sz\u00e9kelys were sent there to protect it . 
  period . 
  they did n't send them to other parts of the country because they did n't want to colonize it . 
  it 's really as simple as that . 
  if we learned something from ussr , it 's that just because a regional power borders the country they conquer , it does n't mean it 's not colonization . 
   it was very unique and a hungarian invention to oppress minorities at the time who told you that this is what i was implying ? 
  just because hungarians oppressed minorities does n't mean it was their invention . 
  you just do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  good day . 
  i 'm aware that many roma people prefer to identify with the country they live in , but i 'm also aware that are a lot of romanians who claim roma ethnicity in order to gain the benefits they get from the state . 
  the number is debatable really , but still , the main point that the percentage is average for a south-eastern european country stands . 
  also , i do n't get why you downvoted my comment ? 
  was it rude to ask for a source ? 
   in fairness , official statistics are bs ... romani groups claim 8-10 % , which is about the same they claim for bulgaria and hungary . 
  source ? 
  what about the region between transylvania and hungary ? 
  last time i checked , oradea was on the other side of the border . 
  the current border between romania and hungary is located where at that time was the middle of the kingdom of hungary . 
  plus , i 'm sure that if the szekelys ( sorry , no diacritics on my computer ) were protecting the borders , they would have settled in their immediate vicinity , not dominating an entire chunk of transylvania . 
   those were small enclaves not part of some misterious conspiracy against romanians . 
  there are bigger german enclaves than those . 
  clearly you do n't know what a conspiracy means . 
  also it 's really funny that you 're getting the german enclaves into this , considering that the saxons were discriminated as well along with every other ethnicity in the region except hungarians . 
  the center of romania , or sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld , as you like to call it . 
   your map clearly proves both my points . 
  look closer . 
  see those green bits ? 
  they 're clearly `` all over the place '' . 
   no , the sz\u00e9kelys were sent there to guard the borders . 
  i do n't know in what world you live in , but borders are ** not ** in the center of the country . 
   if we wanted to populate transylvania with hungarians we would 've planted them all over the place ( which we did n't ) .
