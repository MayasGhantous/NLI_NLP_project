  i have turkish friends who perfectly assimilated and do n't have the nationalist mentality the turks i 'm talking about seem to have . 
  fucked over ? 
  you would n't even have been included in nato and so many european maps ( including the one that this subreddit uses ) if you were `` fucked over '' . 
  you are n't part of europe because of the way turkish citizens behave and think . 
  you would n't even dream being in the council of europe if we `` fucked you over '' . 
  oh come on , seaside has barely seen negative temperatures ever . 
  after coming back from the netherlands ( from a trip , not actually living there ) , i started to appreciate more the smooth pronounciation romanian has ( it 's a romance language , after all ) . 
  after hearing that ear-scratching dutch g all over the place , it 's good to be home . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'd rather say that austrians were the ones to spread this type of architecture in the empire . 
  europe . 
  age does n't mean much , honestly.those houses built 100-150 years ago can very well resemble the model of bulding made earlier , therefore the point that those cities are also cultural centers stays . 
  not sure what your point is.houses can be built in any city , no matter how old it is.not to mention that the modern era architenture is not the only type you can find here . 
  ~ ~ this is your chance to invest in eastern romania people ! ~ ~, 
  hah , i thought i was the only one that thought they look like sleepy eyes . 
  iasi , constanta , bucharest ( before communism ) are also pretty spot on . 
  germans , yes . 
  hungarians , not so much ... plus , it 's not like we did n't come with anything.just look at cernauti ( ukrainian city with romanian influence ) and you will know what i 'm talking about . 
  ironically , the only cultural centers in ukraine ( cernauti and lviv ) are also the cities with the greatest foreign influence . 
  * sorry , off topic *, 
  no kidding.i was surprised to see how similar prague and sibiu are when i went to cz . 
  til that poland is as old as romania . 
  ( [ for reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_transylvania_with_romania ) ), 
   haha . 
  sounds like a superiority complex . 
  i 'll leave you with this : pot calling the kettle black . 
   sounds like being exclusionary and subtly advocating ethnic supremacy is the problem . 
  like do you guys really need any more examples of why `` ethnic values '' are bad for europe ? 
  if you really want to get subjective , here it goes : you 're not european and you will never be.your turkic friends azerbaijan and kazakhstan did n't manage to get in either.we share nothing with you.we thought accepting the land west of istanbul as part of europe was enough of a modus vivendi , but no.and i 'm not going to feel guilty in any way because i 'm white , so stop with the `` ethnic supremacy '' thing , you just sound ridiculous . 
   there 's an argument that the concept of the european continent came about as a way to exclude the ( african and asian ) `` other . '', 
  now you 're using it as a vehicle for modern islamophobia . 
  oh come on , let 's just invite the whole arab world in europe then !, 
  people like you are the reason why being far left became a problem.the term `` europe '' was first used by greeks to differentiate their culture from the semitic ones that surrounded them.what 's east ( or south ) of those people groups is no longer our problem . 
   do you consider georgia , armenia and azerbaijan parts of europe ? 
  or just the former two ? 
  why georgia and not turkey ? 
  do tell . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , i definitely consider georgia as part of europe.i would consider armenia too if it were n't for their geographic location . 
  following that logic , north africa should become asian too , since they accepted islam as a result of arab influence.the well-known dutch tulips were originally brought from turkey.should we consider dutch culture turkish ? 
  also being part of the history of another continent does n't mean you 're part of that continent.or let 's just put uk , spain and portugal in the americas if we 're going to accept turkey . 
  there 's a reason we accepted finland , which is n't an indo-european nation and at the same time far enough to put it in asia , but not turkey and kazakhstan . 
   so you 're admitting the arbitrary lines drawn in the dirt have nothing to do with geography but everything to do with religion then . 
  yeah , we 're just going to ignore the fact that hinduism , judaism , buddhism and christianity ( lol ) are also very prevelant in asia . 
  when was the last time you saw a castle in the state of georgia ? 
  they adapted the religion from the ottoman empire.this has nothing to do with ethnicity , culture ( well maybe when it comes to food ) or language . 
   it 's funny because one of the biggest reasons you 're not independent in the first place is because you decided to go subjugate some brown people in the new world , failed , and bankrupted your country . 
  not relevant , but ironic . 
  also , we did n't install tony blair as the prime minister of the uk , you did . 
  what 's more ironic is that you also installed a president who decided to start a war in iraq in 2003 , while scottish people today have no impact whatsoever on something that happened in 1690 's . but of course , it does n't count if it 's a ` murican subjugation of brown people . 
   with all that oil money you do n't actually have ? 
  91 % ( in theory ) of uk 's amount of oil is a pretty large amount , is n't it ? 
   considering the most common reason i see scots on reddit claim they should be independent is that `` we 're so far to the left of england , '' the idea that you could be the next switzerland is pretty absurd . 
  switzerland is a very conservative , right wing country . 
  i think he compared the quality of life of those countries , but even that would be absurd . 
  georgians share a lot of ethnic and cultural values with europeans , more than turks , actually . 
  [ think a bit more outside of usa . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_ ( country ), 
  of course , what kind of romanian would i be without mamaliga ? 
  get a room , you two . 
  he should invest in eastern romania . 
  i mean in the english language . 
  besides , how awesome would it be to have a country called kartvelia ? 
  blood blood ~ ~ ( why is n't this in the book of b\u00f6rks ? 
  you clearly have n't seen bucharest . 
  for uni ? 
  i doubt it 's better than [ biltong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biltong ) . 
  would you give up golden sands for mamaia ? 
   average price of a house in european ** cities ** this does n't include houses in suburbs `` near '' a city or a house 20 km from the closest one . 
  `` fuck no , we wo n't unite with those bloody immigrant countries , praise the channel . '', 
  `` oppresion '' is a bit harsh , is n't it ? 
  because in bulgaria , like in a lot of post-communist countries , it 's a lot easier to find an apartment than a house.plus a poor eu nation serves as a great comparison for the western world . 
  i bet munchen is in the top for germany . 
  romania not really.slovenia and croatia seem to be getting there , czech republic is already pretty `` western '' , poland is getting close too.but in romania the development pretty much halted as far as the quality of life is concerned . 
  because some people actually like a country as opposed to its money?just because we 're eastern europeans that does n't mean we 're coming ~ ~ only ~ ~ for the opportunities . 
  really ? 
  do n't you have any common sense ? 
  because he thinks that not only every european country , but every european person should take action for something that some rednecks with no common sense did in a romanian club.that is really , really far from how things work.not to mention that so many americans die because of things that need even more stupidity to be put into practice . 
   my deepest thoughts go out to everyone living in a european country . 
  i 'm truly thankful that i do n't have to witness these tragedy 's first hand . 
  i hope you can all find it in your hearts to do what is necessary , please write your politicians so they can prevent anything like this from happening again . 
  people like you are the reason that usa has such a bad reputation.i never saw such ignorance in my life . 
  i seriously do n't know how you 're still allowed on this subreddit.i 'd normally say that you 're a troll , but looking at what you commented before , i can safely say that you 're not sane ** at all ** . 
  most ee countries are dependent of russian gas ( especially bulgaria and the baltic states ) , so the thing is that the population is divided on the issue of further implication with other powers.a lot of people * , as surprising as it may sound , and not in favor of eu ( i 'd say 30 % , something around that number nonetheless ) , so the high trust surprised me . 
  * i spoke only for my native city , bucharest , which acts like its own province , but it still seems to have high trust . 
  we are . 
  they 're in nato , otherwise russia would have invaded them already . 
  i did n't even know who are the member states until now . 
  only written forms of a language can be accounted as evidence , therefore romanian language did n't exist until 16th century.flawless logic . 
  here 's a tl ; dr of how old romanian came to be : when the indo-european tribes split , dacians settled on the land that today is romania.in 106 ad , after two wars between romans and dacians , romans finally conquered dacia.in 271 ad , the roman empire withdraws from dacia , and the latin influence halts as well.that 's when the migratory groups enter romania : huns , avars , goths and slavs.the slavic influence on romanian ends in the 6th-7th century , when they migrated in the [ bulgarian territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_influence_on_romanian ) . 
  also the first magyar tribes settled in present-day hungary in late 9th [ century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huns#claims_of_hunnic_origins ) . that being said , i think i can claim more european heritage than you . 
  the migratory groups presented little to no influence in romanian history.if you want to debate on that , the notable exception are the slavs , since they hold a fair share of our vocabulary ( ` da ' for ` yes ' for example ) , but at least 70 % of our vocabulary is latin-rooted . 
  note : some may say romanian is the closest living language to latin , but that 's not true , because some words that may seem latin are actually derived from other latin-derived languages , particularly french . 
  yes , it is.most indo-european cultures ( missing the elephant in the room , the slavs , because of their migratory past ) certainly can hold on this title more than the finno-ugric peoples do . 
  no.neither is the ottoman empire . 
  uhhh , the bars are red and blue to differentiate the terms , it does n't have any conotation . 
  this is not so impressive , considering that in countries like germany , not owning a house and paying rent for one instead is pretty normal.that 's why other western european countries rank so low . 
  in which country are bulgarians allowed without a visa , but we are n't ? even if our citizens are seen as roughly the same politically and it 's one country difference , it still got me thinking about it . 
  maybe they 're doing the brazilian dialect , because it 's easier to pronounce . 
  what about just raising their salaries ? 
  ... hahahahaha , nevermind .2 corrupt4me, 
  at least some progress is made .
