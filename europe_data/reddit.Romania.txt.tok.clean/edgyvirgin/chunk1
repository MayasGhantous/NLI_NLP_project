it 's all in your head mate , it 's all in the tone you choose to read it with . 
  i 'm sarcastic and could n't give a fuck , writing these comments in less than 10 seconds while taking a crap . 
  k very smart comment . 
  a comment about my username . 
  so original . 
  such logic wow . 
  genius . 
  how about the trade deficit exists because it 's too expensive to produce the imported stuf inside the uk . 
  the trade deficit also means that the uk will want to contine trading , it goes both ways . 
  you are commenting on my comment tree fuckface so you fuck off and the only people i 'm calling retard is you . 
  and no i did n't got schooled , the eu is the biggest trade block in the world in terms of volume of goods and services traded and soft power . 
  you linking a list of countries by gdp means dick shit . 
  read ** trade block ** come back when your iq is in the '90 range you inbread pice of crap . 
  eu is definitely not number one in retards , that palce belongs to great ` murica . 
  and stop your failed troling using the fifis rhetoric . 
  the snowflakes and pc culture is a ` murica thing , only place we have that in is in a place called sweden . 
  most people are not on reddit and they do n't even know it 's a thing . 
  my fifis are fine tard face . 
  no need to be sorry . 
  i 'll let you know when you need to be . 
  says stupid shit and links a list of countries by gdp as if i evern claimed we had the highest gdp or as if that proves anything regarding tradeblocks . 
  you stupid fuck . 
  you have convinced me . 
  makes sense . 
  sure . 
  for whom ? 
  hey man i get you but thing is , life gets so much better if you learn to enjoy the good parts and live in the present regardless . 
  it 's not something that happens on its own though , i have to make myself smile , like , do things and go out of my comfort zone all the time and in the end things are just better . 
  after all what we like and how we react to things are just habits we ingrained in our brain through repetition . 
  take care . 
  except you were n't just an island but an empire . 
  the money has to come from somewhere , they 'll probably agree to some kind of subdivision of the cost based on gdp . 
   you need to come up with an attribute that is larger for the eu why ? 
  no i do n't . 
  what makes something the biggest is the sum of its characteristics not a hand picked index . 
  and if you need something then that 's soft power and volume of traded goods and services which is exactly the point of a trade block . 
   the uk actually has a trade deficit with romania so ? 
  what has this got to do with anything ? 
  eu is 27 countries not romania and uk . 
  secondly , trade is not suddenly going to cease due to our independence . 
  who claimed this ? 
  it 's just harder without access to a the single market due to bureaucracy and taxes and if you think this wo n't impact your trade with more than your net contribution ( 5-7 billions which are peanuts ) to eu 's budget then you are mistaken . 
  not sure how you interpreted my last comment . 
  it was a joke , kinda true though  ) take care mate . 
   net beneficiary of the eu budget . 
  typical ~ ~ british ~ ~ leave logic . 
  i guess by your logic only london matters in uk ? 
  the eu made much more money than a couple a billions a year romania gets in net funding from having access to the romanian market and access to a 4 million young diaspora that was raised and educated by romanian money . 
  it 's a mutual beneficial relationship but i do n't expect somebody citing budget figures to get it . 
  besides being depressed and cynical assholes , romanians ca n't take a joke to their own demerit because of an inferiority complex . 
  as opposed to eu not being the biggest trade block because of a single bigger attribute some other trade blocks have . 
  you sound like the regular smug dutch to me honestly . 
  see how that works ? 
  so because two different trade blocks have ** one ** attribute bigger than eu this means eu is not the biggest trade block in the world ? 
  i never claimed we have the biggest x because it 's stupid to measure the size of a trade block by just one characteristic . 
  i pointed you to some figures which sum indicate the eu 's power as a trade block . 
  you just assumed what suited your shitty agenda . 
  also if you are going to count nafta and asean as a trade block comparable to eu than you need to also include the whole eea area when accounting for gdp and market size . 
   http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/, 
   population = china  gdp = usa not a trade block  market size/value = gdp ? 
  no  as for trade volume , i guess that you are including inra-eu trade which obviously makes for an unfair comparison what do you think a trade block is buddy ? 
  population , gdp , market size/value , trade volume and value , soft power and every other measure you can think of that measures the power , size , value and importance of a trade block . 
  i was a self-righteous cynical asshole at 17 . 
  i swear i was born old and depressed and i 'm getting younger as i 'm aging . 
  how will the biggest trade block in the world ever find 5-7 extra billions a year ? 
  / s uk leaving will leave bigger holes like soft power , a political setback and access to a market ( pending the trade deal ) . 
  the eu budget will manage . 
   russia is ahead of france by ppp gdp . 
  in your wet dreams mate . 
  wish i could fuck up my job and be given 17 billions from taxpayers money . 
  so is this a loan or are they just gifting 17 billions to extremely rich incompetent assholes ? 
  looks like barilla pronto shit with some carrots . 
  i am not emotionally involved in this conversation mate . 
  eye roll, 
  just read the rest of the thread . 
  you are not serious are you ? 
  same thing can be said for paris . 
  no bias / s, 
  we spend more than russia and china , where do americans get the idea that we depend on them ? 
  you are the most important player because you spend a lot but that 's not the same as depending . 
  it 's not like we have no army ffs . 
  you are making it to simple . 
  it 's entirely possible that a worker will spend your x days a year in different countries . 
  which labour laws do you apply then ? 
  there 's no way syria wo n't get split after this . 
  most males will be considered attractive by a certain demographic or another if they are fit enough . 
  but yeah you 're right . 
  not that progressive , just a [ forgotten fashion ] ( http://historylink101.com/n/egypt_images/male-kilt.jpg ), 
  i mean as long as you are fit , not skinny not fat , you can pull it off great and if the skirts are designed for men then it can really become a trend . 
  skirts look great on dudes . 
  the negotiations and reforms will most likely take 10 to 15 years as they did for all other balkan eu countries . 
  true , it 's their shitshow . 
  233 is the 50 % +1 241 total mp voted . 
  more than 40 % abstained which is the same as voting `` no '' in this case . 
  so the motion barely passed , in fact it only passed becaused psd managed to attract some other pms . 
  the ruling coalition psd+alde did n't have enough votes on it 's own . 
  or he just hit the wrong letter which is right to the correct letter on the keyboard . 
  nobodt is butthurt , you 're just reading too much british propaganda . 
  usa build the bomb in a couple of years from scratch 70 years ago . 
  you greatly underestimate what a developed country can achive if they make it a national priority .
