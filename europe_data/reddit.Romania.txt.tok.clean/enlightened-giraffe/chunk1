again , you seem to think it 's about shaping history or what is objectively important or valuable , it 's not , not even a little bit . 
  dracula is known because he is the poster boy for vampire fiction , a domain that gets new books , movies , tv shows , games , etc almost every year . 
  this has also been happening for quite a long time so it 's not generation specific , he 's one of the best known fictional characters in human culture for crying out loud . 
   ( like the fact that a romanian invented the ink pen or another one the jet engine ) you seem to think these things are actually interesting/relevant in the same way , trust me , they are not , although a few promotional campaigns here have stressed this point . 
  every nation has all kinds of inventions and all have a story and a place , many of them much more important than what you mention , but almost none are as interesting as a character/story/legend that is part of global ( pop ? 
  ) culture . 
  while it 's true that bullet wounds can be quite `` light '' it would be naive to think that officers can consistently shoot you in the leg in those specific ways . 
  over a statistically significant number of incidents taser usage will always cause less damage and fewer fatalities than gun usage . 
  people view the fact that you can die from being tasered as sort of a proof of false promise . 
  `` you mean this is n't a magic weapon ? 
  but is n't that the point of a taser , to not kill you ?!, 
  well then it 's bullshit ! '' . 
  people also forget that you can die from hitting your head while falling down and all sorts of seemingly `` painful but safe '' incidents . 
  sometimes the circumstances are just so , the angle , the place , the pre-existing heart condition , whatever , sometimes it 's the exact receipe for death . 
  when you hear that somebody died from being shot by police officers it seems like a given , but in most cases police do n't shoot to kill . 
  they shoot to `` disable '' , a careful and well placed shot to the legs , at least that 's what they try to do . 
  it just does n't work that well , these are n't controlled & stable situations , everything that can go wrong with a taser shot can go wrong much faster with a gun shot . 
  nobody said you lack the educational system , you lack the people to which to apply it, 
  yes , ** everything ** is bribes, 
   -- our mayor switched from psd to pdl , and in so doing a lot of money suddenly appeared  yep bribes :d not everything is bribes goddamit !, 
  if party x is governing and party x holds the mayor position in a town then it will give a lot more funding to that town so that the people who live there see how good party x is for them ( even if they do n't do well on a national level ) and elect them again - including the mayor that just switched to party x. 
  in the meantime another town in which the mayor is from party y will get a lot less funding so that the people there will conclude that party y is shit and not vote for them again . 
  no , thank god, 
  and tiraspol would be under water  http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=46.9227,29.3501&amp;zoom=9&amp;m=60, 
  it happened this year as well ( this past month ) , pretty bad but not comparable to what was then or what 's happening now in serbia and bosnia, 
   yes , to replace nuclear capacity . 
  ftfy ? 
  there is no reason to consider it part of eastern orthodox history , it 's a political organization , not a party of the church, 
   no point in posting about corruption cases being found out around the country that 's very good news too in my opinion , until recently they just did n't `` want '' to find out about it, 
  it 's the same thing in romania to vote you only need an id card . 
  every id card has your registered address and come election time the database is polled for every voting area to get a list of residents . 
  you appear on the list at ** one ** voting facility , that which is closest to you registered address . 
  if it is a nation-wide ballot ( presidential ) you may vote in another city by filling out a form . 
  if it is a local ballot ( city elections or parliament - which for us is nominal ) then you can only vote at your assigned facility . 
  if romania can do this right it 's beyond me why other states ( excluding those that do not have mandatory id cards ) ca n't . 
  this is not registering ** to vote ** , having an id card is mandatory and necessary for any formal interaction . 
  you can ( and will be ) fined if the police asks you to present it and your id card is expired . 
  like everything in romania , superiority complexes are not very well organized, 
  there is no such thing as an angle grinder in romania , only the allmighty flex , even professionals use the term, 
  why thank you , kind viking !, 
  even though dacians are a rather obscure part of european history they were interesting in their own way , especially their obsession with hats . 
  it was basically a non stop team fortress 2 game until the romans came and spoiled the fun . 
  this is why modern day dacia cars do n't have a sunroof , ancient dacian law said that only nobles may wear a hat and the dacia is still just a cheap little car . 
  but one day we 'll get our hats out of the closet , mark my words !, 
  now , let me go trade in this gold for a drill , i must prepare for saturday !, 
  i expected as much , the thracian bloodline is strong !, 
  shh , no tears , only sarmale dreams now, 
  oh , did n't notice the secret colonization must be going well then, 
  many of you are probably wondering why romania is number one ( besides romania stronk ) . 
  there is an ancient ritual , legend says passed on by our dacian ancestors , of drilling holes saturday morning . 
  but why ? 
  i hear europe cry out in confusion . 
  there is no simple answer , we have no need for so many holes and there are n't that many things in an apartment that need drilling , and yet we keep doing it . 
  the leading theory is that around 45 years of age the romanian man starts hearing the call of his dacian blood and thus the ritual must begin . 
  he will buy a cheap drill and many things into which to drill , all the while having no reasonable explanation for why he is doing this . 
  apartment buildings across romania sing together in this glorious saturday morning anthem , signaling to all that our ancestors did n't want us to sleep at 8 a.m. on a fucking weekend . 
  you can load up the speeds by location and a lot of the top administrative units are small towns and villages it 's also very cheap compared to most other countries, 
  all of them ? 
  or are you by chance cherry-picking ? 
  even if you are you should still mention what exactly you are referring to , otherwise you might as well just say `` stuff '', 
  what are you basing this on ? 
  this would be relevant but the earth is n't an isolated system , we have a huge net energy input from the sun co2 would become biomass again only because of solar powered photosynthesis, 
  no worries , reddit is mostly pro nuclear power , especially dat sweet thorium, 
  many finite resources can be recycled feasibly , in the long term even the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels will be reabsorbed into biomass and we will be able to use it all over again for energy , but with nuclear a tiny little bit of mass is actually converted to energy and we 're never seeing that one again , so in a way nuclear is the least renewable form of energy we have . 
  in practice and for the current `` era '' of humanity nuclear is a great power source and the recent denouncements of nuclear plants are a sad step back . 
  quite insightful !, 
  thanks , i think i 've understood as much as can be understood from your point, 
  okay , can you at least back up the fact that it inherently creates barriers ? 
  not quite the same as being always toxic, 
  is nationalism always a barrier between people ? 
   nationalism is always toxic you better back that up, 
  i ca n't guarantee that it 's the same for ukraine but in many states if you are a dignitary you are obligated by law to declare all assets and investments ( yearly ) . 
  this is exactly why , i do n't think they came by to check if he has any less gold bullion than declared . 
  ... what ? 
  there is just no chance for a quick entry into the eu for ukraine , there are huge differences in socioeconomic terms , ca n't see that gap being closed in something like 5 years , even with significant effort from both parties . 
  hell , romania and bulgaria have been members for 7 years and the contrast between them and the western states is still a problem . 
  nato on the other hand is something else entirely and if the tactical play pays off we might see ukraine as a member in a few years . 
  while your point of view is valid , it is fragile at best medical services are not comparable to many other fields in that you can either work for the state or for a highly regulated private industry in which the sate 's validation is also necessary . 
  also , such a system is in no way discrimination or limiting free movement in the eu , medical universities are not a god given right , it is a service mainly funded by the state ( and it requires significantly more funding than other universities ) with which you sign a contract . 
  that contract can be either : - pay nothing or only partial costs and in exchange work for a minimum of x years in the national health system - pay full cost and do whatever you want both are quite fair . 
  better yet , you could do it like this : make medical school a lot more expensive ( entire true cost ) and the state loans you the money . 
  as long as you are in the medical career `` system '' ( university -  residency -  full doctor ) you pay nothing and every year after graduation the states decreases your debt , by 10 years it would be entirely paid off . 
  for students that stay here they would pay nothing at all and would feel no difference , for those who want to leave the country or want another career they would have to pay off the cost of education as a normal loan . 
  hilarity ensues when michael 's competitive streak surfaces , `` our tanks hav run out of ze gas , yes ? 
  we park right here and you amerikans go around und invade somwhere else '', 
  it 's nice that we have each other, 
  this is not specific to germany , but general : in a multiple party system , parliament seats are divided between a number of parties proportionally to election results . 
  either before or after the election a number of these parties form a coalition so that they have 50 % + ( simple majority ) or maybe even 2/3 ( required in some cases/countries for special laws ) , one party rarely gets a majority so even the most powerful one must compromise . 
  the coalition is usually one big party + one or more small parties , but in some cases there are only two big parties . 
  the coalition parties form a government ( with ministries/departments being negotiated between them ) and run the country having both executive and legislative power . 
  the parties that are not part of the coalition are in opposition , they have certain tools/methods ( defined by the country 's constitution ) to control and balance the coalition in power but these are not effective in cases like this . 
  basically the opposition can not impose their doctrine or policies , they may speak and propose things ( as they represent a part of the country ) , but that in itself is no indication of said things being implemented . 
  on the way !, 
  goddamit , i 'm going to hope for ukraine or maybe greece then, 
  sorry , we already called iceland-shotgun , just hoping for no surprise volcano !, 
  this is a serious issue too , somebody stole our autumn !, 
  declaring yourself orthodox and being an active follower of the church is not quite the same , and while it 's somewhat taboo to declare yourself atheist or agnostic i 'm pretty sure church attendance is on a downward trend . 
  i am very skeptic with sources like the national census where i believe most people declare orthodox out of inertia , but rarely go to church . 
  i also suspect some tampering , the census reported only 33 thousand atheists which seems like a laughable number , but i have n't seen any independent and reliable studies either , so i guess we 'll have to take it as it is . 
  i do n't know anybody that thinks the cathedral is wisely spent money , i 'm not sure where that majority is,
