  this situation will not last for more than it already did . 
  previously , by `` strong army '' i meant `` ability to endure/wage war '' as that 's really what war is all about . 
  it does n't matter how big your army is or how much mediocre hardware you piled up if your country 's economy and population are not able to sustain prolonged war better than your enemy . 
  and de already has phenomenal ability to endure/wage war even without help from nato . 
  it would take them only months to turn their vast aerospace / auto / heavy industry into a war machine and there is n't a major military on this planet who does n't fully understand that . 
  after all , power is nothing if you do n't use it to your advantage somehow . 
  there is more than 1 way to get a strong army . 
  keeping the population captive in a low quality of life , hooked on propaganda and fearful enough to desire autocracy is one way . 
  but this will not hold . 
  it will collapse again just like it did in ' 89 . 
  a well educated population , living in a healthy democracy and in a strong economy automatically results in a strong army . 
  national propaganda often presents war victories as coming from glorious actions of key individuals who were also geniuses in exploiting opportunity . 
  this is far from reality . 
  war is always won by the party who made the wisest investments before the conflict and has the stamina to sustain said conflict . 
  it 's not movie-cool but this is how things have been since forever . 
  the best deterence would be having a united europe with healthy democracies on the east and strong economies capable of sustaining at least serious war costs if not r & d to create their own full retaliation . 
  that would be the wall western europe needs to forget about russia ever bothering them again . 
  humans are social animals . 
  we need to belong to a group and all our progress came from grouping together and defining social order and rules . 
  until recently , when we reached the age of instant access to any global info for any individual free enough to search for it , our nation was unquestionably one of the most defining groups we belonged to . 
  like any large social group , a nation 's dominant characteristics were hard to change , which is a good thing because it ensures a large pool of individuals of the same mind who can more easily get along working together towards higher goals . 
  then global hyperconnectivity happened . 
  all of a sudden every individual is bombarded with predominantly bad news about their group . 
  government and administration are almost always corrupt and incompetent , economy is almost always bad , army is almost always weak , crime almost always happens everywhere you look , life-long values about sex , women , family and religion are generally trashed . 
  we live in a time of profound societal change that erodes the feeling of belonging to a nation , even for those belonging to successful ones . 
  however , i think our belonging to this kind of group will still be of major importance for at least a few generations and the european nations will be one of the most affected by their people having to split their feelings between belonging to an ethnic group , a country and a continental confederation . 
  fortunately , the natural forces fusing us together seem unstoppable in the long run by anything except a global cataclysm . 
   the [ ebu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union#european_sports_championships ) 's highest profile production is the eurovision song contest , organised by its eurovision network . 
  the eurovision network also organises the ** eurovision dance contest ** , the ** junior eurovision song contest ** , the ** eurovision young dancers ** competition , and other competitions so much more,

   you should be set for life * * as long as you do n't plan living too much afterwards, 
  thanks . 
  did n't knew about this and it 's ironic i learn about it here . 
  i think the time when anyone cared has passed, 
  resigned out of shame that they were not men enough to kill themselves , like the rest of the crew, 
   really think about it . 
  you should also really think about changing times . 
  perfectly valid laws once allowed mutilations . 
  things change radically . 
  an international treaty of this proportions can have a basic set of hard rules on 2 pages that govern its basic purpose . 
  there should be absolutely no need of a lawyer interpreting this high level document for most voters . 
  there is no way of convincing me otherwise . 
   would you advocate for the destruction of every single international treaty then ? 
  why would i ? 
  what 's done is done . 
   most were negotiated in the last forty years that 's dark ages for me . 
  even 10 years ago you could n't have most citizens directly connected to every word on every legal document ever . 
  today you can . 
  things change . 
   you ca n't negotiate in public i demand it to be done . 
  it will be a different negotiation that what you want but it will be a negotiation nevertheless and it will be a great opportunity to see what the different voices from national parties have to say about various proposals . 
   what actually is the problem with that ? 
  the problem is that this is a democracy and i do n't want that . 
  it 's that simple . 
  complex incomprehensible legal documents are not democratic as they do n't empower the people to take a well thought out decision . 
  i do n't know who from my country took what bribe to let slip in some obscure note that i will never understand regardless of how many years i look at that document . 
  secret negotiations are a cancer that needs to be exterminated . 
  no exceptions . 
  too complicated to be directly interpreted by most people without requiring a lawyer ? 
  vote no . 
  negotiated in secret ? 
  vote no . 
  it 's simple and i profoundly do n't give a fuck about `` this is how it was done in the dark ages '' . 
  today most people can be live-connected to this kind of negotiations , unlike any other time in history . 
  keep it simple and open and then i will think about voting yes . 
  collect them all !!, 
   bulgaria can lear a lot from this false . 
  bg [ prime minister assures us ] ( http://focus-fen.net/news/2016/03/21/401115/bulgaria-has-outplayed-romania-in-any-aspect-long-ago-pm.html ) the reason why there are no convicted politicians in bg is because none of them is corrupt and , also , bg has outplayed ro in any aspect long ago . 
  so we 're dragging bg down , basically . 
  * but also not proudly , like the politically correct whore that i am *, 
  you picked a bad example . 
  english is incredibly omnipresent in many people 's life . 
  eastern europe , for example , had whole generations of kids who grew up immersed in us culture , without subtitles , and then later had to learn directly from english books . 
  of course we assimilated the language early on and now those kids are parents and they make sure their kids pickup english from kindergarden . 
  you should compare your strugle with someone trying to learn some other language . 
  lol . 
  eu is the best thing that happened to romanians in the last couple of centuries and 3-4 million have relocated for work to italy , spain and other eu countries . 
  there 's no chance such talks would find audience here , regardless of how generous the sponsors would be . 
  i ca n't even imagine who would be stupid enough to open their mouth on this . 
  well , if scotland and northern ireland leave following brexit , what the hell remains besides london ? 
  i agree, 
  `` you would 've done the same '' is another failed argument, 
  `` we 're all the same '' is not going to fly . 
  some of us are way way more guilty than others . 
  i have n't heard good things about gd but i 'm with this guy on this one . 
  how can the bbc , who like to think of themselves as supremely unbiased and neutral in their presentation of facts and opinions from all sides , waste resources on this amateur team of high school reporters who instead of gathering the opinions of the interviewee manage to turn him hostile in the first 2 sentences with their negligent approach of issues they knew fully well are sensitive to this guy/gd . 
  and then they leave with their snarky `` good lucks '' and `` nice to meet yous '' ... these guys are not pro reporters . 
  welcome to reddit , where nobodys think they 're royalty and `` low quality '' is a stormy discussion about dead serious topics while the top post on this / r / is what the word `` world '' is like in various languages , followed by the most importantest topic of who goes to eurovision from ukraine . 
  abortion is also bad for the child and sometimes bad for the father too but the mother can do it anyway . 
  you are not at all guaranteed having 2 parents . 
  the mother ( not the child ) gets to have some money from the father for 18 years . 
  there 's a big difference between that and actually having 2 parents . 
  but for every bull 's eye like this case you have 10 others with life destroying sentences for much less serious crimes , so it 's not all roses and sunshine, 
  so then why does n't 22 qualify for reduced sentences ? 
  18 is not magical but 21 is ? 
  i do think this guy should not be returned to society and made to work for a decent life in prison . 
  to you , this makes me sadistic , prejudiced ( against someone who burned the mother of his child alive while pregnant with said child ) and vengeful and you would rather have this murderer ( plus a piece of paper saying rehabilitated ) as a neighbor than me . 
  lol . 
  you 're like that character from every american movie ever who needs to investigate even though it 's obvious to everyone what will happen next . 
  this is a valid inequality between men and women .
