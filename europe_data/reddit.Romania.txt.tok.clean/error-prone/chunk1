same here . 
  :( any suggestion , enlightened one ? 
  we have mucenici ( meaning martyrs ) here in moldavia region too , we call them `` sfin\u021bi\u0219ori '' , for the feast of the 40 martyrs of sebaste . 
  but this is on 9 march , not easter !, 
  my grandmother makes them shaped like a figure eight , like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/luvmxuy.jpg ) . 
  brioche-type baked cakes , smeared with honey and topped with ground walnuts . 
  [ agreed ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/italy/ab-italyp2.html ) . 
  according to the partial results of the 2011 census , 3.2 % of the population are romani people . 
  some argue that some romani people lied about their ehtnicity ( and declaring they 're romanian ) , therefore the percentage could be higher . 
  great !, 
  i completely agree with what you wrote . 
  if both sides are open and sincere we both benefit . 
  that 's what cooperation implies . 
  initially i did n't see any assumption about eu vs us standards superiority ( i hope there is n't any ! ) . 
  in their defense , being an eu-oriented hub , the website is entitled to focus on the european issues/point of view . 
  ( and equivalently for the us websites/news ), 
  it 's immature to generalize the whole trade market just for this issue . 
  there has been mislabeled fish sold in usa . 
  see the oceana reports , [ here ] ( http://oceana.org/en/news-media/publications/reports ) . 
  example , from february 21 , 2013 : [ oceana study reveals seafood fraud nationwide ] ( http://oceana.org/en/news-media/publications/reports/oceana-study-reveals-seafood-fraud-nationwide ) dna testing found that one-third of the samples analyzed nationwide were mislabeled , according to the fda guidelines . 
   why do you believe the refugees/migrants [ ... ] left their home countries ? 
  single cause fallacy -- a multiple choice question could 've been better . 
  so you never played [ zeus : master of olympus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeus:_master_of_olympus ) !, 
  that the video is irrelevant simply because the speaker is british . 
  he 's being sarcastic . 
  it 's included in the [ new map ] ( http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/styles/colorbox-max/public/illustration/2011-fab-map.jpg ) .

  every new reddit account is subscribed by default to a list of ( * default * ) subreddits . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/default ) is the current list ( seems to be geolocation aware ) . 
  by the way , / r/europe is a default subreddit for european accounts since 2014 . 
  example [ discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c11xv/reurope_is_now_a_default_subreddit_for_europeans/ ) . 
  huh !, 
  i bought all [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/suuutvb.jpg ) cool books with 42 $ locally . 
  i picked the ones with discounts , though . 
  i 've been there in april . 
  my family was there a week ago . 
  we never expected/had any notable difficulties . 
  i 'm not trying to contradict the other guy , it 's just a limited experience of mine . 
  i 've heard differences ( sometimes amusing ) , but i think you get used to those . 
  i 'm from the moldova ( the region ) so maybe that helps a little bit . 
  the issue was the people that do n't bother unless you speak russian . 
  but what about hungary ? 
  yeah , although it 's still pretty important . 
  in 2015 , the total contribution of tourism to its gdp was 12.9 % . 
  it 's predicted to rise by 3.7 % by 2026 . 
  ( source : wttc ), 
  i write code and that 's a very confusing `` not equal to '' . 
  somewhat related : last year , i enjoyed nicely prepared pistachios grown in california , packaged in germany and sold in romania by lidl . 
  they were cheaper and better than the raw ones sold directly by the farmers in turkish markets ( i spoke with a friend who was there ) . 
  what the hell ? 
  they still made a profit despite the immense distance and processing difference ? 
  they missed the part where they beat that guy to death , cut his head and throw it over the bosphorus bridge while chanting allahu akbar . 
  for some reason , i thought their torrent database was outdated , so i stopped using it many years ago . 
  congratulations , you reached [ the top ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tdgywhr.png ) at google . 
  the word is yours !, 
  in fact , the english * or * is almost always an * exclusive or * ( `` either ... or '' ) . 
   it is sometimes argued that in many natural languages , english included , the word `` or '' has an `` exclusive '' sense . 
  [ [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_or#exclusive_.22or.22_in_english ) ] edit : although i 've read / u/akurei77 's answer and i understand what you 're trying to say, 
  sorry , i exaggerated . 
  it 's not wrong , i only find it bad taste and bad style . 
  i 'm sure it 's not for fun . 
  `` nice attack '' is bad because they can simply write `` attack in nice '' . 
  it 's more intelligible , anyway .

  #nice [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/753707069916655617 ) by fox news . 
  now they use #niceattack , like other news channels . 
  yes , let 's not upset the facebook activists now . 
  i wonder if that would make a big difference . 
  weird . 
  there was a [ survey ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1imf4r/the_results_are_in_the_official_reurope_survey/ ) in / r/europe 3 years ago with 2131 responses . 
  most people here were from the uk ( 18 % ) . 
  most of / r/europe was positive about the eu , the euro , and further european integration . 
  migration from eu to their country was positive/neutral . 
  euro-federalists were 27 % , while 10 % were euro-skeptics . 
  good job .

  he coached the rugby league team london broncos . 
  currently , he is a associate lecturer teaching in manchester . 
  he has now lived in the uk for 18 years and he does `` consider this place home '' . 
  it is only the second time he has been party to any form of racist attack . 
  some of what the aggressors said :  `` do n't chat shit when you 're not even from england , you little fucking immigrant . 
  get off the fucking tram now . 
  get back to africa . '', 
  they were caught a few hours later :  within hours of the footage emerging , greater manchester police arrested two men , aged 20 and 18 , and a 16-year-old boy on suspicion of affray . 
  they remain in custody for questioning .
