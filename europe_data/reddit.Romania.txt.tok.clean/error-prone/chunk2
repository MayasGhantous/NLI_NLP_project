  anyone watched the arianespace launch on june 18th ? 
  here 's some [ images ] ( http://spaceflightnow.com/2016/06/20/imagery-of-the-ariane-5s-blazing-blastoff-at-sunset-in-the-jungle/ ) and the [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/-cgooewtals?t=16m48s ) . 
  with a total calculated mass of 10 730 kg , it is the heaviest combined commercial payload ever launched on an ariane 5 rocket , eclipsing a previous mark set in 2013 , and it is the most massive satellite package ever put into geostationary transfer orbit . 
  the ariane 5 has now logged 72 flawless flights in a row since 2003 . 
   you need to subscribe to read this article . 
  the parliament will consider it for a debate , that 's all . 
  plus , it 'd still pass with only 3.6 % of the current signatures . 
  it 's owned by the dmg media , subsidiary of the [ dmgt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daily_mail_and_general_trust ) ( daily mail and general trust ) . 
  they also own the daily mail and metro . 
  that might mean something . 
  what do they say about brexit on mars ? 
   he was one big reason , why the uk left . 
  what did he do ? 
  ( i actually do n't know , i 'm currently getting familiar with all of this . ), 
  this time , i think he 's spot on . 
  whatever has to be done , there 's a lot of work . 
  [ same ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/curv%c4%83 ) in romanian , it says source is old slavic . 
  oops , corrected . 
  thanks . 
  there were pro-unification demonstrations in chi\u0219in\u0103u earlier this year . 
  but there is tension surrounding this topic since the 90 's . 
  both current and former romanian presidents stated that what we can do at the moment is to support their course towards the eu . 
  this could take a very long time . 
  i 'm not a connoisseur , but we occasionally drink cricova codru at home . 
  we had one of their sparkling wines for new year 's eve . 
  i 'll try other mentioned ones soon !, 
  thanks for caring . 
  i did n't know that and i live 25 km from their border . 
  there was a vote in the parliament for investigation on this issue , [ here ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-follow-up-to-the-resolution-of-parliament-of-11-february-2015-on-the-us-senate-report-on-the-use-of--10.html#/##vote-tabs-list-4 ) 's how the members voted ( individual votes in the 1st tab ) . 
  * thanks to / u/toreon for posting link in that [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4naqya/european_parliament_calls_for_investigation_of/ ) . 
  * romania and poland were the most opposed to it ( [ image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bto8rtb.png ) ) , with 96 % and 88 % against . 
  all our mps voted against except for [ one ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-mircea-diaconu-2.html ) guy . 
  oh no , the days are getting shorter !, 
  i do n't think it 's a valid point . 
  people that finished secondary school should know that . 
  at least , generally , the [ baltic states ] ( http://i.imgur.com/62qxna5.png ) !, 
  he could 've picked on many other eu countries ( like romania ) . 
  maybe the host is surrounded by worse geographic knowledge since he moved to the usa . 
  if the us states were independent countries instead , they * would * be taught in our school . 
  ( disclaimer : we have enough clueless people here but i do n't think it 's ok ; i happen to know the states because i find it interesting ) . 
   why should i learn < thing  if i do n't need it ? 
  i do n't care about < thing  . 
  that 's an interesting but non-trivial topic . 
  i think it starts a broader debate about education .

  too much negativity in this thread ( regardless of who 's right ! ) . 
  nice tram .
