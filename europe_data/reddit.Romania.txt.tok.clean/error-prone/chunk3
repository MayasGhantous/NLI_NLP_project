  the [ official site ] ( http://www.oecd.org/pisa/ ) has more education results ( global ) . 
  the map does pan and zoom . 
  what happened to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/589ojt/romania_will_not_sign_ceta_official_statement/ ) ? 
  `` romania will not sign ceta , official statement '' . 
  searching this subreddit , there was a lot of controversy regarding it . 
  i think the report is [ here ] ( https://www.ris-muenchen.de/rii/rii/dok/sitzungsvorlage/4277724.pdf ) ( pdf , 450 pages ) . 
  i 'll try to read it , got ta learn german first ( brb in 10 years ) . 
  why does it need to be a non-internet environment ? 
  for when the internet goes down ( service availability ) ? 
  maybe if you used linux more it would feel more intuitive . 
  for me this happened with gimp . 
  over a year linux only here , i forgot windows exists . 
  it 's making progress ... 2021 will be the year of the linux desktop !, 
  what about using the windows license funds to employ local devs to fix the problems they have with linux ? 
  because now that money goes straight to microsoft . 
   below 40 degrees south there is no law ; below 50 degrees south there is no god . 
  i think it 's an old sailors ' saying about the southern ocean . 
  found here : [ religion in antarctica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_antarctica ) . 
  there is a [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5rwsci/professor_who_works_for_belgian_university/ ) in / r/worldnews ( 15h older , 2280 + votes ) . 
  surely . 
  it 's probably the brandenburg gate . 
  this is just the top rated * thing to do * on tripadvisor for germany . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rqnadcu.png ) 's the global map . 
  the [ second place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cibtzw0.png ) is europa-park :d  we decided to collect every country 's top rated ` thing to do ' according to tripadvisor . 
  it 's the [ second ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jiy3ece.png ) ranked attraction . 
  that was close . 
  so it 's supposed to be [ grand place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_place ) . 
  on the website it 's [ correct ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/attractions-g188634-activities-belgium.html ) ( [ img ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zujklif.png ) ) . 
  probably the mapper 's error . 
  imo , in this case it 's ok , because it 's more like `` a series of events that make a story '' , and not the slang for `` extraordinary '' that you mention . 
  one teacher gave us weekly printed summaries consisting mostly of * date -- event * lines . 
  reading those was only way i ever fell asleep before midnight . 
  now , instead , i find it fun to stay late watching these videos . 
  i also find it easier to connect the described events . 
  au contraire !, 
  [ look ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qazlz2p.png ) at this unquestionable chart i found !, 
  `` stolen cars * by countries * '' : de = 35 % !, 
  germany please stop stealing so many cars , why do you need so many !!!, 
  more seriously though : sorry for that much car theft . 
  maybe the respondents felt threatened by a secret police ghost . 
  it 's `` julien '' . 
  his mother chose the middle name because she was impressed by the protagonist ( julien sorel ) of the novel [ `` the red and the black '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_red_and_the_black ) ( le rouge et le noir ) by stendhal . 
  it was difficult back then ( 1969 ) to get hold of a good book . 
  his father chose the first name . 
  their version is that some ( custom version ) of a god actually rewards this . 
  but * both * of these presumptions are likely wrong . 
  obviously , the worst part is the insane violence ( despite any rational discourse ) ... 
  after refresh , it went to the first dialog . 
  edit : at least i quickly got [ another survey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/923ujwv.png ) to fill . 
  so fucking useless . 
  their families and friends must be devastated now . 
  i was just listening to * a sunday kind of love * ... somewhere else the attackers must be celebrating . 
  we humans are so fucking dumb sometimes . 
  some info in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5doiuq/clearing_misconceptions_and_explaining_the/ ) and [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_constitutional_referendum,_2016 ) . 
  many voters saw this as a vote for/against renzi and not the actual reforms . 
  also , quite not quiet . 
  i was told that it 's pointless for germans to have an alternative to reddit because they use reddit already . 
  does n't this map suggest otherwise ? 
  suppose you sell a product with a dishonest description and the client keeps it . 
  does that make you feel bad in any way ? 
  maybe it was [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jgyfe77.png ) image from [ this ] ( https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/ ) article . 
  worked here , but the program might 've used error correction . 
  i used qtqr . 
  amen !, 
  maybe the correct year was 1988 ? 
  not secret anymore , thanks to you . 
  great job !, 
  i 'm curious to know if there is a safety mechanism in this case and how it failed . 
  that 's obvious , because coconuts are less likely to fall on a shark . 
  [ you right now . 
  there 's more leverage dealing with future giant economies ( china , us , india ) as the european union . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wgyfevg.png ) is how it shows up for me ... 
  so that 's why there 's [ keine bremsen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tlecvwd.png ) ? 
  ( btw can i use * wenn * like that ? ), 
  we have [ trains ] ( http://imgur.com/stbnatz ) that go 140 km/h but are limited to 45 km/h because of the infrastructure . 
  no , it 's for internet . 
  asking the right questions . 
  i like the [ colors ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jfl3yox.png ) . 
  although not the [ official ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_bulgaria#colours ) ones , right ? 
  they look a bit more [ serious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pjheulr.png ) .

  i have it on cassette tape . 
  sure . 
  i was suggesting that some people would n't share the article if the website is annoying . 
  so i think the popularity is diminished , i could n't tell if significantly or not . 
  personally , i would just find an alternative source for the article . 
  they still can , if you distribute the link ( e.g. 
  on social media ) . 
  they even reached [ the final ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_fifa_world_cup_final ) of the 1934 fifa world cup \u2122 ( the 2 ^ nd edition ) . 
  some exceptions : the [ ioc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ioc_country_codes#current_nocs ) ( international olympic committee ) , [ fifa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_fifa_country_codes ) and [ iso 3166 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-1_alpha-3 ) ( the 3-letter codes ) . 
  `` why is siberia cold '' . 
  * sigh * ... why are mountains high ? 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  i got `` why is france the best country '' ( [ sshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gfsbr4r.png ) ) . 
  it 's a joke and obviously , i had to check . 
  ^ [ url ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/ ), 
  unleash the bots !, 
  wait . 
  so * information technology * does not include * software development * ? 
  thanks for the honest discussion with [ deleted ] , very interesting .
