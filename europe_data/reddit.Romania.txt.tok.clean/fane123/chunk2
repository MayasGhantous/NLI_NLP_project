  so why do they `` choose '' to live there ? 
  that 's just fucking bullshit . 
  i come from a medium town ( around 20k people ) with a population of 10-15 % romas ( not mures , but close ) and more than three quarters of them are living their lives the best they can without making any trouble.there are maybe a quarter that are more vocal and `` in your face '' but generally they stop at that . 
  probably less than 10 % are the actual `` bad gypsies '' that go commit violent crimes and steal . 
  the fact that the bad get all the publicity and the stigma of the `` evil gypsy '' in romania makes you see the 99.9 % you talk about . 
  the truth is that in romania we grew up on stories about the bad gypsies , we scare our children that if they wo n't behave we 'll give them to the gypsies and we teach them that gypsies are something to hate . 
  but we do n't like to see that we live in a society , just like the french people , that just ca n't be bothered . 
  we prefer to push the problem away , a problem that we created , rather than deal with it . 
  if you would look closer , all those opportunities you speak about are not really there . 
  as we teach our children to hate them , their children will feel it . 
  so their real choice is to go to a school where everybody hates you and reminds you all the time that you are a sick aberration that should be killed or stay home . 
  but we should not look at it this way since it might make us look like the `` not so perfect model citizens '' that we are , some might even call us racists . 
  pfff !, 
  nonsense !, 
  they 're just born with evil dna !, 
  sure it does . 
  you just have to be norwegian or swiss, 
  the one they 're building ( the one i linked ) is estimated to cost between 500 millions to 1 billion euros ... 
  not in the near future . 
  to be honest , even if i do n't like the idea much , i think that only private hospitals will be able to retain some good doctors in romania . 
  the national health system is corrupt and badly underfunded ( there are hospitals without running water in some towns ) and getting a job for a new doctor depends on what connection you have ( people you know inside or people you pay/bribe to get the job ) and the system rewards the more corrupted ones ( more `` gifts '' they take from patients , more money they have to pay upwards and climb the ladder to position of more power and influence in the system ) . 
  in a private hospital , who will be focusing on making as much money as possible from patients , no need to pretend otherwise , a good doctor will have a high value and will be payed similar to western countries and in time probably even more , like in america . 
  but of course , like in america , private healthcare has some really big drawbacks especially on the poorest people , which make the majority in romania . 
  ideal will be the english nhs , but the systems fights against it from inside . 
  it 's ok !, 
  we 're building a really big church !, 
  we 'll have the best healthcare in the world !!!, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_people's_salvation_cathedral * scroll down to cost and financing ...  the government announced it will donate 30 million lei ( $ 8 million ) and the romanian parliament enacted a law by which further half of the cost of the cathedral will be paid from the state budget . 
  he did n't : http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1wgr3e/so_you_want_to_come_to_slovenia_2_dogs_1_bear/ it 's / u/fbass who did . 
  peaceful where ? 
  your reply was to someone from romania who did n't have a peaceful revolution but a very violent one with the army shooting the people , yet it was done and for the better . 
  ukraine had a peaceful protest for months now and did n't solve anything , maybe even made things worst . 
  just have english ( us ) mentioned as official language . 
  that should give them enough grief . 
  no problem !, 
  show off !!!, 
  i 'm pretty sure the last picture is not a skyline . 
  fixed !, 
  thanks for the bit of information about hatters , quite interesting !, 
  thanks mate !, 
  i worked in uk for 5 years , no longer there now , and despite all this shit your goverment and right-wing activist throw around , i think the british are some of the best people to work and live with . 
  so happy new year and fuck the haters !, 
  do you understand the fact that `` romas who come to beg and steal '' , as your dear daily fail informs you , do not * need * the right to work without restrictions ? 
  i left romania about 6 years ago for england and then , earlier this year , left england for norway.the way i see the `` brain drain '' from east to west is due to big change in mentality after the fall of the iron curtain . 
  speaking only for romania * , during the communist time the `` smart '' people were appreciated more , in schools the smart kids were the cool kids . 
  there were the so called `` olympics '' in every class ( maths , physics , geography etc ) and having someone win one at a school/town/county level was a pride for the whole class/school . 
  the teachers/professors had a tighter competition between themselves to get better students , better results in schools competitions resulting indirectly in a better education . 
  this all comes from the human nature to compete/show off . 
  due to the total isolation of the common people during the last years of communism in romania ( to an almost north korean level ) the intellectual show off was the only way to go . 
  after the fall of the isolation romania was flooded by a huge wave of information , bigger than everything else we had all hitting at once a relatively `` naive '' population , a ponzi scheme game , caritas , had maybe half of the romanians as victims few years after revolution , a con-game that was known in the west for a hundred years . 
  in this conditions the `` ghetto culture '' became an easier , faster way to show off trough money and bling . 
  this combined with the adversity the common man had at the time for everything that was related to the communism resulted that after 15-20 years since the revolution a mentality of being cool by avoiding education , by getting `` around '' the system and the fact that the people working and studying hard are the `` loosers/suckers '' resulted in the conditions of today where the smarter , more educated people tend to be really frustrated with this situation and try to escape from it in the places , like the west , where their hard work and education will be rewarded . 
  * maybe bulgaria fits as-well . 
  ps : this is only my opinion and the main reason i wanted to leave my country . 
  there are some signs the younger generation is trying to change things but they are fighting a huge beaurocracy and mafia right now . 
  most of them are not in europe , though . 
  you are correct !, 
  facts and moderation are , sadly , not sensational enough for reddit . 
  the link he provided states that the causes are just suspected and the political motivations are speculations , but most people seem to think that a statement on reddit followed by a wikipedia link is by default true , without bothering to read the provided documentation . 
   the reasons for the famine are a subject of scholarly and political debate . 
  some scholars suggest that the famine was a consequence of the economic problems associated with changes implemented during the period of soviet industrialization . 
   however , it has also been proposed by certain historians that the soviet leadership used the famine to attack ukrainian nationalism and thus may fall under the legal definition of genocide . 
  lots of oil up there in the north ... 
  bucharest and stockholm are two big multicultural cities full of young people and not very representative of their countries because of that . 
  you can hang-out with the youth of bucharest , stockholm , new york , london etc and not see a very big difference . 
  go a bit deeper , like taking an swedish village and a romanian one and you 'll see big differences . 
  also politically one of the most socialist countries oriented on the welfare of the middle class and an oligarchic one focused one the welfare of the top elite strikes me as a big difference . 
  and there are more things like the involvement of the state in promoting youth culture and sciences , the nordic akwardness etc. 
  also you can not remove the `` bad '' of romanian culture in comparing the two . 
  the bribing at every level that is socially accepted and taken as a normal thing in romania is part of our culture as-well . 
  you can not just take the `` similar to swedish '' side of the romanian culture and compare it to the `` similar to romanian '' side of the swedish culture and say it 's no big difference . 
  just the way i see it . 
  the difference in culture is really big between sweden and romania and that counts too . 
  the roma are completely different from both aswell . 
  my point is still staying i think , even if take your example of , let 's say , a swedish schizophrenic junkie living on a street , giving him money still wo n't help him much . 
  it may feel right , at the moment but wo n't help much . 
  the best way to help him , if someone would really want to help him , would be to inform social services or a ymca type of organization who could offer him more than just few kroners . 
  as for the gypsy beggars , giving them will attract more . 
  if they think small children will make a better profit , by taking advantage of kind-hearted peoples like you , then you 'll get 3-4 years old children begging on the streets of stockholm for 10-12 hours a day , if their parents get money from that . 
  i really do n't like it either to say that showing kindness is wrong , but in giving money to beggars in 90 % of the cases it is . 
  anyway you have to do what you feel right . 
  have a nice weekend !, 
  in my opinion the likelihood of honest people begging vs searching for social services help , especially in socialist oriented countries , is very small . 
  ask yourself what would you do in the eventuality of ending up loosing everything ? 
  would you go straight on the street begging ? 
  [ bbc one panorama : child beggars of london ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuommh-ahiq ) a documentary about romas begging in london , uk . 
  begging is illegal in uk , but this does n't change anything since children can not be prosecuted themselves . 
  if you can find this somewhere to watch in se it would shed some light on the begging scheme . 
  it 's been done for one of the best bbc programs . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0169lg6 quick edit : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuommh-ahiq, 
  they do . 
  animal activist adopt them all the time . 
  the problem is they just release them back on the street the next day . 
  they also `` appear '' overnight in different place . 
  usually in a 40-50 km away place from the place they disappeared from . 
  there are people paid to deal with the dogs , if the dogs are completely gone they wo n't get paid again . 
  ahem ... we do n't talk about the stray dogs here ... keep quiet , will you ? 
  you forgot to add some of the nicest houses i 've seen so far . [ tyrolerhus ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=tyrolerhus&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=c1iguuizgble4gskmycidg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=928 ) . 
  maybe not the most common house , but they are really nice . 
  do n't be sad , is probably double in norway : p,
