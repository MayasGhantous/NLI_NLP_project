   britain 's exit blows a hole in the eu budget and will be costly for some members , stoking tensions between net contributors ( such as germany , france and the netherlands ) and recipients ( many eastern member states ) . 
   the uk is the eu 's third biggest net budget contributor , paying # 140bn since 1973 . 
  more importantly it is scheduled to pay another net # 60bn in the eu 's agreed long term budget to 2020/21 , including # 26.4 bn in the two years after 2019 , its expected exit date . 
   if as part of a transition deal britain agrees to continue payments to 2021 , it would help the eu27 delay a divisive internal budget debate . 
  but it would also mean theresa may , uk prime minister , going into a 2020 election without any eu budget savings to show . 
   brussels is also aware that it is in the uk 's interests to remain in some programmes , like research funding . 
  `` for every piece of influence it wants to retain in eu policymaking it will have to pay a price , '' said andrew hood , a former uk government lawyer now at dechert . 
  the commission , meanwhile , is more worried about britain 's exit bill from outstanding liabilities , which runs to $ 40bn - $ 60bn . 
   defence and security is another uk strong suit . 
  gordon bajnai , the former hungarian prime minister , argues that a common eu foreign and security policy would be `` very weak in the future if the uk is somehow not kept in the system '' . 
  `` the uk could ask for much more in brexit talks if it somehow remains part of security and defence structures , '' he said . 
   but this is a card that may be difficult to play . 
  even after the election of donald trump , nato allies may see britain 's defence support as unrelated to brexit talks . 
  `` tying the two could really backfire , '' said one senior eu diplomat . 
  secondly , if the defence and security co-operation is to run through eu structures , ms may could lack the political support in westminster to make a substantial offer . 
   ** economic self-interest **  this is the trump card for ardent brexiters . 
  boiled down to its purest terms , it would involve the uk effectively confronting the eu with a choice : continue a zero-tariff preferential trade arrangement , or accept world trade organization terms . 
  `` the uk would recommend the former , but could live with the latter , '' said a group of pro-brexit former ministers , including peter lilley and john redwood . 
   underlying this strategy is confidence in the eu 's trade surplus with the uk and the economic pain from unwinding the deep cross-border supply chains in industries such as carmaking . 
  boris johnson , foreign secretary , has said it would be `` insane '' for germany to impose tariffs when brits buy a fifth of all its car production . 
   `` the strength of our position is our economic weight , '' said dominic raab , a pro-brexit former minister . 
  `` if we end up with a worst-case scenario , on wto terms , it hits continental exports disproportionately hard , costing european firms profits and jobs . 
  their rational self interest is to avoid that . ''  with time , mr raab expects business groups and unions to press politicians to `` avoid a masochistic outcome '' . 
  so far , though , officials in brussels , paris , rome and berlin see a different balance of interests . 
  carlo calenda , italy 's economy minister , most vividly summed up the mood when mocking mr johnson 's warning over italian prosecco exports . 
  `` i 'll sell less prosecco to one country and you 'll sell less to 27 countries , '' was mr calenda 's reply . 
   ** threats to the status quo **  some british ministers reckon that europe will eventually realise that there are negative consequences for all sides from a hard , sharp brexit . 
   one is the competitive threat posed by a uk unbound . 
  dubbed the `` singapore model '' , this is a scenario of british tax and regulatory `` dumping '' that european capitals fear . 
  britain is too big , too close and too similar an economy to not worry about being undercut . 
  the trouble is that while this has moved up the list of concerns , at present it is convincing countries like denmark and germany to take a harder line in brexit talks . 
   the second is the city of london . 
  this remains europe 's main financial hub and a hard exit could raise costs for corporate europe and inflame weaknesses such as italian banks . 
   david davis , brexit minister , has noted that more eu companies request a financial-services passport to operate in the uk than vice versa . 
  `` as a result , our negotiating leverage in this area is at least reasonable , '' he told the commons . 
   the third threat concerns the rights of more than 2.5 m eu nationals in britain . 
  this is a top priority for many eu states . 
  but any british attempt to exploit this would be extremely risky , not least because it carries the threat of retribution on 1.2 m uk nationals resident in europe . 
  `` the simple truth is that they are not bargaining counters , '' mr davis told the commons in october . 
   ** tactical opportunities **  at present , the eu-27 look more unified on brexit than on virtually any other issue . 
  but these are early days , and eu officials know that squabbling comes easily to the bloc . 
   britain faces a negotiating partner , in the european commission , with mixed authority . 
  while the bloc must speak as one on some eu issues , such as trade terms on goods , it can speak as 27 on other areas of national competence , such as residence rights and some areas of financial services authorisation . 
   that opens the door for some crafty british diplomacy . 
  while britain may not threaten to throw out existing eu residents , it could vary , country by country , the generosity of offers on future residence rights . 
   the same goes for fishing rights , security co-operation , or bilateral offers of financial support to eastern european states losing eu budget receipts . 
  such side-deals would chip away at eu unity . 
   one potentially decisive factor is out of britain 's control . 
  should anti-eu forces make more headway in national politics , most notably with a marine le pen victory in france , it could transform the context for brexit talks . 
  eu unity on brexit could reach a tipping point , where the eu starts to fragment , helping britain to negotiate a more bespoke deal . 
   again , this is extremely difficult for britain to exploit without souring talks . 
  when meeting the eu side , mr davis has stressed that britain 's interest lies in a strong , stable , effective eu . 
  `` that is what he says , '' said one senior eu negotiator . 
  `` and we do n't believe him . '', 
   i think you said earlier google 's ones tend to be the best available and currently i agree , but what if they were n't , would it still be good to have them forcefully bundled on the android system ? 
  maybe not , on a principle level , but then again , since they 're free it 's all the same for the end consumer . 
   right . 
  but to preinstall the play store , suppliers must install the full suite of google apps . 
  this gives google chrome and google 's search services an advantage over their various competitors . 
  what various competitors ? 
  i understand what you 're saying but i still believe that the consumer has no particular advantage from buying a smartphone * without * those google apps ( not the whole suite , just search , maps and chrome and the play store , of course ) . 
   the eu have a problem with companies using their strength in one market to force success in another . 
  which is the other market in this case ? 
  you 're welcome . 
  no , of course the main traditional german manufacturers wo n't tank , they make quality cars , the best in the world i 'd say , but a little more competition from non-traditional players ( tesla & co ) is beneficial for the consumer . 
   way back in the 1990s , my first job on the financial times was to cover german industry , which effectively meant the car industry . 
  germany in the 1990s was like detroit in the 1950s or early 1960s . 
  the industry was at the top of its game . 
  profit margins were large . 
  the companies started to expand , into other brands -- like vw and bmw -- or into other industries , like daimler . 
  the chief executives of the car industry were the bosses of the bosses . 
  they had the world as their oyster , and the government in their pockets . 
   but those who feel strong and stable are prone to errors . 
  much of the stuff that has come to the surface in the past couple of years had its origin in those earlier times . 
  the latest news is the accusation that the five large german carmakers -- vw , bmw , audi , mercedes and porsche -- colluded in a cartel covering 60 different areas in which they agreed not to compete . 
  this included braking systems , the size of tanks , and diesel technology . 
  they held secret meetings going back to the 1990s . 
   perhaps the most astonishing example of industry 's arrogance became visible last week when the german government pulled porsche cayenne diesels off the street and ordered a stop to sales . 
  the federal motor transport authority discovered that porsche had used the same cheating software vw used in its cars . 
  you might have thought german carmakers would react to the scandal of 2015 by tearing the software devices out of their own cars immediately . 
   there are three reasons why the german car industry is in a lot more trouble than is widely acknowledged . 
  the least important of those are the fines . 
  they will be large , no doubt , and could reach up until 10 per cent of global revenues . 
  this is an addition to the multibillion-dollar fines for the cheating software . 
  the damages will reduce shareholders ' profits and available resource for investment . 
  but these are rich companies . 
  this alone will not take them down . 
   the second issue has been the industry 's misguided emphasis on diesel technology to the detriment of alternatives , such as hybrids and electric engines . 
  back in the 1980s , the german industry collectively bet the future on diesel because it had lower carbon dioxide emissions than petrol . 
  many of the environmental dangers were not known at the time . 
  while german carmakers continued to fine-tune their diesels , other companies like toyota invested in hybrids , while newcomers like google are exploring artificial intelligence technologies -- two areas which could fundamentally change the nature of private transport in the future . 
   on friday , a court ruling in stuttgart opened the way for a local ban on older diesel cars that do not meet the latest emission norms . 
  stuttgart is not only the home of mercedes and porsche , but also one of the more polluted german cities . 
  the city will not be able to meet its own environmental targets without a crackdown on diesel . 
  carmakers would not have installed illegal cheating software if they had found easy ways to reduce emissions . 
   the third and most important factor is an irreparable loss of consumer confidence . 
  scandals come and go , but the persistence of negative news reinforces negative views . 
  consumers have been paying premium prices not , as it turns out , for premium quality , but in support of an illegal cartel . 
  many customers have been duped by false emissions claims . 
  consumers ' rational response would be to seek alternatives or to pay less .
