  honeslty , i fail to see the big problem for eu consumers . 
  it 's their software ( the play store ) hosted on their servers and they ( alphabet/google ) have the right to do what they want with their ip and to impose limitations and constraints to manufacturers ** if ** the latter want their phones to ship with android os . 
  the oems that do n't like google 's terms can simply ship their smartphones with another os , e.g. 
  tizen in samsung 's case or a crippled android without the play store or windows phone or ubuntu etc. 
  not to mention that those google apps that come reinstalled are usually the best in business ( maps , chrome , keep , photos , youtube ) . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  the full text :  the trade-off between markets and immigration reform lies at the heart of the debate about britain 's post-brexit future . 
  so far , this has been characterised as the meeting of two unstoppable forces : the public desire to control immigration and the barriers to accessing european markets without conceding full freedom of movement . 
   yet maintaining that the uk can have everything or nothing represents a failure of imagination . 
  keeping free movement might be politically impossible , but a constructive new partnership with the eu , which works in the interests of both our politics and our economy , may not be . 
   the british public has lost confidence in how its government has managed immigration . 
  successive governments failed to predict , prepare or plan for the largest migration wave in modern british history , following the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 . 
  they then broke , and broke again , a pledge to cut net migration numbers , with each quarter 's statistics prompting dramatic headlines about a promise the government could not keep . 
   most people blame politicians , not the migrants . 
  britain is not a nation of xenophobes . 
  british future 's post-referendum research shows that the public is frustrated with what has gone wrong but also holds moderate views on migration after brexit . 
   some 84 per cent believe european nationals in britain must continue to be welcome here . 
   while two-thirds would like to see fewer unskilled workers arriving in future , only one in four would cut the number coming to work in care homes . 
  only a fifth of people want to reduce skilled or student migration and significantly more would prefer to see an increase in the number of migrant nurses , doctors and scientists . 
   there is no public support for an indiscriminate anti-immigration crackdown . 
  instead , three-quarters of people -- including eight out of ten leave and ukip supporters -- see brexit as the opportunity to get the balance right , to have more choice and control over who comes to britain while still keeping the immigration that is good for our economy and society . 
  britons also want to maintain our tradition of offering sanctuary to refugees . 
   this all presents a remarkable opportunity for a pragmatic deal on this most polarised of public policy issues . 
  seizing it would help to rebuild public confidence in britain as a society where immigration and integration is a positive thing . 
   that chance would be lost , however , if the response to brexit was to cling to the present arrangements without public consent , sending the corrosive message that what voters wanted did not matter , as the interests of the bankers had to come first . 
   it could also be lost if the article 50 negotiating clock ran down with no agreement in place . 
  in that scenario , the uk would logically fall back on treating eu and non-eu migration similarly , probably loosening the current non-eu regime to secure the migrant skills the economy needs . 
  that would be a political failure , not just for uk prime minister theresa may but for german chancellor angela merkel and other eu leaders , too . 
   but it is not the only alternative to full freedom of movement . 
  a new uk immigration system for eea nationals -- a `` friends and family '' deal that offers preferential european access to the uk labour market as part of a british deal on trade with the eu -- would be a constructive offer as we seek to negotiate a positive , post-eu partnership . 
   free movement might continue , reciprocally , for those with a job above a particular salary or qualification threshold , supplemented by quotas for low-skilled migration -- set annually by parliament , after public hearings with employers and local communities . 
  crucially , the first opportunity to fill those low-skilled migrant quotas would go to britain 's preferential trade partners -- and while this model could work for uk trade negotiations with countries like australia , india and canada , it would make sense to offer such a preferential trade and migration deal to our eu neighbours first . 
   this is not freedom of movement as it stands , so it may not secure unaltered single market access for the uk . 
  but it would give the eu27 nations , and the visegrad states in particular , considerably more access to the uk labour market than if the negotiations were to end in failure . 
   such a deal could secure broad political and public support in britain . 
  it would bring unskilled migration under uk control while still taking some low-skilled workers from europe under the new rules . 
  it would reflect popular support for skilled and student migration and move us away from the broken , one-size-fits-all net migration target . 
   crucially , it would help to secure public trust in an immigration system that squares the circle , showing how controlled migration could keep britain open to the skills that we want and need . 
  the full text :  this op-ed is part of the ft 's future of britain project . 
  we are inviting readers , commentators and thought leaders to brainstorm ideas for the future of britain after brexit . 
  this piece is in response to the third topic : how should the uk deal with immigration ? 
  for an alternative view , sunder katwala , director of the british future think-tank , outlines his vision for a migration policy that works . 
  submit your own idea here . 
   since the uk voted in june to leave the eu , immigration policy has become a battleground of competing ideologies . 
  frustrated remainers tend to argue that free movement of labour is essential to retain membership of the eu 's single market . 
  the contribution eu workers make to britain 's economy , exchequer and society is too often a secondary discussion . 
   on the other side , all considerations come after the government 's arbitrary target of reducing net migration to the `` tens of thousands '' -- which can be achieved only if it clamps down on all routes into the uk , compromising humanitarian obligations and the needs of the economy . 
  an increasingly unpleasant strain of xenophobia colours the debate , exacerbated by ministers ' failure to guarantee the rights of eu nationals already working in britain , which has led many to conclude that they are no longer welcome . 
   perhaps it is time to step back and reframe the question . 
  the aim of britain 's migration policy should be to ensure that it can attract international talent and help employers recruit the staff they need , provided there is no detriment to uk workers . 
  a work permit system , while incompatible with single market membership , could in theory be a reasonable way to achieve this . 
   however , the current system for admitting skilled workers from outside the eu is restrictive and cumbersome . 
  it imposes a tight cap on the number of visas available . 
  employers must register to sponsor visas -- but the fee and red tape deter small businesses . 
  for most jobs , employers must prove they have tried to find a suitable uk candidate ( a `` resident labour market test '' ) , although this test is waived for jobs on a list of shortage occupations . 
   in addition , there are minimum salary thresholds , hefty application fees and , from next april , a levy on employers of # 1,000 per person per year -- an incentive , as if there were none already , to invest in training british staff instead of hiring migrants . 
  all this is for jobs at graduate level or above , where the economic benefits of migration are clearest and the need to protect uk workers less obvious . 
   far more contentious is low-skilled migration , where the only precedent in uk policy is the short-term sectoral scheme that used to operate for fruit-picking and food processing . 
  it is not clear this model would work in the many areas of the economy -- from construction to care homes -- that currently rely on eu migrants . 
  if , as seems likely , the government institutes a work permit system for recruitment from the eu , it should take a more flexible approach . 
   there should be no attempt to limit work-related migration to a list of shortage occupations or to highly skilled roles . 
  this is a recipe for endless lobbying but is inevitably a subjective judgment . 
  there will never be enough british workers willing to pick strawberries , but do we need british strawberries ? 
  the nhs struggles to recruit nurses , but surely this would change if it offered better pay and progression ? 
   it would be better to introduce a mechanism that made it more costly -- but not punitively so -- for an employer to hire abroad . 
  this could include the resident labour market test , but too often this process forces employers to jump through administrative hoops rather than mirroring a genuine job search . 
   a more effective approach , the independent migration advisory committee argued last year in advice to the home office , is simply to set a higher salary threshold and impose an upfront levy at a flat rate . 
  this serves to skew the system towards high-skilled migration , because the levy generally represents a higher proportion of the salary of a low-skilled worker . 
  it would also raise significant revenues -- helping the government to find the resources needed to train british workers and alleviate pressures on public services . 
   while any work permit system would rule out continued membership of the single market , it would at least give the uk some leverage in negotiations , especially with member states for which low-skilled migration matters . 
  it would also almost certainly result in net migration well above the government 's target . 
  but although ministers equate lower migration with `` the interests of the british people '' , there is no intrinsic virtue in cutting numbers . 
   their rhetoric is , however , doing real damage to the uk 's reputation as a tolerant , open society . 
  there is an urgent need to revisit plans for entirely counterproductive restrictions on international students , to make a commitment to helping child refugees and to combat a worrying rise in hate crime . 
   some have attributed a recent fall in asylum applications to the brexit vote . 
  if even refugees are starting to doubt britain 's attractions , it is hardly a cause for celebration . 
  if the government pursues a `` hard brexit '' at the expense of the economy , the uk may soon hold little attraction for european workers , either .

   mr putin was rattled and angry , but having witnessed the failure of the 1991 coup he knew that tanks were not the answer . 
  instead he trumped civic nationalism with the centuries-old idea of imperial or state nationalism , offering the idea of russia as a besieged fortress . 
  the tactic worked . 
  the protests stopped and mr putin 's personal approval ratings shot up from 60 % to 80 % . 
  by attacking ukraine after its own revolution in 2014 , mr putin persuaded his country and its neighbours that any revolt against the regime would be followed by bloodshed and chaos . 
  ** smoke and mirrors **  the soviet union had many faults , but postmodernism was not one of them . 
  mr putin 's russia is a more slippery construct in which simulation and bluff play a big part . 
  nothing is what it seems . 
  elections are held not to change power but to retain it ; licensed `` opposition '' parties are manufactured by the kremlin ; mr medvedev 's modernisation was an illusion ; doctorates awarded to scores of russian officials , governors and even to mr putin himself were based on plagiarism or cheating , according to dissernet , a grassroots organisation . 
   in 2014 russia put on a remarkable show with the costliest winter olympics ever staged , in sochi on the black sea . 
  the host country 's athletes got the largest number of gold medals , not least thanks to a massive doping operation in which the federal security service ( fsb ) , the kgb 's successor and russia 's main security organisation , swapped urine samples through a hole in the wall between an official laboratory and a secret one next door . 
  ( that caused many russian athletes to be banned from this year 's rio olympics . ), 
  in the same way that russia has been doping its athletes , its state media have been doping the population with military triumphs and anti-american propaganda , conveying an artificial sense of strength . 
  but unlike those sport victories , russian violence in ukraine and syria is real enough . 
   mr putin 's restoration project is working because the disintegration of the soviet union was not complete . 
  the remains of the soviet and even pre-soviet system , its institutions , economic structure and social practices , which lay dormant during the first post-soviet decade , have been revived and strengthened by the current regime . 
   but just as the soviet and pre-soviet legacies can not be erased , nor can the quarter-century since the ussr ceased to exist . 
  the fundamental conflict between a modern lifestyle and the political restoration under mr putin , exposed by the protests of 2011-12 , has been suppressed , not resolved . 
  no restoration has ever ended in a return to the past , and none has been permanent . 
   russia , perhaps more than other countries , advances through generational shifts . 
  the current reactionary phase may turn out to be no more than a detour on the path towards a modern , federalist nation state . 
  or it could lead to further decline , interspersed with outbursts of aggression .
