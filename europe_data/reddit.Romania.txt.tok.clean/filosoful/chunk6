  `` they are people who saw no future for themselves in russia , '' says delfinov . 
  `` middle-class people who just wanted to breathe . ''  berlin is not the only place to have seen a russian surge . 
  london , new york , tel aviv and riga also have big expat communities . 
  but each city has a different kind of immigrant . 
  london attracts the oligarchs , their wives and mistresses . 
  riga , the base of kremlin-critical internet portal meduza , is home to a kind of russian free-press-in-exile . 
  human-rights activists have gravitated towards vilnius , the capital of lithuania . 
   berlin 's russian diaspora is artistic . 
  nowhere else outside moscow and st petersburg boasts so many russian painters , musicians , composers and writers , drawn by the city 's cheap rents and alternative vibe . 
  `` you can swear like a trooper here , worship satan -- all the stuff you ca n't do in russia , '' says delfinov . 
  `` they have pushkin , tolstoy and dostoyevsky -- we have sex , drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll . '' the newcomers also differ from previous waves of immigrants in that they are n't stuck in a russian-speaking ghetto , says georg witte , a professor of slavic studies at berlin 's free university . 
  `` they 're a lot more open to the world . 
  the performers among them , especially the younger ones , get much more mixed audiences . 
  you really feel they 've integrated much better than previous generations . ''  nothing exemplifies that better than the reception given by the german reading public to works by russian-speaking \u00e9migr\u00e9s , some of which have become bestsellers . 
  among the big new names is kiev-born katja petrowskaja , whose holocaust-themed debut novel maybe esther won a top german literary award in 2013 . 
  she is one of a number of young female writers from the former soviet union to have made a mark on german letters . 
   however , the best-known russian writer in berlin is vladimir sorokin , whose bizarre , dystopian novels satirise the repression of putin 's russia . 
  shortlisted for the man booker international prize in 2013 , he is among russia 's most famous contemporary novelists and in germany he is a literary celebrity -- an embodiment of the moscow-berlin cultural axis . 
   sorokin first came to west berlin in 1988 , just before the wall came down , when east german police still patrolled the friedrichstrasse border crossing with alsatian dogs . 
  he recalls the bright lights of the berlin zoo train station , a mercedes sign and a huge billboard showing a busty woman offering cigarettes to a soviet colonel , with the slogan `` test the west '' . 
  `` that 's exactly what we did , '' he laughs . 
  his abiding memory was of being left alone . 
  `` we had come from a state that constantly wanted a piece of you , '' he says in an interview in his home in charlottenburg , old west berlin . 
  `` now we were somewhere that wanted nothing from you at all . ''  sorokin 's admiration for germany was mutual . 
  he signed his first publishing contract in berlin in 1988 , a huge step for a writer whose work had only circulated in samizdat ( the clandestine copying of banned literature ) in his homeland . 
  the german state showered him with fellowships and grants , and in 2011 he bought a flat in berlin . 
  ever since , sorokin has spent half his time here , the rest in a house he and his wife built outside moscow . 
   berlin has proved a somewhat calmer working environment than the russian capital . 
  in 2002 , sorokin was targeted by a pro-putin youth group over his satirical novel blue fat , which features a long and graphic sex scene between stalin and khrushchev . 
  in a rally near the bolshoi theatre , activists tore up his books and threw them into a giant mock toilet : police opened a case against him , later abandoned , for pornography . 
  in 2007 he was injured in a car accident that he is convinced was an attempt to kill him . 
   these days , he tries to avoid moscow . 
  `` it 's more the seat of state power than a real city , a place whose inhabitants are assigned the role of passive ants , '' he says . 
  and he ca n't shake off a feeling that russia is heading for disaster . 
  `` it feels like the titanic , where the floor is shaking , the furniture moving , but people are still sitting in the bar sipping daiquiris . ''  in times of crisis , russians have often made their way to berlin . 
  the largest influx came in the 1920s , as thousands fled a homeland torn apart by revolution and civil war . 
  there were 360,000 russian refugees in berlin in 1921-22 , most of them mired in a life of penury and homesickness , forming what the historian robert williams called a `` community of despair '' . 
   yet the experience was not all grim . 
  berlin quickly emerged as an important centre of russian culture , with 160 russian-language publishing houses which , between 1918 and 1924 , produced more books than their moscow equivalents . 
  berlin became , in the words of one russian poet , the `` stepmother of russian cities '' . 
  some of the great names of 20th-century russian literature , among them vladimir nabokov , maxim gorky and boris pasternak , all spent time in the german capital . 
  in 1922 , one of the first major exhibitions of avant-garde russian art was put on in the galerie van diemen in unter den linden , featuring the works of key modernists such as kazimir malevich and marc chagall . 
   many of the refugees later moved on , settling in paris and prague . 
  but the end of the cold war brought a fresh influx : official figures show that at the end of last year there were 130,135 berliners from the former soviet union -- or about 3.5 per cent of the city 's population . 
   many were economic refugees , or soviet germans drifting back to their ethnic homeland . 
  but after putin became president in 2000 , and russia began to take an authoritarian turn , the exodus became cultural too . 
  among this wave of \u00e9migr\u00e9s was dmitry vrubel . 
  he had first come to berlin in the early 1990s , and on arrival quickly created one of the most striking works of graffiti art on the berlin wall -- a portrait of leonid brezhnev and erich honecker engaged in a passionate kiss , accompanied by the words : `` my god , help me to survive this deadly love . '' ( a recent meme replaces the two old communists with putin and donald trump ) . 
  `` i loved east berlin -- it felt like the soviet union but with freedom and no cops , '' vrubel says . 
   in 2008 he and his wife , the artist victoria timofeeva , moved permanently to a city they say was better suited to their brand of large-scale street art . 
  vrubel says concerns about censorship also played a role : he cites the 2003 case of a religion-themed exhibition in moscow that was ransacked by orthodox christian protesters . 
  the vandals , who smashed and defaced exhibits , were never prosecuted , while the show 's organisers were convicted of incitement to religious hatred , and fined 100,000 roubles ( about # 2,000 ) each . 
  `` two themes have become taboo in russian art -- politics and religion , '' says timofeeva . 
  `` as an artist , how can you work in such conditions ? ''  the 2003 case was a harbinger of what was to come . 
  in 2012 came the jailing of the pussy riot singers and , later , the passage of laws banning `` gay propaganda '' and swearing on stage . 
  `` after 2012 there was a return to traditional values . 
  and that led to self-censorship on a massive scale , '' says sergej newski , an avant-garde russian composer who has split his time between moscow and berlin since the mid-1990s . 
  `` and things got even worse with the war in ukraine . '', 
  if i 'm not mistaken it 's a repost and i hope it will be soon removed , as was the previous one, 
  the full article :  theresa may is about to trigger article 50 of the lisbon treaty , officially informing the eu of the uk 's intention to withdraw . 
  the issue gripping london and brussels is what happens after the british prime minister notifies the bloc of the country 's plans on wednesday march 29 . 
   unless both sides agree on an extension , the uk and the eu have two years to agree a divorce deal before the bloc 's treaties cease to apply to britain . 
   this is the timeline set out in article 50 itself -- 262 words that were scrawled at the kitchen table of john kerr , a veteran uk diplomat , and which will shape the uk 's future . 
   ** march-april 2017 : eu-27 adopt guidelines **  after mrs may activates article 50 on march 29 , the eu will draw up `` guidelines '' on handling britain 's withdrawal . 
  donald tusk , president of the european council of leaders , said this month that the eu can give a first response within 48 hours . 
   but the formal guidelines will need to be endorsed by a summit of the remaining 27 eu countries . 
  such an event could take place in brussels in late april or very early may . 
  either way , some countries are worried about holding a big gathering in between the two rounds of the french election . 
   the guidelines -- which will in part show how hard a line the eu is taking -- are one of the most critical decisions in the brexit process . 
  they are expected to specify priorities for the eu-27 , principles that can not be compromised , and the structure of the talks . 
   ** may-june 2017 : eu-27 agrees negotiating directives **  once the guidelines have been decided , the eu-27 must formally nominate the european commission as its lead negotiator , and develop confidential directives giving the brussels body a more detailed mandate . 
  the commission will make a proposal and the eu will spend roughly four weeks discussing these terms . 
  the mandate must then be approved by eu-27 ministers . 
   no negotiations can take place until this happens . 
  diplomats are pencilling in late may or early june as the moment formal face-to-face talks with the uk can begin . 
   ** may 2017 : great repeal bill begins **  britain will kick off a large part of its preparations with the great repeal bill , a legislative measure set to be outlined in the queen 's speech in may and intended to provide legal continuity for the country after brexit . 
   the bill will repeal the european communities act of 1972 and incorporate eu law into domestic law `` wherever practical '' , so that the government can then begin amending or repealing laws it does not like . 
  it covers thousands of eu regulations that are directly applicable to the uk , but not in uk law . 
  the terms are not active , however , until the uk completes its eu exit . 
   ** 24 september 2017 : germany goes to the polls **  brexit discussions will be well under way by the time germans vote for a new government ( france will have chosen its new president by may 7 ) . 
  the latest german polls show the incumbent angela merkel level pegging with martin schulz , a former president of the european parliament . 
   once a new coalition government is agreed and the german chancellor is installed -- a process that could take weeks -- the cast of europe 's top leaders will be in place . 
  between them , they will decide on what sort of deal , if any , the bloc concludes with the uk . 
   ** december 2017 : divorce talks and trade relations **  michel barnier , the eu 's chief negotiator , wants a `` divorce-first '' approach to negotiations , delaying talks on a future trade deal until britain has agreed principles on an exit bill and the rights of eu migrants . 
  he expects these initial divorce discussions to last until december . 
   the uk government is keen to ensure all elements of brexit are negotiated `` in parallel '' . 
  some eu member states think discussion about future relations could be initiated earlier than december . 
  but an overwhelming majority of eu-27 countries agrees that britain must accept basic principles on the divorce before trade talks begin . 
   ** march 2018 : uk 's deadline for agreeing transition **  after march next year , the value of any transitional deal is greatly reduced , since companies are expected to take early action to protect their interests -- such as relocating activities outside the uk . 
  sir ivan rogers , the former british ambassador to the eu , warned of the importance of a such a deal to avoid falling off a `` cliff edge '' . 
   airlines have warned that the uk must have signed new open skies agreements by this point , because they sell tickets one year in advance . 
   but the eu-27 sees the transition as being the final piece of the negotiation , which can be discussed in detail only once a `` common destination '' is agreed in terms of a future relationship . 
  the eu side also calculates that uncertainty will increase the numbers of companies moving from britain to the eu , reducing the risks to remaining members of the bloc of a hard exit . 
   ** october 2018 : barnier 's deadline to agree deal **  mr barnier said he wants talks wrapped up by october 2018 to allow both sides time to ratify the deal : `` all in all there will be less than 18 months to complete negotiations , '' he said . 
  boris johnson , the uk 's foreign secretary , has said this will be `` absolutely ample '' time in which to conclude an agreement . 
   ** march 2019 : can the article 50 deadline be extended ? 
  **  ratification by eu member states , the european council and the european parliament must have taken place by this point . 
  the uk parliament has also been promised a vote on the deal signed before it takes effect . 
   european parliament elections are planned in may 2019 . 
  this makes it hard to extend the article 50 deadline beyond march without complex legal work , which would deal with the question of whether the uk would elect candidates and what would happen to them .
