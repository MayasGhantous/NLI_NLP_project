  google , apple and a gazillion other companies did n't complain about lack of infrastructure when setting up shop in ireland , amsterdam etc. . 
  being expensive , out of eu and unpredictable for the next half-decade , london becomes less attractive . 
  corporate tax reduction is nothing if you are not in eu , and big companies anyway trickle their money out of eu using netherlands , ireland and other schemes . 
  that 's a marvelous idea , whatever nissan can not sell we 'll just use for police and official cars , that will keep the plant running for a while . 
  when we run out of policemen sans cars , we can just give them for free to landlords so they can visit their properties easier . 
  we keep everyone happy : the ukip workers in sunderland and the tory voters alike . 
  selling non-eu cars in eu is a very difficult undertaking , it 's not just tariffs , but also market share quotas and regulations . 
  even if may gives nissan money , she can not pay for unsold cars made by nissan , essentially paying them to not produce . 
  maybe the government will compensate for the difference between profit and potential profit ? 
  she promised more than money , that is my take from :  group chief carlos ghosn told sunderland plant will have same trade conditions after eu exit  mrs may 's move to reassure nissan , which is partnered with renault , suggests that the uk could negotiate eu access for certain sectors . 
  ministers are looking at whether industries with complex supply chains might be given a carve out and remain in the customs union -- if britain left it . 
   nissan 's concerns around trading barriers extend not only to the export of its cars from the site but access to a european supply chain as well as international talent . 
  you do n't need infrastructure for a `` tax haven '' , and ireland is not a proper tax haven anyway , france corporations also pay ridiculous tax ~ 5 % , ireland is just a gateway to get money out of eu . 
  there is no point to use uk as a corporate hq if it 's not in the eu . 
  you could as well do it in a true tax haven , where not even laws are enforced properly . 
  but ireland is in eu , what 's the point of 0 % tax if you 're not in eu ? 
  for global trade there are already established tax havens , no need for uk . 
  i still do n't understand how may or the british can assure anyone of anything . 
  they keep talking what deal they want from eu , what immigration level , what tariffs and whatnot . 
  but it wo n't be the uk deciding these things with eu just reciprocating . 
  eu is gon na set the baseline of all negotiations and uk will have to please 27 countries in order to get them through . 
  trump is gone in 4 years though , brexit will just begin in 2-3 years and last indefinitely ... 
  is ceta * that * pressing ? 
  2025 is also decent year to approve it . 
  i am joking , but you see my point , when you want/need something in your favor you kindof want it sooner rather than later . 
  edit : plus , we have elections in a couple of months , and while the current pm is not running for office , he might want to seem stronger, 
  where is thia from ? 
  it goes both ways : how about pointing the finger at rich countries buying up all the economy of eastern europe with cheap money . 
  we could have used some safeguards there as well , but we do n't have them because it 's common market . 
  70 % of big businesses in romania are foreign , 5 % of uk 's population is foreign, 
  plus the grid , you ca n't just move 3 times more energy and expect it to work . 
  yeah , we always called it like that, 
   cheaper than we can which is not subject to import duty you get higher subsidies per hectare , see http://capreform.eu/the-distribution-of-cap-payments-by-member-state/ also , your farms rely heavily on ee workers , without them you would n't have the same food prices . 
  edit : and romanian salaries are closer to uk , than to nigerian ones . 
  $ 312 is minimum wage in romania , compared to $ 58 in nigeria and $ 1300 in uk . 
  how do you think people on $ 1300 take home salaries in uk ( which until now it was almost exclusively poor ee people ) can compete with $ 58 salaries ? 
  not sure if this is sarcasm or not ... but you can not do that , unless you want to have 100 % of your agricultural land abandoned and no agriculture whatsoever . 
  european agricultural common policy was bad , but it 's the least worse thing in this world . 
  you can not do agriculture in developed countries without subsidies and trade protectionism . 
  rekt, 
  more like 400 mils :(, 
  we lived together with those traditional muslims ( there are some thousands of them ) for hundreds of years . 
  there is no friction here . 
  people are upset about that mosque because it 's funded by erdogan and seen as an outpost for the new shitty radicalised islamism . 
  especially since erdogan wanted to build ` the largest mosque in europe ' in bucharest , even though there 's just some thousan dmuslims in total . 
  pictures are not doing the landscapes justice , the beauty lies in the almost unspoiled wilderness .

  usually you go with the car to a bed and breakfast close to the objective and from there you take daily hikes . 
  the trails are marked and especially in the mountains it 's better to not take shortcuts , people die each year because of that . 
  each trail is grossly estimated in hours it takes to complete it , so you can choose how much you can make each day . 
  it 's important to get out of the mountains before night sets in , or at least get to a road , otherwise the vampires will get you . 
  you can also camp with a tent , but you must be aware there are bears around , so only do that where other people do it , or ask around if it 's safe to camp . 
  well , we used to have 2 steps forward and 3 steps back . 
  since we stopped electing former communist party leaders as presidents in 2004 , things took a positive outlook . 
  yeah , bad wording . 
  i meant in the sense of big turist attraction cities , like prague or paris or barcelona . 
  i do n't think there are many tourists flying in for the weekend just to visit bucharest . 
  if they do , my bad . 
  nobody is denying the holocaust , but you seem to deny that the british empire did the same thing to others : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_bengal_famine_of_1770 you killed more people than the nazis in camps , but there is no remorse . 
  so the tens of thousands of people that died were just stupid , cause they did n't knew you 're not supposed to die in those , after-all they were not * real * concentration camps . 
  you should visit anyway , it 's a nice country to visit . 
  we do n't have big cities , swiss alps or greece 's beaches , but it 's nice if you like to make tours through the country or trekking . 
  i have yet to meet someone disappointed after visiting romania . 
  then anyone from uk should abstain from making jokes about nazis , you basically invented the concentration camps . 
  https://www.google.com/search?q=boer+war+concentration+camps&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiu46zv58ppahxggr4khxxrdtoq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1540&amp;bih=841 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mau_mau_uprising#human_rights_abuses_in_british_concentration_camps and genocide through famine , ireland and india comes to mind . 
  solar pv actually produced a miracle , imo . 
  in 10 years they went from some exotic option to the cheapest . 
  0.4 $ / w is almost free . 
  i know there are multiple costs multipliers , but if we take just the cells , let 's do some calculation what it takes to cover the 50gw capacity needed by uk : * 0.4 $ ... 1 w * 0.4 * 10 ^ 9 ... 1 gw * 0.4 * 250 * 10 ^ 9 ... 250 gw ( i considered a 20 % capacity factor for 50gw need ) * 100 * 10 ^ 9 ... 250gw in the end we get all the capacity we need for cells worth $ 100 billions , then the energy is free for 20 years . 
  when we have to replace the panels , we need 5 billion $ a year - then we have free electricity for all . 
  i know panels and installation can increase the price 4-10 times , but we can work on that . 
  to store the energy we can use the batteries from evs , because those cars are unused 80 % of their time . 
  say each ev has a battery that can produce 100kw , 1 million batteries can then produce 100gw . 
  1 million batteries are not that expensive , 10 billions maybe . 
  i am not working in the industry , but i had the same feeling as you do . 
  but now with the pv prices , i think we have the fix for the energy problem . 
   coal plants are even worse , regardless of them being outside cities as with all poisons , concentration is what matters . 
  we live 100 % of our lives in diesel-smog filled cities . 
  if a mercury + lead spewing power plant is 10 km from the city , that might be already better imo . 
  i do n't know where you are getting these numbers , everywhere people are saying coal plants , even the old ones , are around 30-40 . http://www.brighthubengineering.com/power-plants/72369-compare-the-efficiency-of-different-power-plants/ with chp you can go much much higher , since there is no need for cooling towers , even 94 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aved%c3%b8re_power_station petrol car engines are nowhere near that , and diesel is very bad for our health to be burning them in cities . 
  i would much rather prefer a petrol engines + gradual introduction of evs , even if evs will consume coal energy . 
  an internal combustion engine is around 25 % while a coal plant is 40 % . 
  not to mention that fueling a coal plant is so much more efficient . 
  also , you do n't have to carry the engine all the time with the car , only a smaller electric motor . 
  siemens must be happy though , and they create jobs and exports, 
  imo selling all state assets is a bad idea , you 'll become a colony . 
  i think you would have been better off defaulting ans goinf back to drachmas . 
  in 20 years you would have been back on track . 
  in the meantime investment is severely slowed down by uncertainty . 
  that industry dropped from 800k tonnes to 400k tonnes , sounds sooo scary ; until you realise that it accounts for 0.07 % of uks gdp , of which 0.05 catches and 0.02 fish farms . 
  i love it when the media shows just one sided statistics . 
   i do n't think you what ? 
  bad move comrade , bad move , no more promotion for you , and if you keep it up we 'll have a longer conversation . 
  have you seen my link ? 
  even ee countries are a net benefit overall to the uk finances ( probably because of the high number of well paid highly skilled workers ) . 
  also , there wo n't be a `` mere trade agreement '' before the full one ; that 's like saying when you negotiate for a new job that you demand 3 days a week work , but for now let 's just settle on a yearly salary ( `` while the things are sorted out '' ) , and we will work out later on how many days i will work each week , with me dictating the number of days according to my needs . 
  you 're missing my point , just like i said . 
  it 's not like the eu will negotiate separately on immigration , then on trade , then on financial services !, 
  like mentioned until now for hundreds of times , it 's all the things together : goods , services , capital , people . 
  uk is delusional if they think that by having the upper hand on movement of people they can dictate the negotiations , or negotiate separately this chapter alone .
