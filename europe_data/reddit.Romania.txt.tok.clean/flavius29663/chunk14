  eu will set the base rules for all chapters and it will go on from there - uk will have to follow the rules because it 's the smaller side . 
  if uk was to only negotiate freedom of movement with eu an entity , then yes , you would have the upper hand . 
  in the current situation , freedom of movement is just another chapter , less important than passporting , goods and capital . 
   young , poor people looking for work i am not poor and i was not looking for work when i came to london , they head-hunted me way before i was thinking to come here . 
  just like me there are a lot of people . 
  you are underestimating the number of highly skilled workers that london gets from europe . 
  nhs alone has 25 % immigrant workers while the national number of immigrants is 5 % . 
  even when you include the low skilled workers , eastern europe immigrants contribute with taxes more than they take out . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/c49043a8-6447-11e4-b219-00144feabdc0 https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study the claim that ee is coming to uk for benefits is pure bullshit , i think uk has one of the lowest benefits package . 
  if you go in germany you have way more hand-outs and anyway in general the immigrants from europe are healthy young people contributing to the economy . 
  what i find even more interesting is all their talk about what immigration system they want : point based , free for all , with caps etc. 
  without ever taking into consideration that the eu wo n't accept and merely reciprocate whatever deal uk decides it 's best . 
  uk is the junior side on this negotiation and will have to take what is offered , not the other way around . 
  ~ ~ nigel farage himself rushed to the german embassy to get passports for his kids . 
  i am not even joking . ~ ~ i ca n't find a source , must have been only the speculations . 
  proof that you become more successful if you switch to latin . 
  you can do it too . 
  it would be in their immediate interest , with billions pouring each year into the country . 
  typical romanian problems . 
  but hey , this attitude got us good internet so there 's that . 
  in ee we at least knew our brains are under attack and tried to resist . 
  that 's not true !, 
  there are so many romanians around in london , italy , spain etc. 
  but because they blend in like normal people people do n't notice them . 
  we are at least 3 mil romanians in western europe . 
  gypsies are a small minority . 
  yeah , literally stay at home , waiting for benefits , some millions of them . 
  i do n't think so no , the romania empire pre-dates with 1300-1500 years the modern state of romania https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_empire . 
  ` romania ' was also used for the entirety of the romance speaking population ( in the world ) . 
  romanians always called themselves `` rom\u00e2n '' or `` rum\u00e2n '' since the first written records . 
  the 3 romanian medieval states were called '' \u021aara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 '' ( romanian country ) , moldova and transilvania . 
  when the modern state was formed by union between '' \u021aara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 '' and moldova , they came up with the name `` rom\u00e2nia '' in around 1860s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania#etymology even now we call our country rom\u00e2nia , but the byzantine empire could be called romania by historians . 
  i think romania name for the empire fell out of use when the modern country of rom\u00e2nia started to use the name . 
  i am not a scholar , so feel free to enlighten me if this is not the case , 
  it 's not about scaring , they have to be active as well in the mountains to run after the wolfs and bears . 
  otherwise large dogs tend to be lazy . 
  the romanian sheepdogs are extremely active and will hunt and kill anything that moves in their path . 
  the parliament even tried to introduce a regulation against them to protect the wildlife . 
  i heard the dogs are so ferocious and well organized by the alpha female that they can go alone in the woods and hunt for boars all by themselves , hear that / u/mistretzu ? 
  yeah , and israel as well ( they are in eurovision anyway - so it 's half integrated ) http://www.romanity.org/friesian/im/rome2c.gif, 
  romanian empire was sometimes used for the eastern roman empire , the bizantine empire, 
   you can expect some unexpected things to happen ( you just do n't know what they are ) and make general plans around the effects during good times . 
  yeah , with `` responsible-politicians '' , if you see any of those , send them over . 
  i would rather have the idiots in power steal 30 % of my economies and salary than tank the entire country like in greece . 
  ah , cool . 
  i saw something in the news , but i thought the plastic 5 note was just some limited anniversary edition . 
  yeah , i just washed 60 pounds and while they are not completely lost , the queen does n't look like she 's feeling well . 
  back at home you would just have cleaner , better money , 
  why do n't you build more factories in the south ? 
  that will for sure drive some gypsies away , they ca n't take the risk of too close to a stable job . 
  anything is easier if the economy goes well , or at personal level : if you have money . 
  romanians still flock italy + spain despite the economy being in a bad shape , i do n't even want to imagine what it would be like if their economies continued like before 2000 : i guess half the country would be there . 
  there were millions of romanians in italy + spain even before we had the legal right to work . 
  anyway , congrats for finding your place !, 
  well , the unexpected can happen : nokia goes bust and russia invades ukraine bringing sanctions . 
  in this case , you could have devaluated your currency to help shift exports to other markets and other goods . 
  but you ca n't because you have the euro . 
  eurozone without a stronger fiscal union or in any case a much closer union does not make any sense : it will always be good for some and bad for some , without mechanisms to balance these out . 
  it 's easy to integrate in latin southern countries : same kind of people , nice weather , very easy to learn the language . 
  it 's not so easy for a romanian to settle in germany , even if he goes there - i know lots of people coming back , but in spain/italy ... it 's like second home , hard to leave  edit : the ones with degrees and high-paying jobs do prefer northern europe , but they can not be in such big numbers anyway . 
  roughly 1 mil italy , 1 mil spain and 1 mil other eu . 
  we always had lei , ever since romania was formed . 
  in 2005 we just knocked off 4 zeroes because it was becoming ridiculous : a bread was 30 thousands , a normal salary was 10 million and the gross domestic product was 4000000000000000 ( 4000 thousand billions - thousands billions was how we expressed our national numbers ) . 
  we got to the point where software was having issue with such big numbers , a sort of 2000 bug for us . 
  the things got simplified a lot after we cut 4 zeros , no inflation or any economic downside to it . 
  even the notes were `` identical '' to the old ones , except it wrote 5 instead of 50000 . https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/rol_50000_1996_obverse.jpg/400px-rol_50000_1996_obverse.jpg http://monede.stfp.net/bancnote/imagini/ro118.jpg btw , we have plastic money , which are the best in the world !, 
  now people did n't completely switch to the new values : - everything under 100 lei is their current value : a bread is 3 lei , a movie ticket is 20 lei , diesel is 6 lei etc. 
  - small salary or pension is is old money : 6 million for a small pension , 15 million for a factory salary - euro equivalent for anything bigger than 2000 lei or apartments/rents : a car is 2-10 thousands euros , rent in 250 euros , an apartment is 30-100 thousand euros , a medium salary is 500 euros , a good salary is 2500 euros . 
  we advertise the price in euros , we negociate in euros , but we pay in lei at the current official exchange rate http://www.olx.ro/imobiliare/apartamente-garsoniere-de-inchiriat/cluj-napoca/, 
  our currency is also de-facto pegged , it stayed almost identical for the last 6 years . 
  the problem is not that , we need to be able to devalue our currency when we hit a crisis . 
  people like to think that the only reason greece is in trouble is because they are lazy and corrupt , but it 's not just that . 
  finland is also suffering , and they can not devalue their currency to get competitive again . 
  we lost 30 % of the currency during the 2010 crash , and it was hard , but we got well quickly enough to become again a growing economy , almost the biggest growths in europe . 
  good , next target should be 2101, 
  switzerland has free movement for eu people , 25 % of it 's workers are immigrants , compared to 5 % for uk . 
  they are also in schengen and they like that ( because of all the cargo going through their country ) , so there it goes the ` border control ' . 
  considering these are the only 2 points kamal addresses , he failed to explain how switzerland can help uk in the fight with `` eu bureaucrats '', 
  i bet that the romanian corruption costs us less than all the tax evasion done with the help of ireland , netherlands etc. 
  to be honest they get quite careful these days , but they still get convictions even if they never touch the money and never sign anything with their own name . 
  we have our own version of rico https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racketeer_influenced_and_corrupt_organizations_act where the party leader was convicted just because the party received illegal money https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adrian_n%c4%83stase#corruption_trial.2c_sentence_and_attempted_suicide, 
  that small number is not even filled in most cases , fyi . 
  they have it for high schools as well , same story . 
  the muslim woman wanted that the hairdresser evacuates all men before she removes her niqab for the hair to be cut . 
  it 's getting late and i have to go to work tomorrow , but this is quite common knowledge . 
  look how the demographics of a normal city looks like when magyarization starts to kick in : from 21 % romanians in 1850 down to 14 % in 1910 . 
  all while transilvania had a 53 % romanian majority overall . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cluj-napoca#demographics even those 53 % numbers i do n't trust very much , being done by hungarians . 
  either way , after union with romania ( after 1920 ) , the romanian peasants from the nearby villages were allowed to move to city so the proportion changed rapidly , even before industrialization , the romanians grew up to 34 % before wwii . 
  magyarization was akin to apartheid in transilvania , the majority of population was forbidden to even move to cities . 
  even the saxons rejected the hungarian way , fought against a union of transilvania with hungary in 1848 and publicly express their will for the union with romania in 1918 . 
  moldova did , it did n't work either, 
  true , the intention in occupying hungary was not to actually annex the territory . 
  is it me or you missed the 1919 occupation of eastern hungary and budapest ? 
  after all , you included odessa in 1941 . 
  so they went from literally calling hungarians nazis for not allowing the refugees get into austria exactly 1 year ago : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-iduskcn0rc0gl20150913  `` sticking refugees in trains and sending them somewhere completely different to where they think they 're going reminds us of the darkest chapter of our continent 's history , '' he said . 
   on sept. 3 , migrants boarded a train in budapest in the belief that they were heading to the border with austria but the train was stopped 35 km ( 22 miles ) west of the capital in the town of bicske , where hungary has a camp for asylum seekers . 
  to saying that ( from current article ) :  austria 's interior minister threatened on wednesday to sue hungary if it refused to take back migrants crossing their shared border , in an escalation of tensions over immigration ahead of next month 's presidential election . 
  oh wow , the disparity is even bigger in romania , i thought it would be similar for you . 
  in bucharest it 's 20000 $ , with developed counties ( includes villages - 50 % of population ) at over 10k euros .
