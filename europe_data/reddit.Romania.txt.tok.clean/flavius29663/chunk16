  after he ended his last term in 2014 , he started spewing stupidity in public , probably for some electoral calculations and also not having top notch advisors anymore . 
  do you have any idea why nowadays when romanians can legally work in spain they accept to not have a contract and be paid each month ? 
  is it just because they got used to working like this , without paying taxes , or is there something else ? 
  typical smug response . 
  uk wants to limit immigration to protect local jobs and wages , if romania would want to limit uk companies to protect local companies , that 's unconceivable in the meantime , immigrants are 5 % of the uk , not all eastern europeans , while 70 % of top 100 romanian businesses are foreign owned . 
  there is a reason common market includes all the 4 liberties . 
   your own spiteful pettiness i mean . 
  i was only showing you the other side of the story . 
  the brits are the ones who believe they are so special we will resign all our rights just to keep them happy . 
  same here , but ` macese ' jam is so delicious ... 
  it 's no wonder . 
  what about british companies doing business freely in the east ? 
  should we also go on tour in the uk and talk about prohibitive measures against gsk , aviva , vodafone and countless others ? 
  i think we should limit their operating income to 1 million $ per subsidiary , so we give a chance to local companies as well . 
  in the end , 1 million is a huge sum is n't it ? 
  there is an error , they ca n't be behind romania at population density . 
  they are both more populous and have less area . 
  it 's the same in romania , more or less , i do n't know exactly the conditions . 
  but believe me , i 've seen more homeless in london ( british ) than in romania . 
  oh wow , there are no homeless in the west ? 
  do you actually believe this shit ? 
  fun fact : the guy on the note is iorga , it 's the romanian spelling of the greek george . 
  you pronounce it like your george but without the os ( say a instead of os ), 
  my comment was pretty obviously made to underline that the british no longer have a big influence made possible by the empire . 
  therefore they wo n't be able to have the cake and eat it like they did for centuries in relation with europe . 
  mentioning that uk still has some rocks here and there does n't change anything , it just shows that some people still miss the good old days of glory ( enslaving nations that is ) . 
  we do n't see the french bloating about their remnants of the colonies ( they also have a lot ) , if they did i am sure they would be downvoted as well . 
  so was the british empire . 
  do you see any british empires around ? 
  they can do whatever they please in their borders . 
  moldova , georgia an ukraine showed us that they like other borders as well , hence the desire of all it 's western neighbors to get in nato to feel safer . 
  we all invited and welcomed the americans , no one welcomed the russians . 
  btw , moldova invasion happened before the nato expansion . 
  nice sunny skies , nice sunny girls , cheap booze , what 's wrong with going in chisin\u00e3u or tiraspol as a student ? 
  i did n't want to make it sound cheap  i just tried to give a sense of what it costs and what 1000 a month buys you . 
  a meal is definitely 10 + at a good place if you do n't take the daily menu , you were n't ripped off . 
  but even good restaurants offer a lunch daily menu ( at least in cluj ) and it 's 16-20 lei . 
   also , 3 camere = 2 bedroom . 
  yep , i forgot to transform from romanian counting where all rooms are counted together . 
  with 1k you live like a king in a nice city ( but then you do n't save ) : 3 bedroom rent near a city center is 350 euros . 
  eating at a restaurant ( 2 course daily menu ) once a day for one person is 4-5 euros = 150 a month . 
  any regular taxi ride is up to 5 euros . 
  a beer in the pub is 1-2 euros . 
  if you think of saving , in a top city you need 80k to buy a 3 bedroom : http://olx.ro/imobiliare/apartamente-garsoniere-de-vanzare/q-cluj/?search%5bfilter_float_m%3afrom%5d=70&amp;page=8 you can also buy in a suburb with 40k , but then you commute one hour each way with your car for a distance of 15 km . 
  if you don ' go in a top city ( but with so-so prospects ) , you can buy a 3 bedroom apartment with 60k http://olx.ro/imobiliare/apartamente-garsoniere-de-vanzare/q-tg-mures/?search%5bfilter_float_m%3afrom%5d=70 a cheap city is 30k for 3 bedrooms http://olx.ro/imobiliare/apartamente-garsoniere-de-vanzare/q-aiud/?search[filter_float_m%3afrom]=70 in a village ( 40 % or romania is rural ) , you can buy a house and 1000 sq meters garden with 10-100k depending on how close it is to a city and the condition it 's in . 
  by top city i meant cluj-napoca , second in size in romania , in top 20 in europe as quality of life . 
  ~ ~ i do n't get this , is it supposed to be a joke or is it for real ? ~ ~ nevermind , they have such a camera in several stations , you even have a printer friendly version of the list of cameras ??!??? 
  it 's after taxes , as jobs in romania are always negotiated in after tax value . 
  your 30k/pa comes down to 2096/month , so 250 under . 
  they also get free housing and transportation , but have to work 200 + hours per month . 
  i am not saying it 's a good paying job , just making some clarifications . 
  yeah , the experts got it wrong with euro and 2008 crisis , i 'm never gon na trust one again . 
  there were studies showing that brexit actually caused an increase support for the eu in the 27 . 
  yeah , we should have more lessons in school about this , otherwise we jump from one extreme to another : `` we did n't kill no jews '' to `` we were literally hitler '' . 
  i am not very knowledgeable myself , but the situation seems more nuanced than let 's say germany , and definitely different . 
  we had a lot of anti-semitism even at high ranks , but this was not put in practice like in germany . 
  even antonescu is more nuanced than hitler or mussolini , he was not a fascist . 
  while he did allow/orchestrate the killing of jews and was a dictator , he only got the far-right ( legionaries ) in the government in order to contain them , hence the armed rebellion in 1941 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_guard#failure_and_destruction as for public opinion on the iasi pogrom , antonescu himself publicly shamed the army for what happened and ordered `` investigations '' , it 's not very clear how much he was involved in that . 
  of course , he also gave contradicting orders regarding the jews and their elimination from romania . 
  do n't forget that this happened around 28 june 1941 , a week after the war in the east started . 
  i think some people in the army and administration wanted to start fixing the jew problem given the opportunity of war , but this was never carried out in full and the situation of jews kept changing ( for the better ) as the war progressed and german defeat became a possibility https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_antonescu#ideology unfortunately i ca n't find again the list of public reactions to what happened , but i am sure i 've seen it somewhere . 
  it 's hard to find real stuff among so many neo-legionaire websites which i wo n't link here . 
  the germans did know the jews were taken to ghettos and then deported , they all magically disappeared but did n't care to know where or how . 
  it 's not the case in proper-romania , where these things never happened en-masse . 
  these initial killings organized by the army were met with public opposition and therefore stopped , the high figures even ordered investigations against the perpetrators ( of course they did n't find anyone guilty , but to appease the public ) . 
  being anti-semitic and proceeding to kill jews are 2 different things , hell i think even now a lot of romanians are anti-semitic , but you do n't see any killings do you ? 
  we had some initial tough laws against the jews , even sooner than germany , but thankfully we stopped there . 
  unfortunately the army had no checks and balances in the occupied territories and had a mostly free hand to do as they pleased . 
  even there , you have for example the romanian appointed mayor of odessa saving thousands of jews after the 1941 explosion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gherman_p%c3%a2ntea#odessa_massacre https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/masacrul_de_la_odesa#masacrul_din_noiembrie_1941, 
  the jews in proper romania mostly survived , there were isolated cases of pogroms against them ( 15k deaths ) . 
  in the occupied territories to the east the army proceeded with jew killings , in the hundreds of thousands . 
  after the war , jews from romania emigrated to israel to become the second largest source of jews after russia http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/immigration/immigration_by_country.html . 
  you make it seem like the iasi pogrom caused all those victims , which is not true . 
  there were some pogroms ( iasi being the largest ) in proper romania , but they stopped because the population was appalled by the crimes - so the total count is 10-15k people . 
  the large number of victims were in the army controlled areas of occupation , where the general romanian population could n't see what is going on and the count is not so easy to make . 
  we were fully functioning in 1989 . 
  not a full democracy , but the state was functioning , it was not crumbling . 
  and retreating from iraq before it was a fully functional state was an even bigger mistake imo, 
  careful when you walk at night , you might fall in a manhole because they stole the cover . 
  in cluj they are replacing them all with plastic ones . 
  i was only referring to the pound and house values ( which represents the biggest wealth for most people ) . 
  i did n't mention ftse , but now that you did : during the 2008 crisis the markets kept going down for a year after the event , so i would expect the same to happen now after article 50 is invoked and companies start to leave . 
  considering the outlook for uk is now negative ( as per rating agencies ) and the government is considering a reduction in corporate tax , these are all signs that companies are starting to move out . 
  how much did every household lost by gbp going -10 % ? 
  how many pensions were reduced ? 
  how much in house values ? 
  and this is just the beginning , the slowdown in the next years would make -4000 a nice to have , it 's gon na be worse . 
  this added no explanation what so ever other than italy is a bad student ? 
  british companies get in return freedom to do business . 
  it is not always so simple you know ? 
  : * in china you can not start a medium/big business unless you make a join venture with a chinese company . 
  * you usually can not buy farmland or buildings in most foreign countries unless you do it through some locals/corruption . 
  40 % of romanians farmland is worked by foreigners * western companies are allowed to buy and out-compete young and small local businesses in the east , thus leaving them with no protection against big sharks . 
  for example you can not do that in russia , where your company can easily be raided by authorities at the order of an oligarch . 
   europeans get this `` benefit '' and not africans check the visa fees for nigeria , as an example https://portal.immigration.gov.ng/pages/visaguidelines, 
   knows cocaine prices at street values  knows where most cocaine was destined from that shipment checks username ... now it starts to make sense, 
  maybe we can print our own plastic euros ? 
  soon everyone will see they are superior and use them . 
  euro and hard working low pay immigrants from the east , i would say . 
  uk was called the sick man before entering ec in 73 , their economy is much better ever since .
