  roma https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people and romanian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians 2 different ethnicity , ~ 5 % of population in romania is gypsy , and out of all gypsies , 5-10 % are from romania . 
  but you have to compound this with the pound devaluation , ftse loses more because of that , while euro based ones are not that bad, 
  why do you think this is a one-sided deal ? 
  romania pays a lot for eu , just not in cash : all the old factories have been sold for pennies , all the biggest companies had to be sold to western companies , including monopolies ( biggest bank , biggest oil companies , telecom , electricity , gas etc. ), 
  - all in the name of making the economy competitive before joining eu , all the brain drain and virgin markets for so many industries . 
  british and eu companies were free to do business in romania since 2007 , eating up the local competition before they could get big - but romanians were only allowed to work in the west only since 2014 . 
  romanians now work for foreigners anyway , at home or in eu as immigrants . 
  75 % of the big businesses are foreign owned ( mostly eu ) and 40 % of agricultural land is own by foreigners . 
  all these would not have happened if it was n't for eu . 
  i am not complaining , but you must see there is another face to the discussion . 
  we do n't get a free meal in eu . 
  did you think that germany and uk were accepting poorer countries out of the goodness of their hearts ? 
  it 's business , a win-win situation unless one side tries to get only the benefits but not the costs . 
  as for the cash itself , it 's around 1-2 bln each year , compared to the government budget of 50 bln . 
  a little better money management could easily cover all the pennies . 
  it 's not about the cash itself , the eu money are helping us because these money are notoriously hard to steal , but politicians can not give up on them because of public pressure . 
  with these funds , eu forces the civil servants to clean up and reduce corruption , which far outweighs the cash benefits imo . 
  uk limiting immigration would be the same as romania limiting uk businesses to say 10 millions per company . 
  glaxo glaxosmithkline does 100 millions of business , vodaphone 500 millions etc. 
  we have romanian companies that could replace them , just like you have workers that could replace romanians . 
  do you know that in china it 's hard to build a business unless you make a partnership with a local chinese company ? 
  you wo n't get approvals otherwise . 
  eu makes business easy , but there are flip sides and that is why germany insists that everything is one pack : you can not have common market without free movement . 
  i think this will happen until uk sorts itself . 
  there is no way eu can let itself be blackmailed by uk , after the vote . 
  uk blackmailed eu for 40 years : paying less to the common fund due to the rebates ( 7 bils a year ) , no schenge , no euro , city of london has euro passporting rights etc. 
  it would be hilariously weak from eu to concede to blackmail once again , like some brits suggest around here . 
  1 billion for you , 5-10 billions for them , because it 's based on the size of the economy . 
  brits have a bad time understanding this , while they allow their own parliament to be one of the most unrepresentative . 
  ideally , having to pay for it one way or another : with money or with one hour of community service . 
  if you ca n't or wo n't do that , then your vote does n't matter . 
  this banter leaves me breathless, 
  not even like that : the parliament is directly elected by the people , the council and the commissioners are voted/sent by the national governs . 
  the eu immigrants actually produced more value in the uk than they took out ( including those pesky low level romanians and poles ) . 
  so this means sending them home will hit the economy even further . 
  why do n't the percentages add up to 100 ? 
  edit : i did n't read the fine print , it says right there on the bottom, 
  huh , there goes the 2nd economy of europe and the 5th economy of the world . 
  what referendum are you referring to ? 
  some gypsies stealing copper is hardly organized crime ... 
  there are 200k russians in moldova , around 5 % of the population . 
  it 's hardly `` a large minority '' . 
  they have a big influence because of the past soviet control and corruption , but with the capital in bucharest they would be irrelevant . 
  i bet you a lot of russians will leave anyway , because romania is not such a good * touristic * destination for them . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  here is the data https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_moldova#moldova_under_the_central_government_control_2, 
  they took our anthem as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himni_i_flamurit, 
  you 're switching now from russia to us , so you give in the point . 
  you can say whatever about us , but countries flock to nato and us for their protection against russia . 
  people want to immigrate into us , want to us products and culture , internet , hollywood etc. 
  - call me when you can say the same about russia . 
  yep , russians are just well-doing missunderstood piece keepers and protectors of small nations . 
  who would have thought they only wanted to protect the poor neighbors when they conquered what ? 
  50 nations in the last 700 years . 
  they wanted so much to protect that they ended up being the largest state in the world , go figure . 
  schengen has nothing to do with free movement , it just allows you to cross borders without showing the passport . 
  it does not mean you can stay there and work legally, 
  they also did n't invade georgia !, 
  and they are totally not involved in transnistria !, 
  they confuse schengen with quotas , no need to read further . 
  what were the policemen saying ? 
  at this point i am not sure if it 's missing an / s or not, 
  that is a good idea , have bulgaria invest in a reactor at cernavoda , it 's close enough to bulgaria so they can use the energy and they will move away from dependency on russia for maintenance . 
  hod do you know they are from romania ? 
  i am afraid of that as well . 
  our only hope is eu , we were forced by eu to do this , and the politicians will * have * to continue to do it otherwise they lose funds . 
  luckily we have the mcv on justice in place , i hope they never lift it . 
   stricter laws we have extremely tough laws for these kind of people . 
  the smallest theft will get you at least one year in jail . 
  the second time they are caught it 's more . 
  a lady was doing 2.5 years in prison for picking up flowers from the city parks to sell them on the streets . 
  she was pardoned by the president because she had 6 kids at home . 
  this is one case , but it 's everywhere the same , the punishments for small time crimes are insane in romania . 
  that is why these criminals prefer to have a go at it in the west , where it 's easily forgiven . 
  a pickpocket in barcelona was saying on camera he was caught 14 times and each time he did 3 days in jail then set free . 
  in romania it would have been 1 year minimum for the first one , then 3 + for the next . 
  begging is illegal in romania iirc , you really do n't see beggars in the streets anymore . 
   more funding for education for their children education is free in romania , gypsies also get an easy admission to universities just because of their ethnicity . 
  up to 18 years all kids that go to school receive a small allowance ~ 10 % of the minimum wage . 
  a lot of gypsies used to have 5 + kids just so they have a continuous stream of allowances from the kids , while investing next to none in them and sending the children to school just the bare minimum so the allowance is not cut . 
  i also saw so many of them selling for cash the items that they receive for free from government or various organizations ( stuff for school , basic food etc. ) . 
  as a side note , despite family planning and contraceptives being free , they do n't use that . 
  this is not about the money , it 's a cultural thing . 
  they resisted integration for 700 years , we are dirty for them , * gagii * is how they call us/the others https://ro.wiktionary.org/wiki/gagic%c4%83 . 
  they do n't want to mix with * gagii * and doing so results in disapproval in their community . 
  they are heavily paternal and are always trying to have a parallel society with it 's own laws which they try to shield from the regular rules , justice , police . 
  for most of them trickery and fraud is fair game , even inside their own community - many do not steal at all , but are living from frauds . 
  a favorite quote of theirs is `` water , air and suckers never end '' . 
  the communists forced many of them to live in proper houses inside the general population and give them proper jobs in factories . 
  it did n't work . 
  btw , for a gypsy working 9-5 is the biggest punishment you could give . 
  they are tradesmen by nature , usually traveling trades . 
  they are really good at this kind of stuff http://ziarulceahlaul.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/caldararuneculai-3.jpg and they are good musicians https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2m7qgpjdki i 've seen gypsy taxi drivers , painters and eaves makers , but never one in a stable job . 
  in the modern world it 's hard to survive on itinerant trades anyway , but if you also refuse to integrate you 'll gon na have a hard time . 
  to be honest , i do n't know what the solution is , probably education in a way that ca n't be cheated and faked . 
  this is hard because they are so paternal . 
  if the father says `` go to school to convince the suckers to give you the allowance '' , that kid will never treat the school with respect : it 's just another scheme to trick the * gagii * into giving more money . 
  it 's called perp walk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perp_walk, 
  not all with handcuffs , but at least taken in custody by police nastase http://www.luju.ro/static/images/2012/iulie_2012/25/nastase_cab_bun.jpg cocos http://www.luju.ro/static/images/2014/octombrie_2014/27/cocos_catuse.jpg mircea basescu , president 's brother http://img.spynews.ro/?u=http%3a%2f%2fspynews.ro%2fuploads%2fmodules%2fnews%2f0%2f2014%2f6%2f27%2f36314%2f1403858813e9a4d0e2.jpg&amp;w=636&amp;h=533&amp;c=1 http://www.ancheteonline.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mircea-b%c4%83sescu-p%c4%83strat-%c3%aen-continuare-la%e2%80%a6-%e2%80%9er%c4%83coare%e2%80%9d_01.jpg obreja http://www.evz.ro/image-original-605-388/cache/2014-04/04-obreja-rudel-nd-465x390.jpg olguta http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/186/3927/15182027/1/7372100-mediafax-foto-marian-ilie.jpg vantu http://i0.1616.ro/media/441/2681/33713/14996241/4/61448789.jpg?width=818,
