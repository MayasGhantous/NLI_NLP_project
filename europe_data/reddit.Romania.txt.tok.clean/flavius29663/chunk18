  you missed nastase , voiculescu , vantu , apostu and others, 
  let 's hope us keeps their presence in europe . 
  if we rely on the europeans we are screwed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal, 
  eu immigrants tend to not riot or plot terrorist attacks , especyally the ones from ee , where there are virtually no radical islamists . 
  on the other hand , uk has it 's own brewery of extremists and terrorists that has nothing to do with eu . 
  is n't this the case for it nearshores and industrial factories already ? 
  i thought it 's expected and beneficial for eastern europe to do this kind of work while we raise our wealth . 
  but you do n't understand , uk 's democracy is the only true democracy and ** after ** brexit they will always vote in line with the people 's will . 
  nationalists ? 
  like this ? 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mp3sb/romanian_mayor_wins_second_term_from_prison_no/ or this https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mc8ca/europe_has_over_12_million_slaves_poland_has_the/ both posted by a romanian in the last week ? 
  * taken in due time * , right now no austerity will save greece . 
  romanian , but i think you can read some numbers : http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-finante_banci-12717845-din-top-100-exportatori-96-sunt-companii-straine-relansam-exporturile-sau-exportatorii-10-solutii-concrete-pentru-relansarea-industriei-romanesti.htm  75 % of big industry is foreign  96 out of top 100 exporters are foreign companies when saying foreign companies it 's usually eu , very few are from us , japan or china . 
  western companies were allowed to buy the privatized local companies for pennies . 
  even more , they were allowed to freely enter a young market ( 10 years ) where successful local startups and medium companies could not compete with established corporations and were bought out or replaced . 
  biggest oil producer sold to austrians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrom#privatization_controversy national telecom sold to greeks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romtelecom energy company sold to eon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e.on_gaz_romania biggest bank bcr ( 30 % market share ) sold to austrians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banca_comercial%c4%83_rom%c3%a2n%c4%83 dacia sold to renault https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia#acquisition_by_renault the examples go on and on , there are so few big companies left with romanian capital , it 's actually hard for me to name companies that are still romanian . 
  yep , or russia , very sovereign , they * so reign * over others in fact . 
  all the lands belong to them , all the oil is extracted by their own oligarchs , not foreign ones , but the money will end up in london anyway . 
  i for one am happy with the current win-win arrangement , i was just pointing out that poor countries do n't get a free meal , in romania 75 % of all the big business is foreign and 40 % of arable land is worked by foreign as well . 
  also , the brain drain is drastic for all of ee . 
  it beat china in the last report, 
  yeah , rich countries had the right to enter a virgin territory for the business and take over younger and smaller companies , owning large chunks of economy in the poorer states . 
  also land is now free to buy by foreigners . 
  lol , russia was never peaceful , except when it was bankrupt like in the nineties . 
  nato was not expanding in 1992 ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war, 
  yeah , definitely worth a visit if you are in the area . 
  i think it 's one of the places that awe you in person as well as in pictures . 
  all these posts with `` thing you see only in _____ '' are usually stuff that you see in any country , depending how much you search for it . 
  it 's like there are rednecks and sloppy workers all around the world , who would have thought ? 
   my step-father spent some six months in prison during the ceausescu era but was it for political reasons ? 
  he actually gave a pardon to the political prisoners is n't it ? 
  after 1965 if you were a political dissident they would scare you , beat you , harass you , make your life miserable - but you were n't taken to prison anymore . 
  none of the aforementioned clashes would be solved by leaving eu, 
  so it 's a watered down helicopter then ? 
  yeah , and it 's all because of eu , they are the ones that pushed for stronger anti-corruption before we were even allowed in the club . 
  even now we still have the mcv on justice . 
   the face veil is not considered traditional dress for bulgaria 's muslims , who make up 10 % of the country 's 7.1 million population . 
   ramiz sali , former head of the muslim board in pazardjik , who now works at the city 's 350-year-old ottoman mosque , said that he did n't care whether a woman covered her face or not , but that islam only required that she wore a headscarf . 
  then this guy comes along :  the community has been at the centre of controversy and media attention after one of its preachers , ahmed musa , was put on trial three times for spreading `` religious hatred '' . 
  locals say musa was born christian but 20 years ago converted to islam ; he adopted more conservative views after travelling to the west . 
  it looks to me like a western radicalized preacher tries to bring salafist rules to muslims that they did n't even had for 700 years . 
  given everything what optionplus said , it 's weird to be last . 
  i am not saying we should be among the top , but not dead last . 
  you seem to be terribly confused about who is who , where it is and if it 's in eu . 
  the difference is that italy and germany are decentralized , because their countries got united after the industrial revolution . 
  uk and france on the other hand are examples where industrial revolution happened after the country was established and therefore most of their economy is around london and paris . 
  romania was centralized around bucharest in the communism years , so it 's more akin to uk and france rather than germany . 
  but this is a changing trend , i feel like sibiu , cluj , brasov and timisoara are slowly becoming major cities that are not eclipsed so much by bucharest . 
  edit : as halcyonred said below , the prices are probably driven by low construction rate, 
  the guy is a gonner , no point in arguing with him . 
  he 's banned from / r/romania, 
  it 's not so simple really . 
  like lakeseaside said above , everything is connected . 
  imagine there are 800k polish in uk now , taking british jobs . 
  but they also pay 500k rents ( to british ) , they need to feed themselves and buy cars etc. 
  all this movement of money from one hand to another is increasing gdp and creates additional jobs . 
  what matters in the end is that each person should constantly evolve to get higher positions and salaries , otherwise they get left behind by inflation , immigrants , automatization , digitalization . 
  even with zero immigrants the low skill workers and the ones that do n't evolve are screwed anyway . 
  well not really , when you steal 1 million and also do n't pay taxes on it it 's double the prejudice . 
  anyway , regarding the panama papers , i do n't get how politicians can be millionaires from their salary . 
  the reason politicians hid the fortunes there is because they were illegal money to start with . 
   120000 * 100 is about 20 % of the population of the uk ... . 
  yes , which is what i assumed to be the total immigrants number , i did n't find good sources on that . 
  make it 2 % of all the immigrants , my point still stands . 
  i am sorry your wife has to work with this kind of people . 
   things that should n't really be happening with an integrated people let me guess , most of them are gypsies . 
  that 's the issue really , we had gypsies for 800 years and they did n't integrate . 
  between 2-5 % of romanians are gypsies but they lower the standard so much for everybody else . 
  we even got slaps on the wrists before 2004 for `` discriminating '' against them . 
   i 'm talking sexism , racism yeah , this is bad in eastern europe in general , i still do n't get why romanians get so much heat for this compared to slovaks for example . 
  it 's the same over there , i would personally say they are more racist and sexist than us . 
   just that people tend not to like it when they walk around a city centre in a place where they have lived their whole lives and never hear their own language working romanians tend to integrate rather seamlessly and because of that you only see the thieves and beggars and because of media , all of these are now labelled romanians . 
  and why are romanians singled out for this , or ee in general , when you have women wearing full face veils , women not allowed by their husbands to learn the english language and no-go muslim zones ? 
  still , romanians make the news because it 's easy , it 's not racist . 
  why is it more politically correct to bash an entire nation instead a specific subgroup of citizens ? 
   households see a reduced availability of social housing or higher housing prices what british seem to forget is that because of that same pressure they get to rent their apartments at such high prices . 
  a rent paid so often by immigrants , which end up working their ass off to pay 1000 pounds for a small one bedroom . 
  all these money then goes to a british ( usually ) landlord , who bought the house 30 years ago for 10 % of the price . 
  then he proceeds to go online and complain about immigrants . 
  i 've even met a b&b owner in london complaining there are too many tourists in the city so he ca n't move around !, 
   changed some of the cities ( birmingham and romanians for example ) overnight what do you mean by that ? 
  romanians are at 120000 roughly 1 % of all immigrants . 
  out of the entire uk population , romanians are merely 0.18 % . 
  is this a case where a small minority changed cities overnight ? 
  or a case of media attributing every goddam immigrants problem to romanians . 
  every gypsy , beggar and low life scum is now a romanian . 
  i agree that some people coming from romania are causing problems , but they are a minority , most are hard workers , but you do n't hear about them . 
  eastern europe also paid a lot to the eu : liberalization of market meant that all big businesses could buy old factories for pennies , they could eat up all the small competition in the new countries . 
  in romania for example 75 % of all the big businesses are foreign , 40 % of farm land is owned by foreign . 
  not to mention the brain drain , which impacts the country on the long run . 
  it is a win-win situation , we do n't have a free lunch you know , it 's not like your politicians decided to expand eastwards from the goodness of their hearts . 
  edit : in the meantime , we get ~ 2 billion each year from eu , for an economy sized at ~ 160 so it 's not the main growth factor for us . 
  what helped us was the common market and eu push towards more modern laws , anti-corruption . 
  until 1st jan 2015 regular workers needed a visa for france , but the thieves do n't need visas to operate . 
  i am sure these percentage will go down now that more normal people will also move to france . 
  i was not trying to compare the gravity of the crimes , i was just pointing out that even a dutch crime somehow gets shoved in our yard . 
  the same with immigrant issues and gypsies . 
  all the gypsies are romanian in western news . 
  that is the perfect example , tldr : some romanian abattoirs legally and in good faith butchered and sold horse meat . 
  then some dutch guy passed it through a cyprus offshore to transform it to beef and sold it in western europe .
