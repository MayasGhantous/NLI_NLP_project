  unless you believe that hungarians were kind rulers welcomed with bridges of flowers . 
  turks still believe that the ottoman empire was such a blessing for the occupied balkans . 
  russians still believe that ussr was such a blessing for eastern europe . 
  do you believe that hungarian rulers were such a blessing for the occupied nations ? 
   your nation is also mixed with germans , ruthenes and hungarians your nation is also mixed up with germans , ruthenes and romanians  but that does n't stop them considering themselves hungarian . 
  and btw , romanians were slauthered by the tatars , turks and hungarians and still more than hungarians , so what gives ? 
  no offense op , but this is a political piece by the post . 
   more people died in terrorism-related attacks in russia than any other country in europe , according to the gtd . 
  not including turkey , which definitely has the highest toll http://www.datagraver.com/case/terrorism-attacks-in-turkey-1970-2016 but including war zones and civil wars ... weak political piece imo .

  yes , make your own sea !, 
  and the hungarians lol , they were a minority in their own country , just 48 % muhaha, 
  i do n't get this : why would n't the person in the train just throw the parcels on the ground ? 
  would finish faster too . 
  yeah , but she wants something in exchange for that , cause she has the upper hand . 
  and accepting from now that existing expats can live in uk means that you leave out future movement of persons , which might be a bad footing for future negotiations to the common market . 
   stupid western assessments of the former soviet space . 
  so you care about soviet people feelings about `` their space '' , but not about the lives of millions of people who decided for themselves that they had enough of russia , how kind of you !, 
  he was still very popular in romania and probably would have been elected again today if he only was n't handcuffed and taken to prison http://cutiapandorei.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dan-diaconescu-catuse.jpg he was jailed 5 years for blackmailing small towns ' mayors : pay or be destroyed in his television . 
  from 5 % positive views toward it , to maybe ... 5 % ? 
  hate towards russia is so ingrained here that i ca n't see anything that would make us turn towards them . 
  they still largely control half of moldova , now republic of moldova , and we allied with literally hitler last time when we tried to liberate moldova from russians . 
  he steals , but at least we know him , unlike those young-liberal-westernpaid-hungarianpaid-jewspaid-sorospaid-reptiliens, 
  luckily we still have the mcv , they ca n't do shit, 
  i 've updated the post, 
  you asked for the army ? 
  https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcslglaqep4ffkwkscqnkhrkpte8gxppq8eqtuupvisreleqlmpo no , it 's not photoshop . 
  for good reason , the very next day this happened https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5g534h/hungarian_snub_to_romania_holiday_revives_tension/ imagine uk forbidding it 's diplomats to go to the 4th of july celebrations . 
  hard to know what happenned when it was all orchestrated by russian tourists . 
  the russians are champions of mass deceit . 
  think hitler and goebels won the war and established a tradition of propaganda improved all throughtout the 20th century . 
  i dunno , but it definitely ends at romanian borders , 
  this is the same story as in germany : we lost wwi not because our brave army was bad , but because politicians betrayed us !, 
  in hungary they did n't lose the non hungarian parts because non hungarian population was living there , nono , they lost it because a handful of landlords fuked up . 
  i see no problem in hungarians repeating the rhetoric of fascists , nope , no issue here . 
   in the balkans ffs, 
  yeah , that is what i meant , we got a fairly drawn border . 
  if hungarians in romania were close to the borders it wold have been part of hungary , we did follow the ethnic lines in 1919 . 
  it 's not our fault that the hungarian colonists from the middle ages ended up in the middle of romanians . 
  tell that to brexiteers : http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/665089/brussels-red-tape-cost-eu-brexit-priti-patel http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/29/eu-red-tape-is-suffocating-uk-economy-and-brexit-can-set-us-free/ they did n't realize that red tape means : protection for environment , protection for workers , protection for buyers etc. 
  but they were still happy to vote against their own interest ... even if majority of companies advocated for staying in eu , despite the red tape . 
  it 's mind-blowing . 
  but but ... brussels ' red tape !, 
  oh wow , you are dense . 
  so if a german spends 30k , he must spend it by buying stuff right ? 
  stuff maybe made in ... other countries ? 
  it was up until 2008 that people insisted russia is friendly and will never make wars again . 
  even then , most people tried to ignore the georgian conflict , hoping that it will go away like a bad dream . 
  actually , i think people always preferred to ignore russia in absence of a better response : transnistria war was in 1992 , cecen war started in 94 and ended in 2002 ? 
  ( guerilla war still going on ) and they just brutally leveled cities and killed tens of thousands of civilians . 
   70 % of those 440 million do n't even have as much as 1000 euros in savings that they could spend on `` british '' products and live day to day  when living costs exceed 30 k yearly . 
  so people in europe spend 30k each year , but they do n't spend 1k . 
  can you make up your mind ? 
  do you have reading comprehension issues , that you have to spell out everything ? 
  you missed the essence of my comment where i stated that you basically recycle the petrol , using it once as a packaging in the form of plastic , then you burn it - it 's recycled as it gets recirculated in the industrial process . 
  it 's not possible to recycle it ad infinitum like iron , but doing it once is a step forward . 
  do you want me to spell that out for you ? 
  recycling is a broader notion , check out wiki as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recycling, 
  you are using it twice ... once as a plastic packaging and once as fuel . 
  compared to using it directly as fuel in an inefficient petrol car , i say it 's a big improvement . 
  weird study . 
  i really want to see the methodology now . 
  romanians do elect strong leaders , but prefer reason when they have a choice : in 2014 we elected the most unappealing ( as in not making promises ) and non-orathoric president of all times . 
  it looks like we are doing one of these news every week now . 
  should be alright in general , you will get stares iuou hold hands though . 
  the only ones willing to be aggresive might be the local chavs if they are drunk , but is n't this the case everywhere ? 
  not to mention the most jailed journalists in europe , now it 's said they even surpassed china in this regard . 
  i am sorry , but they seem to belong in russia , asia , middle east , north africa type of family , not european . 
   dig themselves out i feel you, 
  you 're delusional https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:grc:usa:ita&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:grc:deu:cze&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false, 
  the russians get much more for the same amount of moeny . 
  nato also has a lot of duplication , probabli 0,5 of gdp is spent on high commands and pencil pushers on average . 
  while as a whole eu nato members could defeat russia in a conventional conflict , it 's not sure . 
  we want peace , not war , so putting the money where the mouth is shows russia that eu is serious about defending its members and detter an aggression . 
  you 're spot on !, 
  that 's why in the nato summit held in uk after ukraine invasion they decided to bump the expediture by new acquisitions mainly , not maintenance or salaries . 
  so that 's why we have hormets around til, 
   france had a defensive strategy that is not what was agreed before germany declared war . 
  they were supposed to attack germany in the back and throw it out of war because it could not sustain a war on 2 fronts at the time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-polish_military_alliance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal#1939  maginot line anyone france and uk had more tanks than all of wermacht . 
  despite being under immense pressure from the germans , the romanians actually keep their end of the deal with the attacked poland in 1939 and gave full support to allow the evacuation of the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_bridgehead french and british forces declared war on paper and did nothing , they could have stopped the world war right then in 1939 . 
  then romania got chopped off by russia and germany , being forced into the damn war trying to get the country whole again . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award only after these , romania attacked russia together with germany . 
  what ? 
  lol no . 
  everyone knew that clinton is a crook but we also know what happens when fascist populist type of leader come into power . 
  we went through 1930s and we do n't want that again , you did n't have that and you seem happy to repeat our mistakes . 
  yeah , i for one do n't imagine russia going full war against nato states . 
  even if you win you ca n't do much against a population that despises russia , as it was proven in ee during 45-89 . 
  but !, 
  what russia is doing it 's trying to destabilize our countries to create a so called buffer-zone , disregarding the will and the well-being of those populations . 
  even when russia used military they did n't go full war , they preferred a frozen conflict : transnistria , georgia , ukraine . 
  these countries are now forever destabilized : moldova can not into eu , nato or romania and transnistria can not into russia . 
  it 's a limbo state at the moment , exactly what russia seems to want . 
  this is much more suitable for russian interests rather than a full blown occupation , which is very expensive . 
  they learned their lesson in afganistan and cecenia , full blown wars are expensive , make bad publicity and it 's really hard to win from them . 
  we invited the americans to come over . 
  nobody invited russia but they still go where they please .
