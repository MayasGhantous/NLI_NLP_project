  with 3g and 4g you get internet everywhere in romania , i was streaming music while crossing the wilderness . 
  it is also cheap , with 6 $ you get 2gb of unlimited speed traffic and virtually free calls . 
  internet coverage is not an issue anymore , but household penetration is , lots of older people never used a computer . 
  not sure if you know what ironic means , or you do n't know the full story of this ? 
  no , they take money from any card , who would have guessed ? 
  93 % 1.55 , dammit balkans, 
  most romanians are not aggressive beggars or sleeping rough on the streets , but are hard working members of their new society . 
  in hindsight , we also wonder what if we waited a couple more years . 
  there are 2 sides for this : an early admission meant less pressure to reforms for our corrupt politicians . 
  they would n't have changed much , but they were forced by the eu , and they had to listen to eu because of people 's support for integration ( 80-90 % ) - after 2007 the pressure on politicians was dropped from infernal to mild . 
  on the other hand , we got in and improved our economy very fast after that ; now it 's easier to make reforms , because we have more money and people have more know-how . 
  all in all , considering also the eastern threat , i think it was a good decision to integrate sooner than later . 
  use the romanian-programmers layout , it does n't change anything , if you want \u0103 you press right alt + a , \u00ce - alt-i and so on , very easy . 
  the best internet and the cheapest , romania stronk ; 8 euros for 200 mbps . 
  the downside is that the poles look like a jungle because of all the fiber cables : http://ziuadecj.realitatea.net/images/articole/00117236/00095814_large.jpg , only now we are starting to put them underground . 
  if ugly cables are the price to pay for cheap internet , i say go for it , 
  they are both mps http://www.senat.ro/fisasenator.aspx?parlamentarid=1a3f2bbd-f43a-4ebf-b032-acad447c6d82 and http://www.cameradeputatilor.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=154&amp;cam=1&amp;leg=2012&amp;pag=1&amp;idl=1 and former ministers ( v\u00e2lcov - finance , \u0218ova - big projects ), 
  in romania , mps can be prosecuted , but a parliament vote is needed to arrest them . 
  today , ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ 3 arrests were requested , one passed ( darius v\u00e2lcov , the finance minister up to one week ago - the one with the renoir and gold ingots http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/24/us-romania-corruption-iduskbn0mk16220150324 ) and one failed ( dan \u0218ova , former `` big projects '' minister , right hand of the current prime minister ) . 
  no belgium cities ? 
  wtf ? 
  and no luxembourg ... 
  til, 
  good point , forgot about those, 
  just that attila was not really hungarian , though related https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huns#claims_of_hunnic_origins, 
  we tried that , they did n't like it too much , not our fault https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian%e2%80%93romanian_war#the_romanians_occupy_budapest, 
  yeah , drive out of romania as fast as possible . 
  why not take the plane though ? 
  as allies advanced , all countries switched sides , e.g. 
  hungary tried to do the same but were occupied instead by the germans https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_margarethe, 
  i think the title is wrong , freedom of movement is not limited to schengen , it also includes romania , bulgaria , uk and ireland which are not schengen . 
  not cool , good thing you took it down, 
  he could n't even win democratic primaries , meaning he failed to get 25 % support from total voters . 
  similar score with national of marine le pen is n't it ? 
  unlike in france , bernie can go up or down , so we do n't know yet . 
  my guess is that we have a little bit of all , if you look at the first link we have equal proportion of red ( western ) , yellow ( russian , slavic ) , blue ( blakanic ) and green ( southern ) . 
  the only ones that are missing is light green and violet , from the north . 
  yeah , going to britain is easy because of the language , or for romanians going to italy and spain , but it 's not so easy to go from italy to nederlands as for someone in kansas going to new york, 
  it 's like guam for us : not sure if it 's westmost or eastmost point of the country . 
  plus you can police in migs , not sure about trainers . 
   portupoor  super-poor you really enjoy this , are n't you cartman ? 
  are n't they all ? 
  oh i am sorry , i though we are in the generalization of nations thread . 
  i 'll see myself out . 
  so if you did n't have a say then , what makes you think you 'll have a say after brexit ? 
  you 'll have even less `` say '' because your politicians wo n't have to cooperate with anyone except torries with labour . 
   indeed . 
  i do n't think there 's anyone , involved in politics , in any country who can say `` i 'm honest '' . 
  ftfy, 
  this is genius , subtle enough that if erdogan buddies complain about it they would have to spell out the joke , muhaha . 
  romanians do n't squat and are not slavs ( as suggested at 0:20 ), 
  no they did n't , they opened up sooner than uk . 
  yeah , but even then the law was archaic , it probably remained so long active because of communism . 
  and today there are discussions about civil union and also gay parades without anyone being stoned or threatened for discussing about it . 
  the world is changing , but some islamists seem to be stuck in the past . 
  this could be true for all the cheap countries around the world , there are many of them , no need for eu . 
  so romania does n't compete only with germany , but also with china , georgia and turkey . 
  unlike china , we have eu regulation , this is a blessing ( for workers , environment , property ) and a curse in the same time ( for corporations ) . 
  as gdp grows , people get higher salaries , some factories are moved further east . 
  it 's not so easy to get more than 3 times the growth of west . 
  when germany goes to 3 % , then we will be able to get 9 % . 
  i am just a layman , so treat this just as an opinion though . 
  well yeah , they should grow quicker , because they have to catch up . 
  and they do , 4 % seems small but it 's 3 times bigger than eu average . 
  luckily we have to respect eu laws , so china or india style of growth is not really possible . 
  i got defensive because i read your comment as : `` you lazy ungrateful kid , i give you lunch money and a roof over your head and you only bring home 4 % '' , 
  all functioning economies are benefitting from eu , i do n't know where this idea is coming from that only poor ones benefit and the rich ones do n't . 
  people forget that 75 % of big businesses in romania are run by western countries ( mostly eu ) , 40 % or large agriculture is done by eu farmers , not to mention brain drain into the west . 
  how is this not benefiting eu rich states beats me . 
  everyone knows and complains about the funds they pour into the east , but these are not the biggest driver of our economies . 
  it 's getting better because of the open market and improvement of public policies made at eu pressure . 
  we get 2-3 billion of net funds each year to an economy of 160bln, 
  it 's not about the total number , the concern is not that they will succeed to impose a gay-banning law in uk . 
  the problem is that half of muslims have these ideas . 
  like ukraine war is now boogeymen instead of green men on vacation ? 
  except people from / r/russia take it seriously, 
  as long as you want to integrate ( not cause trouble ) it will not be an issue to be a russian ethnic in romania . 
  we had these guys for hundreds of years https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipoveni also young russian professionals seem to like living in romania . 
  miss std , their youth organization is called tsd ( tineretul social democrat ), 
  but if there are enough nurses , then the care agencies would pay them less would n't they ? 
  paying a high salary to nurses means there is a shortage on the market , which is partially filled by immigrants now . 
  have there been zero immigrants , nurses would have been probably 2000 $ . 
  would you have felt better if a local nurse had 2000 rather than an immigrant 1200 now ? 
  edit : you would still not be a nurse , still had to move cities , and your grandmother would have been cared the same , just for a higher price . 
  but maybe now the state does n't have enough money to pay 2000e to so many nurses and reduce the eligibility by 20 % . 
  who knows , maybe your grandmother would n't qualify in this scenario anymore . 
  have you considered carers have a ( much ) harder job - instead of lifting 1kg pizza 's you would be lifting 60kg persons ? 
  why do n't you apply to be a carer if you think it 's so well paid ? 
   dehumanizing call center jobs why do n't they quit then and go care for elders , it 's much more respectable to wipe shit from old people who often have dementia . 
  btw , they have negoita on tape trafficking sex with minor members of his party . 
  he offered the girls to other party members , the girls accepted in exchange for getting the `` miss '' title , pageant winner . 
  i have no idea why he 's not in jail for that . 
  this time it 's for real . 
  they got a former prime minister in jail , he was once the leader of the biggest and most corrupt party ( socialists ) . 
  they also indicted the most recent former prime minister . 
  former president 's brother is in jail , his close associate is in jail . 
  top 3-4 oligarchs are serving or served in jail , regardless of their political color . 
  not all terrorists are alike . 
  in today 's laws even false bomb alarms go as terrorism , because sometimes they achieve the purpose of scaring or terrorising . 
  i do n't think we should jail for life students that make a false bomb call or people who send letters saying `` this letter has antrax '' with an innofensive white flour ( wheat ) .
