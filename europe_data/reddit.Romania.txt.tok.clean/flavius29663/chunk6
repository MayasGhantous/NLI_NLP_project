  the west bought the factories and land for peanuts . 
  it finally pays to have junker there , a guy that knows tax evasion , he is from luxembourg afterall . 
  hmm , you 're into something here ... 
  around the world , most hydro are producing under 100 % installed capacity , because they are not base load suppliers . 
  what are you suggesting , that they let water escape the pipes without going through the turbines ? 
  no way, 
   yep . 
  if kosovo did n't declare indepndance or if serbia recognized it , serbia ( along with kosovo or without it in case of serbia rocgnition ) would be in eu , like , yesterday . 
  no matter the rule of law , democracy standards , whatever . 
  it 's not that easy ...  de facto it already happened . 
  what ? 
  i am not aware , which copenhagen criteria was not met by romania in 2007 ? 
  fat fish chasing an amoeba muhaha, 
  we have one about a smaller city , i guess it fits : if you do n't brake from due time , you 'll drive past it . 
  funny thing is , the kind of gypsies that roam the streets are all but extinct from romania , they all went west . 
  you 'll see more gypsies ( romanian or not ) in london than in cluj-napoca . 
  albanians are not slavs iirc , they are indoeuropean and coverted to islam, 
  what an abomination that map is , it looks like romania spilled it 's ~ ~ blood ~ ~ contents over the southern border, 
   i do n't think europe in its entirety has ever been so volatile worse than ruso turko wars , than napoleonic wars , than wwi wwii , worse than imminent total annihilation in germany during cold war ? 
  i wanted to say the same thing ( as dngrs ) , how can it be more neutral than `` i really do n't care , build a damn wall if you want '', 
  there are 3 levels : 1 . 
  ** soviet union ** was an organizational model made by the bolsheviks after the 1917 revolution to organize the russian empire . 
  it included russia and occupied countries like estonia , latvia , lithuania , ukraine , belarus , kazakhstan , after wwii part of romania ( now republic of moldova ) . 
  this of it like the equivalent of united states while occupying mexico and all of central america all organized in a federal state ( not canada , that is usa 's china in this example ) . 
  ** warsaw pact ** a union with the purpose of defending the democracy against fascist burgeois pigs . 
  this included romania , poland , east germany , cehoslovacia , hungary , albania and bulgaria . 
  this all had communists governments imposed and maintaned when needed by russian tanks . 
  think of this like nato , a nato that parachutes tanks in paris if france elects a backward ( leftist ) government ( prague 1968 ) - btw ceaseusescu publicly denounced the prague invasion and romania got hell for that in the years to come . 
  ** other communist countries ** like china , vietnam , north korea , yugoslavia , cuba . 
  russia influence in there was in the sense of `` brotherhood cooperation to protect against imperialists '' . 
  the equivalent of these are capitalists countries not in nato , similar to switzerland , finland , sweden etc. 
  typical brainwashed antena3 person ( our fox news ) . 
  the prosecutors got former president 's brother and a lot of it 's close circle , but they keep saying it 's just for show , to hide the former president 's mischiefs ( how this helps in hiding i do n't know ) . 
  hating the former president is a religion among these people . 
  i guess even if he will be arrested at some point it will still be * just for show , to cover up bigger crimes *, 
  btw , romania was never into soviet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union#administrative_divisions, 
  you ca n't make this up, 
  i think roaming will have a `` fair use '' clause , after which it 's not free anymore , around 2-3 gb iirc, 
  the local operations must obey romanian laws , but not the hqs , board , finances and so on . 
  i was referring to frank timis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_timi%c8%99#gabriel_resources, 
  they were actually dubious investors initally led by a romanian , they only registered in canada for it 's lax mining laws . 
  they do n't look like gypsies to me, 
  but you actually did block our admission , even after the borders were secured ( it happened to be a german company ), 
  you can spell it * q * it 's pronounced the same, 
  i get there are objective reasons for which the greeks are having a hard time securing their border . 
  but this does n't make it less their responsibility . 
  and if greece can not do this on it 's own , eu should help them do this , rather than just inviting more refugees into the heart of europe . 
  greece did this to themselves , not managing properly the borders . 
  span and italy did it better . 
  i do n't agree with orban , it 's just that greece is at fault here , like it or not, 
   north stream itself is n't that controversial i think oh yes it was from the beginning . 
  that is why it was approved days before chancellor was getting out of office , think about it . 
  just look at the controversy section : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream#political_aspects i also remember the news from that era , and nord stream was not viewed as `` just a pipe '' even then . 
  maybe as a german you did n't care so much about the controversy before the schrodder going to gazprom , but it 's just as now : germany only cares about cheap gas , east europe and nordic states wants to protect from russian pressure . 
   many people do n't take interest in it . 
  germans have this luxury , but everyone east of germany does n't . 
  each concession to russian politics is a stab in our backs . 
  see my extensive comment here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3z6zjf/the_unseemly_energy_deal_between_germany_and/cylv0wf, 
   it is benefitial to us on the short term only , because fucking up the east eu is not in your interest . 
   these are the countermeasures for our sanctions you do n't seem to be familiar with russian external politics , they were banning random produce from a country they did not like . 
  whenever something happened not on their liking ( internal policy ) they banned something from that country . 
  look at the dates for the examples below : * russia bans estonia foods in jan 2014 ( before crimea ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvcaex-trrk * 2013 russia bans 11 estonian dairy and fish exporters http://news.err.ee/v/economy/5ba9c66d-3a69-4b8d-a888-2e84dafe8d05 * 2006 latvia canned fish is banned http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/16776/ * 2013 russia ban moldovan wine because of quality ( moldovan wine is one of he best and most recognizedin the region ) this is because moldova had a pro-eu government . 
  http://www.mediafax.ro/economic/rusia-interzice-importurile-de-vin-din-republica-moldova-11311025 * 2010 russia bans moldovan wines after the president declared that soviet troops were ocupation forces , not liberators http://agroromania.manager.ro/articole/stiri/rusia-interzice-importurile-de-vinuri-din-republica-moldova-8163.html the list goes on and on and on . 
  they are not concerned by quality ( these products have no issue in eu ) or economic mutual prosperity . 
  they just use the banning tool to fuck up the little ones . 
  whenever a moldovan leader did something pro-west they banned their wines , whenever they turned east , the ban was lifted . 
  i get that germany lost 20 billions in export to russia , but for moldova food exports are making up the bulk of their economy and these random hammers are destroying their brittle economy . 
  because romania and poland always stood up to russia and confronted them , we have the worst gas prices in all of europe . 
  http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html in the recent years romania has achieved 100 % internal gas production after we closed old chemical factories , i guess that is why the price got lower now . 
   and that 's why there are sanctions in place there were no sanctions when russia did all those bans i listed above , there were no sanctions after georgia . 
  this gave putler the feeling he can do anything and the west wo n't anything about it . 
  that is why he had the courage to fuck up ukraine so badly . 
   gas is n't sanctioned , and for good reason . 
  the problem is not the gas , of course everybody needs the russian gas , or else they would freeze . 
  the point is that the gas can already be carried over existing pipes . 
  ns1 and ns2 gives more power to the germany-russia relationship undermining eu and ee ( and indirectly usa ) . 
   you 're good at painting things black and white here . 
  it 's hard not to do that when you were neighbors with russia for 200 years and saw the `` benefits '' of it 's external politics . 
  tell me one country that increased prosperity because of bordering russia , and that is happy to have russia at their doorsteps !, 
  germany is the only one ( i do n't know about asia ) that russia treats with decency . 
  everyone else is just getting fuked by the big bear with every occasion . 
  hungary , serbia and the balkans are closer to russia because they were not neighbors , russians are playing nice to them until they are . 
  that is why a big deal with russia is at the moment good for germany on the short term , but really bad on the long term ( first for ee , then for eu as a whole ) . 
  edit : it was russia 's involvement in ukraine 's internal politics that lead to ukraine gas crisis since 2005 . 
  after the orange revolution in late 2004 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_revolution , russia breached their gas contracts in 2005 and raised prices https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%e2%80%9306_russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_dispute#historical_background . 
  how are they * extremely pissed * if now germany just goes further with his plans ? 
  nothing is free , reducing transit fees for germany while existing pipes can take the load mean that russia will deal directly with germany and can piss on everyone else in ee , which they do already even without this . 
  this pipe is a further leverage russia has in ee and it will use it to destabilize the region and eu as a hole . 
  as proven time and again , gazprom is not just a corporation going for profit , it 's used extensively by russia to impose external politics . 
  and by external politics , russia understands to bully smaller neighbors into submission ( ofc all neighbors are smaller so ... bad luck ) . 
  edit : to clarify , i am not saying that his pipe alone will destabilize eu , but it 's another tool in the kremlin 's politics bag . 
  not against russian gas itself , but against russian companies including gazprom and gazprombank and other energy firms . 
  just search for gazprom in the link below . 
  it may not specifically state banning of gazprom new underwater pipes , but north stream 2 for sure violates the sanctions at least in their spirit , if not technically https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis#third_round_of_sanctions:_2014.e2.80.93present, 
  you are dealing with a russia which is literally behaving like stalin in external policies , but it 's ok because it 's beneficial for you . 
  russia shitted all over finland , baltic states , poland , ukraine , moldova , romania etc. 
  with all sort of political backed economic sanctions for years on end ( even before our sanctions ) : unreasonably higher gas prices for some , random banning of certain fruits , wines , fish ( for estonia ) , wood ( for finland ) just to screw up with their economies . 
  they kept messing with everyone just because they can , and now they invaded georgia and ukraine . 
  but it 's beneficial for you to make a billion dollar deal with them so it 's all fine . 
  it was controversial even back then , that is why the chancellor did n't went through with it until the very last weeks in power .
