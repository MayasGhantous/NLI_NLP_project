  now for sure it does n't comply with the sanctions against russia and the efforts for a common energy market . 
  yeah man , i do n't get why germans on this sub are so defensive of this policy and gerhart schrodder . 
  just because he and his policy is german they immeditelly stand behind it . 
  you are the first german ( are you one ? ), 
  that criticizes this situation . 
  there are sanctions against russian companies.that is why russians stopped projects where western assistance was required . 
  the fact is that your chancellor approved north stream just before ending his mandate , then immediatelly went to work for gazprom to lead north stream . 
  do n't tell me german political power was not used in both ns1 and ns2 . 
  you do n't have to know what was discussed behind closed doors , the facts speak for themselves . 
  you are right , this article does indeed look like it was written by an average person . 
  how can i trust an article that says `` austria never had colonies '' when the habsburg empire was one of the biggest and long lived in europe ? 
  it drained lots of resources from periphery to vienna , making it a form of colonialism . 
  remove postcummunists , replace with communists, 
  us debt is mostly internal http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2013/10/pm-gov_debt_v-624.gif, 
  what i wanted to say ( and i failed to transmit this message ) is that from a pure economic point of view transnistria is not dependent on russia , i expressed that comment in the view of `` what if transnistria goes 100 % in eu '' . 
  '' * given a spherical cow * where russian politics do n't fuck up economies '' situation . 
  i have trouble finding good sources on transnistria , so i thought their exports are just 5 % . 
  this here states it 's 19 % http://www.timpul.md/articol/transnistria-i-dependena-de-exporturile-in-ue-47968.html russia does indeed prop them , cheaper gas and even by sending them free money each year to cover the deficit . 
  http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2013-05-16/aided-economy-characteristics-transnistrian-economic-model and of course they have ties to russia , just if you think that 30 % of population is russian . 
   it 's their only supplier of gas gas imports can come from anywhere , and exports of 19 % are not earth shattering if you lose them , this is similar with lithuania for example . 
   russian businessmen own a lot of the economy there sure , but they ca n't take everything in trucks and move to russia . 
  i have n't been there , but from what i can find on the internet ( as an armchair economist ) i have the feeling transnistria does not depend economically on russia . 
  of course at the moment it does n't develop properly because of the political clusterfuck created and maintained by fsb . 
  i mean they mostly sell iron and steel , you can easily sell that in eu , it 's not hard to make it up to standards . 
  at the moment transnistria already has some trade agreement with eu , and russian exports are around ~ ~ 5 % ~ ~ 19 % , so rf ~ ~ does n't really matter economically ~ ~ kinda matters . 
  is n't it funny , after 25 years of russian occupation , transnistria ~ ~ has almost no economic connection ~ ~ has no proper economic development with russia ~ ~ ( except the permanent russian tourists there ) ~ ~ . 
  it says in the article that the agreement applies to the entire republic of moldova , including transnistria . 
  the separatist region is de jure under moldavian rule , not even russia recognizes the separatists officially . 
  this creates an * interesting * situation , where transnistria gets gas from russia , never pays for it , though the debt is accumulating for moldova . 
  well , we got gypsies out of romania and into west europe , so you are also right !, 
  ps : thanks for getting them all , we hardly see any on the streets of romania now . 
  can you please send some fiscal inspectors in romania , thanks !, 
  you created this account just to answer me , wow . 
  i appreciate you took the time to answer me , i had just a vague idea how this nl tax transferring works but you clearly know more . 
  your post confirms what i knew , nl has this legal niche facilitating transfer of money from eu to tax havens . 
  i never said it 's not legal or in breach of eu treaties . 
  it is legal , just as any other * tax optimization * techniques . 
   we have a tax treaty with almost any country so big companies know beforehand what to expect when they trade with smaller nations . 
  that is why it 's easy to get money out of eu legally to tax havens , got it . 
   netherlands does n't fine companies or people ridiculous amounts if a dispute arises in court and the person or company happens to lose that procedure so even if a * tax optimizer * is discovered to have been shady , nothing earth-shattering happens to the company , it just continues to optimize taxes less aggressively . 
   gdp in vat taxes , and what a country actually collects . 
  it shows that the dutch tax authority does a remarkably fine job collecting taxes its owed , vat is collected in romania or elsewhere in eu where the service is being sold , not in nl . 
  where the headquarter is , so i am not sure how efficiency of vat collection matters here . 
  vat evasion is a crime at small scale , it can add up to a lot for a country , but * tax optimization * happens after the sell and does n't affect this tax haven discussion so much , is n't it ? 
   and its legislation is all within eu guidelines and there is the problem , the guidelines allow this lax tax legislation in one country to facilitate subtraction of taxes worth hundreds of billions from other eu countries . 
  you confirmed entirely my point , what am i missing here ? 
  netherlands is a gateway inside eu , so every eu company has the right to reside there , and in the same time nl has laws to facilitate easy overseas money operations through company-friendly laws . 
  they did n't coin the term * dutch sandwich * for nothing http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/no-more-dutch-sandwich-the-netherlands-reviews-its-role-in-tax-evasion/, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_countries https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benelux https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/the-worlds-15-biggest-tax-havens/ netherlands is not technically a tax haven , but its legislation is built in such a way that it 's easy for big companies to register there and get their profits out of eu into a proper tax haven . 
  http://www.iamexpat.nl/read-and-discuss/expat-page/news/netherlands-tax-haven-fortune-500-companies  of the fortune 500 , 48 per cent have one or more limited companies ( b.v. ) in the netherlands . 
  we get so much complaints for a few thousands beggars ( highly annoying i agree ) , but nobody bats an eye for hundreds of billions lost yearly in taxes because of tax haven intermediaries . 
  eu must step up the game and do n't allow the low countries and others to facilitate tax fraud . 
  i do n't think so , it 's not correct , but we always refer to the united kindgom as `` marea britanie '' , or even england . 
  so in this study `` marea britanie '' includes northern ireland , but not ireland itself . 
  yeah , exactly , we disliked russia so much we `` enhanced '' our vocabulary to oust slavic synonyms and gave up on their alphabet . 
  when the german monarch came in romania this process was started for 100 years already . 
  keep in mind though that most original day-to-day words were always latin , and the grammar was always `` the most latin '' of all , being closest to the classical latin , unlike italian , french etc. 
  which are close to the vulgar latin . 
  and the black sea , our only true friend !, 
  ottoman empire , with the period of 1711-1820 being the darkest in our history , it set us back 100 years https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanariotes#phanariotes_in_the_danubian_principalities . 
  we struggled for 2000 years with foreign occupation , but it was never as bad as with the fanariotes . 
  more recently the feeling is not that bad anymore , but having an islamic fundamentalist as ruler is seen really bad here , especially since he is becoming a dictator ( we do n't like dictators ) . 
  ps : we are quite tolerant to other races/religions as long as they are peaceful and willing to integrate . 
  romanian turks in southern part have no issue whatsoever . 
  because they were absorbed in another , bigger country , which was not . 
  if east germany remained independent they would have been called that, 
  east germany was for sure east europe until 1990 , even now you have east-west differences . 
  that 's a good point , i never thought of the importance of air tubes length . 
  in other tunnel projects they have the luxury of intermediate stations ( drilled vertically ) , but not here . 
  why did the brits dig faster ? 
  better digging or more stable soil ? 
  most relevant being that their chancellor schroder ( the guy before merkel ) pleaded for north stream all his mandate ( it was controversial even back then ) and then signed north stream in the last day in office . 
  then he proceeded to be the president of north stream . 
  tell me again how germany is not the most relevant in this affair ? 
  i was n't implying that , just that for me it 's weird to call reclaim land `` natural sightlines '' while highways are `` man made '' and destroy the natural landscape . 
  for me it 's the same thing , they are both unnatural , but indeed highways are uglier than just plain reclaimed land . 
  plus , the dikes can be masked by vegetation and other nice things , while the road can not . 
  so i see your point entirely . 
  i saw some wiki articles in the meantime , you basically irrigate with fresh water and pump out everything . 
  this reduces the concentration of salt water to acceptable levels . 
  i thought it 's more complicated , but if 10th centuries peasants could do it ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soil_salinity_control#principles_of_salinity_control, 
   afsluitdijk yes , i wanted to see that !, 
  are there plans to dry those big lakes to the east of the dam ? 
  what are you doing with all the salt ? 
  how do you make the land fertile after draining all the water ? 
  only 3 hours drive from the polar circle yay ? 
  and that is just 10 % of sweden 's length , you need to drive 1900 km from south to north ? 
  i never imagined sweden is so huge . 
  edit : it 's the same distance if you drive from romania to uk , 
  ok , so this is what i asked initially , and it 's obvious from the map link i posted somewhere above, 
  hmm , i was under the impression you have the low lands checkered with dykes , just so that even if the sea-facing ones fail , you do n't have a catastrophic flood . 
  also , these inland dikes are used for controlled flooding , when the river levels get too high , you intentionally flood some agricultural lands is n't it ? 
  so i think you must have plenty of inland dikes . 
  like so : http://dutchdikes.net/map/ i guess a normal dike can not support a highway , but i was thinking at least 50 % of a highway foundation is already made by the dike , so increasing that to 100 % not only creates a better dike but also a highway . 
  this was you do n't have 2 eyesores : dike + highway , only one . 
  just saying edit : i found some examples , they are not highways , but smaller roads , so i was not so completely off , it 's possible : https://www.google.com/maps/place/3247+dirksland,+netherlands/@51.761342,4.0650379,3a,90y,210.52h,52.3t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1snjgocthx3hd96-iqu5_ujg!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dnjgocthx3hd96-iqu5_ujg%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d309.52826%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c45a5932f2d009:0x8716990379fcf20d!6m1!1e1 https://www.google.com/maps/place/aalsmeer,+netherlands/@52.2695373,4.8038701,3a,75y,218.71h,88.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srpm-i1ory9hqvuohrtiqfa!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3drpm-i1ory9hqvuohrtiqfa%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d216.679%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c5de00d69f34af:0x400de5a8d1e7450!6m1!1e1 one of the streets is actually called `` north dike '' , take that / u/gilbereth :p, 
  exactly , and with the actions they take eu is proving each time they are the junior ones , with no long term vision . 
  a * special * country building a new gas pipe with sanctioned russia , because it has more rights than smaller countries . 
  and it 's not just about germany , i am sure france or uk will turn from eu common policy just as easily if they had the choice . 
  that is why eu is second-hand compared to us .
