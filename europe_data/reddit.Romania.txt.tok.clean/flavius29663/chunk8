  yeah , but you do n't build new gas pipelines in the middle of russia sanctions, 
  because germany undermines a common energy policy that would stop russia from using gas as a political tool . 
  if russia would just sell the gas to the highest bidder as in a normal economy nobody would say anything , but russia bullies the ee using economic tools . 
  a common energy policy would stop russia from doing that , since it can not take on all of eu at once . 
  but reclaimed land means building a dike right ? 
  why not build the highway on top of the dike ? 
  you save money from building the highway foundation . 
  and the highway is by definition protected by floods and also no more water pumping especially for it . 
  and less space is used , which makes the reclaim land even more valuable . 
  but you still have n't fulfilled my curiosity , if you have so many dikes , why not built highways on top of them ? 
   that would interfer with the natural sightlines but reclaiming thousands km ^ 2 of sea land is not interfering with the * natural sightlines * ? 
  would n't it be smarter to just build a big dike underneath the motorway . 
  this way you hit 2 birds with a stone : dike + motorway at the same cost . 
  and for the environment , just make some under-road passages for wildlife . 
  ( or would the dike collapse under the weight of the highway ? ), 
  - i am genuinely asking this , i am sure there is a good reason why it 's not like that . 
  i take more care of electronics when i change the ram in the pc . 
  * germany opposes nato bases in poland to not upset russia http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-nato-east-iduskbn0f00s120140625 * a german lead commission forbids bulgaria to build south stream ( there are no russian sanctions at this time ) http://www.euractiv.com/energy/commission-south-stream-agreemen-news-532120 * germany expands ( signs ) nord stream to nord stream 2 with russia , despite all the russia sanctions , in june 2015 all of the above happened ** before ** merkel invited all refugees to europe and muscled in the refugee quota . 
  i know technically merkel did n't technically * invite * anyone , but her actions and speeches were seen in middle east and africa as an invite , open doors to everyone . 
  i personally do n't take any position regarding refugees , but i just wanted to point out the timeline of events . 
  explain to me again , how are slovakian actions a cause for the german undermining of eu common foreign policy ? 
  but i do n't get it , all of ee profited from eu massively . 
  how can you be against it now ? 
  i mean the other states are belarus , ukraine , moldova , albania , serbia . 
  is n't it obvious that it 's better in the eu and the west ? 
  so it was more like : `` the body gives too much money to ngos ( ** non governmental ** organizations ) that the ** government ** does not like . 
  confiscate the money and allow the ** government ** to distribute the funds to ngos they do like ! '', 
  - i mean the government is supposed to properly fund the organizations it `` likes '' anyway , but then they are not ngos , these are public services . 
  are the voters happy with this kind of brain-melting logic ? 
  it 's good at least it was n't about the * big * norwegian fund , even though i suspect this behavior raised some eyebrows in oslo . 
   norwegian civil fund what ? 
  is n't that fund supposed to invest in countries ? 
  they are against foreign investors now ? 
  there is a typo : all 5 are from europe . 
  europe/eurovision what 's the difference ? 
  you missed the past tense : they ** did ** deported 2 million people during and after wwii http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/ussr.tab8a.gif and also the induced famine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1946%e2%80%9347#in_moldova, 
  they gave us a 4 day ultimatum in 1940 , so yeah , it can be worse https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina#soviet_ultimatum, 
  anything to annoy the big bear !, 
  i wonder how viable this union is economically , they are both big countries with big potential , but turkey exported 2 bln to ukraine and imported 4 bln , totaling less than < 2 % of all trade . 
  would be hard to include with a romanian majority, 
  this , after the ottoman empire fell apart , british and french divided the territories into `` suitable '' countries so they can split and colonize them , instead of letting them free to choose their own destiny . 
  my frustrated friend , first look at your idols : 80 % of hungarian parliament is jobbik and fidesz . 
  those shepherds in the pictures are smarter than that , they would n't elect such specimens in parliament . 
  and they fight for their rights , unlike hungarian ethnics who always elect a nationalistic party just because ; and then they let the same politicians cut their forests to pieces . 
  you are laughing at the shepherds instead of looking at the sheeple , but yeah it 's hard to see that if you are one yourself . 
   it 's been a long standing tradition for decades ( probably since the 60 's ) that the truly talented and competent people get the job http://memecrunch.com/meme/15mxy/anchorman/image.png this never happened anywhere , anytime , if you believe this you are just fooling yourself . 
  you are better in hdi and slightly better in salaries and economy in general . 
  but what trolls_brigade is saying is that it 's no longer such a big difference anymore , we are comparable . 
  in some areas we are even better , country credit ratings are better for us , lower national debt , democracy seems healthier in romania . 
  i admit i am not a close follower of hungarian politics , but at least we have n't had extremists in parliament in a long time and they wo n't be back soon ; and hey , our president is from a minority !, 
  compare this to 1999 , when romania was almost bankrupt and we had violent revolts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad#january.e2.80.93february_1999_mineriad while hungary was cruising full speed towards the west and you were at least 2 times more advanced than we were . 
  in other words , it used to feel like you were 15 years ahead of us , now you are only 5 . 
  we were in the exact same situation until 2004 , but then eu happened and the politicians in power ( all of them ) wanted in , they had no choice , so eu forced us to do something . 
  we had to implement the dna ( called pna back in 2004 ) and do some new laws . 
  eu also created the cvm mechanism , which still stands http://ec.europa.eu/cvm/progress_reports_en.htm this mechanism is meant to guard the justice in romania and economically sanction us if we fail . 
  in one sense , being forced to join eu later actually helped us clean a little bit more our own courtyard . 
  anyway , it was n't easy , as each 2 steps forward meant another step backward . 
  the minister of justice passes a law that prosecutors no longer respond to their bosses , she is immediately sacked with a large majority from all parties ( including her own ! ), 
  for `` being incompetent '' . 
  we have constant attempts to declaw the agency , it used to be that every week there was a new law proposal to limit it 's powers . 
  eu and the us ambassadors always took a stance to help the agency and prosecutors so i guess we lost a bit of sovereignty there , but i am soo happy when i see a fat pig getting arrested for corruption . 
  us and eu look only after their interests , but it 's in their interest to have a strong , corruption-less ally rather than a weak one . 
  before this argument , my point was that we should all hate politicians equally regardless of party or ethnicity . 
  and if we see them squeal and saying a wealth commission is bad cause it makes you `` romania/hitler '' then exactly that commission should be made . 
  if they are saying a eu backed anti-corruption agency is violating your rights , you must make that agency . 
  there is n't much difference in how corrupt they are . 
  even in romania , there is a slight tendency to steal more in the socialist party , but they are all in on it . 
  even the ethnic hungarians have really bad records at corruption in our parliament . 
  ours ( bucharest ) and yours ( budapest ) , they are all in on it . 
  the nationalistic bullshit we hear from them is just to make us vote and forget about the real issues . 
  hungarian mps were in romanian parliament ( 5-7 % ) since 1990 , been present in many governments , the result is that the hungarian majority counties are among the poorest , while hungarian mps are quite rich . 
  now we have one of these pigs is hiding from romanian prosecutors in hungary , where i think he asked asylum http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/mandat-european-de-arestare-emis-pe-numele-lui-marko-attila-14218930, 
  i am sorry but i really do n't get your point and how is that positive as long as you say `` we have nothing to discuss until romania is a rich as us '' , i really do n't . 
   maybe after you guys caught up or even beat us we could have a serious discussion about it , but currently - its pointless to even talk about it . 
  ~ ~ you are not even speaking with the peasantry , because you have 30 % more gdp per capita , oh my . 
  well , keep voting jobbik and orban , we will soon be equally poor . 
  meanwhile , you are left behind by all other v4 countries ( you had same admission dates to nato , eu , schenghen - unlike us ) , i do n't know why you try to boast with your economy . ~ ~ edit : i get it , i misread the comment, 
  it was started by the socialists pressured by the eu , but got real powers from the liberals . 
  now they are biting into everyone with equal justice . 
   maybe after you guys caught up or even beat us we could have a serious discussion about it , but currently - its pointless to even talk about it . 
  ~ ~ you mean caught up as in having mostly extremists and nationalists in parliament ? ~ ~ edit : i get it , i misread the comment, 
  our politicians also squeal in all forms when their affairs are put under the magnifying glass . 
  if we learned anything , it 's that the more they bark against these measures , the guiltier they are . 
  they will invoke anything from national interest , privacy , state secrets , foreign forces , nationalists , media campaigns ... everybody is guilty of some sort of subversion , defamation campaign , destabilization and so on , while they are only honest leaders trying their best for poor hungary/romania/etc . 
  we did it romania , hungary should take a lesson from us and create their own dna ( anti-corruption directorate ), 
  really ? 
  to me it looks like half their actions is how to stop prosecutors investigating their own and how to declaw the anticorruption agency . 
  the other half is spent on tv shows trying to convince the public that they are honest and deserve immunity . 
  in what is left of their time they try to catch up with the rest of the world laws ( badly ) . 
  we only got some half ass modern laws because we were forced to do so when integrating in eu in 2007 . 
  when was that projection on the parliament ? 
  last entry : tunisia . 
  this must be the worst list on wiki . 
  i was just saying that being the leader of the state is not a sufficient condition to be labeled as an example of feminism success . 
  i do n't know thatcher enough to plead one way or the other . 
  first romanian communists years were under a jewish woman , but i would n't call that a success story for women or jews . 
  why do n't you have more business with them right now ? 
  how is eu stopping that ? 
  what are you planning to export to china and commonwealth that you already do n't ? 
   we would n't abandon it they wo n't allow uk to have all the benefits without being in the union , that is for sure .
