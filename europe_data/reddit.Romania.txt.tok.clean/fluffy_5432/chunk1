very few countries recognize crimeea as part of russia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation#recognition even belarus is somewhat ambiguous . 
  clicking on poland takes me to the page for ukraine . 
  hidden message from putin ? 
  there is absolutely no way this could turn ugly . 
  i did not know it was intentional . 
  citation ? 
  i just figured there were bigger things to worry about in an economic crisis than the maastricht criteria . 
  no , deficit is higher that 3 % : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_convergence_criteria#fulfillment_of_criteria but the same is true of several countries currently inside the eurozone , notably france . 
  last election ( 2014 ) they won [ 66.83 % of seats with 44.54 % of the popular vote ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/legal-but-not-fair-hungary/ ) . 
  i was shocked to read this . 
  in 2010 they won 52 % in a landslide which also translated to more than 66 % of seats . 
  i guess it 's a combination of a voting system which rewards winners disproportionally , a collapse of the opposing parties and later efforts to concentrate power . 
  i find this very difficult to believe . 
  does it really apply to all internet traffic ? 
  maybe it 's just for mobile or personal connections ? 
  the rate is extremely high . 
  for example [ amazon ec2 ] ( https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ ) charges a few cents/gb . 
  if this tax is enforced on commercial companies it would likely kill most of hungary 's it industry . 
  the view from that picture is looking directly towards the city center . 
  this is not a `` hole in bucharest '' as much as a large undeveloped area on the margins of the city . 
  here 's a map link : https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.4003275,26.1339325,15z?hl=en, 
  this was part of the plot of an [ episode of 30 rock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somebody_to_love_ ( 30_rock \\ ) ) . 
  spain and italy will soon be part of the romanian empire . 
   romania ranks behind only greece and bulgaria in terms of corruption in the 28-nation eu , according to transparency international , and the european commission has put its justice system under special monitoring . 
  wait , we beat greece ? 
  the part about sending security services to the the press would not happen in romania . 
  they went after the president 's brother instead . 
  but then they could n't brag about all those meticulously calculated digits . 
  this is brilliant . 
  romanian top words : hungary bad !, 
  reason ? 
  shit guy talk . 
  fact !, 
  the habsburgs are against nationalism ? 
  is this 1915 or 2015 ? 
  it 's nice to see that they did n't all die out due to inbreeding . 
   if the only other option is that we have solidarity when it suits the eastern eu nations and no solidarity when it does n't , then the eu is dead already i 'm curious , what is your opinion on greece ? 
  why should the poor countries of the eastern eu show more ` solidarity ' to the west than you did to greece ? 
  it 's worth mentioning that greece 's primary problem is debt owed to the taxpayers of much wealthier western countries ( especially germany ) . 
  it is fully in your power to forgive those debts . 
  do we actually know if he said `` forced '' ? 
  can some swedish person confirm ? 
  i hope something was lost in translation here . 
  because using eu rules to `` force '' countries to take immigrants against their will is an excellent argument for exiting the union . 
  living in germany is not a human right . 
  because syrians are not german ? 
   a german had every right to live in germany , being it west or east . 
  there 's a reason its called germany . 
  this does not apply to syrians . 
   they are the most un-german people i can think of, 
   `` if the danes vote yes to an opt-in agreement , should denmark then participate in the eu 's cooperation on common rules for immigration , asylum , and border controls ? '', 
  this is a very strangely worded question , maybe it 's not translated properly . 
  `` if the majority decides to cooperate , should we cooperate ? '', 
   `` how much do you agree/disagree that refugees seeking asylum in an eu country should be distributed more evenly between the countries , as the eu commission has suggested ? '', 
  would n't this actually result in fewer refugees in denmark ? 
  people who oppose immigration have no reason to disagree with this . 
  if the `` redistribution '' resulted in higher number of refugees in denmark then opinions would be very different . 
   `` should the effort to rescue shipwrecked asylum seekers in the mediterranean be completely abandoned ? '', 
  this is sort of like asking `` do you like drowning babies ? '', 
  vandals settled in spain . 
  so what is the conclusion of that article ? 
  but is n't french unemployment consistently above the european average , especially among young people with poor skills ? 
  i think it 's far to point out that a lot of the difficulty they have in finding proper jobs is shared with non-muslim youth . 
  i would argue that increasing overall employment would be the most effective way to deal with this . 
  even if you completely remove absolutely any trace of discrimination their situation is not going to improve all that much . 
  yeah , fuck the filthy plebs . 
   a beret made of mohair or its imitation , and often a handmade one , is commonly associated with its typical wearers , mostly poor elderly ladies . 
  wtf , making fun of poor elderly ladies ? 
  while many gypsies are poor there is a also a significant minority which has spectacular wealth and displays it ostentatiously . 
  i bet their houses are rented too : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghtbphqcxcy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xcjbu6fma, 
  i think this is just confirmation bias . 
  if you 're concerned about the far right you will see nazi boogie-men `` fucking everywhere '' . 
  if you 're concerned that the left is pushing migration and open borders against the wishes of native voters then you will find plenty proof to confirm your worries too . 
  it 's almost like this is the biggest concern in europe right now . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chi7qtfprxo ), 
  but this is an excellent quality post . 
  hooray , romania is more relevant than poland . 
  the territory of modern poland also had millions of germans . 
  the most important fact about the hungarian minority is that they are mongolian invaders . 
  it is known . 
  no , we shipped them all to england . 
  the romance languages seem to have just adopted the greek scientific name with minor modifications . 
  the local words for bird and snout are different . 
  there should be an automatic warning for all `` news '' posts that are more than a few weeks old . 
  at least this post should receive an `` old news '' flair . 
  am i the only one who is appalled that the government is debating the diet of children ? 
  this is absolutely ridiculous . 
  i say eliminate all school lunches and let parents pack food if they want . 
  they must have burned a lot of weed to come up with this . 
  none of this would have happened if ikea sold guns . 
   it 's huge in the media here but in reality it 's just some really shitty neighborhoods in malm\u00f6 , certainly nothing the majority of swedes worry about much in specific . 
  i think this is a really fucked up attitude : `` sure , some of our neighborhoods are really violent but it does n't really matter because that 's where the poor people live '' . 
  why place a fake bomb though ? 
  i heard there was a discount on grenades in ikea . 
  they should emigrate to romania . 
   a party who hates the european union so much that their leader takes hundreds of thousands of pounds to be a member of the european parliament . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being an mep who opposes the eu . 
  he was elected because people wanted him to be represent them . 
  according to that article he lives mostly off the generous salary of his elected position . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that either .
