`` familie '' - indefinite article `` familia '' - definite article, 
  this is more like something artificially created and fueled by some politicians over the years . 
  like 20 or more years ago there was n't this hate towards hungary like it is today but thanks to political propaganda and interests , now it 's a bit there , visible . 
  strange is , it 's mostly the south of romania that is more ignorant and prone to be like this , most people in transylvania do n't have any hate or conflicts with the magyars living here , or the ones over the border . 
  i know i had and have magyar friends and they are not different than the ones that only speak romanian . 
   people named after flowers and trees in my country trees too ? 
  here we have only the flower part , afaik . 
  my advice , use photos . 
  the website requires flash ( what year is this ? ), 
  so not many can access it , and besides that , it 's a bit unintuitive . 
  i guess then , we both understood it wrong the first time . 
  now , another problem , looking again at the oecd website , and i click the source database , there is no mention of romania anywhere , not even in the past years , and this is probably the reason for no data on map . 
  how did they get 1.627 on the first page , for 2015 , and nothing for 2016 , and nothing in the source document ? 
  if the value is real , i assume is around 1.64 for 2016 ( estimating ) , and more for 2017 , but the salary also increased in 2017 ( the one we used in the example ) so it 's compensating . 
  anyway , i see in bulgaria maximum is 1000bgn ( 0.677 ppp ) for a teacher , so it 's just slightly higher , basically making us the lowest in eu . 
  i 'm no expert here but from understanding , the ron needs to be converted to usd . 
  ppp shows the purchasing power , in usd . 
  at least wiki says it needs to be in usd . 
   purchasing power parity ( ppp ) is measured by finding the values ( in usd ) of a basket of consumer goods that are present in each country ( such as orange juice , pencils , etc. ) . 
  if that basket costs $ 100 in the us and $ 200 in england , then the purchasing power parity exchange rate is 1:2 . 
  from googling around , it seems like germany has from 46456 ( lowest ) to 61209 ( highest ) annual salary , converted in usd , per year . 
  the average would be 53833 usd . 
  now , their ppp is 0.774 , so ( 53833/0 .774 ) = 69551 = 69 ( 1000 usd/ppp ) , which seems pretty close with the map ( 66 ) . 
  the map says well payed not best payed so i guess it 's around there . 
  in france i see the average salary of a teacher is around 47257 usd/year . 
  now compare our 6k usd ( max . 
  for teacher ) with something like 61k usd in germany ( max . 
  for a teacher ) , or 47k ( average ) in france , and tell me we are overpaying ours , considering that lots of goods , like food or electronics , are about the same price , mainly services and rent is quite different . 
  well , the map is for teachers ( primary school ) not professors ( gymnasium , high school ) . 
  from the table above , you can see the monthly salary of a professor ( 2736ron , close to yours ) with full experience , and a teacher ( 2187ron ) . 
  you also forgot to convert it into usd , yours show it in ron not usd . 
  so , for a full experienced teacher : 2187 * 12 = 26244 ron = 6168 usd 6168/1 .627 = 3791 / 1000 = 3.79 ( 1000 usd/ppp ) for a full experienced professor : 2736 * 12 = 32832 ron = 7716 usd 7716/1 .627 = 4742 / 1000 = 4.74 ( 1000 usd/ppp ) btw , ppp is from 2015 i think , now it could be higher . 
  also , to calculate it for professors , teacher etc , use [ this ] ( http://salarii.bestbigdeal.com/index.php ) . 
  this is net but the thing is , that is 1000usd/ppp . 
  so , if i 'm not wrong , in france you would get around 40k usd/year , or in germany around 51k usd/year , using their respective ppp . 
  so to approximate for romania , for a year , for an experienced teacher ( 40 + years , 2187ron ) , you would get around 6164 usd/year . 
  that means our 1000usd/ppp is ** 3.79 ** . 
  i think that is way below any other country on the map , so we pay them worse and the others are paying them well . 
  yes there are some bonus but the majority nowadays do n't fall into that category . 
  for principal , it sounds about right . 
  you can calculate exactly [ here ] ( http://salarii.bestbigdeal.com/index.php ) ( for romanians only ) . 
  we are not even worth mentioning  . 
  now seriously , i made a list for whoever is interested . 
  data is the for 2017 . 
  monthly wages in the table are net not gross . 
  teacher is basically for primary school ( 1-4 ) , professor for gymnasium ( middle school , 5-8 ) and high school ( 9-12 ) . 
  these grades and experiences are overly simplified , but also to show some extremes . 
  experience/grade | beginner ( 0-1 years ) | grade ii ( 1-6 years ) | grade ii ( 40 + years ) | grade i ( 6-10 years ) | grade i ( 40 + years ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- teacher | 1271ron ( 280 $ ) | 1320ron ( 290 $ ) | 1931ron ( 425 $ ) | 1459ron ( 321 $ ) | 2187ron ( 481 $ ) professor | 1450ron ( 319 $ ) | 1518ron ( 334 $ ) | 2303ron ( 507 $ ) | 1580ron ( 348 $ ) | 2736ron ( 602 $ ) i guess you multiply that by 12 but i do n't know what other benefits they might get at the end of the year . 
  ppp around 1.6, 
  are you sure is not one of the poe ( or maybe d2 , forgot ) maps ? 
  / s looks very nice . 
  you forgot to mention a few things : a ) 3948ron is the gross salary for a grade i professor with at least 40 years experience in education , basically the highest for a high school professor . 
  net is 2736ron . 
  b ) that is not net , that is gross salary in the link . 
  ----- here are the monthly wages , net not gross . 
  teacher is basically for primary school ( 1-4 ) , professor for gymnasium ( middle school , 5-8 ) and high school ( 9-12 ) . 
  these grades and experiences are overly simplified , but also to show some extremes . 
  experience/grade | beginner ( 0-1 years ) | grade ii ( 1-6 years ) | grade ii ( 40 + years ) | grade i ( 6-10 years ) | grade i ( 40 + years ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- teacher | 1271ron ( 280 $ ) | 1320ron ( 290 $ ) | 1931ron ( 425 $ ) | 1459ron ( 321 $ ) | 2187ron ( 481 $ ) professor | 1450ron ( 319 $ ) | 1518ron ( 334 $ ) | 2303ron ( 507 $ ) | 1580ron ( 348 $ ) | 2736ron ( 602 $ ) edit : data is for 2017, 
  i think the only big difference might be the rent ? 
  it 's around 200 ~ 250 euros for some not so great apartment , around 350 ~ 450 euros for something modern or because of location , around 600 ~ 800 euros to have it all , modern and location . 
  there are also that cost thousands but not our interest here . 
  it might have been changed , those were estimates for the last time i 've been renting in bucharest . 
  note that a big part of the population can not afford to rent even at the lowest price , with our current wages . 
  thanks to other factors , mostly our socialist past , the home ownership rate is very high so plenty of people do n't have to rent . 
  thanks for the source !, 
   romania : formerly * nihil sine deo * ( latin : nothing without god ) and before that * to\u0163i \u00een unu * ( romanian : all in one ) . 
  * via\u021ba-n libertate ori moarte * ( romanian : life in freedom or death ! ) . 
  ** currently none ** . 
  well , is n't that fitting ... 
  well , then thanks for updates , it seems like this time i was the one uninformed . 
  do n't really know him much either . 
  that is good advice but i do n't know if we are the ones giving them one . 
  many in our own country feel hopeless today , there are even people over-reacting like here , that say romania is probably going to be kicked in the future from eu , because of the way things work and never change ( corruption etc ) , or because some politicians are against eu , and so on . 
  we can hardly convince our own people to vote against psd , and we know how hard it is with poor people , old people , or people living in the rural areas , being brainwashed by media and psd propaganda . 
  that 's true that we went our own way later on but for quite some time , especially in the early times ( gheorghe gheorghiu-dej ) , we were building many things after soviet standards/licences ( arms industry , trucks , tractors etc ) , until we made some of our own . 
  lets not forget , or rather dismiss , that russia was one of the leading countries in engineering and technology at some point in time . 
  we ca n't dismiss scientific progress that was made worldwide , benefiting everyone ( like inventions ) , just because the people who made it were living in soviet russia . 
  yes , the basement , which is like another level but smaller , is basically the foundation for these standard four levels blocks . 
  the soil in bucharest is sandy , bucharest has sedimentary soil , it 's also muddy ( big part of the city is only lakes , and a river ) , and it 's also the only city in the country having a metro system . 
   guys , please forgive him , he 's our resident communist . 
  we should really start a petition to keep him locked on r/romania . 
  please , on our subreddit people ( young one especially ) are easy on labeling someone as communist , when the reality contradicts their believe about the past . 
  i know he is wrong but he is just uninformed , rather than label him like that . 
  look at my country , romania . 
  such low unemployment rate , yet i doubt it since lots of people did n't register their unemployment , but that 's another story . 
  i think last time it was estimated at around 40 % who 's earning minimum wage ( ~ 235 euro net ) , and around 40 % who is earning less than average wage ( ~ 482 euro ) . 
  that sounds so familiar ... 
  `` live '', 
  [ salina turda ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=salina+turda&amp;tbm=isch ) is a salt mine . 
  a bit misrepresentative ( spell ? ), 
  i would say ? 
  you presented like 2 palaces , know at least [ another one ] ( http://imgur.com/a/sbj4r ) worth visiting . 
  missing lots of castle and fortresses . 
  there barely any photos with towns , maybe it 's time to promote [ my own town ] ( http://imgur.com/a/utjuc )  . 
  not necessarily towns in the mountains , [ remember this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/kc4ng ) ? 
  also , as i live in brasov , seen them many times going out of the woods at night , going straight for the garbage containers . 
  true but not everything is a product we can consume . 
  quite many years ago a couple of colleagues from university went to caltech , and never came back , and also found jobs there as researchers . 
  that does n't really benefit us directly since it 's u.s. intellectual property . 
  is this really an ee thing that i 've missed ?
