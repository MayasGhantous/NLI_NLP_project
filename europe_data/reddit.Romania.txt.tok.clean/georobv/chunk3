  if it was to happen , it would have been a union , if people there wanted , willingly . 
  it 's not my territory to begin with , i have no right on it , i do n't claim it . 
  anyway , this thing started from annex vs union , which there is nothing to debate here . 
  union vs reunion is hungarian vs romanian version of it . 
  well , it was a union then , if you do n't believe in the continuity of the romanian people along the history , before hungarian conquest . 
  was there a union earlier in history ? 
  same thing , read the second link in the above post , the history of transylvania ( wiki ) . 
  annexing on the other hand , it 's a different thing . 
  it was a union , or a reunion for the romanians living in those times . 
  it is [ union of transylvania with romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_transylvania_with_romania ) , not annexing . 
  you are the one coming with numbers first , how about do n't post any numbers then if you do n't give a shit ? 
  yes , it was a great tragedy but not the only tragedy in the history of europe , all countries have been through some bad history . 
  we celebrate great union day ( unification day ) not in spite of hungarians , it 's when same people are finally back together , as it was once before . 
  i 'm sorry if you believe we are celebrating their tragedy . 
  i 'm all for facts and numbers but just do n't mix them , coming with all different numbers . 
  it was a reunion , not a annexed . 
  anyway , from where 2 millions ? 
  year | 1880 | 1900 | 1910 -- | -- | -- | -- | romanians | 2.231.165 ( 54,9 % ) | 2.682.435 ( 55.0 % ) | 2.827.419 ( 53.7 % ) hungarians | 1.024.742 ( 25,2 % ) | 1.436.896 ( 29,5 % ) | 1.662.180 ( 31,6 % ) in 1910 they have been at their peak and started to go down after that , never 2 millions . 
  [ numbers here ] ( http://www.universulromanesc.com/ginta/threads/2335-structurile-demografice-din-transilvania-%c3%aen-timpul-dualismului-\\ ( 1867-1918 \\ ) ) in ro , or [ simplified wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_transylvania ) in en, 
   other interesting info :  at-risk-of-poverty rate and threshold . 
  `` in eight member states , namely romania ( 25.4 % ) true but lets not dismiss https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate ( mostly because our old socialist times ) . 
  those on the brink of poverty just do n't have or maybe have enough to buy minimum stuff but at least they still have their home , at least most of them . 
  from the working class , i think it was around 29 % who earned minimum wage ( 1450 lei , or 1065 lei net , or around 235 euro today ) . 
  nice , and interesting , i think we have [ two fortresses ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bfy8p ) that are build kinda similar . 
  here i 've read of people that fake the papers for kids , saying they got vaccinated , so they can be allowed in kindergarten . 
  i guess there is such a thing . 
   what i am disputing here is   most of the children are from the roma minority , who have have limited access to medicine it 's a bit stretched that only to them is happening but not really wrong tho . 
  it 's a combination of many things . 
  many of them still live in villages , most are not quite educated , they live isolated and do n't really want to interact ( because romanians ) , they live carelessly , nobody told them , they have their traditional methods to cure etc. 
  then you have the state that barely do anything or give anything to villages ( to some more or less ) because of corruption ( some stealing the money for medicine , some steal the medicine to sell it to other countries etc ) . 
  even in a city you have to insist for your own rights . 
  so , when he said limited , he did n't meant to say limited in rights but limited in supply . 
  not just a slav thing . 
  in romania we have a common unofficial word for germans ( besides calling them germans ) which is ` neam\u021b ' ( sg . ), 
  or ` nem\u021bi ' ( pl . ), 
  while ` sa\u0219i ' ( pl . ), 
  is only used for the saxons that established here long time ago . 
  a more common and unofficial word for germans that we have is ` neam\u021b / nem\u021bi ' , while ` sa\u0219i ' is used for the ones that established here long time ago . 
  it seems they also have the lowest [ home ownership rate ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/246355/home-ownership-rate-in-europe/ ) . 
  yea , probably this is not counted , [ home ownership rate ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/246355/home-ownership-rate-in-europe/ ) in east is a lot higher than in west . 
  i can only speak for romania ( which also seems to be the highest on that list ) but i guess it 's the same in most ex communist countries , where people kept their flat/apartments given for free to any working family during our socialist times . 
  you might be poor but at least you still have the apartment , which is nowhere near being cheap . 
  interesting . 
  plenty of romanian words are similar to english equivalent but i guess the way we say the words and tonality , changes the things quite a bit . 
  on the same note , it seems easier for a romanian to pick up words ( out of the box ) in the other two romance languages than the other way around . 
   i am sure romania , that is pro-european , will want to join the same speed of integration than us for example . 
  we have politicians who debate this against each other , there are arguments on both sides . 
  do n't know what their final decision will be . 
  if you think this is bad , the word adidas even made it into the romanian dictionary ( [ word ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/adida%c8%99i ) ) quite a while back , as in sport shoes . 
  people are too lazy to say sport shoes . 
  true that indeed but the jump seems massive , more than 20 % . 
  i guess the wind is quite unstable in this region ? 
   wind power is at 30 \u2105 of total currently . 
  30.30 % hidro 5.37 % eolian ( wind ) unless i 'm missing something, 
   i was talking in today 's money alright , but the prices where low , like i said , because the technology was already outdated and rapidly expanding , and the new technology was the one expensive . 
  by the time they released those z80 computers to everyone , those have been the times of first x86 pc 's released to everyone and their prices were at least five times of those with z80 processor , not to mention those ancient macintosh a few years later that had double the price of an imb . 
  with those ancient z80 you could write in basic ( the language back then ) or use some pascal interpreter written in basic . 
  a pc was something else . 
  imagine like today the difference between a smartphone and a basic cellphone with hard coded language ( like java ) . 
  prices of old tech was dropping fast , by the time i had money and bought my first 486 , a year later an outdated junk , much more capable than mine , was already cheaper than what i 've paid for , but the top of technology was always very expensive , and dropped the more we learned to how to build better electronics and when they moved manufacturing to asia . 
  i still remember those insane prices for memory sticks and hard drives , that with each year became cheaper and better . 
  anyway , today is not unusual to find a thousand dollars paying job in our country and afford one of those nice new smarthphones , not to mention that the price of a basic cellphone or an outdated smarthphone is a lot more affordable ( comparing with those z80 ) . 
   even today , the bulk of the sales still come from developed countries , like the us , uk or germany who were also rich back then as well . 
  well , the wages were also lower than what you see today . 
  i would n't say that germany was that rich back then , especially if you consider the east germany where min wage was around 200 marks ( divide that by almost 2 , to see in dollars ) by the time those z80 came out . 
  you have to understand that popularity only increased with time , and prices only decreased with time . 
  i also had one of those in '90 but by that time , it was already outdated and cheap ( in just a few years ) . 
  we already had intel 486 in the '90 ( upgrade of 386 , 286 ) , and the processor alone was like a thousand dollars . 
  the technology was rapidly evolving from year to year . 
  also , if you are referring to us dollars , the amount of dollars from back then is almost double in today 's money , but that 's not it , our average wage in our country was somewhere around ~ 150 dollars . 
  so imagine buying one of those things back then , it was extremely expensive . 
  a lot more countries had this problem with lower wages back then . 
  not to mention buying a macintosh ( mac ) , it was a lot more expensive . 
  also buying an operating system . 
  today we are almost double the population of the planet , we are also more than can afford a thousand dollars phone , our wages are not like back then , and other more factors . 
  a computer was n't something common at all , technology was more expensive back then , also we have been less people than today and even less interested in this kind of technology . 
  it was pretty much a big success . 
  speaking of pc , i remember the prices in '90 for something like ibm pc were incredibly high ( thousands of dollars ) . 
  that 's why i used '' ... '' , some data is missing because i do n't know those religion names in english , but on the original text is saying percent of total population . 
  well , i can only give some context with my country ( romania ) . 
  2011 census : orthodox 86.45 % , roman catholics 4.62 % , ... , greek catholics 0.8 % , ... , no religion 0.2 % , of the whole population . 
  who needs exercise here in romania when its 45 \u00b0 in the summer ? 
  we can * men * tion this in the eu parlia * men * t or trust the judg * men * t of our govern * men * ts to docu * men * t and com * men * t on the funda * men * tal rights of our wo * men * , recom * men * ding punish * men * t for * me * ntioning * men * struation . 
  a * men * . 
   after revolution , we had a lot of italian tv which was not translated in any way so people just learned italian from tv unrelated , you just reminded me of fantozzi movies i was watching back then . 
  the map says two and a half hours per week , not day . 
  it seems like it 's a map of most photographed places according to [sightsmap.com ] ( http://www.sightsmap.com/ ), 
  never anyone asked me if i do exercise so these statistics are probably based on gym membership , gym locations , purchase of whatever equipment to exercise and so on . 
  we also have lots people hiking ( lots of mountains here too ) and do other stuff like that , nobody is there to see me or ask me even . 
  considering 45 % of my country lives in rural areas , i 'd assume quite some of them work the land the hard way too , which it might not be considered in those statistics . 
  gym is also expensive and i do n't really see the point of it when nature seems better and free , and i do n't even know if people who work in factories even thought about it . 
  i do n't know , there are so many factors . 
  one day i 'd like a map of europe that shows how each country say netherland . 
  mine for example call it olanda . 
  especially when you move lots of low level jobs from west to east, 
  yea i was wondering the same , what exercise means in this context , because i live near mountains and take long walks and stuff , yet nobody ever asked me or my family if i do exercise . 
  if this is based on gym membership , well , no surprise , i do n't go to gym , as many others , and you pointed out why . 
  heh , percentage is a tricky thing . 
  look at our neighbors . 
  hungary alone has a higher percentage of gypsies than romania .
