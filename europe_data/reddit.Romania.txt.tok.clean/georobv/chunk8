  true and technically is not incorrect , as you said , but we usually say someone is german when he is from germany , as nationality , or born there . 
  we call them * sa\u0219i * ( saxons ) for that reason , same as we call our biggest minority * maghiari * or * secui * ( magyar/szekely ) and not hungarians . 
  well , why should i deny some of our roots , whatever they are ? 
  nationality is one thing , ethnicity is another . 
  he is born in romania and grew up here , therefore he is romanian , as nationality . 
  however , his ethnicity is saxon ( saxons are german minority that came in transylvania in like 12 century ) . 
  do n't mind the rest , they live in denial  yes , it 's not a balkan country but small part of the territory of romania is in the balkans . 
  more so than this , the majority of people in romania are so alike with the ones in the balkans ... 
  i do n't know why so many are afraid to be associated with the balkans . 
  the [ inside ] ( http://imgur.com/a/b4ozf ) is also nice . 
  btw , technically this is not a castle it 's a palace , we just call it peles castle . 
  lots of facts have been altered and hidden during our communist times . 
  only found out later from different sources/books . 
  i do n't really know what they teach the younger ones nowadays in school . 
  i guess it 's shown the dominating one by country and not region . 
  for accuracy , you are right , although we do n't have only straight catholics . 
  roman-catholics highest in harghita with 64 % ( covasna only 35 % , but covasna also have 32 % reformed , so not much orthodox ) . 
  other catholics , greek-catholics are highest in satu-mare , with only 7 % . 
  i 'd take your rant more serious if you were n't raging so much and spew out so much nationalistic nonsense . 
  your details are flowed and seen from your own perspective , and it 's just opinions that you believe that are facts . 
  you are the one who ignored my point , not the other way around , since you always twist the point in your nonsense direction . 
  every country has nationalism but not as retarded as in balkans , including romania . 
  yes , some in transylvania were also called vlach by outsiders , yet not everyone in transylvania was one of them , nor that they were romanians since the term romania did n't exist , only tara romaneasca which was obviously in the south . 
  good for you that because we had cleansing of different minorities ( saxons and jews were pretty big ) , and cleansing of the romanian language , today you can spew these nonsense opinions about how we are all romanians and this was always romania , making the other minorities to look like outsiders . 
  seems like the rewriting of our history in the school manuals and the propaganda that followed worked really well by creating so many obtuse nationalists . 
  by the way , reply to me when you actually make sense . 
  from what i remember we had mini revolutions ( i guess you can call them rebellions ) in '87 and '86 ( dunno about earlier ones ) , started by workers . 
  only the one in '89 spread throughout the country and succeeded . 
  really ? 
  disappointing !, 
  wall of text for nothing , you did n't even get my point , which was totally different . 
  i 'm also from transylvania and pretty sure a lot older than you , so i know pretty much what happens in transylvania . 
  besides that , no , vlachs from other countries are citizens of other countries and have the right to call themselves whatever the fuck they want and ask for whatever the fuck rights they want . 
  it 's not the romanians who should ask or decide what is good for them . 
  romania did n't exist when these people were over there . 
  just because we called ourselves romanians and romania later on , it does n't mean they have to follow . 
  they owe us nothing , they are free , even more , they are citizens of other country and they stay there by choice . 
  if they come to romania and they are recognized as romanians here , that 's great , but outside of romania we should n't decide for them if they do n't want ( and they do n't ) . 
  same as after roman empire every country went their own way , no latin country owe other latin country anything . 
  same as people from latin/south america would n't like to be pressured by countries from iberian peninsula . 
  these stupid nationalism we have in romania needs to die in a fire . 
   as for the fact most of them call themselves '' vlach '' that does not mean they are not romanian or do not speak romanian . 
  vlach preceded the term romanian or romania so it 's safe to say they are not romanian . 
  we went a different path , they went theirs . 
  the ones left in balkans do not have to follow us , they are citizens of a different country , with their own identity . 
  let them speak for themselves , we have no rights to do that for them . 
  it 's like all of the sudden hungary is the one that decides the rights of the magyars in transylvania and not romania , although they are romanian by nationality . 
  i 'm not okay with these double standards southern romanians everywhere , which on one hand would say `` fuck off to hungary if you want to speak magyar '' but they get very upset when something like vlachs in serbia apparently do n't call themselves romanian and speak romanian ( modern terms which they never have been in contact with ) . 
  that `` russian '' accent that is now in moldova ( our region and the republic ) originated in the north part of transylvania , from people who fled transylvania ( they even kept some of the old german words ) , influenced by the polish people who fled there , and the jews . 
  russian language just added a flavor later on in rm but it 's safe to say it is not the russian language who made that accent since we also have it to some extent in romania ( moldova , maramures ) . 
  officially , nobody knows . 
  practically , nobody knows if it was an influence or something else . 
  since only part of the south-west and center were occupied by romans , and by a total of 165 years ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_dacia ) , people speculated this in so many ways . 
   tell you anything about european history from 463-1452 out of context but i thought this is just a thing in my country . 
  i would genuinely want to know what happened between those years in my country as well . 
  maybe not that many years but from quite a few centuries , after the supposed dacian kingdom and romans who partially conquered the kingdom and left , there is nothing written and nothing known for some centuries . 
  we still do n't know how our language was formed and stuff like that . 
  my guess is because we were n't in eu in 2002 . 
  it 's possible to earn more but most people earn less than that , at least on paper . 
  it 's around 40 % of people that ear minimum wage per month , which in had is like 240 euros or something like that . 
  ca n't really compare to 400 . 
  btw , montenegro has one as well . 
  true but in romanian language we got it via russians ( unlike other words that we got directly from turkish or greek language ) and only moldova uses that word today . 
  and * pepene * ( watermelon ) in moldova is called * harbuz * , which is russian . 
   my point was that - in my humble and non-professional opinion - even if servus was used in central-eastern europe , it never became a german word . 
  it 's like one romanian youngster says to you `` thanks omule '' i understand what are you saying . 
  well , long story short , i heard many germans using the word ** servus ** so i guess for them it is a word like any other , since it 's quite an old word for germans , and not as new and foreign as it is `` thanks '' for us ( as you said , youngsters started using it more frequently ) . 
  as an example , we had a huge influence in romanian language from french language , that happened since 200 years ago i think . 
  because of that we have many french words ( estimated 20 % ) , which most of them are latin as origin ( obviously ) , but we took them from french language . 
  because of that , because it happened long ago for us , many words do n't feel foreign anymore ( also altered ) , unlike a word like `` thanks '' that still feels foreign and unfitting today . 
  even more recent words , you mentioned * sandvi\u0219 * , or even newer like * adida\u0219i * , are starting to not feel as foreign anymore , so imagine a word that actually survived hundred of years in the same country , you might not feel it foreign anymore . 
  in the end i guess it 's the same with ** servus ** in german language . 
  some of them use it , some of them do n't , as common as we use it in transylvania and not so much in the rest of the country . 
  for many years i 've lived in bucharest i have n't heard the word ** servus ** once , which further supports the germanic origin/influence , even if it 's not their word as origin but latin . 
  also , this is an word that has n't been altered much . 
  can you believe the word ** servus ** actually created the word ** ciao ** in italian ? 
  since servus means slave/servant , in italian is schiavo , which slowly turned into ciao . 
  so if we are to adopt the word ciao , it 's actually italian , but as origins it is latin . 
  the word ** servus ** is actually a very good example and i 'll explain later . 
  our dictionary place it as german because of the saxons that came along with it , even if the origins can be traced further , but i already said that . 
  if you go to germany today you will meet many people that use that word ( servus ) there and not particularly in other countries . 
  you are inclined to say that germans have nothing to do with latin . 
  well , the holy roman empire dissolved only in 1806 and included the whole germany , unlike today 's romania that have n't been under the old roman empire for almost two millennia . 
  they still used latin as official language in the holy roman empire . 
  the fact that some of the latin words are a loan from saxons/germans , even their origins can be traced further , is intended , to show which way the words came . 
  otherwise you can trace most of the words back to places like middle east or india . 
  some of the latin words came from greek , some of the slavic words ( including the alphabet ) came from greek , but even greek and latin words can be traced back even further . 
  this is why we call these languages indo-european . 
  so as i said , up to almost two hundreds years ago they still used latin in germany , hence the loan of ** anonymit\u00e4t ** , which is indeed latin but it came via saxons . 
  the english origin is also latin , but you can trace it back to greek ( as you said ** anonumos ** ) , but why stop there ? 
  you can trace it to sanskrit ( ** anamika ** ) . 
  want another simple example ? 
  the word ** nume ** ( english ** name ** ) is said to be latin ( ** nomen ** ) , but in sanskrit the exact same word is ** naama ** . 
  yes , you can trace lots of words back to ancient times but the dictionary have to show which way they came in . 
  no they do n't have monopoly . 
  by the way , the southern slavs also have it , not just russians . 
  anyway , quite some of the slavic words have asian origins , mostly sanskrit , but we mention the nearest origins , the ones that bought the word to us . 
  same for other origins , like turkish . 
  we have the word `` du\u0219man '' , it 's said in dictionary that it is of turkish origins , but if you trace it further is persian and you can find the word even further in india . 
  so in the end we specified the origins from where we took the word , not its deepest origins .
