  * report : romania looks towards record wine production this year . 
  * work begins on us missile defense system at deveselu . 
  * the protest against rosia montana mining project continues . 
  and another one is expected today . 
  you mean 0,1 % . 
  not a news for me . 
  i thought you would be interested . 
  ** romania ** * syrian businessman omar hayssam was brought in rahova to serve 20 years jail time for terrorism . 
  * the director of a news television ( antena 3 ) was summoned to the dna ( national anticorruption directorate ) for statements , as witnesses , in the file case opened against the antena group director sorin alexandrescu for blackmailing the manager of rcs & rds , one of the biggest telecommunication operators in south-eastern europe .

  gypsies ? 
  what gypsies ? 
  they are all yours now . 
  [ this has it all ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zxx7l9x.jpg ), 
  can confirm . 
  it seems like iord\u0103nescu is afraid to win . 
  the propaganda is strong , we must admit that . 
   mostly political involvement and being used by the governing party as a propaganda tool ~ ~ for the last 10 to 15 years ~ ~ since forever . 
  marine le pen is asked about the investigation of the french authorities and accuses the journalist of persecution , and being at a tv trial : ` it is a romanian court ' . 
  then she reponds , and blames francois hollande : ` for me it is an honor . 
  it is an honor to be persecuted by those in power ', 
  and say good news !, 
  instead of hi !, 
  this is not a bad plan . 
  do you know why ? 
  this is true . 
  that means he has the majority of politicians from chi\u0219in\u0103u in his pocket , and i doubt it . 
  not so much , and it melted right away . 
  but he as to live there 10 years before running for office . 
  it snowed last night in bucharest too . 
  this is hard to translate , because in this sentence \u00eenainte means both forward and backward . 
  so , the translation will be like this : we go forward , because backwards was better . 
  this looks like heaven .

  romania , in 1990-1991 , was under [ the mineriads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu#mineriads ) and stuff like oppressing her own people .

  you meet a refugee for the first time , how do you know who is who ? 
  the average price is 25 lei , around 6 dollars . 
  yep, 
  it must be in praga . 
  no way !, 
  you serious ? 
  well , on behalf of romanians , thank you for your support . 
  i had a good opinion but victor ponta ruined it . 
  joke aside , i heard a lot of stories from romanians who worked in italy that ` they were even worse than us ' . 
  something something soros . 
  if it matters , i wanted to play against you at euro 2016 . 
  so ... if you want to like you even more eliminate the visas . 
  sure . 
  now gib mony, 
  my guess is that the ottomans occupied wallachia . 
  and also erdogan . 
  i lived in poland and they were friendly . 
  yeah but did you send your gold to moscow and never heard a thing about it ?

  why not bring the moon in russia ? 
  this should be legal in the future . 
  the man is paid shit , and the woman is paid shitty . 
  probably . 
  i see that romania is mentioned in the wiki article but i do n't know about this tradition on this day . 
  i 've seen it when in poland though , it was nice btw . 
  in romania we do this on easter eve , when lots of people go to church and cemetery . 
  so that 's why our country is safer . 
  come and visit !, 
  since you are from hungary ( / s ) it takes a few minutes . 
  no sarmale , such is life . 
  oh , yes please !, 
   as a sidenote . 
  romania just lost around 150 mil euros from eu for not building at least 4 hospitals but we managed to build thousands of churches . 
  not yet , but soon we 'll lose the money . 
  we are pretty much the same on religion . 
  some did . 
  one said on facebook that he would like to wipe barbu 's glasses with his dusty boots . 
  [ and today four romanian soldiers were injured in afghanistan .
