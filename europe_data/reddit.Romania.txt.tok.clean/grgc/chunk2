  the same idea is advanced by the psd ( the version of pis in poland ) , that the judges need to be protected from prosecutors of the national anticorruption directorate , so that 's why they intend to pass a law in the parliament . 
  it 's absurd .

  let 's just not give the young/old people argument . 
  old people voted for psd , but there are also many that protested last night . 
  not only him . 
  ion iliescu too !, 
  i think psd will back down , and will wait the referendum . 
  at least this is the logical step to do if you do n't want a bigger protest . 
  this is the biggest protest in years , in romania . 
  you are both right . 
  at least 20000,

  a historical , but romantisized event , would have taken place probably during the early years dimitrie cantemir 's rule in moldavia , during the latter part of the 17th century and early 18th century . 
  the story is as following : on their way back after raiding moldavia , the 25 000 men-strong army of polish king john iii sobieski came across cetatea neam\u0163ului , defended by less than 20 men . 
  the poles attacked the stronghold , believing that it contained necessary provisions . 
  after over a week of siege , the small moldavian garrison surrendered . 
  legend has it that , moved by the determined opposition from such a minuscule force , the polish monarch granted life and free passage to the moldavians in the garrison and gave them ranks in the polish army . 
  although a few historians contest the authenticity of this legendary siege , it nevertheless had a very important place in 19th century romanian consciousness , finding its most popular version in costache negruzzi 's novelette called sobieski \u015fi rom\u00e2nii ( sobieski and the romanians : the title in itself indicates his attitude towards the events described ) , but also in the poem cetatea neam\u0163ului by george cosbuc .

  military prosecutors have decided , on friday , to start a criminal inquest , under the aspect of committing crimes against humanity , against former president ion iliescu , former prime minister petre roman and former director of the romanian intelligence service virgil magureanu , in the case regarding the ` mineriad ' of june 13-15 , 1990 . 
  furthermore , placed under criminal investigation were gelu voican voiculescu , former deputy pm in romania 's interim government ; nicolae dumitru , former first deputy of the national salvation front ( e.n. 
  -- the body that exerted all power in the period immediately following the december 1989 revolution , later a political party ) , general ( ret . ), 
  mugurel cristian florescu , former deputy of romania 's prosecutor general and head of the military prosecutors ' offices directorate . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad ) : the mineriads ( romanian : mineriad\u0103 ) were a series of violent demonstrations by jiu valley miners in bucharest during the 1990s , particularly 1990 -- 91 . 
  the term `` mineriad '' alone is mostly used to refer to the most violent protest , which occurred june 13 -- 15 , 1990 . 
  during the 1990s , the jiu valley miners played a visible role in romanian politics , and their protests reflected inter-political and societal struggles in post-revolution romania . 
  june 1990 mineriad the romanian miners of jiu valley were called by the newly elected power to bucharest to end the riots that broke up on 13 june 1990 . 
  as president ion iliescu put it , the miners were called to save the `` besieged democratic regime '' and restore order and democracy in bucharest . 
  the government trucked in thousands of miners from the jiu valley to bucharest to confront the demonstrators . 
  the rest of romania and the world watched the government television broadcasts of miners brutally grappling with students and other protesters . 
  over the course of a month-long demonstration in university square , many protesters had gathered with the goal of attaining official recognition for the 8th demand of the popular proclamation of timi\u0219oara , which stated that communists and former communists ( including president iliescu himself ) should be prevented from holding official functions . 
  many people , most of them intellectuals , were dissatisfied with iliescu 's first government , made up mostly of former communists , because it implemented reforms very slowly or not at all . 
  there had been a protest and hunger strike since 20 may , the general elections day , when the protesters were angry that iliescu 's fsn won the elections mostly because the opposition had no chance to mount an effective campaign , and that former communists were in power -- the only other country of the ex-soviet bloc in which this happened was bulgaria , where the bulgarian socialist party won a 52.7 % majority . 
  some among the protesters in university square grew violent and attacked the police headquarters and the national television station . 
  when the police were unable to contain the violence , iliescu appealed to the miners to defend the country . 
  special trains transported some 10,000 miners to the capital , where the miners violently confronted anyone they saw as opposing the government . 
  the official figures say that during the third mineriad , seven people were killed and more than a thousand were wounded . 
  the opposition newspaper rom\u00e2nia liber\u0103 claimed that on 29 june 1990 over 40 bodies were buried in a common grave in str\u0103ule\u0219ti , near bucharest . 
  conspiracy theories and rumors circulated as to the origins and development of the mineriad , with some believing that both the romanian presidency and secret service had a hand in it . 
  later parliamentary inquiries into the potential role of the secret service contributed to the widespread public mistrust of the post-ceau\u0219escu intelligence service . 
  government inquiries would show that the miners had indeed been `` joined by vigilantes who were later credibly identified as former officers of the securitate '' , and that for two days , the miners had been aided and abetted by the former securitate members in their violent confrontation with the protesters and other targets . 
  the reason romanians are outraged is that she is close to dragnea .
