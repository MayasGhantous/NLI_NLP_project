not that easy . 
  it 's about the money . 
  private universities are reluctant to lose students because they lose money . 
  so , they accept large number of students in the first year , make the exams easy and keep the money flowing in , and even look the other way if you still canot pass an exam without cheating . 
  the result is graduates who ca n't even spell properly . 
  so the general idea is : so , you have a degree , so what , even a retard can get a degree nowdays . 
  it 's because of the `` inflation '' of degrees . 
  in romania anyone who wants a degree can get it . 
  and so , in the eyes of most people it means nothing any more . 
  and actually it 's contrary . 
  we are much more likely to let criminals loose than convinct innocent . 
  it time you will see . 
  i just hope it 's not too late . 
  well , from my understanding it 's not * unregulated * immigration but * encouraged * immigration . 
  and that in itself would not be a bad thing . 
  but there is a difference between * you can go to sweden , work hard and make a decent life * and * you can go to sweden , collect benefits and earn a little extra from begging *, 
  when i posted this there were only 2 comments , all beggining with  as a romanian followed by nothing meanigfull :  i 'm not sure how i feel about this . 
  and  i 'm so tired of this shit , i wish i could put it into words . 
  so it was a joke . 
  as a romanian , i have nothing to contribute , can i have some comment karma too ? 
  i see . 
  thanks . 
  my toughts exactly . 
  was n't the eu that suggested this ? 
  fuck the quota legislation . 
  why do n't they legislate a quota for miners , janitors and lumberjacks also ? 
  thanks for the reply , that is the reason why i keep seeing the magic number : 3 kids . 
  it seems to me like a good policy to support ( directly or indirectly ) couples to have more children . 
  i tought of that . 
  for sure that is the case . 
  however i know quite a few french couples that have 3 children , and that is quite rare in other coutries today . 
  i keep hearing that france has a great system to encourage couples to have more children . 
  can somebody explain if that is so , and how it works ? 
  aha , thanks . 
  first of all , where did you get the info that konrad adenauer or hanns seidel get money from the german taxpayers ? 
  they are fundations that can use the money donated to them as they see fit . 
  thanks man . 
  but please keep in mind that milions of romanians emigrated to spain italy germany even greece . 
  if these floks reached germany it 's unlikely they will accept romania . 
  this is why i always laugh when i see all this talk about romania 's quota . 
  these people will not come here . 
  let him ( jokoon ) be . 
  notice that he starts :  she might be provocative but then :  if you deliberately provoke  if she 's getting provocative he has already established that the lady is provocative with zero evidence . 
  you can not reason with such people . 
   virtually ignores everyone from the presidential party ( pnl ) [ really ? 
  ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/romania/andrei-chiliman-arrived-at-the-supreme-court-the-mayor-of-district-1-could-be-arrested-297647.html ), 
  well , that 's kind of the definition of discrimination is n't it ? 
  i was making fun of your comment exactly because this situation is far from simple . 
  * they are discriminated because they do bad things . 
  * they do bad thing because they are discriminated and so they have little choice . 
  while - repeat it 's not that easy to break this cycle . 
  it requires actions on multiple levels . 
  you come here and say  we should stop discriminating against them yeah , we should . 
  but it 's never that simple in real life . 
  whoa dude !, 
   we should stop discriminating against them so that the problem is solved . 
  why the hell did n't we think of this earlier !, 
  and most importantly : he created that service from nothing , with volunteers and donations only . 
  only years later , when the state realized that there was a parallel system working way better than the state one , they decided to join forces . 
  obviously . 
  imo it 's better to inform people about what 's going on in romania rather than insult them . 
  they do n't have a clue . 
  as for the efforts in tackling corruption : mai e mult pana departe . 
  no offense taken . 
  baby steps . 
  2 years ago a guy of this caliber would have been practically above the law . 
  progress is slow , but i hope that it is certain . 
  you said they were low level . 
  i listed the former ministers only . 
  i do not have the time to compile a list of mps , mayors etc. 
  these guys are not low level . 
  higher than the prime minister is only the president . 
  he also may follow . 
  that is as high as you can get .

  to answer your question . 
  the first effect is that almost all state investing has stopped . 
  apparently they do n't know how to award a contract without bribe because for now they stopped awarding contracts . 
  on the other hand , the government introduced some pretty good tax deductions . 
  we have to see what happens next with them , considering the finance minister that supported them is now under investigation . 
  i am afraid it 's not few . 
  you will see bastards from all the political spectrum trying to exploit grief for their political gain . 
  and romanian refineries are designed so they can process oil with a high sulfur content . 
  as is the case with most oil from arab states . 
  i just hope they will not be using this as en excuse to enter syria . 
  yes . 
  this also means that some people made a lot of money today . 
  there might not be a conventional war , but in light of recent events we are a bit stressed about `` lost russian tourists '' . 
  ever considered making classes more appealing to boys ? 
  as opposed to the current `` sit down and shut up '' ? 
  is this for real ? 
  i mean , seriously , did someone make such an argument in a court of law ? 
  is this the onion ? 
  yes . 
  in my opinion this led to the out vote : anyone who says stop imigration is a racist ? 
  really ? 
  nobody listens to what these people want ? 
  they are racists and that is all ?
