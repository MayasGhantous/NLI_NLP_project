'' ... portuguese think ... '' - spot the error in less than 5 seconds / s, 
  they seem pretty educated to me , bro !, 
  it 's ok . 
  they ask the same thing about kazakhstan , which has been richer ( gdp per capita at ppp ) than both belarus and romania since 2000 or so . 
  apparently news arrives slower over there . 
  / s aside , you should really [ watch out for those sneaky slavs ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:prt:rom:pol:svn:svk&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) ... they 'll turn you into poortugal asap :d, 
  the netto hourly minimum wage in ro is approx . 
  the downside is that you actually have to work for it ... 
  when senpai finally notices you !, 
  a few more steps and you can into nordic too !, 
  `` disgust '' - care to point to a source ? 
  please stop ... 
  i can only get so erect !!!, 
  :p :d ( even though bucharest will never have the imperial charm and utter beauty of budapest ), 
  the odd moment when your country fairs much better than expected  . 
  it 's never too late to put a crook behind bars !, 
  ( not saying he 's guilty before the actual trial or anything ), 
  you also seem to be missing some other ingredients that have been [ fueling 2nd world economies ] ( https://www.google.by/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:rom:bgr:hun&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ukr:rom:hun:bgr:hrv:srb:blr:rus:pol&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) in the past two decades . 
  a better question would be why russia , belarus and moldova are n't ? 
  the same methodology is used all over the eu : ** `` unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who were without work during the reference week , but who are currently available for work and were either actively seeking work in the past four weeks or had already found a job to start within the next three months . 
  '' ** ( source : [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lfs/methodology/main-concepts ) ) . 
  as a personal side note , * `` the real unemployment rate is probably around 20 % '' * - you should generally back up such claims with hard facts and statistics . 
  those who are living in mostly rural/small urban areas and working as farmers and/or on-and-off seasonal workers in the west do n't count as unemployed . 
  i 'm pretty sure that after the recent terrorist attacks , most romanians ( at least most of those i know ) think that france ca n't take care of itself for the time being , let alone help others in need . 
  poland is actually the economic development model several of our government officials have pointed to in the recent past . 
  and , imho , it 's a very good one at that . 
  i personally took it as something funny , not offensive  but thank you anyway !, 
  maybe somebody can confirm this but in poland to call somebody a `` rumun '' is actually one of the greatest offenses ( it 's basically the equivalent of calling somebody a `` tigan '' in romania ) . 
  this basic language aspect is a general thing that influences 100 % of the population . 
  the fact that we helped save their army from obliteration in ww2 ( and part of their national treasury from the nazis and the russians ) is perhaps less known and emphasized . 
  : spelling edit . 
  if europe 's natives were all racist bigots , the ww2 death camps would be classified as industrial parks rather than museums . 
  thank you !, 
  what happened in romania ( bucharest i guess from the map ) ? 
  i think you 're just as ready as we or bulgaria were . 
  the only thing is ... the invitation to join is 100 % political when you 're below the stated criteria ... and the climate in the eu is not pro-expansion right now . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't read the introduction properly . 
  could you ask somebody from malta about this ? 
  my experience is that they 're almost all speaking english over there but some people are more proficient than others . 
  thus , it 's one of the few places in europe where adding extra english subtitles to english movies would make sense on a wider level . 
  as a side note , would the [ technologies described in this article ] ( http://www.gizmag.com/personal-hearing-fraunhofer-deaf/37818/ ) help you ? 
  `` subtitled in english '' = the movies is original / dubbed in another language ( i.e. , german , french , italian , mandarin ) and you want to see the english translation in text ( at the bottom of the screen ) ? 
  are you perhaps looking for movies in the original ( english ) language that are just subtitled in another language ( but not dubbed ) ? 
  if so , romania is definitely such a place , but you can definitely catch an ov ( original version ) screening in many other countries as well ( germany , austria , czech republic , switzerland etc. ), 
  if you want to look at something far more `` scientific '' ( and realistic imho ) , you might be interested int the [ global peace index ] ( http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/global-peace-index ) and the [ terrorism index ] ( http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/terrorism-index ) from the institute for economics and peace . 
  ## ** wrong !, 
  ** ^ ^ ^ trademark, 
  smoke what ? 
  you are right , unfortunately . 
  but it 's still worth remembering that they failed themselves first !, 
  and then they failed everybody else when instead of facing the shit hole they dug themselves into for 30 years , the elected syriza and went from begging to aggressive begging and blackmail !, 
  you 're missing the point really . 
  the issue was not a loose interpretation of eu food regulations on behalf of romania . 
  the issue was that a greedy and shady dutch company bought cheap horse meat and sold it off as expensive calf meat . 
  if the said outfit have been a romanian company , you might have used the syntagm `` corrupt eastern eu firm undermining perfect eu regulations '' . 
  since it was dutch , you can go with `` dishonest '' or even `` slightly misinforming '' practices that `` bend perfect eu regulation '' . 
  i 'm a simple man . 
  i see post-communist development , i up vote !, 
  they deserve it for leaving the eu . 
  take it as a warning britain !, 
  estonia and latvia can into nordic and poland can into baltic . 
  so much win !, 
  will the box contain an european passport ? 
  i think they 'll bomb them even more out of spite . 
  it is russia after all !, 
  i was just pointing out to the fact that half the news are about russia . 
  and half of the remaining about brexit . 
  it 's good to live in such uneventful times on the continent  . 
  they 're like 5 of them on hot just now . 
  guess it 's bash russia day again ... 
  let us teach you  and you 'll fake the numbers better than the greeks in no time, 
  this was exactly my point !, 
  i like your idea better ! , but i would lose my bingo point ... :(, 
  let 's play brexit bingo !, 
  whenever a piece of brexit-related news lands on the hot page of / r/europe , you get 1 point for each main comment . 
  if you 're the first one to reach 15 in two days , you win !, 
  i have a head start with this one . 
  ours is ( largely ) the same ... there are some bright spots here and there but as soon as election season starts , people generally choose to elect into office the same incompetent and/or corrupt characters as always . 
  the anti-corruption drive was mainly pushed for and heavily supported by the eu and the us . 
  i 'm not saying that it is not a success , but it is a success obtained despite the mentality of the average romanian , not because of it . 
  and , is that a good thing or a bad one ? 
  i for one , would fire the entire forecasting department for such a `` slight error in estimations '' . 
  you know , english has been the first foreign language for every single romanian pupil in the past 25 years ( if not even more ) . 
  that alone should be a good indicator of the appeal the uk might have for some of my countryman that decide to seek better fortune elsewhere . 
  on a different note ( and please do n't take it the wrong way ) , does the uk government make such estimations for other ethnicities as well ( like indian , pakistani , bangladeshi , middle eastern ) ? 
  do you , perhaps , have a source for this ? 
  only if you plan to visit those countries or buy a lot of stuff from them ( now ) . 
  if you export stuff to those countries , you just gained a huge productivity boom against competitors from 3rd party countries that also want to export similar stuff there . 
  i would guess it sends a strong message that the uk is still relevant world-wide and especially on the continent and that it can still muster the brawn to get things done , especially with countries it sees as beneath its level . 
  the wto has over 160 members and britain will face hard negotiations with the big players ( russia , china , brazil , india , south korea ) . 
  i do n't think it affords to get bogged down with black mail attempts/cheeky requests from small players . 
  so , setting an early example would be effective . 
  on the other side , maybe my supposition of the shakedown is wrong  for now , it was the only semi-logic reason i saw for the uk to behave like this in a time they would need as many world-wide allies and friends as possible in order to negotiate good brexit terms with the eu . 
  i think they can delay it for as long as they 're still in the eu : at least 2 more years . 
  * her * lieberaum * in this context i think, 
  great minds think alike  , ... or so i 've been told ( guess the old roman appetite for intrigue and mistrust is genetically inheritable ), 
  you are technically right !, 
  i think the `` up to '' part was lost upon many of the readers of [ such press gems ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2252675/were-way-britain-in-year-29-million-romanians-bulgarians-right-settle-britain-claim-benefits-and-gipsy-community-hardly-wait-here.html ) ... myself included ... 
  the japanese might beg to differ on that . 
  no , it was in the contemporary sense , but not only related to the article and the uk ( see the british referendum , the presidential run-off in the states , the immigrant rhetoric in eu , etc. ) .
