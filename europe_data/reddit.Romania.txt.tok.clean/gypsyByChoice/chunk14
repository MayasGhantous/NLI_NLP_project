  you should read my comment again , check a little history and population-statistics on wikipedia and then maybe you 'll understand my point . 
  uhhhh !, 
  look at all those well-spread nuclear testing grounds . 
  sadly , there is something called the republic of moldova on the map of europe that through its very existence combats every argument in your comment . 
   yes you were , you said ** part ** of the problem comes from the fact we have lots of gypsies , which is n't true of course they are part of the problem if they make up 4 % out of the 32 % . 
  a 12.5 % part to be more precise . 
  and of course they are generally to blame if they resist the obligations of modern life in most of its aspects but expect its benefits . 
  and the main flaw in your line of arguments that the government should do this or do that , is that you seem to forget that many rural people prefer shitting in their back yard ( as is tradition ) since this is free of charge while indoor plumbing is a service that you pay for monthly ( sadly , i speak from experience here ) . 
  our cities might have helped the country surpass croatia in gdp per capita at ppp but most of our rural areas are firmly stuck in the 18th century regarding both mentality and economic output . 
   freedom of speech is more important than not hurting feelings of course it is . 
  that 's why members of parliament usually have protection for their political statements . 
  stopping the spread of hate is not about hurting feelings now , is it ? 
  it 's about deterring the next historical step from stereotype to genocide . 
  you look it up !, 
  it 's a big part of making a convincing argument . 
  i tend to look up for things that support my point of view or challenge it in a meaningful manner . 
  one ( or several ) minor mistakes made by applying the law in a bad way do n't convince me that germany is a police state bent on enforcing political correctness and `` progressive '' views at any price . 
  mutti 's recent u-turn on the asylum policy and sdp 's recent drop in the polls enforce my view that ( on average ) even germans slowly start to recognize the sheer stupidity of their previous migration policy . 
  laws . 
  this is a [ good starting point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech#germany ) for more info on the subject . 
   28 % who missed indoor plumbing [ it 's really not that big of a problem in rural communities ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/23/1-6-million-americans-dont-have-indoor-plumbing-heres-where-they-live/?utm_term=.2865059cfa5f ) . 
  they survived like this for thousands of years and the situation is [ slowly improving ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tessi294&amp;plugin=1 ) all over the country . 
  i 'm not making them scapegoats . 
  but i also do n't feel like ignoring this ethnic group has a huge integration problem ( all over eastern europe ) . 
  and , for us particularly , the integration problem is also due to the current and [ the historical actions ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/societate/in-numele-statului-1_5981a7595ab6550cb8afe949/index.html ) of the romanian state and the majority . 
   also if we had competent politicians who actually tried to solve problems , gypsies would n't be in such a bad situation in the first place . 
  that 's why i 'm saying i do n't blame all our problems on them . 
  not even a majority of them . 
  but if they are 5 % of the population , you can bet that they account for 4-4 .5 % of those 32 % . 
  as for the politicians , we have exactly the type of politicians that we deserve as a country ( voting is free after all and representation is proportional ) . 
   people getting arrested for wanting a different , more nationally focused , immigration policy expressed in racist / hateful manner , more often than not . 
  i 'm not blaming them for everything . 
  but their communities are the ones that are the most likely to simultaneously score in the all the self-bashing categories mentioned in the post . 
  it 's not like they have a propensity for education , self enlightenment and obeying the law . 
  quite the contrary . 
  well , the main concern at the moment is migrants coming from libya . 
  and that war was started by france as i remember it . 
  actually the india in europe is likely responsible for ~ ~ a lot ~ ~ a few percentages on each of these stats , just like [ it is likely responsible for this statistic concerning czechia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6neuuv/why_central_and_eastern_european_children_lag/ ) . 
   romanian government spent money on stuff that improves the standard of living for romanian people sadly , we do n't have that option for now . 
  the current government has only two default modes : ( 1 ) steal shit and ( 2 ) obey ( a ) eu or ( b ) american orders . 
  option number ( 2 ) is not the default one as the government adopts it reluctantly in order to ( a ) keep receiving eu funds that bolster the economy so that there is more shit to steal and ( b ) make sure russia does n't steal the shit first . 
  the increase in military spending is an obvious case of ( 2 ) ( b ) . 
  i 'm not saying they are lazy . 
  i 'm saying their ( sometimes hard ) work is in vain in romania as it only benefits the feudal lords they desperately vote for at every election . 
  it 's a vicious circle of underdeveloped and uneducated people that are being used to gain power and privilege , power and privilege that are then used to keep them uneducated and underdeveloped . 
   oh , really ? 
  46 % say they 'd vote for ceau\u0219escu . 
  i said soviet . 
  a hard-core communist like you should know the difference . 
  it 's the foremost job of any state to provide security . 
  however unpopular this opinion might be in europe , healthcare is not on the same level , except some basics . 
  a lot of the issues you mention are also due to a poor work ethic and the fact that half of the country lives in similar socio-economic conditions to those in the 18th century ( subsistence farming and feudal lordship of local `` politicians '' ) and is unwilling to change `` its traditional views '' and voting patterns . 
  the other half is quite competitive ( given the part of europe where it resides in ) . 
  neither halves have fond memories of the good ol' soviet times , though . 
  [ our military spending for 2016 was 2.816 billion dollars ( nominal ) - approx 1.5 % of our gdp . 
  the one of sweden was 5.344 billion ] ( https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/milex-constant-2015-usd.pdf ) . 
  romania has an area of 238.397 square kilometers . 
  sweden has an area of 450.295 square kilometers . 
  we spent 11.81 million dollars to defend 1 square km of territory . 
  you spent 11.86 million dollars to defend 1 square km . 
  we 're part of nato and theoretically rely on a few allies . 
  you 're not . 
   germany and france have similar issues with democracy no they actually do n't . 
  there 's quite a big difference between having a different opinion ( even an unpopular one ) and spreading hate . 
  in light of their tragic modern history , germans in particular are quite good at spotting this difference . 
  unfortunately , because of that same history , they also have a stupid bias towards a `` willkommenskultur '' that can be abused at will . 
  i would beg to differ . 
  the country has virtually no history of democratic rule and quite a lot of its people only respect having a strongman in power . 
  it will be very hard to make such a country obey the eu 's principles ( even against popular will ) as the eu is barely able to do this with romania and bulgaria and apparently not able/willing to do this with hungary and poland . 
  thank you !, 
  i think he meant citizenship , not ethnicity . 
   if there is interest there is !, 
  i think you misspelled fire bombing . 
  yeeeeeeyyy !!!, 
  we won !!, 
  have n't given it proper thought , but my immediate reaction would be to say yes in the case of people with a dual citizenship ( romanian + other ) . 
  i say it for all the ethnic groups that live in romanian and claim the citizenship of this country . 
   my entire point either you do n't make any new points relevant to the discussion . 
  you say `` nation '' , i say `` ethnic group '' . 
  slight difference in common description , huge difference in interpretation ( at least for us romanians ) due to the historic and social background . 
  that 's why our constitution is worded in the way it is and i was pointing out to france just to show you that the practice is not only common to romania . 
   the french do it too so that makes it true stop making stupid claims and attributing them to me . 
  this is not how you prove points and win arguments . 
   racist flamebaiting if it were true , it would still be xenophobic . 
  last time i checked , we were both part of the `` caucasian race '' . 
  no i 'm not . 
  i 'm arguing that there is a difference between `` nation '' and `` ethnicity '' , especially when considering the highest law of the land . 
  and our constitution is modeled ( translated ) from the french one ( that was designed to `` accommodate '' corsican and breton views on ethnic-based separatism ) . 
  i do because i live in romania . 
  others ( that are not so well versed in eastern european history and culture ) might believe we are a multi-nation state based on this map . 
   and this excuse it 's not an excuse . 
  this is the fact . 
  we 're not a multi-nation state but we are a multi-ethnic one ( like most in europe ) . 
   op made a mistake with titling hence the comments  ), 
  well , nearly all of those i 've met while living in transylvania are . 
  but i 'm not from harcov so maybe there is a big social bubble . 
  it 's mentions `` nations '' not `` languages '' in the title of the post . 
  it it was obviously about languages , i would n't have so much problem with a wrongly placed color . 
  i bet they do . 
  but maybe they do n't form a separate `` nation '' inside slovakia .
