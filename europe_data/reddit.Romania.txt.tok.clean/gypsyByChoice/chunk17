  although not in this `` primitive '' form , `` taxing '' full factory automation and redistributing this money in order to alleviate some of the huge social-issues that will appear seems to be a very logical approach . 
  they are obvious populists ( and i do mean it in a pejorative way ) that declare themselves solely focused on the `` ignored little man '' while having their eye on `` lucrative business '' leading to the bankruptcy of hypo and carinthia . 
  they were also initially anti-foreigners in general but pivoted/moderated to anti-muslims in order to gain traction among the yugoslavian diaspora in austria . 
  the were anti-eu and anti-euro and now they moderate as well . 
  this however does not mean that they are wrong on all issues . 
  their stance on the undocumented immigration wave was arguably among the saner ones in europe . 
  do they mean mechanical robots or german citizens ( aka piefke ) in general ? 
  well , they are called ** popu ** lists for a reason . 
  apparently the eu and the euro are still more ** popular ** than they assumed . 
  more economically free than japan ? 
  is this index for real ? 
  i also find it very hard to believe that the state of the media in bulgaria is that much worse than in serbia . 
  at which point the uk will choose not pay a dime and simply smile and wave !, 
  on the bright side , we 're better than all our neighbors . 
  on the negative side , we 're better than all our neighbors ( that are also european ) . 
  wtf ? 
  of course they would n't , as long as no russian tanks are ( / planning to become ) stationary in their country . 
  if that were not the case , i guess most citizens of that eu country ( let alone politicians and people with vested interests ) would call him a `` champion of the the entire ( free ) world '' if he would just dispatch one division of marines to their soon-to-be-forever-indebted-lands . 
  begging is an art form , my friend . 
  just ask our latest gdp/capita and hdi reports . 
   selling aa blatant lie in a presentable way i would argue that this is the job description of most politicians out there  . 
  but you are right , nevertheless . 
  i did before posting  . 
   i do n't much care about the things ** other ** people fantasized about have you passed reading comprehension ? 
  i 'm not claiming anything . 
  you asked for an estimation . 
  i gave you one . 
  i do n't much care about the things other people fantasized about on this sub or on big red buses  ) . 
  i 'm actually eager to see the results of this massive-scale socio-economic experiment . 
  in the end , only history ( think decades ) will be a good judge of brexit , the arguments surrounding it and who was right or wrong and to what degree . 
  not really . 
  1.5 million people in germany also rely on food banks . 
  why is it that only in england and the us being poor seems to be a disgrace ? 
  paywall, 
  that 's the lowest timeline that would make any sense . 
  till then , the uk is in the eu economic framework . 
  after that , we 'll see . 
  and i do n't wish for anything bad to happen to the uk economy ( now or in the future ) since they are an important ally and historically supportive of democracy and rule of law . 
  it 's just that a crisis is actually not to be expected until the uk truly leaves the trade bloc . 
  roughly 2 years at least ? 
  ... her appearance , public conduct and positioning seem to indicate so . 
  at least to me . 
  i would n't . 
  better be on good terms with the saner part of trump 's cabinet . 
  if you do n't get the joke/innuendo , maybe you 're ... kinda ' ... dumb and should refrain from commenting, 
  so why would people vote for them instead of the spd ? 
  are they on the far left of the political spectrum ( at least economy-wise ) ? 
  to their defense , news arrives much slower in that part of the world . 
  i see . 
  i apologize then !, 
  and you call yourself a journalist  ? 
  is n't political pundit a bit closer to the truth ? 
  well , the sort-by-new default is applied only to delicate threads like this one . 
  the other ones are kept on best/top . 
  it 's just my opinion . 
  no need to get so defensive and involve even more religion into the argument  . 
  i see that the mystery of using the magical symbols '' '' still eludes you . 
  to disperse the `` hate views '' . 
  they usually build support quite fast and remain visible when sorting via top/best . 
  this is a kind of mild censorship via sorting ( might come to a facebook wall near you in the short run ) . 
  no , it does not . 
  you also have to combine it with ppp and the distribution of financial gains between capital and workforce income to get a cleared picture of who is actually better off . 
  i 'm not mixing them up , i 'm simply arguing that the two are inherently inter-mixed and can not be untangled as easily as you argue . 
  i believe that the `` true worth '' associated with any economy is ( most ) objectively gauged by the standard of living that it offers/delivers to the people that work in it and not by some artificial metric ( call it $ , euro or pound sterling ) that also encompasses access to trade , subjective beliefs regarding value and stability in times of war , etc. 
  and when it comes to assessing standards of living , ppp is a must and that is why ppp is also extremely useful ( but not necessarily a must ) when comparing gdp figures . 
  in the case of the eu , with its stated goal of convergence , nominal gdp actually makes a lot of sense but ppp gdp also makes a lot of ( if not even more ) sense across other contexts !, 
  it 's not only bmw . 
  bavaria is one of the historic economic heartlands of europe . 
  the b in bmw comes from bavaria ( n ) ... 
  if eating , drinking and generally living is not reality enough , than yes . 
   the migration patterns are not strictly correlated with wealth . 
  you have to consider the sociocultural conditions of that country . 
  if speaking about two countries no . 
  considering that there are hardly any saudis working in any `` nominally more productive '' economies ( us , canada , northern and western europe , australia , etc. 
  ) , i would argue that ppp plays a big role . 
   gdp per capita is not a measure of standard of living but just of how much an economy is worth no argument here . 
  a minor argument is that using ( nominal but also ppp ) gdp to compare the `` true '' productivity of different regions would only make sense when considering at least the same currency and very similar tax and administration related measures ( even inside the same country ) . 
  romania , for example , is very centralized . 
  that 's why bucharest and its suburbs appear brighter on your map . 
  if bucharest were to declare independence from romania , i can guarantee that those gdp values would drop fast because they do n't only indicate how much the economy of bucharest is worth , they also integrate how much the `` centralized '' approach is able to `` milk '' ( in terms of gdp ) from providing and managing access to the overall resources of romania . 
   eh , with qatar the example did n't work :d it worked , but it 's harder to make the point if somebody appears to be 1.5 times more well-off than you or 3.2 times . 
  while the difference from 0.5 to 1.3 might be more telling why there is no significant saudi diaspora working in the uk , a country that is nominally 50 % better off than theirs . 
  i edited the previous reply and also added the saudis . 
  while when moving from nominal to ppp , qatar only extends its advantage over the uk ( from 1.5 to 3.2 ) when it comes to the market value of its overall production , the saudis overtake the uk ( from 0.5 to 1.3 ) . 
  which one seems closer to the truth : is the average saudi half as `` productive '' as the average brit or slightly more `` productive '' ( or on par ) ? 
   if your example was realistic yes , it would . 
  but in reality it has n't because ali 's country is n't wealthy and popolous ( it 's not even near richer and wealthier countries , like for example it happens in the eu ) enough to meet economies of scale and making ali 's factory prosper . 
  ali 's factory would be a so called `` cathedral in the desert '' , and almost literally . 
  now replace water with oil and invert the ease of producing it in my example ( and move water towards foodstuffs ) and you have a very realistic example why i would not use nominal gdp per capita to compare the uk with , let 's say , qatar or saudi arabia ( mind the desert change )  ) . 
   gdp aims to measure the value of an economy . 
  check value added , it ca n't be adjusted ppp well , i do n't really find your arguments regarding this convincing because ( economic ) `` value '' is not objective ( based on a universal constant or something like this ) and depends on an overall spatial and temporal context . 
  since you seem to have a propensity for basic analogies , i would argue that a bottle of water in the middle of the sahara is valued ( in $ ) at a much higher rate than a bottle of water in a the midlands . 
  hence , the added value produced by ali ( that is `` producing '' and selling this item in the sahara ) is higher than that of john ( that sells and `` produces '' it in the uk ) . 
  however , with the money gained from selling the water , both ali and john need to buy food . 
  not very surprisingly , food produced and sold in the sahara is also far more expensive than food produced and sold in the uk . 
  this might mean that : - john could actually buy more food than ali , even though the former is `` less productive in nominal terms '' at his job ( of producing and selling water ) . 
  - assuming a simple economy made only from water and food producers and sellers , the economy of ali 's country delivers products of a much higher total market value ( read gdp ) than the uk . 
  the fact that there are in fact two distinct markets , one for ali 's country and one for the uk seems to be a minor detail for you . 
  apart from these philosophical considerations and examples at one end or the other of the reality spectrum , congratulations for the map !, 
  it 's very useful .
