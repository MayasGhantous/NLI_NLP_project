  the history part was an answer to your `` when did that start ? 
  who said it did n't ? 
  ( or that i even had `` a way '' when considering a country i feel no special connections to ) edit : and to answer the question , post-truth politics is a concept that can be traced back to the soviet propaganda bureau ( one of the most effective of its kind ) . 
  if you do n't get the joke ( british tabloids warned the populace that 30 million romanians and bulgarians will flood the uk once they remove their work restrictions in 2014 ) , you really should n't bother with facts !, 
  facts are boring in the world of post-truth politics !, 
  especially , when they 're also associated with the e word !, 
  appreciated but the [ stabbing jokes are clustered under a different comment tree ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/573g28/uk_blocking_montenegro_from_opening_eu_chapters/d8onsw3 ) . 
  so i was right in the beginning !, 
  i knew only ( some ) hungarian ( descendants ) are calvinists in transylvania !!, 
  german soul still lost in the far east ? 
   i was born as a calvinist proud hungarian descent intensifies ... , 
  there is also an element of promptness here for the british . 
  the entire uk international trade system defaults to wto rules as soon as they are out of the eu ( or as mrs. may put it : by mid 2019 ) . 
  so it would make sense to apply pressure now and get the most of what you can get with regard to wto terms till then and let time and opportunity heal old wounds after that . 
  `` unity in diversity ^ ^ , kurwa '' !!, 
  i find your lack of `` dork '' disturbing , 
  montenegro is a member of the wto . 
  an organization that the uk aims ( out of necessity ) to re-join as an independent member after brexit . 
  the wto is an organization that moves very slowly and always requires consensus among all its members on the smallest of issues . 
  maybe the uk is having a small diplomatic shakedown with montenegro : `` promise not to oppose our entry/negotiations in the wto and we wo n't delay your accession to the eu as much as we can '' . 
  ( lame ) duck ? 
  did the uk just become a shroedinger member of the eu ( it can be decided if they 're in or out only when you observe how they react to a real issue ) ? 
  hey it 's 2016 ... words cause hurt , you know !, 
  especially on the internet where people always act their best !, 
  what ? 
  you 're being stereotyped after the actions of some ( some might say a few ) of your countrymen ? 
  rough ... that 's like totally uncalled for !, 
  i bet things like that have never happened once in the civilized albion since the turn of the 19th century !, 
  you tagged this one wrong . 
  should have been `` slice of afterlife '' . 
   but brexiters seem to have a hard on for that country could n't have phrased it better myself !, 
  what do the rest 119 % believe ? 
  is that a `` coliba '' ? 
   disgusting leeches just as much as syrians i was n't aware that there was a `` disgusting leech benchmark ''  ) . 
  europe is not mentally challenged as a continent . 
  it 's just that `` unity in diversity '' takes a long time to converge on diverging issues . 
  arguments must be exchanged , local experiments ( i.e. , elections \\ referendums ) made , but reality soon catches up and brutally reinforces the arguments of one side or the other . 
  however , once a view is unanimously accepted , in the eu , it does tend to become effective policy . 
  i do n't really care much about the average brit !, 
  they made their choices and i hope everybody will be happier after things unfold in 2-3 years or so . 
  i was simply pointing out the obvious distinction between accepting ( even reluctantly ) people who have the lawful right to be in your country and opposing ( even with lawful force ) those who do n't . 
  just 52 % of them !, 
  are you brain dead ? 
  eastern europeans have the right by law to travel and work in any eu country as if it were their own !, 
  illegal aliens ( i.e. , economic migrants ) do n't !, 
  the year before , they practiced pre-emptive strikes on a `` simulated ally '' . 
  reports confirm that things went well for them . 
  maybe these pieces of history should be highlighted more !, 
  after all , this is what the eu should be all about in the end : peace and prosperity on the continent !, 
  haters will be haters ... 
  i 'm happy you live in a better place . 
  well of course you can say it , [ but do you really mean it like we do ?

  ^ hope ^ it ^ is n't ^ mexico, 
  more like necro-gay i guess ... people were into some pretty weird shit back in 106 ad . 
  it 's the 21 century - it 's called `` pr '' !, 
   we left `` propaganda '' behind in 1989 . 
  my whole life is a lie !, 
  and you see no further connection with our two `` historical parents '' : decebal and traian ? 
  budapest is awesome !, 
  seriously !, 
  and i have serious doubts that taunusstrasse looks the same as vaci utca or andrassy utca ( was too drunk to remember any other street names ) .

   it does n't matter if he 's a grandpa or a ( newly added ) grandma .

  venezuela can confirm . 
  of course , i nearly forgot how debt is not the imaginary hamster wheel that keeps the entire global economy running ( from sub-saharan africa to china via latin america and austrialia ) !, 
  i 'm by no means defending the hypocrisy of the eu in national debt matters . 
  people who 's opinion on mass migration does not coincide with mutti 's apparently . 
  and i think the latest polls show that they 're slightly more than 50 . 
   ~ ~ this union ~ ~ is simply a piece of debt comedy .

  and `` uneducated low income poor people '' ( a bit of a redundancy right ? ), 
  tend to instill the image that they come from some sort of lost paradise on earth  , right ? 
  there 's plenty of bad places everywhere , but somehow only certain countries get remembered exclusively for the bad while others mostly for the good . 
  for example , when i say frankfurt am main , do you think about the financial heart of europe and the [ shiny skyscrapers ] ( http://city4.xn--e1akkdfpb6a.xn--p1ai/images1/frankfurt-am-main-germany-2.jpg ) or the [ bahnhofsviertel ghetto ] ( http://static1.fnp.de/storage/scl/onlineredaktion/884140_m3w605h320q75v6551_fff_kammerer080813razziarotlicht766.jpg?version=1421101639 ) that lies 100 meters from it ? 
  i guess most people who have n't visited it , will go for the former mental image .
