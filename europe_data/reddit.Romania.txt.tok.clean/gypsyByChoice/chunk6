  is n't it obvious ? 
  you people are not the heroes we deserve but you are the heroes we need !, 
  when the big boys in the eu really decide that they want serbia and montenegro in , they 'll probably bully or buy your neighborly pan-slavic cooperation in the matter . 
  of course it counts !, 
  if you make 3 euros in hr and 2 euros in ro but a liter of slivovitz ( aka . 
  tzuica ) costs 1.5 euros in hr but only 0.5 euros in ro ( for the same  40 % high-quality stuff ) , you are 2 times more likely not to remember how you ended up in a ditch when you live in ro . 
  the quality of ~ ~ an alcoholic 's ~ ~ life is everything my soon to be soberer-than-me balkan friend !, 
   ) edit : i hope serbia does n't join soon ... then we wo n't even be very good at being the poorest . 
  our gdp grew by 5 % yoy in the last quarter . 
  i would get used to becoming the 2nd poorest country in eu if i were you ( but only when considering ppp ) as we seem bent on getting the bronze in the poorlympics . 
  [ very soon ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:hr:ro&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) ...

  i thought that british people are the only ones that did n't need an / s at the end of a statement . 
  it 's not a shitty joke , it 's just shitty sarcasm . 
  so do africans , 
  especially if you 're a foreigner !, 
  i think they had a brexit referendum to prove it !, 
  relatively  ) yes . 
  it is still rich compared to many european countries . 
  it 's only poor when you compare to its former ( unsustainable ) levels of wealth or to other western european countries that have more sustainable socioeconomic models . 
  so can we change the running joke from russian army surplus to romanian army surplus ? 
  slovenia is definitely not in the balkans !, 
  greece neither !, 
  this makes glorious romania the richest country in the balkans  ), 
  we 're too busy making gdp  ), 
  ( s ) he 's a hard lefty ... using the hard working/decency speech has no power over him/her ... you should switch to explaining your point using the prejudice/entitlement/minorities vernacular ... and if you ca n't do it , then i guess you ca n't be right now ? 
  can you ? 
  you bloody etonian !, 
  do n't mention it , mancatz-ash, 
  any thoughts about why people consider it a slur ? 
  i mean , why is calling somebody a gypsy generally a slur but calling him a basque or a catalan or a frisian not ? 
  for me it conjures thoughts about a huge city in italy , 
  yes it is : they are gypsies !, 
  it 's the name they have been known in europe for centuries . 
  they just want to change it as of late ( in every possible language on the continent ) just because it acquired a bad ring to it over the centuries . 
  gypsies can call themselves whatever they like in their own language ( just like the germans refer to themselves as deutsch in their mother tongue ) but they should not be allowed the audacity to dictate what other people call them because of `` political correctness '' . 
  add the / s man , or you 'll get downvoted , a lot !, 
  but , but ... `` fences do n't work ! '', 
  ... was n't this the default mass immigration related remark one year ago or something ? 
  what changed ? 
  why are hungarian fences bad and norwegian ones less so ? 
  underrated comment is underrated  ), 
  dude , do you realize we just graduated from small time terrorist bound `` assault weapons '' trafficking on the ukrainian border to full under-cover `` nuclear-power '' in like one news week ? 
  if this is n't rapid eu/nato-driven development , i do n't know what is !, 
  do n't worry , in 2-3 years you 'll [ catch down ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:hr:ro&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) with us , 
  romania - better than ever . 
  hope it lasts a few quarters and we can capitalize on the mainly consumption driven growth we 're experiencing right now . 
  if not , middle income trap here we come !!, 
  of course , for some, 
  cooking at home / sharing rent or owning their house / getting some extra money by working illegally / hunting for discounts at various retailers ... where there 's a will , there 's a way  ), 
  this depends on the legislation of each country and possibly on international one as well . 
  trial = / = jail . 
  the newspaper could also ( 1 ) pay a hefty fine , ( 2 ) dismiss its shit `` journalist '' in shame , ( 3 ) publish on its front page/site for a week the fact that it has taken deliberate action to misinform its audience by sponsoring and creating false news . 
  i think everybody would feel that justice has been served ( or vindicated depending on their nationalism levels ) . 
  you 're making up stories when you 're trying to impress your mates over a pint at the pub ... when you 're deliberately manipulating a huge audience and denigrating a country at the same time , i think it falls under a different category ( hopefully a penal one ), 
  well it 's easy : we 're a special carpato-danubiano-pontic snowflake that apparently does n't shy away from working as much as others might suspect , 
  why ? 
   have you already checked my lineage ? 
  finally confirmed !, 
  according to this chart we are 100 % not latin !, 
  so , at least now everybody has a graphic representation of bookoharam , 
  fair point , but i would guess data for 2005 is also available ( can be estimated ) for these three countries as well . 
  glad to see romania , bulgaria and croatia are not in the eu again , or maybe by including them , the conclusions of this analysis would not have been so clearly unfavorable to southern eu countries . 
  i 'd give you gold , but i 'm poor and foreign wallets are hard to come by these days ... 
  imho , romania has already fared quite well because before joining the eu it was dirt poor ( 34 % of eu average gdp/capita at ppp ) . 
  now we 're at around 60 % . 
  if we marginally improve on this level , i think most people in the country that knew it 20-30 years ago would be very happy . 
  portugal was n't by any means dirt poor when it joined , nor did it bloom and then doom like greece after joining . 
  it just somehow settled at a level of 75-80 % of the eu average ( gdp/capita at ppp ) . 
  in 2015 , portugal is bellow czechia and slovenia and at the same level with slovakia ( = 77 % ) . 
  at the end , i know the gdp/capita at ppp is a very biased/flawed indicator ( just look at today 's article about the irish economy ) . 
  money is n't everything . 
  for example , on the social progress index , portugal has always , and not without merit , ranked above many western nations . 
  nevertheless , i always had the feeling that portugal did not profit from eu membership as much as other eu countries like : spain , malta , cyprus and the entire eastern eu bloc . 
  thank you for the info !, 
   ) the more you know :d, 
  what is iirc ? 
  i fully agree ... 
  i think the problem is not that you decreased government and then deficit spent , but [ the magnitude of the deficit and its trend ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ggxwdg_ngdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:es&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) ... 
  i might agree with some of those things , even thought they refer to the primary sector mostly - something poor easter eu countries should care more about , not a western country that should be specializing in more advanced stuff than fishing and farming . 
  when talking about sanctions on russia ... it 's easy not to care when you 're at the other end of the continent at a safe distance . 
  i agree well-timed and placed liberalism never hurts but has n't portugal just elected a socialist government ? 
  thank you !, 
  i was not aware that germany should face penalties ( or at least some eu-grade scolding ) as well since they are also breaking the rules . 
  i somehow fail to see the problem then  . 
  from what you 're saying spain is quite rich \\ well-off and because of this it will become a net contributor the the eu . 
  is this a bad thing ? 
  i thought that was the idea of the eu , to help countries develop economically and socially so that in the future those countries could help others in turn . 
  the reply was for somebody from portugal . 
  if spain becomes a net contributor , does n't it mean its economy is above the eu average ? 
  and net contributors still get eu funds ( less than they put in obviously ) but directed towards hi-tech sectors and not infrastructure projects , right ? 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  portugal is unfortunately the prime example of a country that has failed to prosper in the eu ( at least when looking at gdp/capita ) . 
  could you explain why ? 
  the country is truly beautiful and the people are very very nice . 
  maybe some of those industries were uncompetitive ... 
  i know a lot of ours were . 
  but some ( too few in the case of ro sadly ) managed to get by quite well and even prosper . 
  what quotas are hurting portugal most ? 
  hmmm ... maybe the eu , just like every other less developed nation on the continent .
