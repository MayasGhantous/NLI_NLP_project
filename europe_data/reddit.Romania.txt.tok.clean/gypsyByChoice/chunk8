  this was my point . 
   abuse it 's not abuse if you 're not a truly special snowflake . 
  but imho it is a sort of self harming passive aggresive rhetoric that does n't bring anything constructive on the matter and definitely does n't build a much need bridge over the channel . 
  the bulk of the people that voted for brexit do n't hang around on r/europe and i 'm pretty sure that they get their dose of ( alternative ) facts directly from the daily mail , mirror , and the sun . 
  i would prefer if we could simply ignore every small new article that just confirms a trend we predicted , we expect ( and for whatever selfish reason some actually wish for ) and focus on the truly important ones . 
  they uk has made a choice and i think that the real outcome of it will only be truly quantifiable a good 5-10 years from now . 
  after the collapse of the eastern bloc ( of which romania was the poorest member ) , romania and bulgaria chose to move towards the west , serbia chose a path that lead to civil war and the ukraine chose a state of russian-backed limbo . 
  after accession to the eu , romania chose to combat corruption more actively and bulgaria less so . 
  [ the results can be seen here ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:bg:ro:ua:rs&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) , but they were not immediate and they are not irreversible . 
  as far as i know , the uk is still one of the most important nato members and as a romanian this is enough to make me act with some decency towards their decision . 
  mutual self-harm inside the alliance is definitely not going to help . 
  i dread the fact that in the next two years every piece of news like this one will be on a clear path to hot on r/europe because we need to rub it in and show those `` closed-minded and ungrateful british '' that they made a uuuuge mistake ( as if at least 48 % did n't actually realize that relocation / major shifts in some key economic fields is bound to happen ) . 
  this is not how you show that you want to remain friends . 
  historically immigration has been both positive and negative ( for the native populations ) . 
  for example the germans ( and hardly admitted by most romanians , the hungarians too ) had a civilizing effect for romanians in transylvania . 
  vikings ultimately also played a very strong role in the creation of modern russia . 
  as far as i know , arabs also brought numerous improvements ( agriculture , sailing , social organization ) to the iberian peninsula , improvements that were one of the cornerstones of the future spanish and portuguese empires . 
  presently , i 'm concerned about mass uncontrolled immigration of people from a different cultural background that would have big problems integrating in a modern ( and quite liberal ) west and who thus might be ( and apparently are prone to ) finding refuge in extreme ideologies . 
  i 'm not anti-immigration but i would prefer the hollywood principle in the matter . 
  history . 
   i am more worried about the political changes that people want to push as an excuse to fight terrorism or control immigration . 
  me too . 
  that 's why i would enjoy more the italian old school method of combating terrorism than mass surveillance and removing/infringing on other citizen rights i 'm a teacher . 
  thank you for the answer . 
  i will try though to explain why `` flaws in reasoning '' are sort of subjective imho . 
   correlation is not causation [ ... ] maybe he 'll then use romania for his next article true . 
  the last part would n't make sense though as we do n't even have a `` recently established muslim diaspora '' and are not a symbol of the western world and more important of catholicism . 
  italy does have a relevant muslim community that is on par ( size , radicalization potential , countries of origin ) with those of other western countries . 
   if i was a leftist pacifist i just said leftist  . 
  it 's somehow very sad that the two terms are now intertwined . 
  i 'm not by any means an advocate of unnecessary confrontation myself but i 'm not exactly a pacifist either . 
   if you are using a minor offence and entrapment , it 's easy to push up your statistics as `` hundreds '' of terrorist attacks prevented . 
  i think the idea was that no major one occurred even if they act quite harshly on minor offences . 
   he also goes on to overstate italy as a target being one of the only moderately big players not struck by attacks , does it really make no sense that striking it would be a priority ( even only for propaganda reasons ) ? 
   failing to arrest terrorists in transit or actively pushing them to other states is hardly a success of course it is , at least for the people you are responsible for keeping safe and that elect you into power . 
  and ideally you would want to push them back to their place of origin . 
  what nuances is the article completely missing out in your opinion ? 
  i did n't notice any as i thought it simply describes another way of mitigating terror-related incidents . 
  just fishing  speculating that left-wing people would tend to call this article `` propaganda that no european publisher would be interested in but an article that would fare better on the ( heavily more right-wing ) japanese media scene '' . 
  you 're most welcome my leftist friend  ) . 
   romania has a troubled past with terrorism and islamists ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  our traditional ( historical ) islamic community is very very moderate and newcomers that seem likely to cause problems are deported very fast and banned to enter the country for 10 years ( at most , we get a handful of these every year ) . 
  the general perception of islam in romania has of course been ( mis ) shaped a lot in the previous years by incidents from other countries . 
  back in ceausescu 's days we were the main diplomatic intermediary between israel and the palestinians . 
  we even sold weapons and trained troops for both sides  ) . 
  good stuff . 
   i was wondering if people are happy i would a lot of romanians are still more unhappy than they should be when living in a eu country that has made significant improvements on very many fronts since 1989 and , despite political setbacks , has been on the right track for development for quite some time now . 
  we seem to be quite a cynical bunch.we compare ourselves to the west ( hungary and poland included :p ) instead of looking at [ serbia and ukraine ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:bg:hr:hu:ro:ua:rs:me:lv&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) two countries that were above us from a social economic scale starting from the 1970s and all the way through 1992 . 
  sometimes looking behind helps you measure your achievements . 
   dutch , spanish and swedish seem more worried about their own countries having more than half a million people on our streets protesting against corruption in freezing temperatures also has a lot to do with `` worries about the country '' . 
  i guess that on reddit we keep such things to r/romania . 
   people are unhappy and feel they ca n't change their country but might have a voice abroad or give a warning to others i would n't say the two are connected . 
  however , most people in romania still remember the aftermath of the regime change in 1989 . 
  and they remember a destruction of a social fabric with its many bads but also with some ( maybe only individually perceived ) good aspects . 
  this is why whenever we see trends that are about to lead to drastic social changes that appear to weaken the western model we aspire to reach ( i.e. , tolerance towards un-moderate islam , unchecked mass immigration , faulty anti-terrorism measures , left wing parties that move from fighting for the economic rights of the working/middle class towards focusing on gender and minorities issues ) we tend to take the conservative stance and finally appear to act like : `` look , even romania does this better than you ! '' . 
   see romanian bears hopefully from a safe distance  . 
  they tend to be less friendly than yogi and boo-boo up close . 
  do n't need to be that sarcastic  . 
  i was just pointing out that our italians cousins might be on to something when it comes to effectively combating modern terrorism . 
  spain has n't been that bad either after the madrid attacks . 
  i would not presume to tell other countries how they should run and romania is definitely not a positive example in very many ways . 
  however , when it comes to dealing with terrorism ( imported or home grown ) , we 're pretty decent given our limited financial and administrative resources . 
  it sometimes makes sense to learn even from those that you deem far beneath you . 
  hubris is rarely a quality in man and governments alike . 
  and you should definitely visit here and make some photos of your own . 
  no , i just like bright colors on the flag . 
  why do you ask ? 
  of course not !, 
  you get deported asap ( a few weeks at most ) if you have any links to jihadists and our internal information service ( sri ) seems quite competent in spotting potential threats early on ( we somehow seem to have a model pretty similar to the italian one ) . 
  secondly , we are not a major target when comparing to other places in europe . 
  it 's almost as if they want her to get reelected . 
  you should print and fax this article to every government in europe !, 
  i think they are in a way . 
  it 's just `` evolved communism '' with a trace of traditional imperial administration style . 
  seems incredibly effective at controlling and gradually developing large masses of uneducated people . 
  do n't know but i generally do n't associate communism with the right ... 
   economically to the right , socially to the left . 
  and people say china ca n't be a good role model for modern countries . 
  have you heard about best korea ? 
   gassing the place for several hours the country , the context , the recommendation , i must say it made me chuckle a little . 
  stephen colbert ? 
  i read an article that said that because romania does n't have a `` country premium '' in the wine industry ( i.e. , people would n't brag about buying ro wine as they do with french or italian ones ) , local producers make more by focusing on the internal market than trying to export at a `` competitive price '' all over the continent . 
  we do export but just to some places ( e.g. , you could find recas wines at tesco but this is about to change because of brexit and the expected increase in tariffs ) . 
  i agree with you but `` all gypsies smell bad to me '' is very different to `` all gypsies smell bad ! '', 
  and the latter is what i called sort of racist . 
  exactly . 
  we 're responsible for all the dots in that graph . 
   some of safest countries in one of the safest times this might be true but it is not perceived as such , no matter how many statistics you show to people . 
  fatal accidents are just that , horrible misfortunes - tragedies of the worst kind . 
  violent crimes tend to be reduced by better economic conditions and increased education levels . 
  and we , as a society , are working hard to improve both on accidents and on the need and use of unwarranted violence . 
  terrorism is a different beast as it is directed , planned and executed by someone with an agenda . 
  someone who has a support base , i.e. 
  fans near and far away . 
  someone who has sponsors . 
  someone that apparently tends to be your neighbor in today 's world . 
  and this keeps people on the edge far more than the chance of having a horrible accident or of being the victim of a fatal crime . 
  and sadly enough for one major religion and a lot of people in need of help in/from the middle east , in the past years , all these lunatics have one ostensible thing in common . 
  yes i do .
