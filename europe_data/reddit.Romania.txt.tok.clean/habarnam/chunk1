as far as i remember there was a stamp and a signature on the one i filled . 
  i could be wrong though , i was in a bit of a hurry . 
  also a lot of commotion related to an additional declaration that people voting outside of their circumscription need to sign before being allowed to vote . 
  in some of the voting sections in the capital , these papers ( that need to be official for some reason ) have been depleted and nothing seems to be done about it . 
  i had to try in 4 different election offices before finding one where i could vote . 
  i do n't even realize if it 's incompetence or plain fraud . 
  are you trying to be ironic ? 
  bwahahah , i think the brits would be twice as upset if they 'd know that romanians instead of taking their jobs are taking their unemployment benefits . 
  get a bloody job , you bum !, 
  there are two million five hundred thousand bicycles in berlin . 
  that 's [ a fact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cycling_in_berlin ) . 
  about 4.5 km to the bucharest 's km 0 . , 
  let 's not forget that meego can run anything that can be ported to an arm linux kernel . 
  this is one of the main reasons that ( in my opinion ) make plain linux mobile oses better than the competition . 
  hmmm , let 's agree to disagree then . 
   [ edit ] it 's amazing to me that the statement i commented on is on + karma without providing _ any _ support or explanation , and i 'm getting downvoted without the courtesy of a comment . 
   so : meego rulz , retardroid sux !, 
  ! 1one peace out !, 
  nokia already had a very good smart phone os available and developed inhouse : meego . 
   but where nokia never caught up is in software . 
  actually meego os was ( is ) one of the best phone oses to date . 
  the fact that they failed to promote it , fired most of the people working on it , and went the windows mobile way is one of the main reasons they failed into irrelevance . 
  maybe it was too little too late , but i think it would have turned things around for them . 
  ( see how hyped sailfish os and jolla are ), 
  the two do n't exclude each other . 
  too bad they 're still shit : there are separator pylons between the two bike lanes , which are a serious hazard , the divider between the actual road and the bike lane is almost 30cm in height ( twice as high as the regular curb ) and presents a danger to cyclists and to motorists . 
  not to mention that it 's not yet finished and as such there are no bicycle traffic lights ( i 've seen at least 10 cyclists disregard intersections and pedestrian crossings because of this , one almost getting clipped by a trolley ) . 
  the surface is uneven even with sewer man holes raised here and there . 
  all in all , this particular bike lane is a fucking joke and i , as a cyclist will change my route to avoid it . 
  be careful , he marked you to steal your wallet . 
  to be honest , i 'm not 100 % sure what i 'm reading from the site ... 
  i just translated what 's there . 
  there are three groups and maybe i conflated them poorly , vat and profit tax are under goods and services , for example . 
  in this case i 'm not sure how to read the graph , sorry . 
  about 45 % , of which [ 1 ] : * 20 % social security * 16 % profit tax * 24 % vat * 16 % income tax * 13 % health insurance ( split in two funds as far as i 've seen ) * other minor stuff ... [ 1 ] data taken from [ open budget ] ( http://openbudget.ro/ ), 
  last time i checked their line-up , there really were n't any big names i really wanted to see that i have n't seen before . 
  the only things that might interest me are the world music and irish & blues stages . 
  i have n't decided if that 's enough . 
  on the other hand , like all the big festivals it 's the perfect hippie commune : drugs , booze , sex , loudness are all around you and might overwhelm you sometimes . 
  hmm ... now that i think about it , it might be a good idea to go ... 
  well , there was also ( the sc2 final happens as i write this ) the [ dreamhack bucharest ] ( http://dreamhack.ro ) lan party . 
  i 'm under the impression that the parent poster was n't exactly thinking about nato when he said `` us '' . 
  i agree ... 
  well , you still have `` snailing '' ... that 'd be pretty awkward in english . 
  i think it 's weird that when you say war with russia , in your mind you see `` usa vs. russia '' . 
  i think it speaks a bit about the hypocrisy of some europeans that complain about us interventionist policies , but when things are getting difficult that 's where they see the solution coming from . 
  reddit is based on open-source software , clone the repository and build your own . 
  well , god damn , that seems almost reasonable . 
  holy shit !, 
  i never knew this . 
  the romanian cinema seems to be built just on the harsh descriptions of our country . 
  so take any of the last cannes showings and they 'll be pretty good but in my opinion , another good one is [ filantropica ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314067/ ) . 
  well , it seemed fun . 
  i guess you guys did n't think so ... 
  shit man , you brought back some good memories . 
  i 've been there about 20 years ago with my family and it was pretty kick ass . 
  hazelnuts on the sides of the trail , `` slanina '' at the camp fire , sleeping in an old school canvas tent , endless nagging from my folks to keep an eye out for horned vipers . . heheheh , good times . 
  seeing that romania is a little bit under represented , i submit [ environments ] ( http://youtu.be/znlppfqna0e ) . 
  they 're not really indie-rock , but a minimalist dark ambient rather suited for solitary introspection than for playing in a club . 
  but maybe you guys will like it . 
  probably yes . 
  i would imagine there 's no point otherwise . 
  [ mine with spoilers ] ( http://url.geoguessr.com/5mur ) : 30445 . 
  so guys , ummm , last one out the door turns off the light !, 
   the protests were agains the whole political class , practically against both the prime minister and the president ... do you have a source for that ? 
  i did n't hear anything about the president so far . 
  maybe i 'm subscribed to the wrong blogs . 
  it 's not a protest against government , afaik it 's a protest against the prime minister and a bunch of laws that would essentially let free all the corrupt politicians condemned in the last couple of years . 
  i did n't mean it as i `` have faith '' that my mep will do the thing i consider correct , but i meant it as `` voted for this mep , because her views are compatible to mine and i trust her to make an informed decision '' . 
  ( dunno if this makes me less na\u00efve in your eyes , but for me it 's enough ), 
  to be honest , i trust my mep to do the right thing . 
  fair enough . 
   the 4 year old kid who died was killed by dogs released by one of these ngo 's . 
  citation needed . 
  good resource . 
  thank you . 
  that 's not exactly a `` science journal '' . 
  [ edit ] i stand corrected ... 
  i was basing my statement on their unavailable web-site . 
  i think / u/meidei is right , you just reinvented [ eures ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/eures/ ) . 
  again this with the `` real '' ? 
  wtf man ? 
  here 's some other ones , a bit more gloomy in tone : * [ nascuti la comanda - decreteii ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1189042/ ) - a film about [ romania 's `` baby boom '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decretei ) from the sixties , after our late dictator decided our population should reach 20 million . 
  * [ gigi , monica and bianca ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134672/ ) - a film about a couple of homeless teenagers that have a baby daughter and how they survive on the streets of bucharest . 
  they 're from the line-up of the [ astra film festival ] ( http://www.astrafilm.ro/news.aspx ) where generally one can see really good documentaries . 
  [ edit ] adding a bit more context . 
  it 's a british infographic on a spanish blog . 
   the tractor and trailer that picks up the trash every thursday really does throw everything in a big pile . 
  that 's because at the recycling plant they do another triage . 
  people ca n't be really trusted to split them correctly . 
  :d let me guess , the village is somewhere in the west part of romania ? 
  we 're really behind in regards to the infrastructure needed for recycling . 
  just in the capital and few of the big cities there are bins for plastic-metal , paper and glass collecting . 
  and generally , the people disregard them because `` they always gather the contents with the same car '' ... another point is that there are no campaigns for bringing this issue into public attention . 
  god damn ` it ... you stole my line ... 
  good encryption is done between the ends of the communication using pairs of public/private encryption keys . 
  so , theoretically you do n't need the support of your service providers , but the one of your interlocutor . 
  most of the open-source im clients have support for the otr encryption plugin - which encrypts the conversations on top of the communication protocol . 
  so the problem is now , how to convince my 100 luddite friends on the benefits of encryption and maintaining a web of trust . 
   who looks quite normal bwahahahah , are n't you a closet racist .
