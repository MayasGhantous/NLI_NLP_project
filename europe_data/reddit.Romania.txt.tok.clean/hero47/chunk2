  i know man , i know . 
  ^ tears ^ of ^ joy, 
  i think it 's fair to say that this rich prick wo n't be splitting the atom any time soon . 
  nice things cost money . 
  where 's the money , tzipraski ? 
  i fucking hate those dedeman guys checking the receipts . 
  i exit the shop usually carrying a lot of items , and those assholes force me to get my wallet out . 
  i have only so many hands , you know ... 
  this happens every.fucking.time . 
  this is my main gripe with them . 
  we spared ** no ** expense . 
  hey man , hungarians are our bros. 
  if anything , we shall unite forces and face the night creatures together !, 
  for the night is dark and full of terrors . 
  well done , croatia !, 
  romania just seized a few billion euros from a lukoil . 
  we can split it with you . 
  gib schengen pls . 
  no bribe , 100 % gift , totally legit . 
  sorry this happened to you , man . 
  i myself caused a minor accident two years ago but i accepted the fault & consequences , felt really bad for not being more careful . 
  so we 're not all assholes ... as a sidenote , i 've been putting off that dashcam purchase for some time now . 
  guess now 's the time to get one ... 
  what about rome then ? 
  make sure you do n't miss out on the [ transfagarasan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transf%c4%83g%c4%83r%c4%83%c8%99an ) . 
  went there yesterday , pretty awesome road and scenery . 
  because we still have a large proportion of rural inhabitants . 
  they generally have a quite low standard of living , which does n't include computers and internet connectivity . 
  that being said , those living in cities can enjoy 15eur/month gigabit connections . 
  a barge it is , yes . 
  the long con . 
  sixty thousand of these vacations and greece 's debt is taken care of . 
  i 'm afraid my initial response was overly dramatic . 
  surely there are plenty of competent , honest and hard-working people in the healthcare system . 
  we only have to get rid of the rotten apples , not the whole box . 
  burn these motherfuckers to the ground . 
  the healthcare system in romania is rotten to the core . 
  can we into schengen now , netherlands ? 
  we can rebuild him . 
  that is quite old data . 
  hope we fare better in recent statistics . 
  romania ca n't even, 
  a shitty name . 
  romania can not even into transport , pls send help :'(, 
  `` expected '', 
  time for anschluss . 
  we 'll get there ... in about 60 years :'(, 
  i give you good price . 
  jimmies will be rustled . 
  new rules this time , to avoid the previous fuck-up . 
  maximum 100 winners . 
   the median income is very low median salary is still higher in greece than in poland . 
  iraklis should have stopped smoking . 
  am romanian , can confirm turd smells like flowers and spring now . 
  [ the banks will open on tuesday ... they will , they will .

  tres commas , richard !, 
  same in south-west romania . 
  usually it 's hot as hell ( 35-40c ) , this time of year . 
  bliss right now at 24c . 
  could get used to this weather . 
  top kek m8, 
  not since the accident . 
  now must make moneys for a model s :(, 
  fuck them . 
  live long and prosper , dna !, 
   young driver was celebrating his 29th birthday by driving 200 km/h through a village . 
  what a dipshit . 
  glad no one else got hurt/killed . 
  ask yourself : what gun would jesus own ? 
  he said himself back in march that he 'll resign if this situation ever arises . 
  he 's a spineless , worthless piece of crap . 
  the dacia sandero ... 
  i really hope this continues in following years . 
  fingers crossed . 
  why did the chicken cross the border ? 
  those . 
  well now they know . 
  i 'm thinking getting tortured in your home country is no better . 
  a very constructive remark on your part . 
  do you even ? 
  they should convert this building to hosting museums . 
  serving the parliament does it no justice . 
  they are not worthy of its grandiosity . 
  glad to hear it . 
  she deserves recognition for her dedication and hard work . 
  psst . 
  can romania into schengen ? 
  what a club to be in ... 
  you apple guys with your symbols . 
  indeed . 
  yesterday was not a good day :(, 
  it 's okay . 
  you only need ` bout 3,50 $ . 
  my city ( craiova , romania ) started using this technique four or five years ago and i must say that it has payed off , no potholes seem to form around the new manholes anymore . 
  now if only they 'd go about and fix all of them old ones , that 'd be great . 
  double fucking standards .
