i really hope you are right for the sake of what is left of russia 's normality . 
  you have to be fucking kidding me ... not only is this completely retarded , but the monument was n't even dedicated to tim cook ... what can i say ? 
  russia leaves me speechless somethimes . 
  we do n't fuck around when it comes to sports and supporting your team . 
  imagine a billboard featuring adolf hitler in germany . 
  it really is amazingly sad such thing happen in russia . 
  freedom land ? 
  ( though the two party system messes with it pretty hard ), 
  slovenia is like a miniature austria but better . 
  loved every second while a i was there . 
  probably the best country in the eu . 
  10/10 , would steal jobs there . 
  probably an immigrant who did n't get the memo yet . 
  pray to every god you have it wo n't become like our now defunct [ otv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otv_%28romanian_tv_station%29 ) . 
  we also had some major protests and marches here in romania againt a mining project ( `` save rosia montan\u0103 '' ) . 
  there were around 30k-50k people at the largest one . 
  so far they have worked though the danger of the government trying again still looms . 
  still , it has been probably the first time since the revolution when protests hava actual changed something . 
  only malnourish . 
  did the russians make anything original and popular then ? 
  borscht is from ukraine . 
  vodka would be better . 
  it 's google earth , not maps . 
  you can see it yourself if you download it and use the timeline feature . 
  some context would be nice . 
  they have a russian army unit stationed in transnistria . 
  they also do n't want to let go of their influence there ( which is pretty big ) . 
  all i can say to this : putin huylo !, 
  europe fucking something up in the uk as always ... 
  `` funny '' thing is that there is actually a rumor going around that our pm once threw a guy of a balcony who was investigating a thing about him . 
  a documentary should be released soon about it . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cristian_panait ) is the wiki page of the guy who he supposedly killed . 
  i wanted to describe our pm in this thread but then i realized i would probably get banned because of the amount of swear i would use without realizing . 
  i have never hated a politician so much like him . 
  he pretty much has all the traits i can hate in a politician . 
  there is even a conspiracy going around that he once threw a guy of a balcony because he was investigating a thing related to him . 
  there is a documentary scheduled to appear soon about it . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cristian_panait ) is the wiki page of the guy who he supposedly killed . 
  great idea . 
  might apply for a government job so at least i get payed . 
  even stranger is racism against blacks coming from us . 
  by this i mean i have never seen a romanian have any problem with a black person or saying anything bad about black culture . 
  in fact , most young romanian admire black people because of all the american movies they see on tv or the internet . 
  besides , we have very low immigration so there is no racism coming from that either . 
  as one of our stand-up comedians put it : nobody comes to us looking for a better life . 
   probably only south korea has better and faster broadband infrastructure . 
  bitch please . 
  that aside , how is the vote for the gay rights act going ? 
  you get antena 3 ? 
  poor guys ... 
  but then latvia would want potato . 
  this are parliamentary elections . 
  your vote does not waste away because it means more seats in parliament for that party even if the do n't win a majority . 
  i hope the trend continues . 
  we could be going places ( like england :p ) if this keeps on going . 
  seems like we are getting the best of both worlds . 
  it 's about civil rights , not ordering you about . 
  it 's like saying we should not criticise north korea as long as they keep their shit in their own country . 
  \\ #shotsfired \\ #missileslaunched, 
  prison time is a bit too much a think . 
  however , a hefty fine should do the job . 
  went to vama veche this summer for the first time on my own . 
  as a kid i went to my parents who have a special connection to the place . 
  my father likes to brag he is the first person to sleep in a tent there ( in the spring right after the revolution ) . 
  it really is heaven on earth . 
  the people are friendliest i 've ever met and it really is a no-bullshit `` resort '' . 
  what surprised me the most though was the high amount of foreigners . 
  our wonderful hosts at the hotel told us there is a couple who lives in denmark but are both born in iran . 
  also , i heard what i assume were young turks making fun of our shawarma :d, 
  valcea is surrounded by car dealerships because of how many boys would use their scammed/hacked money to buy cars . 
  i mean it 's just a poorer romania speaking with a different accent . 
  the problem is that once they come back they have a serious obsession with removing kebab . 
  well ... you are protecting a union you are part of . 
  still can not into space . 
  what was the result ? 
  what out of his comment seems far-fatched ? 
  joinging the ukr army ? 
  many foreigners of ukr descent join the struggle . 
  would ' t seems so strange if your homeland is being invaded . 
  i doubt you can join the ukrainian regular army . 
  however , if you contact almost any volunteer battalion they will probably accept you . 
  we used to call pig feet ` adida\u0219i ' ( adidash ) before the revolution . 
  not sure if it had to do anything with the shoes . 
  til there is a language which has a word for a place where you fart . 
  til i know a few russian words . 
  it will be srange seeing the favourite pistol of the nazis used by kurds to kill islamic jihadists . 
  i think ukraine did a pretty good job during the revolution to move it eastward . 
  not here . 
  and it 's a very small problem , especially compared to our other problems . 
  ironically , they have the highest amount of neo-nazis . 
  i had no idea the romani flag existed on / r/europe . 
  nice addition !, 
  ^ ^  inb4 ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ the ^ ^ same ^ ^ as ^ ^ the ^ ^ romanian ^ ^ one, 
  how many wallets did you get ? 
  my record is 14 . 
  this has to be the funniest and ironic thing i 've seen all week . 
  i hope we do n't have to pull another 1919 soon . 
  that was fucking amazing . 
  10/10 , would visit . 
  someone in this thread said statues are erected to honour someone .
