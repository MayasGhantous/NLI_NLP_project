ha , hellas . 
  that 's what we call [ these ] ( http://www.lemondressing.gr/english/media/products/8.jpg ) . 
  not to mention the philippines , there 's a huge community of filipinos in romania : https://www.facebook.com/pages/the-filipino-community-in-romania/129753840391705, 
  well the taxis are cheap but not that cheap . 
  it 's 0.3 eur per kilometer ( and 0.3 for the fare start ) . 
  5km would cost you 1.8 eur + tip . 
  we 'll make sure to wait for the ukrainian one to be over before we protest again , sorry !, 
  they 're called [ mititei ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mici&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=zjwpuq_roybeswapnih4dg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=954#es_sm=93&amp;espv=210&amp;q=mititei&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch ) or [ mici ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mici&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=zjwpuq_roybeswapnih4dg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=954 ) . 
  only correcting you in case you ever need to look for a recipe , 
   it 's getting a lot better as time passes i really have to disagree , seeing who the mayor of the city ( still ) is . 
  dude , your stray dogs ( at least the ones i saw in varna ) look like heavyweight lifters !, 
  i swear , they all looked like they 're going to the gym or something . 
  i do n't know what they feed them in varna but their muscles looked pretty much [ like these muscles ] ( https://vitaminsforpitbulls.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/how_to_build_muscle_in_dogs.jpg ) . 
  our stray dogs are not that fierce looking , i 'm telling you . 
  [ sunday evening was the most lively though ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mt2oxys3zu ), 
  you might be right but that 's really not relevant to this discussion . 
  oh crap , i should stop reading between the lines . 
  / u/labyrinthos , sorry for misunderstanding you . 
   romanians know these tricks all to well . 
  ** gypsies ** know these tricks all too well . 
  ftfy . 
  i used to work in dansk supermarked a couple of years ago but it was just a warehouse ( series of warehouses ? ), 
  which distributed stuff to the big guys : bilka , netto , f\u00f8tex , etc. 
  should i take it they banned any of the warehouse workers from wearing anything on their heads or are those large chains part of dansk supermarked and any of their workers ( cashiers , etc. ), 
  prohibited from wearing hats ? 
  latvia wants the e, 
  i think there 's a difference in the way this is enforced . 
  i feel like it 's one of those laws which can be easily ignored even by the authorities and quite frankly , you 're the first person i hear about who actually got fined because of that . 
  i know it 's been a long time but do you remember how much the fine was ? 
  it 's also worth mentioning that many romanians moving to another city who rent a place do n't go to the municipality to declare it . 
  meanwhile , in denmark , you risk a huge fine for not declaring your change of address . 
  therefore , it might also have something to do with the source of the percentages . 
  that should be at most half , if not less , than what it costs in norway . 
  that 's like your opinion , man . 
  have no fear , we are keeping a close eye on crocodile92 . 
  that 's production , not distribution . 
  and you call yourself romanian . 
  i 'd be ashamed with that download speed . 
  then again , your country is an island . 
  comparing an individual set of data to an average is bound to give such differences . 
  that 's why it 's called `` average ''  this christmas has been pretty much the same in southern romania as last year - above 15 celsius and very sunny . 
  then who are the dutch ? 
  wow . 
  you should go there and see the people who are protesting . 
  you 'd be surprised how wrong you are . 
  he was referring to me , who as a mod of / r/romania , decided against allowing the image to be posted . 
  just to clarify a bit - it was n't an explosion but indoor pyrotechnical effects gone wrong . 
  witnesses say the walls and ceiling caught fire and it all burned , but there was no blast . 
  free entry as well . 
  that 's the first time i hear about that - what are you referring to ? 
  a period in particular or . . ? 
  i 'm not even gon na bother to argument against your assumptions about your list of `` known facts about all immigrants '' . 
  do you seriously want to take the conversation there ? 
  do we have to discuss extremism in every thread there is ? 
  every country has idiots like the one in the link you shared . 
  i live in bucharest ( outskirts , might i add ) and i see blacks , asians , indians and arabs every day . 
  and would n't you know it ... they 're all alive after all these years of living here . 
  this guy speaks bollocks . 
  you actually have to know what color his white horse was . 
  i read a linguist 's theory once that the romanian da actually comes from latin . 
  do n't know how reliable it is , but you can read it yourself : http://www.romaniaminor.net/ianua/ianua08/05.pdf, 
  it 's actually both in spanish and portuguese , but mostly from south america . 
  true , but he 's a retard and says one thing in the morning and another thing in the evening . 
   democrazy typo or meant to ? 
  if this would suffice , i 'd brag , but this is a small victory which does n't guarantee this wo n't happen again . 
  this is just the beginning for us , ai n't nobody going home just yet . 
  we can always go protest at the parliament rather than at the government . 
  according to the people in power it is . 
  this is n't an official source and nothing has been declared officially . 
  the website that announced this originally ( dcnews.ro ) is a. . . well , let 's call it alternative news website owned by intact group , that also owns antena 3 , one of the most propagandistic television stations in romania , who is supporting the government . 
  at this point , it 's just a piece of rumour thrown out there to discourage romanians from protesting again this weekend and should be disregarded . 
  i would like to request a `` not confirmed '' flair or something similar . 
  shit me too . 
  how many are we from the same high school ? 
  i graduated in 08 and him in 07 . 
  depends on what you had to eat . 
  [ they 're genuine + financed by the norwegian embassy in romania ] ( http://awaytonorway.ro/ ) and you 're an ass . 
  [ some romanians are doing it by bike , for a documentary . 
  ] ( http://www.kisskissbankbank.com/en/projects/away-to-norway ), 
  that 's rather harsh , do n't you think so ? 
  it 's actually not in russian but in [ udmurt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmurt_language ) so it 's no wonder the person you replied to could n't understand what they were saying . 
  i do n't find the song an insult and they have my vote . 
  it 's not like they have n't tried to qualify for eurovision before and it 's not like they were taken from the village and sent to baku . 
  they actually have some recorded songs prior to all of this . 
  which city is this in ? 
  it 's good to hear that the manifestation is n't something on a large scale but since you brought it up , i do feel that aarhus is at times * too * tolerant to certain groups of individuals - and yes , i ** am ** talking about the youngsters in gellerup that frequently cause havoc and destruction wherever they go through the city . 
  i had the ( bad ) luck to live in skjoldhoejkollegiet for 3 years and the only ones causing trouble were the `` gellerup brigade '' that would occasionally come to the kollegiet and thrash the place up . 
  people would call the police but would often not show up just because we happened to mention the physical description of the perpetrators . 
  the manifestation the article talks about is definitely ** not ** a solution but something has to be done about the ghetto area . 
  people are afraid to walk at night near gudrunsvej/city vest and the bus gets stones thrown at them by groups of youngsters . 
  and i hate to say it but the ethnicity of the youngsters doing harm is more than known throughout the city of aarhus . 
  i would hate to see a gellerup vs. the rest of the city going down in aarhus . 
  is there any information about this , anywhere ? 
  i have n't heard a single thing - because i do n't roam in those circles , perhaps . 
  i believe it has something to do with being associated to the slavic nations , thus situating romania clearly in the `` eastern europe '' . 
  it 's silly , i know , but look at how proud we are at the origin of the language and how different it is from the languages surrounding romania . 
  i , for one , do n't agree with the romanians being situated in the balkans because i feel that the typical balkanic music is not part of our national identity . 
  actually , the other countries do n't need to follow poland 's decision as having only poland veto against the law in the parliament is * enough * for not allowing acta to be implemented . 
  it would be awesome though if they were n't alone .
