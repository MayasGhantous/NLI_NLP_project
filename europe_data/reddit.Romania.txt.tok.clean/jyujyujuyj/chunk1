why are you bombing kurds fighting isis turkey ? 
  and why do you secretly somewhat support isis ? 
  sure you do n't want a kurdish state on your border , but maybe , just maybe they deserve their own state somewhere in the world too ? 
  how about an entire street of proof ? 
  would you take that ? 
  temporary , short-term concentration camps . 
  yes . 
  if you insist on calling them that to belittle my suggestion . 
  you are already spending a good amount of money cleaning up after them , giving to them as well as losing as a result of a decrease in tourism . 
  it would n't be jail , and it would be just for a few days . 
  so that the total amount of days spent begging , let 's call that tb is considerably less than the total amount of days necessary to turn a profit , called tp . 
  while there , some education could be provided , during those couple of days . 
  swedish language , some basic working skills such as tiling or wood-working , etc. 
  as well as a place to clean up , dress up and look for a job . 
  edit : you have a tremendous housing problem in stockholm and sweden in general , so , take these people off the streets and try to add them to the construction sector workforce . 
  let them build their own little houses . 
  sweden is certainly a large country and finding suitable land is n't a problem . 
  why not teach the home-less to be home-builders :d, 
  if swedes would n't give money , this would n't be a problem , now fucking would it ? 
  stop giving money . 
  make it against the law to beg so you can forcefully put these people , not behind bars , but in a separate , closed shelter , temporarily . 
  for example , if you are caught begging you need to stay 20 days inside a closed facility . 
  if it 's not profitable for them , they will stop doing it . 
  right ? 
  it does n't need to be racist in any way as the same rules can apply to swedes too . 
  we could open up the job market a little for vietnamese workers as well . 
  on account of having him as president , could we become a federal state of germany ? 
  we 'll trade you anti-corruption prosecutors for some industry . 
  ah , yes . 
  could you send them back please ? 
  what does the other word mean ? 
  for the red bars . 
  edit : repatriates / immigrants ? 
  could be 1000 characters or more ... 
  the idea is that everyone can propose a small part of a larger solution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_exports_of_russia just look at that and imagine what happens to russia when solar power comes into its own . 
  it will either go to war against someone or fall apart , or both .

  they will likely blame the west for what is happening to them and we 'll have a serious problem on our hands . 
  they 're dutch . 
  cranes on water is nothing out of the ordinary with them . 
  seriously , what good could all that screaming possibly do ? ... 
  i think i can hear her from the op video ... 
  wait , you are dutch and you do n't know what the `` floating thinggy '' is called ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  cranes are serious shit . 
  especially on water . 
  there 's not going to be any catastrophic collapse . 
  too late for what ? 
  being nationalistic ? 
  i do n't want to be nationalistic ; i only want to live in a free , secular society . 
  yes , all economies are a ponzi scheme because they all started at a time when birthrates were what they were . 
  a country needs to increase its ' population until automation can provide more services than workforce is needed . 
  currently , people are still more capable or cheaper than robots in many industries . 
  so you need immigrants . 
  yes , house prices are inflated , but the local population gains more value and the immigrants who have very little , work and pay for the added value . 
  or , they bring the value with them , which is nothing but an investment . 
  you assume rich people prefer cheap workers over automation to make money ; they actually do n't care . 
  you 're always free to emigrate to japan to experience that life . 
  if they will have you . 
  i 'm perfectly fine with that idea and be honest with yourself there are only two ways to do it . 
  raise birthrates . 
  ( but europeans are resisting that ) 2 . 
  immigration ( which i favor because i do n't want to father and raise 4 children , it 's too much ; i 'd rather buy some expensive cars , have some nice holidays etc. ), 
  the problem is getting the right immigrants , not just ** any ** immigrants who themselves are unskilled and go on welfare . 
  if you think you want to raise and properly educate 4 children , that 's your business . 
  i also do n't really have a problem with `` destroying national identity '' . 
  it 's not as if the culture just disappears but rather is maintained by people who want to maintain it . 
  it bothers me that everyone thinks hungarians hate romanians and romanians hate hungarians . 
  indeed if both countries brought a bunch of immigrants from somewhere , there would be less hate and romanians can continue to be romanians and hungarians , hungarians . 
  the problem is not that immigrants do n't adopt the local culture , but that they are resisting hard-earned western values ( gender equality , freedom of speech , etc ) . 
  the eu is based on such values , so if the immigrants are against them , then why would they care about a federal eu anyway . 
  so , neither goal is served . 
  not the economic one , not the political one . 
  there are fewer and fewer unskilled jobs to be found though . 
  2nd and 3rd generation immigrants ( from certain cultures ) are considerably more hateful of their country than first generation . 
  i started building a website and bought fiximmigrationnow.eu the idea would be to allow users to submit `` tweet '' - style posts with potential solutions and receive upvotes from other users . 
  then have the app automatically tweet / facebook post / email , a link to the webpage to eu / national politicians every time a milestone is reached , such as 500 000 registered users , 1 mil registered users , etc. 
  and 10 000 , 50 000 , 100 000 votes for proposal x and so on . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  should i continue developing it ? 
  i am a little busy these weeks though . 
  the website would ** absolutely not be against all immigration ** but would be for fixing the immigration process and legislation . 
  no more illegals , but considerable easier entry for immigrants who would integrate well and who are needed for specific industries . 
  ** me personally would like to increase immigration , not decrease it ** ( especially to transylvania , where i currently live ) but i do n't want more immigrants who hate us and our way of life . 
  so , maybe re-orienting towards east asian countries ? 
  latin america ? 
  downvote because i 'm sick and tired of these posts and seeing gypsies or roma written on romania on every single one . 
  it 's enough already . 
  i see , so if gypsies do that it 's called extortion and it 's the police who should take care of them . 
  bring it up with them , in your country , not with me on reddit . 
  alright . 
  thank you . 
  as much as hating on greece is fun , the banks that gave so much money are also responsible . 
  if you have a drug-addict friend do you keep giving him more and more money ? 
  how confident can you be that you 'll ever see that money back ? 
  so , give me a break . 
  what gypsies ? 
  no , it 's quite impossible .
