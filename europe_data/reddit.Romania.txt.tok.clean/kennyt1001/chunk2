  and i 'm surprised that they do n't really do so in other countries . 
  our president appears on a tv station 's talk show regularly , the prime-minister too , the other party leaders , the senate 's and parliament 's leaders . 
  most of the time 's it 's to talk about stuff that 's currently happening in the country , sometime 's it 's to talk about future plans and sometimes it 's to try and whitewash themselves after something nasty appears in the press . 
  what happened to my country with the gypsies ? 
  you think it 's because of them we have problems ? 
  god you 're a stupid individual . 
  it 's definitely the gypsies and not the fact that romania was under a dictatorship until 25 years ago . 
  is n't it the same thing with the bible though ? 
  what you gon na do about it ? 
  not let people believe in the stupid shit they believe in ? 
  so ... what ? 
   these people are completely delusional , so are the die-hard christians . 
  and they have the right to , what was it , ` self-determination ' . 
  to believe whatever the fuck they want . 
  do you know who had permanent bases in a country ? 
  in ukraine . 
  in crimea to be more specific . 
   the ukrainian people which half ? 
  you think pluto is a joke ? 
  pluto is not happy . 
  shhhh . 
  it 's ok to be wrong , every now and then . 
  it 's politicians have definitely decided to do something that pissed russia off . 
  if they did n't even consider that they might put their country in trouble because of it , they were being irresponsible , to say the least . 
  no , you make bad decisions , you face the consequences for ** your ** decisions . 
  i 'm not conceding the fact that ukraine ca n't demand anything . 
  they can only beg . 
  and beg they will . 
  nor the fact that people still voted for the politicians they deserve . 
  sure . 
  that 's why no one gave a single fuck . 
  that 's what the losers always claim . 
  same in romania . 
  they claim each election had massive numbers of fraudulent votes , yet they ca n't prove it . 
  even when the justice system is independent . 
  just right now , a week ago , a party that 's in the opposition claimed that it is sure that the next presidential elections will be hijacked later this year without providing an ounce of proof or fact . 
  they did n't cause more people voted for politicians who wanted to be closer to russia then europe . 
  they 've had more than 20 years to ** slowly ** distance themselves from russia . 
  they did n't cause cheap gas . 
  i do n't think ukraine is really in a position to demand anything . 
  beg maybe , demand , no way . 
  why would i want to hurt you ? 
  what gas ? 
  what oil ? 
  romania 's gas and oil is coming from romania . 
  also , china 's been signing agreements with everyone . 
  at least in europe and africa . 
  for all kinds of projects and investments , and trade . 
  do you have interests in ukraine ? 
  does any other eu state ? 
  doubt it . 
  there 's nothing to defend . 
  ukraine could 've distanced itself from russia in the past 20 years , like most eastern states , yet it was it 's bitch just because they got a nice offer for gas . 
  plenty . 
  the only ones who do n't have it are the ukrainians . 
  tough luck for them . 
  yeah , but you see ... you 're a nobody . 
  because it 'll be more expensive . 
   it 's probably the same as in europe , at least in western europe . 
  in the uk , france , germany , etc. 
  private sector firms have a lot of influence over politicians too in romania that 's called influence trafficking , and the donations are bribes , and you go to prison for ` influencing ' politicians , or for being an ` influenced ' politician . 
  why did n't they vote otherwise then ? 
  at the last ellections ? 
  do n't companies heavily influence day-to-day politics in the us ? 
  i 'm fairly sure the us politicians who are doing the negotiating are already influenced . 
  who are these negotiators ? 
  so we can see who they 've received ` donations ' from ? 
  british trains are expensive as fuck . 
  does it work the same way when you throw the word ` terrorist ' around ? 
  you like to live dangerously , do n't ya ? 
  what with no / s tag and all . 
  so ... basically go through a process where a part brings evidence to support an allegation , a party defends against that allegation and the third one decides which of the first two parties is right . 
  known as a trial in most parts of the world . 
  and i 'd assume that all the aforementioned parties would need to be present at this trial . 
  for a country that is supposedly sucky to live in , they sure have a lot of wannabe-immigrants . 
  there 's a lot of em . 
  you could throw a rock in a crowd and hit 2 people who 've done dodgy stuff . 
  a judge can answer all of those questions , you ca n't , and should n't . 
  soooo . . why did it pass customs . 
  shoot them then . 
  fleeing is n't the only thing pretrial detention attempts to stop . 
  well , we know the names of 5 of em . 
  3 dead , 2 are currently on trial . 
  plenty more to go, 
  sounds like an attempt to give dyson a hand with sales , right ? 
  hehehe, 
  can we also send the people who have no desire , or will , to respect the constitution , or whatever the fundamental law behind the workings of a country are ? 
  how about the people who want to throw out the window the basic rights a person is born with ? 
  this well-thought out response , with so many counterpoints , does offer plenty of arguments and cites many reputable sources to invalidate / u/badblueboy146 's claims . 
  i applaud you for the intelectual prowess that you managed to show here . 
  you sir , should get into politics . 
  definitely . 
  that 's exactly why !, 
  how did you know ? 
  you 'll probably be sent to prison for being a sexual predator , and end up being shunned for life . 
  if you do n't get killed before that . 
  afaik , it was just given to them , no rent , just pay the bills . 
  they had to buy them after his fall though , from the state , which was reasonable . 
  edit : oh i misunderstood the question . 
  i do n't really know , to be honest .
