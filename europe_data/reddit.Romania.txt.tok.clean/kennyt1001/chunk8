  42 % of the romanian voters knew that voting for parties is idirect support for the president . 
  i 'd say that 's pretty damn decent for a country that started being democratic only 25 years ago . 
  is that seriously a link to yahoo ? 
  it 's the first time i 'm seeing a yahoo link on reddit , i shit you not . 
  it 's a conspiracy !!, 
  do n't you see it ? 
  they 're planning to build a secret robot army in the middle of the atlantic , or whatever , and they 'll trap all teh american forces in japan , somehow , and attack the us with robots afterwards . 
  it 's so obvious . 
  and 76.23 % of statistics are made up on the spot . 
  and the best person for a more democratic union is a democratically elected president . 
  uhm . . 
  i called you an ignorant piece of shit . 
  i think the ignorant distinction is quite important here . 
  can you quote the exact place where i said what you think i said ? 
  before the comment where i copied what you said that i said ? 
  and now give me figures . 
  tell me how much money leaves the country , and how much pays for the benefits of those that are n't ` immigrants ' . 
  i just googled quickly an article , [ here you go ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25880373 ) , cause you seem to be full of shit . 
  quote from the middle of that article :  when we do that , we see that between 1995-2011 , on average each eea immigrant put about # 6,000 more into the public purse than they took out . 
  i 'm obviously here for the benefit tourism , right ? 
   you have a toxic attitude towards british i have a toxic attitude towards ignorant pieces of shit like you who ca n't back up what they 're saying . 
  not only do you misquote me , you also call me stupid . 
   considering you 're living here , earning here and do n't forget , bringing my life savings with me , and ** paying taxes here . 
  **  enjoying the benefits afforded to every person living here . 
  because ** i 'm paying taxes here , in the uk ** not in romania . 
  or wherever the fuck i 'm from . 
  plus , i 'm not really unskilled . 
  all of this while i 'm open to discrimination , because whenever i say i 'm from romania i get funny looks from ignorant people . 
  yes , because why use common sense . 
  [ obviously romanions work harder than brits . 
  if anything they 'd deserve better pay then the unskilled brits . 
  so yeah deciding to live at home on jsa ... 
  i think that 's * exactly * how * it actually is * . ], 
  ( http://euobserver.com/social/124761 ), 
  i remember paying like 120 euros ( up to 150 , ca n't remember correctly ) 5 years ago , in romania . 
  you need to take the worst case scenario into account though . 
  right , / u/caw747 ? 
  i 'm not saying that i do n't like the large rooms , i 'm saying that i do n't like the number of rooms your average house has . 
  you know what i do n't like ? 
  that pretty much every single house is built for a family of 5 or more . 
  atm i 'm renting a room in a ' 4 bedroom house ' ( so sharing with 3 other people ) . 
  but we 've got 2 free rooms , that might aswell be called bedrooms , a huge living room , a dining room half the size of the living room , and a kitchen of the same size as the dining room . 
  that 's like ... so over the top ... that i do n't even ... and the bedrooms are also larger then needed . . 1 master , 2 that are half the size of the master , and the other 2 'em pty ' rooms are 3 quarters the size of the ` middle ' rooms . 
  i know , i totally know what you mean . 
  but even that decent salary might not be enough to own a house that he does n't have to share . 
  out of curiosity , did you see [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/houseprices/10924235/only-86-homes-for-sale-in-london-are-affordable-report-finds.html ) ? 
  that 's pretty sad ( if the numbers are true ) , and it 's not solely because of immigrants, 
  i 'm suggesting that if the market is competitive , they should compete . 
  if an immigrant who ca n't speak english as well as a brit , works at least as hard as a brit , is n't any more skilled than a brit , and still gets the job ... than i 'm suggesting that the brit is n't doing enough to get a job . 
  ugh ... and who would work those unskilled jobs that are now all available ? 
  the unskilled immigrants contribute more than the people who just decide to stay home for unemployment benefits . 
  it 's funny that you 're mentioning that ... in the uk immigrants contribute more than they receive currently . 
  yet you still have the situation they 're in . 
  are you trying out for a job as a presidential adviser ? 
  i know a certain someone who promised to raise those raised wages by 50 % during a certain campaign . 
  also , what 's your comment on the illegally cut pensions , that are costing us more now than they would 've if they just gave em out . 
  who were voted in by the people . 
  also interesting to note , was that there was n't a single vote against this 'em pty ' gesture . 
  so practically , it was as unanimous as you can get from a parliament with ~ 400 people . 
  mmmmm . . also the wages that were 50 % higher for teachers . . and the pensions that were n't cut illegally yet ... doctors still being able to be hired ... etc. 
  i hope to see a return to pre 2008 romania , economically speaking . 
  otherwise , i know what you mean . 
  but i do n't know how i feel about it . 
  no idea . 
  but each mandate is 5 years long , totalling at 10 years . 
  i feel fine with it , cause in my opinion more than 10 years might start becoming questionable whether it 's good or bad for the country . 
  edit : i 'm not sure if you 're talking about the mandates or his 2 family members being in trouble . 
  in case of the latter , do n't worry , one of his daughters is involved in shady business as well . 
  she just does n't have a criminal investigation , yet . 
  he will be replaced anyway ... you can only be a president for 2 mandates according to our constitution , and his 2nd one is about to end ( another 4-5 months ) . 
  but i think this has more to do with him having 2 people in his close family ( brother and son-in-law ) being investigated and one being already arrested . 
  i wrote a nice long comment with ` official ' romanian definitions to all the three terms and my findings and sources and links , but i accidentally clicked back on the mouse when switching between tabs and my comment got rekt . 
  i should 've saved more often ( did n't save at all ) . 
  my understanding of the ** nationality ** , as defined by our dictionary ( dex ) , is that it 's a group of people with a common language and culture , that was formed a given historical region . 
  and according to dex ** ethnicity ** is a group of people with a common language and traditions formed in time and space . 
  the difference between the two is the historical region part . 
  as i understand it , a person born in hungary is a hungarian national but can also be ethnically romanian , if romanian is his ` motherly tongue ' and practices romanian traditions . 
  and ** citizenship ** is a completely legal term , talking about a person 's status ( in regards to rights and whatever ) . 
  citizenship and nationality are synonyms , with the mention that they are improperly used as such ( in our great synonym dictionary ) . 
  as such , i think ethnicity is mostly used for minorities , and nationality for the majority of the people with the same language and culture . 
  i do n't know if you 're following me or not , but i learned quite a bit about a subject i had next to no knowledge about when i posted my first comment . 
   nationality , also called ethnicity nationality and ethnicity being one and the same is a german principle . 
  some countries follow that principle . 
  ( volkszugehoerigkeit ) but the french say that you can not be a french national by being born in france alone . 
  you also have to be a resident of france ( citizenship ) . 
   according to the french republic , the french people are those who are in possession of french nationality [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_nationality_law#french_citizenship_and_identity ) the way i interpret this is you can only be a french citizen if you are a french national and vice versa i guess that in the end , things are n't quite as simple as they seem . 
  ethnicity ( translated etnie ) is a new word in romania , only appearing in dictionaries at first in 1998, 
  nationality and citizenship ** are n't ** always identical . 
  in romania you can gain citizenship even if you are n't a romanian national . 
  romanian law follows both the jus sanguinis and the jus soli principles . 
  well ... 
  i remember reading that one of the companies that mentioned considering to pick up all their factories and move ( in case of ` brexit ' ) was nissan . 
  if they go , then all the other business that do a lot of work with them will lose money / people . 
  ** some ** businesses will fall like dominoes . 
  now , i personally , do n't mind nissan leaving the uk . 
  they might move to romania , especially with our latest tax cuts on big companies . 
  even though our infrastructure is shitty . 
  they have factories in spain providing access to western european market , and then opening new factories in romania , or poland , or whatever ... will provide easier access to the eastern market ( which ** is ** growing ) . 
  i 'm guessing the 3million number is a worst case ballpark figure , but i do n't know . 
  they could be involved .
