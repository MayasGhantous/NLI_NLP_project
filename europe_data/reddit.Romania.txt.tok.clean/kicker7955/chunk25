  why the fuck is their religion important ? 
  the number of angry militants is on the rise again . 
  this decade religion drives them . 
  that is so dirty on so many levels, 
  wtf poland ? 
  are you breeding arians in the south ? 
  i think you overestimate the mean european standard in regards to corruption , shadiness , inefficiency . 
  you do have a point in regard to infrastructure , but now with the 2 party state cronies and goverment can work together again and ~ ~ embezzel ~ ~ build some highways together . 
  i very much disagree . 
  i think only principles are identical , how we reach those principles and what prices we are willing to pay for them is very specific . 
  i think japanese principles of state byond all else would be unreasonable for a spaniard , i think even canadian liberalism would be tough to swallow by south american socialists . 
  there is no universal solution , there should n't be , but to integrate multiple views into a single political structure just makes the difficult impossible . 
  if you agree with our standards of human rights and democracy . 
  yeah sure . 
  but to be honest i think you have a long way culturally ... at least 50 years ( no offence , it think romania still has about 10 years to go ), 
  you 're cute , thinking that those cases are arbitrary, 
  their archives are processed by a small agency . 
  i do n't know , the total number and funny enough google ca n't find a clear answer . 
  http://www.iiccr.ro/pdf/ro/catalogue_iiccmre.pdf some documentation in english , but it 's pretty much bullshit . 
  some fled the country , others where just peraded a couple of years ago trough the media ( they where about 100 years old ) . 
  this is not for justice sake , but for pr . 
  the communist regime is just a talking point , like unemployment , we all hate it , lets argue who hates it the most . 
  the agency that prosecutes former agents did n't finish procesing his file yet . 
  aldough he did give several interviews and was kinda off a public figure , the subject of comunism horror is a recuring one in the media for when there is no scandal of the day . 
  ( in practice , the government needed some good pr with the 40 + electorate who still gives a shit about it . ), 
  so , whats your point ? 
  is it a repost ? 
  u.s.a !, 
  u.s.a !, 
  u.s.a !, 
  edit : https://vine.co/v/myh3tmybn9x ` merica , liberating and spreading freedom all over the globe , including in america !, 
  can we just all go piss on a church , like in support or protest or something ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ( do n't ^ ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ - ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ piss ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ church ), 
  i do n't know , it just works , it 's definitely not a `` imperial pearl '' anymore but you see less modernism even that a lot of western cities . 
  omg , it 's happening , they 're conquering us from the inside !, 
  nothing to see in romania , just move on people !, 
  this sounds wierdly familiar ... i thing the americans stole some of it, 
  user name checks out ... he 's legit, 
  this is original euro trash , [ blue grass ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmjfw9rznrs ) would be your closest alternative . 
  it 's a romanian saying ... no olive oil required , as the italians would say ( just kidding , they would never say that , they do in fact eat their olive oil `` raw '' just with bread ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_poland_ ( 1025 % e2 % 80 % 931385 ), 
  i agree , it 's just fun . 
  so what do you call the first polish kingdom ? 
  similar experience here , the nineties and the first glimpses of capitalism where like the wild ( w ) est !, 
  we 're 33  ) that is funny , this is so western biased it 's almost sad, 
  why ? 
  so we could just artificially pump up the numbers and trade in today 's nominal growt for future debt and inflation down the road ? 
  fuck that , fuck `` scary '' numbers , fuck perpetual growth . 
  unless you own stock or have debt you do n't care about that shit . 
  the role of the government is to maintain a system that ensures the best outcome for all citizens . 
  the current financial system fails at that and it has no right to demand we support it in perpetuity when `` the trickle down '' effect is smaller and smaller with every concession governments make . 
  people need to understand that they currently live in debt , stop masking that with even more debt . 
  europe needs to take a stand and say only organic growt allowed . 
  financial gains from operations are banned , if you have money and want to make more you invest and get dividends like old school bankers did . 
  you gain profit from creating utility . 
  yes they will leave , but i do n't care , because their capital is unreliable capital , capital that at best only affects a business practice at worst it blackmail government . 
  money is a asset , it is not power it is not intrinsic utility , you treat it as such and you do n't alow it to have a vote . 
  some people can not not have a opinion on what other people do . 
  add them to the 1300 ukrainian civilian casualties . 
  death is death . 
  just because you are not directly involved by nationality does n't make it more tragic , they like your co nationals are just externalities in the fight for the interests of greater men . 
  that is because `` rational '' people think in terms of `` bad '' guys do bad things . 
  funny almost always the `` bad '' guys are `` the other '' guys . 
  no , it 's still in effect . 
  no , it is n't efficient , it 's very subsidiesed , especially in france . 
  well it would lead to all out inflation of a couple of percent points . 
  the reason supermarkets can afford to put on sale only perfect products ( which are inforced by the eu by the way ) is because they are cheap enough so they can afford to do so . 
   buy the same amount of food . 
  no they wont it 's going to be to expensive , supermarkets do n't supply by intuition they have the ability to make the most of it , it 's just to cheap to care and having fresh young beutifull apples is great merchandising strategy when you cal literally afford to trow away the bad apples . 
   that being said , the government itself could buy the leftover food from the supermarkets horrific idea , you will see price gauging worst than in the cocaine market during the 80s , you are already helping out the supermarkets on the production side , do n't help them on the retail side as well . 
  i think you missed my point , when being homless is france is better than being a telecomunication engeener in minsk , you have a systemic problem . 
  you need to make that imigrant a worker in france so he adds value rather than just consumes resource . 
  this thread makes it up for it http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/2d0kbf/sumar_emisiuni_antena_3_08082014/, 
  what political connections are n't toxic in romania, 
  the us actually had 2 different waves of `` wiring '' the second of which was payed by the government but the isp 's spent the money and never finished `` spreading '' the fiber . 
  good job op , your title made me lol, 
  more money for the us then . 
  principles , making exclusive profits for the american military industrial complex since 1850 . 
  to be fair comunism did accelarate our growt exponentially . 
  if you take into account our balcanic style of governing that growt would have taken place in 80 or 140 years . 
  they do n't know about our former industrial cities, 
  thank you for contributing to the discussion, 
  climate change yes , you need to work with industry not cut them out of the discussion so you can pander to your constituency so they invest in political capital rather than change . 
  authoritarianism exists so does democracy , `` we 'll see which ones outlives the other '' ( that is just retarded ), 
  first of all , big corporations can not complain about the economy . 
  just by trimming their company 's fat they can finance a small deficit . 
  secondly , he and his industry is part of the problem so attracting attention to the frailty of the financial market and the instability of the bond market in which they are heavily involved . 
  but every horrible system ever was built on either that ambition or a reaction of the disenfranchised created in pursuit of that ambition . 
  dialog is the only way for sustainable peace and a better world . 
  actually it was created for economic interest , all big geopolitical movement are based on that , the together we ca n't start wars bullshit is just feel good propaganda . 
  you realise that you are asking for a dictatorship of liberals . 
  if that sounds great your judgement is clouded by feel good rhetoric . 
  there is no optimal way to govern , the best we can do is set a direction wanted by the majority then find solutions for the issues that occur with the contribution of all . 
  both the un and the council are democratic constructs . 
  they are not supposed to let any single will impose themselves in front of another . 
  exactly for all of us . 
  saying you know better , is insulting , self righteous and counter productive in the long term . 
  cool , now give the un the powers of the eu and world peace is in within reach . 
  yes . 
  and again yes , not only given voice but respected .
