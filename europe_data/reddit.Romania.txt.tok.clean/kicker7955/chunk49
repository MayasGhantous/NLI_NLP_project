  i find them to be the only bastion of real gonzo journalism left everyone else prepackages the news . 
  tell me the event and i can write the whole bbc , fox or cnn news story news is more a `` prefiltered '' reality show than reality . 
  and to acuse vice , that they use rawness as a selling point is to exempt other news outlets from doing the same thing but with stories interpreted in preexisting biases and fears . 
  at least with vice you can choose how you feel about it . 
  take this video , some see conspiracies , others anti russian propaganda , i , as a eastern european that knows how blatant corruption can be , feel nothing , however posting this i do feel disheartened of how wide the cultural gap is between idealistic western social justice warriors and eastern nihilism is , and i fear this will become more apparent as the economic gap closes up . 
  this is the kind of interpretation mainstream news does not allow , the emotional charge is already prepackaged , bagged and color coded , the only option for the viewer ( let 's be honest ) is either to assimilate it or reject it as biased . 
  no discussion , no grey zone . 
  again it falls under the lets circumvent the law ( because it 's diffult ) to give central autorities power , without the electorate knowing about it . 
  the law is bureaucratic hell because radical measures can be abused and beureacracy makes it difficult for this to happen . 
  why not due away with it , it is within they 're power , then the politicians would have to assume responsibility for their actions and not just argue against the bureaucratic mastodon ( from both sides ) . 
  also simplifying the bureaucratic process would also create milestones and make the ecb stick to a predetermined strategy , therefor making the whole process transparent and its architects stand by their actions . 
  also this measure basically asks of germans to acumulate debt for southerners , and beyond politeness i am sure that if the tables would be reversed , southern countries would n't agree to such a thing especially given the historical tensions . 
  the `` euro '' ( as in the economic and political status quo ) has been treated like an objective , all decisions where of self conservation by the system , and because the european `` government '' lacks powers , the eu gave de facto powers to the ecb to save the euro . 
  now those powers enabled measures that probably ( just a opinion ) saved the euro , but also affected sovereign debt and germans do n't like debt . 
  now the point can be made , that because germany is in the eurozone , `` we 're all in this together '' should be the predominant attitude but that would hurt national politics , and that is the de facto source of political power at this time , both for the eu and national governments . 
  so at this time we are heading toward a quite absurd cycle of local politicians opposing euro measures , european authorities circumventing unanimity and eu laws to be able to fix the issues , which raises even more euroskepticism and fuels even more the local politicians dissent . 
  my question is where is the line ? 
  how much authority does a semi autonomous eu institution get ? 
  why do we maintain the indirect system of voting for local politicians which in term make decisions that do n't sacrifice their political power or eligibility in the next election ? 
  and most importantly , has the euro zone become synonymous with the the countries that form it from a long term political and economic interest ? 
  i find it disheartening that a country can never exit the eurozone at this time and as a result the only sustainable option is to increase the power of the european cetral autority to make it work regardless of consequences , but without any political adjustments . 
  it is quite possible that in a decade or so we have an extremely powerful central authority that is unbounded by laws ( that it signs itself ) or local politicians ( that do n't have a consensus ) . 
  and completely out of touch with the wishes of its electorate . 
  the only catch up eco has made is because of subsidies , it more expensive as an investment , less efficient as a cost per mw and less reliable in the long term . 
  nuclear has payed of every single time , and the fossil subsidies is because we are a humane society that frowns upon poor people freezing to death . 
  no , you use what is more cost efficient and provides the most organic output , the `` all of the things '' attitude should be reserved to middle school term papers . 
  actually , no and a big one for that , most energy markets are interconected , you can literally buy everything you need if your productivity is insanely high . 
  you will never be able to produce green energy at the cost of algeria . 
  ( except nuclear ) . 
  but you have a tourist tradition , that will make you more attractive to foreign money than algeria at least for the foreseeable future . 
  now if you use that money wisely , not on populist and short minded projects or idealistic green socialist immature ambitions , and prop up a solid tech sector and service economy you will become a solid economy be the time algeria becomes more attractive to tourists . 
  it 's easy in hindsight to see the problems the euro brought to ireland but most of the growth came from easy capital that would n't have been as plentiful if tnot for the eurozone . 
  becoming a strong economy is dependent on state liquidity and a healthy macroeconomic environment , and large financial markets ( like london ) tends to atract both , so i would expect the independent scottish economy not to be really that stable ( at least at first witouth a sort of liquidity funnel from the ruk , but this would limit national autonomy and taxing oportunities ) . 
  but i do n't have the numbers , so it just a teory on my part . 
  both protectionism and the open door policy are viable . 
  only the future scottish chancellor can actually decide , we wo n't see the books only after they 're closed . 
  i do not know the numbers but i do have a grasp of how trade works . 
  the larger economy in general is more competitive , and simultaniously both profits and inhibits competitivity in the smaller economy . 
  as per this particular case , scottish companies compete with larger english companies , but in general do not sell as much in england as the english sell in scotland ( because of their size difference ) . 
  given a trade tax , scotish exporters and importers would suffer ( but now they can adapt to the eu market given that there is less of a financial difference to working with the uk ) , but they are but a few when compared with local producers , manufacturers and retailers that wo n't be forced to compete with already established english competitors . 
  and at the end of the fiscal year the government works on taxes , if there is no economic base to tax , you either reduce expense ( rarely happens ) , borrow ( at insane rates given you are a new economy ) or tax the people ( i guarantee the scottish electorate will hate that more than a trade tax ), 
  if ireland would n't have joined , it would have been dependent exclusively on the uk . 
  the tech or software development , construction boom all the explosive growth of the celtic tiger was a consequence of easy capital and business opportunities gain from eu . 
  popular opinion does n't realize how fragile a economy supported by a couple of million people is , within 3 years the necessity of a life raft will become apparent , only the rich can afford to be conservative ( euroskeptic in this case ) . 
  yes , and this would make scottish products more appealing , this in term rises scottish companies revenues , which allows them to grow , hire more people and pay more taxes ( beyond what the income the government would actually raise from taxing imports ), 
   it is likely that `` no '' will win the day in the referendum , so therefore the question will not even arise . 
  i know , but even the gesture can have resounding effects in 4 to 6 years . 
   it will definitely be in ruk 's interests for scotland to be in the eu . 
  except that if scotland is not in the eu she will still be politically and economically dependent on the uk most of your questions suppose that scotland is a special case , catalonia will be a special case as it is in the eurozone . 
  for practicality i think scotland will be treated as a seprate entity , and all the political steps respected , i think they will try to go for the euro as soon as posible . 
  i do not think they will exit out of shengen or the `` poundzone '' rather again for reasons of practicality , they will be on a theoretical `` trial '' period until the political bureaucracy comes to resyncs with reality . 
  small economy , after a political shock , it will be attacked by vultures trying to get a foothold before the political environment gets a grip on the situation . 
  i would try to protect my self from my neighbors . 
  at the end of the day , they are n't scottish companies that pay scottish laborers and scottish taxes . 
  we shall see how the waters settle after the referendum, 
   i know who my money is on to come out on top and because you invoked the bigger is better argument cultural issue = collective psychie, 
  to counter balance the anglocentrism or / r/europe, 
  what would they ever do , they 're going to regres to medieval ways in no time . 
  england is going to veto scotish admission anyway . 
   60 million versus 4 million people , i know who my money is on to come out on top . 
  me to , if we where in medieval times , cause you know might equals right  oh and `` empire '' really . 
  ffs yes , look at how unwelcome my satiric comment is , when it comes to imperialistic pride , the `` empire '' is still a realistic cultural issue with you guys, 
  yes there is , most heavy industry is dependent on robotics ( not the other way around ) in the eu , traditional factories are dramatically noncompetitive on the world scene , you are grabing on to an already old business model just for the sake of the `` old generation '' also 15 years of gradual change is significantly less damaging to the business environment than 5 years of drastic change in a inflationary global economy reliant on depleting carbon fuels . 
  best example post ww2 japan , it did n't take the western route of manufacturing and small business , it built for the future despite not having the natural resources and world comerce being quite expensive at that time , they chose to make high value goods made in humane factories , that where expensive at first but slowly their products became superior to traditional western factories and the +20 years experience advantage in managing resource imports prove the edge in the price wars for mid 20th century consumer products . 
  that sounds like a bluf . 
  somebody really needs to teach the british than nobody needs them , listen up you scots , this is what you do , step 1 you invent a new currency ( scotish crown crs ) , pegged to the euro/pound average , low monetary volume will make it vulnerable in the short term and pegging it will make monetary speculations more difficult , this will also support trade and eu ambitions step 2 , tax the empire , i assume most medium sized companies are local and foreign companies could hamper their growth potential step 3 , make a business friendly tax code , like ireland step 4 , enjoy british tears, 
  heavy industry is not the future , services tech and robotics is this measure is meant to force us to become the first large scale economy that is n't relaiand on opec it is a strategic measure meant for long term results i am no friend to the eco warriors but increasing renewable sources is the correct way to do this , not for the environment , but for the long term economic growth and autonomy . 
  edit : also the `` we need to beat the us '' is a immature war cry , we need to be ** better ** than the us and china , we do not sacrifice future development or human dignity for power and the pride of our leaders , i want the eu to remain faithful to its citizens and not compete in a rat race that does more harm to its citizens than benefits them . 
  no , just for abuses done by `` our '' politicians * our - as in born in the same geographical area , but in my opinion if someone does politics in bucharest he is a bucharestian politician and when he comes back he is a local poltician, 
   during the [ ** former pm 's ** ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_boc ) * to be fair we had a former inteligece service oficial as pm between boc and ponta for about 3 months ( but he has just a political dick extension for basescu ), 
  just saying that if they where more polite , when the new administrative divisions would have been drawn a unified magyar region would have been a given and because of the precedence set by the comunists not even the nationalists would have complained . 
  from there like scotland and the basyue autonomy would have been a natural process . 
  no , my argument is that they used the situation for political gains and instead of breaching the gap , they made it wider intentionaly to pose as essential to the magyar electorate . 
  transylvania is finacially stable and more homogeneusly developed macroeconomically , from redistricting to autonomy is just a matter of time and a failed govemental budget . 
  there are whispers , they tend not to be loud because the confusion with the magyar movement is easy to make . 
  but let 's say transilvanians kinda hated all the money the socialists directed at moldova ( during the first 15 years after communism , it can be argued it needed the help , how much was diverted to private interests we will probably never know ) . 
  so there is a strong hatred toward bucharestian politics , over here . 
  during the former pm 's ( former and present mayor of cluj ) mandate he placed his people all trough the goverment ( a really incompetent goverment when dealing with the finacial crisis ) , redirected a lot of funds toward his local friends ( a lot of money ) and basically did nothing to oppose the presidents abuse of the media , the justice system , foreign policy , and intelligence services . 
  so it 's fair to say that transylvanian politics is not really looked upon with kind eyes since then by the rest of the country . 
  the pm 's case was a joke , it was a political coup de gras , a political fuck you to the former `` supreme ruler '' . 
  actually the communist started the policy , that is what `` autonomy '' meant for the soviets ( everywhere ) , you feed their national ego but literally starve them . 
  these idiots just neglected everything and the poorer parts of moldova valahia and hargita/kovaszna took it the hardest . 
  i think they deserve a decent life and a brighter future for the next generation . 
  and i do n't think , speaking as a economist that that can be attained trough autonomy , the do n't have the economic strength to prosper alone , yes it 's not there fault but the fact remains . 
  that is why a bigger autonomous region would be the best solution , as i said i 'd even give them to hungary , despite that being politically impossible . 
  no , stop arguing the natural resources card , we easterners should know better than that , you can literally have money grow on trees if the political climate is filled with short minded corrupt assholes , it is worthless , and the state of the corruption in that area is ridiculous . 
  nothing is a hassle for our politicians cause they don + t give a fuck , except for reelection they just do their own thing and let the rest of us live . 
  the attitude towards the subject of autonomy is poisoned . 
  because rmdsz used a lot of anti romanian rhetoric trough all these years . 
  so at the basic level above all else its just a ego thing , do n't let rmdsz win , despite the fact that objectively they would hate the most to lose . 
  but as i previously stated , i think your aproach of hungarians must rule hungarians no matter what , is the same ego trip just with different colors , your putting a principle in front of what is objectively better for the people , especial now , since there are no borders between budapest and miercurea-ciuc . 
  maybe your movement could take a more hands on approach to help your brethren , bypassing local coruption and rmdsz 's political games . 
  it bigger than the hungarian thing , we basically have 3 major parties but about 7 to 8 interest groups , so they decided that the honorable thing to do is to split up the country and stop the internal fighting . 
  fair enough , my opinion is that it is irrelevant anyway , because our current situation is a recent developent and nationalism is retarded . 
  a good example is the we can be represented only by others like us , in my brief brush with local politics i encountered this stupid etnic rational both from the romanians and the hungarians , it baffles me to this day , that you think `` one of your own '' , despite proving time and time again to be corrupt and incompetent , is still the only `` acceptable '' option . 
  and i have no qualm with hungary taking the whole region under its borders , i just do n't get why the fuck does it matter ? 
  sibiu is governed by the germans for about 15 years now and it 's progress is amazing , why does autonomy matter so much . 
  hungarians have learn to balme everything on bucharest , like local politicians are non-existent . 
  i think all eastern national patrimony where raped by the privatization fashion , and imf loans , blame the imf and the academic understanding of what makes a competitive economy for those . 
  also all eastern politicians took a cut if they where offered the opportunity .
