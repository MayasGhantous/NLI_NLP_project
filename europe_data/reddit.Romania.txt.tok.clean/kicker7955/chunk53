  just pointing out how superficial these ecological fixes are . 
   long trips on a hilly highway eruopean cities have hills , hiways do n't ( also modern economical cars because the run at higher rpm on highways are actually less economical than a standard diesel )  an electric vehicle is better suited in the first case i agree but due to the high cost , a bicicle or public transport still makes more sense , coviniece and ecological reason in those cases . 
   but i 'm sure that wo n't address your hill problem either  i 'm a metro and taxi kinda guy . 
   ( there are some damning critical comments below the article as well , check them out . ), 
  this is n't the article i was referencing , i just found it on google so you wo n't dismiss my argument for the lack of `` sources '' , weird place the internet , a rational argument is less valuable than a semi + related idea backed by a published we article . 
  poor germany  ), 
   it 's not as if there 's not competition possible within ecological limits . 
  that does n't address the results on power consumption either . 
  this is quite a complex , issue and i could go further in if you 'd like , the main issue is real markets do n't work like macreconomic models , irl a company will use every chance it has to maximize profits , and regulation changes are the perfect opportunities to raise the whole market . 
  if we where talking about a lot of suppliers i.e. 
  bread market , then a cartel behavior would be more difficult ( not impossible , as my country proved this in the fall of last year ) . 
  when you have a handfull of producers a cartel behavior is certain , and due to the regulatory shifts it is imposible to prove without auditing the companies that this behavior took place . 
   we have to get rid of the idea that using more power automatically means better performance , and these norms are a good step in that direction . 
  they have to compete on performance , not on powersucking . 
  using less power = less performance , you can use a lot of power and have low performance , but technologically the balance of performance vs power consumption is reached by high end devices that are very expensive , the industry ca n't literally get better performances using current technology . 
  http://www.greenoptimistic.com/2011/12/29/europe-co2-emissions-2012/ is it enough ? 
  or do you want the actual law ? 
  here you go http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acea_agreement engine emisions are a direct consequence of consumtion , consumtion goes down with weight , the heaviest component of a car is the engine , smaller engines = less powerfull engines , because the we do n't have the tehnology to not compromise on power . 
  this move in practice meant keeping the class categories i.e. 
  small hatch of 9 000 euros is now is made of cheap plastic and has a 1 000 cc engine , good ( debatably ) for the enviroment , good for eu politicians that seek idealist green voters , good for the company ( cheaper car sold for the same money ) , bad for consumers that need to climb hills . 
  i was protesting the cheap cars , that we 're usable before these regulations . 
  no that does n't mean that , but we do not have the technology to build a affordable ecological car . 
  i expect the consumer to not be fucked over beacause of his naivete , i expect usable products not `` politically correct '' useless products that may not even effect the environment at all only make politicians and companies look concerned . 
  i read a great article that went more in debt on all `` eco tech '' and what a sham they are but this will suffice . 
   using less energy as consumers will automatically reduce the demand and profit margins of major industries too ... while curbing energy production without reducing demand will just causes price spikes and blackouts . 
  no , modern ecologically compliant products are more expensive , have higher margins and have the added benefit of not having to compete with non-eco products because those become illegal . 
  i am not a news outlet , but i 'll try to be as compliant as posible . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10423431/eu-energy-saving-rules-cut-power-of-vacuum-cleaners.html sry ca n't find a source for the car engine displacement , but ask any one that drove cars 20 years ago , and he will confirm it . 
  assesment of utily , go to the nearest auto dealer and drive the cheapest car they have , it 's probably going to have a eco badge on it cause its simply bad marketing to say it 's under-powered and do a drive test , find a hill and climb it . 
  while concerning the vaccum cleaner issus , if you are asking for a utility assessment , i can only deduce you either never used a vacuum cleaner of never used a good one . 
  * edit : * anything under 1600 is unsanitary especially for small children or people with astma , and anything under 1200 is uterly useless . 
  also the biggest household electrical consumer by far is a fridge , but if you would regulate that to such a level that it ca n't do the task you bought it for , you would have a salmonella outbreak within weeks and outright outcries for governmental incompetence . 
   denmark may become the first country to ban non therapeutic circumcisions of boys . 
  israel is not so pleased of course . 
  [ 2 ] it 's settled , denmark is the greatest country in the world, 
  no but they thought that if it 's not mediterranean adjacent is more a hassle than anything else , kinda like how westerners view the east . 
  also alexander the great reached persia , and despite westerners not really caring about them until the 20 ` th century the cumans , mongols , and otomans where a big european deal for most of our history, 
  the iranian border , caspic sea , kazakstan border and the ob river , despite not liking them , the middle east is closer historically to europe than the indian subcontinent , also what you westerners see as european history is in fact western european history , you have the same geographical bias as the roman empire . 
  in my previous experiences when external interests are pushing for an unpopular decision , politicians push that decision to after they get reelected , even the ones that do n't serve those external interest see the delay and use it for political capital . 
  how the fuck does the idea : ** it 's ok to be romantically interested in people regardless of gender ** get translated into : ** you must have gay sex , before primary school if possible **, 
  this does n't sound good , but i am fearfull of politicians in general so maybe i 'm reading to much into this . 
  wtf !?!, 
  can somebody please elaborate , it may be out of context :  the germans support the regulation but do not want it applied to the public sector . 
  `` obviously the german government is against european-wide common rules . 
  this behaviour is irresponsible against the eu citizens , '' said albrecht . 
  this is what happens when there are n't tabloid scandals , news people got ta eat , stupid people got ta be horrified and politicians got ta get screen time . 
  but seriously , in a country with such a poor infrastructure and such a bureaucratic government 4 and a half hours to reach a crash site in the mountains is n't unreasonable , firing a minister over this shit however is just plain retarded , and shows just how replaceable those people are and how little individual value they bring to the government . 
  the expectancy for every event to be micromanaged by government offices ( i.e. 
  people who you seemed on tv ) is absurd and a inheritance of the party state system , and this is what truly makes me sad , because it genuinely effects more people than the 2 deaths in a aviation accident . 
  og security state over here !, 
  friends and family do n't count views are generally well knowned and nobody walks away with a different perception . 
  in western countries not every `` traditionalist '' is an arrogant bastard , they have valid concernes , but lack unbiased knowledge , they live in a bubble when it comes to controversial subjects , because they know they are instantly judged because of their opinion . 
  a couple of days ago the results of a poll concerning what members of / r/christianity thought about homosexuals , and 80 + % argued that they are sinners and love hates them and so on , but another question was do you think they should be banned by positions within the church and only under 20 % thought so . 
  i 'm sorry i cant find the tread but it consolidates my view that people do n't have different sized `` empathy bones '' we just develop them in different circumstances . 
  and `` conservative shaming '' just accentuates the problem while quick fixing the symptoms . 
  i do n't want to say i have a unique perspective , but it 's different . 
  in romania liberalism is inexistent , any political front in fact is non-existent ( the labels are there but they mean nothing ) , but we matured culturally very much in the last 20 years despite this . 
  and i think this type of open dialog without shame between people of different views without moral highgrounds is more beneficial and transformative than censorship for the sake of not offending . 
  2 personal experiences to support this : last year i was talking to a taxi driver about marriage and so on and the subject of gay marriage came up , i presented my case , he automatically assumed i 'm gay ( cause why would i care about faggots otherwise ) and i encouraged him , the second he saw i do n't have 3 horns and i do n't have a 5 year old as a slave his perspective changed , seeing this i reiterated his earlier complaints about being married , and i asked why he thinks gay people do n't have gelous , possessive or abusive partners , the expression on his face was priceless . 
  yes there was a chance he could have beaten me up , and in some heated moments , i really taught that was a possibility , but it was a saturday and i really did n't have anything planned . 
  another taxi driver was once going on a tirade about how horrible muslim immigrants are ( and they really are , think arrogant spoiled rich kids with disposable income and not a care in the world ) at tipping , and i argued that tipping is n't a world wide habit , and hassling is quite common in the middle east , his point was that in romania you behave like romanians , then i asked him if he knows how to behave in a muslim country , he deflected but finally admitted that he would find it difficult , i then closed by pointing our that he has 20 + years of live experience on those kids and his judgement was misguided ( although as i mentioned most are douchebags ) in a `` modern liberal '' country true dialog is nonexistent , because you are denying the possibility to express your ideas ( banning nazi symbolism or just by making it acceptable to shame them into submission ) if you are on the `` traditionalist side '' . 
  speech can hurt i agree , but by silencing that speech we are imposing different standards and freedoms based on beliefs and that is no different that the anti gay propaganda laws in russia . 
  of course we do n't have neo-nazis torturing and humiliating conservative adolescents but the political principle is the same . 
  njd argued that societies are n't tolerant , you said that you disagree and that when it comes to rights people accept minorities despite not agreen with them . 
  i wanted to point out that civility has it 's limits when a apparently ethical conundrum appears . 
  this is the difference between true acceptance ( you are free to fail , shit happens ) and fear of being labeled a bigot , and when the time comes , voting is anonymous so that fear disappears . 
  you just need one religious nutter elected into office and all that `` enforced '' progress disappears . 
  modern liberalism tackles linguistics rather than hate unfortunately . 
  this is also why extremism pops-up suddenly and from apparent tolerant societies . 
  would you be ok with gay couples adopting ? 
  the issue with marriege is one of politics and the only reason the west seems more tolerant is because there are liberal advocates that condemn discrimination . 
  the same type of people argue over here for conserving traditional values . 
  you are not more accepting you are just more censored . 
  i use the gay adoption issue to point this out . 
  because there is no argument that on average a child raised by gay parents is in a bigger risk than any other couple , i.e. 
  dysfunctional couples will screw up a child and that is likely to happen regardless of the gender of the partners . 
  and i would argue because of contextual coercion that leads to many heterosexual couples forming or staying together despite obvious incompatibility , the % of unhealthy relationships is higher for heterosexuals . 
  i was refering to this : http://gigaom.com/2014/01/23/net-neutrality-just-got-a-boost-in-europe-thanks-to-a-consumer-rights-committee/ and the tread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vxxwz/net_neutrality_just_got_a_boost_in_europe_thanks/, 
  so i 've seen [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zftc0v.png ) and i have to ask wtf are the you , northerners doing right , especially denmark , is it a glitch in the data or have you somehow discovered the solution to `` the lost generation '' ? 
  because societies are based on familiarity derived from similarity and distancing themselves from anything different . 
  one of the biggest challenges of modern man is to reject tribal instincts and embrace absolute individualism and equality . 
  first the net neutrality verdict and now this , good week europe , very good . 
  if you think about it , is n't it fundamentally human to try to impose your morals on all members of your species . 
  and using society as a coercive mechanism against behavior different than your own . 
  i 'm sorry for the misunderstanding in that case . 
  japan 's big industries have control over regulation , also , how about we learn from 20th century americano-centrism and sign fta 's with countries that are less competitive than us , that `` both sides win '' is really propaganda unless the two markets have very big structural differences . 
  that 's why an fta with china would benefit the eu more that one with the us . 
  in practice i find people that are less skilled , have no wroking experience or are just really in need of a job , to not be that picky . 
  well in that case , as the representative of the romanian people i would like to purchace 19944 thickets , window side only please . 
  responsible government is a nordic exception again i do n't think communism or the lack of democratic elections was the issue . 
  the abuse was just a particular application of the stalinist model , like early ussr romania was very rural , and was rapidly industrialized . 
  this made support for the party skyrocket , on that support state power increased , responsibility towards the well being of the people diminished and abuse followed naturally . 
  i understand that , but the problem was n't communism , it was the perpetuity of the government , and the constant feeling of fear and powerlessness . 
  before ceusescu 's regime , communism was n't all that bad . 
  ouch , well that is quite embarrassing but my issue is that 3 % of german electorate is 1.2 milion ( given a voting presence of 50 % ) in the curent framework germany has one mep per 800 000 people . 
  that seat is significant especially if the party is a fringe european movement based on smaller countries . 
  i find it different than national parliamentary elections , where you just need a ruling party or alliance , because of its trans national nature , a german 3 % can be very important for the ep . 
  flat society , ... state serves the people ... what ?!?!, 
  my cynical post communist brain had a breakdown trying to understand those concepts, 
  no , invent as in being creative to make the bottom line greener example : secretary & data procesor is registered as a sales person so she gets paid under 200 euros base salary , but given her office duties she ca n't really go out on sales jobs so she is stuck working overtime for a decent income .
