  that 's probably why sweeden takes in asmany immigrants as germany . 
  with global warming kicking in , lands further north would be ripe to be integrated even further into the economy , and they would play a bigger role in the future . 
  sry but that is pure fantasy yeah , that isn ; t going to happen , i give the monarchy 20 years before social inequality brings those smug assholes down in revolutionary flames , you thought the greeks know how to make a car fire , just you wait . 
  nordic alliance , please do ... however i do n't think sweden , could get along in the long run with denmark and norway despite all that oil money is reluctant to give it away . 
  no that is an american myth most of the new tech sector was financed and developed by the american government either directly trough grants or by subsidised credit , venture capital does n't take risks with new sectors . 
  believe me the only difference is that americans encourage development and we stick with old companies . 
  yes there are regional factors and politics but what it boils down to is that they are n't afraid of risk . 
  every country has skeletons in their closet , that even its citizens do n't know about , why do you think the euro was rushed , why do you think paris insists on regional development or the uk still remains in the eu despite the political divergence . 
  in 10-20 years you wo n't be able to blame the east , and most of the south , , and then you will still be reliant on 20th century industries and complain about not being competitive , because the policy has to change , companies do n't need government to hold their hand , and if they do , they do n't deserve to occupy the market and should move out of the way and let new , more dynamic companies fill in the gap . 
  actualy friedman argues for shareholders to be contractually binded to the company for longer periods of time , so they do n't think short term . 
  it was n't outsourcing , it was time , you ca n't maintain a company in the long term if you do n't adapt , think about how much our consumer behavior changed only in the last 5 years . 
  economics is n't some dark art created by our corporate overlords , its an behavioral pathern shaped by society , it is generated by people and people change , you ca n't expect companies not to and become dependant on subsidies because people do n't want to change jobs . 
  ( another modern day problem ) protectionism is useless in the long term . 
  consumers want global products , businesses require the most advanced contractor to be competitive . 
  and nationalism is useless when it comes face to face with the will of individuals , even in sweden , if you give it time . 
  my point stands , kick them out and offer them a hotel voucher for their next visit . 
  this is my point , the emigration framework is broken , you ca n't expect a person to have no place to stay having no job and somehow by liberal voodoo integrate . 
  its not the concept but the way it is applied . 
  you ca n't power trough with keynesian capital without developing th economy . 
  how does n't service economy work , look at silicon valley . 
  the main problem i found after the nsa leaks is that there are n't any european service providers worth a damn , and then i thought to myself , where is european added value ? 
  i could not think of a european company that boomed in the last 20 years of internet developent , almost all of our big companies are old comapnies , because westerners have focused on keeping old industry alive by subsidies and leave little to no money for new technology startups . 
  new tech works , its worked from brooklyn to bahrain , but european politicians are under pressure by traditional industry to artificially keep them alive . 
  it is the job of local politics to say fuck you america , we can build a local amazon , a local gmail , a local paypal , that is faster , cheaper and works better than yours ( please replace audible ) . 
  i do n't want to make bets , but you should keep an eye on the development of new tech in the baltic states and portugal , they left the old behind and are striving to become incubators for new industry that can service all of europe , and maybe even china and india , why not take their money . 
  no form of protection can be implemented against cheaper labor , what you need is production capabilities that make your labor more efficient . 
  as in : logistical cost + 10 chinese workers become more expensive than an automated production line manned by 3 swedish workers . 
  you want the benefits of globalisation you need the cost to , protectionism is expensive and ineffective ( unless you 're an island nation like the uk or cuba ) . 
  and about that free ride , you need to understand that globalism is encouraged by western capitalist societies not out of pity , but out of self interest , those cheap workers make a western company competitive , not only at home , but all over the world . 
  in fact being able to produce a scalable economy ( more products means less cost per individual product ) is making western companies so competitive they absolutely destroy any local competition in weaker economies . 
  and literally make producers import the products they manufacture . 
  this is why you have coke costing less that water in africa , clothes produced in se asia sent back as foreign aid and so on . 
  or ikea furniture ( sorry to use such a cliche but it fits the bill ) made from romanian wood ( via hungary and illegal deforestation ) being cheaper than traditional furniture manufacturers that go out of business , leaving ikea not only the cheapest alternative but the only option . 
  the thing with society is , it rarely returns to a previous equilibrium , kinda like rivers . 
  you ca n't really do anything about it , unless there is an international force majeure that somehow changes individual values and expectation ; you can however steer society to a better more equitable future , take the present and build a future on it . 
  do all of those people have jobs ? 
  houses ? 
  pay taxes ? 
  respect your rights ? 
  if the answers to any of these is no , deport their asses , if it 's yes to all , i do n't agree with your point of view . 
  i totally agree any action has to come from within to be legitimate , that 's why political parties should stay out of the matter , the eu and russia ( at least in theory ) should to . 
  politicians will have their comfortable political position with or without the eu , ( i 've seen it happen , cockroaches die easier than corrupt politicians ) but the decision will have a much greater impact on the masses . 
  the humanity ... ... it sounds delicious . 
  i respect your opinion but disagree . 
  the doors of eu expansion are n't opened indefinitely , and in no way is the idea that `` europe needs ukraine '' a healthy mindset to approach integration . 
  i understand wanting a period of independence after russian dominance , but i personally find nothing more retarded than putting nationalism in front of the well being of citizens .

  ** ^ happy ^ new ^ year ^ / r/europe ^ !, 
  well that was unexpected , where there any casualties ? 
  your headlines are onion worthy , i would rotfl , if hungarian nationalism would n't scare me, 
  i like hayek 's sociological approach to the economy , capitalism ( as any form of social contract ) needs to serve the people , there is no reason capitalism should be encouraged for it 's own sake . 
  industries are fine if you make the environment predictable and make assets like labor and capital accessible end productive , also because of the aging population the 60-80 's standard of large scale industry and employment is ineffective in the long run , large companies will always prefer and old experienced worker to a new graduate , and retirement is unhealthy psychologically when you have a life expectancy of 80 + years . 
  so a return to '70s welfare is unprovable but your national cohesion does allow you to experiment with new forms of capitalism , and you soulnd take the anglosaxon plutarchy as a model , it 's also unhealthy . 
  i do n't think slashed is the right term , managed and restructured would be my approach . 
  yes it does cause confusion , but its a reminder that social reform or economical liberalism are not new inventions , since history society has changed and ideas for a better life have replaced fear driven conservatism . 
  it also puts me at odds with people who love labels but have n't a clue about the fundamentals behind them , american neocon 's and british libertarians . 
  you have a comprehensive and functioning welfare system that is n't bankrupting the country . 
  ( compared to global modern day tendencies ) you have a social cohesion that makes large scale reform and political compromise for the common good not only possible but quite frequent ( which is unheard of in most non-scandinavian democracies ) i think you pioneered the presence of academia in government . 
  your society is based on principles of solidarity , efficiency , common sense and discipline , which makes for a capitalistic society without the unwanted externalities other countries have . 
  also , i think modern day dutch progressiveness is inspired by the scandinavian model , more danish than swedish but you still wrote the book on modernity with regard to human decency . 
  i go beyond specific modern day labels , what we view as `` modern '' was `` progressive '' liberalism/capitalism 60-70 years ago . 
  defining tendencies as progressive vs conservative allow you to look at history in a unified way . 
  but do n't all progressive things conflict with traditionalism , how come alcohol is limited , but feminism has such a strong support ? 
  how much is overtime paid ? 
  not negesarally in the retail sector, 
  life in the favelas is getting better , i did n't hear anything about a long term development strategy for the welsh . 
  thanks for the insight , are the tax rates and the cost of public services raised by a lot why the upheaval ? 
  yeah , we have those to , they 're called shops ... are there specific advantages ? 
  disclaimer : my economic views are heavily to the right , so a national monopoly on a consumer market is kinda satan 's work from my pov . 
  why is it understandable to not have a 24/7 shop ? 
  is it a social thing or you 're just used to it ? 
  not all of the continent and even saying most , is a sign of ignorance and a massive generalisation . 
  but my main complaint is regarding the third world thing , do n't use the term when you have cities like swansea that are falling apart faster than any south american favela . 
  and about the dea , follow the money not the propaganda . 
  really are there upsides ? 
  i apologize , never been , but from what i understand it 's difficult to find an open shop in the evening . 
  at least we 're not a plutocracy, 
  the article does n't mention that brazil is at a high point of government spending in preparations for next years world cup , this increases gdp nominally with only temporary positive effects within the economy and of course inflatiion . 
  i have nothing bad to say about argentina , but there are suspicions that the actual inflation rate is actually double the 10 % reported , but until official numbers contradict it or debt explodes because of government subsidies it remains a positive example . 
  no , socialist policies are disregarded as populist , as conservative policies are seen as corrupt pro corporate measures . 
  this is how politics works , you need to understand that the government cant pay for the well being of its people indefinitely . 
  ( except for cuba ) . 
  misery and stagnation ? ... wtf the last time i checked we could afford non-industrial food , collage degrees and high speed internet .
