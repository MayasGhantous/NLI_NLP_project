  what if italian catholic build a big green cube as a church would it bother you or your race has the right to redecorate your house because it 's theirs to . 
   you get the bullet to make a better world for the future . 
  you do n't get to make it you are just an a resource used by somebody 's ego , you have no idea what his real intentions are , and he does n't give a shit about what your ideals are , just as long as you go and give 110 % to defend his interests . 
  do you think you care about ideals , in those last moments , you 're sweating , your hyperventilating , other people are screaming and crying around you , you feel your chest heavier and heavier , you struggle for breath , you head is spinning and you just feel tired and dizzy , do you think you even care about being a hero in those last moments before you die ? 
  or lets say you survive but are handicapped emotionally and physically . 
  you 'll be a hero for a couple of weeks maybe even months , but after that , the members of your family will be the heroes for taking care of you and loving a broken mind ... in the meantime the general that sent you gets a boost in rank , gets awarded a medal and is declared a public hero , the politician that started the war is a hero and a visionary if he won , or gets labeled the bad guy if he loses ... but you clearly do n't get it , so long live romantic ideals ... fortza italia , go azzuri and the peninsula rules . 
   screwing me over . 
  again , i do n't ... nobody is forcing you to do anything , you loose nothing ... whatever , purity for all , no diversity here ... and so on . 
  gypsies are native to all of southern europe especially the balcans , our fascists did n't `` clean up '' as well the etnic pool . 
  . . today you learned ... 
  poverty increases crime rates not immigration , immigration minus integration leads to poverty , do some non-racist research . 
  now common ground ...  you want to come here and study ? 
  fine . 
  you 're a doctor ? 
  an engineer ? 
  an architect ? 
  you 're welcome . 
  sadly though the vast majority of immigrants are n't like that . 
  they just exploit the country . 
  i agree the selection and integration of immigrants is abysmal this should be the issue , not the number , but the support they receive to become active citizens . 
   how much of out taxes go to welfare to immigrants actually curious , i doubt welfare generates a relevant deficit in your budget , but i agree that welfare is not the right type of stimulus if your purpose is to integrate them . 
   i do n't want these problems . 
  i do n't want you to have them either , but immigration will happen , the albanians that invaded the se ten years ago where all ilegal , most present day lybians are illegal , it is inevitable , you need zero tolerance for illegal and communication and actual effort to integrate legal immigrants . 
  closing the doors or an limiting communication only gives illegals a reason not to call the authorities when they witness their conational doing something illegal . 
   now , they have taken districts of milan and they are slowly turning them into shit holes just like they did with their former countries . 
  would the police intervene if locals would be doing that ? 
  yes , you have a problem with a politically correct police commissioner that cares more about politics rather than his job no , your police commissioner is incompetent and he has to be changed, 
  ... and the child deserves to die , because he was born in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
  gdp per capita does n't mean shit , its mathematics , you have a large population you have small everything per capita ... look at child education , mortality rates , income disparity and wealth distribution , of course opec countries do n't like to advertise how awful the life of their average citizen is so they rarely publish these numbers . 
  how does a building aggravate you ? 
  that is ridiculous . 
  are you okay with gypsy ghettos or only white ghettos for you ? 
  well you live in a white bubble , most europeans are actually fine with moderate immigration , as seen by election results even in countries where there is a social problem radical parties rarely break 30 % . 
  and that is a percentage of voters . 
  and not everyone votes . 
  i 'm not mad , just making a joke , that you did n't get nobody is forcing you to do anything !, 
  you are free to do whatever you want , move to another country or spot looking at mosques . 
  that is the problem with chauvinists like you , you 're so insecure about you identity that the mere sight of something different makes you doubt it . 
  for heavens sake , a mosque ? 
  seriously ? 
  legacy ? 
  what part of leaders get the glory , ordinary people get bullets you do n't understand ? 
   it 's about fighting for a better future . 
  praise be jesus , mohamed and the rest of the pantheon ... common ground . 
  i totally agree , in this shitty world , and this limited live everyone deserves a fighting chance . 
  my opinion is that you fight wherever you have a better chance . 
  and i 'm guessing in your opinion it 's unfair to change the location of that struggle . 
  right ? 
  i do n't know shit about imigration , but all romanians are experts in passing by and if your unlucky trough ghettos , filled with a marginalised population that resents you . 
  the difference is , that population has citizenship . 
  that population is in charge of almost all organised crime . 
  police either fear them or are in their pocket . 
  i know what happens to a marginalised ethnicity and the reality is that once the honest immigrants give up trying to make an honest living you have a much bigger problems that a fucking building . 
  oh and as long as i threw political correctness out the window , ** understand this ** controlled immigration only works on people that are afraid of the law , and those immigrants are only a problem in the dreams of white privileged assholes . 
   if the indian does n't like it he can get out it 's not that easy of a choice , between letting their children starve and `` slavery '' many will pick the second option . 
   native population of the uae profit from their country and the happiness of others is not their concern my point was that unlike norway where the whole population profits in the uae just the royal family 's inner group profits . 
   it 's not fair that they should come here and impose their rules . 
  they came , they should put up with us . 
  has anybody obligated you to pray to allah ? 
  also why be a bully ? 
  just to prove how much more entitled you are ? 
   i do n't have to put up the majority decides , and people are in general kind towards those less fortunate , but you 're right you do n't have to put up with people that are different than you , you can always move somewhere less tolerant  your actions are what makes history . 
  if you do n't take action , there is no history of you . 
  if you get assimilated by the french it 's like you never existed . 
  are you sure you 're not a jihadist recruiter cause you really sound like one ? 
  history is only a ego stroking story told by winners to future generations , also kings , presidents , and leaders are remembered , but the people that actually fight are just bodies , they are a resource , elements in a statistical sum of bodies . 
  i 'm sorry to spoil it , but we do n't matter . 
  best case scenario you make an impression on those around you and you will be remembered a couple of decades after you die . 
   ... define morality ( for themselfs ) ... if i do something nutty i get locked up by my peers , if they do it , its either the devil testing them or god 's misterious ways . 
  pedophilia is horrible , but evangelism scares me much more , i do n't think the us , brazil , uganda and russia are extreme cases , i thing they are examples for things to come , as moderates join the ranks of humanists and agnostics , the remainder of believers are radical and disturbed people , that will push one another to more and more intolerance . 
  in both cases we are dealing with a tight hierarchical system where loyalty trumps morality . 
  if you throw out one of your own , you will be marginalised by the rest of the system , also it does n't help that they get to define morality . 
   i 'm going to distrust mosques i encourage you to , also keep an eye on our own religion . 
  distrust for people that have imaginary friends is always healthy . 
  you can not blame a belief system or ideas , that is equivalent to saying only my ideas have value and you become as dogmatic as the ones you condemn , someday a nutjobs is empowered by `` your truth '' and starts killing christians because they do n't accept the one and only `` truth '' . 
  actions need to be condemned and to address your second point most muslims do condemn violence , and nobody feels more shame and fear after islamic attack than a muslim living in the west . 
  in what way do the historical differences ( before 1800 ) have an effect on modern day productivity ? 
  how come they do n't effect germany , the netherlands and denmark they had widely different historical contexts but they turned out similar , not culturally but socioeconomically . 
   people even look different wait , what ? 
  so is it an insult , if a say to a sicilian : you look venetian ? 
  or the other way around ? 
  all liberation movements succeed , only if there is a beneficial context . 
  my trade argument was that a nation , ca n't just decide it does n't want to be poor ; it needs help , any most of the time , it does n't get it . 
  ferraris do n't tell you how rich a country is , it tells you how rich a countries elites are . 
  norwegians have profited a lot more from their countries resources than citizens of the uae . 
  i guarantee you an indian ( because they do most of the work in the uae ) works even harder that a norwegian , but he ca n't catch a break because , his employer wants another ferrari . 
   i 'm doing well enough without them very true , you absolutely do n't ** need ** it is just a nice political measure which you can oppose because you have the right to have a divergent opinion then your goverment , unlike a lot of immigrants . 
   they are a burden to society if by culture you mean established demographic status quo , then yes , they are quite disruptive , but so is time and you are n't going to be able to stop that anyway . 
  society changes , it 's inevitable , you can oppose and fill up with hate and resentment that you neighbours are different than yourself , or you can embrace the good and fight the bad with the rest of us . 
  they did n't care , they paid their dues to the bourbon family as easy as they paid the medici 's . 
  you are a person , you are defined by your actions not your history . 
   if you just get assimilated because you do n't care about who rules you , you better kill yourself because it 's like you never existed . 
  kinda sounds like the type of thing a jihadist recruiter would say to an unemployed muslim immigrant . 
  in what way ? 
  syracuse was a greek center of culture , naples was the envy of all of medieval europe . 
  there are no historical differences so powerful that their influence spans for more than a century . 
  nobody cared about us until the fall of the soviet union , we where lost to communism . 
  the us was busy preventing other nations turning red to care about us . 
  poland , the czech republic and hungary are proof , all of their attempts at liberty where squashed because nobody cared . 
  belarus , georgia and n korea are modern examples ... there is no difference between a man born in venice or vladivostock ... despite being condemned from the start with very different chances at a fulfilled life .
