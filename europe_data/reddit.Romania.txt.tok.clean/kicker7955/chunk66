  this really is n't subredditdrama worthy , but nice try what 's the world coming to , if you ca n't express your ideas in a faux argument with a underage american overweight flamer ( calm down - the internet kind ), 
  i see reddit as very leftist . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  my point was [ asshole comments creates the need for more mod arbitrations ] ( http://youtu.be/zcaaertdaqk?t=43s ) also , i 'm sick of umbrella terms ... immigration policies are not about left-right politics , its about humanism vs nationalism , some people think your place of birth does n't need to define your opportunities in live in an era of mobility and globalism and others think that you should do the most with the cards you have been dealt . 
  both sides are right from they 're ideological point of view . 
  mixing in social / economic measures just dilutes right wing economics , which is scarce and mutilated as it is , in modern european politics . 
  now if i downvote you , for being an asshole , liberals are going to complain about downvote culture and ask the mods for changes , and i do n't like changes ; see what a predicament you caused , i feel like the european commission , caught between cheap gas and pity for the ukrainian people . 
  those are n't arguments for a ban or restrictions, 
  yes , actually it 's quite probable imo ; but first 1 . a. the political structure of the eu needs to change , so that the actual decision power remains west of the oder ( river , poland ) b. russia needs to accept this as non-negotiable 2 . 
  russia has to reach a level that cheap german/british technology and financing , becomes essential to international competitiveness . 
  western companies need to see that russian resources are essential for international competitiveness . 
  4 . european and russian oligarchs need to work together 5 . russia needs to clean up its image for 5-7 years when it comes to human rights , corruption and international policy ( free ukraine for starters ), 
  what does this accomplish ? 
  also considering the majority of people who votes for this , it will probably be a a competition between obama ( for the 3rd time , for healthcare and iran , this time ) and the pope ( because he is cool and trendy and a pope ), 
  actually russia created the `` moldavian '' autonomous region ( basis of present transnistrea ) from ukraine in a propaganda campaign . 
  ( buffer zone from further romanian expansion ) . 
  latter when russia got bessarabia ( eastern moldova ) they glued 6 counties from that autonomous region to the occupied territory and by the magic of bolshevik bureaucracy the present republic of moldavia was born , well not as much born , as conceptualized , cause the actual birth was 50 years later when the soviet republic declared its independence . 
  russian administration is a clusterfuck of propaganda , cultural legacy , historical serendipity and military strategy . 
  it 's quite a fun read . 
  a confederation is difficult also from an economic point of view . 
   it would be suicide for a politician to argue in support of the loss of the region nationalism - cock blocking common-sense since 1789 is transnistria a political topic ? 
  are solutions discussed ? 
   it 's unstable from the moldovan/western pov . 
  i do n't think russia views it as `` unstable '' . 
  for russia it 's firmly stable and they are in control there . 
  and as such they can poke at chisinau . 
  i do n't know strategically i really do n't see the downside , i think the eastern argument is more emotional in nature , somewhat along the lines of : that former ussr territory is under `` american '' influence now ( kinda like south vietnam for the us , or a gagauz republic from chisinaus side )  but most people who advocate a separation do so on the de jure border , which is the river . 
  de facto separation being somewhat different , it creates some complications for the process . 
  true , borders are weird and random , probably because they 're made by ~ ~ people ~ ~ ( egos ) . 
  it 's still is a medieval practice . 
  i would be more concerned with what the people would think about being ** given ** away , 18th century style . 
   russia 's interest is not to create a new state , but to maintain the situation a grey area . 
  separating transnistria from moldova proper means russia lost a foothold over moldova  transnistrian elites probably profit from the grey legal area they are in . 
  smuggling is probably quite lucrative . 
  both are seen as `` good guys '' only because there is oppressive bad guy , remove the `` bad guy '' and they 're propaganda falls flat . 
  also , russia and the elites can do little to sway public opinion 180 degrees in a small time frame . 
  + i think russia cares more about having an avantgarde outpost for it 's army . 
  so a stable outpost would be prefarable to an unstable one  certain areas of transnistria are under chisinau 's control - dubasari area - , and some `` moldova proper '' areas are under transnistrian control - namely bender/tighina . 
  see map [ 1 ] . 
  i doubt transnitria wants to let go of bender/tighina . 
  i 'm not advocating the border should be the river . 
  trans nistrea as a province is an artificial construct anyway . 
   a third of transnistrians are romanian-speakers . 
  chisinau is probably hesitant to let them go . 
  30 % of montenegrins are serbs , so it might work  it might give the gagauz ideas if the population is convinced that independence is the best course of action , then self-governance should always be an available option . 
  ( i 'm not magyar , just a person that hates nationalism ), 
  it 's more of a psychological conflict . 
  people that embrace russification where favored by the communist regime , this gave them standing , prestige and encouraged them to live the socialist propaganda . 
  as part of a socialist republic , moldavians where raised up as citizens of a superpower that was the pinnacle of middle xx ` th century technology , industry and society ( that is another debate ) . 
  so when the ussr broke up they ended up loosing they superpower identity and a shattered ego . 
  so unpopular opinion time : why is n't transnistrea an independent state yet ? 
  it seems a less complicated case than kosovo , and it would streamline moldovian politics a lot . 
  ( picture the skeptical african kid meme ) so you 're telling me that if you 're young and want to move to the capital the state gives you affordable housing just because you ask for it ? 
  but you have to wait 5-8 years ( most of witch you live on campus i imagine ) now seriously that is a great system , yes it can be better but think of the brain drain the rest of the country goes trough if the time frame would be 6 months . 
  but i guess societal tinkering takes a back seat to individual wishes . 
  that 's why i like you nordics , you made the state your bitch . 
  well switching to the euro is further along the road , and maybe not even be an option . 
  there will be economic growing pains but mostly because of an uncompetitive workforce and inefficient local companies , both of which can be neutralize by it 's bigger neighbours ( romania & ukraine ) . 
  however i doubt that the eu activists care about that , people need hope more than anything , they protest for better jobs , better life and a better future not for them but for their kids . 
  these are people that forgot communism and how much better a state run democracy and limping capitalism is . 
  they are now comparing what they have with us and saying i will not be satisfied with the life my government is alowing me to have , i want better , i deserve better . 
  ( now if you are aware of the geopolitical context feel free to replace `` my government '' with `` russian empire '' also i feel this is the case with ukraine to , which is a much more difficult case , in the worst case scenario moldova is small enough so that eu funds can accelerate its economy to a level that the population will barely feel the economic transition , but ukcraine , is huge and this will not be a solution ), 
  from what i understand middle class and under 35 favors the eu , when 70k people protest in a city of 800k your gathering is much more significant that just a student movement . 
  so the eu is more popular among middle class educated city residents . 
  but what to do with the rural communities and the separatists ? 
  unless russia gives the ok i doubt moldova and the ukraine have any real chance , however 20 years ago the same could be said for romania , so good luck . 
  are you actually comparing georgia/iraq with the situation in mali ? 
  also some people are n't rich enough to make ideological judgements from your position of privilege . 
  you scandinavians are so cute with your functional government and responsible bureaucrats . 
  the us is a police state , but deciding what media should people consume is totalitarian . 
  but talk like this is bad for karma in a predominantly anglo-saxon internet/website so i abstain from further comment . 
  possession of undesirable media punished with jail time ... sounds about right for english style `` democracy '', 
  france 24/dw essentially ; but i do mix it up with some bbc and better judgement, 
  so basically what you 're saying is that if the name implies a political bias it probably exists ? 
  it 's more about being able to decide for yourself what is good , what is wrong and what you want and living according to your own best judgement . 
  of course all this within limits as to not encroach on other peoples rights . 
  this is significantly better than when the ** state ** , dilutes your identity , dictates how you should live and oversees every move you make , every conversation you have and every decision you take in an attempt to protect itself . 
  ( yes it sounds similar to what democratic governments are promoting as safety measures against terrorism ), 
  6 in 10 is still pretty good , when the lack of interest prevents referendum validation , you can complain . 
  my problem with television stations stems from my personal experience with chanels from my country . 
  our parties have little to no ideological stance on anything , except getting the votes and the public cash . 
  and as a result you can see journalists changing stances from one week to another . 
  the only opinion leaders that do n't do this are `` the loud mouths '' the late night '' glenn becks '' that have `` pure ideologies '' . 
  now romania is lucky because they mostly preach disgust and elitism and only moderate racism and homophobia but they 're influence is massive nonetheless . 
  now if you replace these buffoons with radicals that actually have an agenda you have a propaganda machine that ceaucescu would be proud of . 
   comfirmation biais on the other hand play a heavy role on the agressive stance of far left and far right that you can ever seen on reedit sometime . 
  i ever stumbled upon a far left instruction on how to manipulate public boards , infiltrate moderation position and promote their agenda . 
  this is why i advocate for education , we are teaching people to fish in a world where people throw fish at you , let 's teach them filtering and quality control . 
   journalism ... was always shitty , even before television , you had poor quality and biggoted newspaper of all tendancies . 
  yes but you had variety , which you do n't get now , you got a nationalist a socialist and an anarchist writing editorials in the same newspaper , now you get entire media empires with a single ideology . 
   le monde , first newspaper in france , lose as much in a year than the whole bfm 24hour channel budget . 
  that accountant should be fired . 
  but i 'm comparing historical costs , a century ago you published a newspaper with your union 's spare change , now national television channels are barely managing to stay open . 
  ( except for the bbc ) . 
  i feel the internet has another inherent fault , it is defined by confirmation bias , because all of the worlds information is available with little filter you are naturally attracted to sources that share or complement your opinions . 
  imagine if children would be allowed to define their education , well guess what ... that 's the internet with the added bonus that is virality as an `` exceptional '' story is exponentially more ( socially ) valuable than a well documented one . 
  you can look at this in an absolute way , but because television is expensive to produce , and its distribution is limited by a small number of cable providers , you get large media companies that are powerful enough to limit actual information . 
  on the other hand , tv is drowning in its own irrelevance and anticompetitive practices , which makes journalistic integrity a commodity that will be sold to the highest bidder . 
  how about a `` travel to ... '' series each week a destination , city or region , with tips/costs/hot-spots and maybe even some insider knowledge from the locals . 
  kill 24 hour news channels and increase transparency of political financing ... also education ... civic education is abysmal in my country so most people gravitate towards extremism for answers .
