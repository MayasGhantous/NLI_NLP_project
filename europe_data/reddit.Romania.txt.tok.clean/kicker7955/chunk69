  more political exploitation by the president . 
  and a lot of web traffic made by protesters in this circlejerk of a blogosphere . 
  the law was nullified by the court , so how are businesses not allowed to develop ? 
  i understand your point of view , but how is government being government like we would expect any reason to protest the mining development ? 
  by this logic we should stop all industry developments and keep the countryside , green and wild ( despite 50 % of the population lives there in medieval grade poverty ) . 
  our government just passed a law that makes selling agricultural land almost impossible to any foreign investors or young entrepreneurs , that does n't make you cringe ? 
  that does n't make you get out and protest ? 
  last week the privatisation of cfr marfa passed , it just created a monopoly on all land freight transport in this part of europe , but that 's fine since we still have somewhere where we can enjoy the illusion of ecotourism 3-4 times a year . 
  are the hungarians guilty for the [ ajka accident ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajka_alumina_plant_accident ) accidents happen on modern chemical mining exploitations , are you arguing to stop all mining because there is a couple of accidents per decade ? 
  also , how is deforestation relevant for safety regulations ? 
  actually any development needs to adhere to eu regulations which i suppose you trust , and on safety regulations our government is not as incompetent as in other fields ( they like the money they get from fines ) . 
  the region 's largest city is abrud , witch has a population of about 3000 and the rest are sparsely populated mountain villages . 
  thank you , not actually my intention but it happens . 
  care to explain what particularly moved your breakfast `` over the edge '' ? 
   so no businesses are given any permit , where did you hear this ? 
   tried the best to keep the locals poor and unemployed considering how many poor , mismanaged counties we have , i find it hard to believe that this is a result of malevolence rather than basic incompetence . 
  if your concern would be realistic , i seriously doubt cyanide would be the norm in gold mining , or we would simply stop mining gold altogether . 
  this is n't any different than any other australian or canadian gold mine . 
  but in this particular case the locals want it , the country favors it and a couple of thousand freeloaders who believe nature is more important than food because they never felt hunger do n't want it . 
  i am , personally , offended every day by what 3/4 of the worlds population does because of religion , but that does n't give me the right to berate their leaders and gather signatures against them . 
  and what angers me most is that despite all the stupid and corrupt shit my government has done , only in the last 3 years , this is what made people get of their ass to protest , talk about success of propaganda . 
  the `` green villagers '' argue that the romanian people have been brain washed to agree with the project , but what they do n't say is that public advertising has been allowed only in the last 2 years * for * the project , but anti-rosia montana stickers and indie festivals have been `` promoting '' opposition for more than 10 years . 
  i have a hard time understanding why it 's the whole country 's business , but how in the world is it the whole internet 's business ? 
  i agree , but if the finnish government will make a move it will be on a emotional level , maybe get together a group of finnish investors put together a holding company give some state guarantees for loans , it does n't have to be a direct purchase . 
  i do n't really see nokia dying , but i also do n't see apple going the distance so i 'm probably not the voice of reason here . 
   steam engine and internal combustion engine are the same cause they both use fossil fuels . 
  and pistons, 
  i say have a referendum ( we 're experts by now ) , and when the project passes let 's protest the referendum , cause yeah , what spells democracy more than a couple of thousand well of people deciding what an entire country should do . 
  ( in case you missed it i was comparing our confused , but idealist protesters with our corrupt and incompetent political class ) . 
  second op for the italian fratelli d'italia , it 's just so italian : loud , proud and upbeat . 
  thanks op , til about / r/vexillology and / r/paradoxplaza, 
  it 's a movie , a blockbuster , it 's not designed to make you think more complex ideas that boom-boom pacpacpac . 
  i assure you , the director can make something thought provoking , but not with a large budget . 
  the thing you should not forget is that these types of movies are made to bring the masses to the cinema , masses do n't like to think , at best they like to pretend they think . 
  an actual moving , thought provoking movie would n't be fun for `` mass viewing '' in a imax 3d cinema . 
  it would loose money , and the director would be blacklisted as not a `` top tier '' name that can bring the audience to the cinema . 
  and art aside he ca n't afford that . 
  want to critique something ? 
  it 's oscar season , the next months are going to be filled with pseudo art/drama/profound movies , at least 4 or 5 will try to argue that slavery was bad , and there is one about the holocaust and reading i think . 
  i do n't want to be pretentious , but we should enjoy movies as the cultural fast food they are and stop this cultural jerking , it only lowers expectations for truly great stories with real emotion or dept. 
  considering they did n't take the nokia brand name away , i think both ms and nokia are sceptical wp will succeed , after microsoft gets bored or tired of trying to be apple , they will sell nokia to anyone who cares , probably the finish government , we europeans are sentimental like than . 
  why do n't we do this ? 
  sweden takes our whites , we take their blacks everybody is happy . 
  beer , you guys made it into an art form . 
  man bites dog is a great movie . 
  and there is a * small * music festival called neverland that looks nice . 
  istanbul , they have more money to spend than spain and tokyo is not in europe . 
  ( it 's not on the elementary school map of europe . ), 
  do n't know very much but apparently they have amazing value on their internet contracts  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lk3ky/reurope_internet_speed_survey/cc05zrl from / u/despruk latvia [ baltcom ] ( http://www.baltcom.lv/lv/baltcom/internets/piedavajums-un-cenas/ ) ** 250/250 mbit/s ** 9,10 ls 13.06 $ a friend of mine has this , but max speed they offer : 500/500 mbit/s 35 ls 50.24 $, 
  timisoara always gets the coolest shit . 
  i agree that i am maybe ideologically biased , but i think of myself as more of a realist than other reformers , and am more progressive compared to the academic standard of our age . 
  since we seem to agree that the `` macroeconomic guru '' was full of fairy tales let me present my main point and then respond to your points . 
  i do not think this is a good ( stable in the long term ) and efficient system ( of distribution of money trough the economy ) , but it can work , if proper supervision and legislation is adopted . 
  this i find to be a more realistic and obtainable goal , that enforcing an economic y2k . 
  i did mention that the profit incentives work for commercial activities not capital management . 
  i agree that the banks control the flow of capital , and this is a problem , but having no filters , only a political-administrative entity is not a solution either . 
  using our current framework , defining the ways capital can be used and letting financial operators fail ( this makes the banks stock owners limit the risk they will tolerate from their ceo 's in the future ) is a far better and more tangible solution . 
  i am arguing direct political influence over an economical tool will do exponentially more damage than simple greed , for better or worst bankers know and work with the system ; their abuse is applied in such a way that they can reap benefits even in 5-10 years from now , politicians have neither the expertise nor the self-control to think long-term . 
  can you see a politician saying to his electorate : we will keep interest rates high because it is a difficult economical climate and be reelected ? 
  look at the germans , despite their rational and long term thinking , they are angry with the stagnation of their economy despite it being the most structurally solid in the world . 
  imagine a politician running for office that has the power to improve the economy over night . 
  my apology , i took some liberties when i said non-keynesian , but the fact is the last 40 years of growth in the uk and the us ( to a lesser degree , their economy has other engines ) has been based on overcapitalization of companies , national investments and preferential corporate legislation . 
  and because of this , i define them as pure keynesian economies . 
  a non keynesian economy is one , in witch banking is restricted to commercial activities and investment banking are mostly separated . 
  highly leveraged transactions are prohibited , anti-trust laws work , and in general the bulk of gdp comes from the `` real '' economy . 
  and monetary mass is controlled and limited by central banks . 
  the framework works well in most western economies ( this recession only affected solid economies by proxy ) , people following their self interest is a good way of maximising productivity , having good laws and applying them to limit risk makes for a safer system than bureaucrats that will still follow their self interest , but this time they wo n't be under the supervision of somebody that can act quickly to stop their abuse . 
  actually no , that is the premise of basic inflation , i was referring to a backhand consequence of the [ price/wage spiral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price/wage_spiral ) . 
  in a stagnant economy worker 's expectations grow , this causes increased spending which lowers their effective real income this is equivalent to the effect of inflation . 
  i am just saying that change has never occurred suddenly , it has always been gradual , and in modern history power has been constantly decentralised not concentrated . 
  and within these limits we have to find the solution . 
  yes , i am not talking about exchange ratios , i am talking about internal value , a low purchasing power of production assets makes all production expensive ; this is the main reason that nigeria ca n't produce at a reasonable cost to compete with romanian exporters , even if it has lower labor costs and why the us is able to compete with china even if labor is more expensive . 
  internal demand is in general subsidised by the state in these cases , and so almost all manufacturers stop exporting because they want to have bigger margins . 
  but ( unless the state intervenes ) imports continue and this not only creates external debt but also ruins the exchange ratio as importers buy up all the foreign currency and try to sell excess national currency ; this blows up your exchange ratio ( unless the state intervenes again ) which causes all imports to become more expensive and national debt grows exponentially . 
  and positive money seems to be left wing idealism without substance and pragmatical solutions : - `` liability money '' is restricted in most countries by banking legislation , banks have to guarantee most of their crediting with deposits ( central reserves ) to the national bank , the problem lies in the british government letting the banks have only 3 % of their liability covered by actual money , not with the system ( in this case ) 1 . so working with central issued liabilities that are unsupervised is somehow better than working with private liabilities . 
  spreading of `` the wealth '' on a number of private banks means that they can theoretically fail and the economy will survive ( if this does n't happen is the government fault and should be addressed as that ) . 
  also private banks are motivated by profit and this , in the commercial sector is a good thing , it creates a higher cost for risky ( or ineffective ) investments and rewards safe stable investment ( i said commercial not financial sector , there the profit rates and the possibility of covering risk makes the situation basically reversed , you 're a fool if you invest in low yielding stocks , ) . 
  he very well stated that the committee should be protected from lobbyists and government but should be fully transparent and under parliamentary scrutiny !, 
  how does that work ? 
  if the government will have a monopoly in crediting business and citizens i assure you they will not be reluctant in doing so , the main cause of the 3 % coverage rate is because the government wanted perpetual high growth ( again the problem is administrative ) and did not care about the risk ( or at best , they pushed the risk on to the next guy in office ) . 
  3 . this is basically what happens in non-keynesian economies , germany is the perfect example , but most of europe works the same way and the mechanism is the central bank 's interest rate . 
  again the mechanism exists and works well ( there are some technical problems but that is another story and is more a question of philosophy ) under the current system , when you do n't have greedy politicians and bankers at the economical dashboard . 
  + the inflationary effect is not only related to money mass it is also psychological ( japan , germany ) , the expectancy of growth generates a natural inflation rate as people tend to spend more even when the economy actually stagnates for a long period of time , witch in turn actually makes them poorer . 
  well this point is wtf ? ... so he is arguing the state create money ( a lot of it ) to pays the present debt , and somehow this wont create a excess in the economy and generate inflation that he argued against in the previous point . 
  valid point , but the housing sector is part of the real economy ( the liability part is when you create a artificial rise in housing costs because of increased demand in a inflationary sector ) , however , this can be done in the current system if politicians would learn to say `` no , this is how we 're doing things from now on . '', 
  i do n't care anymore , i 'm to depressed what a pathetic excuse for a economy theory , i do n't know what angers me more , the fact that he makes money selling books with this story telling or that there are actual rational people that take him serious and move away from true progressive and pragmatical solutions . 
  *** tl ; dr ** i find the theory lacking any practical substance , also i apologise for the rant but this really presses my buttons , i feel like the doctor that watched a seventeen century `` healing '' ceremony *, 
  not really if you look at it from a macroeconomic perspective , debt free money makes the actual value of money plummet witch as a side effect means exports will drop resulting in a maybe even higher deficit the country will be in debt for products this time instead of money . 
  oh hungary , you try to do the right thing and go overboard again ... you so silly . 
  any accent ( regional ) in particular ? 
  really , only one portuguese reference !? 
  it 's the language of sirens ( i imagine if they existed ) , all those soft j 's and s'ses ; it sounds like waves smashing against the shore on a quiet night . 
  2 packs a day will fix that right up, 
  is it a patriotic thing or do you actually like something specific about it ? 
  first i heard about it from [ vice documentary ] ( http://www.vice.com/en_uk/vice-news/sisa-cocaine-of-the-poor-part-1 ) , then i talked to a athenian that lives in bucharest and he confirmed that both extremism and drugs are a genuine problem . 
  i am not an expert as most of my information is hear-say or ( sensationalist ) news reports , but from what i understand after the synthetic drug craze in 2010 this particular synthetic stimulant became extremely popular because of its low price and availability . 
  historically greece has had extremist political factions continuously for the last 50 years despite being a democracy and being in general quite well of economically . 
  of course there are contextual causes both for the cold war communists and the anti globalist golden dawn but still i find it quite interesting . 
  firstly i 'm not your granfather , secondly i may be wrong ( this thread is called `` what do you know about ... '' not `` what undeniable facts that can you prove about ... '' ) , thirdly you may be wrong [ ( !,
