the 10 downing street website for instance : [ here . 
  ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20100416083521/http://www.number10.gov.uk/page823 ) or really any governmental site confirms it . 
  it 's always the fault of the english . 
  not everywhere , but political consciousness is strong in scotland . 
  it 's especially evident to me as a romanian to witness the contrast between the two countries ' political discourse . 
  night and day . 
  exactly . 
  they were promised some more decision-making powers especially with regards to the budget . 
  so far , these have yet to be fulfilled , which is why there 's talk of another referendum so soon . 
  did you just say scotland is third-world ? 
  scotland is not a region , it 's a country . 
  the uk is officially referred to as a `` country of countries '' . 
  it should also be noted that they have a parliament and print their own pound sterlings . 
  damn shame my local aldi is an hour walk away . 
  at least i have my trusty lidl , which is always jam-packed with people and amazing prices . 
  i understand not getting teddy bears , but no priests ?!? 
  where is this god-forsaken land that you come from ? 
  sign me up as well . 
  university of edinburgh . 
  friends in glasgow and aberdeen share a similar experience as well , so i 'd say it 's definitely nationwide . 
  that is exactly my experience in a scottish uni currently . 
  i 'm blown away by the amount of people that think this is what universities are supposed to be like . 
  nah do n't worry , they wo n't get anywhere near the seats required for a majority . 
  there 's a good chance tsipras will win the reelection anyways . 
  you and me , bro . 
   notch is sad why ? 
  romania joined in 2007 , and i can tell you from first hand experience that it was a huge net positive , and most romanians ( considering the polls ) agree . 
  that 's possibly the most retarded thing i 've read on / r/europe in a long time . 
  that 's very much wishful thinking . 
   if romania has bad tv licensing laws coupled with an inability to produce content for the romanian market so ? 
  why is n't american and european content good enough ? 
  romanians could n't care less about such things . 
   the latter of whom generally do n't commit violent crime . 
  people like you are what 's wrong with the world . 
  this is the exact rhetoric i 'm faced with daily in hungary and romania . 
  the stupidity hurts . 
   only christian country there they are majority muslim , secular country . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  please tell me no more 2008 style crash . 
  pretty fucking please . 
  i just found out that 1d have split up on a reddit page about european stock indexes . 
  truly we live in the future . 
  ah , now i understand what he meant . 
  thank you , that was informative . 
  uh , what ? 
  should i buy oil barrels ? 
  it 's probably never going to be as low again ... 
  aww ... 
   no right-wing party sits in the parliament in germany uuuh , what ? 
  what is the cdu then ? 
  i mean the hint is in the name ** christian democrat ** union . 
  they are possibly the most typical conservative party in europe ... 
  finland 's down as well . 
  you 're not a proper hipster in romania these days if you do n't drink it . 
  i 'll have ya know mate , people have been deported for less . 
  that ... was painful . 
  oh look at me , i 'm a frenchman , no way i 'm biased . 
  yeah , after their attitude with regards to greece , fuck them . 
  austerity , baby !, 
  had no idea about the anthem . 
  thanks . 
  i 've never heard `` coad\u0103 de maimu\u021b\u0103 '' in my life . 
  a-rond often . 
  really ? 
  i thought they were making fun of the animal every time i heard that haha . 
  well i 'm sure there 's ** someone ** , right ? 
  like three people at least , haha . 
  i do n't get it . 
  why ? 
  why not make a concentrated effort to secure the outer eu border ? 
  anybody 's guess , considering that those two countries , especially poland , are n't slowing down in growth either . 
  too late . 
  renault already snatched it up . 
  but you do n't know the european consensus . 
  you do n't even live here , or do you ? 
  do n't tell us how ** we ** see the world , that 's just next level arrogance . 
  unless you 've spent significant amounts of time in europe , i just have to disagree with you , mate . 
   especially japan then you have no fucking clue . 
  i constantly hear about japanese superiority in technology and efficiency in many very different social groups and countries in europe . 
  i think we have a deep-rooted respect for them , whether that still applies to the japan of the 21st century is debatable , but that is absolutely , 100 % , the perception . 
  what 's with you and latin ? 
  are you mocking dclauzel ? 
  cluj is mini-bucharest anyway . 
  to all these people saying we 're oh so different : go live in china or japan , then come back and tell me how you feel about that . 
   i think ** everybody ** has a desire for peace oh mate , where do you live ? 
  thankfully . 
  however , hammond saying that he 's on top of the calais crisis , just to get shut down by cameron a few days later ( who is on holiday btw ) does n't really inspire confidence either . 
  still , i 'll grant you that corbyn is way off the mark here . 
  you serious ? 
  every time theresa may or boris johnson open their mouths i get an aneurysm . 
  i fear for my health , really ... 
  now i know how to respond to my mother  . <, 
  what ? 
   it 's called `` subway '' in english , not `` metro '' . 
  you shut your dirty ` murican mouth . 
   bucharest - beautiful city ... okay ... 
  hungary would love it , i 'm sure . 
  yeah , which he then taxes . 
  it 's a very loud very small minority , mostly politicians who capitalise on tensions during elections . 
  i can say there really are two kinds of romanians : those that have actually lived in formerly hungarian territories ( think szeklerland and nw transylvania ) and those from moldova and walachia , who have only heard in the news about these mythical hungarians that want to steal their precious country .
