  thanks a bunch !, 
  the danish on this subreddit have no sense of humour . 
  i know this is 15 days late , but oh my god , these are amazing and i miss them so much :( you do n't happen to know of any decent recipes online ? 
  it looks similar to the finnish word ` perse ' ? 
  idk , i do n't get it either . 
  yep , it means `` sure '' . 
  such obvious bullshit hurts , my friend . 
  first you link a picture showing eurozone gdp and then talk about the eu as a whole . 
  let me illuminate you : the eu single market has a higher nominal gdp than the us . 
  proof : [ united nations statistics division ] ( http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/dnllist.asp ), 
  yeah dude , i ca n't wait to hear more of the usual political whining . 
  the fucking cows were cute , at least . 
  i 'll take practically anyone but the first two . 
  i do , yes . 
  i also understand that accelerationism does not work . 
  therefore i will take the neoliberal before the fascist any day of the week . 
  when fascism is the alternative , yes , i like macron . 
  do actually i like neoliberalism ? 
  fuck no . 
  well great , he 's perfect then . 
  i do n't even want to know more , i 'm sold . 
  and do you believe such a feeling just pops into existence ? 
  you have to make it happen . 
  on this issue ( and others ) , the public is uninformed and misinformed . 
  if the only thing we did was what `` the public '' wanted we 'd all still be living in mud huts in africa . 
  86 % upvoted , yet most of the comments here are cancer . 
  people want us to fail so badly . 
  wonder why, 
  this is my final reply , i 'm not going to debate anymore . 
  you make huge claims , and the only evidence you 've shown so far is : `` trust me , i work in some unspecified place where uk postgrads do badly , therefore i 'm right and you 're wrong . '', 
  sample size ? 
  selection bias ? 
  argument from authority ? 
  jesus man , and you pretend to be a postgrad in stem ? 
  if you qualified than we are doomed . 
  why are you purposefully ignoring everything else i wrote ? 
  we were initially talking about how choosing ranking criteria evidently biases the results . 
  unless you disagree with that statement , who cares who has more universities in that stupid list ? 
  it might as well have ended at the top 10 , in which case only american and english universities would have made the top bracket . 
  you 're moving the goalposts and you know it . 
   academia is all about connections , building networks in order to exchange ideas first of all , you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  second of all , it 's about that , but not limited to that . 
  it 's also not limited to just teaching . 
  for example , it 's also about instilling the ability of self-education , a skill which is woefully lacking in most people today . 
   that supposed to be much in stem ? 
  where i did my degree not a single person out of 100 finished in minimum time . 
  50 % had dropped the course before the first year was done . 
  seriously ? 
  ** that ** is your definition of a better system ?!, 
  the point is n't to create the best dick-measuring contests , the point is to have well-educated people who can either contribute further to scientific progress or enter the workforce well-prepared . 
  if the uk can do that without having to fail most of the class every year , then you just proved my point : they deserve their place in these rankings . 
   fields medals . 
   or how about we do it the other way round . 
  nobel prizes by institute of graduation so we can test teaching too . 
  i 'll also wait  out of the two ( fields and nobel ) , which one do you think is more prestigious ? 
  i 'll challenge you to find a single person that does n't work in academia and still knows what a fields medal is . 
  you also missed my point completely . 
  it 's undeniable that france ( or germany etc. ), 
  has amazing teaching institutions in maths and stem in general . 
  it 's also undeniable that teaching in france and the uk differs , therefore the rankings which were optimised for one style of academia are biased in favour of it . 
  shocking , i know . 
  of course it is . 
  which is why i was saying that those rankings target an audience that does n't necessarily see the situation this way . 
  at least , it 's true for my particular uni ( and it took a while to get used to , for sure ) . 
  bruh , i did it in first year , but sure , believe your fairytales . 
  they literally have to kick out the bottom 15 % every year in my degree because of the huge application rate . 
  and they make it known the moment you step into the building that a bit less than half the class wo n't make it to fourth year . 
  but ok , sure , you know better than i do , haha . 
  the scottish government . 
  sorry , but your second paragraph is just ridiculous . 
  i wo n't even bother to respond if you 're not able to acknowledge the nuance in this discussion . 
  i for one attend one of these universities in the uk and , so far , am # 0 in debt , considering that my tuition is paid for by the government . 
  unless they use some innovative teaching techniques that i 'm not aware of in germany , the quality of education is going to be extremely similar regardless of where you go . 
  therefore the reputation and research avaliability and quality become measures of significant importance . 
  academia = / = preparing people for future jobs , there 's much more to it than that . 
  universities are not some factories that churn out semi-conscious beings capable of entering the workforce and nothing else . 
  academia is much , much more than that , and if you ca n't appreciate that point , it 's probably better that you did n't come to a uk university . 
  they are biased in favour of anglo-american unis , but only because of the way those universities are structured , as opposed to the way most european universities are : they favour research just as much or even more than teaching quality , something many elite teaching institutions in france , for instance , do n't do . 
  but this is exactly what they ** should ** be doing . 
  these are english-language rankings made for a specific audience . 
  if they chose any other ranking type , they would be biased in favour of other types of institutions , which would n't necessarily be a useful measure for their intended audience . 
  how is refugee policy not a social issue ? 
  it obviously has economic implications , but so does every other policy ever . 
  no offense , but you ca n't talk about those cause people both on the right and on the actual left ( not neoliberals ) know those topics are a bullshit distraction . 
  what has bourgeois feminism achieved in the past decade ? 
  more women ceos , yay !, 
  yeah , but think about what the next 4 years mean . 
  we need schulz sooner rather than later . 
  are iceland and ukraine part of the eu ? 
  there 's your answer . 
  sure i get that , but how can you include poland and hungary and not slovakia then ? 
  or the netherlands and denmark , who 've also traditionally been very eurosceptic . 
  who 's the second rogue state ? 
  you and me , buddy . 
  i usually make every effort to get tripe soup whenever i visit romania , it 's like the best thing ever . 
  absolutely amazing if prepared well . 
  also sour-dough soup and horse steaks ? 
  what 's wrong with either of those ? 
  yay, 
   renault logan it 's surprising to me that it 's not called a dacia in russia .
