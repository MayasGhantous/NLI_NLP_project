  this bulgarian envy is bringing down the balkans . . you assimilated all your vlachs and now you envy ours . . 
   hardly this is original aromanian music the video you provided does not seem to prove anything . 
  i do n't see any relationship with what i posted . 
  if you know music which is related to what i posted , provide a link please . 
   also the dance `` horo '' is popular all over the balkans . 
  good . 
  i would love to see other communities performing this dance . 
  please provide a link . 
  thanks  the largest community of aromanians lives in romania . 
  actually the largest community of aromanians is probably still living in greece but greece does not recognize them as an ethnic minority and many aromanians do n't speak the language or do n't identify as aromanians anymore so it 's hard to count them . 
  for more than 1000 years there is a continuous process of assimilation all over balkans and many aromanians have adopted the language and/or identity of their countrymen . 
  the aromanians are a latin-speaking ethnic group native to the southern balkans ; traditionally living in northern and central greece , albania , the republic of macedonia , and south-western bulgaria . 
  i 'm glad you liked it . 
  here 's something slightly happier : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82xlr_cao_k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n81tfwxrzto, 
  give the man a break . 
  for a night , many here would go way lower ( standards ) .

  yeah , fuck him . 
  and israel is not even in europe . . why does n't he hang around / r/middleeast ? 
  i know it 's boring but fortunately you can just skip these romanian news . 
  in romania everybody has internet , even the kids , so they post boring stuff . . what can you do ; they are just kids . 
   hitler 's peace offers to britain in the summer of 1940 were real , and churchill was wrong to refuse them [ from here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/churchill,_hitler_and_the_unnecessary_war )  churchill outmanoeuvred halifax by calling a meeting of his 25-member outer cabinet , to whom he delivered a passionate speech , saying `` if this long island story of ours is to end at last , let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground '' , [ 1 ] convincing all present that britain must fight on against hitler whatever the cost . 
  [ from here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_1940_war_cabinet_crisis ), 
   however the biggest tragedy imo is that they didnt try to reconcile with each other after the first iirc it was churchill who wanted to crush the germans and refused any reconciliation . . 
  imho , romania has a chance of becoming `` a poland of the balkans '' only if pushed by us interests in the region . 
  historically romania is the slow follower always looking for a model in france , uk , germany . 
  we are mostly defensive and we have too little pride and ambition to lead anything . 
  could you please interpret for me why is romanian at the center of that map . . 
  thanks, 
  yeah , that weird patch we call it hungary or pannonia, 
   it will likely include some generous funding from the eu for the reincorporation of the north why would eu pay for this ? 
  i ca n't see how would that be justified . . can we also have some of these funds for `` reintegration '' of moldova ? 
  yes , rom\u00e2nia has ( literally ) more axes per capita than france . . , 
  so , do you have bearded women ? 
   and be as close as possible with them and china [ that 's a very good plan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uph9ikpm-fk ) . 
  traditionally we tried to keep a good relation with china too ( as a leverage against soviet union ! ), 
  and there was a revival attempt recently but it 's hard to ride three horses ( eu & us already have big interests . . ) . 
  who knows , maybe you can :d, 
  so what does these results actually mean for serbia ? 
  will it get closer to eu or closer to russia ? 
   thanks, 
  parking is a big problem indeed but apart from that there are few abnormalities i think . 
  i do n't know the dutch but imho the french are not shit at all . . 
  i 've been driving in paris & ile de france ( the busiest region ) for a long time and i ca n't remember not even a single serious wtf moment . . 
  amateurs !, 
  right ? 
  i have sincere sympathy ( yeah , not the classical arrogant `` sympathy '' ) for the moldovan people but they have to responsibly choose their own destiny . 
  if they want to join romania , cool , we want it too even if it will be a temporary burden for all of us . 
  if they do n't want it , it 's really no problem , we can survive quite well probably both on our own . 
  i hope in the following 5 to max 10 years the thing will arrive to a conclusion because i do n't like this feeling that we have to continuously bribe the moldovans for their own good and if they join us , we will be held responsible for their well being because that 's why they joined . 
  i hope at the right moment , they will be informed what are the advantages/disadvantages ( for all the ethnicities of moldova ) of a union with romania , what are the advantages/disadvantages with this pseudo-independence or with closer ties to russia and they should make the choice and assume the consequences . 
  if they join us , cool , welcome home , this is your room , keep it tidy , we 'll try to help . 
  if they do n't join us i think the moldovan people should be treated in romania at least as well as before but any monetary help and special treatment towards the moldovan government should be reduced to the minimum ( the normal `` neighbors without benefits '' kind of relationship ) . 
  no wonder many respect stalin to this day . . 
  anyway , i do n't care how they live in their lands or what super power fantasies they enjoy as long as they remain there . 
  you expressed an opinion , i expressed a different opinion . . do n't turn against me , i did n't impose anything on you . 
  let 's stop here . 
  have a good day , sir .

  eurovision is a european competition of `` my crap slightly better than your crap , please vote my crap and i 'll vote yours '' . 
  do n't be afraid to admit it , it 's not your fault . 
  it was a mediocre song for teary eyed grandmothers . . with romania kicked out , europe gained 5 minutes of not listening to boring music and 10 minutes not seeing moldova , italy and spain voting again the romanian noise . 
  for me it 's good news . . 
  this means the average eurovision quality went up a bit and i can watch it without the usual embarrassment . 
  i do n't know why but eurovision in general has very low quality music and that voting system is like a separate ( bad ) show by itself . 
  i 'll be quite impressed if there will be 5 good songs this year .

  we tried that in romania and it was n't [ so cool as it sounds . . ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=romania+cozi+la+lapte&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;biw=1309&amp;bih=673 ),

  unfortunately she 's not bright nor very competent and the people do n't really take her seriously . 
  she sailed the wave of sympathy for her father and got the support of a party . . and that 's how she ended up where she is . 
  fyi , we travel visa free to and from eu since before 2007 and from 2007 some even consider us part of eu . . 
  i know , it 's amazing . . 
  15.4 % wow !!!, 
  that 's low . 
  he looked better last time i checked . 
  if he drops below 15 % i think we should execute that vile scum and his wife for christmas . 
  if you show me your polls , i 'll show you mine . . p.s. 
  and then i 'll show you hollande 's polls . . edit after your edit :  he 's turned against that after he lost power and more and more of his associates are indicted he did n't turn against justice . . he expressed his doubts about some things and some persons as opposed to other politicians who scream `` political revenge '' and deny everything every time they are accused of something . 
  today he said he will present himself in front of the prosecutor without questioning the justice even if these accusations were already part of a suit which was dropped in 2012 and it 's now conveniently reopened when basescu considers to enter the race for the position of mayor of bucharest . 
  it 's not the first time when controversial persons bring bogus accusations against him and he successfully defends himself in justice . 
  but nevermind , let the trial go on and we will see . 
   and i have german class at school because i prepare to take your jooob !!!, 
  just kidding , sorry , sorry . . could n't resist, 
  regardless . 
  you pulled that `` basescu is anything but popular '' straight from your ass . 
  many people do n't and did n't praise him but for a 2 term , 10 years ex-president his popularity is more than ok and you can see that in the comment sections of most `` neutralish '' online news papers . 
  yeah , `` basescu is anything but popular in romania at the moment '' my ass . 
  basescu is one of the main actors who fought for and started what you see today : a functioning justice and a strong dna . 
  a justice that did n't have fear to put basescu 's brother behind the bars while basescu was still in power . 
  the man is definitely not perfect but he had political balls , he had reasonable positions regarding many internal and external issues , he said frankly what he wanted and during his term romania had a clear and sound foreign policy and the people were better informed than today about who what and why happens . 
  `` chill '' ??? 
  we really like and always liked the germans , even when the rest of europe feared or hated them . 
  there are many historic reasons ( the romanian [ royal family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_i_of_romania ) who united romania was from germany , romania had good relations with both post-ww2 germanies ) but the german minority in romania was and is quite well regarded ( you probably know about [ klaus iohannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_iohannis ) ) and the fact that they were loyal to romania helped a lot ( as opposed to the hungarian minority which was always regarded with suspicion ) . 
  the only time when the germans in romania had problems was when romania was under russian occupation and the ( retaliatory ) decisions were basically taken by moscow . 
  as far as i know romania had no civil war in it 's entire existence although it 's composed of three big and previously independent regions and after unification the government was always centralized . 
  what 's most interesting is that in 1989 the `` new leaders '' , who were in fact the second echelon of the romanian communist party and who seized the power from ceausescu , needed the appearance of a civil war ( a fight between `` we , the democrats '' and `` they , the ceausescu 's terrorists '' ) to legitimize their power grab but there was no `` natural civil war '' ( nobody in the army or secret services wanted to fight for ceausescu or the previous regime ) so they had to fake it and the upper command of the army gave orders to different units to attack each other for the show ( for example the unit defending the otopeni airport was informed that it will be `` attacked by a column of terrorists '' while another unit was sent to otopeni `` to help '' but it was massacred by the defending unit ) .
