  romania is the only non slavic country in the region standing between the russian empire and it 's dream of having control of bosphorus and/or a sea port at the adriatic . 
  the process of russification of romanians started in 1812 with the occupation of half of the historic region of moldova but was halted in 1918 when the romanian state was consolidated with the help of the french . 
  ( ` pula ' means ` dick ' in romanian . . ), 
  romania and china had very good commercial and political relations during 1960-1989 when china was not so developed yet and romania still had some industrial and military exports interesting for the chinese . 
  the relation was so solid that in 1968 when romania was in danger to be invaded by soviets ( like czechoslovakia ) , the chinese threatened the soviets with the invasion of siberia if they attacked romania and in 2013 , when the chinese prime minister li keqiang visited romania , the romanian president declared that `` we will never forget the chinese government 's position in 1968 '' and thanked for the chinese support . 
  lol , i know about colonies . . but i thought you were colonizing them . . not the opposite . 
  no , seriously , why so many black people ? 
  ( also what lots of eastern europeans ask ), 
  i think it is . 
  probably because adolf weakened the british empire to such extent that it ( nearly ? ), 
  collapsed and india got it 's independence much earlier than they expected ? 
  in romanian ` cap ' ( and it 's derivative ` capat ' ) has multiple meanings depending on the context too : cap = head , capul = the head , capul mesei = the head of the table , de la capat = from the beginning , pana la capat = to the end , de la un capat la celalalt = from one end to the other , capul organizatiei = the head of the organisation , capetenia = the leader ( of some tribe for example ; it 's used mostly in historic/military context ) ; afaik these are all the meanings so it 's not so versatile like in catalan . 
  i think italian and spanish are the easiest languages to learn and to pronounce correctly for romanians ( with little or no accent ) because romanian has all the sounds that italian and spanish have . . so the tongue is already trained to pronounce them . 
  first they infiltrate with civilians , then they declare independence and after that they join china with a referendum . 
  watch out , the chinese learn fast . . 
  true story , 
  yeah , we borrowed slavic words before it was cool :d, 
  relax guys . 
  it 's impossible now and historically it was always almost impossible to be totally independent and sovereign in south-east europe ( right between 2 or 3 empires or spheres of influence ) . 
  the best thing we can do now ( i 'm romanian btw ) is to stick together , defend our ( mostly economic ) common interests and avoid being divided by the usual big players . 
  one day china will want to `` defend all the chinese '' no matter where they are ( just like putin 's russia `` defends '' the russians in the neighboring countries ) . 
  that will be the day when you will kiss goodbye siberia . 
  i ca n't say i 'm sorry for your empire . . 
  it 's strange that in catalan you have the same word for `` new '' like in romanian ( nou ) and there are many more identical words ( cap , nas , fum , pruna ? ), 
  you can count the romanians among the infidels too . . 
  i do n't know where this culinary habit started , but in romania when you say pizza , ketchup is the next word on everyone 's mind . 
  without pizza , ketchup has no use . 
  i was just getting ready to be outraged and now you ruined it . . 
  yeah , let 's give 11 millions of euros to someone for a little statuette . 
  it 's `` for culture '' . 
  millions of peasants will be enlightened . 
  those 40 % romanians living in poverty will be poor `` but cultured '' now . 
  totally worth it . 
  ^ ( what a load of shite for proud idiots . ), 
  you have seen too much kung-fu & triads movies . 
  a lot of the chinese people living in france are enterprising and slightly wealthier people who try to stay as far away as possible of triads , mafias or any shady people extorting them `` for protection '' . 
  they are successful in france exactly because the police is more efficient and less corruptible than in other places . 
  paying some mafia for protection is the shortest way to become a slave for the respective mafia . 
  but romania was in warsaw pact too . . 
  [ malicious lies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k5m0xtxqvq ) my friend . . 
  it 's all malicious lies . . 
  do you really think angela will send the doctors and the engineers to be hosted in eastern europe ? 
  see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4x0ylr/the_romanians_shown_in_the_sky_news_video/d6bkku4 ), 
  i fail to see how using any legal means to stop the formation of a trust which could affect the polish long term interests ( economic independence ) on their territory ( or even outside ! ), 
  is immoral or `` low standard '' . 
  it would be completely stupid not to do it !, 
  what if gazprom asked to buy the lng terminal in poland and paid a nice price on it ? 
  should poland sell it because that 's democratic and legal ? 
  of course you would block the transaction any way possible . 
  i understand you are pro-russian interests but not everyone else is stupid . 
  should i remember you what russia did in chechnya to protect their own interests ? 
  btw , send [ this to putin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo2ql_x1wi0 ) for me please . . 
  so if russia can chase its interests `` the russian '' way , why ca n't poland do the same ? 
  if russia can spit in the face of everyone in eastern europe why should we keep bargaining with russia instead of just uncompromisingly turning our back to them until they learn to respect us and our interests too ? 
  bicoz-aor-beican is cheaper !, 
  also because who knows what [ the heck ??? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9fjb9hkg4 ) you did with those pigs before !!, 
  i wonder what would you feel , if i make up and publish widely `` the story '' that you are a repeat sexual offender ( i pay several women to act like victims of sexual harassment and `` to confess '' what you did ) and no one employs you anymore and people start to avoid you . 
  small lies may have small effects but big lies can have bigger , longer and more unpleasant consequences and no one should suffer those consequences just because you need `` your right to make up stuff '' . 
  weird . 
  i for example want no religion in any school . 
  why not please me rather than that fuckin bishop ? 
  i bet the same scenario was applied with their report on `` mexican drug labs '' ... it 's all a pile of cra . . journalistic fantasies , sold to fill the air time in the west . 
  if i could bring back home all the romanians bothering you , i would , in a second . .  but i ca n't . 
  also you ca n't return all the british banks and corporations profits made in romania nor can we take all their romanian assets which were bought extremely cheaply with british capital ( many times with corruption & political pressuring ) from under the nose of the poor romanian public which was suddenly seeing all that was valuable in their country being `` privatized '' to special interests from uk , france and other big players . 
   dont start viewing those times through rose tinted glasses . 
  eastern europe had no terrorism nor wars and during the late 60 's and 70 's it was quite well economically too . 
  it was the 80 's and the 90 's that sunk us in the toilet economically , ruined our confidence and convinced us everything was and is so much better in western europe . 
  sky news paid some people who legally owned those hunting or collection guns to act like they were gun smugglers and to say that they can procure and sell any weapon to anyone who pays , including terrorists . 
  dude , get lost . 
  sky news probably paid you to defend their ass on reddit . 
   what the hell did they think would happen ? 
  they 've probably thought that it will be like the previous occasions when they paid some gypsies in some ghetto to say shit on camera about romania and how their intentions were `` to mass migrate to uk '' and no one tried to debunk their `` journalism '' and expose them blatantly lying to the british public . 
  it 's shits and giggles until we get to accusations of weapons trafficking . 
  yeah , parts of your dear british media insists on keeping you dumb and misinformed and we have proof . 
  apparently they succeeded with you if you side with them so vigorously . . 
  man wtf ? 
  why so salty ? 
  give me my upvote back and go your merry way !, 
  [ i told you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aajslfupro ) those noobs are going to be busted in a matter of days ... 
  the fuckin amateurs left clues all over the place . . [ previously ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wk0sn/gang_selling_ak47s_bound_for_western_europe/d67olfn ), 
  i think many romanians picked french because although it 's familiar ( and easier to learn than german for example ) , still french is not so easy to learn compared to italian and spanish which many romanians can easily learn by hearing or from tv soap operas . 
  why are you surprised ? 
  romania is francophone  . 
  historically , romania & the romanian language was influenced a lot by france & the french ( i would say more than any other influence , be it russian , turkish , german , hungarian ) . 
  it smells like a bullshit terror campaign . 
  only the british news imagine romania has `` remote parts '' where the government ceases to exist like in colombia or something . 
  from what they filmed , there are enough clues for any serious intelligence service to identify the location and make a list of suspects based on the car and the traits of the `` smugglers '' in a matter of days if not hours . 
  i do n't think there are many jeeps like that in romania . . these guys are going to have a surprise , but i think this might be staged . . 
  i have never thought about the origin of the word '' \u0219trand '' in romanian . . 
  apparently it 's from german , 
  it 's [ fix pula la suta ] ( https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/pula%20la%20suta ) . . almost nothing, 
  iirc , orban was the first who raised the issue of the hungarian minorities from transcarpathia and jobik went for autonomy as usual . 
  because it 's one thing to declare war against russia over a disputed region ( bessarabia ) and occupy it and totally different to host and supply nazi troops as allies on your territory , to declare war together with the nazis against all the allies , to participate to an atrociously criminal war on russian land and to try to annihilate russia and it 's communist regime . 
  if we were n't so stubbornly allied with the nazis ( by antonescu ) we could have obtained a separate peace with the soviet union . 
  i wonder how would the history have looked if that damned fool antonescu would n't have stepped over the dniester . . 
  i think the ruskies would have still occupied moldova but not romania and we would n't have paid those heavy war reparations . . maybe we could have remained `` neutral '' like finland ? 
  how would romania look today without 50 years of communism . . hmm . . nice dream . 
  by force it is excluded . 
  hungary , romania , slovakia & poland are bound by nato & other laws and treaties .
