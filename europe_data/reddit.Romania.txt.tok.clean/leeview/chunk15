  the straw man ? 
   the guy talking about juncker tusk etc had a good point i 'm going on a limb here but i think the guy talking about immigration had a very good point too . . do we still pretend that immigration is not a serious problem ? 
  i think we need to build more mutual trust and a common european identity before i want to allow romanian army units sacrificed by foreign commandants ( in place of sacrificing their own people ) or the romanian economy mismanaged by foreign bureaucrats { [ like the valev plan for example ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fro.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fplanul_valev&amp;edit-text= ) } possibly with ties to foreign special interests totally out of the reach of romanian voters . 
  i 'm not `` the romanian from above '' but i 'm truly sorry for the present and future suffering of common people ( from uk & eu alike ) affected by this mess . 
  please do n't take very seriously the careless remarks easily thrown here because they are not representative , not even for reddit . 
  also do n't forget there are many eastern europeans who have been enduring years of relentless humiliation , mocking ( the famous british tabloids with their limitless imagination ) and irl discrimination and condescending treatment in uk with no recourse . 
  do n't be surprised if those people are not very elegant today when they got an occasion to return the favor . 
  from [ here ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html ) : 1 . 
  any member state may decide to withdraw from the union 2 . the union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state 3 . 
  the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period . 
  by the looks of it , eu wants quick negotiation of withdrawal and no extension therefore `` the treaties '' might `` cease to apply '' a lot earlier than 2 years after notification , which is the maximum withdrawal negotiation deadline . 
  i 'm not really surprised they want a short and brutal split . . knowing that long and soft departures are a clear invitation to eu breakup . 
  if uk sends the withdrawal notification , i guesstimate that 2017 will be their last year in eu ( remember all those leaders saying that they already discussed what happens if brexit ) and in january 2018 we 'll have a new breed of eu . 
  that kind of experience happened to me the first time i overheard a group of people speaking the aromanian language in a metro station in paris . 
  at that time i knew very little of other `` romanian dialects '' ( i thought they were extinct ) . 
  i had never heard anything like that before and i was quite confused by the weird succession of totally incomprehensible words combined with pure romanian words and also words that would sound so familiar yet have no meaning . 
  i agree with you . . uk & eu should not rush but from what i read just minutes ago [ `` eu leaders are ferm : uk should leave eu asap . 
  there will be no negotiation '' ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hotnews.ro%2fstiri-esential-21106235-martin-schulz-presedintele-parlamentului-european-declaratie-dura-marea-britanie-trebuie-paraseasca-cat-mai-rapid.htm&amp;edit-text= ) the things seem quite irreversible now . 
  we will see . . 
  maybe boris and nigel had more success than they wanted but now they should be allowed ( if not forced ) to come with concrete plans how to `` make britain great again '' or else be hanged on the london bridge by the same credulous mobs who listened to them . 
  personally i wish you the best, 
  i foresee tremendous growth in the british manure sector . . , 
  yes , the `` us trojan horse '' is out . . not much regrets there . 
  the lazy ass bruxelles bureaucracy dreaming in their golden nest better learn a lesson and make things better for everyone . 
  chill dude , there is life after brexit . 
  look on the bright side , if things go worse now you have way fewer people to blame and you do n't need to make trips to bruxelles for every protest . 
  i think only those who do n't know how hard and expensive is to untangle economies , budgets and bureaucratic infrastructure can imagine eu re-accepting uk as an admission candidate in 10-20 years . 
  it will simply not happen in the next ~ 30 years to say the least and every new admission from now on will be highly scrutinized regarding this aspect . 
   blue eyes are far more exotic true , yet `` in practice '' if you have a nice face and beautifully shaped eyes , the color becomes totally insignificant . 
  i have never seen a `` not interesting '' face which would have been clearly more attractive if only it had `` blue/green/black / brown '' eyes or brown/red/black / blonde hair . 
   i would urge my government not to fuck them over . . 
  yes , yes . . they should not be fucked with fervor but with passionless contempt . . 
  i 'm all for it , 
  if i was asked to name that language without knowing anything about the video . . 
  i would have said `` meh , this is easy , it 's hungarian , bazd meg ! '' . 
  i should know , because i grew up hearing hungarian right ? 
  well that would be wrong , it 's `` polar hungarian '' ( finnish ) . 
  after that `` fuck your nato fleet , romania '' you are all russians to us . . we always suspected you ( and serbia ) of being russians in disguise . . ( at least serbia was open about it . . ) now we have no more doubts . 
  ( it 's not wise to safe keep your balls in putin 's palms - it 's nice and warm at first but that fucker has a very tight grip ) edit : have an upvote though ( they are downvoting you and i do n't know why ) . 
  chill man , it 's not personal . 
  some people just feel rejected by your pretentious referendum and hope that alone you will fail  . . it 's normal and it will go away, 
  i do n't know if it helps but we still love your welfare !, 
  no , seriously , `` england '' ( uk ) was not treated that bad and they got some compromises from eu but the truth is uk joined for economic reasons and the partial loss of sovereignty was already too much for the uk upper class . 
  personally i 'm sure the uk political establishment `` kinda always knew '' they were not going to give up total sovereignty and they were going to quit right before being asked to give up more . . 
  i 'm romanian and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhreqkrvone ) sounds hungarian and equally weird to me too . . 
  as a romanian who grew up with hungarian neighbors i can tell you that your language and the way you speak and stress some sounds is extremely funny ( comical ) for us ( and also totally incomprehensible apart from a few words i learned over time ) . 
  i could barely listen anything in hungarian without smiling like an idiot . . 
  i think you greatly under-estimate how well informed is putin about almost anything politically important from all the countries that matter . 
  as the kim philby affair proves , stalin `` knew things '' long before the british commons and as with all the top level political men , what they know is a lot more ( and sometimes quite different ) than what they say . 
  just because it first appeared in a french cook-book says almost nothing about the recipe . . because i 'm quite sure the book came after the recipe and maybe the cook-book was french because they afforded the luxury to write/print a cook-book when books were rare & expensive and the people mostly illiterate . 
  i know many foods and culinary habits were propagated in eastern europe from the french , germans and austrians ( often via hungary ) but the `` kocsonya '' looks so inelegant and unsophisticated that it could be `` invented '' by any primitive having some pig meat & bones and a pot ( just boil those damned bones and leftovers and wait until they cool off and presto : kocsonya ! ), 
  well , at minute 80 i was packing my luggage . . then i realized i live in france and i do n't have to go home even if we lose . 
  dear brits , `` just do it '' . . it will be worse for a while but then you will recover and it will be only bad as usual, 
  hungary played better the second part of the match . . but the game was kind of unfriendly . 
  is there a traditional rivalry between these two teams or it was only my impression ? 
  you do n't think very analytically . . and it 's quite visible , also you argue anything but the main points and when you 're out of ideas you throw insults from the high horse . 
  how original . . 
  why is that every time someone claims to be raped , there 's always the naive around who are ready to believe it 100 % totally ignoring other possibilities even when the circumstances do n't exclude other possibilities and make it very hard to know what really happened ? 
  you are always ready to believe that a man raped a woman if she says so , but you do n't even consider that a woman can lie that she was raped when a man says so . 
  why ? 
  if you want to know what really happened , you have to listen to both sides ' version , listen to other witnesses , collect the physical evidence and then make a conclusion about what is the most probable chain of events . 
  you did nothing like this but you `` just know '' she was raped because women that go alone in qatari nightclubs ca n't lie right ? 
  if i 'm an asshole you are an idiot . . and failing to think about other possibilities is a good argument why you are an idiot . 
  dutch woman alone in a nightclub in qatar . . something is very out of place here . 
  if she was eastern european instead of dutch . . everybody would have presumed she was a prostitute . . 
   and proposed kovesi tho before winning elections to become pm he signed agreement this sentence might need some clarification ? 
  the idea of an `` outside threat '' is also an efficient way to keep under control / `` united '' a large mass of not very homogeneous people . 
  with enough propaganda , you can smash any internal dissent `` and no one will bat an eye '' as long as you blame it on outside forces . 
  there is no shame . 
  iohannis is not an idiot . 
  he ca n't be an idiot if he successfully managed a mid size city ( [ sibiu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_iohannis#mayor_of_sibiu ) ) and was reelected several times . 
  his problem is that presidency is quite different than managing a city . 
  being president requires good communication skills and a very good team of experts on foreign policy and well connected and reputed counselors . 
  his communication skills in romanian are kind of lacking but this is not the most important issue ( hey at least he speaks well with merkel !, 
  the problem is , he does n't have a very solid and competent team around him , at least not yet . 
  but the most damaging thing to iohannis ' image is the fact that he follows to presidency after president basescu who had more political experience ( ex-mayor of bucharest , ex-minister in an earlier government ) when he took the presidency ( for 2 x 5 years ) and was also very vocal , firm , competent and very combative with his political enemies ( some of which were known to be corrupt ) . 
  the people got used to basescu who had a well defined and solid foreign policy and who used to inform the public regularly on what he discussed at bruxelles , washington and so on . 
  i hope this clarifies a bit why some people are somehow dissapointed but many are not very worried about iohannis yet . 
  he still has time to improve his image and efficiency as president . 
  i think the screams are real . 
  it 's the shafted vw customers wanting support for their cars . . terrible screams, 
  yeah , steel is the new gold here . . 
  we 'll see in 5-10 years . . until now it appears that a lot of idiots in ( any ) position of power continue to underestimate their chances of making prison for various `` affairs '' which probably went unpunished for decades before . . 
  can someone translate the joke for the romance side of europe ? 
  thanks  and thank you for creating a precedent . . 
  i do n't know what the reaction would have been if our advertisements had shown old ladies being punched with a heated iron in sweat shops for fun , 
   this does n't really sound like dutch to me , more like some hillbilly german . 
  oh man , it 's so simple ... 
  if a person seems to be choking while speaking . . it 's dutch if it 's more like a cough , it 's probably german . . / joke :d, 
  our team resisted surprisingly well to the french . . 
  i was quite afraid of a nasty defeat but in the end we nearly got an honorable 1-1 . . too bad tatarusanu failed to reach that last bullet . . 
  it might sound naive but the grand majority of romanians did n't have a clue what eu gives and what it takes . 
  the average people in romania only now begin to see what they really get from eu because the eu funds absorption was for a long time ( and still is ) quite low in romania , but in the last 2-3 years there were finalized more and more visible projects partly funded by eu . 
  for many romanians , just having access to the eu work market ( and escaping any shadow of the `` russian sphere of influence '' ) would have been a good enough reason to join eu . 
  i know you see a lot of romanian beggars but romania as a country historically was rather rich , self reliant and quite happy if no one was robbing us ( like the soviets with the disproportionate war reparations ) therefore it has low expectations to receive much from others . . 
  i barely heard her make some public declarations and it was so easy to understand she 's a bright , educated and ambitious person . 
  i was really sorry when i heard she did n't win but i 'm glad she 's not giving up . 
  and where are the polar bears ? 
  damn , the heaven will be filled with bielorussian saints . . , 
   it 's amazing how confused russia gets over these things do you really believe `` russia gets confused '' over these things ?
