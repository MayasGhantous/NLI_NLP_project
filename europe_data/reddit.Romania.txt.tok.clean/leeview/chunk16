  how would that even happen ? 
  do you think the russian general command staff stood in meetings for weeks , half arguing that it 's clearly offensive , while half insisting that maybe it 's just defensive and after a while they just concluded , `` ah , fuck it , let 's insist it 's offensive and see what happens '' ? 
  i really liked [ this clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyjythtgok ) . . because it manages to convey something very hard to describe yet familiar for me as a romanian . . 
  nah , just add [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyfrxaimthk ) and it will be perfect !!!, 
  we got the hater / joke, 
  our `` indian refugees '' will be totally civilized by the time they finish the assimilation of those muslim hordes . . 
  how about you assimilate the refugees you already have and we civilize our gypsies first and close some external borders until then . . 
  there is no anger in his message . . or i fail hard to see it ( i doubt it ) . 
  romanians are just not very angry against we ( not even against the freaking netherlands who is blocking us for some very obscure interests ) . 
  but it is not very hard to see , there is no strong , reliable german , french and italian commitment against the russian interests offensive in eastern europe . 
  i prefer a productive relationship with serbia and bulgaria than a totally symbolic presence in visegrad group . 
  afaik some of the most important and successful [ national projects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_gates ) were made in collaboration with yugoslavia/serbia . 
  and as they said when the talks started . . craiova group can be a good partner of visegrad group in whatever interests both parties . . 
  romania is not so much afraid of being attacked by russia . . romania is more worried about what will russia do against romanian interests in moldova . 
  if russia would drop moldova from it 's grip , we would have very little fear of or dependence on russia . 
  in the last 25 years romania gathered external military & political support not only for itself but also for moldova . . so we would n't like to see all that work ruined by some new [ molotov-ribbentrop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) or who knows , medviedev-le pen ? 
   poland , romania , finland and baltics just hate russia . 
  can confirm , and by the looks of it . . it will remain like that for a long time . . 
  so honest question then ( i like to hear other opinions ) . 
  who were the terrorists then ? 
  at who 's order were they ? 
  what did they try to achieve ? 
  and more importantly , why and how did they dissappear from arrest ? 
  how do you explain that not a single one was tried and condemned ? 
  we can go to great lengths with this . . but imho : 1 . false . . iliescu , fsn and other organizers of the coup made great efforts in the days after 21 december to increase iliescu 's and fsn popularity and legitimacy . 
  that 's why immediately after ceausescu left the command center , the organizers of the coup went straight to the only tv station of the country and started emitting propaganda demonizing ceausescu and promoting the new `` figures and heroes '' , iliescu , petre roman , nicolae militaru and so on . . 2 . you try to imply that what his killers said about ceausescu after 21 december is what was believed by the general population before 21 december . . false . 
  the people were tired of ceausescu but from there up to killing him it 's a long way . 
  they needed to demonize him well before they were able to kill him and even now many people think he should have not been killed . 
  3 . false . . in 1989 the romanian army captured and killed it 's supreme commander . 
  that 's a very illegal and hard to justify action . 
  when some of the army top heads planed it , they did n't know how securitate , the population or even other parts of the army would react . 
  so in order to justify their coup and convince everyone that ceausescu must go or even die , the organizers accused ceausescu and securitate of killing `` almost 60.000 romanians '' right from the beginning . 
  these false rumors of huge numbers of people killed by `` teroristi '' and `` securisti '' were promoted on tv quite early even if at that point the total people killed at the orders of ceausescu was no more than ~ 50 ( 43 from timisoara ) . 
  the organizers already planned the blood bath which they were blaming on ceausescu & securitate and then they just followed those plans . . the rest is history . 
  i 'm also in paris now , can confirm your confirmation . . 
  i might be a serbian lost in romania . . 
  i just fuckin love serbian music . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njhnntipp5y ( maybe it helps that i do n't understand it therefore i can listen anything with serenity ), 
   i find it idiotic to claim that iliescu needed to kill people to gain legitimacy i find it equally idiotic to claim that ceausescu needed to kill people or even random soldiers in order to gain his power back . 
  but i could see why iliescu , his branch of pcr and some people in the army would need a good excuse to liquidate ceausescu . 
  ( he knew them all , and he knew it was a coup d'etat , he said it even [ on film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll2howo_p20 ) before they executed him ) . 
  so they blamed ceausescu and securitate for the crimes in timisoara and for all the chaotic crimes they were facilitating then all over the country and after they killed ceausescu , they conveniently said , `` well , we had to . . if we did n't , people would have continued to die '' . 
  everybody was hunting terrorists while iliescu , fsn = ex-pcr and the same army people who shot protesters in timisoara took control of the power and money . 
  but first i have to insist , it 's not iliescu . . it 's the army and iliescu and some other people around him . 
  it 's the army who neutralized ceausescu and gave the power to iliescu and co. 
  the army plan was already in execution when iliescu entered the public scene . 
  it was the army leadership and iliescu who killed those soldiers at otopeni , not ceausescu nor special units loyal to him . 
  if the terrorists were loyal to ceausescu , they would have killed the `` heads of the coup '' , iliescu or stanculescu right then in 21 december when they were parading publicly to televiziunea romana . 
   i think there were a number of loyal people/special units that were activated for this kind of events that 's the official story . . now lets say it is true . 
  lets say there were some special units who were loyal to ceausescu and fought up to the last moment to free and reinstate ceausescu . 
  if these special units were the `` terrorists '' who killed civilians and soldiers ( all over the country ) how can you explain that not only they failed to localize where ceausescu was detained and try to free him by assaulting that base ( instead they were killing random people and valueless soldiers all over the country - what would that achieve ? 
  ) , but also not a single one of the `` terrorists '' captured then or killed by the army and population and some of them were even filmed . . not a single one was retained , named and accused of anything ? 
  where did they disappear ? 
  who freed them ? 
  why would the army free them after all the dead soldiers ? 
  why would the new power free them after they killed for ceausescu ? 
  many former romanian communist party members or dignitaries close to ceausescu were condemned and imprisoned then for ridiculous reasons , some even without any evidence but not a single terrorist . . no trace . 
  ] ( https://mariusmioc.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/o-problema-ramasa-de-lamurit-teroristii-de-dupa-22-decembrie-1989/ ) imho `` the terrorists '' were diversionary units at the orders of the army and people around iliescu . 
  the army organised all this coup d'etat dressed as a revolution - it was the general stanculescu who disobeyed ceausescu 's orders and grabbed the power and also it was the army who captured and executed ceausescu in secret , not the revolutionaries . 
  it 's no coincidence the `` terrorists '' were activated after ceausescu had already lost control and was detained and they `` disappeared '' at the right moment with the tacit consent of the leadership of the army and the first governments after 1989 . 
  i 'm not sure how accurate that information is . . from what i know it was `` quite the opposite '' . 
  ceausescu had sent some `` old and reliable '' army generals at timisoara and the secret service `` securitate '' played an important role in identifying and killing some of the early participants at the protests . 
  it 's very unlikely that ceausescu tried to use `` the people '' against the people . 
  in the context of mass protests , it would have been impossible to distinguish who to arm and who not to . 
  afaik , the patriotic guards were mobilized and armed only after ceausescu fell , by the `` new '' people who took the power ( ion iliescu and his entourage ) and apparently their motive was to maintain the chaos and appearance of a civil war from which the `` new power '' ( it was not new !!, 
  it was the second echelon of the communist party and many secret agents - not the democrats the people wanted ) to come out victorious and therefore legitimized . 
  giving guns to an ( intentionally ) very dis-informed population ( who was in an imaginary war with ceausescu 's `` terrorists '' ) led to many totally useless deaths . 
  that 's why there were way more deaths in the days after ceausescu lost the power than before . . and the fucking iliescu is still free and well . 
  what you describe may be a war crime but having large amounts of apparent civilians in enemy occupied territory capable of organizing some resistance or ready to be activated in some circumstances is something that happened before and probably will happen again . 
  some countries ' geography is just too favorable to guerrillas and romania i think [ is one of them . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_anti-communist_resistance_movement ), 
  i help you with this : it 's mostly because they have no real alternative . 
  now that i think , i 'm curios what 's the situation with the swiss army ? 
  iirc you have some [ atypical military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_switzerland ) organization in switzerland and lots of people have periodic military training and own guns . 
  is n't training those conscripts or volunteers also against geneva convention ? 
  does geneva convention say anything about `` green men '' and covert invasions of neighbors ? 
  how about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) ? 
  do you think russia cared ? 
  conventions are for the weak . . , 
  [ even you can learn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tahfukkkmjm ) and stop trolling . . 
  i agree , but poland and romania were not and will not be allowed to have nukes ever . . so romania , tried to defend itself with the next best thing . . chemical & bacteriological weapons and lots of people with enough training and weapons to discourage easy border jumping . 
  do n't forget that before 1989 , romania was almost completely surrounded by soviet union and soviet troops stationed in hungary and bulgaria . 
   though how would russia reach poland through belarus for this to be a risk ? 
  russia is already in kaliningrad . . and it 's perfectly intuitive to train civilians to defend themselves and to mercilessly sabotage any movement of an enemy . 
  he 's silly , in 1968 the large paramilitary organizations of romania ( combined with political support from china and even usa ) weighted enough to discourage a soviet invasion like in czechoslovakia . 
  a sufficiently trained paramilitary can rapidly transform any invasion into a new `` afghanistan '' . . paramilitary organisations matter . 
  we did this before it was cool / s  the guards were formed in 1968 , after the august 21 bucharest speech through which romanian leader nicolae ceau\u015fescu condemned the crushing of the prague spring by soviet forces . 
  ceau\u015fescu appealed to anti-soviet sentiments within the general population to ask for resistance against the perceived threat of a similar soviet maneuver against romania itself . 
   the patriotic guards were staffed by about 700,000 citizens in 1989 , both men and women . 
  in keeping with the doctrine of war of the entire people , the patriotic guards were a combined territorial defense or national guard and civil defense organization , which was established immediately after the soviet-led warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotic_guards_ ( romania ), 
   unleash pensioners !!!!, 
  this is the commercial division of the unholy wehrmacht !, 
  it 's all shits and bagels until the `` commercial deficit with germany '' panzer squishes you . . 
  oh man , we have so much in common ... 
   in romania , there 's like a civil war between senior citizens whenever a new supermarket opens that 's because in romania , the pensioners are trained like pavlov 's dog ; every time `` something new '' opens , they expect to find heavily discounted pans , kettles and other non-senses . . and they 've been waiting all their life for that god damned teflon pan !, 
  hon , hon . . 
  not cool mate , not cool . . edit : well after seeing all the downvotes ( wtf ? ) . . 
  you can consider this my way of saying fuck you too, 
  i agree with this man . . in the short run brexit will suck a lot for both parties but i think in the medium or long run it could be better for both sides or at least for eu . 
  i 'm afraid brexit is a necessary shock for eu to rethink it 's role , identity and to become more democratic , united and stronger in the end .
