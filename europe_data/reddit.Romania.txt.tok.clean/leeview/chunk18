  he `` knows with his gut '' like george bush . . 
  i wonder how did they arrive at the sum of 2500e ? 
  why not 2000 or 2200 and the 12 % shortage would disappear . 
  i have a friend in geneva who lives in a small but comfortable enough 1 room + kitchen apartment and pays a rent of iirc 900 euros . 
  2000/pers euros seem to be more than enough to subsist in emergency cases even in geneva . 
  i think in eastern europe `` offensive '' is probably a strong word for hetero `` long '' kisses and `` rather unpleasant '' describes it better . 
  for homosexual kisses the range is from `` very unpleasant '' to the mildly confused `` eewww wtf ?? '', 
  i would love to understand what it says . . is there an english/french version ? 
  or could you summarize for us please ? 
  thanks, 
  i agree that an universal basic income would have an effect on inflation/prices but a key aspect is to adjust ( continuously ? ), 
  the amount given so that it should be enough for basic survival ( social safety net - if you lose your job you should not be forced to beg on streets without any prospect of recovery ) but still low enough for people to have incentives to look for jobs . 
  romania is one of the worst example of secular states . 
  romanian orthodox church ( bor ) has way too much influence and control on the state and society and the brave romanian `` secular '' state still imposes the religious brainwashing of kids in schools at the pressure of the church . 
  religion and the parasitic role of the orthodox church is one of the reasons why romania is and will be for a long time a backward nation not only financially but also culturally . 
  edit : [ damned these thieving priests ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=popi+cu+mercedes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;biw=1234&amp;bih=652 ) . . now they got high speed internets to downvote me !, 
  i do understand that it will not be good for romania but it seems the restless russian leadership will just not settle in their fucking borders . 
  does it matter what was before 1918 ? 
  romania was allied with russia before the communists got the power in russia . 
  but with the communists or without them , bessarabia was populated with romanians and their will was to unite with the rest of romania . 
  so why invade bessarabia ? 
  russia just loves to `` respect the will of the people '' when it aligns with their interest or just invade when there is no `` will of the people '' . 
  give me a break with these double standards . 
  and i really hope putin gets a nuke straight in his ass . 
   last time you played against russia in 1941 and it did not ended well . 
  yeah , i know , but i really hope russia gets nuked this time . 
  today , like in june 1940 , [ russia is the `` good guy '' who is `` just defending himself '' by invading his weaker neighbors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) and then acts surprised if they retaliate . 
  it 's just not wise to collect so many enemies . 
  at one point , it can end up `` not so well '' for russia too . 
   strong argument . 
  every president/politic is saying something like this . 
  that is how it works . 
  you believe what you want , i believe what i want . 
  i followed this kind of news since long time and i know what russia says and especially i have seen what they do in the region . 
  i do n't believe us is holy and innocent but at least for the moment our interests align in south-eastern europe so we play it together . 
   in 2012 , the united states complained about alleged russian treaty violations . 
  [ 6 ] the two systems that appeared to be violations were the r-500 , a cruise missile using the 9k720 iskander launcher , and a short ranged icbm . 
  [ 7 ] in july 2014 , the united states formally notified russia of a breach , while russian officials called the treaty unsuitable for russia and unfair because other countries in asia had such weapons . 
  we could play a lot of ping pong like this but it does not really matter that much . 
  personally i 'm sure romania would n't have hosted nato installations nor us troops if russia had a more flexible , friendly and pragmatic attitude towards romania and it 's interests in the region ( moldova ) . 
  our ex-president said a long time ago that `` we tried to negotiate with russia for a long time , but they care only about their interests '' . 
  i think it 's fair for us to care about ours . 
  distance ; see my updated comment, 
   what if russia will place the same kind of device mexico cuba/mexico for russia is not exactly like romania for usa ( [ for example deveselu is 1200 km from kursk near the russian border ] ( http://www.distancefromto.net/ ) ) but if they agree , russia should go ahead and place their radars and defensive missiles wherever they want because no one can do much about it . 
  ( for example the russian presence in syria ), 
   the treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with intermediate ranges , defined as between 500 -- 5,500 km ( 300 -- 3,400 miles ) . 
  the treaty did not cover sea launched missiles . 
  which part you do n't understand ? 
  shut up and pay your taxes !, 
   what 's the discussion today ? 
  ( i 'm living & working in france , but obviously my view is partial ) . 
  what i think happens in france : there is a deep distrust between the employers and employees and the feeling among employees is that the employers are going to abuse any change in the labor laws to hurt everyone 's interest and lower the wages even more . 
  in theory france is this cozy worker 's paradise while in practice it 's a shitty hierarchical tyranny ( like many places ) where the higher you are in the hierarchy , the easier it gets and the harder you can fuck up at everyone 's expense without any serious consequences and the lower you are , the higher the pressure to do everything ( including more and more of your boss ' duties ) , to work overtime , at home or in weekends and all this with no raise in sight for years and almost zero bargaining power because jobs are scarce . 
  imho there are many people in france who abuse the protection offered by the employment laws ( especially in the public sector ) but giving almost free hand to the employers is equally unfair and quite dangerous . 
   but the missile shield is for `` iran '' , not for `` russia '' yes , and ukraine is attacked by `` pro-russian rebels '' not `` russian soldiers '' and so on . . 
  i see no problem here . 
  if putin can talk shit to our face why ca n't we talk shit to his ? 
   it 's the lack of growth that we have experienced `` growth '' the magic word . 
  everyone wants growth but where is this growth supposed to come from ? 
  can we eat 5 % more food this year than the previous ? 
  can we use 5 % more clothes , cars , housing ? 
  how could the population consume more if the salaries are stagnating since 2008 `` because reasons '' ? 
  now it 's the perfect time to default on some of those loans taken when 5 % growth year after year seemed a sure thing . 
  i do n't know why putin is bitching so much about his security and shit . 
  we should laugh like him when he says there are no russian troops in ukraine . 
  if there are no russian troops in ukraine , the shield is not against russia . 
  few years ago rogozin was bragging `` next time he will visit romania with a tupolev bomber '' . 
  now i dare him to come if he has the balls as big as his mouth is . 
  it 's good that something happens against corruption but unfortunately the parliament is full of bastards trying all the ways to dampen the enthusiasm of justice . 
  the root of the cause like in many places , it 's the electoral laws . 
  the political campaigns are financed with dirty money and the politicians recover their `` electoral costs '' by fraud and corruption . 
  the political parties are complicit to the scheme and they are full of rich thieves and opportunists . 
  do n't try to judge romania or other romanians by what / u/verylateish says ( or how she says it ) . 
  i 'm romanian myself and i always had a very hard time understanding her . 
  so hard that many times i was tempted to ask if she 's drunk or under influence of something but maybe she is just silly or under age . . or who knows . 
  i can live with the mystery . 
  let 's just say eu is a necessary compromise ( for all it 's members ) . 
  it 's not evil , at least not yet . 
  it could become quite bad if the euro bureaucrats are given too much power and too little control but let 's hope . 
  you are too pale to look like an italian . 
  ( looking at your down votes ) the internets has clearly spoken !, 
  i think your observation does not stand scrutiny . 
  i was n't disputing romanian measurements nor defending the romanian dick ( although now that i think , these wimpy romanian dicks kind of won transilvania by themselves by reproducing way faster than those lazy hussar schlongs ) nor trying to lengthen our collective dicks with fantastic anecdotes . 
  i was just pointing that there is a highly improbable situation in the data . 
   but i thought the magyar are from ural mountains . 
  the magyars yeah , the hungarians meh  the original magyar genetic contributions have become very diluted over the centuries due in large part to intermarriage with european tribes . 
  this means that the modern hungarian people are only somewhat descended from the ancient magyars whose language they speak . 
  http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/hungarians.html http://brilliantmaps.com/the-genetic-map-of-europe/ as you can see e3b is the size of the dick . . / s, 
  it goes both ways . 
  i see insecure kids downvoting a joke comment doubting their dubious statistical endowment . 
  just chill kids and pull out that hand from your pants . 
  it will be fine in the end . 
  true . 
  it 's not like austrians and germans because we do n't speak the same language . 
  but apart from that , the only thing differentiating us is the huge bulge the hungarians are carrying in their pants , 
  lol , you are quite observant . 
  not only we are just next to each other geographically but also genetically . 
  and we have many hungarians in transilvania . . etc. 
  if this statistic is valid , i might have `` more '' in common with the hungarians and the bulgars . . omg , i might be adopted !!, 
  more like hung-arian statistic . .  edit : bahahah a fucking insecure downvote !,
