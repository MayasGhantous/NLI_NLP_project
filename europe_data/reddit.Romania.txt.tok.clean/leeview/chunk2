  in addition to this there were many incidents where `` terrorists '' were attacking civilians and the regular troops defending important objectives in the cities . 
  these `` terrorists '' were most probably soldiers from scouting & diversion special operations battalion ( `` 404 cercetare-diversiune '' ) on a mission to create the illusion of an enemy . 
  another civil clash that did n't occur `` naturally '' was the [ t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t%c3%a2rgu_mure%c8%99 ) . 
  i think that 's tolerance when the alternative is persecution and slaughter . 
  the roms migrated everywhere in europe long time ago but they were violently rejected by some cultures while others just put them to some good use and later tolerated them and their parasitic ways of living . 
  slavery ( and serfdom ) was not applied exclusively to gypsies . 
  what you probably do n't know is that slavery is alive and well today inside the more `` traditional '' gypsy communities which have an internal organization which relies heavily on `` servants '' which are born to previous servants or bought by rich families and they do n't have a problem with it . 
  yeah , it 's amazing what several extermination camps can do . 
  they spread like partridges to other places where they were more tolerated . 
  ciocarlia and maria tanase is recognized even by teenagers ( not the uneducated ones ) but you will not hear that music anywhere in romania apart from cultural radio/tv programs . . 
   is it something people actually listen or it 's something people usually listen only after they get exhausted from the [ current romanian musical porn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luwgu5zhvai ) , 
  for me catalunya means [ la flama - obrint pas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7npvfqn2hhi ) ( but i think it 's better if you remain part of spain ), 
  lmao , that guy scouts even when he plays the accordion . . 
  thanks for the [ great music . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipjt_2as0ac ), 
  i 'd add [ maria tanase - lume , lume ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79qvepebrwa ), 
  [ your turn western europe . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtb2s_8vtg4 ), 
  we could try but the human resource quality kind of went to shit in the last 6-7 centuries to be honest . . 
  nah , usually the russians kick in right before we take off ... damn these ruskies always preventing us from world domination . 
  word . . 
  whoa . . that was well done . 
  congrats , you have a beautiful country . 
  [ who the fuck is bono ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qf4hmhwj_uo?t=22 ) did he graduate at west point or something ? 
  what 's next , lady gaga making economic forecasts ? 
  most of the old ( traditional ) houses in the region are built from wood on stone foundation because wood and stone is abundant in the area ( romania in general and transilvania in special lays around forested mountains ) . 
  the churches in the rest of romania are built as usual , from stone but in transilvania which was under catholic hungarian and austrian domination for a long period , the orthodox romanians were not allowed to build churches of stone ( nor schools ) so they built them from wood . 
  so i guess that 's how they became good at it . . 
  careful with the hungarian census . . from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_transylvania#austro-hungarian_empire ) : the census system in hungary between 1880 and 1910 was based on native language . 
  before 1880 , jews were counted as an ethnic group ; later , they were counted according to their first language ( magyar ) . 
   there should rightly have been a compromise between the two countries , an exchange of populations between north and south fuck off . 
  if the romanian army had n't entered transilvania , the hungarians would have compromised nothing . 
  they had [ enough chances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_memorandum ) to compromise but they could n't care less because they had big ass empire illusions . 
  when you are the king of the hill you do n't give a shit and when you lose the hill you want compromise ? 
  be serious . 
  they should be happy romania did n't keep the tisza fields as it was initially promised . 
  dude , do n't kill my joke with facts :d, 
  thank you . 
  [ maramures ] ( http://www.romanianmonasteries.org/maramures/maramures-geography ) is an interesting region of romania . 
  do n't hesitate to visit if you have the occasion . 
  it 's no surprise , given the romanians do n't have much knowledge about the effective military situation in europe . 
  france has a bigger/better army ( + nukes ! ), 
  than germany and some interests in romania . . but our relation with france is way colder in reality than in the collective romanian imagination ( see the friendly [ sarkozy-basescu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxa-9l4ciz0 ) relationship ) . 
  france is also quite unreliable vs russia . 
  damn , that 's a lot of ice to protect there . . 
   changed his name to louis cachet . 
  lol , that 's a good name . . iirc it 's pronounced like [ `` cach\u00e9 '' ] ( https://translate.google.com/?source=gtx_c#fr/en/cach%c3%a9 ) . . 
  beautiful church . 
  it reminds me of [ our wooden churches ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=wooden+churches+romania&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=652&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ), 
  what 's the `` official explanation '' ? 
  i kind of doubt the current ceta will open the gates for canadian richness to flood the eu ( and implicitly romania ) . 
  i have a feeling ( based on what i 've read , but ca n't remember the details now ) that ceta is actually more favorable to canada and less to eu . 
  so i think i prefer to remain ceta poor . 
  i know , and it sucks for us . . not that all the romanians are saints . . but ~ 18 millions of people are stigmatized for the deeds of less than 1.5 million of gypsies which are not even related to us apart from the passport . 
  in 10 years the number of gypsies living in romania will be insignificant but i bet everybody will still call the gypsies as `` romanians '' even if they will live and breed in other countries now . 
  not cool . 
  they should be named `` roaming indians '' because that 's what they are and that 's where they originally come from . 
  and probably we should change the name of the fucking country . . we still have representative alternatives . . like dacia or carpathia or whatever . . 
  i doubt he 's your [ romani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) friend . . maybe romanian . . and i think i know why you do n't want to give visas to `` romani '' . . 
  i am all smiles and gratefulness  but you see , they are not `` our filth '' ( technically it 's india 's filth . . ) . 
  apparently , the gypsies always wanted to reach sweden but they got stuck in the central & eastern european bureaucracy for ~ 300 years . . but it 's over now . 
  they are free and finally can tap into their god given potential . . 
  i think we can impose visas on sweden now . 
  ah ok , i see . . it 's about taxes . 
  but why do n't they use an offshore ? 
  ( with an offshore there 's no liquidity problem and also you do n't have to pretend you like all these artistic horrors ), 
   doing what picasso did in his time is insane you probably wanted to say `` picasso in his time was insane '' . 
  or incredibly clever , bluffing his way for the thrils of rich snobs of the world . . 
  i still ca n't decide yet . 
  in paris there is this big building with 3 floors and a basement full of garbage of which some garbage is `` unfinished '' because at some point that nut-head got lazy and did n't even try that hard any more . 
  and sure thing he has influence ; up to this day , kids in kindergartens all over the world struggle to reach his high bar of ludicrosity with senseless paintings and wire sculptures but they still ca n't come even close to that ground breaking `` enema with ink on a wall '' level of absurdity . 
  nah , i would argue that gold is way better than art . 
  less fragile , divisible , easily recognizable , widely accepted ( = more value stability ) , harder to counterfeit . . 
  fair enough , everyone does what they want with their money . . 
  i can understand gold as a store for value . 
  gold is rare and people in general ( not only the rich ) traditionally regard it as valuable , but the paintings ? 
  paintings and art in general is not that rare ( i could paint some of picasso 's `` works '' with a pen in my ass ) . 
  paintings are artificially rare ( like the diamonds ? ), 
  only because some people arbitrarily decide which of the old paintings have `` value '' . 
  for example this painting is `` valued at 120 million '' ( the budget of an average city for 10 years ) . 
  normally something is priced according to how much someone is willing to pay . . but not paintings and art . . because reasons . 
  you could argue that when you buy art , you buy prestige . . but the private art collectors in general are quite `` private '' . 
  nobody seems to have met one . 
  there must be a trick . . 
  impressive diversity you have there sweden !, 
  good luck with that multi-kulti , 
   while the gallery has estimated the price at 120 million , it said that if would likely fetch far more if auctioned given the rarity of caravaggio paintings . 
   `` when two rembrandts are bought for 80 million , they are sensational paintings , but rembrandt is far less rare . 
  the catalogue of rembrandt is between 350 to 400 paintings , while that of caravaggio is between 50 and 60 . 
  if you miss a rembrandt , it 's a shame but you can hope to have another opportunity to buy one . 
  if you miss a caravaggio , you can rule out having another chance . '' are the billionaires stupid in general or is there some sort of scam or money laundering around these art collections ? 
  `` women and children first ? '', 
  what 's that ? 
  did n't you see titanic ? 
  who would be that stupid to be the last ? 
  it 's free for all here . . / s edit : [ by the way . . this is how it 's done ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slknp5mjasi ), 
  hey , that looks familiar !, 
  we used to make jokes about queues in communist romania . . question : why do they build the commercial stores at least 5km apart from each other ? 
  answer : to prevent the queues from mixing up . . 
  oh , common ... it was n't `` you '' . . it was the other `` you '' . 
  you know which one . . no offense .
