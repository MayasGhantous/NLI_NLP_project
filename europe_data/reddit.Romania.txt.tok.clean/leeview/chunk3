  it was justified by `` whatcha gon na do about it ? 
  hon hon. . '', 
   france has always needed to import foreign wines , which are later sold by french companies at higher prices to the domestic and international markets . 
  it 's true that france imported its largest amount of spanish wine last year , but that 's because there is a need and french companies are making big profits from it . 
  that 's why i 'm not going to buy `` french '' wine . 
  why are n't the french producers protesting against these french speculators who actually sell the spanish wine with french labels instead of causing damages to the spanish producers ? 
  because it 's much easier to blame the spanish for invented reasons right ? 
  what can they do ? 
  today you blame the spanish , yesterday it was the romanians with their `` horse meat scandal '' ( even though the actual fraud was done by the `` wow romanians are so corrupt '' dutch ) . 
  the small players take the damages while the big ones make the profits . . fuck the hypocrisy . 
  this bullshit is unfair . . 
  i 'm currently living in france and after i saw what they did with the spanish wine i better punch myself in the nuts than touch a single drop of french wine . . fuck the fucking protectionism for fuck 's sake . . mais ca m ` enerve !, 
  i heard it called like that by older computer users . . 
  being from the romance family , kind of puts you in the top 5 by default . . 
  personally i heard only good things about portugal ( beautiful cities like porto , faro . . good food ) and the only portuguese i have ever met ( we worked for the same french company ) was very friendly and approachable . 
  and i like the sound of your language . . ( many foreign people who hear romanian for the first time think it resembles portuguese - probably because we also use a lot of `` sh '' and `` ch '' . . ), 
  omg , please annex us !!, 
  :d just kidding , i hope you enjoy your stay in romania . 
  dude , they pickpocketed the `` o '' . . 
  oh poor guy , here have an up vote and try better next time :d ( honestly , i got the joke from the beginning  ), 
  personally i 'm quite curious to know who ordered and exactly what happened in transnistria and beyond . 
  in romania there is no dispute that antonescu should have not killed nor persecuted anyone and should have not made one step beyond dniester river . . but i do n't know what was his logic and what were the circumstances . . was he able to refuse attacking the soviets like the finns did ? 
  what would have happened if he refused ? 
  ( for example after `` we made peace '' with the soviets we did n't have the option to refuse participation to the war against germany through hungary and czechoslovakia and no one asks why , because it was evident : nobody would have dared to refuse stalin ) what i 'm sure is that both antonescu and hitler perceived the communism like a great expansionist threat and they were not wrong . 
  antonescu got in power through a coup ( possible with german help ) during some messy political times and while he had the popular support for retaking moldova , i 'm quite sure he did n't have the popular support for any policy of extermination so it 's not very fair to hold the entire country responsible for the deeds of a dictator imposed by hitler . 
  also he was `` prioritizing plunder over killing , showing leniency toward most jews in the old kingdom , and ultimately refusing to adopt the final solution '' . 
  yeah , milka whole nuts and then this [ little fucker ] ( http://www.lindt.fr/shop/creation-delice-pistache ) will ruin my waist and arteries . . 
  wow , that escalated quickly ... :d, 
  actually the polish and romanian people/workers meet a lot in western europe now , and get to `` rediscover each other '' and how similar we are from some points of view . 
  i had a polish girl in my team in france . 
  she was competent and a cool person overall . 
  yes , after seeing what happened to poland , the french , our main allies , being shattered in several weeks and having the soviet troops invading moldova ( then part of romania ) . . we decided to not push our luck against hitler ( [ who was relying heavily on the romanian oil ] ( https://youtu.be/oet1wag5sfk?t=509 ) ) and to go on the wrong side of the battle fighting with one evil against the other hoping to recover moldova in the process . 
  i think [ this is the main issue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bystroye_canal ) . 
   in 1997 , ukraine was left without its own deep-water canal between the danube and the black sea . 
   the use of romanian sulina canal costs ukraine 0.7-1 .2 million uah annually there was also this incident : https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock_ ( nav % c4 % 83 ) where the ukrainians were suspected to have intentionally sunk a ship in the sulina channel to make it unusable . . 
  these kind of opinions are born in the very rare occasions when some ukrainian politician or public figure makes some `` unpolite '' declarations about romania/romanians and they get reflected in the romanian mass media . 
  apart from that , ukraine is very rarely covered in romanian mass media ( it 's really like we have a big ghostly neighbor of which we know and hear little ; especially for us living in transilvania ) . 
  so the only things many romanians know about ukraine is that you want to redirect the flow of danube to kiev and that your parliament is [ part time ufc arena ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rada+brawl ) . 
   should have called it `` land of mein '' they could have went all the way and called it `` mein camp '' . . [ and speaking of mein land . . the obligatory rammstein - kind of nsfw ] ( https://youtu.be/g0fa1z8plyk?t=213 ), 
  the poll is not so much about active feelings like `` love/hate '' as much about passive feelings like `` trust/distrust '' and `` prejudice '' . . the text says : `` i will read you a list of countries . 
  please specify for each what 's your feeling about them '' blue = rather positive , red = rather negative , green = i do n't know , i do n't respond, 
  yeah , i 'm also romanian , from oradea , and i have an honorary degree in `` hungarian insults , curses and blasphemy '' ( or something like that ; i do n't remember well , baszd meg ) . . 
   you guys invaded ukraine together with the nazis no grudges here either . . just a little detail of history ( our pov ) : we invaded ukraine in 1941 ( actually we invaded soviet union of which ukraine happened willy-nilly to be part of ) after `` you guys invaded '' moldova in 1940 together with the bolsheviks . 
  other romanian lands occupied then , like northern bukovina & herta region were not returned to this day ( although they still have a romanian/moldovan majority or significant minority ) . 
  i know the russian version of history talks a lot about the romanian abuses in ww2 ( and some are true , some are propaganda as usual ) but they willingly fail to tell you that after your nation experienced the thrills of communism ( including holodomor ) for ~ 20 years , they were not so upset to be invaded by romanians and nazis ( and many ukrainians had good hopes , but unfortunately hitler was an insane slavophobe ) . 
  the collaborationists were not stupid and they were more than the russian propaganda will ever admit ( because at that point almost anything looked better than bolsheviks/stalin and their `` break the fabric of society '' doctrine and the traditional russian diplomacy of `` it does not matter if they hate you as long as they fear you '' ) . 
  edit : oh , a downvote !, 
  omg the bolsheviks are alive and have internet now !!, 
  short answer : 16 % -20 % of romanians have mixed feelings towards moldovans mostly because many moldovans seemed ( at least until several years ago ) quite brainwashed by russian propaganda regarding their history and identity and also the communist party ( evidently pro-moscow ) is alive and well in moldova and many from the older generations still vote for it . 
  wait what ? 
  did they just call us . . 
  [ oh kurwa . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-bgrekkjcg ), 
  lobbying . . greed . . the european capital smells the american way of making big money and they want it too . . profit above ethics , above law , above environment , profit above all, 
  you should give them [ pula ] ( https://translate.google.com/#ro/en/pula ) though ... 
  seeing how eagerly are some politicians and shareholders pushing us to become `` more like us '' . . 
  i 'm afraid we will follow . 
  netherlands will veto you until you give them dubrovnik for `` administration '' ( or do you have other assets in need of a `` strategic investor '' ? ) . 
  if you do n't give presents to the dutch . . you are obviously corrupt and not schengen worthy . . tldr ; the dutch are dix . 
  it does not make sense what you say . 
  economy , industry and technology is part of the military potential but without a good army , the military potential is low to zero , no matter how much money you have . 
  germany has a strong economy , industry and technology but a very weak army today . 
  france has a strong army today and the industry and technology is quite good ; the only weak point is the economy but compared to russia , french economy is `` quite good '' . 
  if you want to make guesstimates about who in europe would fare better against the russians , check some [ informed opinions ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-europe.asp ) before . . 
  i think you greatly overestimate the german army and underestimate the french one . . 
  when was the last time an irish bought something ( a frigate ? 
  from bae ? 
  tesco on the other hand , they see it daily . . no surprise here . 
   hungary - livejasmin lol , for years i thought livejasmin might be romanian because many faces there looked like romanian girls . . but i never stopped to investigate that annoying pop-up . . 
  i was usually in a hurry to other `` more generous '' sites . . 
  wtf you want to say about romania ? 
  `` treatment of children and gypsies and corruption . . '' it kind of worked unless you want us to make disappear the gypsies . . 
  nice spin . 
  i 'm so glad the tax avoiding thieves exist only in russia , syria and other third world countries . 
  i 'm relieved . 
  i can go back to work now . 
  yep , officially we claim latin/daco-roman heritage even if technically the `` daco-roman blood '' might be quite diluted after so many migrant ( more or less ) tribes passing through the area left big impressions in the gene pool . 
  the language , on the other hand , is undoubtedly romance/latin . 
  thanks for the intro . 
  it 's an interesting subject . 
  you have a long history but your population is rather small . . 
  i guess the armenians like to emigrate a lot ( oh , the kardashians !!! ) . 
  we have/had a small [ armenian minority in romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenians_of_romania ) . . and the only two armenian politicians i know in the romanian parliament ( pambuccian and vosganian ) are rather competent which is rare . 
  not so many brits i guess . . but there are italians , at least in the western part of romania , and often we read that some of them are actually camorra or n'drangheta fugitives staying low in the cozy romania ( the language and culture is similar and it 's probably easier for them to accommodate then in many other places ) . 
  what would be the brief history of the armenian language/alphabet ? 
  ( i 'm too lazy to search wikipedia now . . sorry ), 
  yep , [ planned obsolescence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planned_obsolescence ) . 
  the target life span of a cheap car these days seems to be around 15 years . 
  the french cars are known to wear off faster than other brands but unfortunately even vw is not what it used to be . . 
  nice , i like your national guards ' uniforms . . 
  from my detached perspective , the hungarians wanted rights for themselves but denied them for the others . . the rest is just lots of `` if only this and if only that '' . 
  nothing really prevents hungary now more than then from being a great country like netherlands , switzerland or other small but rich ( austria !! ), 
  and rather powerful countries but it 's much too tempting to blame the current not-so-greatness on trianon and the neighbors who did n't want to live in the good ol' 1867-1918 austria-hungary where some were equals and [ others tolerated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_memorandum ) . . 
  so what happened ? 
  the serbian border police lost the appetite for money or what ? 
  i thought there were no clean border police in eastern/southeastern europe . . are you really `` the clean ones '' ? 
  what the heck is wrong with the erasmus buses ? 
  one crashed recently in catalunya , now in italy . . bizarre coincidence ? 
  also in italy , a story that kind of left me with contradictory feelings : an italian guy abandoned his romanian long time girlfriend on the highway in the middle of the night after a quarrel and she was struck and killed by another car while she was walking home on the side of the highway . . ugly tragedy . 
  the guy is suicidal now . 
  judging by the rate at which we `` externalize '' the `` structural poor problem '' aka gypsies to western europe , our gdp/capita is going to skyrocket in the following decade . . while theirs is going to plummet :d,
