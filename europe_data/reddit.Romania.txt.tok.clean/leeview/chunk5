  romania saved more [ polish refugees , troops and gold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_bridgehead ) but hey . . 
  i do n't want to ruin your bromance , 
  are you sure hungary saved the polish gold ? 
  [ from wikipedia  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_bridgehead )  the romanian government also received the treasury of the national bank of poland in 1939 . 
  one part of it , consisting of 1,261 crates containing 82,403 kg of gold , was loaded aboard a commercial ship in the port of constan\u021ba , and transported to western europe . 
  us capital is heavily invested in western eu economy since ww2 . 
  us troops usually follow the us capital and protect it from confiscation , nationalization or other `` funny ideas '' these socialists in europe might have ... 
  probably the `` romanian asterix '' would be humbled enough by history to not go that far . . but some people just like to make wild speculations and overestimate the role of their ancestors . 
  afaik the `` proto-romanian -  latin '' hypothesis has very few proponents and is not very known nor taken very seriously around here . 
  if we lower enough our critical thinking , romania and poland could be considered the `` origin '' of everything in europe . . because almost every migrating tribe in europe crossed poland or romania at one point and therefore `` it was romanian or polish for a brief moment '' . . right ? 
  ( yes no ? ), 
  in romanian . . and it 's used to `` rhetorically ask for an obvious confirmation '' . . 
  whoa , catchy song and beautiful girl . 
  the magyars and the slavs are the only `` theoretical possibilities '' so i explicitly mentioned both . 
  afaik no one claims romania is magyar ; at most , some hungarians claim that some of the romanians in transilvania are in fact romanized hungarians . 
  there are indeed some romanians with names of hungarian origin like farcas from hungarian farkas meaning `` wolf '' and some of these people might indeed be assimilated hungarians but there is also a second possibility of romanian names like the common `` lupu '' ( wolf ) [ being magyarized to ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization#the_magyarization_of_personal_names ) `` farkas '' during the hungarian administration of transilvania and the owner did n't change it later when the administration went to romanians . 
  my family 's name , which has no meaning neither in romanian nor in hungarian language ( therefore could n't be translated ) , was written with hungarian characters in the official id documents during the brief hungarian administration of north transilvania ( 1940-1945 ) and later my grandparents reverted it back to romanian characters . 
  also the name of my father in law ( born in 1942 ) was recorded as `` lorincz '' in the papers even if his parents named him `` florian '' . 
   i come from central europe you mean eastern europe ? 
  bahahahaha . . just kidding , i did n't resist , please shoot me :(, 
   1 out of every 200 males is related to genghis khan ( so related to mongols ) , that is 5 % - of the population 1 out of 200 is 0.5 out of 100 . . and i 'm pretty sure that 's called `` 0.5 % '' so 0.5 % of males is ~ 0.25 % of the entire population ( if the number of males ~ = number of females ), 
  oh , the influence is real . . and i do n't think there is that much denial about it in romania . . but it 's only influence . 
  no matter how you look at it ( linguistically , genetically , culturally ) , romania is an `` original mix '' of influences and particularities and it 's definitely not slavic nor magyar at it 's core . 
  interesting indeed and i have no doubt spain has some great tomato producers too but to me it looks like the quality experienced by the buyers depends a lot on the producer picked by the selling chain . 
  i guess some chains simply prefer the producers able to provide cheap tomatoes resilient to transportation and in big quantities . . therefore the taste is not so important to them . 
  first , imho these are uninhibited and ( expectedly ) childish answers . 
  pupils in many other eu countries would not fare much better . 
  second , this is what happens when you go too quickly from one extreme : strict education with plenty of punishment ( including abusive physical and psychical punishment ) common `` when our grandparents were kids '' to another extreme : ( low ) education with basically no punishment , or sometimes , no education at all because `` no kid left behind '' . 
  i do n't intend to bash indiscriminately the spanish farmers/producers but the most tasteless tomatoes i have ever bought in france ( lidl , auchan , carrefour ) were `` origin : espagne '' . 
  even worse were the strawberries . 
  not only they had little or no `` strawberry taste '' but the taste of chemicals/pesticides was overwhelming ( i 'm not a particularly sensitive nor a picky person but i do n't think i was able to swallow one ) . 
  i have to admit they had usually the lowest price . 
  after being fooled in at least two separate occasions , i will definitely not touch a spanish strawberry `` casserole '' ever again no matter how well they will look . 
  ah , the famous `` arrest me like one of your french girls '' . . 
  sometimes i worry that all that cheese i eat is interfering with my dna and one morning i will just start to moooo and shit all over the place . . 
  and btw , why is libya sitting on our oil ? 
    and i do not believe that a european community of 500 million is incapable of integrating several million more refugees , even in an era of slow growth . 
  what a freaking moron talking about his `` beliefs '' because moving millions should be based on journalists ' beliefs . . 
   will concentrate will ~ ~ concentrate ~ ~ focus, 
  do n't worry . . 
  given enough time and interconnections , lots of stereotypes about eastern/southern europeans will fade away, 
   romanians , gypsies ... lol , fk off  , you mistake us for the `` indians '' who passed through our country towards your country for the last 2 - 3 hundreds of years , 
  i do n't think this kind of income is intended for non-citizens . . 
  oh man , you do n't know what a great mistake is to give beggars money . 
  in romania everyone knows that if you see a beggar ( we do n't really see them anymore , i wonder why ? ), 
  and it looks credibly hungry ( `` the legit beggar '' ) and in need , you buy him some ( small amount of ) food or you give some clothing that you do n't need but never give them money . 
  if someone 's a real beggar he will take anything you give joyfully , but the `` professional '' beggars will ask for money only and some act incredibly rude if you do n't give them `` enough '' . 
  i witnessed so many rude and condescending romanian speaking gypsies ( saying unimaginable obscenities towards people who would not give them money ) begging in france that i wanted to furiously strangle some with my bare hands . 
  uhm . . yeah , but think about all that freedom and democracy . . 
  with those money you will learn to live tight . . welcome to eastern europe , 
  knowing their geography , i would guess they have plenty of dams like romania . . 
  i 'm more tempted to believe that while he was in europe , he knowingly or unknowingly associated himself with some dubious persons from pakistani diaspora and some secret services had him or others from this group under surveillance . 
  in the light of the latest events , his presence in europe might be considered `` risky enough '' . 
  i see your `` donde esta la biblioteca '' and i raise you a '' [ \u00bf que hora es ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6-vm1oiuow ) '', 
  oh man , look at those deadly beams . . the japanese were always ahead of their times . . 
  because politics is shitty . . 
  i foresee a political slogan : `` we need a national enema ! '', 
  you are missing the point . . 
  he probably signed for the first quota ... fixed quota . . but `` planned quota '' is different . . 
  i do n't know , i do n't hate the man , i do n't love him . . but sometimes he does some things which seem right and then we cheer , because why not . . , 
  vona gabor is that you ?? 
  looks good , 6 months apprentice to ponta and he could bend steel beams with his lies ... like a true master . 
  lol , yeah , we could romanize him . . he already spends some time yearly in transilvania . 
  i do n't know the internal politics of hungary ( and i 'm sure it 's stinky like everywhere ) but having the balls to go against the wave from day one instead of compromising with the disingenuous talking heads in bruxelles . . that 's a strong point in my book . 
  in my experience the males can take one straight in the face and still stand even after several beers , but it 's a good excuse to start a drunken fight . . 
  not if it was an onion loaded burp !, 
  those deadly gases can fell a young female from 1 meter . . 
  i do n't know man , beaks in butt-holes . . not really my thing . . and `` even the egyptians did it '' does not sound like a strong argument if my wife catches me with a parrot in my ass . 
  well you ca n't blame the man for riding the best looking horse from his stable . . 
  because even 0.01 % of an infinite number of immigrants is infinite ... got it ? 
  i do n't want infinite number of immigrants , i want at most 1000 a year . 
  i think the quotas are being negotiated after or at least i do n't know them . . 
  if you ask about my quota . . then i would say something along the lines of what our ex-president said : romania has its own natural pace of assimilating people from other cultures ( except people from moldova which we do n't consider foreign ) and he had some statistics for the last 20-30 years . . and iirc it was under 1000 persons per year . 
  we also have the unhappy case with the gypsies which are living in romania for hundreds of years and still we were n't able to assimilate . 
  i think it would be unwise to create another `` gypsy '' minority and new ghettos . 
  nope , the context is `` planned quotas '' . 
  like if eu receives 1million refugees then 5 % go to this country , 7 % to that , 1 % the other and so on . 
  it 's a `` carte blanche '' for an unknown/unlimited number of immigrants . 
  similar expression in romanian is `` frectie la piciorul de lemn '' ( massaging a wooden leg ) . 
  ah man , we are going to burn some karma here . . :d this karma thing is censoring people worse than the communist regime , 
  i thought everyone had one . . the word not the procedure . . 
  in romanian the medical term is `` clisma '' ( enema ) . 
  i think google translate is anti-magyar chauvinist !, 
  how can i apply for hungarian citizenship ? 
  yes , i agree , romania is one of the poorest countries in europe and transnistria is in top 1 poorest and indebted countries in europe . 
  but that 's fine , we never needed more russian minorities in romania , we only wanted the romanians . 
   its unclear how many from the previous people still inhabited middle-earth , when the couple of magyars arrived . 
  do you have reliable sources/estimations about these wars , the approximate size of the invading tribes and of the locals ? 
  because it 's too convenient to assume that wars kill everything on such large territory compared to the numbers of invaders ( even during the later and more deadly [ mongol invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_europe#invasion_of_the_kingdom_of_hungary ) , only 20 % -40 % of the population died , by slaughter or epidemic ) . 
  the wars usually do n't involve the women , kids , elders and after all these invasions i would assume many locals learned to live in inaccessible places like mountains and to avoid large communities until later when they had fortresses . 
  even today if you take a compact group of 50k all men on horses and you ask them to cover the surface of only transilvania and touch/kill everyone they find , without a map or gps . . you will see that in practice it 's a much harder problem ( and today we have modern roads for orientation . . ) and i do n't take into account the logistics of moving large numbers of people and horses in areas where communities are scarce and food is not everywhere to just take it . 
   they were technologically advanced than the previous inhabitants , so in exchange for technology i 'm curious to know what is this special technology these nomads carried with them ? 
   pre-wallach locals probably received the advanced technology from the roman empire still lurking around ( / s ) , and thats why we love our own language and national identity . 
  it 's not very scientific to assume that some nomadic people just had `` advanced technology '' and others had to receive it from someone else . 
  i 'm curious if you have links explaining . . 
  lets just hope that what she did in syria , stays in syria . . 
  i do n't care much about this patch of land but i think it 's not fair to keep losing territory and people to ukraine and russia . 
  transnistria is 30 % moldovans and they should have the chance to choose their country without intimidation from the others especially since many live in relatively compact regions of transnistria . 
  if this is not possible , then transnistria should be exchanged with ukraine for other ex-romanian territories where romanians/moldovans are still a majority .
