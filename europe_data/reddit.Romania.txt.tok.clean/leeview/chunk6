   the area forms an official ` language border ' ( so , like , the official signs in that area will be in hungarian and you should adress people in hungarian when you go there ) for our nationalists ' discomfort it is . . 
  the road signs and public information is bilingual in romania wherever there is a minority larger than 20-25 % iirc . 
  szekely land kind of goes to the extreme because apparently there are many citizens there who never learned romanian so sometimes even the romanians ca n't speak to them . 
  i think there is more truth in what you say than we are ready to accept . 
  i do n't want to deny the right to ethnicity to our hungarian friends but i think lots of people when they read that `` this tribe conquered this and that '' they assume that the migrant tribe was outnumbering those who they were conquering and from then on , the conquered were either wiped from the face of earth or they left for other places and we can discount them from the gene pool and history only because their language and name is n't predominant anymore . 
  also imagine what it means for a big tribe of lets say 50.000-100 .000 people ( the size of a small town ) `` to conquer '' a land like carpathian basin . . which would be the size of hungary and transilvania together ( with a current population of 17 ~ 18millions ) with a population [ around year 1000 of lets say 5 millions ~ = population of austria-hungary then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medieval_demography ) . 
  50.000-100 .000 people can barely assimilate a county in that region . 
  yes this tribe managed to conquer the centers of power in that land and to impose their language on most people . . but to assimilate or wipe all the pre-existing migrants ? 
  i doubt it . 
  i 'm open to constructive criticism of my theory . 
  so if we got this far , what 's the consensus in russia about what happened in 1989 in eastern europe and romania in particular ? 
  what 's the most probable version and what is the craziest ? 
  thanks, 
  i have to admit i do n't have the time to search for the most credible sources . 
  romania was for many years a land of smoke and mirrors where the population was kept chasing diversions and `` terrorists '' because the people in power were the second echelon of the communist party ( even today the largest party , psd and the largest tv station chain , antena , is under influence or direct control of ex hard core communists ) and they did n't want to reveal what really happened . 
  but step by step and after enough time passed there were more and more direct witnesses coming forward with details and arguments . 
  general stanculescu talked but still keeps many things for himself . 
  also there was the last soldiers who guarded and later shot ceausescu who described some aspects . 
  there are some analysis of what really happened to the last meeting in 21 december 1989 etc. 
  most of these materials are tv talk shows . 
  it 's possible . 
  i do n't have strong data to know what was killed and what was left but i can tell you a pattern that can be observed in transilvania even today and you interpret it how you want . 
  the hills and mountains are inhabited almost exclusively by romanians with the notable exceptions of szeklers and [ saxons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons ) who were settled in some mountainous areas intentionally . 
  the planes are a mix of almost exclusively romanian ( more ) and almost exclusively hungarian ( fewer ) villages and rather few villages with mixed populations . 
  the cities are mixed and used to have a greater proportion of hungarians than they have today . 
  this changed mostly because many of romanians migrated to cities ( due to communist industrialization ) and many hungarians left romania especially after 1989 . 
  how would you interpret this pattern ? 
  i guess kgb will not admit the assassination of a leader of state . 
  which academia could have hard proof about who , where and when it was decided that ceausescu should be killed in a fake trial instead of just being deposed of power and tried for various accusations and kept in prison ? 
  what is known is that there was a group of apparently well coordinated `` revolutionaries '' who gathered in the first moments when ceausescu left `` comitetul central '' , and started to act like the new leaders and chiefs of army . 
  at least one of them ( iirc militaru ) was seen and heard calling to moscow and informed them about the situation . 
  the army captured ceausescu and for 3 days kept him hidden in a military base and then shot him after a show trial . 
  the group shown in the trial video does not want to tell who took the decision to kill ceausescu but they admit the decision was taken by `` that group and others '' for some ridiculous reason ( they were afraid that other units of the army or `` terrorists '' were going to liberate him ) . 
  if this group is known to be linked to kgb and gru , ca n't we deduce that they did n't kill ceausescu before at least obtaining some feedback from their handlers at moscow ? 
  they did n't kill him by accident . 
  it was deliberate and later it was shown that the commander of the military base even wanted to stage the killings as friendly fire ( the btr-80 transporting ceausescu was about to be shot by others ) but they changed the plans . 
  do n't take it too personally . 
  i changed small bits after i submitted my message but you got the initial version . 
  the russian jews with romanian names were predominant earlier ( 1945 ~ 1960 ) and apparently brucan was not russian . 
  nicolae militaru it 's not quite up to debate . 
  he was the source of at least one deadly disinformation and he started to replace the heads of the army with suspect pro-ussr people from the first minute he got the power . 
  gorbacev was not needed to intervene but he was informed from day 1 of the `` revolution '' . 
   oh man that 's a new one . 
  now it 's the kgb that killed him !, 
  what else , they stole all of his gold too ? 
  it 's no joke , all the heads of `` the revolution '' and the people who took control after , were known kgb or gru collaborators or people with close ties to ussr ( some of them were jews with romanian names like [ silviu brucan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silviu_brucan ) ) . 
  that 's why at least one of them , [ nicolae militaru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_militaru ) , immediately after he seized the power , he ordered the ambush of some unit led by two officers who previously worked in counter-informations ( anti-spy unit ) and handled nicolae militaru 's file and knew he was a spy . 
  ceausescu was shot because he knew that all these guys were traitors and foreign agents and he even said it during that fake judicial process ( it 's on film ) . 
  it 's all your fault , 
  russians happen to be attacked in convenient places especially before a russian attack . . it 's always those idiot nationalists who do n't know what will happen if you attack the russian mps . 
  this story is getting old . 
  `` russia did n't want to split a part of moldova and keep it 's army in that place to control the area . 
  it was those nationalists that forced russia . . '' . 
  how old are you ? 
   and did n't your country become independent via armed revolt and a show trial ? 
  no , it was already independent . 
  too independent . 
  that 's why people with kgb connections organized a coup-d'etat and shot that independent minded tyrant . 
  i 've just noticed that `` in soviet transnistria the people in the news have better teeth then the anchorman '' . . well , never mind , they all have kinda bad teeth but the kids are beautiful . 
   ` the president ' is ` presedintele ' in romanian , but no , for them is ` prezidentul ' that 's because in moldovian ` prezidentul ' is a neologism from english . . 
  they warned you , it 's a different language . . :-) joke apart , to me it does not sound `` arhaic '' . . it 's more like the romanian spoken in ( our ) moldovan villages . . 
  in transnistria there was no `` they '' with a unique voice and will to break away from moldova . 
  it was `` they with guns '' and `` the rest '' . 
  a legitimate independence is not rightfully gained even when armed militias put urns in your face and ask you to vote for `` your independence '' but you do n't know that in russia . 
  i do n't want to understand your point of view anymore , maybe because i understand it too well . 
  if there are russian citizens or ethnics living in lands that never belonged to russia , you annex the land `` because russian people '' . 
  if the land belonged to russia sometimes ( no matter when and how it was acquired ) , you annex the people `` because russian land '' ( even if the russians are a minority or do n't want to be annexed ) . 
  long story short : your government annexes everything it can and then finds a pretext . 
  thanks but no . 
  i do n't care if your government convinced you that it 's fair what it does . 
  romania ( re ) offers romanian citizenship to all the people from moldova ( including transnistria and apparently also romanian territories lost to ukraine ) who : 1 ) had romanian citizenship by birth or adoption but they unwillingly lost it ( for exemple when moldova was `` eliberated '' by the soviets ) 2 ) are descendants of people who qualified for 1 ) up to grade 3 of relationship ( grandparents ) [ translated from here ] ( http://chisinau.mae.ro/node/264 ) : redob\u00e2ndirea cet\u0103\u0163eniei rom\u00e2ne art . 
  if in 1992 transnistria returned to ukraine from where it was carved or if it were occupied by ukrainian troops at the demand of the ~ 30 % ukrainians living there , i would have nothing to say about the situation . 
  but it was occupied by the russian federation and used against moldova 's real independence and today they consider using it even against ukraine . 
  i do n't believe in 1989 [ 40 % of transnistrian moldovans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_census_in_transnistria ) preferred russia instead of moldova nor that 28 % transnistrian ukrainians did n't want to return to ukraine . 
  you mistake the desires of transnistrians with the desires of the regime that leads them . 
  what we call today transnistria was born in 1991 when the `` transnistrian rebels '' which were in fact the [ 14th soviet army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_army_involvement_in_transnistria ) and mercenaries from soviet union ( see donbas recipe ) , took control of a region of moldova . 
  if you believe in that context they had free democratic elections in transnistria or the elected leaders represent first the interests of the trasnistrian people , we agree to disagree and that 's it . 
  exactly . 
  that 's how the russians play with their disobeying neighbors and that 's how they exploit a region and keep it underdeveloped and dependent on them while pretending it 's all about `` independence '' . 
  the common transnistrians have no clue what debts their leaders accumulate in their name and how underdeveloped they remain due to this political chess . 
  all they know is bullshit about `` romanian fascists wanting to invade them '' probably to pay their debts and pensions . . 
  yes , they get benefits from russia but they also use any advantage they get from `` de jure '' being part of moldova like moldovan passports , movement and recently exports in eu ( which are proving increasingly important ) . 
  also [ in 2004 , transnistria had debts of us$ 1.2 billion ( two-thirds of which are with russia ) which was per capita about six times higher than in moldova ( without transnistria ) . 
  in march 2007 the debt to gazprom for the acquisition of natural gas has increased to us$ 1.3 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) . 
  some of the russian `` financial support '' is held as debt to russia therefore if at some point transnistria really decides to go its own way , the russians ask repayment to all these debts . 
  you are welcome , 
  they did ( and it 's part of the mimicking ; probably they wanted to scare the ukrainians or the moldovans , who knows ) . 
  i bet you wonder why the russians did n't accept that kind of requests all these years ? 
  because transnistria is more useful as a bait for and parasite on moldova than a poor isolated russian province sucking all its needs from russia . 
  transnistria is a tool in the hand of the russian gov. 
  used to shape the foreign and internal policy of rep. of moldova ( russia wants moldova a client state and a buffer zone ) . 
  what `` transnistrians want '' is dictated from moscow ( directly to the transnistrian officials and to the public through propaganda ) . 
  sometimes transnistria wants to be in a federation with moldova but only if it has a disproportionate say in the future of this federation ( and probably if moldova pays transnistrian debts accumulated to gazprom ) . 
  if this does not work , then they want to be part of russia , because alone they ca n't really function if no one pays them subsidies . 
  so this is not independence , this is political blackmail . 
  also when transnistria `` gives signs of turning to the eu for help '' as some wrote not long ago , it 's because the russian money dried up recently and they were instructed from moscow to mimic negotiations with eu and to get some help from eu or moldova until the russian economy gets better and the russian subsidies comeback , and then you will read that transnistria plays again that limbo between moldova and russia . 
  it 's sad that transnistria still holds captive an [ important romanian/moldovan minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_census_in_transnistria ) which do n't have a say about their political future . 
  they want `` independence '' not independence . 
  transnistrian `` independence '' is very different from other independences like catalunya or scotland for example . 
  scheisse , das ist not fair . . way too good .
