  do n't get too greedy bulgaria , there are no bulgar minorities in northern dobrudja , only turks and tatars . 
  the `` conspiracy '' is out in the open and even has wikipedia pages with sources . 
  qatar is one actor sponsoring the rebels in syria and it has a pipe idea : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qatar-turkey_pipeline now just consider that another actor involved in the syrian conflict supporting assad is iran and it too has a favorite pipe : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran-iraq-syria_pipeline it 's just a coincidence and wars are `` rarely '' fought for economic reasons . . / s, 
  from what i understood , erdogan does it for saudi , qatar , european and us ( and of course turkish ) interests . 
  that 's why you will not hear much bad talk about it here . 
  syria is on the shortest and best path for [ gas pipes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_gas_in_qatar ) from qatar to turkey and opposes any pipes because the russians do n't want to lose the tight grip on the european gas consumers . 
  the companies who wanted to lay the pipes are as usual usa , eu and their middle eastern partners . 
  interesting plane . . we called it [ iar-93 vultur ( eagle ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iar-93_vultur ) in romania . 
  craiova also made a trainer version called [ iar-99 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic7otcwwld8 ) . 
  afaik the engines were the weakest link for these planes . 
  they were quite underpowered . 
  did serbia further develop j-22 ( new more powerful engines ? ), 
  or is it the original version ? 
  that 's actually quite a brilliant idea . . 
  the only risk is for the european space program to be derailed by some bunch of immigrants invading the [ spaceport ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/launchers/europe_s_spaceport/europe_s_spaceport2 ) imposing sharia law on the crews . 
  russia does not have that big balls to make a move like that and i do n't underestimate russia . 
  i think despite the apparent slowness of nato , once it starts there is no easy gain for russia no matter how many divisions are they going to sacrifice ( and i think they know it , that 's why they agitate disproportionately for every slow but irreversible nato move ) . 
  let me remind you that in 1939 romania was allied with poland and france . 
  after what happened to poland and later to france and mostly after the [ soviets occupied ( 1940 ) what is today republic of moldova ( bessarabia ) then part of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) , there were very few options for romania and none of them was `` allied with soviet union '' . 
  hitler [ badly needed ] ( https://youtu.be/oet1wag5sfk?t=455 ) the romanian oil fields . 
  so the options for romania were : 1 ) end up under german panzers like poland ( still better than under soviets ) 2 ) be friendly to germany and you might get bessarabia back ( even better ) . 
  i think you understand now how we became `` allies '' with hitler, 
   roma or romani is the name that their political and ngo organizations prefer and the name that we preferred they would n't use at all !!!, 
  in romania like in many eastern european countries they were called tzigani since always and it was so well associated with their identity and `` culture '' that it became a derogatory term . 
  now they are thrashing our name . 
  in less than 8 years of roaming through eu they managed to convince basically everyone that the romanians are thieves and beggars . 
  so much for political correctness . 
  i think they are second , after the catholic church . 
  ( no wonder the pope feels threatened . . ), 
  the friendly and [ `` unassuming '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svkgosr7puc ) atmosphere . . 
  hmm ... so how long since the last time you checked a map bro ? 
  :d . . just kidding . . no burn intended but we still have many reasons to stay modest . 
  now you had to ruin everything with your uninspired guessworks about me . 
  i will abstain from saying what i think about you although i have a good guess too . 
  ( [ also you might wan na check , sexism does not mean what you think it means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexism ) ), 
  i think you wanted to say italy is our bigger ( older ) sister . . and probably the french are our cousins who pretend they do n't know us anymore especially after they saw our gypsies . . 
  the spanish are cool though even if they are farther . 
  they are doing better enough to not have insecurities towards us and bad enough to not be arrogant . 
  hey hungary , you have hot women and so do we . . but i think we always secretly wished ours were as horny as yours . . 
  still , `` the fockers '' has a comic effect ( it sounds like `` the fuckers '' ) which is easily lost in direct translation . 
  so adaptation is needed . 
   yanis varoufakis is not exactly an unbiased source . 
  give me proof he 's lying . 
  at least he explained his point of view in that video with facts that can be checked . 
   also greece did heavily overspend . 
  this is not relevant to your argument . 
  give me proof the 100 billions were used in the interest of greece and not the interest of germany , like you said initially . 
  the interest of greece was to declare bankruptcy and restructure their debt , not to take additional debt . 
  the interest of german banks was to `` extend and pretend '' that greece can return them money which they obviously did n't have while their national income contracted ~ 25 % . 
  why would we make the effort to learn latin when almost everybody knows a little of the most spoken language of the world : bad english ? 
   that is why greece got bailed out with more than 100 billion euro [ just for your information ] ( https://youtu.be/cca68u3p_z8?t=1680 ) greece was not bailed out . 
  deutche bank , bnp paribas , societe generale and others were bailed out by germany using greece as an intermediary . 
  also you see that `` billions of euros every year are poured into eastern european infrastructure '' but you do n't want to see the same billions of euros coming back to western europe as payments to the western companies who win most contracts and also you fail to see that there are additional billions of euros borrowed by ee from we banks and are paid to we companies for the same infrastructure . 
  we does not subsidize 100 % of a project . 
  eastern europe gets new infrastructure but also gets new debts to western europe and keeps a lot of western companies and banks afloat . 
  you will be part of it one way or another . 
  danube corridor is important for central europe economies and a good chunk of it is in your yard . 
  if you are around szeged , szolnok or debrecen , you are quite close to western carpathians . 
  lots of hungarians go for skiing in [ arieseni ] ( http://www.arieseni.info/camera-web-vartop.html ) or hiking at [ padis ] ( https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=padis%2c%20romania ) and [ boga valley ] ( https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=boga%20valley ) . 
  the horses were bought from denmark at fat prices so shut up !, 
   do n't worry , the eu money do n't fuck around eastern europe for long . . they run back to their masters like cursed .

  how do people from serbia perceive the vlachs ? 
  do they know that the vlachs speak a language which is surprisingly similar to the romanian language ? 
  the only british girl i ever met was slightly overweight but had rather good teeth `` for a british '' . 
  i do n't want to think what that means with regards to other british women . 
  because it means nothing . 
  it 's the same for romanians . 
  maybe in 90 's , freshly out of the uniformization machine , which was the communism , we had some very visible and distinct ( behavioral ) traits , but those things are quietly fading away with the exception of the gypsies . 
  when he started doing his thing in 2009 he was quite original and funny and he introduced me to u picku materinu and jebem ti sunce . . so he 's a hero hands down , 
  no need to feel sorry for me `` dude '' :-) , other then nationality , i do n't have anything in common with the beggars or the criminals , never had and very likely never will . 
  and i feel responsible for what other romanians or gypsies do in eu as much as you feel responsible for those pedophile lords or those pakis molesting young girls in uk or even less . 
  it 's ok . no one cares about your rant either . 
  not the germany i know and like . 
  you know what i meant . 
   reduce the number of romanians and us citizens that move to germany if that would be the price to pay for germany to remain germany and not become some failed melting pot , even i would vote for it . 
  you 're not even funny . . 
  good but overly dramatic . 
  what about [ romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpkzf7xvjti ) ? 
  ok , maybe [ poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrjf3fwhkvi ) ?

  i 'm waiting for the day when plastic will play a much diminished role in food packaging . 
  today i can buy as low as 6 slices of smoked bacon in a plastic package plus 5 additional layers of plastic separating each slice from the other . 
  that 's just too much in my opinion . 
  i do n't know a good alternative to plastic yet though . . 
  your acidic way of schooling people does not help you very much . 
  i specified the preconditions quite clearly : `` as long the most profitable companies in ee have predominantly we shareholders . . '' . 
  your rant is off topic . 
  i 'm not going to even read it . 
  i think when it comes to swearing , we are totally slavs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmw-bxaempw, 
  i think it 's funnier than google can translate , 
  i 'm always fascinated by the dutch culture . 
  the way you kept your deep connection with the nature . . at least the mushrooms & `` herbal '' part of the nature if you know what i mean . . 
   yeah . 
  cuz i bet you 'd rather have becali as your boss than ghosn . 
  provocative crap . 
   it 's simply because there 's a difference in gdp no need to over complexity things . 
  not necessarily . 
  the profit repatriated by renault , societe generale , gdf suez and auchan from romania goes to french people even though that profit is part of the romanian gdp . 
  so even if by an economic miracle romanian gdp grows larger than french gdp , a large share of the wealth will continue to go to the french shareholders and the romanians will not feel at `` the same level '' as the french even if they will work and produce more .
