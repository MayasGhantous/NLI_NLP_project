  as far as i know , sandu ciorba is some gypsy ( he 's probably a gabor gypsy = white gypsies from transilvania who speak mainly hungarian ) who sings some weird music and until recently no one knew about him in romania . 
  his music is considered way too trashy even by gypsy standards . 
  good gypsy music is : fanfare ciocarlia , taraf de haiduks , taraful din clejani . 
  i do n't know . . 
  i suppose some gypsy has to post his songs here . . at least if he feels represented by ciorba . 
  i do n't , 
  that my friend is the gypsy `` cultural '' heritage :d ( i like the [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iugfurqyhs ) more though ), 
  as long as eastern europe borrows money from western european banks and as long the most profitable companies in ee have predominantly we shareholders ... ee will never get to the same level as we . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpl-ct3xsy i like a lot the serbian influence ( the accordion ) on the vlach music, 
  being in the path of migrations , romania is a bit of everything http://postimg.org/image/vdnl25n2b/ but judging from the language , at roots the romanians are latinized dacians & thracians which remained not-assimilated by the slavs ( they were mainly shepherds living in the mountains ) . 
  you can see this pattern at the vlachs ( aromanians ) in serbia , albania , macedonia & northern greece . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfxu51mbxlw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx2wamepr1c nah just kidding ... ( these are the originals ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wcmfgdmow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koeevt0nfom bonus . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79qvepebrwa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82xlr_cao_k [ ciuleandra dance performed in rep. of moldova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g68hhqec9e0 ), 
  i 'm sure you already contribute a lot to the spanish defense budget so there might not be big differences there but still , in the long run , when you decide to go on your own , there might arise a lot of economical issues which are not very evident now . 
  for example due its size spain can have its own defense industry and save a lot of money for itself and even make money by selling to spanish client states ( south america ? ), 
  but if you split , your side of that industry might remain out of the loop if you fail to secure contracts ( and usually you fail to secure contracts due to low `` bargaining power '' or due to competition from what 's left of spain ) . 
  and this works the same for many other sectors , not only defense . 
  what are the main reasons for splitting out of spain ? 
  i know little about catalunya other than that it 's more rich than the rest of spain and you have different language and identity . 
  is n't there a danger to lose some important advantages ( bargaining power ) when you become a small independent country ? 
  i think it 's hard to impose your interests against countries like france , germany , uk , italy when you have ~ 7.5 mil citizens . 
  so are you proposing us to just stop listening anyone who is not in power because if he 's not in power he obviously ca n't achieve anything ?? 
  common . 
  i do n't expect varoufakis to amount to anything but ffs , you can hear everywhere merkel 's point of view about greece , tsipras and varoufakis . 
  are n't you really curious to hear from varoufakis himself ( not from merkel ) his point of view about eurozone , germany and merkel ?? 
  how can you hope to know the truth if you listen to only one side ... 
  lol , that 's why i insisted you to ignore that cunty smirk and try to judge what he is saying not his apparent attitude . 
  believe me i had no favorable attitude towards anything greek , but imho this guy is worth listening to . 
  just give it 25 minutes and you will see he 's not talking about greek problems as much as about real eurozone problems . 
  ( i do n't know who are his supporters and i do n't really care . 
  i 'm not a follower looking for a cause . . ), 
  i 'm going on a limb here and ask you to put your prejudices down for a moment and just listen what the man has to say and to understand his point of view even if you disagree . 
  i think it 's worth it ( even if you do n't watch all this video ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cca68u3p_z8 ( skip to 4:00 and i bet at 30:00 you will feel much better informed ), 
  just fyi , there was a rumor in romania that merkel made some secret negotiations with putin when the ukrainian shit started , about the eu and russian `` spheres of influence '' and many romanians are afraid that merkel will sacrifice moldova and the transnistrian shit just to get some good gas deals from putin . 
  so we care if merkel is `` kissy-kissy '' with putin because we worry they might pull another `` ribbentrop-molotov '' on us . 
  why did n't you `` provide '' independence to chechnya then ? 
  they fought for independence too . 
  you are blinded by the propaganda , hypocrite . 
  russia planted agents and small amounts of russian citizens in all the countries around them during soviet union , and when these agents scream that `` russian minority '' is opressed , russia has the pretext to invade and take territory . 
  you did the same thing with transnistria and many other places . 
  that 's why everybody hates you and be assured , when oil and gas lose their price and importance , your shitty gangster country goes to hell . 
  romanian oil peaked for sure but there is still some juice in ploiesti , suplacu de barcau and iirc they discovered something in the black sea recently ? 
  i do n't know , but is n't the free movement of capital the real issue ? 
  because once you exit the eu , it 's not only the goods , services and the workforce movement that ceases . . it 's also the capital movement . 
  my guess is the city cares most about the movement of capital . 
  pack for germany in this moment and protest for your rights !!!, 
  this outrageous state of affairs should stop !, 
  transnistria contains almost the same type of russophone and russophile ukrainians like donbas . . and also transnistria was brainwashed more pro-russia than ukraine , because russia paid their pensions the last two decades . . 
  paris was/is the home of a freaking empire dude . . while your country ( and others . . like mine ) were/are vassals to one empire or another their entire existence . 
  2009 was when moldova still had some money . . 
  and the eu law was that gazprom should not have monopoly on the pipe . 
  so gazprom invited the only gas producer in the area , romania , to also transport gas using that pipe in order for it to comply with the eu law . 
  and romania refused . 
  pipe closed . 
  ex-president basescu , who is the main proponent for a unification before 2020 said that he consulted all the main actors and usa/uk/germany / france were something like : `` if you can do it , do it '' . 
  russia obviously opposed any idea of unification - with or without transnistria - and basescu said that `` we tried to work with the russians but they always care only about their interests '' and since then , romania denied the russians any new gas reservoirs and pipelines trough romania and we opposed south stream by not allowing romanian gas ( `` basescu : not a single drop !!! '' ), 
  to be transported through it ( which effectively closed the project ) . 
  exactly . 
  the first thing the russian communists did when they took some land was to wipe out the `` intelligentsia '' ( executions , deportations , intimidation , denial of access to higher education ) . 
  see katyn massacre in poland . 
  moldova , romania and many countries where the russians left their mark will need many generations to recover from being transformed into lands of sheeple . 
  whoa , that was clever ... 
  i never imagined to be possible . 
  i also do n't watch much cyclism . . 
  dude , wtf ? 
   of course they know that they would still not have a chance to fight russia so why buy them then ? 
  we do n't have money enough for the land and air forces . . 
  the ships are second or third priority for romania . 
  historically romania had very little need of a strong navy to defend anything in black sea . 
  the only thing we need to defend is the city & port of constanta which can be much easily defended from the shore & air than from the sea . 
  if we had money to buy frigates and ships we would n't buy 12 second hand f-16 from portugal . 
  we would buy at least 20 new , because f-16s are much more vital for the defense . 
  your guess is undermined by the logic you wrote previously . 
  no matter how many vessels romania and bulgaria bought alone , they would be insignificant compared to what russia has and would be easy victims . 
  if romania really wanted only to buy new vessels , it could have said so directly to france/usa/uk / germany ( like they did with the newly purchased radars and at rockets ) . 
  there would be no need to `` ask '' loudly and make these public announcements for that . 
  if i knock off all my birdies ... romania . 
  i do n't know exactly what `` romania wants '' either . 
  we were never particularly interested in waging maritime war ( especially against the russian colossus ) but my guess is that the romanian diplomacy ( possibly at nato/us suggestion ) is pushing this idea forward in this delicate moment in order to put even more pressure on russia in order for nato/us to obtain concessions in syria or ukraine ? 
  for the vlacho-bulgarian empire attaaack !!, 
  i foresee a return to the old `` cordial '' relations once uk quits eu :-), 
  yeah , it was kind of greedy , but that was the name of the game then . 
  when the ottoman empire fell , everybody wanted a piece of the action . 
  also the russians encouraged us to take land from the south & west because they did n't want to give back bessarabia to us . 
  on the other hand you got back southern dobrudja later with not much war over it . 
  we are cool now :-), 
  romania was allowed by tsar nicholas ii to intervene in favor of serbia ( because he was not agreeing with the bulgarian plan ) . 
  also :  romania ( ... ) officially warned bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new balkan war , due to bulgaria 's refusal to cede the fortress of silistra as promised before the first balkan war in exchange for romanian neutrality you have been warned !, 
  :d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_wars, 
  at that time , russia was the arbitrator in the area and romania got the green light from the nicholas ii to intervene against the bulgars ( russia was ally of serbia ) . 
  if the russians did n't want to teach the bulgars a lesson , they would n't have allowed us to get involved . 
  for romania it was a war with very little passion ( although , privately the back stabbing felt good :-) ) . 
  also this :  `` romania had raised an army and declared war on bulgaria on 10 july ( 27 june ) as it had from 28 ( 15 ) june officially warned bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new balkan war , due to bulgaria 's refusal to cede the fortress of silistra as promised before the first balkan war in exchange for romanian neutrality . '', 
  `` oh , we are so more latin than you !!! '',

  nah , it 's just good spirited music . . ( like the russian , german and our anthem in my opinion . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpkzf7xvjti ), 
  your anthem makes even me feel patriotic :d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrjf3fwhkvi,
