you 're awesome !, 
  thanks so much !, 
  yeah , i 've learned the lesson of best friends affectionate ` insults ' the hard way , but my boyfriend might feel quite at home with that haha . 
  i enjoy the high level of irony , but speaking of culture , one thing that gets me worried about the scots is that i might not be able to understand the strongest of accents , but i think it 's a matter of getting used to it . 
  also everybody keeps mentioning the hottest gay scene etc but i 'm not quite a party person haha , i only want people to be nice and respectful if i 'm holding hands with my partner , or have dinner in a romantic restaurant , that sort of thing , and as far as i understand that is the case ( yeah , except the odd jerk but who pays them any notice ) . 
  i expect edinburgh is not quite as pricy as london , am i wrong to assume that ? 
  thanks for all the info , it 's priceless , especially coming from some1 who 's living there . 
  wow , this is one of the most insightful answers i got , thanks !, 
  actually i pretty much ca n't stand sunny days and i would rather dress up for the cold than sweat till dehydration in the sun , but of course i should try it first . 
  as long as the excessive raining and snowing is handled well by the infrastructure of the city ( which i suspect it is ) i 'm down for having no more than 2 sunny weeks per year . 
  here it 's awful when it snows or rains too much - not because of the cold , but because the city maintenance is the worst and you have to make your way through large puddles , parked cars , mounds of dirty snow etc. 
  if the streets are clean and walkable in edinburgh during winter , i 'm the happiest - i do n't care much about the sun , especially since i heard sometimes the aurora can be seen from edinburgh , which is an awesome bonus . 
  thank you so much for your point of view , it 's really helpful :d, 
  thank you for your input . 
  i 'll wait to see how brexit plays out . 
  thank you for the insight on portugal , i plan to visit . 
  otherwise , i am really uncomfortable with your apparent islamophobia and calling all those countries semi-muslim , using this word as a derogatory qualifier . 
  it 's not fair , man ... you know , to the non-terrorist muslims ... you know , like 99.9 % of them . 
  thank you for this comprehensive breakdown . 
  i do n't know german nor dutch  it seems like a fine place and i know the architectural scene is amazing . 
  i guess i 'll look more into it . 
  the language is scary though , but if i decide something , i 'll commit to it . 
  whenever i hear words like * it 's very diverse and accepting regardless of race sexuality etc * i feel butterflies in my stomach as if i am falling in love haha, 
  thanks for the insight :d ( i do seem to abuse this word a lot lol ), 
  i suppose that 's true . 
  thank you for the advice , it 's rather eye-opening . 
  thank you very much !, 
  it 's great to hear from someone working in the field . 
  i guess i 'll see in time how things turn out post-brexit, 
  i see , thank you , this is really helpful . 
  well it 's a good thing that i 'll only be ready to move a couple of years from now and i 'll see in time the effects of brexit and take a final decision as things become clearer . 
  thank you for the insight , but i think i only see spain as a great vacation destination . 
  other places present more advantages to me . 
  although i ca n't wait to visit barcelona sometime soon . 
  indeed . 
  you know , if i were interested to go as far away from europe as possible , i would n't have posted in / r/askeurope . 
  i 'm unwilling to make the jump to canada and you 're seriously suggesting australia ? 
  no , i 'll stick to europe besides ... ~ ~ huge spiders ~ ~, 
  i see , well it will be a long time till i 'll have a right to vote in scotland , if i decide to move there at all , but you make a good point . 
  lol, 
  while i appreciate it , i do n't think i can adapt to eastern culture . 
  it was my understanding that / u/maninthewoods was speaking about the trends of xenophobia he noticed , not that he personally stands by them . 
  i feel bad for finding this funny . 
  ^ _ ^ yeah , but it was funny . 
  i prefer colder climates nevertheless . 
  i suppose that would be the highroad and i am a generally optimistic and idealistic person . 
  but even i remain hopeless in the face of the countless injustices i see all around me here . 
  also , after spending a lot of time in the closet , being oppressed , unable to be myself and then facing rejection from those most dear to me when coming out , i do n't think i have much fight left in me . 
  it is not my fault , nor merit that i am born here and gay , so out of self preservation , if nothing else , i am willing to leave behind a society and nation that really has n't given me many reasons to fight for it . 
  once i get my life sorted out , who knows , maybe i 'll get into activism . 
  but for now i really ca n't see any glimmer of hope in a place where 2.2 million people just signed a petition in order to make the constitution spell out that marriage is exclusively between a man and a woman . 
  also , i want to have a family and children in a safe and welcoming environment . 
  though i would tip my hat and bow down to whomever is able to sacrifice their well being for the purpose of improving things . 
   how would you rank europe/eu , your country , or ** something else ** ( region of europe , country subdivision , language , ethnicity , ** etc. 
  ** ) in importance to your ** identity ** ? 
  it was my understanding the op was not strictly referring to territorial identities , which is why i included sexual and cultural aspects of my identity . 
  hence my question and worries : / i really have to get in touch with some romanians who have been living in these places for some time . 
  i 'm always shocked and outraged when i hear such news ... 
  thanks for the insight  i know some french at a decent level , it 's a bit rusty , but it would n't be a problem . 
  and as i 've said somewhere else on this thread , securing a sustainable job will be a top priority , long before i pack my bags , haha . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  of course i 'll visit first . 
  i am eager to , in fact . 
  been doing it on youtube and street view so far , but that does n't really count haha . 
  thanks for the reassurance  i know the media often makes things look worse than they are . 
  i am happy to hear about your father 's story . 
  i am going to assume you 've never been discriminated against because of your sexual orientation , nor did you give much thought to how a kid with same sex parents would experience school life , bullying etc in a country that 's overwhelmingly backwards concerning lgbt issues . 
   sorry to disappoint you and to break your dreams , but this shit faced by probably half of europe agreed . 
  the eastern half . 
  thanks for the tips , yeah , i 'll search for some romanians living in my target cities . 
  also , about the whole brexit deal , i kind of worry about the future of scotland . 
  i do n't feel i know enough to have a pro/against position on this , but it is worrying to me what a second indyref could mean for scottish economical stability ( and what would the long term effects of brexit be , for that matter ) . 
  if scotland would still be in the eu and i would be able to secure a job there in a stable economy , i would head to edinburgh without a second thought , but then again , life 's not a bed of roses , is it ? 
  haha, 
  thanks , that 's why i am considering copenhagen . 
  i have a couple of friends living there  but yeah , the language would be a challenge , though an enjoyable one . 
  as for the pricey aspect , no matter where i move , securing a sustainable job will be a top priority , long before i pack my bags . 
  other than not being able to have a family and kids in a non-discriminatory society , facing a corrupt legal system , having my tax money go to funding cathedrals instead of social services and education and with no electable political platform proposing to fix these issues in sight , no real problems , no . 
  this is incredibly helpful and insightful . 
  thank you , 
  thank you , that really gives me hope , 
  thanks for the suggestions . 
  i am taking career opportunities into account as well . 
  yes , i am aware of the bias against romanians being perpetrated mostly in relation to gypsies , but there are generalizations and then again , i would n't want to be one of those `` i am a white non-gypsy romanian , i am good , they are bad '' sorts of people . 
  i 'm looking forward to visit spain in the near future , but i do n't see myself living there - besides the problems you mention ( very insightful , thank you ) , i 'd trade the spanish weather for the northern kind anytime . 
  also , my boyfriend objects to the ridiculous amount of cute guys there , so that 's a no-go , haha . 
  world 2 . 
  gay 3 . 
  europe 5 . 
  romania 6 . 
  western europe 7 . 
  the us 6-8 i do n't necessarily identify geographically with these places - never lived there ( yet ) - but i do culturally and in some cases politically . 
  i 'm also quite wary of nationalism as it tends to imply the idea that `` i am better than you because i have the extraordinary * achievement * of being born in this place . '', 
  xpost / r/lgbt i am posting this here as well to get a more specific insight on the `` xenophobia '' part of the question . 
  it is pretty much common knowledge which are the most gay friendly places in europe , but i am not quite clear about the extent of the bias against romanians in these places . 
  i would like to know to what degree should i worry about being stigmatized because of my nationality in different places . 
  also , while i mention canada in my message below , i would really prefer to remain in europe ( unless the anti-immigrant sentiment and policies continue to gain ground and reach an unbearable level ) . 
  ** context : ** i am in my early 20s , gay and romanian . 
  in a couple of years i 'll be done with university ( studying architecture ) and i am planning to move with my boyfriend to a place where we can build our life together ( get married , have kids ) and have the same shot at happiness as the straight couple next door . 
  given the social and political climate of the moment ( with the waves of immigrants leading to right wing parties gaining popularity , brexit , denmark tightening on immigration etc.
