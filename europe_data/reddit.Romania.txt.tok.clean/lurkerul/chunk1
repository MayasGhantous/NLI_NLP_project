  we 'd actually be more western too , all the while practicing an age old eastern european tradition !,

  you brilliant bastard . 
  do n't let that extra chromosome get you down !, 
  ow , my poor nationalistic heart , i 'm wounded, 
  cool story bro, 
  ** cue joke about pigs and olteni ( southern romanians ) * *, 
   a lot of your language was created by french influence relatively recently . 
  yes , because literacy was very rampant in peasant villages , it would be very easy to change the language , even to the base gramatical core like that . . ^ ( ^ ^ ^ / s ) [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac\u0219u%27s_letter ) takes a piss all over that theory . 
  wtf did they teach you in school ? 
  it 's worse than soviet indoctrination . 
   and i 'm pretty sure that romanians came to transylvania after 1330 . 
  of course you are , those like you always are . 
  cool story bro . 
  me , being an evil romanian nationalist who 's also stupid and obviously likes to keep oppressed the glorious hungarian master race ca n't quite comprehend your xenophobic , self-righteous , ignorant and irredentist speech there . 
  oh well , ca n't have 'em all . 
  at least theres transilvania . 
   right so romanians were there before ? 
  then italy should have no claims over milan or sicily , after all , italy did n't exist until recently right ? 
   romanian origins are dispute so do n't give me this dacian crap . 
  mostly and more vocally by hungarians , funny is n't it ? 
   basically colonized transylvania after communists settled you guys there ? 
  [ hahahahahahahahaha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5e7fejhw0 ) oh man , that 's some good stuff you 've been smoking . 
  the majority always belonged to romanians , even by the habsburg empire 's census , and it was like that long before they came along . 
  that 's some soviet propaganda level shit right there . 
   you guys think that transylvania belongs to you and not the romanians and hungarians and germans and gypsies that live there in peace together ? 
  oh , yes . 
  it 's the home to all of those . 
  but the undisputed majority are romanians , and the territory belongs to the romanian state , as it should and do n't you ever forget that . 
   and oh please , 600 000 + people do n't compare to a little village . 
  this statement makes you sound like the unintelligent nationalist that you are . 
  by your logic i guess finland should stop giving the swedes rights and stop giving \u00c5land islands rights . 
  but wait people are actually happy over there unlike in romania ... oh , but they do have rights , theres no difference between a romanian ethnic and a hungarian one . 
  all cultural rights are preserved and respected , unlike the romanian minority in hungary , and unlike the barbarism that was happening before 1918 if you had the misfortune of being a romanian in austro-hungarian controlled transilvania . 
  but then assholes from hungary who call themselves politicians come along , being in campaign and looking for votes , stir shit up with claims of territorial autonomy and shit , so the peace is n't really disturbed by the locals now is it ? 
  so you do n't get to talk shit , since you do n't know shit . 
  cheerio, 
  good god ... wtf is that ? 
  i think i need to bleach my eyes ... 
   haha , i 'm sure you do n't advocate the same for szeklerland and transylvania . 
  disregarding the fact that the two cases are worlds apart and have little to nothing in common , you 're presuming that transilvania going to romania was an act of injustice . 
  it was n't . 
  transilvania as a whole was never hungarian . 
  romanians were the majority there . 
  by your logic , every pocket of different ethnics should be independent ( village-states anyone ? ) . 
  btw , you do know that szekely means settler right ? 
  as in colonizer . 
  it 's their home now too , ok , but that does n't mean they should act like it 's a totally different place entirely from the whole . 
  edit : i accidentally a word, 
  i liked the `` ocupanti betivi , ocupati pana muriti , criminalilor . '', 
  ( translation for those interested : `` alcoholic occupants , occupy 'till you die , you murderers '' ), 
   romania is too anesthetized with provincial hedonism what ? 
   and phantasms about `` being european '' . 
  that 's not a phantasm , that 's a goal , always was since we were still the historical provinces . 
  one that 's starting to become reality more and more with each passing day . 
  it does n't matter if nothing significant will happen in the extremely near future , what is important is that there 's been a shift towards union with romania among those over the prut . 
  and if you 've cared enough to glance at romania 's foreign affairs with moldova , you 'd notice that bucharest has been putting important softpower moves for some time now , so i know you 're wrong when you say that romania is too anesthetized in regards to our brothers . 
  if only cain used a katyusha against abel ... would 've saved god a lot of hassle . 
  pffff ... noobs .
