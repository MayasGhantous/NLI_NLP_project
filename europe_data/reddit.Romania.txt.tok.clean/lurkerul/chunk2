  warfare is not going anywhere anytime soon , conflict is intrinsic to humans . 
  condemning does n't stop it , something else has to , be it things like mad or a valve to let the aggression out and / or solve the conflict in a less brutal way ( as i 've daydreamed earlier ) . 
  from what i remember , they are n't anymore ( at least in economical terms ) . 
  they 've cut funding to it , the only way they 're still supporting it is through the 14th russian army that 's stationed there as `` peacekeepers '' . 
  the growth of china is starting to slow down . 
  even with the free trade zones , which helped china a lot ( and are n't very communist to begin with ) . 
  time will tell , but if they slow down too much or stall , there 'll be hell to pay because they 're obligated to grow , since their population needs it like fresh air ( which is also something that they need ) . 
  a lot of things can change very quickly , russia proved that . 
  next step is to replace the armies with robots , both automated and human controlled , aces would be a thing again . 
  now countries would have to duke it out a la [ robot wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robot_wars_%28tv_series%29 ) . 
  they 'd have to fight it out until one of the economies ca n't support the production of robots . 
  next step would be to make something similar to the geneva convention and have the fights on preset battlefields . 
  now that would be awesome , and a much less gory alternative to solve altercations . 
  one can dream . 
  does n't change [ how i feel about it ] ( http://www.quickmeme.com/img/f7/f717e1d739a6ca8d54a6b7e0f6e8b1c6a1df9f2015efc2b40f6960924d8b32c1.jpg ) . 
  it 's the same thing as with the crimean peninsula . 
  he admitted that he sent troops there , but that does n't change the fact that crimea is still in russian hands . 
  ( not saying that putin had anything to do about what happened in and around ww2 , only that it does n't change anything if he admitted it ), 
  soviet man , best man !, 
  all hail the danube !, 
  i think op may be trolling . 
  look at the name , the age and the comments . 
  or it might just be a new user , who knows . 
  is it ? 
  meritocracy  political correctness, 
  imo the ** european ** union would be a poorer place ( not speaking strictly monetary ) if greece would leave . 
  considering that it 's bases are heavily influenced by the greek and roman world . 
  well , moldova obviously . 
  plot twist : they 're all ukrainians . 
  who does n't like a good twat ? 
  well . 
  happy easter ... 
  the spanish inqusition will show up , the time is right .

  we dislike him a little less than the other russian leaders . 
  one might say that we almost feel neutral towards him .

  say what you will about the nazis , but they had good taste when it came to [ fashion ] ( http://www.cvltnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hugo.jpg ) . 
  that music ruins it  . , 
  basically a more abusive version of [ this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1abksgi2io ) your story reminded me of that gem . 
  that 's a nice bridge you have there . 
  is it nice living under it ? 
  i 'd give you gold for this comment , but the russians [ took it all ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure ) . 
  i , as things are playing out now , do n't see the russians breaking past mariupol . 
  and if they 'd start doing what they did in eastern ukraine to moldova , they would basically start the transnistrian war 2.0 . 
  which in turn means that we could start a proxy war with the russians to get rid of their influence in moldova for good . 
  only this time , we would n't be fighting this war like we did during the [ transnistrian war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war ) , we 'd be fighting a proxy war against a russia with an economy in tatters , nato support and more importantly ukrainian support . 
  in all these hypothetical cases , if we 're the aggressor we 'd lose any high ground , any advantage . 
  does this mean that greece could owe us money , too ? 
  we 're starting to feel more and more european . 
  tl ; dr : islam , islam everywhere ? 
  i used to think so too , but then the whole shabang with russia and ukraine started . 
  russia has lost it 's support in ukraine and it does n't have the iron grip it used to have in moldova , add the sanctions and the russian economy that is in shambles and we have interesting times ahead . 
  from what i 've seen , in history , things like these ( and i 'm referring to the unification ) do n't happen because they were planned , but because certain events occur in such a way that an opportunity presents itself . 
  which is what i 'm seeing right now . 
  of course we could mop the floor with the 14th russian army , but we 'd have to deal with their 750.000 other buddies , and i do n't think nato would help since we 'd be the aggressor and the 5th article would n't be triggered . 
   so eventually there population will fall to the point where it would be uneconomical to not rejoin . 
  unless russia creates an inland kaliningrad ( highly unlikely ) . 
  that , and the fact that recently russia cut their money injections to them completely , transnistria needing russian funding to function , and the fact that ukraine decided to aid moldova resolve the transnistria situation after talks between the romanian president and the ukrainian one , which is a big step since they had ukrainian support for stuff like exports which there are indications of involving shady and illegal stuff . 
  is that you ? 
  those are in transnistria only ... so they could be a problem if those territories were to be included . 
  moldova could just go `` screw you guys , we 're going home . '', 
  from the other bank of the river and reunite without them , since that 's why transnistria was created by russia in the first place , to prevent that endeavour from happening . 
  but things are more complex than i portray them in this comment . 
  idk how much moldova wants those territories back and idk if leaving them there is an option , or a viable one . 
  that went really dark really fast  .  i like it !, 
  part of it . 
  there are a lot of geopolitical hurdles , and the situation in ukraine only complicates things . 
  still , personally , i think this is a time of great opportunity for such things , former soviet satellites are pushing themselves away from russia and russia is doing it 's share too , even if it is unintentional . 
  there is also the economical side of things , but i for one think that that should n't stop us . 
  i used to think that the reunification would be a medium to long term project , but recently ... not so much . 
  maybe it 's wishful thinking on my part , but 2018 is approaching and that marks 100 years since the great unification ( as it 's known here ) and unionistic ideas are starting to catch more and more in moldova , so who knows ? 
  perhaps things can change enough for something big to happen then . 
  master america has taught us well it seems . 
  short answer ? 
  long answer ? 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo . 
  he 's already in office . 
  growing your first set of teeth always hurts . 
  does n't matter , has to be done . 
  tl : dw : convoy passing through , car stopped to the side as per indications , another car did n't see , hit the first dude in the back , ricocheted off dude 's car and into the armored vehicle . 
  fun times were had . 
  [ beep beep mothufuka ] ( http://www.yumacountychambermac.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/stryker-in-action.jpg ), 
  no problem . 
  :d glad you liked them . 
   antonescu actually dissolved the guard when it started to become a special interest group . 
  i think codreanu was the one responsible for its rise . 
  not that i think the early iron guard was n't an outstanding thing . 
  but just so you know , you 're wrong . 
  i meant that he paved the way for them to get real political power . 
  his was alliance with hitler was just that , an alliance . 
  the fact remains that even when germany was obviously losing , he still wanted to support them . 
   there was no national socialism in romania . 
  i never claimed there was . 
   the most obvious would be the axiomatic truth that war is waged until the enemy is defeated . 
  it was never in our interests to go all out , that was nazi germany 's .
