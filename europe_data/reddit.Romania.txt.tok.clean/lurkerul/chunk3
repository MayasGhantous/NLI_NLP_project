   another reason would be that him stopping at the nistru would have soured his relation hitler and possibly prompted him to occupy romania after an eventual axis victory . 
  that did n't happen in finland , plus , i doubt it would sour it too much since we were supportive of their war efforts in a big way , see oil etc. 
  i also doubt that the germans would decide to attack for so little reason especially considering we had the second largest army in the axis . 
  the loss to gain ratio would make it unfeasible , and they would have had their hands full on the eastern front , so ( in my eyes ) that claim has no basis . 
   there was nothing to be gained from removing antonescu , nothing at all . 
  russia did everything it wanted to do to romania . 
  occupy it to whatever extent it wanted to occupy it , execute precisely who it wanted to execute , install precisely the ideology it wanted to install , install precisely the puppets it wanted to install , etc. 
  i doubt they would 've been as successful or had as much leeway if they found a former axis country with it 's army intact and not in shambles . 
  an army of [ 1,224,691 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_in_world_war_ii#the_war_on_the_eastern_front ) is n't something you just shirk off , especially if they switch to your alliance . 
   both vlad and ~ ~ antonescu ~ ~ ** the royal family ** are fundamental pillars upon which romania rests today . 
  ftfy . 
  even with carol ii who was the worst king , he still did important things culturally and diplomatic for romania , not to mention his predecessors who are to be thanked for the creation of our nation . 
  antonescu is still ultimately responsible for the rise of the iron guard , the slaughter of countless civilians and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of romanian soldiers because he decided to blindly support the nazis and push with them deeper into russia when he should 've just stayed at the border of basarabia , like the finns did with their reclaimed territory . 
  if king michael i did n't stage the coup and take the country back from antonescu there is no telling what the russians would 've done to romania if they came as invaders and not `` allies '' . 
  they did a lot of damage as is , so it 's safe to say it would 've been far worse . 
  you just [ wait ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_printing ) ... 
  yup , they 're awesome . 
  i 'm picky when it comes to what songs i like and i like pretty much all of their music . 
  they 're actually singing about bucovina in the [ mestecanis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y-bbtyay_c ) ( this one feature a little more `` growling '' and i do n't know how i feel about that , since the singer has an awesome voice , the refrain is glorious ) and [ straja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la6o-jibp3g ) songs . 
  the `` straja '' song is actually an homage to an old folk song , [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wcmfgdmow ) to be precise . 
  something like [ this ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncm7awemqmu&amp;t=0m48s ) ( i think you get the gist of it without english subtitles ) k , a more serious ( not by much , and obvious ) answer would be : defend ourselves ? 
  and wait for the 5th article to activate while doing it . 
  ( for those wondering , in the video , the song in the background is [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_p-ed55ifk ) . ), 
  romania : [ bucovina - luna preste varfuri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wivie0fyig ) and , since you mentioned romanian rap : [ ombladon - noapte buna bucuresti ( cu guess who ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehaunns_9ig ) [ b.u.g. 
  mafia - in anii ce au trecut ( videoclip hd ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uja146bpwy4 ) [ cheloo feat .

  idk how many have a pocket knife for defense , i suspect there are rare for self protection , but here in romania in [ pulan we trust .

  in rural areas , they just pick up an axe that 's around there somewhere . 
  ( note that `` pula '' means dick and `` pulan '' means `` baton '' , the hitting kind obviously , so it 's quite funny to refer to it by the `` pulan '' moniker , especially when you consider the shape ), 
  are mops ok ? 
  * upgrade ... complete . 
  we already did . 
  idk how many there are left running around , but it would be safe to say that the sri is monitoring them . 
  pretty much nailed it . 
  same , not dissapointed . 
  who 's that guy ? 
  that escalated quickly , did n't it ?

  true , but it is still a `` out of the frying pan , into the fire '' situation : /, 
  reminded me of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantin_t\u0103nase#death ) :  r\u0103u era cu `` der , die , das ''  da-i mai r\u0103u cu `` davai ceas ''  de la nistru p\u00e2n ' la don  davai ceas , davai palton  davai ceas , davai mo\u015fie  hara\u015fo tov\u0103r\u0103\u015fie translation :  it was bad with `` der , die , das ''  but it 's worse with `` davai ceas ''  from the dniester to the don  davai watch , coat and long-johns ,  you can forego your ownership ,  hara\u015fo comradeship, 
  `` so you know how i got these talents ? '', 
   oh , and you should n't talk about slaughtering innocents when avram iancu is your national hero who did n't do anything else than slaughtering 6000 hungarian civilians only to change the ethnic composition of transylvania . 
  yes , the `` slaughter '' of 6000 hungarian civilians changed the ethnic composition of transylvania drastically . 
  that 's the most asinine statement i 've heard around here . 
  you do realize that during the rebellion the fighting included romanians and hungarians too right ? 
  and what could that mean ? 
  people die on both sides , do n't act like only the oh so poor hungarians died who were being brutalized by the big evil romanians . 
  the atrocities were caused on both sides , when hungarians rebelled against the empire and demanded their rights what did they do when the romanians asked to be part of those who were granted rights , side by side with the hungarians ? 
  they started building scaffolds to hang the romanian peasantry . 
  that 's why avram iancu lead the romanian rebellion , not the stupid assumption that he wanted `` to change the democrafic '' , what was there to change ? 
  we were the majority there all along , among the ethnic groups . 
  only hungarian sources paint avram iancu as a mindless butcher , excuse me if i choose to not believe them , especially with the hungarian tendency to shit on our history . 
  and no , avram iancu is n't a national hero yet , the procedure had some kinks in it and had to be sent back to redo it . 
  but he will soon be , proclaimed a national hero by a member of a minority no less , if things go well with the bureaucratic procedure . 
  enjoy orban and the only opposition he has , the fascists from jobbik , you 're one of the few hungarians who deserve them . 
  not if they 're cheap enough to swarm the enemy . 
   and romania/bulgaria are western because they suck the us 's dick  hungary is a lot more developed than the likes of romania or bulgaria could you be more condescending ? 
  edit : we may be sucking usa 's dick when it comes to superpowers , but your not the one to talk , since hungary is twirling the russian one , especially since they were the ones who slaughtered innocents during the revolt they crushed , nor were we so eager to `` suck it '' that we allowed ourselves to be spit on our faces by allowing putin to commemorate soviet soldiers in our country . 
  and you are right , hungary looks more western than bulgaria or romania , but then again , we did n't have the austrians to civilize us [ .

  what you just said ... is retarded . 
  you get butthurt because you get flak about russian investments yet you do the same if ( in your opinion ) romania does the same thing with the us . 
  the difference is that we are n't the ones breaking ranks by drawing investments from the country that should only be sanctioned right now . 
  also , the law that you talk about was n't `` ignored '' it was rescinded , and it was about nato troops , not us ones . 
  and it was n't rescinded because we want investments , it was rescinded because russia is getting more and more aggressive in it 's interactions with us . 
  the investments are coming either way , thanks in part to hungary since it is n't reliable anymore . 
  [ well , it is love and life , if not 1st world .

  soon eastern yurop will be only yurop and true yurop !, 
  he always does the hand-on-the-heart thingy whenever the anthem is played . 
  little bit of a clich\u00e9e , but personally , i do n't mind it very much . 
  especially if , until now , that 's been my only gripe with him as president . 
  that 's what the ukrainians thought .

  [ k ] ( http://www.kevinneeld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/big-lebowski-meme.jpg ), 
  then it would n't mind if the serbs would join nato . 
  glad we 've cleared that . 
  it 's their business if they care or not . 
  their geopolitical future that they 'll shape with these choices . 
   russia does n't pose a threat to them ? 
  like russia did n't pose a threat to their `` brothers '' the ukrainians ? 
  who would 've thought around 2012-2013 that that would happen ? 
  you do realize that russia wanted to go with troops and helli 's and start shit there during the war , right ? 
  every time the russians wanted to help `` keep the peace '' frozen conflicts and destabilization ensued ( see transnistria , abhkazia , south ossetia , nagorno-karabakh ) . 
  the only reason the russians did n't go there is that romania denied entry in it 's airspace . 
  and now ? 
  it appears very much that russia does n't care about stability , nor is it very predictable . 
  also , the panslavism bullshit is on the rise over there and is supported by putin & co. 
  can confirm . 
  nato is literally worse than the black plague crossed with the spanish flu . 
  we were bullied into nato and can not escape . 
  ^ ( ^ ^ ^ ^ russia ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ help ) we are in no way reassured or supported by nato and our nato allies in this time , and i am russia would act very civil to us if we were n't in nato .
