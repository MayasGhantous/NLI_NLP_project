  what the fuck ukraine ? 
  burning bridges much ? 
  ( if information is confirmed ) edit : hello new user . 
  tbh , i do n't think we have any songs that are anti-war in our musical thesaurus . 
  sure there are sad ones about war , but not the anti-war kind . 
  edit : does one for conflict work for you ? 
  this is more in regards to the romanian revolution ( which happened around christmas time ) and those who have died then . 
  [ pune , tat\u0103 , steag la poart\u0103 / put , father , the flag at the gate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez3jwzcw4b4 ) the monolog at the start :  patriotism is n't a bracelet , or a bow tie , or a hat to wear or not , to decide if it suits you or not . 
  you are born with it , it is as if written in your fate , you ca n't take it off you , you wear it like a shroud , you do n't buy it from foreign courts . 
  and to sell it ? 
  you ca n't sell it for a kind of suffering edged painfully on pillars of old soul and beliefs . 
  i hear and i see , i read and i shut up , overwhelmed by an ancestral disgust , i cry in shame because i used to be a dacian and because now i 've become a wart in the toothless mouth of i-don ` t-know-who who 's chewing my pride up and nails my tears and crucifies my poetry . 
  the song starts here : . 
   put , father , the flag at the gate ,  and forgive me , forgive me for i have died ,  i know that mother is still waiting for me ,  and i also know that in a moment her hair has gone gray . 
   what a gentle light ... is sweetening our deaths  we who have fallen in bucharest ,  my mothers hair , lightening the paths  of unseen heavenly ways . 
   carolers are going by tonight ,  `` leru-i ler , flori de mar , leru-i ler ''  we , with crying eyes towards our country  tremble at heavenly gates . 
   what a gentle light ... is sweetening our deaths  we who have fallen in bucharest ,  my mothers hair , lightening the paths  of unseen heavenly ways . 
   a crumb of a carol ...  take it , god , to the angels , up high ,  so that in a night , may it light ,  the candle of those who are gone . 
   what a gentle light ... is sweetening our deaths  we who have fallen in bucharest ,  my mothers hair , lightening the paths  of unseen heavenly ways . 
   put , father , the flag at the gate ,  and forgive me , forgive me for i have died ,  i know that mother is still waiting for me ,  and i also know that in a moment her hair has gone gray .

   romanians : not romans . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  do you even [ may-may ? 
  i knew this was coming \u0ca0 \u2323 \u0ca0, 
  sooooo ... the same old antisemitism found in other parts of europe ? 
  theres not enough space left around for that . 
  god damn it bulgaria !, 
  you see now why we have to [ reunite with moldova ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldovan_wine ), 
  if you look around , it 's very noticeably there . 
  and experts in the field have concluded that too . 
  for something more in depth read [ this ] ( http://m.hotnews.ro/stire/19787285 ) . 
  ( sorry non-romanian speakers , you 're left out ), 
  i 'd hate to be the assistant when the bathroom break comes up .

  saying  all the pictures feature us troops does n't exclude the romanian ones . 
  the `` all '' is meant for the pictures . 
  idk about 6 tho ... it looks like a romanian soldier with desert camo , i 've seen that hat on romanian soldiers in afghanistan before , plus he 's using a weapon not issued by the us army . 
  but i might be wrong . 
  who needs hands-free when you have gluephone \u2122 ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're trying to say  . , 
   i have a suspicion that a subsection of the serbian population has the same sort of post imperial hangover that some portions of the russian population has . 
  they used to call the shots in a country twice as large as what they have now . 
  good thing the serbs like us , we 'd have to deal with two of those if it were n't for that  . , 
  yes . 
  actually , all the pictures feature us troops ( except # 2 maybe ) . 
  they did operation dragoon ride to the north ( that 's why you see all the pictures with civilians waving ) and to the south ( in romania more ) they did operation dacian warhawk ( joint airforce exercise ) and saber junction 15 . 
  the pictures you see were from phase i of the saber junction operation `` early entry '' . 
  other major exports include vodka and mail brides !, 
  ( not male brides , that 's a big no-no ), 
  plot twist !, 
  putin is the one that will restore the balance ... that 's why he went dark side . 
  he 's the russian anakin . 
  he recently started running amok . 
  soooo ... on one hand we have a very annoying and crippling inferiority complex , on the other we blame everyone but ourselves ? 
  i would n't download any links from freshly created accounts if i were you guys . 
  to you , maybe , but i thought it was to see what the usa army was doing to reassure the eastern europeans . 
  the americans are here for some time now , it 's not our fault that there are no greetings to post [ :'( ] ( http://i.reactionclips.com/vmccc.gif ), 
  plot twist ... they 've been here all along !, 
  dun * dun * *** duuuuunn *** that shield is protecting the oil too :d, 
  not necessarily related to this , but the young turks suck . 
  by god !, 
  you 're right !, 
  putin !, 
  deliver us from the immoral west !, 
  you do realize that russia were imperialistic long before they became the soviet union right ? 
  those tendencies were n't created by the soviets . 
  whether you like it or not , it has already happened , and it is the natural course of things . 
  spare me the idealism . 
  countries do n't act as individuals . 
  why would you ever trust russia in the first place ? 
  if you have an alliance , why the fuck would you exclude the most powerful member of it ? 
  over semantics no less ... nato was created to give russia pause from it 's imperialistic tendencies . 
  while russia toned it down , it was used as a partner to it and took the global policing force role . 
  now russia is starting again and nato is needed more than ever . 
  diminishing it would be stupidity beyond belief . 
  * romania * -- * 16 * : / * hungary * -- * 17 * in hindsight , 16 is satisfactory .

  we need to step up our game !, 
   a tolerant immigration policy is somehow lame [ sweden in 25 years .

  that was three hrs ago . 
  you 're late to the party  . , 
  as someone informed on the topic , stakes can be used in other ways . 
  that made no sense whatsoever . 
  tell me , is sweden trying to be the sjw tumblr section of europe or does it come natural , like the condescension and hypocrisy ? 
   american politicians in particular and european politicians in general are some of the most ignorant fools when the issue comes to anything outside their own borders . 
  ooook . 
  this started off well . 
   one important historical fact about russia is that russia is a unique civilizational empire built upon defense not offense . 
  what this means is that historically , russia does not start the wars , or series of wars [ hahahahahahahahahahahaha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5e7fejhw0 )  russia is a defensive empire is n't `` empire '' the geopolitical entity that takes shit that should n't belong to it by force and aggression and holds it the same way ? 
  ( especially the old types of empires category , russia being still one of those primitive empires )  after 800 years of almost non-stop aggression by europeans , russia does not tolerate any enemy massing on her borders in what appears as a preparation for invasion or the creation of large scales basing areas as would be a us neo-con dominated ukraine . 
  move along . 
  this is the typical `` russia under siege !,
