  well ... the muslim population ca n't be called out since they 're not 100 % whatever derogatory term you can come up with . 
  on the other hand the marine le pen population is 100 % bitch . 
  the left-wing extremists need to step up their game . 
  thanks . 
  i hope this orban thing comes to an end sooner for you guys . 
  from what i 've noticed you guys are n't very happy with him , or with the fact that he does stuff that large numbers of hungarians do n't agree to . 
  dunno , but i think the [ romanian anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztwgwehiwm0 ) is quite close to the top . 
  soon eastern yurop will be true yurop and only yurop !, 
  actually that explains why romania has that high a score . 
  the more unhappy hungary is , the more happy romania is ! ^ ( ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ), 
  til that poles are an insectoid species . 
  we can snare more countries with eurovision . 
  european dominance is assured .

  you know ... marrying underage children , having different gypsy clans fight each other with shit like machetes , axes and katanas because one idiot insulted another ( in a town / village i might add ) , having said clans in the first place with a `` bulibasa '' ( chief ) on top who uses said clan as an organized crime group , start organized begging and then proceed to cuss/assault if no money is given , rob people , beat people , erecting slums on public property ( as in parks ) and then make an unhygienic mess of the place , build a slum on someones land and then assault the owner of it because he wants to use it , steal farmers crops ( funny story with this one , a farmers union got robbed by gypsies very often and they decided to give seeds ( potatoes more exactly ) to the gypsies so they can plant their own crops and not steal theirs , when the mayor of the village and the representative got there they were almost beaten by the gypsies because `` how dare they put them to work '' and then they proceeded to take the potatoes for planting and ate them ) , refuse to send children to school etc. . . that 's all i can think about for now . 
   there are no good apples in the mainstream parties . 
  i disagree . 
  just because they have corruption problems does n't mean they 're rotten to the core , to the last member . 
  also , by your logic , how in the hell are the people of macovei ( which you apparently support ) any better ? 
  since a lot of them are part of the `` old guard '' , macovei included . 
  who says we need new parties ? 
  we just need the bad apples out . 
  and if we have to resort to alternatives like what macovei does , then god help us all . 
  i liked how the hungarian ultras and the romanian ultras were wailing on each other and the guys from bgs security were wailing on everybody ( non-ultras too , bgs does n't discriminate ) . 
  yup ... it was pointed out to the guys who made it that they used the seychelles flag . 
  error 404 . 
  answer not found . 
  how many romanian monica macovei accounts are there  .  this is getting ridiculous . 
  he 's not even old enough for his 72 virgins . 
  what latin american revolution ? 
  the power of jan pawe\u0142 compels you belarus !, 
  i doubt it 's hungary that 's butthurt . 
  more like extremist/irredentist hungarians who dream of the greater hungary ... but then again those hungarians see the existence of us as a state an insult . 
  putin is kill . 
  such is life in ~ ~ soviet ~ ~ democratic ( and very much not fascist ) russia . 
   it celebrates the treaty of trianon . 
  the fuck ? 
  the treaty was on the 4th of june and went into effect on the 31 of july . 
  december 1st celebrates the union of the last province that created the current romanian state . 
  if celebrating that , the creation on my country as it is today , is grounds to offend any other nations , well , then they have a problem . 
  tl ; dr : 1st of december is n't about `` hurr durr the hungarians lost '' , it 's about us being whole for the first time in our history . 
  avram iancu still aliv in romania !, 
  seems about right . 
  the tr-85 are in larger numbers but not as modern . 
  i wonder if they 'll ramp up the production now . 
  u wot m8 ?

  if you think russia would let go if you try to move in a neutral sphere , you 're dead wrong . 
  for romania at least , it 's the usa or bust . 
  we 're not very keen on being in the influence sphere of the russians ... and we will be if we try to stand on our own or go for a lower power . 
  for romania it is n't the same as for our slavic neighbours , russia is n't our bigger brother ... and will ( and has ) acted accordingly . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtscroyym-y ) . 
  greece might try and ship immigrants to germany , but it will be nothing compared to what china can do !,

  the title is kinda misleading . 
  it implies an immediate mobilization . 
  from what i understand you 're saying , the decision that was taken was to start the bureaucratic proceedings for a military draft in case of emergency . 
  regarding this subject , in recent times something similar to this happened in romania . 
  the authorities approved the medical form that would be presented by all men between the ages of 20 to 35 for their military draft in case of war . 
  the law which stipulated that in case of war , mobilization or state of siege all men between 20 and 35 would be drafted is a little older tho , from 2006 . 
  [ hope this helps . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lughnasadh ) it 's a little off the mark geographically but it is in august . 
  ca n't wait for romania to join the eurozone and make an [ avram iancu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avram_iancu ) commemorative coin . 
  fun times ahead . 
  do n't worry . 
  it 's in the nature of romanians to be suspicious and question anything good that 's happening to them . 
  ( i was only half joking about that ), 
  atleast we have broken that circle .

  i think they should stay , the eu is like a gang , you ca n't turn your back on it . 
  you did n't choose the union life , the union life chose you . 
  as for it 's current behavior , i think the government in power now acts like a child throwing a hissy fit , saying this and that and having an antagonizing attitude which does n't help at all , they should focus more of their energy on solutions . 
  as for the responsibility , i think the greek government that was prior and during the crisis are more to blame . 
  although i ca n't fault the greeks themselves for being mad , it 's not easy going through that kind of upheaval and austerity , through increase in unemployment and reduction in life quality . 
  that 's my take on it anyway . 
  meanwhile the neighbours are watching enthralled by the spectacle .

  it 's not wrong ... those are n't mistakes , it 's just another way of saying it . 
  both are accepted [ in english ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moldavian ) . 
  and it 's irrelevant how it 's spelled in russian since we 're talking about english , and even if it was borrowed from russian ( which i very much doubt is it 's origin in english ) it still would n't be wrong . 
  it 's far more likely that the english origin is derived from french ( see [ r\u00e9publique de moldavie ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavie ) . ), 
  who in turn takes it from proto-german . 
  actually the official name is the republic of moldova . 
  informal moldova , since it 's shorter which is interchangeable in english , as i 've said above , with moldavia [ like here ] ( http://www.moldova.org/leader-of-national-republican-party-moldavian-president-does-not-know-what-to-do-8239-eng/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.thefreelibrary.com/moldavian+authorities+deny+kyrgyz+human+rights+activist+edil+baisalov...-a0204776102 ) . 
  the informal way was used at the start when you first replied . 
  in english it 's interchangeable . 
  the country 's name is indeed the republic of moldova , with the informal name moldova ... which is interchangeable with moldavia ** in english ** .
