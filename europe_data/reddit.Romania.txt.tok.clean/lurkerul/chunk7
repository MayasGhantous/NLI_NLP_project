  while it 's true that it is a historic state and short-lived it still it has no effect on the fact that that 's the way it was named in english . 
  yes , but my argument is that the `` moldova '' way of saying it in english is borrowed from the romanian , since we never had in romanian the `` moldavia '' moniker first attributed to the historical kingdom , meaning that it was exclusively used by languages other than romanian . 
  following that train of thought , why is it wrong to use it 's term to call something that is named using the romanian language if you are speaking in said language and not in romanian ? 
  is n't the [ moldavian democratic republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavian_democratic_republic ) example , which is not the medieval kingdom nor the soviet satellite republic , proof that the english language juggles with the terms ? 
  that 's because i was using the english moniker , since i was using the english language . 
  that 's like being pissed off at a german because , while he 's conversing in german , he said rum\u00e4nien instead of the romanian language 's romania . 
  again ... moldova/moldavian are just two variants of the name in english ... the same way with armor/armour . 
  it is n't the same thing as saying `` ukraine '' or `` the ukraine '' , as i 've shown with the [ moldavian democratic republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavian_democratic_republic ) translation in english . 
  that name was given by english speakers to it prior to the soviet union even existing , therefore it is n't something coined by the soviets . 
  also , as / u/bezbojnicul pointed out in romanian there is only moldova , both moldova and moldavia can refer to the principality ( or kingdom ) , the region that is now in romania or to the geopolitical entity that exists today which got it 's name from those 2 above , which in romanian is `` republica moldova '' . 
  hope this clears up what i 'm trying to explain . 
   you become disrespectful of the opinions of others and expect what , a pat on the back ? 
  that was n't being condescending i was telling you flat out that there is no soviet connotation to that turn of phrase used an you were seeing a problem that is n't there . 
  also : condescension \u02cck\u0252nd\u026a\u02c8s\u025bn\u0283n / noun an attitude of patronizing superiority ; disdain . 
  maybe you know what that means now . 
  ( see ? 
  now i was being condescending ... see the difference ? ), 
   i think you need to learn how to have adult discussions without taking a giant dump all over them . 
  i see ... i did n't know that daring to speak when you do n't agree is considered disrespectful . 
  i do n't like your condescending manner . 
   well , since you 're neither moldovan nor from any other part of the ussr , i fail to see how you 'd know anything about soviet connotations . 
  i do n't know if you 're trying to be an asshole or if you do n't know history . 
  edit : also ... i happen to be moldavian ( or moldovan if you 're so gung-ho about it ) , my parents are from botosani , and there 's about as much difference culturally and ethnically between the moldavians on either side of the prut as there is difference between purple and mauve . 
  from what i know , it 's an assortment of those , plus some who view themselves as romanians . 
  there were a few scandals in the media here because authorities from transnistria were putting pressure on schools that taught romanian and harassing those who worked in them . 
  that 's what reminded us that we have a diaspora there . 
  not really ... you could see what kind of a guy he was . 
  that time when he took a swig out of a champagne bottle and then shattered it on the pavement happened early in his first . 
  also , remember golden blitz . 
  shots fired . 
  i know . 
  not trying to generalize . 
  if it appears so , then i apologize , that was not my intention . 
  no ... it 's just an alternative for it in english ... see the [ moldavian democratic republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavian_democratic_republic ) . 
  see anything sovietic there ? 
  only you see the sovietic connotation there . 
  i know there is anti-soviet and anti-russian sentiment among ukrainians now ... we should know , we always had it , but this is getting ridiculous . 
  edit : also , if i wanted to refer to it as a region , i 'd just call it basarabia . 
  wtf ? 
  moldavia is a way to write and pronounce it in english . 
  that 's like me being butthurt because the germans call our country `` rum\u00e4nien '' or the serbs `` rumunija '' . 
  chill the fuck out . 
  russia has treated moldavia as it 's playground for some time now . 
  only recently did it get any opposition from the other side or from moldavia itself . 
  so no ... they do n't have nearly enough power as a state to counteract that influence . 
  that 's interesting stuff there ... thanks for posting it :d, 
  `` thanks iohannis !, 
  you could try browsing / r/romania ( shameless plug here ) or use [ this guide ] ( http://kingofromania.com/2010/04/21/how-i-learned-romanian-in-37-easy-steps/ ) . 
  pimsleur has romanian lessons if you wan na go hardcore at it ... but it 's not as fun as the first two options . 
  da ... it would help if you knew other romance languages , makes things easier . 
  did you learn from your parents ?

  oh , blow me . 
  should n't you be crying `` revise trianon '' at this hour , ya frustrated xenophobe ? 
  i 'm starting to get pissed off now ... i literally smacked my face at how logic seems to not affect the way you make your arguments and counter - arguments . 
   the archangel gabriel brought god 's word to mohammed without altering it . 
  if he did alter it , i do n't think god would be very well thinking of his archangels ...  see above : the third party did not alter it . 
  ffs we are not discussing whether or not the message was unaltered by the third party . 
  i did not contest that . 
   if i told you something here , does this mean it would n't be my words ? 
  we are doing this through the third party called reddit , by your logic nothing i said here would be my direct words . 
  i 'm sorry ... but i ca n't phrase this any differently : are you daft ? 
  reddit is n't a third party . 
  third party : a person other than the principals < a third party to a divorce proceeding  < insurance against injury to third parties  direct [ usually before noun ] involving only the two people or things mentioned and with no one or nothing else coming in between gabriel is god 's messenger . 
  the holy spirit is one aspect of god . 
  literally god . 
  he is part of the trinity . 
  the trinity in theological terms means one god in three persons , `` and in their relations with one another , they are stated to be one in all else , co-equal , co-eternal and consubstantial , and `` each is god , whole and entire '' . 
  nope ... still sticking to it . 
  we 've almost caught up economically and we 're growing . 
  politically ... the romanian political scene is shit , but when i look at hungary , well ... you guys almost make us thankful . 
  that 's about all that would 've been debatable . 
   a package is something different . 
  if you had to write a paper , but your brother plagiarized the paper of person x which you submit , you are submitting person x ' paper , even though you got it from a ` third party ' . 
   mohammed got the word of god through gabriel , but gabriel simply gave mohammed the exact words of god . 
  mohammed did n't get them from god , but they 're still exactly what god said . 
  it 's . 
  still . 
  indirect . 
  since . 
  that . 
  determined . 
  the . 
  manner . 
  it 's . 
  delivery . 
  third party . 
  also ... the same can be said about the bible , yet the bible is n't considered by you and a few others here to be on par with the quran when it comes to it 's `` directness '' . 
   yes , but i am talking about the general consensus . 
  the idea that the bible was not the direct word of god , but instead written by people over the course of centuries who were inspired by god is the most prevailing interpretation . 
  you just agreed that people disagree on the idea of the bible being direct or indirect as the word of god , yet you then say that consensus has been reached on the matter and that said consensus is that it is n't the direct word of god . 
  you ca n't have consensus , even general consensus , if people all over the place disagree on a subject .
