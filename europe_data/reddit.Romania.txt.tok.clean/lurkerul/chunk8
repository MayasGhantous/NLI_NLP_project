   no , it is n't . 
  gabriel said to mohammed exactly what god said to gabriel . 
  god did n't say exactly what to the writers of the bible , he inspired them . 
  again , it does n't matter , since what influences that is the manner of the delivery , not the precision of the retelling by the one who delivers it . 
  in this case , indirect since a third party was involved . 
   the holy spirit did not tell the writers of the bible what to write down , he only ` inspired ' them . 
  yes it did ... since they would n't have wrote it that way if the holy spirit was n't involved . 
  you 're mistaking the kind of `` inspired '' as if the holy spirit was a muse ... which is plain wrong since the holy spirit had a hand in what they wrote . 
  to be more exact , theologically , the holy spirit ** intervened ** . 
   nope . 
  mohammed was n't inspired by gabriel what to write down , he was told exactly what to write down by gabriel . 
  that is the difference . 
  the holy spirit did not tell the writers of the bible what to write down , he only ` inspired ' them . 
  when we say ` inspired ' we mean that the holy spirit did n't say anything to them , he sort of implanted the ideas of what would become the bible in their heads . 
  not literally , but that is the best way i can explain it . 
  again ... that 's not inspiration , that 's intervention . 
  and it 's a scant difference if the holy spirit implanted in the minds of men the ideas and the archangel gabriel told mohammed the ideas , the difference is only in the vocalization . 
  also gabriel * revealed * to mohammed the teachings of god over a long period of time , mohammed 's companions acted as scribes , writing what revelations mohammed had . 
   again : he did n't tell them anything . 
  does n't . 
  matter . 
  if there was no vocalization produced by the being who intervened . 
  is it any less direct or less involved if those who were involved in writing did n't receive the information by way of sound going through their ears ?

   you 're correct , although that does n't change anything . 
  the words were still god 's direct words . 
  what ? 
  how can they be direct if it was delivered by a third party ? 
  if i give you a package to give to a friend of mine , and you do ... did i directly give that package to my friend ? 
   yes , they do . 
  it is seen as the word of god , but not the direct word of god . 
  how it 's seen by christians is debatable since faith and interpretation of one 's religion ( and the bible ) is subjective from believer to believer . 
  it 's certainly more direct than gabriel handing it down . 
  see the holy spirit as part of god himself arguement above . 
   ( note the ` inspired ' ) one can say that mohammed was inspired and / or told by gabriel the word of god in the same way that the holy spirit `` inspired '' those who wrote the bible , since we do n't have actual retellings of how the holy spirit `` inspired '' and handed down the word of god , or under what guise , since there were more people who were involved in writing the scriptures , which is not the case with gabriel and mohammed . 
   it did n't work like that . 
  i know the holy spirit is part of god , but god did n't literally tell them what to write down . 
  he inspired them what to write down indirectly . 
  this makes the bible not the direct literal word of god , but rather as the inspired word of god . 
  again ... the whole `` inspired '' arguement above . 
  also ... you ca n't get more direct than part of god ( a.i. 
  the holy spirit ) telling you what to write , only if god himself appeared . 
  again ... it 's certainly more direct than ** gods messenger ** gabriel . 
  you know what else risks war ? 
  changing borders using military force . 
  also , destabilization . 
  you know what is n't nato military expansion ? 
  moving nato troops in nato countries . 
  and before someone mentions western help to ukraine , i 'd also like to mention russian help for ukraine ... what ? 
  aid is only acceptable and definable as aid only if it comes from one side ? 
  on the subject of expansion , again , the article forgets to mention that nato ca n't force countries to join ... it does n't gobble up countries ( unlike russia ) . 
  one enters nato if one chooses to . 
  the article also forgets to mention that ukraine was on the fence regarding nato before the russian aggression ... it was neutral . 
  it is n't anymore ... it wants to join nato ... whose fault is that ? 
  edit : corrected a typo . 
  where is this majority of religious experts that have reached consensus on that ... that `` agree '' on that ? 
  also ... what your saying is n't completely correct . 
  gabriel appeared to mohammed and told him what to write , not god himself . 
  also ... christians do see the writings of the bible as the word of god , but it is n't uniformly interpreted in a literal way . 
  but let 's follow your arguement 's line : if the bible was written by men who were under the guidance of the holy spirit , then it was the word of god handed to them by god , since the holy spirit is part of god ( see holy trinity ) . 
  the quran on the other hand was , again , written by mohammed who was guided by gabriel , the archangel . 
  now , again ... using your argument , which of the two have a more direct connection to god in their handing down as the word of god ? 
  should n't it be the liver ? 
  you know , since it has an important job , but no matter how battered it is it regenerates , or if a piece is removed it grows back ? 
  ( also because beer ... lots and lots of beer ) . 
  i believe he 's mocking the double standard of that phrase . 
  the bible , from a theological standpoint , was written by prophets ( ? 
  or holy men ) under the holy spirit 's influence / guidance . 
  the quran , again from a theological standpoint , was , as he said relayed by gabriel to mohammed ... the prophet ... who wrote it down . 
  so ... reading that ... the bible was written by men , but the quran is  the final and unalterable manifestation of gods will on earth . 
  see the problem ? 
  cultists ... greece confirmed as chaos corrupted . 
  heresy .

  no . . it 's about nationality , which is a conundrum since both ethnicities which are n't really different ethnicities have separate countries ... but then again those who are both moldavians and romanians in ukraine should count towards romania since their parents and grandparents were of the romanian ethnicity and nationality before the soviet union rolled in . 
  although it also depends on when the map was made . 
  more and more people from moldova who declared themselves moldavians are starting to declare themselves romanian . 
  there 's been a sharp increase in that as of late , in the more recent statistics . 
  also ... in ukraine the moldovan and romanian ethnicities are counted separate . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  you have been doing that for quite awhile , why stop now ? 
  and the serbs ... and the croatians ... every neighbour except austria ( which was n't really a neighbour ) . 
  piss poor treatment and attitude of their historical ethnic minorities is why hungary was hated by almost all its neighbours . 
  i see things have n't changed much .
