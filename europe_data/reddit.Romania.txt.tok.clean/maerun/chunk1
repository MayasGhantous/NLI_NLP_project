[ why wo n't you notice me , senpai ? ], 
  they 're like the danish gyllenhaal . 
  you 'll have to pardon his french . 
  you heard him , there aint no mafia !, 
  now get ` attahere before you accidentally get your kneecaps busted !, 
  * newsflash * : german party reaches russian levels of popularity !, 
  yeah , i skipped that image , you were right . 
   particle accelerator ~ ~ yeah , that 'd be the day . 
  that thing you 're probably looking at is accelerating at half a meter an hour and we still managed to lose one . ~ ~ edit : nevermind , i was looking at the boring machine , had to check again to see the medical device . 
  also found out we actually do have a little cern-like particle accelerator at m\u0103gurele . 
  i dun goofed bad . 
  relevant username . 
  i 'm not sure if little green men is what they are looking for right now . 
  surprising ? 
  i really do n't think we 're as different as others would have us believe . 
  the devil is inspecting his brimstone pits , followed by his attendant . 
  first , he arrives at the british area and he sees 100 feet high walls surrounding the damned . 
  `` these guys love freedom , boss . 
  we had to raise the fence to keep them in '' . 
  afterwards , he reaches the germans , where barbed wires and menacing spikes are being set up . 
  `` these ones are clever , sir . 
  we had to improvise to keep them from escaping '' . 
  following that , the devil sees an unguarded pit , with no fence or posts . 
  `` what about these , why is there no one watching them ? '', 
  `` these are romanians , boss , no need to !, 
  as soon as one of them manages to find a way out , the others pull him right back in . '', 
  as in , time to call the germans again ? 
  or russia could do what they know best , send them to siberia . 
  i mean , there are like 3 people per square kilometer living there , it 's not like they would bother anyone . 
  what then ? 
  s\u00e1pmi , north pole ? 
  it would be amazing if they reach the norwegian shores and just start boarding ships and head out to iceland and greenland . 
  come on , that 's not entirely true !, 
  we also have plenty of machedons , lipovans , some bulgarians , greeks and jews in dobrogea . 
  i do n't know why the romanian minority keeps spreading unfounded stereotypes . 
  fear not , for allah is also a serb . 
  could be worse , some of us only discovered gdp in 1850 . 
  * congratulations , here are your medals !, 
  * * wait , there was a contest ? 
  yeah , poland , stop oppressing the kremlin 's coffers !, 
  what if this gold was stolen by nazis from lw\u00f3w , pi\u0144sk , stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w or other historic russian cities ? 
  [ similar talks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_and_moldova ) have been going on with moldova , which has been trying to maintain its neutrality but might someday be forced to choose sides . 
  basically , if it were for moldova to be considered as a member of nato , it should be willing to forfeit [ transnistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) and be able to hold territorial integrity before even being considered as a candidate . 
  [ further criteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_nato#criteria_and_process ) would follow before admittance , but this appears to be a bare minimum . 
  cheer up , maybe now you wo n't be known for dreadful basements anymore !, 
  * up to 50 middle-eastern refugees die from gas poisoning in a truck in central europe . 
  * now this is a depressing piece of news that i never imagined i would be reading in 2015 . 
  also , your [ average height ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ltyrnpk.jpg ) is rising at the rate with which your country is sinking . 
  remember , remember ... the 23rd of august ? 
  atreides , maybe ? 
  * laughs romaniacally *, 
  the ukraine is gone . 
  well , only the '' * the * '' is gone , the rest still stands . 
  well , that did n't take long . 
  after greek ministers , we might have russian oligarchs , romanian politicians and chinese magnates to diversify the email scamming scene . 
  you are right about the large countries , but i think that a * perceived * external threat still holds sway over people 's feeling towards the military . 
  smaller nations are just as steadfast in regards to their soverignty but are more willing to compromise when they lack the economic strength to protect their borders . 
  if people felt more secure in the east , i 'm willing to bet that they would be more reluctant to foreign military on their soil . 
  i can see that support declines the further away you move from russia . 
  except for scandinavia , which makes sense , and for france , which does n't . 
  [ damn romanians !, 
  they ruined romania ! ], 
  good point !, 
  you 're right . 
  people are n't intolerant * because * religion tells them that ( if anything , holy texts usually promote peace and coexistence ) , but the church gives them an excuse not to change their ideas . 
  `` god never meant two people of the same sex to be together , i 'm not an asshole , he is and he 's right . '', 
  communist romania was ( in theory at least ) an atheist state and promoted similar ideas regarding what 's `` normal '' . 
  a friend of mine said that communist parties had to remove the clergy because they we 're basically competing with each other towards telling people how they should live their lives and whom they should worship . 
  when there is an lgbt parade here , a lot of police officers are mustered to protect people from flying crosses and those who protest are accompanied by priests in robes . 
  sure , some atheists may be against it too , but they do n't actively try to harm those who think differently , it 's almost always the religious zealots that go that far . 
  so , yeah , i think organized religion here is the biggest enabler of manifesting backwards mentality . 
  religion stronk !, 
  but seriously , old habits die hard but they do wither out eventually . 
  i see more people giving less crap about what bigoted , corrupt , hypocritical priests have to say and i think they 'll care even less about how other people choose to live their lives . 
  hopefully , sooner rather than later . 
  same thing here , if you do n't make a pi bond with another gender , you 're prone to having a second sigma bond , which is unconstitutional . 
  in eastern europe , you do n't brag about how well you 're doing , but about how worse off you are . 
  i remember that talks after pta meetings were like dozens of different fundraisers raising awareness among themselves . 
  `` and then things got worse . '', 
  just a man with a properly defined career ; nothing to see , move along . 
  i heard it 's already flooded with tourists . 
  actually , french supermarkets like carrefour and auchan are a bit more expensive than german ones , like kaufland , lidl and metro ag . 
  they do have a broader variety of products , though , like country-specific cuisine and wine . 
  well , my great-grandfather always said they would come . 
  he was off by only 50 years . 
  no , it 's fer , [ remember ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f4nbzeb.png ) ? 
  eesti is a small enough country , they might blitz right past it and [ hookup ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t3g6lpj.jpg ) with the russians playing hide and seek in the baltic . 
  when the swedes [ found one near stockholm ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30056037 ) , they went searching for evidence . 
  finns do n't mess around !, 
  i 'm actually surprised to see there is no green in south-east romania , there are plenty of mosques in [ dobrogea ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/musulmani_romania_%282002%29.png ) . 
  czech ... mate atheists ? 
  you could ask les allemands for some tips & tricks . 
  i dunno , the contrast is pretty clear to me . 
  glory to arstotzka !, 
  the netherlands have denounced russia , warning the world they are not to be trusted . 
  good idea , wrong post . 
  try this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30lgv1/map_of_europes_unesco_world_heritage/,
