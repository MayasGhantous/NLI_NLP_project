  but experts doubt russia could muster such a force . '', 
  who wastes resources on training and equipment when you have more ~ ~ cannon fodder ~ ~ soldiers than they have bullets ? 
  looks like the ragnar\u00f6k edition : * i tell you the truth , unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood , no valkyries will come for you !, 
  i doubt mindless hatred has a nationality . 
  that 's just messed up . 
  i 'm not even sure you have n't started that yet . 
  you know , in case the uk and usa try a cultural victory . 
  yeah , [ we heard that before ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin_americanii ! ), 
  i , for one , welcome our ~ ~ old ~ ~ new german overlords . 
  if sweden ever goes for it , i hope they find a way to immortalize [ this royal figure ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lepih6n.jpg ) on their coins .

  it 's fantastic !, 
  if he played the russian campaign from empire earth , then gods help us all when he appoints [ mecha-putin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iz5oxjw.jpg ) as his successor . 
  take a deep breath , [ read this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_war ) ( or at least skim it ) and imagine that current events might merely be a continuation of that . 
  more than four decades of escalation and crises did not lead to the end of the world . 
  russians may be intimidating , but they 're by no means [ stupid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident ) . 
  and , who knows , this time around we might see a race to mars and beyond !, 
  my thoughts fell on rain and plain , mainly . 
  reminds me of that joke where putin calls the polish government to offer his condolences for their loss in the air crash in smolensk . 
  he is told that the plane is n't supposed to take off for another hour , to which he curses their daylight saving nonsense and hangs up . 
  in belarus , tram loves you !,

  judging greeks like that because of [ these morons ] ( http://www.dailystormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/a-golden-dawn-supporter-r-014.jpg ) is the same as anybody else comparing all germans to [ these pricks ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/picserver4/2014/11/17/5702690/57026880990100640360no.jpg ) .

  i think it 's unfair to judge a whole nation based on their government and the stupid ideas that they have . 
  i know that ( at least in theory ) democratic states are representative of the population that chose them , but i feel like in each election , i cast a vote of confidence that , hopefully , those guys wo n't go complete apeshit afterwards . 
  is that why sneaky little submarines [ have been poking ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30056037 ) sexy swedish waters ? 
  or why big white bombers [ have been penetrating ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/01/raf-russian-bomber-uk-airspace ) the luscious british airspace ?

  hell , i 'm still hoping his predecessor gets to rest in a prison cell before resting in peace . 
  as little impact as it would have right now , it would still be a symbolic gesture . 
  that 's mostly just the recent outcry regarding one austrian company , holzindustrie schweighofer , who was involved in a lot of [ illegal deforestation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holzindustrie_schweighofer#controversy ) . 
  it 's similar to how gabriel resources put a dent in the public sentiment towards canada , due to their lobbying for [ a potentially very damaging ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ro%c8%99ia_montan%c4%83_project#environment ) mining operation in the carpathian mountains . 
  most people are wise enough to realise that a company from any given country will look for profit , regardless of means , and that it is our own corrupt officials ' fault for enabling them . 
  * most * people ... 
  could be worse . 
  at least in their culture those scarfs are mandatory . 
  this way , i know how to avoid them and not wear the wrong colours . 
  i was told not to wear anything provoking , so that i will be left alone . 
  is it like the difference between castle and palace , respectively ? 
  the further to the west you are , the less scary this is . 
  there might be [ another reason ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4e7qccn.png ) for denmark 's irrelevance . 
  it 's one of those exceedingly rare second world solutions : too noteworthy to get conquered . 
  not noteworthy enough to get bombed . 
  feels like walking on a tightrope . 
  south-east europe is only relevant when they 're late on the eu-rent . 
  this explains our op 's . 
  we should actually host a referendum . 
  it appears only politicians are in a hurry to get rid of it . 
  they 're quite terrible at making friends , are n't they ? 
  i 've waited far too long for that gif to load . 
  i guess some calculations take a little longer . 
  thanks for the perspective , but i do n't see how their reasons justify their course of action . 
  if people started using taxis as their main means of transportation and bus drivers started blocking taxi queuing areas , i do n't think they 'd be understanding and i would n't blame them . 
  if they already own cars and their business is n't lucrative anymore , what keeps them from using the uber platform themselves ? 
  and if this business model works well without said regulations , then maybe the existing rules are pertaining to antiquated reasons that are n't relevant anymore . 
  we are n't talking about medical services , after all . 
  when commercial trains and airplanes started using the same railways and air strips , respectively , there have been protests and strikes from state-run company unions but nobody hindered or physically threatened private employees . 
  i think that this whole thing looks rather similar to how big isps run their monopolies in countries such as the usa , i.e. 
  lobbying heavily and blocking competition in any way possible , all the while being unwilling to change their services towards the benefit their customers . 
  that 's the main reason they get no sympathy from me . 
  that , and their [ utterly stupid ] ( https://youtu.be/l1c4fgyovla ) way of [ protesting ] ( https://youtu.be/chqllhwxy9o ) . 
  how little they care about people 's opinion ( including their own customers ) really speaks volumes about the situation in which they find themselves right now . 
  the sad thing is that many , if not most of them , will never understand how it was their own undoing . 
  how come being a taxi driver transcends cultural boundaries in terms of customer service ? 
  or does it only plague some big cities ? 
  just your typical easter-european self-loathing . 
  we do n't tend to leave small things like actual improving living conditions get in the way of good discontent . 
  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy . 
  well , this is one way to ensure that refugees leave scandinavia ... of their own accord . 
  / r/rocirclejerk / and do n't worry , we would n't download a car because we do n't have highways on which to drive them . 
  it was just a joke , not implying anything . 
  if i were to make a guess , i would imagine there are mostly historical reasons , maybe similar to how some countries ' names end in - reich and - land in german . 
  countries you have n't had much contact with or appeared in their current state rather recently seem to get more generic names . 
  so ... you do n't really consider your bordering neighbours as ` countries ' , do you ? 
  edit : guys , i was just joking a little , not tryanon to suggest anything !, 
  we are n't a poor country because we lack resources . 
  we are poor because we do n't manage resources in an efficient manner . 
  just throwing more capital at the economy will not miraculously improve it . 
  and before you say it 's the political class ' fault only , keep in mind that there is a systematic problem at all government levels . 
  basically , corruption , bureaucracy and inefficiency are dragging us down severely . 
  as for funds , we had the [ highest contracting rate ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/eu-funds-absorption-romania/151361/ ) but the [ lowest eu funds absorption ] ( http://sar.org.ro/en/sar-analyst-compares-romanias-eu-fund-performance-with-poland-and-evaluate-the-lessons-learned/ ) just a couple of years ago . 
  there are city-wide projects and national civil works that get started but miss their deadlines by years or get cancelled altogether . 
  that gold is n't going anywhere and it only gets more valuable as time goes by . 
  let 's leave it up to a future generation to do something useful with it , right now we 'd only squander it . 
  it 's not worth it . 
  aside from the environmental damage , it probably would n't help much , even if it would n't end up in anyone 's pocket . 
  whenever there 's any money to spare , the idiots in charge have no clue what to do with it , do wasteful investments that require a ton of bribing to get on the way or flat out refuse to do anything while they are being monitored regarding their spending . 
  i say we should let the gold stay buried and invest in tourism in the area instead . 
  or infrastructure . 
  or just about anything else that would benefit long-term . 
  classical music , psychiatry , skiing and omv . 
  here , i think austrians get about the same preconceptions that germans do , hard-working , disciplined , strict etc. 
  recently , some austrian enterprises have been caught doing shady business and that might have put a dent in people 's opinion . 
  i 've only met an austrian once and , although i studied german in school , i could n't understand one word she spoke .
