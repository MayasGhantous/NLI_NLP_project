  ** romania ** * chevron suspended shale gas exploration plan after protests . 
  [ \\ [ 1 \\ ] ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/chevron-shale-gas-exploration-omanian-pungesti ) * romania threatens to block the canada-eu trade deal unless ottawa lifts the visa requirements for romanians . 
  [ \\ [ 2 \\ ] ] ( http://euobserver.com/foreign/121896 ) * it was revealed that in 2011 rmgc promised to `` donate '' $ 70mil to the ministry of culture if they gave the final authorization for starting the mining project . 
  basically a legal bribe .

   the czech republic had a visa-free regime from 2007 until 2009 , when ottawa decided to reintroduce visas due to the large number of roma asylum seekers coming from the czech side . 
  i expect that even if the visas get lifted for romanians , in the end we 'll get the same treatment anyway ... 
  it 's easier to send all of the gypsies back here and then blame us for not helping them than it is for them to find solutions ( and this is valid for other european countries like france and the uk ) . 
  not to mention the chief of the geological institute has just been fired through a morning fax . 
  it would n't be that outrageous if he had n't been the one that last week strongly opposed the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 mining project and accused rmgc of forging maps and soil samples . 
  the gala\u021bi earthquakes were apparently caused both because of the heavy rains and because of the petroleum exploitation in the area . 
  [ [ link ] ] ( http://www.realitatea.net/seismologul-care-a-prezit-cutremurul-din-77-a-dezlegat-misterul-din-galati_1283046.html ) and wow , how could i forget about the well-deserved sentence of voiculescu ? 
  * the protests against the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 mining project are continuing . 
  * chevron received authorization to build the first fracking station of our country . 
  * medicinal marijuana was legalized . 
  * the stray dogs law has been adopted but has not been truly enforced . 
  * our pm was accused of another plagiarism . 
  * france does n't want us to join the schengen area . 
  * there was cold weather , precipitation of up to 80l/sqm and 50-60 kph winds during the first half of the week . 
  * ... and we had a magnitude 5.5 earthquake last night which woke up the southern and eastern parts of the country at 4:40 in the morning . 
  even us in romania got some snow in the carpathians at 2000m ...

  we 've also been a francophile country , proof being that a significant part of our vocabulary is borrowed from french . 
  we also borrow the french pronunciation of words that are originally from english . 
  ( e.g. 
  sandwich - we do n't pronounce `` sand-witch '' but more like `` san-viche '' . ), 
  also , it always surprises foreigners that we do n't use the cyrillic alphabet , unlike our neighbors , bulgaria and the ukraine . 
  aw , yeah , look at that clean air in our carpathian mountains . 
  i think you should only care about * the individual 's sensitivities * . 
  if you have a muslim friend who is very conservative but otherwise a nice guy then maybe do n't wear that `` anal rape '' t-shirt when you go with him to the movies ... 
  it 's like that doug stanhope bit about `` support the troops '' . 
  maybe one guy is an asshole who kicks ducks up the arse and i do n't want to support him , but i want to support the other guy who is nice to ducks and feeds them seeds . 
  i 've cycled through sweden and norway this summer and road signs are pretty rare . 
  if you 're not familiar with the area you definitely need at least a map . 
  but i get it , they are often an unnecessary cost - and the roads are great so the money is going in the right places - and they would take away a bit from the awesome scenery . 
  he did it before !, 
  he should resign , any sensible person with a bit of decency would . 
  so he probably will not !, 
  my guess is he 'll repeat his stupid narrative that * he 's been elected by millions of people so he must keep his post for them * , referring to the people who voted for him at the presidential elections . 
  edit : i know that as a pm he 's not elected , i 'm just showing his stupid logic . 
  the confused-boner junkie-hot , like courtney love or 2011 lindsay lohan . 
  i suddenly feel the need to go back to school . 
  oh , nope , it 's an erection . 
  the english doctor says : - in the uk our medical system is so advanced you get a kidney from one guy , put it in the other and after 3 weeks he 's already looking for work . 
  the german guy laughs and says : - that 's not a big deal . 
  in germany you can get half a heart from one guy , put it in another guy and in 2 weeks they 're * both * looking for work . 
  the romanian guy scoffs and says : - oh yeah !? 
  well that 's nothing . 
  we got a guy off the street with no heart or brains , made him prime-minister and now we 're * all * looking for work !, 
  well , i get them not wanting to stay in greece or romania because they can have access to better education , higher wages and improved standards of living in germany ... 
  but come on , if you get the chance to stay in any of these top countries you 're set !, 
  the differences are not that huge . 
  i do n't know much about the election , maybe it was all legit , but its not the first time an authoritarian government has been instituted through `` democratic '' election . 
  [ you ca n't trust his actions or know what his true end goals are . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/wcy8uljrhpm ), 
  hmm ... 
  i guess his removal would create further instability in the country which could actually help isis . 
  it 's not a straightforward problem but one thing is for sure - i do n't trust the involvement of russia . 
  wait a second . 
  is n't assad the bad guy here ? 
  i 'm not too familiar with the civil war in syria but he seems like a ruthless dictator , why is it a good thing to be kept in power ? 
  do norwegians think oslo is ugly ? 
  i was there this year and it was kind of * meh * . 
  i hoped it would be as nice as stockholm but it was far from it - the rest of the country * is * gorgeous though . 
  osterreich - the kingdom of cheese ? 
  what romanians call * br\u00e2nz\u0103 * are all the types of [ white cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_cheese ) , especially '' [ sirene/sirenje ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sirene ) '' cheese . 
  many of these are further differentiated by source ( of cow , of sheep , from sibiu , etc ) . 
  * ca\u0219caval * is the blanket term for yellow cheeses ... 
  on / r/romania we have a flair for `` editorials '' , which is reserved for opinion columns , blog drivel etc. 
  this way you know what to expect . 
  in a way it 's good because you do n't want to have an echo chamber that just confirms your opinions and does n't challenge your views . 
  sometimes it 's drivel , but the point is to see more sides to a story . 
  you know you 're romanian when your subreddit has a special flair for `` prison '' . 
  ayyyy lmao i 'll take that crazy limo on the right wooo, 
  baklaban for vatican !, 
  russia is also a home of bureaucracy . 
  but besides being slow and convoluted , their system is also extremely corrupt !, 
  actually the public spending went down so we started getting a surplus from last year . 
  but tax evasion is starting to go down and corruption is also going down because of all the arrests so the surplus was even greater than expected . 
  this vat cut should really help the economy in the long run and decrease the tax evasion in the agriculture sector . 
  we still have the laser , but the gypsies use it to melt scrap iron . 
  you do n't leave the gas on if you go out ... 
  [ hey , larry david , how is the euro in lithuania ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36bvyc_odrm ), 
   plain awesome * pretty * awesome ftfy, 
  i was n't really serious , of course it 's a different matter if you grow up with it . 
  but i have experience with both german and swedish and yet when i tried dutch it was so unintuitive that even the basics were impossible to get . 
  i tried to learn the basics on duolingo to surprise my dutch friends . 
  fuhgeddaboutit ... unintuitive writing and the pronunciation is half phlegm . 
  :( which is weird because i like hearing them talk . 
  yup , that 's where the op on / r/romania got it from .
