well , yeah , there is n't , the roman aquila and basarab 's eagle are basically unrelated , but the eagle was gradually changed to become an aquila when romanian national ideals started growing and the roman empire became an important factor of these ideas . 
  [ the republic of moldova ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/coat_of_arms_of_moldova.svg ) 's got an aquila , too . 
  well , the [ roman aquila ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aquila_ ( roman ) , as it can be traced to the roman empire , actually kinda puts together all the different symbols ( moldova , transylvania , banat , dobrogea and walacchia ) because it 's a symbol of our latin-based language , the thing that holds us together the most and makes us stand out in the region . 
  well obviously our glorious [ roman aquila ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg/640px-coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg.png ) - sort-of-eagle , that 's been our [ symbol ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/coat_of_arms_of_wallachia_voivodship.png ) since the middle ages ... kinda . 
  from the wiki on the unification of ro and md :  according to a poll conducted by the romanian institute for evaluation and strategy on 29 november 2013 , 76 % of romanians agree with the union of romania and moldova , while only 18 % oppose a possible union . 
  other polls show support going up to 85 % . 
  as for stefan the great he was kinda `` meh '' in an international context like most of romanian and moldovan rulers have been , sadly ... 
  please stop blaming everything on propaganda . 
  something like 25 % of moldovan citizens speak russian as their mothertongue , he might very well be one of them , or he has russian friends/relatives/etc ; for moldovans russians are like hungarians are for transylvanian romanians , everybody 's got a hungarian friend/relative there . 
  and no , it was part of romania from 1918 to 1940 and the thing was only partially internationally recognized . 
  it might have been part of romania as in `` the romanian culture group of romanian-speaking people '' but that 's kinda it . 
  if by basserabia you 're referring to southern basserabia ( west odessa ) then nobody here wants it , romanians/moldovans have always beena minority there and really no one here desires to have a war with russia and ukraine over a pretty useless piece of land that does n't even mean something to us , not even with the help of nato , we 've already got our own problems , and , unlike putin , would like to first solve them before warmongering . 
  that being said , if by basserabia you refer to the current moldovan republic , then yeah , around 70/80 % of romanians would want to unify , but only if moldovans agree as well and without transnistria and gagauzia , we do n't want regions that have a russian or ukranian majority ( that also speaks russian ) causing problems in our country . 
  man , i think i 'm in love with that shia lady , dhe seems very intelligent , cunning and reasonable . 
  too bad they ca n't get swiss tuna now ... 
  do n't forget that around 40 % of transnistria 's population is moldovan and they have very few rights ( the only romanian-language school is being closed now , sadly ) . 
  i ca n't wait for vaslui to get autonomy , and then alexandria gets independence , and then iasi becomes a cofederation with craiova and then there 's a civil war between satu mare and vama veche , and then botosani takes over everything and romania becomes the granduchy of botosani ... 
  well , i agree with you but the last two kings were kinda more romanian than german , only carol and ferdinand were really germans , born and raised . 
  you should watch tv more then . 
  yesterday at romania tv they were saying literally this , that the fdgr is a nazi organisation loyal to berlin . 
  but ... but ... i 've been told you guys get gulash and paprika and kurtos kolacs ... :(, 
  well , i 've lived in italy for a fair amount of time so that might have influenced me , 
  thanks for the information !, 
  i should start saving some money , then , as i want to also go to electric castle ( a music festival in cluj/koloszvar ) in june with a couple of friends and that costs some money , too . 
  as for sziget , the people attending the festival are mostly foreigners or hungarians ( more importantly , do people speak english there ? 
  ) , as i 'd like to socialize and make some friends and i do n't speak any hungarian except for some very basic things . 
  just to set some things straight : i support him not because he 's a german , not because he 's not orthodox , not because he farts some magic merkel-dust , but because he 's a politician i can kinda trust , he 's done some awesome things in [ sibiu/hermannstadt ] ( http://www.adelin-petrisor.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sibiu.jpg ) and i 'm sure he can make romania better , too . 
  people saying that he must be elected because germans are superior are as ignorant as the ones saying that probably he 's an undercover nazi spy ( there 's a lot of people thinking that ) . 
  so please stop this ethnic-bullshit , i 'd vote for him anyways , no matter if he were german , romanian or even gypsy , i do n't really care as he said a lot of times that he 's a romanian patriot , as he married a romanian and served this country remarkably . 
  hell , his family might have very well lived in romania for longer than mine has . 
  man , that 's so awesome !, 
  i think i 'll go there and check it out next year . 
  any piece of advice ( accomodation and stuff ) you can give me ? 
  thanks !, 
  i guess finnish travelling by car, 
  either english or irish ... 
  hmm , i guess romanian living in germany ... 
  yup , you 're right, 
  yeah , i 'm romanian , 
  well , from experience , 70 % of the moldovan people on youtube are like that . 
  ah , ok , i thought you proposed it for now , as many communist party members do in moldova . 
  i was refering to the image of greater moldova that you posted . 
  there are some differences , especially regarding accents but they 're minimal , it 's like people saying `` texas and maine are completely different culturally , in texas you get bbq at mcdonald 's and in maine you get lobster '' . 
  moldovans generally say : `` the languages are identical but in moldova we speak moldovan and in romania they speak romanian '' . 
  it 's more about national pride , they think it 's a shame that an independent country speaks the language of another country . 
  some would like for romanians to also call the language moldovan ( yes , even in romania ) . 
  ahaha , it would be impossible for the two moldovas to unify , western moldovans are amongst the most fierce romanian patriots and i doubt even 3 % of the population would like to join a much poorer region to which they do n't feel any attachment to and leave romania . 
  it would be like proposing texas to join mexico . 
  it was the ' 90 , so the whole country was going shit and these people came to profit of the pieces of the crumbled state that they could find . 
  the pedophiles probably got gypsy girls off the streets ar even convinced their parents , some horrible stuff . 
  as for the mafia leaders , they were doing `` bussiness '' , money laundering , person traffiking , finding a hub for stolen cars from italy , buying factories for nothing , usual stuff , a policeman in my city actually got shot vey badly ( stood in a coma for a lot of time ) by one of their men ( the guy who pulled the trigger was also italian ), 
  that 's what most romanians do n't seem to understand at all : autonomy is not independence , if we 'd give the sekler land autonomy they 'd stop whining and we could both live our lives calmly . 
  when a romanian hears about autonomy , though , they think about a secession war and ethnic cleansing of romanians . 
  sure that your bikers with great hungary badges riding everywhere in transylvania do n't help a lot , though . 
  the westerners bribed our corrupt officials ( see how putting them in jail works ? ), 
  that now have villas in sardinia and stuff . 
  also they ( along with the romanians that bought factories ) fired litteraly millions of people ( that 's why we have our massive emigration ) and later scrapped the factories . 
  as for the pedophiles , a close relative of mine is a french and german translator who 's specialised in court and judiciary cases and he told me about how many scummy people came to ask for translations for their court cases during the ' 90 , including many pedophiles , scammers , and even some mafia leaders that now are like in top 5 criminals in italy . 
  dude , people in amsterdam seemed so friendly and cool , why are most of you dutch people on the internet so butthurt and act like assholes , do the cool people hang out in pubs all time and only the shitty ones like the internet or what ? 
  also a lot of you westerners , including dutch , helped fuck up romania during the ' 90 , buying giant factories fot like 1000 $ and later became millionares selling the scrap iron or doing other shitty things . 
  also you leaked a considerable amount of pedophiles into romania , coming especially from belgium and the netherlands . 
  so pleaae , get your head out of your ass and let 's drink a beer together . 
  if romania invades and annexes moldova tomorrow to protect `` ethnic romanians '' , if we somehow would n't be bombed into oblivion we 'd be kicked out of the eu and nato , our exports would disappear without any trace and we 'd become poorer than somalia . 
  russia has done whatever they wanted for the past 70 years simply because they knew that nobody was going to even remotely touch them . 
  and as for the bans , they do them randomly every year against ex-urss countries simply to have fun : last year moldovan wine , the year before lithuanian milk and so on . 
  funny thing about the romanian one : the architectural style is actually late neo-classical but you ca n't see all the details from distance ( so almost never in pictures ) because the thing is so damn big , making many think that the style is socialist realism or other communist styles when in fact it 's not ( this might explain the ` terrifying ' part . 
  it 's also 100 % romanian , as all the building materials come from within the country . 
  well , nobody really knows how big the bunkers are as it 's somehow a government secret . 
  many ex-government officials and stuff have said , though , that there are underearth highways connecting the parliment with the defense ministry , gara de nord ( the northern train-station ) and a military place outside of bucharest as ceausescu was super-paranoid about a nuclear attack from the soviets or the us . 
  easily , bearing in mind that it is the world 's heaviest building and second-biggest after the pentagon . 
  it also probably has a bunker network underneath it as big as the building itself , the guys from top gear got to drive their ferraris there but i 'm on mobile and ca n't find a link . 
  personally , not but if you want it you could go hiking in the carpathians , there german seems to be the `` lingua franca '' alongside english , i go hiking every year and the amount of germans , austrians and foreigners in general is insane , maybe 1/3 of the people climbing the peaks are romanian . 
  if you 're not into mountains you can go to the black sea , to vama veche if you 're more of a hippie type of person or to mamaia if you 're into mainstream fun ( it 's kinda like ibiza , with dozens of clubs and discos ) . 
  being german might help you but romanian chicks are kinda more into latin-type of guys ( italian and spanish ) but they sure wo n't mind germans  . 
  well , that 's not really wrong ... sure , the paesants were still dirt poor and the politicians very corrupt , but that ( and carol i 's reign ) was our golden age : all romanians were united , most of the important monuments were built then ( before carol , bucharest , iasi and constanta were only `` big villages '' made of random houses ) , our culture was defined , our literature flowrished and we were considered for the first time a regional power , with a strong diplomacy and very strong ties with france and italy . 
  sure , it sometimes turns into a circlejerk but if you put contemporary , communist and interwar architecture into perspective you 'll see that the interwar one wins in every aspect . 
  also , i 'll have bratianu anytime over ceausescu , basescu , iliescu , ponta , or whoever rules this country now . 
  ** romania ** romania is a wonderful country , it 's a pity that it 's inhabitated , though . 
  hungarians want to annex the whole transylvania and enslave the romanians ( who are like 75 % of the population ) autonomy = independence = war a.i. 
  cuza should have never freed the gypsies ( they were slaves till 1856 ) ceausescu was fine but his wife was a bitc * northern europeans are perfect and are superior in every aspect to southern and eastern people . 
  in fact , if we replace our politicians with the swedish ones , we 'll become sweden the nazis were kinda right to kill gypsies because duh , gypsies and also jews because they were controlling the world russia sucks but should n't be bothered because they could wipe out half of europe serbia and the black sea are our only good neighbours ( moldova is romania so we 're not counting it ) all moldovans want to unite with romania but are being brainwashed by their russian politicians we should have never let the transylvanian saxons leave , we miss them so much , sigh . 
  the eu is kinda good but is taking too much of `` muh liberty '' all romanian politicians are corrupt scum and we would do better without them ( well , except klaus johannis , because he 's a saxon , duh ), 
   bunch of uneducated beggars . 
  yeah , obviously a bunch of uneducated beggars built [ this ] ( http://www.artactmagazine.ro/admin/data/file/20090709/muzeul_national_de_istorie_b.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://www.filarmonicaenescu.ro/img/cladire/cladire2.jpg ) , [ that ] ( http://www.romanianmonasteries.org/rom/images/castelul-peles-sinaia4.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://cdn-2.ideeviaggi.it/o/orig/romania-cosa-vedere_942be2d5f7410434950d0f94f0270ce3.jpg ) , [ that ] ( http://www.cipriandumitrescu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ciprian-dumitrescu-centrul-vechi.jpg ) , [ that ] ( http://www.romania-central.com/wp-content/uploads/pictures/cities-from-romania/bucharest/triumphal-arc-arcul-de-triumf-in-bucharest-images-01.jpg ) , [ that ] ( http://www.projects.aegee.org/suct/su2013/images/sus/ias1_5_iasi_2012.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-egqi67ot5gk/txo4dphzo_i/aaaaaaaakcm/tq9zyvrn3by/s1600/centrul-vechi-cladirea-cec.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://blog.imobiliare.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cec-bucuresti.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/craiova_-_prefectura_judetului_dolj02.jpg ) and [ that ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/constan%c5%a3a_-_cazino.jpg ) . 
   romania is barely functioning as a country what do you mean ? 
  we 're energetically , agriculturally , industrially ( maybe not so much ) and even economically stable and autonomous . 
  hell , we 're one of the few countries in the eu that does n't import all its energy . 
  our democracy right now might have flaws but it 's functioning , even better than the ones of '' more civilised '' countries like italy ( lots of italian politicians are practically the mafia 's puppets ) . 
   these parasites started flooding in as soon as romania got into the eu . 
  is it 100 % our problem ?? 
  did we ask them to come to romania during the middle ages ? 
  did we ask them to go to sweden ? 
  are n't we giving them tons of oppotunities regarding education ( free for them even after university-level education ) , healthcare ( free ) , job opportunities , social welfare ? 
  what should we do ? 
  put them in concentration camps ? 
  sterilize them ? 
  send them to madagascar ? 
  please , stop acting as we 're doing all this on porpouse . 
   name three major exports from romania , hungary or bulgaria . 
  i 'll speak for romania : 1 ) motor vehicles ( dacia is a romanian brand ) 2 ) it parts , computers and stuff ( we also have world 's second fastest internet speed ) 3 ) military equipment ( around 5 % of the world total ),
