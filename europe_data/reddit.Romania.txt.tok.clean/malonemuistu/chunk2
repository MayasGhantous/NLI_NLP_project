  man , for the last 10 years romania has done huge things about its corruption . 
  go to moldova , that 's how we were at the end of the 90 ' , and it sucked . 
  it 's true , we still have a lot of things to do about it but it 's getting better every day ; just to give you an example , the dna ( anti-corruption agency ) has put in prison an ex pm of romania of which everyone thought that he was `` untouchable '' , also 25 % of the county presidents are being investigated , and a lot of politicians , sport managers ( something like 8 managers out of 10 in the top football teams ) and bussinessmen . 
  romania is currently dealing very well with its corruption and in a matter of years we 'll probably get to the level of central europe . 
  well , actually they are not so `` in your face '' like they are in paris or london , because they are actually afraid by the police and do n't act like jackasses ( mont martre in paris is very frightening , you have the feeling that they are going to jump on you and steal everything within seconds but the police do n't seem to care at all ) . 
  the problem is not the old ladies , it 's the whole system behind them : the priests with bmws , the priests that take a lot of money both from the state and from the churchgoers , the belief that every single one of the 20 milion romanians is a devout orthodox and needs a church , all the forests and lands owned by the church , the historical nuildings owned by the church that are falling apart 'cause they are not orthodox and they could n't care less of . . i could go on for days , the problem is not the fate , it 's the church that ( at least at its top-levels ) is rotten and often wants to act as the state . 
  well , also in romania the law is pretty permissive ; the thing is , especially in rural places , the police do n't give a shit , if they find someone pickpocketing or stealing , first they beat them up , say they `` fell while entering the police stantion '' or something and then press useless charges and stuff . 
  it might not be the most human solution , it might not be the most legal one , but it usually works ... 
  not everything , they might have destroyed a lot but i still consider romania fancy . 
  for example , the city centre in bucharest , sibiu , brasov , iasi , and many other cities still kick ass . 
  i invite / u/redpossum to reconsider his stereotypes and prejudices and get his head out of his ass . 
  just look at some pre-communist buildings from bucharest and tell me they are n't `` fancy '' : [ ex .1 ] ( http://www.artactmagazine.ro/admin/data/file/20090709/muzeul_national_de_istorie_b.jpg ) , [ e. 2 ] ( http://www.filarmonicaenescu.ro/img/cladire/cladire2.jpg ) , [ ex .3 ] ( http://blog-it.hostelbookers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/architettura-bucarest.jpg ) , [ ex .4 ] ( http://cdn-2.ideeviaggi.it/o/orig/romania-cosa-vedere_942be2d5f7410434950d0f94f0270ce3.jpg ) , [ ex .5 ] ( http://www.cipriandumitrescu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ciprian-dumitrescu-centrul-vechi.jpg ) , [ ex .6 ] ( http://www.romania-central.com/wp-content/uploads/pictures/cities-from-romania/bucharest/triumphal-arc-arcul-de-triumf-in-bucharest-images-01.jpg ) , [ ex .7 ] ( http://jurnalspiritual.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/centrul-vechi-1.jpg ) , [ ex .8 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-egqi67ot5gk/txo4dphzo_i/aaaaaaaakcm/tq9zyvrn3by/s1600/centrul-vechi-cladirea-cec.jpg ) , [ ex .9 ] ( http://blog.imobiliare.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cec-bucuresti.jpg ) . 
  and as a bonus , [ constanta ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/constan%c5%a3a_-_cazino.jpg ) . 
  he got an injury yesterday , i think , i do n't know if he 'll play the whole match . 
  ah ok , thanks , i feared it meant this but i did n't want to reply immediatly and make a gaffe . 
  well , while agreeing with you that they are n't necessarily worthy of respect , i would n't shoot any of them . 
  in my opinion , in order for a democracy to function properly , all the different opinions should be listened to and considered , no matter how extreme they are , thus helping create a better state . 
  i for example , support my party ( an alde-aligned one ) a lot but i would n't ever want for it to take 50 % + of the seats in parliment , because it would mean that the party would be more inclined to become corrupt and eventually failing ; so , i want for other parties to get seats too , even the extremists , because this way the politicians from different parties would be controlling eachother , making corruption an oligarchies less likely . 
  yeah , i know , i just do n't understand what he meant by writing it ... 
   like hitler sadly , for her supporters she probably sounds like julius caesar or napoleon , they all fulfill that description ... 
  sorry , i honestly just do n't understand why you replied with `` m8 '' ; what do you mean by `` m8 '' ? 
  i think it 's one of the american-born lame running jokes of reddit ( french people stink/talk funny/are a bunch of pussies/don ' t love freedom/always surrender/etc . ) . 
  do n't take it personally , i do n't think anybody around here actually hates france , in fact in romania you 're seen in a very good light , we 're a part of `` la francophonie '' and we see you as cousins that helped building pre-communist romania and taught us how to be fancy . 
  i actually respect her . 
  she seems extremly cunning and smart ; although she 's some sort of genious of evil , she 's a master of rhetoric and she twists journalists ' questions and her adversaries ' arguments in her favor , making holding a debate with her a very difficult job to accomplish . 
  farage , on the other hand , looks and acts like the average far-right dude you 'd see pissing in front of a pub . 
  san marino , too insignificant for anybody to notice . 
  italians could just say there was a lake there all along , 
  no , do n't worry , no matter what the west will say about us , we 'll always see the british as gentlemen and the french as cousins . 
  i was gon na reply that there 's also romania in the latin-masterrace group but you preceded me . 
  anyway , we did pretty ok : psd ( left ) have won about 40 % of the seats , followed by two center-right parties at about 15 % and 11 % and the hungarians ' union at 7 % . 
  the only somehow eurosceptic party won 4 % . 
  the problem is , though , that this results might mirror the following presidential election 's , meaning that the left will have both a president and something like 48 % of the parliment , which is n't so good for democracy ( romania 's a semi-presidential republic , like france ) . 
   behave civil , not piss in the corners , steal , beg and all other things they are up to . 
  my brother visited much of the nordic countries and said that , while oslo and stockholm were great , helsinki was the most boring , grey , communist-feeling city he had ever seen . 
  oh , and there were drunk people pissing everywhere , all heil finnish manners !, 
  it 's especially true for the south of romania . 
  in constanta it feels like every other car has bulgarian plates . 
  i find it to be the contrary ... 
  there 's no `` fixed '' living standard . 
  for example , a s * ithole in romania might have a higher living standard than a poor part of southern italy . 
  on the other hand , milan has a higher living standard than any of romania . 
  bucharest , though , may be richer than , say , manchester . 
  there are too many differences between regions of the same country to say `` but the uk is super-rich and civilised and bulgaria is so poor '' . 
  sure , there 's plenty of work to do but give us poorer countries another decade or two and we 'll surely catch up . 
  it has already happened in many places : if you go to sibiu or sighisoara in romania you could think you 're in some bavarian village . 
  if you visit budapest , warsaw or prague you wo n't be able to spot many differences between them and western europe . 
  also , i think that the division between east and west is n't really a thing : portugal is very western geographycally but is n't a lot richer than hungary or poland . 
  yes , hopefully the recession will end soon and the southern and eastern eu countries will stop ranting about how evil germany controls them and their families and northern and western countries will stop the `` we 're being colonised and lazy people suck our money from us '' circlejerk . 
  the thing is that the eu has been beneficial for every country involved . 
  sure , in order to recive something you have to give something else back . 
  in my opinion , though , even if most people ca n't see it or take it for granted , the eu has become a very important part of our lives . 
  what would the students do without them awesome eu aids and erasmus . 
  what would people living at borders do without the freedom of movement ? 
  what would farmers do without the dop ( protected origin of products ) ? 
  what would anybody do without the unified market ? 
  what would countries do without the economical parachite that the euro is ? 
  the eu does n't need to be a usa wannabe , we can have both our national identities , cultures and traditions and the advantages of the eu . 
  your username translates to `` all gypsies are garbage '' ... 
  i do n't know why but i do n't kinda trust you . 
  eco did that on porpouse . 
  he said that he wrote the first 100 pages as a test , if one could read them , then he deserved to continue the read , if not , he did n't . 
  the heavy feeling of the first part helps to select the read.ers, 
  ** italy ** any novel by italo calvino , that guy was a genius !, 
  he wrote novels for almost every genra you could imagine and always nailed them . 
  a good start would be `` marcovaldo '' , a small collection of stories about a poor factory worker who , living in a big city , tries to make contact with nature and escape from his monotone life , always failing . 
  alternatively , you could read `` the name of the rose '' by umberto eco , maybe the best italian novel of the last century . 
  it talks about a crime in a monastery but it touches every topic possible : from religion to politics , from law to art and from love to gardening . 
  ** romania ** i personally liked `` romanul adolescentului miop '' by mircea eliade but sadly i have n't read too much of romanian literature ( i really want to though , surely this summer ) . 
  anyway , the novel talks about the teen life of the writer and his internal struggles . 
  i 'm all for an european federation but please , no bullsh * t like an only language ~ ~ and no religions ~ ~ or a ban on religions . 
  in fact the motto of the eu is `` in varietate concordia '' , united in diversity , having english or latin as the only language would only destroy what i love about europe . 
  i love to read dante in italian , garcia lorca in spanish , eminescu in romanian and rimbaud in french . 
  an only language would erase centuries of history and culture , which i think are the best two things about europe . 
  i do n't care if we do n't produce as many plastic things as china , or if we do n't have as much oil as russia , or if we ca n't be as technologically advanced as japan . 
  sure it would be nice , but i would always chose goethe over cheap plastic bottle caps . 
  my dream europe would be a federation of states ( pretty much like the actual states ) that would have their own languages , dialects , religions and traditions . 
  there would be no actual borders and big economical differences ( same salaries , same taxes ) . 
  the languages of the federal government would be english , german and french but as i already stated , every state of the federation would have its own official languages ( and regional languages too , for example hungarian would be the official language for the szeckler land alongside romanian but not for romania as a whole ) . 
  economics , foreign policies , defence and transport would be unified policies but education , ecology and others would change from state to state . 
  the thing is that you seem very nationalistic and i , personally , do n't like your tones . 
  charles and a bunch of other english rich noble people bought and restaured some historical buildings in transylvania , so the popular opinion towards them is pretty high . 
  also , we love top gear . 
  well , you were kinda viewed as pedos till romania entered the eu , so there might be this ... 
  the guy on the left not so much but the girl and the guy on the right are the walking stereotype of the gypsies that went to italy or spain and got out of the poverty stealing/doing shitty jobs . 
  i 've noticed that too . 
  also you can see their father ( ? ), 
  in the back and he does n't look gypsy at all . 
  the kids are definetly a mix although they are extremly poor . 
  you omitted the most gypsy of them , the two guys with the girl in the middle and the fat guy with the red jacket and sunflower seeds on his lips . 
  gypsies look a lot darker and are generally poorer , also they like to have the `` bad boy '' look ... imagine some mafia piciotto from sicily with indian features . 
  for example , the guys with the girl in the middle are gypsies , also the old woman with the statue and the man and woman with bad teeth ; the poor children , though , look pretty romanian but might be a mix ; the fat guy with the sunflower seed on his lips may be a mix between gypsy , romanian and slavic . 
  why blame the eu ? 
  it 's only the fault of our corrupt politicians that now are starting to go to jail . 
  well , that 's not their job at all , they are only expected to publish data that can be calculated rigorously . 
  i mean , how are they gon na estimate how much a highway buit in latvia benefited portugal and vice versa . 
  it 's just nuts to think that you could measure something like that and , being subjective , it 's not an institution 's job , it 's maybe a magazine or tv channel 's job, 
  and how many people in the '60 thought there was about to be a war and nothing happened ? 
  yeah, 
  every freaking euro they spend is reported and controlled .
