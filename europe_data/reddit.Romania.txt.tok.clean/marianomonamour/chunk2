  pretty bad ass from both of them . 
  americans and brits save some some french people ... again, 
   the whole idea of deterrent is a logical fallacy . 
  do n't bring logic into this because in your next sentence you pose `` being caught '' as a deterrent . 
   people would n't commit crimes if they thought they would be caught . 
  lol . 
  exhibit 1 : breivik . 
  he carefully planned his life after being caught , as a beacon for his ideology . 
  criminals do n't care about being caught but they do care about what happens after that . 
  in norway , you get to murder 77 and then live for free and become a student at a university . 
  it was a little too good to be true but i hoped anyway, 
  that 's a stupid question . 
  punishment is meant just as much to correct behaviour as it is to deter others from doing the same thing . 
  question is , will the cosy life he got into after 77 murders deter anyone from trying to top this record ? 
  i think not . 
  he gets shelter , food & education for life , all paid by the relatives of those he murdered . 
  is this a joke or norwegian justice in action ? 
  i ca n't tell the difference . 
  [ we should form a club ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure ) or maybe you want to buy this debt from us ? 
  we offer a very good price !, 
   the romanian treasure is a collection of valuable objects and the gold reserves ( ~ 120 tonnes ) of the romanian government sent to russia for safekeeping during world war i. 
  only part of the objects , and none of the gold reserves have been returned as of 2015 . 
  same shit in basarabia . 
  [ massive deportations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) and general brain washing of those left into believing they are not romanians . 
  they also brought in a lot of russians to help with russification and to serve as a later cover for military threats of needing to protect them . 
   i 'd say the only really bad thing russia did was to built a socialist satellite country from parts of germany . 
  you should make a red t-shirt with these words in white and wear it while backpacking through eastern europe, 
  bo $ $ ... do n't piss the tall trees if you ca n't run with the big dogs : https://youtu.be/rc6sz1jjing, 
  now all you need is a nuke to test it, 
  too bad there 's no way to see it from romania . 
  [ we 'll have to wait until they make it available for us ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120605033637-cronkite-all-laughing-horizontal-gallery.jpg ) . 
   whole region god himself is taking notes . 
  thank you for keeping us enlightened [ transylvanian guy ] ( http://memecrunch.com/meme/8acvw/dacii/image.jpg ) , thank you !, 
   not to mention that the japanese thought , they were as safe from tsunamis as germany is this comparison is aberrant . 
  fukushima was prepared for a 10 m high tsunami but it was struck by a 13-15 m one . 
   just a small reminder that this technology is not 100 % safe this is fud . 
  life comes with the strongest guarantee you will die . 
  can you risk living in these conditions ? 
  nothing is 100 % safe . 
  japan can calculate if the risk for the 15 m high tsunami was properly handled or not and if it was properly handled they did nothing wrong , they just did everything that was reasonable , which is ok . 
  the statistical fact is , nuclear power is much safer for both people living near plants and the planet as a whole while being plentiful enough to satisfy the energy needs of not just the richest countries who can afford expensive renewable energy which requires proprietary high tech technology and rare minerals . 
  nuclear power is the only option to keep the planet healthy and yet provide the other half of humanity with anything close to the energy consumed per capita in europe / us . 
   it was a perfectly valid reaction to what had happened no . 
  it was a political decision that has nothing to do with science and everything to do with pleasing the animal fears of decadent people living in a fantasy world where everything must be 100 % safe or it 's not worth the risk on their meaningless existence . 
  | do you feel like these 2 numbers are in any way comparable ? 
  easily : 73.8 billion = 184.5 x 0.4 billion, 
  hmmm . 
  seems prague needs more liberation tanks comrade !, 
  this is really nice . 
  i enjoyed it . 
  never been to bulgaria even though i lived all my life in southern romania . 
  for 25 + years all i heard is that it 's a risky , communist-grey place to be in . 
  i 'm glad when i get any boost for the hope that our neighbors are getting better . 
  i particularily liked how methodical they were . 
  300,000 were analyzed and 8,000 were deemed worthy of in depth investigation . 
  these 300 are just batch 1 . 
  i guess someone at anaf noticed the hail of news that the justice system works and they finally had the genius idea `` hey heeeey heeeeeeeeeey we can do something like that '' . 
  let 's hope we never need to use it and if we do , that it has some tricks up its sleeves 'cause officially , it ca n't do shit against a wave of mirvs or short range iskanders, 
  correct, 
  90 % is hyperoptimistic for rural areas, 
  icelandickish, 
  same fucking place . 
  take a walk after 22:00 through colentina , pantelimon , rahova or near gara de nord and you 're bound to see some shit go down . 
  one night i got up to have a glass of water and as i was looking down in the street , i was stunned to see a guy just mumbling something and walking angrily with a huge knife in his hand right on the tram line that passes through the middle of colentina street , near obor . 
  this is just an example , i 've even been in a situation where some punk threatened me with a knife , also in bucharest . 
  a lot of people here walk around with knifes on them . 
  they do n't use them much but my point was that it 's not at all uncommon for the police to encounter such an individual . 
  edit : it 's not just bucharest , you 'll encounter certain types of people carrying knifes all across the country , including in rural areas . 
  again , they do n't show it much but every once in a while one of them gets drunk and then you hear it in the news . 
  also , it 's not just romania , it 's very common in eastern europe for thuggish people to have knifes on them . 
  if you think an overly aggressive guy with a knife and something to throw at you is exceptionally rare , then you have n't lived much in eastern europe, 
   you are not a police or have the slightest idea about their work i can see from this comment you resort to personal attacks instead of arguments . 
  everybody needs the police , not just those people who `` know how police works '' and everybody knows the kind of results the police needs to produce . 
  when an extremely aggressive guy wields a knife and throws metallic objects at cops , i do n't want my police to `` shoot to scare '' and delay the time required to neutralize him , especially because the guy could 've easily ran into an hostage opportunity or even run away completely from those 2 wannabe cops . 
  am i professionally trained to shoot guns ? 
  these cops and their bosses should be fired immediately for incompetence . 
  they look like 2 random vigilante wannabes who were given badges , guns , a car and a bunch of how-to-be-a-cop leaflets and then sent out to patrol the streets . 
  * how can you be professionally qualified to shoot a gun and miss so many shots ? 
  * why are they jumping around like a bunch of stressed out cats ? 
  they 're supposed to be trained to handle this kind of situation , especially considering the bad guy did n't even had guns . 
  * why is the big dumb fuck leaving her alone to go to the car before the bad guy is cuffed ? 
  * why are they both afraid to cuff him ? 
  mediocre . 
  initially i thought those are some magical dogs but then i saw they did n't caught this through regular checks  it 's a four year hunt and successful cooperation between romanian , turkish and ukrainian authorities, 
  no , afaik feta is a distinct type of cheese coming from greece, 
  i think the translation is not quite right for romanian . 
  '' [ branza ] ( http://www.agromonitor.ro/media/branza-sibiu-oi-sibiu.jpg ) '' is not the same with what the western world expects for [ cheese ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_608/foods/c/cheese_16x9.jpg ) . 
  cheese is usually understood to be a refined milk-derived product whose closest romanian equivalent is '' [ cascaval ] ( https://aphextwinz.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/slide138.jpg ) '' . 
  branza is one of the simplest types of milk based products that , afaik , is almost unheard of in the west even though it 's delicious and by far no 1 in popularity in ro . 
  what do you think seat & skoda are ? 
  by the time this austerity fad is over , you 'll all be driving dacias .

  we 're talking about top of the line hardware . 
  this is not what their exports is based on . 
  i 'm aware . 
  i meant more than just that . 
  hungary could be our strategic link with western europe in case of war with russia but we could certainly not count on hungary as an ally even though we 're in nato together . 
  too much lack of liberal democracy , too much political friendship and too many economical ties with russia ensure we ca n't rely on hungary as a strategic ally . 
  serbia is also out . 
  poland via ukraine is the only link left and it 's a long detour .
