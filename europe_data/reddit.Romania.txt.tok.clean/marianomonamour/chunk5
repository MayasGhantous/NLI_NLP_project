  greece gets the cheapest imaginable radical reform simply because it has powerful friends , which should keep everyone wanting for that magic yurop fairy dust , and the humiliation greece will endure will not leave anyone else wanting to be bailed out like that . 
  i 'm quite sure that if eu sees reforms strongly taking hold over the next 10-15 years , greece will get some major debt cuts and will put this whole thing behind it in just one generation . 
  that 's a very happy ending out of the shit they 're currently in . 
  did you check your shoes before leaving ?!, 
  if you took any soil with you in greece then no wonder it all went to hell there ... you know how strong the curse is , 
  we 'll see if syriza really wants to keep greece in eu/ez or not . 
  i do believe the matter will be clarified by sunday simply because greece 's economy ca n't take one more week with banks closed . 
   prices double every 15 hours damn . 
  queuing to buy something must 've felt like nyse floor trading . 
  people looking up at argentina are so tiny they need to get on a stool to wipe the floor, 
  at the very least you can bring this up every time any greek ever talks shit about bulgaria, 
  right after moldova, 
   bulgaria , the european union 's poorest nation with half the monthly wage of neighboring greece , is ready to provide humanitarian aid even if it means cutting social spending at home , prime minister boyko borissov said . 
   `` in case the greeks need help , we 'll always support them '' by providing food and medicine , borissov said in a phone interview in sofia late wednesday . 
  `` that money could be used for '' domestic `` social policy or for education instead , but we 'll still do it . '' i have a feeling bulgaria will soon have to give up its prized first place on the bottom of various eu ratings, 
  i assume they got the shitty room because all the others were occupied by more important meetings, 
  so you 're telling me he could solve this whole thing just by setting up a greek lemonade stand in brussels ? 
  [ wrong ] ( https://ablogaboutideas.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/castle_neuschwanstein.jpg ) inb4 : i said * you * ca n't build ... 
   cemented their power for at least a decade or more so how many days without money you think greece can handle before syriza is skinned alive ? 
  yeah . 
  i would shit [ bonos ] ( https://atoast2toast.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/bono_in_africa.jpg ) if i were greece on sunday and on my 3rd excuse that the dog ate my homework . 
  dude , you need to demand the money and threaten that you 'll kill yourself if you do n't get it, 
  [ we even made a browser addon for that :d ] ( http://www.bucharestnotbudapest.com/news ), 
  not even rt tried to manipulate as blatantly as op did, 
  getting greece to fall in line is a much smaller problem that those . 
  if we ca n't solve greece we do n't really need to worry about the others . 
  you want to remember about the ukrainians that die every day fighting the russians ? 
  or about the 200 + european citizens on mh17 murdered by the russians with no consequence ? 
  or about the us/uk performing state-backed economic espionage on fr/de ? 
  / thread, 
  i do n't want to make this about romania . 
  i 'm first to agree we 'll still have serious corruption for a long time and i also suspect there 's some essential stimulus from us to get our shit in order . 
  i also agree for us to be kept out of shengen , ez and under mcv for however many decades are necessary to become a decent eu member . 
  you 're underestimating how fast things are changing here and how deep the changes go . 
  academia and the medical services will be the last to feel the knife for good reasons but it has already started to happen even there in cases that were simply outrageous . 
  [ get used to it ] ( http://www.nineoclock.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kovesi.jpg ) . 
  also , the issue is corruption that burns other people 's money . 
  i could not give less of a shit about corruption in greece if it would n't be fueled by european money . 
  [ yeah , i 'm just about to start crying for the greeks ] ( http://nypost.com/2015/07/05/decades-of-fraud-have-swindled-greeks-out-of-billions/ ) * on the island of zakynthos , ~ 2 % of the population ( rate 9 times higher than elsewhere in europe ) was registered as blind and thus entitled to $ 400-a-month disability pensions and other charity perks . 
  among the 680 residents registered as blind in 2011 , some 500 were n't blind at all . 
  * a recent government investigation -- part of an anti-fraud crackdown mandated by the country 's creditors -- found a highly suspicious 8,500 pensioners had passed age 100 . 
  a closer look showed some 40,000 pensions were being `` collected '' by people who were no longer among the living . 
  * the subway system serving 5 million athenians was essentially a free ride . 
  athens ' subway has no turnstiles , and riders are expected to pay their fares on the honor system . 
  unfortunately for the city coffers , honor is in short supply . 
  * the honor system also falls short when it comes to greeks reporting their income for tax purposes . 
  in a country of 11 million people , only 5,000 admitted they earned more than $ 100,000 a year , the daily mail reported . 
  * a daily mail investigation focused on one of athens ' most exclusive neighborhoods , full of lawyers , doctors and masters of industry . 
  only 300 of the area 's homes claimed to have swimming pools , which require owners to pay a luxury tax . 
  but when officials looked into the low number , using google earth to scan the back yards , they found the number of pools to be closer to 20,000 . 
  the fraudsters responded by buying camouflage-print tarps to cover up their pools , the mail reported . 
  ** and on and on and on and on **, 
  it 's true . 
  i did n't know that . 
  thanks . 
  you , or some other mod , deleted this thread and with it what i spent an hour composing because you felt it belonged to a mega-thread that was started in the meantime . 
  this was wrong . 
  it 's unreasonable to waste my effort like that . 
  is there an obvious major reason why it 's not possible to remain in the eu ? 
  it 's an eu thing . 
  you ca n't understand it . 
  yes but * < insert-magic-brics-free-money-here  *, 
  i hope when they planned the eur printing mechanism they thought about when a state goes rogue and starts printing money because that 's definitely a path greece would take now . 
  from your answer it seems that if greece can only print 20 eur bills , then there 's enough time to close the borders and start replacing in the ez all eur bills printed in greece before they can inject too many new bills in circulation . 
  are you crazy ? 
  they voted and so they do n't have to worry about these things .

  look , less talk and more money . 
  ** send free money !, 
  ** they voted , you know . 
  allright brother !, 
  citizens in de , fr , nl and many other countries are each owed 650 + eur by greece . 
  how many debts do you want to buy and remember , that 's 650 + eur not considering that greece wants more money now !, 
  especially since they did their part and voted today so ** send more money now brother !, 
   we have kke for that that 's for later . 
  syriza is just the free samples to get you hooked . 
   maybe some people did but i do n't personally know anyone who did so . 
  as decades passed and we saw the disaster yielded by those who remained in power because ceausescu was killed and so their responsibility remained unrevealed , some regret settled in , not because that human garbage was dead but because we could n't also get rid of those around him . 
  there is also some regret for killing him on christmas day . 
  so it 's unlikely anyone has fond memories of his execution . 
  it was an extremely tensioned moment and it will forever remain in doubt if we really needed to have him killed so that all those around him knew it 's over or if there was a better way . 
  i fully support a response referendum in ez countries to determine if more of their money should go to greece on greece 's terms . 
  as far as eu is concerned , i would support keeping them in the eu on the drahma and handling their debt like any other country 's ( both haircuts and restructuring seem unavoidable ) . 
  what i 'm saying is that syriza is the path to communism . 
  communism is the most spectacular failure ever of an ideology in practice that destroyed the lives of hundreds of millions in the last century and continues to be a plague today . 
  because it 's a hallucination , in all its real-world forms communism requires population control . 
  what you have above are examples of what happened in romania . 
  what would happen in greece would be different but only in form , not in essence . 
  and on christmas day in 1989 , ceausescu , the dictator behind this decision , was executed swiftly in a country that is 90 % + christian and everybody cheered . 
  it was an historical mistake as this event allowed the ranks behind him to survive , remain unknown and close to power to this day , a position from which they undermined my country 's progress towards a functional democracy for their own benefit ( their grip is slipping but very slowly ) . 
  here is some of what happened in those 8 years : * food was rationed . 
  food required for a minimally normal diet was permanently missing from stores . 
  people had to endure long hours queued outside stores to even get a chance of getting their ratio of anything . 
  for your children to not fall ill from malnutrition you had to develop a personal network of acquaintances that could help you procure food from small farmers or store workers / managers , through bribes . 
  * central heating in large towns was just enough to not have ice developed on the inside of your windows . 
  in most towns there was no central heating and you had to rely on improvised heating solutions ( most of which relied on gas , which was also rationed ) .
