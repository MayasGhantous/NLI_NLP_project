  * electricity was rationed . 
  there was no electricity during the night or during most of the day . 
  * saturday was a slightly shorter work day but still a work day . 
  * healthcare was disastrous . 
  only very generic drugs were available and if you developed any special problem you were as good as dead as there were not nearly enough medical supplies for surgeries and whatever there was , was accessible only through large bribes or connections to someone from the party . 
  * party propaganda about the glorious path romania is walking on was omnipresent . 
  all media was continuously pumping fake news about huge production efficiency in all areas of agriculture and industry . 
  the assault on your mind was debilitating due to the omnipresence of these messages in all media and everything you did all day long , in contrast with the reality that you could see around you . 
  * terror was omnipresent , including within families , through the political police ( securitatea ) . 
  500.000 collaborators ( from a population of ~ 22.000.000 ) were feeding them with info about any person they saw doing or saying anything against the party , in exchange for favors like a little more food . 
  if you became a target for securitate , it was like torture because the party and the political police were above the law . 
  they could get you fired and you would not be hired anywhere else or they could make you disappear in some prison via arranged trials . 
  i do n't recommend greece take this path but with communists in power , they will get a flavor of what happened in romania . 
  it 's unavoidable . 
   if ** tsipras ** was in it , nobody would hire him . 
  he ** has n't worked a day in his life in the real economy **, 
  i 'm not too worried about the uk and i do n't think their referendum will be too dramatic , really . 
  they 're stuck between being a proxy for us in eu , being in a close orbit to the eu and deluding themselves that independent of these massive proximities they are still a global heavy weight . 
  so long as eu exists , any attempt to move out of their comfy current position will instantly feel like pulling live teeth without anesthesia . 
  uk is much more likely to try and shatter the eu or at least to slow down its political unification , than to pull out . 
  mmmm i 'm bathing in your [ charity money ] ( http://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/south-park/clip-thumbnails/season-4/0411/south-park-s04e11c12-ten-million-dollars-16x9.jpg ) , king nothing . 
  now you get to apply some of those northern high-horse advices you had for us on how to handle those gypsies . 
  we 're dying to learn . 
   marxism and modern communism get a bad reputation :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d :d my god !, 
  this is what communism ** is ** . 
  an unsustainable hallucination of a mythical new man that has no relationship to real human beings . 
  once the hallucination meets reality , tumors start to develop leading to what russian-backed communism was in europe . 
  as long as communists do n't get to power , theirs is one of the most seductive songs that were ever sang in young ears . 
  communism will ** always ** evolve into these horrors starting from the same best-intentions as it ever did . 
   modern communism jesus . 
  that 's like rooting for modern pedophilia . 
  wake the fuck up . 
  we knew we had it the worst . 
  especially the last 10 years up to '89 were at a whole other level . 
  intellectual resistance was crushed in waves all along but since ceausescu decided to repay all the foreign debt it was like living in the gulag . 
  no food in the stores , everything was rationed , no imports of any kind and no talking about the hardships . 
  securitatea ( the secret police ) had 500.000 collaborators and it often happened that family members turned each other in for incredibly frivolous privileges . 
  my family was targeted by securitate to become collaborators . 
  it was a horrible couple of years as they were more and more threatened to lose their jobs unless they play ball and i remember distinctly how afraid my parents were when i started going to school and they were trying to make the 7 year old me understand that if i ever tell anyone at school what i hear in the house , they will go to prison . 
  i just remember perfectly the profound fear they had when i was explained that . 
  i think you get it . 
  it takes a huge amount of your time to be a smart , informed , critical , active citizen . 
  without this effort that many do n't want to spend , democracy is just an illusion . 
  good luck next week !, 
   in hungary you could literally say bad stuff about the government and joke about it i know . 
  communism did n't manage to destroy down to the bone some of the countries behind the iron curtain . 
  beside hungary , ex-czechoslovakia and poland also got a lighter version of communism that allowed some intellectual resistance which greatly helped you during the transition to democracy / capitalism . 
  in romania , the communists manged to exterminate ( literally kill , in prisons and through forced labor ) all intellectual resistance and institute a state based on oppression and fear . 
  the worker drones were terrorized by the party and their close collaborators . 
  it was like 2 distinct classes , one which was above the law ( literally ) and made up of a small percent of the population and another which was terrorized to talk about some things even in the privacy of their own houses . 
  out of all the countries in europe , we were the closest to what north korea is today . 
  like most in it , you are insulated from the reality of the world around you and free to have ideological orgasms all day long . 
  if tsipras was in it , nobody would hire him . 
  he has n't worked a day in his life in the real economy and now he 's leading greece against a huge real economy problem even though he has no idea what he 's doing . 
  he 's a party activist hell bent on selling ideological illusions to the masses . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  p.s : v-man is an egomaniac that is playing poker with greece for the adrenaline rush . 
  he has dual citizenship and more than enough money to live happily regardless of the consequences of his actions . 
  i highly doubt anyone will see that money back . 
  this struggle is not about money it 's about politics and the huge consequences deriving from the way greece will be treated ( everyone else will demand the same treatment ) . 
   yes , and syriza presented a program to address that . 
  of course they wanted to go after rich people , which is why that was n't well-received despite all the rhetoric . 
  and this is how you 're played by these neo-communists . 
  `` we 're going after the rich ! '' . 
  this does n't do shit . 
  even the slightest improvement in general tax collection yields to the budget vastly more money than what can be easily taken only from rich people ( who need to be taxed extremely intelligently because they can easily afford to pay others to find loopholes and avoid tax collection ) . 
  of course improvement in general tax collection are generally not popular and that 's where syriza 's incompetence kicks in . 
   i am generally very away from politics , i rarely check the news and open my tv . 
  this is often the cumulative reason why a country degrades structurally . 
  people are too beaten down by life 's hardships or too ignorant to see they need to continuously monitor and question their leaders ( which is expensive as it takes time from everyone 's life ) and then an unwritten contract comes into effect : the leaders turn a blind eye from some illegal things people do or they make sure the people get something they have n't earned , and the people do n't comment too much about the things their leaders do . 
  mcdonald 's ? 
   in romania they even serve beer . 
  [ secret santa money ... hmm ] ( http://denisuca.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/thinking-meme-640x523.png ), 
  and that is the tragedy . 
  youth paying for their fathers ' sins . 
  do n't become drunk with this madness though . 
  it happens everywhere . 
  i felt the exact same rage for the 2 generations of romanians that let themselves become brain-dead worker drones under communism which led to a disastrously slow transitions to capitalism that stole the future of one more generation and led to a mass exodus of ~ 3 million romanians towards the west . 
  if you go west , do n't ever let anyone make you feel guilty for it . 
  you owe nothing . 
  economy crashes . 
  deaths from natural causes will rise sharply . 
  you choose no = `` i 'll pay my debts on my own terms if ever '' and that will mean you choose to give the young people a chance by crashing the economy and letting most of the older people die . 
  it will happen fast and spectacularly ( as in not enough room in morgues to handle all the dead ) . 
  i do n't think a country capable of such mind blowing choices would be so dysfunctional as yours is . 
  the greeks are very proud people so they may have problems accepting money from each other . 
  they tolerate well money from other ez citizens . 
  | she said she 's speaking out `` because we greeks are a proud people ... 
  if i 've learned something these days is just how immensely proud greeks are . 
  i really ca n't imagine how they 'll get by with all that pride without the other ez citizens giving them more of their money for nothing . 
  [ mmmmmm ] ( http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/components/photo/_new/120305-putin-tears-1a.jpg ) ca n't hold back these red hot feelings commarade, 
  so when proud people ca n't repay their loans , instead of taking their house , the bank loans them more money to get an education , health insurance , a house and a job so that they can repay the bank . 
  right ? 
  spending 2 % on defense is a very weak criteria to assess how healthy europe 's ability to defend itself is . 
  your outrage at 70 % of europe 's defense spending coming from just 4 countries is silly since those 4 produce [ 64 % of the total gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ) . 
  regardless , spending 2 % on defense is the minimum each country should do and is directly responsible for . 
  monstrous redundancies between equipment owned/built by each country , the different priorities each country has and the guaranteed lack of political coordination when 28 countries need to react quickly are much much bigger problems than that 2 % . 
  another big problem is why , in 2012 , all european members were accounting for [ 21 % of nato 's spending ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21551491 ) while us was somewhere at 70 % . 
  that is a very ugly problem . 
  this can only happen after europe becomes a [ con ] federation , which will take more than 50 years from now and is conditioned by us remaining the king of the hill in the meantime .
