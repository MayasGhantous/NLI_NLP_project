`` historically differently abled '' ftfy , you ableist . 
  the mountainous geography of the area makes quite easy for us down here to use wind and hydro energy . 
  i 'd congratulate finland and the baltics . 
  funny that these two articles are on the frontpage of the sub : 1 . 
  [ gazprom gas deliveries to romania fall 13 pct ] ( http://af.reuters.com/article/energyoilnews/idafl6n0rx1pn20141002 ) 2 . 
  [ romanian officials search lukoil 's offices ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/02/lukoil-romania-search-idukl6n0rx41720141002 ) i 'm not even mad . 
  yes , get rekt chad !, 
  from [ here ] ( http://www.chemspider.com/chemical-structure.10194104.html ) we can take the density of ( pure ) cocaine to be \u03c1 = 1.2 g/cm ^ 3 given a mass m = 600 kg ( 600.000 g ) we can put that in the density formula \u03c1 = m/v and find that this amount of cocaine has a volume v = 500.000 cm ^ 3 ( 1.2 = 600.000 / v ) if we abstract a `` line '' as a [ cuboid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuboid ) with the width and height of 0.5 cm we can calculate the length needed to make it have that volume :  0.5 cm * 0.5 cm * x cm = 500.000 cm ^ 3 and x ( length ) , turns out to be 2.000.000 cm , or 2.000 km . 
  the moon is at an average of ~ 380.000 km away , so no moon for you , but you could go one-way from london to sofia or from london to marseille and back . 
  i blame the doctor . 
  why ? 
  irish , as a celtic language , is indo-european . 
  no i do n't ... 
  but i still would n't dare him . 
  yeah , easy to say from a continent and an ocean away . 
  yeah ... 
  i have a feeling that one month after the ellections , they ' `` surprisingly '' announce they ca n't actually do it , because yurp . 
  for the curious : [ geoguessr ] ( https://geoguessr.com/ ) . 
  most addictive game ever . 
  sure , as soon as we redo geography . 
  by default , i never trust anything without an author , however the guy/gal who misspelled the counties on the map to bucau , gorg and dorj really made my day . 
  i wish we could keep these names . 
  i was expecting it from cz , hu ; i guess that 's the benefit of having another country between you and an active battle , but i have to admit i 'm a bit surprised by slovakia 's stance . 
  the last time i was in bucharest for a concert ( 2012 iirc ) , a taxi drove me on st.c.mare at about 16:30 . 
  i was never more afraid for my life . 
  thisishowidie.jpg edit : and to add to the topic , outside of bucharest , i usually had good experiences in most cities of 100k + ( except the crowding ) . 
  you usually get a city owned trolley/bus/tram network which is adequate in most cases , and private mini-busses/maxi-taxis which serve more finely-tuned locations . 
  you do n't disrespect palinka , palinka disrepects you !, 
  is n't that as it always was and will be ? 
  i 'm actually surprised there is something distinctive enough to guess i 'm romanian without hearing me speak . 
  i 'm going to guess it may have something to do with my interchangable use of past perfect and past perfect progressive ( `` had lived '' / `` had been living '' ) . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect :  1 .

  greek, 
  this is significant for that particular area , but please note that there are about 60 more individuals in the country in [ three more camps ] ( http://www.bisonbonasus.ro/zimbrul-in-romania/ ) ( ro limk , the animal = zimbru in romanian ) . 
  they were gone for ~ 3 centuries ; iirc , the last wild one died in the first 1/4 of the 18th century . 
  most of the ones living today are brought in from the uk , czech rep and/or slovakia , and poland . 
  inb4 talks about what is what is not balkan . 
  but , i never heard the tiger thing . 
  i heard of the bear , eagle or lion , but no tiger . 
  is it a thing ? 
  good news !, 
  ^ i ^ had ^ to ^ do ^ it, 
  no , he said we would n't recognize a self-made referendum by the minority , not one made-by or approved-by kiev regarding the minority . 
  bulgaria ... [ darn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw8dnstf3te ) . 
  my favourite spices are kamis . 
  never knew they are polish . 
  edit : oh , and the hungarian kotanyi . 
  give it a few years . 
  i 'm guessing that this is done by counting purchases and not by polling . 
  the thing is that spirits are often times considered a `` prestige '' drink to buy and often bought because of this ( or because of low volume & low price needed for inebriation ) , beer is cheap ( usually cheaper than a cup of coffee ) and pretty much everyone has a relative in the countryside making homebrewed wine and as such , not buying as much . 
  i 'd put us more in the middle than leaning towards spirits . 
  this is , of course , just personal opinion , and i 'm not extremely familiar with our neighbors , but i 'll take a guess and say that it 's similar in bulgaria and moldova . 
  that sums up my eu4 p-l commonwealth campaigns . 
  make the hungarian one and put it next to the romanian one . 
  do n't worry , it 's election year . 
  everyone and their mom will try and push reforms and pump cash in infrastructure a few months before the votes . 
  i 'd worry about 2015 . 
  in all fairness , no matter what they/us did , they/we we would n't be accepted . 
  and now you know why ... 
  same here . 
  surprisingly correct , but i 'll politely decline , if that 's ok .  for anyone interested , it means `` suck dick '' and the pronunciation is [ sugi pula ] = [ su\u02a4 ^ j pu ` l\u0251 ] . 
  edit : deleted comment was a lithuanian guy testing his skills . 
  probably went to the local men school . 
  `` pula '' = penis in vulgar speech . 
  though i suspect estonians pronounce it with a long o , rather than a short u. 
  nevertheless we get a laugh every summer when croatian tourism offers appear and invite us to the great city of [ pula ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pula ) . 
  so is swedish in finland , french in belgium , irish in ireland , welsh in the uk and more . 
  `` mother tongue '' does not necessarily mean the language most used . 
  and in all fairness , this map does n't measure that . 
  it measures what most of a minority of people are using . 
  the fact that belorussians are using b.rus or rus . 
  is irrelevant ( them being a majority ) ; the fact that minorities use russian is . 
  let me get this straight ... we 're not allowed into schengen over concerns on border security ( french foreign affairs m. [ said ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/30/us-france-roms-idusbre98t08120130930 ) `` due to concerns about border security '' , 26 . sept. 2013 ) , yet they will allow our biggest non-schengen border ( except for serbia who can go through croatia , and bulgaria which is already in the eu ) to be visa-free ? 
  stuff 's fishy . 
  atlantic -  mediterranean -  black sea -  flooding in the plains along the danube . 
  and wallonia afaik . 
  the hell is this ? 
  this should be removed . 
  brilliant !, 
  still waiting for an article on us , i 'm not ashamed to read . 
  * if * they 're very efficient and it would still take a few decades . 
  on the upper hand , vaslui wo n't ... nevermind , we 'll still make fun of vaslui . 
  does anyone know of any similar projects for other european cities ? 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.rkhomemaderecipes.com/beef-tripe-soup-ciorba-de-burta.html ) seems the most usual one . 
  you should explain that the bor ( the romanian orthodox church ) has a monopoly on church approved candles ( d'oh !, 
  ) , meaning you ca n't enter with outside candles in church or cemetery ( if you 're spotted ) . 
  and they usually sell hundreds every sunday or burial/baptism . 
  best part ? 
  they do n't pay any taxes for revenues made upon selling them . 
  oh , and icons !, 
  cheile bicazului , at the border of neam\u021b an harghita counties .

  lacu ro\u0219u is a lake where a side of a mountain slid and blocked the course of a river , so the lake still has trees poking out of it ( and if it 's a drought and the water level is low , you can see the church steeples poking out ) pics : [ 1 ] ( http://www.sandrinio.ro/media/2011/07/cu-barca-pe-lacu-rosu.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.andreibartesch.com/wp-content/gallery/lacul-rosu/lacul-rosu_02.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://gallery.agonia.net/data/media/10/lacul_rosu_1.jpg ) . 
  housing is dirt cheap in the area . 
  for future readers , he failed to mention that \u021a = ts ( ca * ts * ) and \u0103 = \u0259 as in the english article `` a/an '' .
