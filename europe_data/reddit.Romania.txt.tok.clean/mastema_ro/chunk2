  edit : it 's similar to palinka , but with more aroma and less alcohol content . 
   think of it as going to dublin or dehli and feeling sad as an englishman . 
  they are similar . 
  ours is less thick ( think n england v. s scotland ) . 
  people not native to either of the two have trouble recognizing them , but there are phonological differences there . 
  i myself am from the romanian part of moldova and sometimes have to explain twice that i 'm from * this * moldova . 
  in all fairness , the further east you go in m , the more russianised ( does this word even exist ? ), 
  the vocabulary is . 
  anecdote : i was about 10-11 ( roughly ' 94 - ' 95 ) and we were visited by two families of friends from the rep. of moldova : one from chisinau , one from tighina ( in transnistria ) . 
  with the kid from chisinau i had no problems talking to , bar the accent . 
  but the kid from tighina ... we mostly just understood each others ' verbs . 
  my nouns were too latin , his were too russian . 
  i know ... 
  i live here . 
   romani =| = roma ** nians ** we have no issue with the italian capital . 
  and that numa song `` dragostea din tei '' ( love from the linden tree ) is actually [ moldovan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/o-zone ) , sung in romanian . 
  people will downvote you if you say we 're not the greatest ever , or if you side with hungary , even if what you say is true historically . 
  i had no idea this existed ; gon na visit it next summer . 
  i was planning on visiting some sites in banat anyway . 
  that looks awfully familiar . 
   many sadly do n't understand certain aspects of humour , especially if it has self-deprecating comments it 's historical . 
  we always were between other powers/empires and often vassals of them [ ( austria - ) hungary , poland ( - lithuanian com . 
  we do a lot of those jokes ourselves , it just feels weird and looked-down-upon when someone else does it . 
   ceausescu , who led the party for the latter half of socialist reign , is universally despised . 
   ...  little nostalgia for the socialist days you 'd be surprised at how many people over 40-45 long for those days . 
  it 's mostly due to the fact that almost every business was state owned and when you finished a trade school or college ( who were also state owned ) you 'd be automatically given a job ( maybe at the other end of the country , but it 's still a job ) . 
  they all seem to forget everything else : water/heating/electricity cuts , no food in stores , no freedom of speech , political arrests ( my grandpa spent a year and a half in prison for failing to report a joke a colleague of his made about `` the beloved '' ) , etc. 
  believe it or not , people looked at you guys as the closest thing to the west . 
  i was only five in ' 89 , but i still remember how most people tuned their makeshift antennas towards sofia for movies and football matches ; no one understood a thing , but hey ! , at least you could see it . 
   that numa numa song ... is actually moldovan , but we share the language . 
  gon na be 3rd soon ; something 's being built in the uae again . 
  short as in `` lute '' and accented . 
  ipa would be / sa . 
  guys , there 's no need to downvote a response with facts : the census did have these numbers . 
  there is a question on their validity , but lenolaj 's argument still stands . 
  as an anecdote regarding the validity , i 'll mention my dad 's uncle born in reghin ( hun . 
  sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen ) who had to be registered upon birth with a hun . 
  first name ( clerk would n't accept the rom . 
  one ) ; he ended up changing it in his 20s when he moved to ia\u0219i for college . 
  there are also tales ( as in : i have n't bothered looking it up , so i can only vouch for the fact they exist , not for their validity ) of family names being changed especially for easy to translate names . . adjectives or occupations ( eg : albu , negru , mare into feher , fekete , nagy ) , but honestly , not sure if this actually happened . 
  [ balkan sprachbund ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sprachbund#morphology ) . 
  give the entire page a read , it 's quite interesting !, 
   romanians are bad , poor/having it worse than us this has to be a joke . 
  please tell me it 's a joke . 
  as an orthopedics nurse in a romanian hospital i get my fair share of gypsies with voluntarily chopped off limbs ( some of them self-inflicted ) for the sole purpose of begging better ( their words , not mine ) . 
  and then we have to spread already limited resources to them because it 's an emergency hospital and they pay out of pocket . 
  you have to have some serious passion for begging to chop your own leg . 
  ps : notice i said gypsy and not roma ; for me it 's the same as the blacks/niggers routine chris rock had . 
  am i the only one curious about the two guys/gals in antarctica ? 
   about 400,000 people have already left , according to the official statistics . 
  lightweights !, 
  but seriously , welcome to the club . 
  that big thing to the east , with a big blue splotch on top of moscow is russia . 
  i may be wrong , but , from looking at a [ relief map ] ( http://www.freeworldmaps.net/printable/scandinavia/relief.jpg ) and a physical one ( i hear google has one ) , which , honestly you could have done as well : a ) the scandinavian mountains b ) rivers and valleys c ) lakes ( kallsj\u00f6n , storsj\u00f6n ) , fjords ( trondheimsfjord ) , rivers and the mountains being thinner e-w there . 
  people like water . 
  edit : thanks to kmatika for spotting a typo . 
  service quality has nothing to do with this . 
  they only have some 20 people/km ^ 2 . 
  such a moronic thing to say !, 
  you guys already had [ this guy ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jan/13/piracy-student-loses-us-extradition ) extradited to the us for trial ; trial as in `` not found guilty yet by us laws '' . 
  just give it a few more successful lobbies , that will be fun for all of us with extradition treaties . 
  edit : looks like they reached an agreement and he was n't extradited . 
  still , a judge did decide to send him packing in the first place . 
  this needs to be polandballed . 
  also , yay us !, 
  for almost starting ww3 . 
  romania would bring snacks and booze , always mentioning how much better his are compared to istv\u00e1n 's . 
  he 'd get drunk a couple of hours in and start telling stories and taking credit for something his grandad did . 
  all sweaty from dancing , he 'd try to drunkenly chat up \u00c9milie and not understand why john and hans are giving him the stink eye ( he 'll brag about `` hittin ' dat '' to his friends in a few days , though ) . 
  by the end of the night , he 'll probably end up doing shots in the kitchen with zhivko and goran pretending they 're stronk . 
  edit : damn , beaten to it . 
  i was hoping my tongue-in-cheek comment about getting food was a good indication i 'm actually making fun . 
  what to do when your water gets cut off or is not running . 
  * buy bottled water * go fill cans and bottles at a friend 's or neighbor 's place * use a water pump * use or dig a well * collect rainwater in barrels * fill containers from streams , rivers , lakes * eat water-rich foods such as cucumbers or tomatoes please note that having the water cut off does not mean they fly you to the middle of the desert and let you die . 
  also remember , in the eventuality your gas wo n't be working at some point and you get hungry , they have these places where they make food for you and they 'll trade it to you in exchange for bits of metal and paper . 
  ~ ~ only for 17 out of 27 countries . 
  did they run out of paper ? ~ ~ apparently i ca n't read . 
  disregard that . 
  seriously ? 
  we 're among the cheapest in the eu . 
  guess you ca n't beat s asia for price . 
  i spent 25 seconds making [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/indraex.jpg ), 
  although not directly related , [ this article ] ( http://www.zf.ro/analiza/top-20-al-celor-mai-mari-proprietari-de-bovine-din-romania-cel-mai-mare-are-3-086-de-vaci-7993198 ) from 2011 , shows a list of the largest 20 bovine owners , and with a few exceptions ( lebanon , israel ) they 're either romanian or from the eu . 
  unfortunately the list is an image , so translate wo n't help , but nationalities are easy to understand , i assume . 
  they mention an 8 % foreign ownership and mention the percentages owned by various nationalities : 24.29 % italians , 15.48 % germans , 9.98 % from various arabian nations , 8.17 % hungarians , 6.22 % spanish , 6.13 % austrians , and 4.52 % danish . 
  definitely mediterranean ... malta ? 
  that 's crazy enough to work . 
  guess i 'm french now . 
  well ... that 's exuberant !, 
  hopefully it wo n't pass through . 
  although i have nothing against ( though not for it either ) banning the hammer & sickle for propaganda purposes , banning organizations for being communists seems awfully close to thought crime ... ironically , pretty close to what the commies did . 
  getting tired of these articles and it 's barely february . 
  you 're out of your depth . 
  of course r. did n't exist back then , but the people considered themselves romanians . 
  even more so , we almost never use the word wallachia for the southern region ( it 's a foreign thing ) : we call ( ed ) it either * '' \u021aara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 '' * ( rom . 
  country , same word , note the spelling ) or `` muntenia '' ( although they refer to different things ) and we also did the same at the time . 
  i gave you a sourced link , did you bother to understand it ? 
  ** tl ; dr : ** first recorded spelling was in the 16th cent. , with an ` o ' . 
  people used both spellings in some regions , but the one with an ` u ' evolved to mean `` commoner '' , along with the fact that the `` u '' change did not happen in all provinces . 
  the first ( known ) use in writing by an official figure comes from the 18th century , also with an `` o '' .
