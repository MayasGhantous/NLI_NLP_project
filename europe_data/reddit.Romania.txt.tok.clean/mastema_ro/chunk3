  it is * not * a quirk of the governments . 
  and even if our past rulers insisted for the sake of insisting , what the heck does an english spelling borrowed from french have to do with anything ? 
  you can use whatever form you like and we have no say in it . 
  it 's not like you call finland suomi . 
  and as you quote that phrase from wikipedia you failed to read the rest of the sentence : `` with a few exceptions such as english and hungarian , in most languages , the `` u '' form is still used '' . 
  if anything it 's england 's own doing . 
   the fault of the romanian governments of the past for insisting on spelling it romania ( as it was customary for ~ 500 yrs . 
  and official for ~ 200 )  i 'm telling you like it is i seriously hope you 're trolling . 
  it 's like watching 2nd graders fight . 
   kid e : `` eww , you have cooties !, 
  do n't touch my stuff . '', 
   kid r : `` yeah ? 
  well ... my sister 's prettier than yours , neh-neh ! '', 
  i never bothered to look for it , but in my mind , `` arond '' was always associated with french , making it `` round a '' ( which would also make sense ) . 
  i really should track it down later today . 
  so your suggestion is to change the name of an independent country to avoid confusion with a minority population for the sole reason to confuse ignorant folk in the uk ? 
  it was such an obvious move all along . 
  but that 's the original spelling ? 
  wiki has [ an article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_romania ) on it with good citations . 
  pay attention to the paragraph starting with `` the self-designation of romanians as romans is mentioned [ ... ] '' . 
  personally , i find it funny to think that when people see `` roma '' they think of gypsies before rome . . 
  it 's funny how they have all 27 countries yet they still go for eu25 + others ( unless the numbers are from ' 06 ) . 
  in other news : i like to think of this not as `` dead fudging last '' , but first from the bottom . 
  ` mania !, 
  i tried plenty of times to explain the difference between racism and various other types of discrimination to people to no avail . 
  apparently if you call someone `` fat '' it 's racism . 
  so ... serbia removes an albanian memorial and albanians desecrate serbian tombs . 
  there 's no way this will end badly . 
  let 's not downplay the piss-poor management of said euro . 
  not sure what side to take , but as an advice to serbian albanians reading this : next time try to make it an artwork and display it on private land such as in the yard or in/on the facade of a private building, 
  i expect downvotes for my opinion , and even i hate to say it ( i really dislike orange ) , but o. did smart business : grabbed at the opportunity ( the bit about hollande threatening google ) and hit them where it hurts the most , marketshare . 
  if mobile pings to google servers were taxed i 'd switch to other solutions in a heartbeat . 
  i do n't know the full history and symbolism of the song ( though deusdies does explain a bit ) , but were n't most of our anthems ( for example ) sung during times of war ? 
  and we all had wars , quite a few actually . 
   working in the public sector is about 4-5 .000 euros a month . 
   holy fucking hell , that 's what a seasoned doctor makes in a month here !, 
  and then our seasoned doctors emigrate to italy for better wages . 
  really puts things in perspective . 
  we were already in every organization we applied for except schengen ( and the us has no say in it ) . 
  first words i said were : `` well , i 'm not offended by it ... '' . 
  i 'm not responsible for the other twenty million people , but i 'll pass it on when we next meet . 
  you 're missing the whole point . 
  we can live with the thief stereotype ; we wo n't like it and sometimes object , but usually people will understand it 's mostly a poke . 
  the gypsy stereotype goes above that and dismisses an entire culture . 
  i 'm sure you 'd like being called swiss ( not that it 's bad , just wrong ) over and over again . 
  tl ; dr : it 's not the stereotype , it 's the dismissal . 
  well , i 'm not offended by it , but the thing is : if a person identifies with an nationality/ethnicity and you dismiss that he 's going to take it worse than being called an [ adjective ] which most likely he 'll just shrug off . 
  also , if a particular bad stereotype about your country carries on long enough ( and being called a gypsy , does carry over the thief stereotype along with dismissing your ethnicity ) it just loses the humor . 
  ask the french how they find `` surrender monkey '' jokes . 
  because of an extradition treaty signed in '08 for heck-knows what reason . 
  good to know . 
  i have n't found that explanation , but it makes more sense that way . 
  interesting . 
  i have translated one of the definitions :  foreigner . 
  from o.sl . 
  n\u0115m\u012dc\u012d `` mute '' , from n\u0115m\u016d `` barbarian '' this apparently is sourced to a certain slovenian [ miklo\u0161i\u010d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franc_miklo%c5%a1i%c4%8d ) although the book in question is from 1886 , so there might be that . 
  i ca n't find his work at 3am and certanly ca n't read it , but it 's a nice chat . 
  i 'm sure it 's just an observation and a welcomed one . 
  i 'm just going by our dictionaries , where this is the prevalent explanation ( 2 for barbarian vs. 1 for mute ) . 
  did it mean the same thing at the time these names came up ? 
  mumbling/unintelligible seems pretty close in meaning with barbarian . 
  as in a person who could be described as primitive , uncivilized , inferior ; it seems a pretty easy derivation to make when crossing languages . 
  also , i never said we used the slavic word ; i said we use a word * coming * from it ( although i probably should n't have put the equal sign there ) . 
  it lists the words taken into account in the upper half of the image ( the all-text bit ) . 
  having close to no knowledge of the estonian language i think the eesti explanation is related to this interpretation found on wikipedia  `` due to alfred 's chorography referring to the same germanic tribe as tacitus , every variant of the anglicised east - , osti and the continental esti - equates to aestius , meaning eastern or east , that is * to the right side of the sea * as understood from the perspective of the germanic sailors who roamed the sea beyond the vistula estuary . '', 
  i know the map has flaws ; i found ( big ) errors regarding my language , so regarding talinn/taanilinn and liivimaa/liivamaa i must ask : is it just an error based on the similarity of the words or is there a chance for the names of the cities to have changed throughout history ? 
  the same germanic `` foreign/barbarian '' etymology is considered true for wallachia . 
  however a common romanian term for germans is `` neam\u021b '' , coming from the slavic `` n\u0115m\u012dc\u012d = barbarian '' . 
  it 's like a linguistic `` up yours !, 
  well , the duke would be a leader and he did command armies . 
  not surprisingly we also have the word , however `` voievod '' means king . 
  shameful as it is , may i claim ignorance and ask for an overview ? 
  the eu is in no way obligated to take the bulgarian side . 
  the greeks have been saying something similar for years and i do n't see the eu defending or getting involved in the fight . 
  and to be fair about it , the eu is more likely to give the `` stop with the crap '' talk to members than to outsiders . 
  the article says :  the greenlandic farmers and ranchers * switched * to a seafood-based diet * with surprising rapidity * . 
  from then on , the settlers focused their efforts on hunting the seals you say :  the scandinavians * refused to adapt * to the methods of survival used by the indigenous peoples the article says that they did adapt , they just got sick of it . 
  and it was well within their rights . 
  also , intermarriage is not a requirement . 
  i find it funny how you throw racism in there three times and arrogance twice . 
  methinks you are overlaying whatever contemporary bias you may have on top of this . 
  the story had a happy ending : they colonized for half a millennium , adapted to new surroundings and returned `` home '' of their own freewill . 
  nothing for you to judge . 
  true ... 
  i skipped half the title . 
  i 'm going to skirt this by calling it recent history , so there . 
  * whistles away *, 
  you 're funny !, 
  but seriously , i 'd go with the leaders of udmr , mark\u00f3 b\u00e9la and kelemen hunor ( udmr being the main hungarian minority party ) . 
  even if they were crap as ministers , as far as working towards the agenda of their party and their constituents they got everyone else beat by a mile . 
  this is regarding living politicians ; i 'm not touching the 1920-1960 era . 
  there are plenty around . 
  just a google search for `` smoking warnings studies '' yields quite a few . 
  however most i found were dealing with the effectiveness of informing the unknowing public ( thus a big part of the studies were areas with a significant rural population ) and the effectiveness of images vs. text warnings . 
  i did n't find many ( especially regarding europe ) regarding quitting . 
  imho , quite a large part of smokers know what they 're getting themselves into and choose to live with the risk , like i am . 
  however if it helps educate those who have n't or barely started smoking , or the ignorant regulars out there , that 's fine with me . 
  we have [ a similar one ] ( http://prajituricisialtedulciuri.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/bors-de-sfecla-cu-smantana2.jpg ) , but without the eggs and cucumbers and served with onions . 
  also 44/45 . 
  confused montenegro for kosovo .
