  shocked that the average is 27 though . 
  wooo ... we 're good at something . 
  now i just need to sober up to go and celebrate . 
   it was n't specifically for rugby . . fc steaua did really well too , gymnastics , lots of sports . 
  well , steaua with their recruiting policies in the late 80 's was as close to a national team as you can get but still being a club : for example for the '86 euros qualifiers the national team had 10/16 players from steaua [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/rumaenien-team/em-qualifikation-1986-1987/2/ ) , though i assume there are at least a few more players unlisted there . 
  gymnastics still gets some wins , though not as many as in the '80s or '90s ( but with the horror stories i read about the training regimes i 'm actually fine with that ) ; boxing and tennis are also at a reasonable level . 
  more interesting for me is [ the decline of our men 's handball team ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_men's_national_handball_team#world_championships ) . 
  with handball being arguably our 2nd most popular sport , they had great results in the world cup from '61 to '90 qualifying for all tournaments , only finishing outside the top 5 twice ( 7th and 9th ) , and winning it four times . 
  since 1990 we only qualified four times and were never better than 10th . 
  not sure , but you can use them in case of a vampire rebellion to hose them down . 
   i do n't think i ever saw a civilian carrying one according to [ this article ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/romania--tara-cu-cele-mai-putine-arme-din-ue-318879 ) we have the least number of lethal guns per capita in the eu . 
  and according to op 's edit , lowest in europe period . 
  it 's not like this entire area is known to be quite apt at removing kebab . 
  not really , this is just because we have historically pretty great relations with serbia . 
  hungarians already know they need to obey hungarian laws . 
  so non-hungarians , meaning those who `` come to hungary '' can read it ? 
  it is common sense after all , but if you bother paying for the damned signs , you may also want the target audience to be able to read it . 
  he is already under accusation , and they ca n't block the prosecution . 
  at most , they can delay his arrest warrant ( if proven guilty ) to come into effect until he steps down as pm or his mandate expires , by maintaining his immunity . 
  did n't think of that . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=6531 ) the official declaration from dna ( in romanian ) . 
  i 'm quite bad at translating legal terms , so pardon , but it says , roughly , that he is accused under criminal law of 17 counts of forged documents , one of being a continued complicit in tax evasion and one of money laundering . 
  so they sequestered all his movable and immovable propreties and he will go to trial . 
  however , why he only resigned as party leader and not as a pm is beyond me . 
  in any case , no need for elections , as we do n't ellect pms : they are named by the president and approved by the parliament . 
  the pres. 
  could , in theory , suspend him if he is brought on criminal charges for acts commited during his pm mandate , but in this case all 19 counts are from before , when he was a lawyer ( if i read it correctly ) . 
  it 's a bit up in the air at this point . 
  it was mostly a joke to try and keep spirits up . 
  but yeah , in western europe there was and still is this stereotype about lazy-thieving romanians , mostly reffering to gipsy gangs , but what can you do ? 
  plus that whole debacle in the uk with lifting visas for ro&bg . 
  and for sometime , with the ukrainian and greek crises , we went under the radar , and i found it most relaxing . 
  barely any gipsy threads these last few months . 
   edit : with regards to other comments : you do have to realize that there is a sense of frustration going on , when it comes to poland and the eastern countries . 
  most of us had large economic troubles in the past few decades , and went through ( mostly ) the same steps you were asked to : reduction of public sector and spending , tax and rates changes , vat increases , pension age increase , oversight on national budgets , etc. 
  we did it , it was not easy and we started off being weaker than you are now . 
  so regular people on the street , will hate you for what is perceived to be asking for prefferential treatment . 
  i for one blame both your country 's management and the foreign banks that loaned you all that cash . 
  most people on the other hand will only care about a few sound bites from the local news . 
   but its so tiring to be called lazy and corrupt and stupid and a thief at the very least , you did take the spotlight from us for a while ; these past few months were a breath of fresh air for me . 
   the degree of delusion and insanity is so high it 's almost impossible for normal people to comprehend what the fuck she 's thinking if she , and others like her , are willing to drop the benefits of living in some of the most developed and rich nations in the world ( speaking globally ) to willingly go to a war-zone where they 're stripped of most of the rights and advantages they had before ( healthcare , education , income , right to property , due process and trial , etc. ) ... 
  well , i 'm sure your countries are better off without them . 
  heck , i 'd laugh at them even if they left bucharest or sofia or belgrade to go to mosul , not to speak of rome or london or vienna . 
  / u/know _ worra_mean said :  no food or job ? 
  do n't complain , i know a guy who had his face explode in your metaphor , he said exactly the contrary : that there were places with no food or jobs , but that * only * greece will have its ' face explode . 
   unless nato is pushing him to uphold the 2 % of gdp per year on defense spending i doubt it 's that . 
  in january , the european comission denied our budget proposal of increasing military spending from 1.4 % to 1.7 % . 
  i did n't follow the subject closely , but from tid-bits of info i gathered from here and there , i believe we raised it anyway and now the ecb is pretty upset with us . 
  which would be fine if they did n't borrow money to buy something else , but , instead , actively went out shopping for a blade . 
  let me help you with [ that ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2015&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=44&amp;pr1.y=13&amp;c=914%2c946%2c962%2c122%2c181%2c913%2c124%2c921%2c943%2c963%2c918%2c138%2c142%2c964%2c182%2c960%2c968%2c423%2c922%2c935%2c128%2c135%2c942%2c939%2c936%2c961%2c172%2c132%2c184%2c134%2c174%2c144%2c146%2c944%2c176%2c178%2c136%2c926%2c112%2c111%2c967%2c941&amp;s=ngdpdpc%2cppppc&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) . 
  personally , i find the ukrainian ones better . 
  i 'm not up to date with this investigation , just gave you some sources , however , it 's in the 1st paragraph of the 2nd article that :  the austrian-based holzindustrie schweighofer , willingly and knowingly accepting illegally harvested timber and incentivizing additional cutting through a bonus system . 
  i honestly do n't care about the loggers nationality , they should all be punished if there are proven illegalities . 
  but what the public sees is that a tremendous amount of logs and wood are leaving the country with an austrian flag strapped to it ( metaphorically ) , that it is austrian money fueling the deforestation , and that an austrian company gets involved in the debate and the passing of laws . 
  and this makes people angry . 
  see a short presentation [ here ] ( http://www.ejolt.org/2015/05/cutting-illegal-cutters-deforestation-romania/ ) , but this is the most important bit :  der spiegel went on to expose the attempted cover up by the holzindustrie schweighofer management . 
  soon after , the romanian ministry of environment and climate change started a control at austrian group holzindustrie schweighofer 's local units in sebes and radauti . 
  the company started threats of leaving romania and the lost jobs this would cause and drumming the ` bad investor atmosphere ' drum . 
   massive deforestation has dramatically accelerated in romania between 2000 and 2011 , a period coinciding with the commencement of activity for three austrian companies in the wood products field : holzindustrie schweighofer , egger and kronospan . 
  the business model of these companies , especially schweighofer , has had a devastating impact on local communities , traditions and the environment , while ignoring the concept of sustainable development . 
  this has led to an estimated 50 000 job losses in the local economy so far . 
  compare this to the 3000 jobs created by holzindustrie schweighofer . 
  in the last 25 years , 400 000 ha of forest has been illegally cut in romania , causing an estimated damage of 5 billion euros . 
  according to a report from greenpeace romania , 3 ha are disappearing per hour . 
  a more detailed article is [ here ] ( http://eia-global.org/news-media/austrian-company-exposed ) , together with a video of the undercover investigation . 
   lets just go to war already [ ... ] i do n't care if russia has nukes i assume you 'd be saying the exact same thing if * your * country was 200km from them , right ? 
  we can probably base it in spain somewhere . 
  did n't bulgaria ask for some presentations/simposiums on the matter a few months ago and an experience exchange ? 
  did something come out of it , or was it just for show ? 
  also ... [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ndtlwcfgb8 ) was just brilliant !, 
  ( bulgarian tv crew coming to bucharest for an interview with a romanian anticorruption-bigwig only to find out he was arrested during their travel ) . 
  they ca n't get into european nordic so they try for american nordic . 
  wait , wait , wait ... fried [ fat with grease ] ( http://imgur.com/kxx7wfr ) ? 
  not necessarily . 
  in many cases those two do n't overlap : for example , see in the us the `` latino culture '' ( whatever that is ) being applied to mexicans , cubans , argeninians , chileans , colombians , etc. 
  ; peoples with different local cultures , different ethnicities , and nationalities . 
  as far as gipsies go , they are very monolithic as a culture , a culture that is confounded with ethnicity . 
  so , from my pov , yeah , in their case hating a culture is also hating the ethnicity . 
  i may be wrong , not an ethnologist . 
  true , as tolerant as i am , from time to time i find myself in the first quote . 
  however , i still realise that 's racist of me . 
  pretty sure a majority of people here realise it as well . 
  at least the idealist in me does . 
  but we kinda agree on that one . 
  [ ouch !, 
  ah , just wait a few days for the obligatory `` some random dude was arrested for stuff no one actually cares about '' thread . 
  why do i need to know this ? 
   why are you hiding such a great blogpost and such a great man from us ? 
  we 're not . 
  this guy 's unknown level is over 9000 , yet , if you look on the `` related '' tab , you 'll see that this was one of the most discussed threads on / r/romania lately . 
  but maybe you 'd like to share all hungarian anti-something blogs with us as well . 
  also , stop deflecting : the last time a right-wing candidate had any chance in the presidential elections was 15 years ago when he ( right-wing ) went on to the second round against a center-left candidate and he only got 33 % of the votes . 
  later edit : if you look at the post on / r/romania and translate that page , you 'll see most people talk about integration , education , foreign recognition and other civil stuff , although i guess you ca n't be bothered . 
  i did n't , / u/ragnar _ ok did . 
  last year , we alone [ overtook russia ] ( http://stiri.tvr.ro/moldova-smulge-avantaje-din-embargo-romania-ia-locul-rusiei-ca-partener-de-comert_52271.html ) as rm 's main trading partner after they signed the trade agreement , not to speak of the entire eu . 
  in any case , those separatists are n't going to win or lose their occupation with the money romania sends to russia after trade ( ~ 1bln last year ) . 
  they had a gdp of [ about 2000 billion last year ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp ) , our 1 billion is almost nothing . 
  and it would be unwise to cut all ties and contracts before we have the infrastructure and trade partners willing to fill that gap . 
  at the moment with the state of our industry and infrastructure , we need their exports more than they need ours . 
  let 's be smart and not rush this more than it needs to .
