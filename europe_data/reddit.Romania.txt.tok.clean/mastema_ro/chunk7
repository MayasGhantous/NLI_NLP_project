  yeah , it sounds [ very familiar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caritas_%28ponzi_scheme%29 ) . 
  competely agree !, 
  heck , if i were in some of those people 's situations there 's a chance i 'd do the same if i saw a chance ... honestly no idea , but not entirely out of the question . 
  however what people who keep using this phrase do n't get is that there 's a difference between what they want and what they need and that refugee status and refugee law are based on need not want . 
  and they * need * to be kept alive and healthy and busy ; any country in the eu can fulfill that for at least a few people ( and clearly others too , maybe kosovo or moldova could n't ) . 
  they do n't * need * to get to germany or further north . 
  i can only see the need if a ) other centers along the way are full , b ) they have family already there ( legally ) or c ) they are disabled in some way that poorer countries ca n't afford to accomodate . 
  the one in op 's post is actually the smaller of our three main breeds of shepherds ( there 's a smaller one , the [ ciobanesc corb/raven shepherd ] ( https://magdalovecipri.sunphoto.ro/poze_caini_ciobanesc_romanesc_de_bucovina/33262213 ) , but its ' use is quite local and a lot of folks wo n't think of it when asked about shepherds ) . 
  then you have the big three : the [ mioritic ] ( https://vantu.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/deb5.jpg ) ( the one in op 's post , literally sheep shepherd ) , the [ carpathian shepherd ] ( http://stirideneamt.ro/images/caine-ciobanesc-george-balan.jpg ) , and the largest - the [ bucovina shepherd ] ( https://maguta.sunphoto.ro/caini_ciobanesti_romanesti_crb_crc_crm_si_poate_unii_sunt_metisi_1/32409122 ) ( up to 80 cm high at the scruff ) . 
  no you ca n't / should n't have them indoors unless you own a palace - they do need a big yard , and they 'll need kilos of food per day ( the ones a friend of mine used to keep ate raw meat ; processed pellets may be more dense and require less of them ... dunno ) . 
  mind you , these kind of dogs do n't only have to keep wolves at bay , but also bears since we have about 6000 brown bears ( ~ 40 % of the eu total ) . 
  they are * more * likely to , but we know of just hundreds of dacian words , and more than half are `` retrofitted '' with the help of albanian ( mostly ) , or aromanian , or just with the lack of help of modern languages . 
  fact is , there are a few tens of dacian words written ( often transcribed in latin ) , and thracian is a whole ` nother kettle of fish . 
  on the other hand , even after the romans , we did n't have anything written for almost one and a half millenia after . 
  lots of shit happened : from the carps holding out , to the pechenegs , gepids , avars , huns , goths , sarmats and the mongols and everything after ( < - not in order ) . 
  and you can bet we took a syllable or a vowel or a word from each ... now try and find them with no documentation.for all you know , without going and researching , that z-word we have was actually an s-word , or a j-word in a turkic or aryan language that had no writing at the time ... see the challenge ? 
  my etymology dictionary says that `` z\u0103pad\u0103 '' came from pie via daco-thracian : gjemada  zemada  zabada  [ current form ] , because the word should have evolved differently if it came from o.sl . 
  `` zima '' . 
  on the other hand , the author is a known `` dacophile '' , and not really fond of slavs ... so meh . 
  for one i like the slavic hypothesis better , but i do n't have my name on a dictionary . 
  did you ever porn ? 
  darn it ... 
  i know . 
  `` come on '' , right ?

   well , thank you . 
  it 's good to have the support of the mighty nation of the ~ ~ north ~ ~ . 
  silly man , eesti ca n't into north . 
  nah , it 's on their side , but to answer to your other statement : yeah it 's richer - r.moldova 's gdp is at about 8bln usd ( varies a bit with the source ) while having ~ 3mln people , while the gdp of iasi county alone is at about 6bln estimated for this year , while having about 700-800k people ; add any other county in the region from the remaining 7 and you already surpassed their gdp with barely 1/2 of the population . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/edlyfqt ) the roma are the only ones going up . 
   what are you ~ ~ implying ~ ~ impaling ? 
  that poor gendarme is doomed . 
  poland : why do you have to be so ... umm , polish !, 
  [ not quite . 
  according to the [ last census from 2011 ] ( https://imgur.com/vu7tanf ) , there 's only about 620k of them . 
  granted , it 's very likely there 's more , either because some would n't self-identify as roma , some would n't be registered at all , or some could n't be found to answer , but i really doubt it 's a 400 % increase . 
  so what 's [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/udht04i ) ? 
  ( older than your post ), 
  it 's worse , the joker won !, 
  i ca n't remember the last time i actually loaded up google 's main page . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://cutelypoisoned.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/258troll_spray.jpg ), 
  yep , almost sure that 's hungarian . 
  yes . 
  only 25 % of romas declare their correct ethnicity in a 2011 anonymous census because nazis . 
  just so you know , this data would also be available in birth records , school forms , patient files , police reports , loan applications , a good portion of all contracts , and others , just in case another dictator pops up with a fetish for paper cuts . 
  welp , i 'm off now . 
  back in 5 hrs . 
  for more giggles . 
  actually , an official 2011 census likely trumps a 2007 study which ( without reading the book , i assume ) would be based on statistics and/or the ' 92 / '02 censuses ( the population fell by about 3.8 mill . 
  since '92 and by 2.7 since ' 02 ) . 
   considering the systemic discrimination faced by romanis in romania , i think it 's very possible . 
  i did say that it 's more than likely that some roma did this . 
  why i do n't believe them to be 1.8 million is because misreporting the ethnicity would indeed make sense on cvs , bank loan applications or similar documents , however it would be useless for a census ; i say this because regular citizens who would discriminate do n't have access to other citizens ' reports so there 's nothing to lose or gain by lying . 
  also , from personal and popular knowledge , romas are usually a proud people . 
   is something wrong in being a diverse country ? 
  nothing wrong with being diverse . 
  there is something wrong with not acknowledging black-on-white official figures which are not only more recent , but just like the study you quote , are also imposed/commissioned ( ? ), 
  and supervised by the eu . 
   i 'm sorry to say this but you come off like a racist . 
  i 'm sorry to say this , but you come off a bit dim . 
  edit : i did not downvote you . 
  the census results wheigh more than an infographic .

  translation :  [ ... ] and the number of those who declared themselves roma was 619.000 ( 3.2 % ) . 
  even if i 'd agree that some roma misreported their ethnicity , there 's no way in hell i 'll believe that 1.8 millions ( the difference to that map ) , meaning almost a full 10 % of the country 's population did this . 
  flame elsewhere . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=aui4bopnnvo#t=44s ) we have the french plan in exuberant video form . 
  it did declare independence , true , but there are still plenty of un members not recognizing it . 
  afaik , as a romanian or bulgarian , ( as the latest entries and poorest of the lot ) you can buy proprety in france and live there . 
  however there are work-visas for us where the french government opens a certain amount of jobs in certain domains ( presumably lacking ) for which you as an employee can apply and at which french companies are limited . 
  i for one , can understand why this happens and am certain that if we were in their shoes we 'd do the same thing , though the french do tend to be somewhat ( too ) nationalistic and extreme at times . 
  tl ; dr : you can live there but if you want to work and live it 's a bit more complicated . 
  why not ? 
  [ -4.36 , -6.10 ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=-4.38&amp;soc=-6.10 ), 
  that must have been boring . 
  next time just ask those in charge of counting ; they have some newfangled counting machines and stuff . 
  actually , they 're about 620k , or 3.2 % of the population according to the preliminary census results ( [ pdf ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/comunicat_date_provizorii_rpl_2011_.pdf ) page 5 , in romanian ) . 
  even if it 's likely that some of them did n't declare themselves as roma , i fail to see how you reached those numbers . 
  seems accurate . 
  i just had a herd of elephants run by my window this morning . 
  sorry , but if they came in europe from either n or s of the black sea , bulgaria and/or ukraine were the first stops . 
  almost right , but not fully : actually , they are/should be removed from the * main electoral lists * ( `` liste electorale principale '' ) . 
  they then should be moved to the supplementary lists ( `` liste electorale suplimentare '' ) . 
  source : [ foreign affairs ministry , 2012 referendum voting faq , question 5 ] ( http://www.mae.ro/node/14723 ) . 
  translated into english :  on what type of electoral lists will citizens abroad be found on ? 
   romanian citizens may vote abroad at any voting station , them being assigned to the supplementary lists . 
  an issue would be if they still have n't moved you , but you should still be on a list , albeit a different one . 
  edit : these sup . 
  lists also apply to citizens voting inside the country but not at the section assigned to their place of residence . 
  i myself voted on it because i was travelling at the time .
