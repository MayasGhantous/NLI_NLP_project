   i 've left romania more than a year ago , and i should n't be on the lists , but i still am you are because you should be . 
  as habarnam said , you only lose the right to vote if you lose your citizenship . 
  assuming that , most likely , you received the citizenship through birth , there 's no way for you to lose it .

  pretty much correct , but i 'm not sure if this blog post is interesting enough for r/europe . 
  edit : just to make myself clear , i 've nothing against the article , but i do n't want to see this sub filled with travellers ' impressions . 
  i had no idea haggard covered it . 
  polandball is type of comics similar to the rage ones , where countries are drawn as balls painted in the national flag . 
  they usually involve some countryballs doing something together and polandball either getting pwned or failling miserably . 
  [ subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball ) , [ external page ] ( http://ohinternet.com/polandball ) . 
  one of the most famous ones is [ this one ] ( http://mybfolder.org/albums/userpics/10001/1264092310299.png ), 
  in this case , i clearly misread . 
  cheers !, 
  yes , i 'm the one who does his best to come with external excuses and blame everyone but his nation for its failings ( like the nazis did ) . it 's not a crime ; every nation everywhere has its ' flaws . 
  just for shits and giggles , if you check my comment history , you 'll see that `` 3 days ago '' i posted in [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/uucyy/2009_eu_profiler_you_answer_a_series_of_3035/ ) , and see that i declared my position according to that test to be centre-left ( more left than centre ) . 
  now , if you can find me a romanian extreme right-winger who publicly declares himself to be nearest to the hungarian minority party as ideology then , by all means . . 
  i 'm a nazi . 
  also , you : `` bitch '' . 
  really ?

  i ca n't speak for bulgaria and its citizens , but we here in the east seem to lose perspective because we 're always comparing ourselves to germany , austria , uk and france . 
  we keep forgetting of how many places * way * ( and i really mean * way * ) worse places there are to live in . 
  and those places are within a few hundred kilometres . 
  you , my friend who deletes all comments when he ca n't come up with a rational rebuttal , should learn the difference between : `` greeks are morons '' ( a position which no sane person can defend ) and `` fateswarm is a moron '' ( fbass ' opinion , with which i wholeheartedly agree ) . 
  no , you said :  germany would be successful if was put in the middle of africa ? 
  and  me : are you seriously comparing bulgaria , serbia and turkey to dr congo and cameroon ? 
   you : yes . 
  i do compare them . 
  let me translate this to you : if you 'd pull out germany and dump it in central africa it would have the same lack of success ( i can assume economic since we 're not talking sports here ) that greece enjoys at the moment with ( and because of ) the neighbours it has . 
   me : you 're saying that there 's the same financial & economic difference  you : no [ ... ] i said it 's an analogy . 
  what ? 
  is it yes or no ? 
  i made a direct analogy based on what you said . 
  that 's what it means : comparing two situations ( the ones described above ) and coming to the same conclusions  you , 1 hour ago : germany would be successful if was put in the middle of africa ? 
   you , 1 minute ago : germany was put in the middle of the balkans . 
  learn to keep a coherent thought . 
  the one thing i 'd agree with is that , yes , most likely it would n't be * as * successful . 
  however that 's hypothetical and completely irrelevan . 
  going out . 
  will be back in 3 hours most likely . 
  good analogy ? 
  you 're saying that there 's `` almost '' the same financial & economic difference between germany and central african countries as between greece and bulgaria ? 
  gim me a break !, 
  it 's not like we got a lot of money from ukraine and moldova and do n't require a bailout ( not that we 're successful in any way ) ; and then there are countries , like spain , who are , and are on the border of powerful economies that do . 
  i would think that you 'd realize that with the inventions of ships , planes , online trading and banking you do n't really need direct borders for a flow of money ( well , it 's a plus to have , but it 's not * that * important ) . 
  stop blaming albania for your economic blunders . 
  ps : i know the geography , but it 's one of the major players in the area and less then 200km from your borders . 
  edit : mostly typos and a verb on line 4 . 
  are you seriously comparing bulgaria , serbia and turkey to dr congo and cameroon ? 
  i understand that fyrom may be less glamorous then the czech rep. , but let 's try and remain honest for a minute . 
  while you did have less money pumped in by your neighbours buying your stuff ( comparatively to germany or france ) , they did n't affect you that much , on the contrary : [ greek trade partners ] ( http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/greece/export-import.html ) . 
  i think i see your ( almost ) neighbours cyprus , bulgaria , romania and italy on that `` top 7 '' list of best export partners . 
  also from the article : '' [ ... ] in 2009 . 
  the country , in terms of export volume , ranked 65th in the world and thus was * far below the eu rankings * . '', 
  now let 's just take off those rose glasses and stop blaming those who actually help . 
  you 'd be on the top of the world if it were n't for those pesky bulgarians . 
  i know it 's probably visibly an older pic , but i 'll just go ahead and make a note that it 's at the latest from 2004 ( a.n. 
  quit the prime minister position in dec. / ' 04 ) . 
  welp ... 
  i got closest to udmr ( hungarian minority party ) . 
  there 's something i never even considered . 
  i always liked greek myself , but i was never able to learn it .

  [ ` p ^ j a.tsa ] q : does anyone know how to escape ^ without space ? 
  i can maybe understand the confusion between dutch/holland/netherlands for a new learner , but who had these brainfarts :  danes are from what country  armenians are from what country, 
  if it helps , all articles i could find on this say that the imf and the european commission ( did i translate this right ? ), 
  have approved it by allowing the deficit to rise . 
  the money will supposedly come from a previous ( and untouched/untouchable ) imf loan of 5 billion ron ( ~ 1.2 bln eur ; bln . 
  in shortscale as in 1.2 * 10 ^ 9 ) for national emergencies . 
  insights come from the press , so i ca n't be sure of the accuracy . 
  however , the law must be passed before the 25 ^ th ( ca n't increase wages with less than 6 months before elections ) so more details will come out shortly . 
  terrible political move by the opp . 
  this stopped the negotiations for imf funds and now they get to govern a country in debt , with austerity measures in place and no money coming in . 
  it will be fun come fall elections . 
  the only popular move they could do ( economy-wise ) is to remove the austerity policies and that would n't end well . 
  at present we simply do n't have the coin to gain/cover the debt on our own . 
  there are two phrases which involve `` west ''  by this stage in roman history the west was weak ... 
  which i undestand as the [ western roman empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_roman_empire ) as a whole ( because of the mention of lombards which would be in the n or ne of the empire ) or , less likely , the western part of the empire which would be ... in the west . 
  i do n't think he meant `` the west '' as you understood it because `` lombardy in northern italy '' is usually thought of as central european . 
  though that may be just me . 
   mass movement of people into western europe i find this self explanatory : the western part of the continent . 
  western europe was still at the western end of europe back then . 
  he was most likely sarcastic/flaming . 
  does n't work like that . 
  reddit made me so cynical . 
  in case of vague , assume the worst . 
   in your native language . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 we have * many * native languages . 
  however i believe it 's a hungarian name so you could try [ r/hungary ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hungary ), 
  so many boys named luca and here i am knowing none of them .
