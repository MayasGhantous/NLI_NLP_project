  how ? 
  throughout the campaign , cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering article 50 straight away . 
  whether implicitly or explicitly , the image was clear : he would be giving that notice under article 50 the morning after a vote to leave . 
  whether that was scaremongering or not is a bit moot now but , in the midst of the sentimental nautical references of his speech yesterday , he quietly abandoned that position and handed the responsibility over to his successor . 
  and as the day wore on , the enormity of that step started to sink in : the markets , sterling , scotland , the irish border , the gibraltar border , the frontier at calais , the need to continue compliance with all eu regulations for a free market , re-issuing passports , brits abroad , eu citizens in britain , the mountain of legistlation to be torn up and rewritten ... the list grew and grew . 
  the referendum result is not binding . 
  it is advisory . 
  parliament is not bound to commit itself in that same direction . 
  the conservative party election that cameron triggered will now have one question looming over it : will you , if elected as party leader , trigger the notice under article 50 ? 
  who will want to have the responsibility of all those ramifications and consequences on his/her head and shoulders ? 
  boris johnson knew this yesterday , when he emerged subdued from his home and was even more subdued at the press conference . 
  he has been out-maneouvered and check-mated . 
  if he runs for leadership of the party , and then fails to follow through on triggering article 50 , then he is finished . 
  if he does not run and effectively abandons the field , then he is finished . 
  if he runs , wins and pulls the uk out of the eu , then it will all be over - scotland will break away , there will be upheaval in ireland , a recession ... broken trade agreements . 
  then he is also finished . 
  boris johnson knows all of this . 
  when he acts like the dumb blond it is just that : an act . 
  the brexit leaders now have a result that they can not use . 
  for them , leadership of the tory party has become a poison chalice . 
  when boris johnson said there was no need to trigger article 50 straight away , what he really meant to say was `` never '' . 
  when michael gove went on and on about `` informal negotiations '' ... why ? 
  why not the formal ones straight away ? 
  ... he also meant not triggering the formal departure . 
  they both know what a formal demarche would mean : an irreversible step that neither of them is prepared to take . 
  all that remains is for someone to have the guts to stand up and say that brexit is unachievable in reality without an enormous amount of pain and destruction , that can not be borne . 
  and david cameron has put the onus of making that statement on the heads of the people who led the brexit campaign . 
  i would like to remind everyone that farage said they should do a 2nd referendum '' if it 's close '' . 
  it vague , how close is '' close '' , intentionally though without a doubt , but it is a bit hypocritical if '' close '' applies only to one side . 
  oh it is a great blow to boris . 
  he gave him the keys of a burning house . 
  i re-watched got recently and i think this quote fits the situation . 
  '' his joy will turn to ashes in his mouth '' i see little reasons for boris to be happy about these . 
  the uk may very well end under his term . 
  while cameron can go down in history as a bit of a idiot who tried to keep the country together but lost against the crazies . 
  i heard there will be a no-confidence vote in the labour party . 
  could corbyn lose ? 
  if so who is likely to replace him ? 
  i do think corbyn 's inaction , at least this is how it 's seen from here , hurt the results , if he campaigned harder and with more passion , perhaps he could get enough people to vote . 
  because the remains problem was n't the lack of voters but rather that young people do n't actually go out and vote . 
  compare this with the very well mobilization of the leave campaign and the simple truth that old people are far , far more likely to go out and cast their vote . 
  agree it is a unknown right now . 
  one thing , though this comment is right about is that cameron really put boris in a bad position . 
  does he want to be pm ? 
  sure . 
  but does he want to be the one to pull the trigger ? 
  the one under whos watch scotland left the uk ? 
  i doubt it . 
  i think he truly expected cameron will go to this until the end . 
  but cameron just threw all the problems in their yard . 
  a briliant move in my opinion . 
  another correct observation is , that there is little joy . 
  there is hardly any feel of '' victory '' , backpadlling and '' no need to hurry '' looks to be the feeling right now . 
  here 's a very interesting comment someone posted on the guardian , it is worth a read , in my opinion : if boris johnson looked downbeat yesterday , that is because he realises that he has lost . 
  perhaps many brexiters do not realise it yet , but they have actually lost , and it is all down to one man : david cameron . 
  with one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am , cameron effectively annulled the referendum result , and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of boris johnson , michael gove and leading brexiters who cost him so much anguish , not to mention his premiership .

  i honestly believe they did n't think they would actually leave ... look at farage backtracking on promises the leave side made . 
  boris saying there '' is n't any hurry to leave '' ... etc. 
  i do think this is a strong waking call for politicians though . 
  i have no problem with people disliking or wanting to leave the eu . 
  but they needed to be honest about things . 
  if they did n't knew the consequences they should just have admited it . 
  boris was traveling the country in a bus with a outright lie on it . 
  farage while having no official position in the campaign did n't say anything about the nhs before the vote . 
  but the biggest leason we must learn from this , is what cameron did . 
  he tried to eat the cake and still have it . 
  he wanted to beat labour and started to court the ukip vote , but he never agreed with them and he never truly wanted these people . 
  he only wanted them for that election and then dispose of them . 
  one a funnier note , this is like cersei giving weapons to the sparrows and expecting them only to hurt the tyrells ... 
  politics is a passion of mine . 
  a masochistic one most often ... 
  so it needs only a majority . 
  but the member states still have their veto power right ?
