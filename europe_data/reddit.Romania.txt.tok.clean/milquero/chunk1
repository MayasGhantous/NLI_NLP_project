they will get better once we get back to 5-6 % economic growth . 
  good omens for that . 
  it had ~ 10 % russians when it was annexed by the ussr . 
  russian land !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_1940_soviet_ultimatum this happened in 1940 . 
  invasion of ussr , 1941 . who was the aggressor again ? 
   remember , your ancestors were the aggressors . 
  [ you have got to be kidding me ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1.0-9/535242_342854305780563_2042712398_n.jpg ) . 
  so after the ussr signs a friendship pact with nazi germany and then annexes the eastern part of romania , somehow we are the aggressors for fighting back ... 
  perfect soviet logic . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ribbentrop-molotov_pact http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_1940_soviet_ultimatum  * between 1940 and 1941 , 200,000 to 300,000 romanian bessarabians were persecuted , conscripted into forced labor camps , or deported with the entire family , of whom 18,000 to 57,000 were supposedly killed . 
  * when the russians arrived , they did things more barbaric and unthinkable than the nazis ever had , and these things will not be forgotten . 
  when the local populace thinks of red army soldiers as ** worse than the nazis ** , are you sure you 're really the good guys ? 
  and that kind of contrived superiority is also why people here do n't like you or your country . 
  we were always squeezed between imperialists ( ottomans , austro-hungarians , russians ) and always had to pick sides and defend ourselves from their ambitions . 
  today , if russian troops were somehow placed in romania i can guarantee you would end up with guerrilla warfare . 
  but there are already american , canadian or western european troops and people happily wave flags at their air shows , because they are seen as friends and protectors - mainly against russia . 
  again , does that tell you something about how much eastern europe dislikes you ? 
  i have immense satisfaction when i see the statues of lenin toppled all over ukraine . 
  we did that too , 25 years ago . 
  i can only hope that soon the european parliament follows in the footsteps of eastern european countries and finally bans the hammer & sickle sign , putting it where it belongs - on the exact same shelf as the swastika . 
  and you think russia can do whatever it wants in europe ... ? 
  do n't you realize nobody is a fan of russia on the continent , and even more so in eastern europe ? 
  poland , hungary , the czechs/slovaks and romania all have intense dislike for russia ( for things like ww2 , communism , ' 56 , ' 68 ) , now ukraine hates russia , and estonia , latvia and lithuania would probably detach it from earth and send it into outer space if they could . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  why do you think all of the countries above have very gladly oriented themselves toward `` those westerners '' ? 
  it 's so sad , there are so many things to admire about russia , such culture and science , but its bullying strategies in eastern europe ( and not only ) leave a much , much stronger impression on every single generation ... dostoyevsky is all fine and dandy until the `` brave ~ ~ soviet ~ ~ russian soldier '' comes barging in . 
  do n't say `` the '' ukraine . 
  it 's seen as condescending ( as if it was a mere territory , not a country ) from what i gather . 
  either way , i think we probably will . 
  either that or we put the faces from our current bills onto the coins , just to confuse everyone about who these people are . 
  or dracula . 
  aww yisss . 
  i live abroad and have a stash of green 1 leu bills to give away as presents to intrigued foreigners . 
  i was reading there is a law somewhere that says romanian-generated currency has to have the [ coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg/670px-coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg.png ) on it . 
  so no dracula . 
  you do know that romanians and gypsy/roma are two completely unrelated ethnic groups , yes ? 
  edit : it seems like he/she is romanian and was in fact saying how natives recognize the gypsy/roma ... 
  [ r/polandball is always relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1z81y7/ukraines_great_sacrifice/ ), 
  the stations look very , very cool !, 
  glad to see the designers had balls and did something different . 
  makes the wait worth it . 
  what i wonder is if the stations also have an electronic ticket system , or bkv employees freezing their asses off in the winter months ... 
  those soviet cars had something homey about them , though . 
  same old ones every time i visited budapest , i 'll miss them in a way . 
  imagine putting flashy modern cars on the yellow line ... 
  antwerp is cool . 
  there 's that bar with statues near the cathedral , i once had a long , sunny afternoon on the terrace there drinking flemish beers . 
  gent , however , is the most beautiful city i 've seen in western europe . 
  sometimes i see cars with `` cat '' put over the `` e '' , roaming around western europe . 
  kind of passive-aggressive , but funny . 
  i once ended up in debrecen by mistake ( was supposed to get off at p\u00fcsp\u00f6klad\u00e1ny and change onto a romanian train , but kept going ) . 
  once i got off in debrecen , my next train to oradea was many hours later , so i just got a map and wandered around the city . 
  it 's really very beautiful and has a nice atmosphere about it . 
  there 's that central boulevard running from the train station , lined with art deco buildings and neat little cafes ... 
  it leads to the yellow cathedral downtown and the park behind it , then to a shopping mall and a large beautiful park with statues . 
  there was also a central hotel that had the hungarian , romanian and slovakian flags in front , which i thought was a nice touch . 
  i also had a fantastic lunch at a random restaurant on a side street . 
  bottom of the story is , even if i had plenty of time until my next train , i almost missed it and had to run to the train station because i was walking around on some streets downtown . 
  i 've been to other hungarian `` province '' towns , particularly in western hungary , but debrecen has something special to it . 
  maybe because it 's a bit tucked away and off the beaten path ( like gy\u0151r would be , for instance ) , so one feels like discovering a hidden gem . 
  hah , those look cool . 
  i wish they would make some of them permanent fixtures for lenin pedestals around the country . 
  especially the ones that are political statements ( with the hydra/roses , and lenin melting ) . 
  that would just put them under the international spotlight and give them an extra reason to cry out that they 're being oppressed , thus working in their favour . 
  and gdp per capita does n't mean much itself . 
  libya had fairly high numbers due to its oil exports , but it did n't mean the general populace enjoyed good living standards ... 
  yes , when they were the ones joking . 
  not somebody else making fun of their ordeal . 
  honestly i would n't know , i 've only been there twice , as a tourist . 
  usually where there 's a lot of tourists you 'll find a lot of pickpockets ( see barcelona ) , but most of them are not violent and also not locals . 
  when the tourist season goes , they go . 
  but i 've spent time living in brussels and i felt less safe than in any eastern european city i 've been to . 
  the shady characters there are really ` locals ' - perhaps not exactly belgian , but certainly live there ... 
  coming from a romanian : absolutely . 
  i never felt unsafe in hungary , even in the capital , even in the poorer areas of the capital . 
  smaller towns feel delightful . 
  brussels ? 
  man , you wo n't catch me at midday in some areas ( hello western brussels ) , let alone evening , and if i have to go there it 's with my car doors locked and as quickly as possible . 
  many of the people i know in brussels have gotten mugged at some point in their lives , most recently last week . 
  despite living fairly close to our border , i had never met any ukrainians until recently ... 
  but the four i did meet in the past two years , all from kyiv , are now some of the nicest , smartest people i know . 
  and certainly more `` european '' in thinking than many residents of western countries that i 've come across in my life . 
  i watch the news every day and i hope everything turns out for the best , even though no one really knows what `` best '' would mean right now . 
  fingers crossed from a neighbour . 
  `` bulgaria plans to join the eu '' ? 
  bulgaria has been a member for 7 years . 
  also sorry for hijacking this thread a bit , but serious question here : what is your take on the possible union of romania and moldova , if agreed through referenda ? 
  would n't russian ethnics there live a better life in the eu than they do now ? 
  what will happen with transnistria , seeing how it is still part of moldova , and would ergo become part of romania/eu ? 
  on a slightly less serious note , where is our damn thesaurus ? 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_treasure / romanian who spent this nye drinking with russians from tomsk, 
  we get called mamaligari because we eat mamaliga/polenta ( and love it ) . 
  it 's only used in transylvania . 
  normally it should be ` mul\u0163umesc frumos ' , but instead you have a contraction and a german loanword . 
  it must be very endearing to them to hear you use regional speech like a true local . 
  both hungarians and romanians claim they were first to settle in transylvania ( whose removal from hungary and integration into romania was inked in the trianon treaty after wwi ) . 
  a romanian shepherd sees a man in the distance about to drink from a well and yells `` do n't drink , it 's poisoned ! '' . 
  the man yells back with a hungarian accent : - what did you say ? 
  - i said drink slowly , the water is cold !,
