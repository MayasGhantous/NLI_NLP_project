  a man walks into a bar in transylvania with a bear on a leash . 
  - excuse me , do you serve hungarians here ? 
  - we do , what shall i bring you ? 
  - a beer for me and two hungarians for him !, 
  a group of people discuss whose language is more difficult . 
  the frenchman says : `` sometimes it makes little sense even to us . 
  for instance we pronounce bordo but it 's written bordeaux . '', 
  a szekler says : `` for us in szeklerland it 's even worse . 
  for instance we pronounce \u00c1llom\u00e1s but it 's written gar\u0103 ... '' a romanian village is invaded by locusts . 
  the mayor goes to a witch in the forest . 
  she gives him a tiny blue locust and instructs him to place it in the middle of the village . 
  he does so , and suddenly all locusts in the village gather around the tiny blue locust , only to fly away together , far away from the village . 
  years later , the same village is invaded by stray dogs . 
  the mayor goes to the witch again , and receives a tiny blue dog with the same instructions . 
  he places it in the middle of the village , and all dogs promptly queue up behind the tiny blue one and leave the village . 
  that same night , the mayor goes knocking at the witch 's hut . 
  - hey ... 
  listen ... you would n't happen to have a tiny blue hungarian , would you ? 
  the hungarians arrive in transylvania . 
  no one in sight , only beautiful wild nature . 
  next to a river , they get off their horses to bathe and enjoy the crystal blue waters . 
  when they return to the shore , they are shocked to discover that all their horses and clothes are gone . 
  instead , they find a small note : `` mul\u0163am fain ! '', 
  ( `` thanks a lot ! '', 
  in romanian transylvanian accent ), 
  i chuckled . 
  somehow it 's always vegetables/foodstuffs that get messed up by dialects . 
  romania is a medium-sized country by european standards and yet there are at least three well identified regions that have different names for many of their vegetables . 
  if you add the republic of moldova ( relationship is similar to germany-austria ) it gets much more complicated . 
  from my time in southern germany i remember being warned not to ask for konfit\u00fcre in the shops . 
  when i was 10 i also brought my cousin in bayern a screaming-yellow team-shirt of borussia dortmund , which is very funny when i think of it now . 
  `` it 's german , so he will love it '' . 
  his friends did n't find it funny . 
  as for the swiss ... all the proper sounds are there , but it sounds like someone put them in a blender first . 
  or as someone eloquently put it , `` it 's like a german trying to speak whilst falling down the stairs '' . 
  `` hochdeutsch [ ... ] is also used to refer to standard german , a standardized form of the german language ( standarddeutsch ) , used as a written language , in formal contexts , and for communication between different dialect areas , which everybody in the german-speaking regions is supposed to understand , and which is taught to foreigners . '', 
  that 's how our professors always used the term . 
  but in any case , while having heard austrian german before , seeing it in writing makes me chuckle . 
  i always thought it was more of an accent , with the words being written mostly the same way ( like british v. american english ) . 
  my years of studying hochdeutsch in school did not prepare me for this . 
  the md-ro dictionary is epic . 
  similar , yes , but different species . 
  i 'm laughing like an idiot . 
  i have to subscribe . 
  having taken the rer , i burst out laughing when i read that one . 
  brilliant . 
  others are damn funny too .
