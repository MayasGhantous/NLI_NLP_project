  straight from grandma 's forwarded e-mails , but : `` europeans think 100 miles is a long distance ; americans think 100 years is a long time . '', 
  sure , fjords are pretty , but seeing the aurora borealis has been at the top of my bucket list for years . 
  years !, 
  problem is , everything else in europe is kind of ` in the neighborhood ' , but going to norway feels like going to that corner shop way across the bridge when you have a big supermarket next door - one of beautiful cities that are within driving distance . 
  but , okay , when i run out of things to see in this side of europe , aurora borealis it is . 
  just keep the lutefisk at bay . 
  there has always been a sizable german-speaking population in hungary , but they were never discriminated against , despite often having professions that were associated with wealth or being richer on average than the rest of the native population . 
  perhaps it 's that germans were always known to be germans , slovaks were always known to be slovaks , while jews , in fear of earlier religious persecution , often preferred to take hungarian names , hide their origin and mingle with the rest of the population . 
  the same happened in pre-ww2 romania . 
  when someone does that one starts to wonder what they have to hide ( or makes up theories on zionism ) , and in turn isolates and persecutes them for what had initially started off as a way to avoid persecution . 
  but the entire jewish discussion is a bit out of my league , so colour me uninformed . 
  as for hungarian politicians over here , there are some who 've probably gained many fans in the far-right crowd in hungary - like t\u0151k\u00e9s l\u00e1szl\u00f3 . 
  he is the man who lit the fuse for the romanian revolution of 1989 , which could have transformed him into a longstanding folk hero , and somehow he still manages to be one of the most hated figures in public discourse because of his extremism . 
  conversely , there are plenty of hungarian athletes , actors and other public figures whose ethnicity is recognized , but simply not an issue when it comes to the respect we have towards them . 
  romanians , just like anyone else , prefer being sweet talked and reassured to having their hands twisted . 
  rmdsz should have acted accordingly , but they were indeed too busy being corrupt and enjoying the perks of public office . 
  on that front , i must say i 'm in a once-in-a-lifetime agreement with the hungarian far-right . 
  it is always a bit surprising to hear about present-day antisemitism in hungary . 
  it 's just not on the radar at all over here , and neither is anti-antisemitism , despite us being a neighboring country . 
  then again , there are only a few thousand jews left - most ww2 survivors emigrated to israel . 
  still , i think the faults of jewish politicians and representatives there are mistakenly reflected onto the general populace . 
  the same is true for hungarians in romania . 
  especially in transylvania , we do realize that the vast , vast majority of hungarians are hard-working people who care more about their jobs and their day-to-day issues than they do about territorial ones . 
  it 's a bit worse in the south - rmdsz politicians are the only hungarians most people over there have ever heard or seen , and they believe the rest are just like them . 
  in turn , the country-wide anti-hungarian public discourse even makes some people here wonder whether the friendly hungarian lady at the market stand indoctrinates her kids at home , telling them that romanians are evil . 
  i know there are extremists on both sides , but i feel that many politicians and community leaders stir things up instead of looking for the right solutions . 
  to be frank , if one of the aforementioned ethnic communities wanted more local autonomy , i would n't have anything against it . 
  i would go there to visit and enjoy having a traditional dinner in their midst , take a picture with their flag , leave with a smile and be proud this can happen in romania . 
  the turks are the first that come to mind , they 've lived near the black sea for centuries ( i think before we did ) . 
  hungarians took the wrong path and failed to present themselves as a friendly community . 
  my fear is that it 's too late to turn back . 
  in my mind i 've always compared the hungarian/szekler link to the romanian/moldovan one , because it also includes a strong linguistic component ( thick accent / dialect ) . 
  the difference between the mo\u0163i and someone from vaslui is like the one between vaslui/craiova , nothing too special . 
  and you should know there are also demands regarding partium , which only make romanians more uneasy about the szekler issue . 
  this would be in the context of eu-imposed autonomy . 
  the `` listening '' has been done without any finger-pointing or showing during the past 20 years ( and when i say 20 , i mean 20 , not 23 ) . 
  remember that the udmr/rmdsz was more often a part of the governing alliance than in the opposition . 
  yes , but i feel we have reached an acceptable level . 
  we have automatic parliamentary representation to bypass the normal electoral thresholds , there are schools in languages ranging from czech and bulgarian to hungarian and serbian ... 
  i do not get a sense of government-mandated oppression anywhere in the country , really . 
  far from it . 
  as for the gypsy , what strikes me sometimes is seeing trilingual city signs in romanian , hungarian and german , even though the german population of said city is now far , far , under the gypsy one . 
  but i guess germans are more marketable . 
  every country is different . 
  the italian people lived a large part of their history in a mish-mash of numerous duchies and kingdoms , each with their own culture and traditions - a unified , centralized state would be an exception from the rule . 
  romanians , on the other hand , have met their largest historical successes after unifying . 
  to go a notch down would be seen as a step backward . 
  to compare the szeklers to the basque or catalans is also erroneous . 
  if anyone in europe should be independent , it 's the basque - they are a people unlike any other on the continent . 
  the catalans should also be allowed to do their own thing , since they are not spanish any way you look at it . 
  the hungarian flags flown in the szeklerland , though , tell me these are not a people in the actual sense of the word , but a more or less estranged group of hungarians , putting them in the category of national minorities that are to be given just as many rights as any other minority here . 
  i do n't see any of the other communities up in arms over a lack of rights . 
  bucharest , backed by the rest of the country . 
  you can imagine how well autonomy would fare in the minds of the general populace . 
  though i honestly feel like i 'm talking about the colonization of io or europa . 
  i can not imagine a palatable scenario where these things would actually take place within our lifetimes . 
  the eu has a lot of leverage on serbia regarding kosovo , but it has no interest in ruining its image in the 7th largest member state for the sake of a hungary that is already at odds with the founding principles of the union . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  if romania were to give them autonomy , it would be accompanied by a middle finger . 
  i 'm not sure what those 2-3 counties produce apart from timber ( hungarian politician and `` timber oligarch '' verest\u00f3y attila would know best ) , but i do not expect them to turn into an economic powerhouse over the course of this century . 
  like bezbojnicul says , russia is hated , not russians themselves - there are n't that many in romania anyway . 
  as for ukraine , our governments have had a number of small territorial disputes in the past couple of decades , but they were all resolved diplomatically and did not later resurface . 
  ukrainians in romania form a rather friendly community , and romanians in ukraine also live peaceful lives . 
  when it comes to hungarians , i feel the problem does not necessarily lie in early 20th century history , but in post-1990 issues . 
  the hungarian community and especially its politicians are seen as pushy , demanding , aggressive and , for lack of a better word , annoying . 
  no other community does this , be it ukrainians , jews , saxons , turks , tatars , serbs , bulgarians etc. , which is probably why there is no animosity towards any of them , even though we had political feuds with most throughout history . 
  we do n't blame present-day turks for what the ottoman empire did , nor do we blame russians for what the ussr did . 
  memories of ww2 hungarian-led massacres only resurface in the context of present-day disputes . 
  they 're not a border region , they would be an autonomous enclave . 
  how would cutting themselves off from the rest of romania bring them any actual benefits ? 
  pretty flags do n't put bread on the table . 
  more than russia does , for instance . 
  including greater willingness to be a part of the club and play by its rules . 
  and it 's not really about religion , albania is largely muslim and i consider it more european than any of the countries above . 
  it 's more about culture - where religion does play a big part , but the two do not overlap completely . 
  nobody should try to export their homegrown ideals to other places on the globe ( ask the us ) , but rather import the best bits they see around . 
  i imagine the world as developing into a number of cooperating blocs , and i really hope constructions like the african union live up to their enormous potential - within the un framework , but on their own terms and will . 
  turkey is an excellent ally , both to the eu and to nato , but the eu does not have a global vocation . 
  countries like russia , turkey or those in the maghreb should not be in the eu not just because of the economic or human rights admission criteria , but because they can do their own thing on the world arena . 
  others like georgia or armenia , though further away geographically , have a lot more in common with the european idea . 
  an eu with countries that are not `` european '' is no longer the eu . 
  lol - the per capita gdp of greece is more than double ( ! ), 
  that of turkey , cyprus is closer to triple , and that of bulgaria is in the same ballpark . 
  when ordinary people in the eu see turkey , they think `` no thanks '' for a multitude of reasons . 
  by whom ? 
  i would expect most people to feel the same way , which in turn makes me wonder why nothing is being done to address this issue . 
  then i remember how distant the ep is to its voters , and how the commission is a joke in terms of democratic accountability , so i really do n't know who 's going to advance reforms . 
  my money 's still on the ep , but a reform can only be done through the mainstream parties . 
  those parties that are now staunchly anti-immigration are also anti-eu , and i wish to never see the day they rise up to power . 
  my country is not exactly an immigration hot spot ( because it does n't have much to offer ) , i think an insignificant amount of the populace is made up of foreigners - and most come from europe anyway . 
  however , i 've studied , worked and lived elsewhere in the eu , and the further west you go , the more it seems like something has gone out of control . 
  what i see is that many non-skilled immigrants generally do n't end up feeling very `` european '' , while the skilled ones are often attracted by the better prospects and often higher pay across the atlantic . 
  one of the most popular public figures in romania is a palestinian doctor who turned our emergency system into a highly trusted public institution - i want more people like him , here and elsewhere , and a `` skilled workers welcome '' programme would always get my vote . 
  something needs to be done about how easily the others acquire residence and citizenship , save for humanitarian and family-reunification cases . 
  you mention canada , but canada has always been an `` immigrant country '' by definition ( much like the us or australia ) , which makes it even worse that the eu 's current take on immigration is more relaxed . 
  the eu can create its own tailor-made policy . 
  i just do n't see any momentum in that direction . 
  have you even read the article ? 
  `` the text that diplomats are negotiating now would allow european forces to inspect and seize the vessel of a person suspected of smuggling without necessarily awaiting the permission of the vessel 's flag state . 
  ** the people on the vessel would be taken to european shores ** , diplomats said , ** so they could apply for political asylum ** . '',
