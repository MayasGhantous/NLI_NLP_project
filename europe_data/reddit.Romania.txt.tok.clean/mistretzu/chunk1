kaczynski that guy better have some tactical nukes in his sleeve to back up those chunky balls . . 
  so you want to give us a good head start ? 
   fine for me . 
  sure ... [ here is one ] ( http://catholicphilly.com/2013/06/us-world-news/national-catholic-news/west-virginia-priest-sides-with-miners-in-coal-companys-bankruptcy/ ) can i see the preview now ? 
  can we have a sneak preview ? 
  warning : if you do n't speak russian , you will not understand much of the conversation in this video and there is no translation available . 
  so why is n't this on the front page yet ? 
  do n't worry much about the language . 
  we do n't beat foreign speaking people in romania ( not even hungarians ) like they do in . . never mind . 
  well , these priests know their shit . 
  the book of apocalypse says it clear : the next big catastrophe will be a rain of fire and not flooding like the last time . . 
  those bunkers are there just in case that [ heretic kirill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriarch_kirill_of_moscow ) decides to nuke our beloved [ patriarch daniel ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriarhul_daniel ) when god is busy collecting some bribes elsewhere . . 
  word !, 
   man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest . 
  do n't waste your time waiting for that car to happen . . 
  and which are the songs played by the [ short women with rich titties and round ass ] ( https://youtu.be/yicjuni1gc0?t=52 ) ? 
  the minimum wage workers are either middle aged/old people who own their home since communist days ( [ home ownership in the entire eastern europe is quite high ] ( http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/06/is-a-high-home-ownership-rate-a-sign-of-a-successful-country.html ) ) , or they commute from villages or cheaper suburbs or they are young people still living with the parents or renting in groups . 
  if you do n't have to pay rent maybe/kind of yes ( for example if you are young and you live with your parents , without much obligations ) . 
  if you are having a family or you are alone and you have to pay a rent of 150-200 eur/month . . ( typical rent outside big cities ) the things get very tight . . 
  you know nothing about your culture my friend ... watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjmce4qibkc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyz7_edrjm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=somob-d7ofa obviously i 'm kidding . . but i love these songs, 
  i was just kidding . .  but still outside bucharest 500 eur is not easily gained by new grads . . 
  dude , do n't mock our `` nouveau riche '' ... 
  do you know the name of the song ( or a link ) ? 
  thanks edit : actually i found one version \u0421\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0437\u0430 - \u041d\u043e\u0447\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c but it 's available only on spotify, 
  well , it 's intended to fuck up everything in its way ... so it must be a male . . 
  it bounced in his anus . . edit : no i insist , [ gaddafi was killed by a bayonet in the ass . . ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/gaddafi-killed-bayonet-stab-anus-libya-395224 ), 
  the people are cooperative and trusting . . but the politicians are old snakes . . it 's very hard for them to give up the national pie for the federal one . 
  well , i will not hide you the fact that i hope you will all get screwed  . 
  i really do n't see how they can repay all those money without incurring oversized costs ( someone has to identify all the donors and initiate transfers . . ) and the last thing i can imagine is the state spending money to repay you . 
  the easiest way out would be to transfer those funds to the ministry of culture budget for art . 
  as a high ranking official in the french gov , i think sarkozy had knowledge about many events and geopolitical shifts that were about to occur therefore he probably only tried to monetize some of that insight . 
  and probably he was not the first to use the trick . 
  there was a rumor that the same scheme was applied to ceausescu who was asked in his last years to sponsor mitterand 's party as payback for some contracts with french technology which were never to materialize . 
  i do n't know how true it is . 
  where does the money go if they do n't add up to the required sum ? 
  500 ron ? 
  less than a two way ticket to paris ? 
  that 's what you call love for art ? 
   you are generalizing . 
  good . 
  let 's agree then that both of us are generalizing in different extremes and it 's fine for me . 
  and btw , if you love the art , how much have you donated for this sculpture ? 
   in the meantime , romanian citizens still spend their money in paris to look at art . 
  lol on one hand i ca n't contradict you . . on the other hand , your observation is hilarious because in the 10 years i 've been living in paris i have seen & heard romanians ( from thieves to honorable citizens ) everywhere except in museums . 
  with one notable exception : there was a group of middle aged romanian tourists ( men & women freshly descended from a bus ) visiting the brancusi workshop near centre pompidou . 
  the problem is , while watching those famous works of art ( `` worth billions '' according to some ) , they were talking some stupid banalities and what struck me the most : they were  50 % ** dressed in sports wear ** . 
  also i think an it system for health management is no doubt greater value for the entire romanian society than 20kg of rock to be watched by some snobs in bucharest , even if both of them were overpaid and acquired through corruption . 
  well , if that 's all you can bring . . 
  i take it . 
  good boy !, 
  now go fetch me another error . . ( i bet you were schooled in romania ), 
  their sentiments are obviously conditioned by the immediate gains and they still question why the prejudice . . / jk, 
  the sad fact is that 100 euro is the maximum price i would pay for that sculpture . . not even that . 
  this `` state has to pay millions for art because . . '' is a scam . 
  99.9 % of the romanians had no idea that sculpture existed before and will probably continue to not know anything about the rest of brancusi 's works . 
  why are they supposed to pay generously for something so ** completely irrelevant to their lives ** . 
  in the same newspaper with articles about this sculpture there is an article about how [ 2 out of 10 romanians believe the sun rotates around the earth and 1 out of 10 does n't know ] ( http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/2-din-10-romani-cred-ca-soarele-se-invarte-in-jurul-pamantului-iar-al-treilea-nu-stie-solutia-ministerului-educatiei.html ) . 
  the country pays for churches , megachurches and museums while the population is dumb as a rock because the education is extremely underpaid . 
  tldr ; ** those who can appreciate artistically that sculpture should gather 11 millions of euro for it and donate it to the state museum or do whatever they want with it . 
  the state should not pay for something of such low utility to the vast majority of its citizens ** edit : wow , sorry to the freeloading art lovers . . 
  i did n't want to hurt your feelings , i just wanted you to take financial responsibility for your expensive hobby . 
  no need to downvote . 
  and what is the official argument against rep. srpska 's independence ? 
  what makes it different than kosovo ? 
  we have definitive proof it was putin himself who ordered this . 
  he confessed to this on russia today right after he had revendicated the downing of the malaysia airliner and the attack on pearl harbor . 
  yeah , i know , it 's crazy what you hear once putin starts confessing . . 
  that 's some top notch subversion you did there . . , 
  carefully avoided by the romanian tourists with kids . . 
  e in regula . 
  whoa , whoa , easy there with the medals when the race has barely begun , or you want to pull another `` obama nobel prize for peace '', 
   the duster is a good car ** for the money ** imo very important, 
  you want to be rich too ? 
  just borrow these loaves of bread from the imf and be paying a decade for it . . you will feel so rich when you finish paying . 
  and what are the gains ? 
   the last thing anyone needs is advice from ~ ~ romania ~ ~ anarchisto . 
  ftfy if you want to know romania 's position on this . . check the official website of the government not some dumb dude on the internets . 
  chill , he 's only teasing you . . 
  not really . 
  not all the nations are so ethno centric and nationalist . 
  putting transylvania aside because it 's under romanian rule for less than 100 years and it 's still a `` sensible subject '' , but if we look at [ dobrudja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobruja ) , a region with turks , tatars , russians/lipovans/ukrainians and some bulgars , under almost continuous and uncontested romanian rule since 1879 and you can still see people who preserved their names , languages , churches/mosques and so on . 
  all that was asked from them was to be loyal to the romanian state and the state had no incentive to start a conflict with its citizens due to forced assimilation . 
  also how can you explain that the armenians from southern & eastern romania ( [ vosganian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varujan_vosganian ) , [ pambuccian ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/varujan_pambuccian ) ) kept their names and religion , while those from transilvania were almost completely assimilated by hungarians ? 
   at first , they settled in the crimean peninsula , but there they were threatened by the tatars . 
  reaching the carpathians , they settled in moldova . 
  for 200 years , they lived in moldova , suchava , botoshan , and yash , where there were still communities that had not yet merged with moldovans . 
  however , these communities were not favorable for armenians either , especially in the 17th century , when the prince declared that all of the local people were moldovans and that they had to speak romanian . 
  the armenians did not accept the order , and some of them went up the carpathians , where they stayed until moving to transylvania during the reign of prince apafi in 1672 . 
  strange logic on these armenians . 
  first they went to crimea where they were `` not welcomed '' ( as in `` persecutions/killings '' ) by the tatars , then they lived for 200 years among the orthodox romanians/moldovans but they refused to learn the damned language and moved to transilvania where the hungarians forced them not only to give up their native language but also their native religion ( ~ orthodoxy ) . 
  i guess moving to transilvania was `` so much better '' , right ? 
  interesting , big dogs are probably overkill now if you do n't have bears in uk, 
  what guns ??? 
  watch this [ action romanian stylee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlbjarmtffg ) !, 
  of course !, 
  our dacia ( n ) s had wheels right from the beginning . . 
   they 're playing their classic good cop bad cop routine . 
  very plausible . 
  i do n't think anyone here knows exactly what are the ** actual ** motives behind the dutch veto but iirc there were multiple and rather credible rumors in romania that dutch investors tried to buy the constanta seaport since long time but were refused . 
  also constanta is valuable even without any other infrastructure like roads and railroads because it 's connected to the [ danube-blacksea channel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube%e2%80%93black_sea_canal ) which offers a very cheap and navigable road up to south-eastern germany , therefore covering a lot of the central and south-eastern european economic area .
