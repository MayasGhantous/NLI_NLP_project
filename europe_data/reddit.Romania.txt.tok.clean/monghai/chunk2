  that 's a bit like asking us which stereotypes we think are true in our experience . 
  i doubt most people have met enough bulgatians or have been to bulgaria enough to have actually formed an informed opinion on the matter . 
   glorious country [ indeed .

  that 's a bit weird considering we joined over 6 years before you guys did . 
  this is n't really evidence of anything . 
  i 'm quite certain that what the state department said is indeed true , but they 've offered nothing to back it up . 
  they said the ukrainians captured one of the russian militants . 
  post a video confession then , at least that would be worth something . 
  what do the bridges look like now ? 
  this is just hogwash . 
  the only thing ponta is kind of good at is pr , and this is nothing but another stunt to help him in the polls . 
  what i do n't doubt is that he 's actually going to fool a lot of people with these kinds of articles . 
  he 's been working on his image lately to make himself seem more progressive , more supportive of the new generations and less of the old and corrupt . 
  he recently appointed a 34 year old lecturer in economics at the university of maryland as minister of finance . 
  the issue here is that while she may know tons about her field , that wo n't really help her untangle the bureaucratic catastrophe that is the romanian financial system . 
  but it sure makes him look progressive , does n't it ? 
  i do n't get it either, 
  i still do n't understand . 
  what the eff are you on about ? 
  how do you register ? 
   it 's a quick and precise prompt . 
  much like a slide on a slideshow . 
  i 'd much rather have a full slideshow , than a single slide . 
  if you want to post something on someones opinion , that 's great , a lot of the people here do that . 
  just do n't trim it down or editorialize it . 
  stuff like that damages quality and influences the way people think . 
  for example , you could 've just posted the source in which kurkov said that . 
  you did n't need to add a pretty picture of him and post the whole thing on imgur . 
   the culture of this sub redding [ sic ] favours in depth posts , i do n't think we need to worry about photos like this overwhelming r/europe . 
  i 'm not saying posts like these are going to overwhelm r/europe , i 'm wondering if they should be allowed at all . 
  they 're low effort , and a lot of other subreddits have already banned them . 
  meta : should these kind of posts really be allowed on / r/europe ? 
  i understand the easiest way of devouring content is through tiny pictures accompanied by text that can be read in under 10 seconds , but low effort posts turn good subreddits into poop . 
  the quality of the content here is pretty good and i 'd like it to stay that way . 
  posts like these do n't really encourage conversation , nor serious thought . 
  a quote can be easily submitted as a self post , without the need of a fancy picture . 
  not to mention that you can add a lot more context into a self post for those who do n't really know what you 're on about . 
  i 'd like to know what the mods ' take on this one is . 
   itt : people claiming the uk is obsessed by empire and is irrelevant . 
  3 out of 69 comments mention the word empire , and another 4 discuss it . 
  pretty sure it 's not that bad . 
  [ english people do . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muntenia ), 
  probably just trolling . 
  i do n't get why you 're being downvoted . 
  it 's actually a pretty cool subreddit . 
  / r/europeanculture, 
   the ukraine economy is very very good . 
  it 's kind of the opposite . 
  while per capita gdp has been rising , a huge percentage of ukraine 's economy lies in the black market ( it 's estimated it 's around [ 40 ] ( https://www3.mruni.eu/ojs/business-systems-and-economics/article/view/1474/1420 ) - [ 60 ] ( http://images.businessweek.com/ss/10/07/0729_worlds_biggest_shadow_economy/7.htm ) % ) . 
  what this means is that although on paper the country should be doing better each year , it 's actually doing worse as more money is being transferred into the shadow economy . 
  you 've probably heard about the recent 15 billion euro russian bailout of ukraine which they needed to pay their debts . 
  if their economy was doing well they would n't have needed a bailout worth almost 10 % of their gdp . 
  this is actually a major point and i suggest you look further into it ( if you 're interested ) . 
   russia is the better option for the country . 
  this is highly debatable and opinions differ from person to person . 
  in the short term , i agree that russia would be a better option economically . 
  they 're already the largest ( if i 'm not mistaken ) trading partner of ukraine and joining the customs union would definitely ease trade with the ex-soviet states . 
  the big issue here is that russia has a tendency to screw over its trading partners quite badly ( for a recent example , see the hijacking of armenia 's state oil company ) . 
  on the other hand , russia is an [ incredibly corrupt country ] ( http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/ ) . 
  here lies one of the major issues in associating with them . 
  many ukrainians see the political systems of western and central europe as serving the general population , as opposed to putin 's russia which serves the political class . 
  i 'm not trying to say that they 're right or wrong , i 'm just trying to explain their point of view . 
  there 's massive corruption in the eu as well ( italy , greece , romania , etc. 
  ) , but things are steadily improving in at least some countries . 
  romania 's justice system has started working magnificently in the past couple of years , with about two dozen corrupt politicians ( including an old prime minister ) serving jail sentences . 
  one of the main reasons the justice system started working in romania is because the eu forced the political class to make it work . 
  the general population had no power to make it work . 
  whoever we voted for , we got the same pieces of corrupt garbage . 
  ukraine has been in the same situation for the past 20 + years and there 's no end to it in sight . 
  without the eu forcing them to clean up their political class , there 's no incentive in the system to do it , and the people are just as powerless to change the situation through voting as the people of romania were . 
  this is why they 've taken to the streets . 
  the people were promised an association agreement with the eu and this gave many the hope that things would start looking better . 
  the refusal of yanukovich to sign it only sparked the protests , but they eventually turned into something a lot more fundamental . 
  people are protesting against the incredibly corrupt ukrainian establishment and the direction they 're taking the country in . 
   do these people just hate russia ? 
  is that still justified ? 
  i hope i 've mostly answered this above , but just to reiterate . 
  they do n't just hate russia . 
  although the protesters are n't homogeneous in their opinions , most of them see russia as a bad influence . 
  they believe that associating with russia would only aggravate the problems caused by the crooks they call politicians . 
  ** edit : i hope i gave you a bit of insight into the protests . 
  i wo n't be able to reply for a while so debating anything is a bit hard . 
  if you want a bit more info on ukraine 's economy i suggest you do some google searches on the economical devide between east and west , on their gas dependence on russia , on their budget deficit , and on the effects of their joining the wto . 
  bit extreme , but i do n't blame you . 
   just easy to get to and shit post .

   how the fuck are you measuring this ? 
  http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/ edit : i posted the link before commenting anything ( my bad , really tired ) . 
  the cpi for 2013 puts romania and italy at the same level of corruption . 
  obviously , it 's not objective , but at least it gives an idea . 
  i googled slav squat to give a good example of what it is to folks that might not know . 
  [ apparently this exists . 
  it 's a great platform . 
  i 've used it previously for two other courses and they were both well made and quite interesting . 
  i highly recommend it . 
  yup . 
  just criminals . 
  he might actually be right considering 2 or 3 million romanians have already left the country since we joined the eu .
