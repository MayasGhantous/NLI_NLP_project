my post can easily be read as very arrogant . 
  the lack of body-language and tone in on-line communication makes things worse . 
  it is difficult to predict people 's reactions when you know almost nothing about those who will read what you write . 
  do n't worry it does n't look arrogant . 
  it looks patronizing . 
   i 'm joking , but i get you point . 
  reasonable and balanced opinion . 
  gets downvoted to hell . 
  because we have a crazy neighbor who sometimes likes to drink and beat his wife . 
   i think most people would think not allowing is fighters back into the country is simply common sense yes 100 % true . 
  but since you ca n't prove what were people doing in syria or iraq you ca n't deny them access back in the country just based on the fact that you might think they 're terrorist . 
  i 'm sure the secret service are monitoring people who went to syria and came back , farage is just scare mongering so he can get votes from the uninformed . 
  seriously . 
  it 's not john 's oliver 's opinion . 
  he presents facts, 
  great argument, 
  there is no racial discrimination in ferguson .

  god you 're thick edit : thanks / u/modomario, 
  not yet, 
  this was a peaceful protest . 
  people are trying to raise awareness of the genocide those medieval backward animals are doing in syria and iraq, 
  solid logic, 
  alright , moving on, 
  do n't know if you 've seen these documentary series [ the brits who built the modern world ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vgz7r/episodes/guide ) . 
  very interesting, 
  lovely . 
  we only visited cardif and we meat with a guy who showed us around.it was incredibly windy on that time of the year , but other than that it was nice . 
  btw the architect ( norman foster ) that is doing the towers also did the millau viaduct .

  my then girlfriend 's parents drove the car back , and i hung around for a few more days and then took a plane back . 
  the path of benefit seekers from romania debunked by daily mail edit : word,

  or a fat praying mantis . 
  head east-austria , wings poland and claws croatia, 
  plan on turning it all blue before i turn 30 http://imgur.com/uj35gze, 
  so why are pointing out usa 's faults ? 
  what 's to gain from that ? 
  that 's an ad hominem response edit : words, 
  i do n't get you people . 
  why do you feel the need to stand up for a fucking wacko ( erdogan ) ex prime minister and now president who is trying to transform turkey into an islamic state just because hes from you country . 
  instead of trying to point out the flaws in another country you should just say than yeah situation is not very good but we 're working on it . 
  and some really really love it, 
  i did not watch that clip for the cave, 
  thing is this fucker was more like berlusconi than murdon . 
  he has his media empire which he uses for political purposes edit : words, 
  bring out the champaign people . 
  that roof looks like it 's floating . 
  beautiful, 
  that is why i did n't said anything about the article . 
  only about op, 
   i 'm not taking anything away from the article . 
  as in i 'm not disregarding the article . 
  yes , good that the imam got expelled for preaching hatred speech . 
  my comment was slightly of topic i guess but i was just point out that maybe op is posting the article just to incite people . 
  there has been a lot raiding from stormfront or 4chan or wherever they come from . 
  that 's the only reason i 've pointed out op submission history . 
  like i said i 'm not taking anything away from the article . 
  i 'm not taking anything away from the article . 
  i 'm just pointing out that op might have other reasons for posting this article than just spreading information . 
  remember that article yesterday were every dumb racist and xenophobic comment got gold ? 
  because he 's a racist who only post stuff like this to incite people . 
  http://www.reddit.com/user/kinzkopf/submitted/ op 's submission history . 
  yes edit : ^ ^ ^ ^ blaaaaaaaa, 
  neither of you guys are right . 
  it 's * they 're * bec it 's short for *** they are *** not * their * or * thei ` r * . 
  anyway , that 's how i remember the correct form, 
  go back to stormefront or 4chan or wherever the fuck you came from, 
   are you guys seeing these riots on your news in france ? 
  no because it 's old . 
  but you can post it to / r/europeans so the nice guys over there can circlejerk around how muslims are taking over europe, 
  alright who did [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/qraveqx ) ? 
  kate 's sister, 
  we like you almost as much as germany from what i know, 
  i used to watch him with my family on sundays when i was a kid . 
  fun times, 
  the only neighbor we like is the black sea . 
  i 'm sure relatives are social media sites looking at pictures from the crash . 
  someone probably recognised someone . 
  which would be horrible, 
  hope you never have to go through what does family members are going through but i 'm note sure you would like to see your dead loved one on social media . 
  they should have at least blurred the image . 
  295 edit : more that 300 now bbc says . 
  it 's true . 
  they probably did n't spent more that 13 billions on the actual olympics . 
  but 50 billions were spent in total . 
  then there 's a problem . 
  either the politicians do n't represent there public view or the minority has a louder voice than the majority, 
  you can send some migrants to romania . 
  we 'll be down to 0 people soon, 
  is that putin in that picture next to him ? 
  kinda looks like putin edit : thanks, 
  / u/jewish _ neocon2 i 'd like to meet someone like him so i can hear his arguments . 
  cause i ca n't for the life of me understand how someone can think like that, 
  so that 's where / u/ramblinrambo and that neo nazi guy went . 
  that is what we call a blitzkrieg edit : oh man . 
  thank god for that goal . 
  i do n't think brazilians could have handled not scoring at least one goal edit2 : did we just watch 90 minutes of rape ? 
   he was banned for having unpopular opinions outside of / r/europe [ 1 ] , really ?
