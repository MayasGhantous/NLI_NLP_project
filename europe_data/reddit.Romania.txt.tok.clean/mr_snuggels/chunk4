  case in point , there are a lot who integrated . 
  and also . 
  if your parents migrated from another country in lets say romania , then if you are born in romania you are romanian , simple as that . 
  roma people are here for much longer than one generation so they are as romanian as they get . 
  i kinda get your point of view but further marginalizing them does n't help anyone , not us nor them , it just perpetuates the cycle of hatred towards one another . 
  even though it does n't look like it . 
  there are a lot of social programs across europe that work and have shown to give positive results regarding integration . 
  we just need a bit a more patience and more funding . 
   statistics predict that by 2050 the gypsy population in romania will equal the romanian population . 
  i knew that by 2050 the youngest population of romania will be roma . 
  the young kids of today will grow up into a working force . 
  but we need to get them in schools so that they can grow up into functioning adults . 
  otherwise we 'll just find ourselves with another couple million out of job , uneducated people living on benefits and stealing . 
  i know of a social program in baia mare which offers roma children the chance to study and it 's been working very well so far . 
  i 'm sure there are similar programs across the country . 
   wow , you 're seriously comparing deporting illegal migrants back to the country of their birth they are not illegal . 
  like it or not they are eu citizens, 
  well now i know why there are no more beggars over here, 
  for some reason i see you as relatively poor blonde and redheaded people, 
  inb4 stereotypes, 
   we just sheltered them for a few decades . 
  look at you , you little sheltering altruistic person you . 
  actually we kept them as slaves . 
  but you keep telling yourself that we sheltered them so you can justify your racism . 
  so the swedes are naive and the greeks are paranoic, 
  someone 's grumpy today, 
  or visit ukraine, 
  well cause i like iranians and i 'm not gon na change my opinion because of one guy edit : words, 
  well that 's cause they are misinformed, 
  well if it helps i do n't hate iranians . 
  love the culture and the people, 
  yeah i 've recognized a girl in one picture she 's a colleague and she 's definitely form cluj . 
  code name for less poor and brown people, 
  it looks like a bride at a football match, 
  can we do this on a weekly basis ? 
  i 'd love to see ordinary photos from other countries , we could call it weekly photo album or something like that and everybody would post a photo or an album of photos from their country . 
  nobody 's perfect, 
  shitty comment, 
  take your racist shit comment the fuck away from here . 
  so in your mind all the poor people are gypsies ? 
  so is op a bundle of sticks in this chase ? 
  yes , yes he is edit : words, 
  piggybacking your comment . 
  the symbol monkey tale = coada de maimuta but i have n't heard somebody in a long time use it we use arond or at . 
  edit : words, 
  if you limit your knowledge on just what you 've learned in school then you 're gon na realize that you do n't know shit about anything, 
  i think you 're trying to argue with a guy that just wants to stir shit up, 
  ** we used ** to write in cyrillic . 
  i like how you base your entire argument just on the fact that bucharest used to be called little paris . 
  i agree with you they are not canadians per se . 
  it 's just a faceless corporation looking for a profit, 
  of topic : eussr actually makes sense with this color, 
   they think weed is of the devil . 
  uneducated and misinformed people yes . 
  but i feel it 's more or less the same in other countries . 
  we just have a lot more of them . 
  if we would n't allow people over 50 to vote on this issue , marijuana would probably be legal in romania, 
  what 's so bad in that by the way ? 
  to live like the west we do n't have to be the west . 
  we have our own thing going on here in eastern europe . 
   it 's hard for anyone else to take us seriously when even the romanians themselves are full of shit . 
  yeah exactly . 
  stop that . 
  in your opinion is easier to bullshit ourselves that we live in a fantasy romania rather than owning to the truth and try to make it better . 
   you cut the rest of my message . 
  that 's not very nice . 
  what ? 
  i do n't think you know how this works . 
  i was quoting you so that you 'd know exactly what part of your message i 'm addressing i did n't take something out of context . 
  you ca n't take something out of context when the rest of the message is literally 2 cm above . 
   that 's what i said , except the `` almost exclusively '' part . 
  sorry , but no . 
  yes . 
  except that you said in villages , horses are ** sometimes ** used by farmers to transport stuff like corn . 
  nothing more than that . 
  people who live in the countryside in romania and own a horse or two use it almost exclusively as a work animal ( which is not something bad ) . 
   sometimes implies that most of the time the animal is used for something other than work . 
  which is not true, 
   you are lying and full of shit , especially judging by your name . 
  you can only see gypsies in cities occasionally bullshit . 
  there are entire villages that have almost exclusively roma population . 
   in villages , horses are sometimes used by farmers to transport stuff like corn . 
  nothing more than that . 
  in villages horses are used almost exclusively as work animals . 
  from means of transportation , plowing the field and carrying goods . 
  it 's true that most of the people living in villages are old or older and romania progressed without them but a significant part of the population is rural . 
  edit : words, 
  what ? 
  are you trying to hypnotize me ? 
  [ -38 ] and i did n't just mindlessly downvoted him . 
  it 's incredible how i ca disagree with someone so bad, 
  at least people are not wondering why you 're poor, 
  that 's pretty impossible . 
  i see your posts everywhere from / r/europe / r/worldnews / r/formula1 and many others . 
  yeah i know this guy . 
  i had him tagged fucktard for some reason . 
  at first i thought he was a troll but after scrolling through his posts and blog i think he 's just mental , which is quite sad actually edit : word, 
  that 's cause if you would try to apologise you 'd be doing nothing but apologising . 
   this kind of situation is what makes me have a bad opinion of people here . 
  as you probably know reddit sometimes is a popularity contest .
