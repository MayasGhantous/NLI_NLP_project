  it looks like it 's been a long day for you . 
  the number of brits that act in this manner is probably very small . . but the number of those that share the feeling i 'm not so sure if it 's that small . 
  and they have lots of ways less extreme of making life crap for the `` scary culture destroying job stealing infrustructer pression puting '' foreigner, 
  it 's 100 % a murder attempt . 
  it 's a knife to the freaking neck we 're talking about .

  is n't that the also true about romania ? 
  i feel it 's the same when it comes to ro, 
  just googled the place ... damn !, 
  i guess that 's the kind of place you need to know exists . 
  would those pseudo insults be ok then ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpnrtjboisg this could be of some help, 
  this depicts with 100 % accuracy my exact feelings on the matter . 
  funny how ?

  kinda cool . 
  tnx, 
  quite a precises amount for a made up tax . 
  mad trolling skills . 
  `` former chairman of the food standards agency ca n't handle a joke and gets outraged '' - would be a better article title,

  well if you are eastern european simpleton that wants to have sex that 's what you have to do . 
  lots of people derive their self worth from the `` nice '' things they have . 
  what strategies do finish simpletons use for procuring sex ? 
  i did n't say i was for or against brexit . 
  i was only commenting on the way the discussion on it `` happend '' . 
  plus my opinion on it does n't really mater since i 'm not british . 
  for disclosure 's sake i did n't like the idea of brexit so you could argue i 'm projecting my disappointment with the result on the way it has been debated . 
  brexit aside , i do believe that political debate has moved away from facts and is now solely based on feelings and nothing more . 
  perhaps it had always been like this and i only now noticed it ... 
  glad to here the issue is being addressed . 
  probably fixed just about the time of the actual brexit \u00af \\ ( \u00b0 _ o ) / \u00af, 
  as an european citizen , ca n't the locals get the job through the same intermediate company as the east-eu people ? 
  ( ex : get hired by a polish company to work in the uk ) 2 . 
  ca n't this be easily fixed by introducing a law that demands a minimum wage for anyone working in the uk no mater the origin of the company that gets the contract ? 
  do n't really think that the eu wold be against that . 
  i absolutely love this kind of stuff . 
  tnx, 
  what happened was n't a discussion . 
  no one was interested in actually understanding the issues . 
  the two sides came up with tweet-size arguments followed up by tweet-size counter arguments and the people chose the ones that were more in tune with their feelings . 
  it had nothing to do with what was correct or true , nothing to do with logic or facts but had everything to do with emotions , feelings , fears and hopes . 
  ( in marketing theory and practice feelings rather then facts work a lot better ) . 
  for almost 5 years the uk had this ... thing ... , this marketing twitter war filed with slogans , `` news '' article titles ( no one has time for the actual content of the article , especially if you get them through your echo-chamber facebook feed ) and catchphrases designed to hammer down on those feelings . 
  by the time of the referendum you could predict with 100 % accuracy what arguments each side wold present on every topic related to brexit that came up on the `` debates '' . 
  5 years and the discussion never took place . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone would think an actual border wold be a smart thing to do . 
  no one in their right mind would let that happen . 
  there going to find a way not to end up with that, 
  no hate . 
  but i kinda feel sad and depressed . 
  this was totally not a thing we needed and i 'm scared silly about france 's next move as an eu core . 
  i do n't know if people realize how important the western europe has been to eastern europe as a role model , as a living example of democracy at work and how `` it gets people together working for a better future '', 
  emm ... free movement ... it 's actually optional to live in your own country, 
  whatever is decided at the referendum , one thing 's clear to me . 
  about half of the uk citizens will be sad and disappointed ( angry ? ), 
  i know referendums are super democratic and stuff , but having on on a topic of this magnitude when there is no overwhelming support for one side is not healthy for a society . 
  if size matters in this kind of things , i fail to see how the fifth largest economy would get a better deal then the largest economy in the world ( eu ) . 
  it would be an nobrainer to leave if the world outside the eu worked on free trade , but it dose n't , i believe most of the world dose business wto style or are part of trading blocks ( ex . 
  like it or not if a economy is sufficiently large and divers and if it has access to raw resources protectionism dose work . 
  the reason why european nations are in some sort of club with favorable trade agreements with each other is because they chooses so . 
  they have sacrificed some of that all so precious sovereignty and are in that said club . 
  i 'm not saying something new to you , and nor are you to me . 
  about now we probably hard most off the arguments on the subject . 
  gl with everything . 
  is getting a better deal then ttip with the usa easier to achieve outside the eu ? 
  dose the uk have a better position , more to bargain with after the brexit ? 
  ( i 'm not even sure that the usa wold want new trade deals . 
  from what i 've seen the political trend in the usa is not favorable to such things ), 
  i saw the exact same `` lady on bbc '' and i wonder how did the eu stop here from trading with brazil under the world trade organization framework ? 
  so basically she was complaining that the eu did n't have a trade deal with brazil and that tariffs under wto made it so that she could not land a contract with the brazilian customer ... from my perspective the brexit move comes down to sacrificing the uk 's trade position in europe so that it get 's a chance at trade deals with the rest of the world . 
  ( to be honest i 'm not convinced that 's a great plan . 
  maybe an extremely good and fast trade deal with india wold do the trick . 
  canada and japan ... not impressed ), 
  i 'm not all that informed on this . . but how exactly dose eu membership stop a country from trading with `` the rest of the world '' ?? 
  i genuinely want to know . 
  ( mah first reddit comment ... yup ), 
  damn . . french people really know how to throw an insult . 
  well played !, 
  hdr sucks !!, 
  no more please, 
  heartbreakingly sad, 
  i think that 's because of really low industrial energy consumption . 
  romanian industry is still under developed . 
  this `` i voted for x but now that y won and see how x responded i 've switched to y '' trick is getting a bit old . . 
  w t f ? 
  this person seems tragically desperate for power . 
  can anyone explain why she needs it so bad ? 
  ... sad !, 
  we need to get through this 4 years ... do n't loose hope ... do n't confuse trump with the whole usa ... republicans are kinda shitty but they 're not crazy . 
  let 's see the power struggle between trump and the republican establishment pan out first . 
  if agent orange looks to be in control then we should start worrying . 
  nice color scheme ` brah !,
