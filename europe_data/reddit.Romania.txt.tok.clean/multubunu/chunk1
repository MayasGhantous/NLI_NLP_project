not really , the right is fragmented , but macovei , udrea and some of t\u0103riceanu 's voters are likely to vote with johannis in the second round . 
  it is in fact better than i expected . 
  i was n't aiming that high . 
  the west pedals on * democracy * , that 's how they `` save '' countries they dominate . 
  the ussr had the * popular democracy * for the same purpose . 
  right now putin has no * nominal * ideology , except a form of nationalism , quite reminiscent of fascism except the pretense it can somehow better the human race ( which nazism did claim , by means of cleansing the backward/degenerate races ) . 
   also from more early years of ottoman empire , to this day , frenk ( franc ) is commonly used term for , not for only french , but generally europeans . 
  believe it or not , i was aware of that from * 1001 nights *  i suppose it has to do with the crusades , so sort of arabic / pre-turkish . 
  an * approved * art gallery . 
  any examples of such displays including , say , gay related material ? 
  ( inb4 gay porn , no , that 's not what i 'm saying ) . 
  or art that puts putin in a bad light ? 
   maybe because it 's not actual national propaganda ? 
  i think only nazi germany had an actual [ ministry of propaganda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichs_ministry_of_public_enlightenment_and_propaganda ) . 
  i 'm not aware of any such office in the ussr ( or the us , for that matter ) . 
  so , how do you define `` actual national propaganda '' ? 
  everybody seems to think fox news is some such , although it 's really a private media group with no official links to the american govt . 
  but in a country that - unlike the us - actively censors free speech ( see gay rights or internet laws ) , whatever gets through * is * officially ( though tacitly ) sanctioned . 
  yup , `` actual national propaganda '' alright . 
  russians are n't dumb . 
  `` to speek turkish '' , means to speak gibberish . 
  but it 's really just an expression , roughly like `` it 's all greek to me '' . 
  there are other expressions where there is some disparaging involved , either a memory from before 1877 ( e.g. 
  [ bab\u0103 turceasc\u0103 ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/turcesc/836483 ) ) , or from the early nineties when cheap , low quality merchandise was imported from turkey ( e.g. 
  turkish jeans ) - but they are mostly forgotten . 
  engels , or * long beard * . 
  we did n't get mao on these and i did n't catch stalin , but my mom did , and she says the display was named : ` wide beard , long beard , pointy beard , no beard ' ( it rhymes in romanian ) . 
   dumbed down the propaganda actually , it 's more similar to cartoons of the era , but even there you would n't see stalin or hrushchev kicking eisenhower ass . 
  in cartoons it was ok ridiculing the adversary ( without involving the current own leader ) , e.g. 
   a very specific narrative needs to be pounded into people 's heads yup , cartoons alright . 
  quite interestingly , putin 's attempt at empire lacks the necessary ideology , so it 's all about him . 
   neither did they target an american leader . 
  in propaganda posters no , or at least i could n't find an explicit one . 
  that 's true from the other direction as well , as both sides villified the other 's * system * , and the message would be diluted by tying it to one man . 
  however , [ hitler was depicted explicitly ] ( http://home.comcast.net/~whslibrary/gauntt/1812_1941_jk.jpg ) , that 's why i said * occasionally * . 
  not quite the same bullshit . 
  in soviet political art , while the villain is occasionally an actual political figure , the hero is symbolic , `` the people '' or such . 
  the leader of the day is normally portrayed in ambiances implying abundance or [ progress ] ( http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2502/3941717578_84949f8bb2.jpg ) , and mostly as a [ god-like ] ( http://smartmuseum.uchicago.edu/exhibitions/assets/klutsis_glory.jpg ) ( [ another example ] ( http://www.eddiessovietposters.com/sovietposters/prodmag2/soviet/leninstalinarmysovietposter-3.jpg ) ) , [ protector figure ] ( http://cdnimg.visualizeus.com/thumbs/50/4e/propaganda,soviet,ussr-504e84cc850e7173383c9353274f394a_h.jpg ) , but never as a direct combatant . 
  what we see there is exaggerated even by soviet standards . 
  that 's because back in the '80s all lemon juice on the market came in yellow plastic bottles labelled helas , presumably imported from greece . 
  ca n't find any picks , though . 
  compare with spanish [ * polla * ] ( https://translate.google.com/#es/en/polla ) . 
  * pula * originates in the [ latin word for chicken ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pullus#latin ) ( sp . 
  pollo , fr . 
  poule ) , but the metaphoric meaning diverged at some point from the literal , which gave * pui * ( chicken in romanian ) , a process probably similar to the spanish * polla * - * pollo * . 
  both meanings have still the same form in greek , [ * \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%cf%80%ce%bf%cf%85%ce%bb%ce%af#greek ) . 
   so we are screwed no matter what the government does . 
  go tell that to the ukrainians . 
  also , the procedure is probably not for rheumatism but for back pain ( see my anecdote [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2j424x/romania_1946_a_roma_tries_to_cure_rheumatism_with/cl8ecky ) ) . 
  most likely , it 's not for rheumatism , but rather a form of chiropracture for a bad back . 
  i remember some tale about having someone step on your back to cure backpain . 
  i even tried that , although i had no pain ; it 's strangely relaxing ( having someone do it to you ) . 
  more like cis 2.0 - or ussr 3.0 . 
  or indeed , russian empire 4.0 . 
  it 's misleading to deliberate over the sounds of letters from another alphabet , but cyrillic * e * as pronounced in russian sounds like * je * ( or * ye * if you will ) . 
  in romanian we indeed use the spelling erevan , which does not render the original pronunciation correctly - it should have been ierevan . 
  people tend to forget the bloody invasion of the ussr , when estonians deported half the occupied population , never to be seen again . 
  also , in dobrudja the turk/tatar are overrepresented ( they make up about 5 % of the population of dobrudja at ~ 30k ) , bulgarians should not be seen at all ( 135 people in dobrudja in 2002 ) , while [ lipovans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) are not shown at all ( 2,2 % - 21k ) . 
  russians in ne romania is simply ridiculous . 
  the russian minority in romania is almost exclusively lipovan and those live almost exclusively in dobrudja/danube delta . 
  i would have liked to see aromanians in a distinct colour , on the other hand . 
  that one is really hilarious . 
  i mean , you basically draw austria-hungary on the map , and then name it serb . 
  those cunning serb.s . 
  honest question , honest answer , my dear watson . 
  they seem to mark the cities of edinburgh , orleans , burgos , milan , bremen , ptolemaida , ~ ~ bila tserkva ~ ~ vinnytsia , and merzifon . 
  they even gave us bits of northern maramure\u0219 and bucovina . 
  not in those boundaries . 
  well , there 's a new country called * serb . 
  * including the former territories of austria , hungary , the czech republic , and slovakia . 
  it seems to have a border dispute with ukraine , who also lost some clay to romania . 
  and the long gone yugoslavia is marked bulgaria . 
  otherwise it 's an ok map , blue and pink rays and all . 
   while harghita and covasna [ ... ] are indeed among the poorest [ \\ # 23 and \\ # 25 of 42 ] ( http://old.econtext.ro/assets/620-pib%20pe%20cap%20de%20locuitor.jpg ) , hardly * among the poorest * ( 2012 pib/capita in romanian counties ) . 
   it also allows for the distinction between nationalism and patriotism . 
  can an american national be a nationalist ? 
  if your answer is * yes * , you can see what i was trying to say about the ambiguity of the term * nation * . 
  ironically accurate . 
  sarcastically , yes . 
  not directly though , as * adidas * simply meant * sports shoes * . 
   schweppes this is because in bulgaria there was some sort of convention with schweppes , and you had local production of drinks from that brand before 1990 . 
  we had the same thing with pepsi ( any black soda ) , the `` orange '' drinks were all called * cico * after a local ( industrially produced ) orange juice . 
  to blow your mind a little more : so 's [ * aragaz * ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/aragaz/829027 ) , * scoci * , and * rimel * . 
  the now obsolete * [ primus ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/primus/35348 ) * or * [ godin ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/godin/878816 ) * as well . 
   being part of poland for x years do n't mean anything at all . 
  well , it certainly does n't mean being german . 
  just to remind you what was being debated . 
   nation that term seems to be slightly different in meaning outside the anglosphere . 
  for instance , in romanian , * na\u021biune * defines a people ( * popor * ) with some sort of political consciousness , i.e. 
  besides shared culture and language there is a shared will to self determination . 
  hence the nation-state , or country . 
  you can still have countryless `` nations '' , i.e. 
  * peoples * , as long as they have some sort of manifest will to assert cultural individuality . 
  in short , a group is a nation as long as they really want to , regardless if they own - or claim - a territory exclusively . 
  the concept of * nationalism * makes a lot of sense that way . 
  in english the term nation seems to be more vague , it 's either an equivalent to ethnicity + culture , or * country * as long as it 's a nation-state . 
  belarus ? 
  you are a full crimeea closer to russia than you were six months ago . 
  ... yet . 
  do n't worry , russia is coming your way regardless .
