  the pounding of the ram on the walls eventually wakens decebal from his hangover , so he climbs the wall and scolds them : no , mentek haza , huliganok !, 
  ( in hungarian ) ( actually , most of our hungarian jokes are self deprecating ), 
  yeah , most our jokes are self deprecating . 
  here in the south there 's not a lot of jokes with hungarians either , and the ones you hear usually put them in a good light , or at least put us in a losing position , e.g. 
  : pista meets ion who is sharpening his knife . 
  i am going to kill you ! , replies ion . 
  \\ - but we 've been friends since childhood , says pista . 
  why would you do that ? 
  \\ - it 's you people that killed [ mihai viteazu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihai_viteazu ) . 
  \\ - dude , that was like 400 years ago !, 
  \\ - yeah , but i 've just learned of it . 
  actually , as absorbed as we are with our own problems , we could probably give a shout out at the weekly march for both euromaidan and the bulgarians . 
  after all , these protests have the same ultimate target , i.e. 
  corrupt politicians . 
  there 's more to it . 
  germany lost a war , and then there were the nuerenberg trials that exposed the regime and punished - at least some of - those responsible of the atrocities . 
  national socialism became , well , a four letter word . 
  the ussr just crumbled naturally , leaving russia as a bankrupt superpower with a large nuclear arsenal . 
  there was no nuerenberg equivalent , communism is still an acceptable - if suspect - stance . 
  there was no justice , no apology , no closure . 
  23 years is a long time for most . 
  a lot was forgotten , even by those who lived the times . 
  some of the nomenklatur is still in power , at least here . 
  as far as romanian attitude towards russia , i would venture to say that most here are simply weary of the big bully in the east ( that 's what russia is , international politics wise ) , not that much for holding a grudge , but rather as a result of three centuries of nudges , shoves , and kicks from that direction . 
  but we have no russian minority to speak of . 
  much of eastern europe was subject to russian colonization , and the descendants of such have the cultural memory of being first class citizens . 
  just read the top comment , you 'll understand . 
  celovek , right . 
   quantum insert it 's a [ code name ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gchq-used-quantum-insert-technique-to-set-up-fake-linkedin-pagesand-spy-on-mobile-phone-giants-8931528.html ) , the details are not public . 
  u\u0161 / u\u0161 / y\u0448 !, 
   well rome was n't multicultural all the time . 
  rome was multicultural from its very beginnings as a mixture of latins ( gave the language ) , etruscans ( gave the alphabet ) and sabines ( gave the women , apparently ) , later albans and others . 
  later on , trajan `` is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in roman history '' - he was of italic [ but non-roman origin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulpia_%28gens%29 ) . 
  if you want to claim a homogenous roman culture in between , you 'll have to account for a lot of internal turmoil , civil wars , and defeat doubling the external expansion . 
  and since we 're talking about culture , your presumed monocultural period produced mostly cheap copies of greek originals , and the catch phrase [ pecunia non olet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pecunia_non_olet ) . 
  / u/habarnam did brussels - bucharest a couple of years ago but deleted his blog posts . 
  maybe contact him directly . 
  oh  i was thinking [ galicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_%28eastern_europe%29 ) . 
  thanks . 
  interesting . 
  how do you pronounce it ? 
  we actually say something like ` jeu ' ( german j in front ) , and informally ` jo ' . 
  [ bitch , please ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-llqnkmzpjvs/tke3vil1nsi/aaaaaaaabci/peh3f6era0w/s1600/cimg0009.jpg ) , 
    i knew that as * frig\u0103nele * . 
   everybody i knew used to call it * bund\u00e1s keny\u00e9r * ( furry bread ) , including romanians perhaps you should get out more  * p\u00e2ine flocoas\u0103 * , really ? 
   popara haha , we have that too , called * papar\u0103 * , but with milk instead of tea . 
  good stuff . 
   in romania we had \u22d9 chinese nose balm \u2717 in all fairness , it was probably this rather than the vietnamese one . 
  of sorts , yes . 
  i only knew them as * frig\u0103nele * though . 
  might be a regional thing , my grandma was from foc\u0219ani . 
   paine in ou i knew that as * frig\u0103nele * . 
  you may be too young ? 
  these are seventies/eighties things . 
  i distinctly remember the vietnamese balm , and i had a triola ( the musical instrument ) , ~ ~ it may even be made in romania ~ ~ [ made in the ddr ] ( http://etimpu.com/2013/04/17/amintiri-din-copilarie-ep-29-jocuri-jucarii-partea-15/fluier-triola-din-ddr/ ) . 
  sounds much like a harmonica . 
  the rest are specifically bulgarian . 
  the romanian brand of bicycles was called pegas , there were several models , including a [ folding ] ( http://oldbicyclero.blogspot.ro/2012/11/dulapul-vechi-si-bicicleta.html ) one like op 's and [ modern ] ( http://oldbicyclero.blogspot.ro/2011/08/alegem-intre-pegas-41-si-pegas-modern.html ) , a clone of the schwinn stingray . 
  ( edit ) oh dear , how could i forget the bulgarian tahan halva , that came in tin boxes like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wq9dieb.jpg ) , my mother still keeps her threads and needles in such boxes . 
   targoviste and then bucharst actually * curtea de arge\u0219 * ( meaning the court on the arge\u0219 river ) and perhaps * c\u00e2mpulung * before t\u00e2rgovi\u0219te . 
   sulina of the 19th century ... as described in jean bart 's * europolis * , 
  ukrainian sweets , moldovan wine and now lithuanian cheese are about to see increased sales in the eu . 
  putin is a marketing genius . 
  i definitely agree with you , was just saying that systems * do * make a difference , even decades after being abolished . 
  i 'd even go further and say that the current crisis of democratic systems is generated by lack of activism which allows opportunists to replace the political class . 
  i think authoritarian legacy makes things worse . 
   systems are not the problem authoritarian systems discourage - heh - dissent , so former communist countries in eastern europe are prone to public apathy even today . 
  cyprus ? 
  dude , you have maths ... 
  let 's just say that * re * is the second greek word i 've learned , 
  * [ s-a dus pe ] apa sambetei * - * gone on the water of saturday * , about something that is irremediably broken ( fubar ) . 
  this is in relation to a pre-christian tradition where the creator got tired and some of the waters of pre-creation times remained surrounding the world , called the waters of saturday ( biblical influence ) . 
  so that object has to be so utterly destroyed that it 's just like it has never existed . 
  possibly in relation , our most common curse is * du-te-n pizda ma-tii * , sending someone to their `` origin '' ( i.e. 
  their mother 's vagina ) . 
  the expression seems [ pan balkanic ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/u_pi%c4%8dku_materinu ) . 
  while curses in english are more about some harm inflicted on the object ( * fuck you * ) , and poles/czechs peacefully denigrate ( kurwa this or that ) , this expletive sends its object right out of existence . 
  deletes it from the pages of time , so to speak . 
  i greek it 's * re * as i remember . 
  it is also a potent aphrodisiac . 
  except for the allergics :(, 
  thanks , / u/spyndax !, 
  [ here ] ( http://s017.radikal.ru/i424/1202/49/8f7b7890d77f.jpg ) 's a satirical map of europe ( from 1870 ) that [ made the rounds on reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1gw1sf/can_anyone_provide_some_historical_context_to_the/ ) ( the link at the beginning of the phrase has the better resolution ) . 
  and [ a collection ] ( http://historiana.eu/collection/satirical-maps ) of other historical/satirical maps . 
  it was a very common expression in the eighties as well . 
  the big difference is that now you may hear it on tv/radio ( think * parazitii * ) . 
  profanity somehow loses appeal as one grows older . 
  also , older people are shy of speaking in their usual idiom with the yunguns to avoid looking like the old lady with too much makeup . 
  straight from ilf & petrov . 
  ... in bucharest . 
  dude . 
  i 've spent countless hours in metropolis shops on the prog floor , spent a couple of thousand of euros on cds , ended up knowing most of the sales people there . 
  i even found one guy in the shop in pireas that spoke romanian  you guys have a strong prog community , do n't know about any bands , but the shops had plenty of records and they went really fast ( gentle giant was really hard to find , unless the shop guy would give you a tip on when the cds will be in ) . 
  well , this was many years ago ... 
  anyway , i think athens is like the capital of old school prog , no wonder vdgg had one of their first come back tour concerts there ( and i missed it by about a week , was there on a job related trip ) . 
  here 's another romanian band of the seventies you might like . 
  while phoenix above were in a jethro tull vein in their time , sfinx are more like `` good '' genesis ( keeping proportion ) . 
  [ sfinx - zalmoxe ( 1978 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc4rbpsfe4k ) . 
  not the best and quite old ( 1972 ) , just a song that i like , based on a balkanic rain-bringing ritual : [ phoenix - paparuda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oetjaccqyqs#t=327 ) . 
  the rest of the album is not bad either , i guess .
