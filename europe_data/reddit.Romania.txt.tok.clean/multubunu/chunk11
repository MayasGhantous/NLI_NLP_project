  here 's another one based off of a folk wedding song : [ nunta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt71ttr0iws ) . 
  bulgarian is a slavic language , but it does have some unique characteristics ; the only slavic language with a [ definite ] article , postfixed like in most [ balkan sprachbund ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sprachbund ) languages . 
  curios , intra in vorba . 
  dude , our protochronism precedes everybody else 's . 
   there 's like 400 billion in mortgages that they 're reporting on , but also 400 billion in saved money then why are n't the 400b saved used to pay for the 400b debt ? 
  could it be the `` saved '' money are not saved yet ? 
  if i understand your post correctly , there 's less than 400b in those savings accounts , assuming there 's only 100b saved , there 's still 300b in `` future '' money , aka debt . 
  and who will pay if for any reason people are incapable of saving ? 
  actually , and this is the mistake in the article , it 's not populist far-right that gets a boost in times of economic hardship - it 's populist parties , period . 
  in the case of romania , we have ppdd that earned 11-12 % of the votes . 
  it is certainly not populist far-right , it is populist-nil in the disparaging sense , its `` program '' fits on a postcard . 
  the romanian far-right has had a long time to discredit itself , and it 's worth to note that ppdd essentially replaces prm ( ~ 20 % in 2000 and ~ 12 % in 2004 ) , whose success was also due to populist rather than nationalist reasons . 
  2008 was at the top of a good period financially , and mindless populism lost traction . 
  also to note , it appears that such populism seems to require a charismatic top dog , a figure that while normally repugnant to the majority , may make an impression on the simpler people ( coincidentally the first victims of economic hardship ) . 
  right now , neither of them gathers any public attention anymore , and noua dreapta was never more than a bunch of thugs with no leadership to speak of . 
  the opportunist demagogue , dan diaconescu , former director and one-man-show of a tabloid tv station , was the one person available to lead a populist `` movement '' , so there you have it . 
  it is not entirely politically correct , but such ... was ... 19 ? 
  anyways , the spoof is great ( and does n't need the subtitles ) . 
  good morning , ambassador , 
  brassens * always * deserves the listen , his lyrics are simply brilliant . 
  `` more than 50 doctoral dissertations have been written about georges brassens . '', 
  ( wikipedia ) . 
  he may not be up there with villon or hugo , but he 's an accomplished poet in his own right . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.analysebrassens.com/ ? ), 
  a site with in depth analysis of all his lyrics . 
  the french language . 
  it 's incredibly expressive and flexible . 
  also the attitude . 
  they put their money where their mouths are , co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte . 
  case study : georges brassens being banned from radio france at the point he was starting to get known , for the song * le gorille * . 
  lengthy chansonette revolving around a gorilla at the zoo and the ladies giggling around the cage as the ape is incredibly well endowed . 
  but it 's not the obscenity . 
  the gorilla breaks free , and everybody runs except an old lady thinking ` that 'll be the day ' and a judge thinking he 's safe for being male . 
  but , he explains , while the ape is sexually superior to man , it does n't shine in either taste or spirit , and the song ends with a reflection on how the poor magistrate 's cries for mummy were reminiscent of the guy he had , earlier that day , condemned to death . 
  yeah , the whole thing is against the death penalty , and was banned from radio until 1955 . 
  and greece . 
  actually , nodding your head down is yes , up is no . 
  * good luck * ) is toasted more often ( and is a bit more informal ) , i was just trying to illustrate the use of * zdrav\u0103n * , 
  yeah , that 's exactly what i was trying to say . 
  romanian has a good number of slavic words , but they are often `` metaphorical '' , e.g. 
  * zdrav\u0103n * primarily means * sturdy * and only in some expressions * sane * . 
  and in some composite words * healthy * , like * \u00eenzdr\u0103veni * meaning to recover from illness , the primary slavic meaning being * healthy * , which was mostly lost . 
  we toast * s\u0103n\u0103tate !, 
  * , but not the other way around . 
   i must be easy to see it 's not ... and it 's always flattering to see foreigners taking an interest in one 's culture and up to flying the flag , no less  i did n't mean anything in an aggressive manner , just tongue-in-cheek . 
   this competition does not exist for better paid jobs yes , it does , but it 's not that visible out there . 
  ca n't speak for the netherlands , but german and american jobs were extensively outsourced to romania ( and others ) . 
  as a matter of fact , people here working in it/electronics ( and that means development/r & d ) saw their wages * increase * throughout the crisis . 
  ah , in romanian it 's not about shame , more about being healthy or like after running and such . 
  come to think of it , it 's also used for things that turn red from cooking , like pies and such . 
  ... o. . . k. . . 
  so my posts were all tongue-in-cheek , thought you were full-time romanian . 
  regardless to one 's relationship with this country , sibiu county is a place to see , it 's littered with beautiful , unusual and curious places . 
  sibiu itself is a gorgeous medieval city with cathedrals and all , museums galore , and a huge - 100ha - `` peasant tech museum '' ( astra , must see , take the tram towards rasinari ) . 
  there 's a good number of medieval fortified churches around the county , including the one in cristian - the one locality where streets are `` named '' with roman numerals - [ that 's ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=cristian,+sibiu,+romania&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=45.788534,24.031219&amp;spn=0.045187,0.104628&amp;sll=40.580585,-5.976562&amp;sspn=49.836177,107.138672&amp;oq=cristian&amp;hnear=cristian,+sibiu,+romania&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=45.78845,24.031124&amp;panoid=g5_c7jbk5l1rp_3e4prbsw&amp;cbp=12,317.37,,3,-1.19 ) `` tenth street '' , not `` street ecs '' . 
  there 's paltinis and cheile cibinului and whatnot . 
  one of my favourite holidays ever ( i even said that on tv , a station had some reporting running in the village i was living in , and found me all enthusiastic sweating towards one of the hiking routes ) . 
  as for / r/wtf , yeah , we get coverage there , but we are a * wtf * nation , for better and worse . 
  the last two people on earth will be two romanians , nudging and sniggering at the mushroom cloud . 
  well , that 's one scenario . 
  we 're not big on suicide here . 
  oh , come on , back country ? 
  sibiu is one of my favourite places in romania !, 
  bucharest . 
  why ? 
  ^ ^ did ^ ^ the ^ ^ romanian ^ ^ spelling ^ ^ of ^ ^ woosh ^ ^ mislead ^ ^ you ? 
  u\u0219 , 
  interesting , we use * rumen * ( of slavic origin ) exlusively for the face . 
  our national identity best matches / r/wtf . 
   i 'm not saying it 's fair , i 'm saying it 's a fact of life . 
  as facts of life go , stealing for instance is easier and more cost effective than other activities . 
  it is also immoral and illegal . 
   it 's not indefensible . 
  neither is not hiring women . 
  they have a couple of unproductive days every month , and then they give birth and stay home for two years , leaving the company to scramble for replacements . 
  older people - in their late thirties - also have a lot of problems with kids and such , and should be thoroughly avoided by any wise business . 
  oh , and you know those colored people ? 
  they smell funny and are bad for office morale . 
   the masses needed him dead citation needed . 
  there 's no clear evidence on what anybody wanted , all people i know would have wanted an actual trial . 
  the `` trial '' and execution were presented post-factum on national tv , with the official argument that it was a necessity as to quell the `` terrorists '' , mysterious gunmen who shot randomly all through bucharest and indeed disappeared soon after ceausescu 's execution . 
  none were ever brought to justice . 
  the net result was that second-rank communists under the leadership of iliescu were never confronted with whatever ceausescu might have used for his defense in a real trial , allowing them to keep the good-guy image . 
  the death penalty was abolished in the same day ( iirc ) and was briefly reinstated ( for a couple of hours ) on 12-13 january , officially at the `` pressure of the population '' ( and with the intention to apply it to ceausescu 's youngest son ) - mostly a diversion to allow iliescu to take back together with the other `` concession '' he had made that night - outlawing of the rcp . 
  there was never any public pressure towards reinstating the death penalty ever since . 
  vodka * is * russian water . 
  fucking close to nothing ? 
  voda = water . 
  vodka is a diminutive of that . 
  thanks !, 
  nobody can say now i do n't understand a single word in finnish , 
  oh , the * se * works just like in romanian  totul e sa * ne * intelegem . 
  thanks . 
  it is important to understand ( ? ), 
  and [ loituma ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn4clliknoa ) . 
   * ceas * / * ceasornic * would have been too low brow to fit bolintineanu 's pretense . 
  the first line of this poem ( not quoted here ) is the romanian equivalent of [ * it was a dark and stormy night * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it_was_a_dark_and_stormy_night ) . 
  i speak a romance language . 
  you did a lot better than i could have on / u/nahden 's post ( although romanian has some slavic as well ) . 
  perhaps it 's a person 's name he forgot to capitalize ?
