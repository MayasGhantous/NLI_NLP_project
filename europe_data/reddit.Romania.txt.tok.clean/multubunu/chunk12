  i thought that was finnish for karma . 
   tomorrow , at dawn , at the time when the fields are whitening  i 'll leave . 
  you see , i know that you 're waiting for me  i 'll go through the woods , ill go over the mountain  i can not remain away from you anymore . 
  ( imperfect , but did my best to fit hugo 's meter ) . 
  the rain in spain stays mainly in the plain ? 
  ... something about karma ? 
  and is related to * hour * and * heure * , from greek * hora * , from pie \\* yer meaning * year * or * season * . 
  heh , you did n't study any russian then . 
  hum . 
  how did i do ? 
  http://dexonline.ro/definitie/mu%c8%99at/503508 also at the origin of moldavia 's ruling family 's name . 
  there 's many others . 
  another favorite : * [ * cump\u0103t * ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/cump%c4%83t/443699 ) - a bit quaint but alive in expressions / composite words , means ` one 's cool ' or ` moderation ' ( in * cump\u0103tat * = * moderate * , * ballanced * ) comes essentially from * computare * , and guess what english cognate it has . 
  i believe what you call pseudo-anglicisms are [ false friends ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_friends ) in the making . 
  examples would be the english word * physician * , which many outside the english speaking world would think means * physicist * . 
  i ca n't think of any such words in romanian from english , but here 's a couple from latin which i find hilarious : * * buc\u0103 * ( buttock , obsolete : cheek , compare with ` ass cheeks ' ) from latin * bucca * ( mouth ) * * gur\u0103 * ( mouth ) from latin * gula * ( snout ) * * c\u0103tu\u0219\u0103 * ( [ hand ] cuff ) , diminutive from latin * catta * ( cat ) ; it still meant * kitten * ( as well ) in the 18th century * * mu\u0219e\u021bel * ( chamomile ) , from * frumos * < latin * formosus * ( fair , beautiful ) * * pul\u0103 * ( dick , penis ) from latin * pullus * ( chick , chicken ) ( * coco\u0219 * meaning * cock * is an euphemism ) * * p\u0103m\u00e2nt * ( earth , earth , ground ) from latin * pavimentum * ( pavement ), 
  i think i have a spare pound this one time , pm the address . 
  no h either ... 
  beautiful place !, 
  just in case . 
  if you are a lady , then it 's * rom\u00e2nc\u0103 * ( feminine , vs * rom\u00e2n * in the masculine gender ) . 
  well , as long as you do n't spell it buc ** h ** arest .

  [ you are not alone ] ( http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2013/bucharest-not-budapest/ ) . 
   budapest is there dude , [ spread the word ] ( http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2013/bucharest-not-budapest/ ) !, 
  i suppose it started because of frustration with de gaulle 's dance around nato in the late fifties . 
  it literally means * white rus ' * , or * white ruthenia * . 
  also , the term white might be an archaic name for a cardinal direction , i.e. 
  north -  white , west -  red , south -  black , and east -  green . 
  so belarus might mean * northern rus ' / ruthenia * - although there is not a lot of evidence for that interpretation . 
  well , last year easter was in april , in may this year , and the one day means 4-5 % of the month . 
  compensating for that would give ~ +9 % for april and 0 ... +1 % for may . 
  moreover , many took some vacation to link the holidays with weekends and there you have it . 
  the april number is also disproportionately large if you look at the rest of the months , and it may simply mean a poor performance in april 2012 . 
  fair enough back to you , i did n't downvote or anything , just expressed a view . 
  and i meant it with las cases , as i remember he describes the same ` meritocracy ' outside democracy . 
  funny it was written in exile , though . 
  this guy has the same old talking points , ` original democracy ' , ` our own way ' and stuff , but bypasses major problems like 80 % of the country living in poverty ? 
  and * for the rest * , the success stories , shit [ like this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foxconn_suicides ) ? 
  ( edit ) just to clarify , when i said ` here 's an interesting book * for you * ' - i meant for * him * . 
  oh , i saw that point , but it seemed to me it was way overstated . 
  as one that has lived the ` bad times ' he is talking about , it sounded as a bit of ` new propaganda ' gorbachev style . 
  yeah , heard it all before , the elite , the meritocracy , how the smart folks make better decisions for the whole of society . 
  democracy means bush , har-har . 
  proof ? 
  the ` special zones ' thrive !, 
  of course , no point in mentioning the exceptions , [ corruption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_china ) at [ local ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sichuan_schools_corruption_scandal ) and [ government ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/08/liu-zhijun-sentenced-death-corruption ) level , the [ ghost cities ] ( http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1975397,00.html ) , the [ poverty of interior china ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_the_people%27s_republic_of_china ) - almost a billion live below $ 5/day . 
  here 's an interesting read for you : * m\u00e9morial de s ^ ( te ) h\u00e9l\u00e8ne * , by las cases . 
   depends how you define european . 
  indeed . 
  to me , it 's about a distaste for hereditary elites , coming straight from our founders , athenian democracy and roman republic . 
  republic and democracy mean roughly the same thing , a society controlled by its citizens . 
  these concepts may have been latent for centuries , but have surfaced again eventually , and out here in eastern europe they carry a lot of weight ( though we do n't really know how to deal with them ) . 
  to me the beginnings of europe are at the battle of [ marathon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_marathon ) , the one quoted to be more important to british history than the battle of hastings . 
  a citizens ' army defeating the slave army of a `` god '' king . 
  one may claim that it 's solely herodotus ' interpretation that the greeks would rather die than be slaves to one man ; but if soldiers make history , it 's writers who write it and inspire later generations . 
  tl ; dr : i understand europe as a citizen-centric culture , a principle i adhere to . 
  i can only hope the eu will stick to this concept . 
  they wo n't if - as i believe - the problem is corruption at the local level . 
  donuts , no , not so much , 
  ca n't decide on one ... 
  here 's some sweets . 
  * [ minciunele ] ( http://www.info-delta.ro/archive/imagini/133_1c44308be67b695145719383a81f6ca6_0.jpg ) - unleavened dough of flour and egg , fried and served either sweetened as dessert or spicy as aperitif . 
  * [ poale-n brau ] ( http://www.inbucovina.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/placinte-poale-n-brau.jpg ) - a dough of flour , egg and milk enclosing a filling based on cottage cheese . 
  * [ cozonac ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cozonac ) * [ papanasi ] ( http://www.e-retete.ro/imagini/retete/papanasi.jpg ) - fried dumplings made of flour , cottage cheese and eggs , served with cream and jam . 
  the romanian word for money is * bani * ( sg . 
  * ban * ) , of unknown origin . 
  it works a little as french * sous * , plural means * money * , singular means * coin * . 
  it has a phonetic connection to the word * banca * ( bank ) , without being cognates . 
  in turn , the word * taler * , originating in the name of a silver mine in bohemia , eventually transformed in * dollar * . 
  * batrana * used to mean [ 1.000 lei ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/b%c4%83tr%c3%aen/416956 ) , an exact equivalent for * grand * . 
  i appears to have designated the [ highest value banknote ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/b%c4%83tr%c3%a2n%c4%83/515107 ) at various moments in time , so maybe it just settled for 100.000 in your area at some point . 
  heh , yes . 
  what i meant to say is that - to me at least - portuguese sounds like i 'm just about to understand what they 're saying , which builds unwarranted expectation . 
   romanians do n't understand a word of spoken portuguese ( written is another story )  com carne de vaca n\u00e3o se morre de fome is even better as spoken . 
  also , ` tu es ' reads ` tu e\u0219 ' , just as we often pronounce ` tu e\u0219ti ' ( ce-\u0219 ' nebun ? ) . 
  to me it sounds more like someone talking [ funny romanian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wppord8wbag ) , and it 's frustrating to not understand . 
  i guess we could understand more if we 'd expect to understand less . 
  the northern countries do n't need that many . 
  we ca n't afford that many . 
  seriously , though , romania is pretty safe as violent crime goes . 
  ... for now . 
  next year , poland , beware !, 
  that 's not what bobu says . 
  actually , the mike probably got only half the phrase , and i 'd guess ' [ haideti mai ] bine in sediu ' approximately ` let 's better go inside the building ' . 
  protesters never got into the building until more than 24 hours later , and there certainly was no immediate danger of that at that moment . 
   who literally spits in the face of the person who just saved them from getting stabbed ? 
  people who grew up in a generally hostile environment . 
  it 's not personal , they had nothing against you , they just abhor `` strangers '' because their life experience says they 're hostile and potentially dangerous . 
  where i live i made `` friends '' with some gypsies simply by saying hello . 
  not shitting you , they were kids playing with the `` white '' kids at the entrance to my block , and i just said hello to all of them when i was entering . 
  ten years later , the gypsy folk still salute me from a distance and engage in conversation , they do n't do it with anybody else . 
  no spitting in my face either . 
  one of the girls had the nickname * blacky * . 
  i suppose i got points for never using that .

  my parents used to have a radio set called estonia-3m . 
  early sixties , wooden box , 2 speakers , included record player . 
  it even had fm ( oirt , but fm on valves ? ) . 
  the hifi of its time , and as they said , expensive as hell .
