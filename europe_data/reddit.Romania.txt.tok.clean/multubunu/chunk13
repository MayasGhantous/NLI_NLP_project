  so maybe consumer electronics was more for export ?

  / edit i have no recollection of any latvian consumer electronics , but then it 's been a long time . 
  if memory serves estonia was an important industrial center in the ussr particularly in electronics , and comparatively wealthy as soviet republics went . 
  it was also heavily colonized by russians , moreso than the other occupied countries . 
  estonian is one of few non-indoeuropean languages surviving in europe ( others being the related finnish and hungarian , maltese , and basque ) . 
  ( hopefully right , no google ), 
  ... and english * - ish * , french * - esque * , romanian * - esc [ u ] * , latin * - iscus * from a [ germanic source ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-esque&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) . 
  [ portugalsko ] ( http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugalsko ) , of course . 
  also , i doubt it 's halal to write islam over sculptures of animals . 
  ( edit ) no , really . 
  islam does n't approve of sculptures of any kind , furthermore i doubt people are encouraged to paint the word islam just anywhere , especially on [ forbidden ] representations of [ inferior beings like ] animals . 
  i highly suspect the one with the animals in war monument is in fact blasphemous . 
  yes , that 's adding to my point . 
  i was trying to build up to the second paragraph in my post , 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's some law he broke sometime , instigation to one thing or other . 
  on the other hand it does n't help making him look like a martyr to his following . 
  perhaps programs like this one are the best way to tackle the problem . 
  the all-knowing bigot making tall claims on what ` most muslims ' think only to be called on it by the other two * muslims * present , and especially the ` unislamic to kill innocents ' bit - you ca n't hide behind ` difference of opinion ' and still look like a serious * religious * leader , all dogmatic and shit . 
   people like him should n't be given the opportunity to claim they represent the majority on national television . 
  perhaps they should , as a test to that claim . 
  it 's not like he was their alone making speeches , and the other two guests did a pretty good job at countering his claims . 
  such a presentation will not radicalize anyone , and sadly , it wo n't * de * radicalize ( is that a word ? ), 
  anyone , but * may * discourage young people from * becoming * radicals . 
  i mean , it was stated that slaughtering innocents was un-islamic and he , a cleric , did n't have a come back . 
  he looked all righteous and assured of himself , but in the end he lost the debate . 
   nothing is as old as yesterday 's news . 
  then last year 's news is not that old . 
  and this article was not posted for news value , but for the racism related commentary , ever so topical in [ / r / ] europe .

  meh , but not that shameful really ( except for the plagiat ) . 
  cowboys ? 
  we 're horsemen !, 
  no , he 's not . 
  because it 's bad cannibalism , not like the good stuff in papua et.al . 
  :  another category is mortuary cannibalism , the consumption of the dead during their funeral rites , practiced through the 20th century in the eastern highlands province of papua new guinea and the brazilian and peruvian amazon . 
  `` this is not , as we may instinctively imagine , morbid and repulsive , '' notes the university of manchester 's sarah-louise flowers in her conference abstract , `` but is instead ** an act of affection and respect for the dead person ** , as a well as being a means of helping survivors to cope with their grief . '', 
  hm , i think my answers were exactly that except i did n't trust either healthcare or military . 
  til . 
  what were your answers ?? 
  i wanted france , but i was saddled with sweden :(, 
  it 's not about where you * want * to live , but * inner nationality * , i.e. 
  you 're a swede in a spaniard 's body . 
  i got sweden too , rather unexpected for me . 
  it 's a clash of civilizations . 
  islamists may have to learn from the protestant work ethic . 
  tl ; dr : british person answering the question ` is the eu really that bad ? ', 
  by saying ` the uk would be worse without it ' . 
  is there anybody from the uk that could find a single ` good ' thing about the eu per se ? 
  i mean beyond ` we need them for this and that ' . 
  let me try : how about we start by avoiding acronyms like piigs and gipsis ? 
  we ca n't fit the new c and s in there anyway . 
   thank you germany for correcting i ... me ? 
  history is * soo * last year . 
  south america is a country , jackass . 
  which shows you are not acquainted to gin . 
  it was posted on blogspot.ro , but the blog text [ objavila oseba ] is in slovenian . 
  the news here is that finland maintains such a list , in a fashion that allows such incredible errors . 
  putin has nothing to worry , but how about you , do * you * own a motorbike ?

   \u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf hehe , one of the first words i managed to read was * metaphores * - on most trucks . 
  some book retailer , i thought at the first one , but by the tenth i was curious and asked . 
  * metaphores * means transportation ( meta -  trans , phorizo -  portare aka carry , * transport * is the latin translation ) . 
  so , the word * metaphor * is itself a metaphor . 
  i was thinking * sz\u00e1rk\u00f6zy * ? 
  although * sharkeuzee * ( aka s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy ) ahs a nice ring to it . 
   i just hope it 's dealt with in a civil manner and does n't degenerate into a yugoslav-style civil war . 
  we 've already missed that opportunity in 15-mar-1990 , in much more troubled times . 
  the nationalistic parties have lost a lot of traction , and none made it to the parliament at the last elections . 
  looking good ... though of course , nobody knows the future . 
  did you read the article ? 
  [ polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) seems to have had some similarity , a union of nations that kept part of their individuality . 
  the beginnings of romania was a `` personal union '' between the then states of [ moldavia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavia ) and [ tara romaneasca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tara_romaneasca ) , but the political class in both countries was already determined in forming a single state . 
   in hungary the constitution is not changed through a referendum , it 's changed by the unicameral parliament if more than 2/3 of the mps vote yes . 
  i did n't know that . 
  in romania , 2/3 of parliament may * initiate * constitutional changes , but those still need to be approved by referendum - and this is in the constitution . 
  this renders most of the legitimity argument moot - if the cc finds a law unconstitutional , the parliament can simply change the constitution to fit that law , and this fits particularly well the fidesz in the current state of affairs , with more than 2/3 of parliament under their control . 
  as a matter of fact , it is made simple by the [ 2013 amendment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_constitution#2013_amendment ) :  the court can not annul a law passed by a two-thirds parliamentary majority . 
  i suppose some of the international suspicions are based simply on the fact of the 2/3 fidesz majority which passed a constitution favoring 2/3 parliamentary majorities . 
  the fact is , whatever they vote now , it wo n't be easy to undo for a long time to come , and they get to name the members of the cc ( by a 2/3 majority ) for 12 years . 
  do n't get me wrong , we 're very near this same situation ourselves ... 
   constitutions in all nations are prone to change . 
  certainly . 
  but if a constitution is passed by referendum , all amendments should be subject to the same . 
  speaking of hungary , flyingorange 's comment might be a little unclear - did the cc `` change '' the constitution in the past ? 
  or did the parliament try , and was prevented by the cc . 
  also this :  constitutional court may indeed give opinion about laws , it may only not reject constitutional laws . 
  the cc is the authority that decides if a law is constitutional or not . 
  if the constitution is ambiguous - often the case in new democracies - it is the cc 's interpretation of it that takes precedence . 
  opinions are the competency of everybody and their dog . 
  well , per 2002 data , * for this age group * it 's pink ( 96 ) . 
  even if you look at 20-24 ( that would be 24-28 in 2008 , so close ) it 's still 96 . 
  for 2011 there are no stats per sex + age yet . 
  some are . 
  the one at unirii ( the first picture in the article ) used to be a low-end shopping area for a long time , it 's currently being modernized . 
  i do n't know where is the one in the second picture , or it 's current state . 
  plenty of malls anyway , some were built from scratch . 
  preliminary results from the 2011 census do not contain such fine grained statistics as distribution by sex * and * age groups . 
  in bucharest , per sex , 116 ( see [ here - pdf ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ts4.pdf ) ) . 
  ~ ~ not sure about the 2002 census though . ~ ~ 96 for this age group in 2002 ( [ source - pdf ] ( http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/rpl2002ins/vol1/tabele/t05.pdf ) ) .
