  some trivia and legends for the romanian bits * the palace of parliament in bucharest , formerly * house of the people * , is much larger than the pictures make it look . 
  it is sort of a large scale model of itself , it 's proportions make it look more human-scale . 
  * it is built on a small hill in the middle of a large space . 
  the space was obtained by demolishing most of the historical area of central bucharest , including a hill called dealul spirii ( once near the river ) and the 16th century palace on top . 
  rubble from the former hill is now the hill on which the current palace resides . 
  at the time , the joke went ` since * he * could n't become a historical figure , * he * tried geography ) . 
  * the unirii bld . 
  ( * unification * in the article ) was originally called - in the same bombastic style - the * victory of the socialism * bld . 
  the same jokers added * over the entire people * , otherwise a stereotypical phrase of the wooden tongue . 
  * the unirii bld . 
  was built on space obtained by demolishing large parts of former middle class neighborhoods . 
  the style is said to mimic north korean architecture . 
  however , this effect seemed to have been obtained not so much by architect study , but by ceausescu himself having construction of a single block finished each week , then remade after his weekly commentary upon viewing ( on saturdays , 8-9 am if memory servers ) . 
  * the * house of the people * was designed by four teams of architects , a quadrant each . 
  i have some anecdotes from a guy who worked as a model maker with one of the teams . 
  apparently , a couple of floors ended with no access , which had to be provided on the spot while building the thing . 
  some floors were misaligned ( vertically ) , i understand this was never fixed ( meaning floors are not in the same horizontal plane around the building in some sections ) . 
  there is an 18m tall wc somewhere ( if you use that , do n't fart ) . 
  several architects died of heart attacks during design and construction . 
  * during area design , a model of the whole area would be presented to ceausescu , who would pick model buildings and move them around a bit , then ask for the whole thing to be redone . 
  this resulted for example in mindless crosses such as [ this ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.428615,26.101167&amp;spn=0.001446,0.00327&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.428615,26.101167&amp;panoid=vtf_talesxuan5kpwb9jvg&amp;cbp=12,263.15,,0,22.08 ) . 
  however , digs were started as soon as architects draw the plans , and had to be filled/redone to fit the weekly changes . 
  it is said that someone had the idea of gluing the blocks on the area model , and ceausescu - who had never asked for movable blocks - finally approved the model as it was . 
  * `` hunger circus '' was a joke name for the structures . 
  they were built at a time when all the shops were empty , and were believed to be intended to become large canteens , to `` solve '' the food shortage problem ( i.e. 
  you would n't buy and cook your own food , but eat whatever would be provided there ) . 
  according to the urbanistic plans , they were supposed to be `` markets containing a dining area '' . 
  * the first picture of `` blocks of flats '' is the most representative . 
  take a walk around [ this area ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.414186,26.142975&amp;spn=0.023267,0.052314&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.414186,26.142975&amp;panoid=apwztncgijimxksqvl7uzg&amp;cbp=12,38.88,,0,-5.41 ) ( not the worst blocks-neighbourhood in bucharest ) . 
  ( edit ) excelsior !, 
  haha , i could swear it was related to * krater * , but i thought it was modified to look like * flikr * , the double d connection never occurred to me . 
  actually , the prefixed ` a ' can be patrilineal as well : * nic\u0103 al lui \u015etefan a petrei * means ion , son of \u015etefan , son of petrea ( aka petru ) . 
  this works with names ending in a : petrea -  apetrii , toma -  atomei ( should work with spirea as well , but the only person i could find named aspirei is probably not romanian ) . 
  when the name refers to a female ascendant , normaly wife of one petrea or toma , you get apetroaiei , atomoaiei - yes , these end in five vowels ( sort of ) . 
  of azor = ' a zor ' aka quick , swift . 
  i doubt * zdrean\u021b\u0103 * ever had any popularity as a dog name , besides arghezi 's poem . 
  another dog name would be negril\u0103 ( blacky ) . 
  technically , popescu does not mean ` son of a priest ' , but rather anything belonging/characteristic of a priest . 
  the suffix * - esc * is pretty similar in meaning to french * - esque * or polish * - eski * . 
  as a name forming particle , it was characteristic for the aristocracy , who had family names long before the lower classes . 
  the mechanism being ion -  ionestii ( plural , ion 's family ) -  ionescu ( singular by back formation from the `` clan '' name ) . 
  when surnames became mandatory for all classes , the `` middle class '' ( as defined by law in the 19th century ) included numerous sons of priests , who modified the `` son of a priest '' patronimic ( * al popii * ) by adding the aristocratic suffix . 
  [ not all the time , though ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mywaxtvtswi ) . 
  [ another article ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5489514 ) . 
  also , the dates are fixed , meaning easter and carnival may not include the actual feast days in some years . 
  it 's meant to mean * conceited * . 
   it seemed really strange , me doing a eurovision song , i do n't usually do that i think perhaps you may find this is the understatement of the year . 
  one of the most popular [ eurovision winners ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsvemz1f5c ) ever versus contemporary [ black sabbath ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqj4utexulq ) , not [ at their best ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyu-ybi8fdq ) . 
  / r/fences, 
  aaaand as usual , we 're the last ones :( snow only started falling yesterday . 
  i wonder how they let us join the eu ... 
  several italian banks temporarily suspended * trading * . 
  it 's in the text :  trading in several italian banks have just been temporarily suspended ( for dropping more than 5 % ) . 
   reaction to follow !, 
   updated at 4.29 pm gmt, 
  it 's the same letter , but not the same sound . 
  in romanian ` i ' is used to denote : well , * i * ; german * j * ; and slavic ` soft sign ' , i.e. 
  russian * \u044c * . 
  the i in bucuresti is the ` soft sign ' . 
  the * i * in ` iepure ' is german * j * . 
  ` copiii ' contains a double proper * i * and a german * j * ( or russian * \u0439 * ) . 
  our alphabet is fucked up badly . 
  could it be such a eu-wide measure would reduce welfare tourism ? 
  his trolling on / r/romania was [ less successful ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/1584se/help_with_romanian_gf/ ) . 
   reversed comma and decimal point notation you guys have http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decimal_mark#hindu.e2.80.93arabic_numeral_system, 
   i want to speak to ` real ' romanians , but it 's difficult finding these on english-language sites many here would disagree , 
   depositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks . 
  i did n't see this in the spiegel article . 
  even so , hard to believe this is legal . 
  i was n't correcting you , but * them * - not the kids but the people who taught them . 
  the legionary salute , * de la inima la cer * , was a nice concept , but not particularly aesthetic ( i 've seen a video of sima doing it by the book , but could n't find it - it really does n't look very good ) . 
  so in time , and with the rapprochement to the nazis , it started to look more like the nazi salute . 
  but these people - again , not the children but their teachers - should know better . 
  if you want to be a nationalist and against the tide , the least you could do is do it right . 
  if the palm ends facing down , it 's * de la inima in praf * . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is that they are incompetent . 
  no surprise there , but here is proof . 
  i had horrible bad luck at kinder surprise . 
  i loved the ones that were supposed to be assembled . 
  i always got the one piece plastic dino , while everybody around me had 27 piece catamarans . 
   fascist version of ch\u00e9 guevara an excellent observation !, 
   the salute is a gesture belonging to a right-wing organization which called itself `` the iron guard '' no , that is the nazi salute . 
  the `` legionary '' salute , `` from the heart to the heavens '' is seen in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnd6_bcslr4&amp;t=17s ) , the second guy , antonescu , not horia sima - the speaker and chief of the iron guard - who only does the second movement . 
  the hand should start at the chest and end with the palm facing up , or at least forward . 
  romanian viewers may also be surprised by the similarity to later communist-era speeches/events . 
  we 're so poor we ca n't even afford pesticides . 
  * vlah * is not slavic , but rather [ germanic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlach#etymology ) , and a cognate to * welsh * and * waloon * . 
  the german minority in romania are called * sa\u0219i * ( sash < sachs ) in ardeal and * \u0218vabi * ( < schwaben ) in banat . 
  the ( slavic ) term * nem\u021bi * for germans has mostly given way to * germani * . 
  hungarians are called alternatively * unguri * and * maghiari * . 
  ( edit ) the aromanians are known as * \u021b\u00e2n\u021bar * , which coincides with the romanian word for mosquito . 
  it is however a deformation of the endonym * tsintsar * meaning * fiver * , and some say it is derived from the name of legio v macedonica which was based in moesia and * fiver * would have been a regional nickname for * roman * . 
  apple fined for not paying overtime !, 
  ^ ( ok , so what 's ftfy in french ? ), 
  there used to be some sweets in my youth , sort of sesame bars , whose packaging was made from rice paper and was edible ( not tasty , though ) . 
  chinese or vietnamese import . 
  pans are edible . 
  this is not necessarily [ new ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=129008757 ) , but apparently what happens here is that cesium tends to sink in the ground and be captured by surface and underground mushrooms ( like truffles ) , which in turn are beloved by boars ( truffles are harvested with the help of [ pigs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truffle#extraction ) ) . 
  i 'd really like to see a study on edible mushrooms , before i bring a geiger counter when i eat out . 
   i think not even nk is that stupid .
