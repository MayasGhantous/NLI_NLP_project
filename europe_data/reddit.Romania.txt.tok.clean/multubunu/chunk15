  if nk is stupid enough to launch a nuclear missile , they are stupid enough to launch it in any direction . 
  the [ spanish mep ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckaefi1it54#t=314s ) made sense on many levels . 
  one would be that someone will never be as proficient in their second language as in the first , and this is really a problem when drawing up laws and regulations . 
  the other , the emotional argument , is that it would be somewhat [ disrespectful to their own countrymen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckaefi1it54#t=415s ) . 
  also that story he had of a discussion about speaking one of three languages , for convenience , and he said alright , as long as nobody speaks their first language ( i.e. 
  british meps would speak french or german ) - and his british conlocutor said forget about it . 
  it 's difficult to appreciate - without direct experience - the effort ( and risk ) to using one 's secondary language , join a forum in your secondary language and you 'll see what i mean . 
  i suppose he meant [ pole ] ( http://www.caminodesantiago.me/wp-content/uploads/wooden-pole.jpg ) , not pole . 
   they often start speaking romanian and i just stare blankly . 
  aw , come on , it 's not that often . 
  and it 's just chatter when it happens . 
  the exchange above is just some jokes on corruption , one guy asking b for a job for a relative , the other fellow offers a chicken as bribe . 
  no , actually i 'm not sure you can find a bag of chips below 70c ( or 3 ron ) . 
  but then i rarely buy chips . 
  the _ export _ price might be 20c , but we pay romanian taxes on the products in the shops . 
   for his part , foreign minister titus corlatean first said that the country does not even want to join schengen anymore : `` we lived fine without schengen so far , we can continue to do so . '', 
  to be fair , what he said was along the lines of '' ** if romania 's entry is delayed ** we are not interested anymore '' . 
  he was immediately chastized by most , including some in his coalition . 
  the romanian argument is that romania has met the technical conditions for schengen admission ( at least that 's what we hear ) . 
   their complexion or phenotype resembles that of a middle eastern or south asian person . 
  he means gypsies . 
  i was just inferring from your statistics . 
  relax , all our criminals are already in england :  the violent crime rate in bucharest remains very low , with 11 murders and 983 other violent offenses taking place in 2007 . 
  [ 2 ] in 2011 there were 34 recorded murders . 
  [ 3 ] relative to the population of approximately 3 million ( unofficially [ 4 ] ) this makes bucharest the safest european capital . 
  ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_bucharest#violent_and_organised_crime ) ), 
  [ res ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) will do that , and a lot more . 
  i am pretty happy with [ reddit reveal ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/reddit-reveal/ ) , which does something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y133rbu.png ) ( i am hovering over your user name , the up/down votes are visible at any time ) . 
   does n't roma culture encourage separation and isolation if there is a roma culture , nobody knows what that is . 
  roma are not travellers , there may be nomadic roma somewhere but the ones we see are sedentary for generations . 
  where i live - bucharest - there are groups of _ homeless _ roma , but that 's not a cultural trait , just chronic poverty . 
  i do n't think gypsies try in any way to isolate themselves , more the other way around . 
  poverty breeds distrust and stigma . 
  vicious circle , hard to break . 
  kids born in such communities grow up with pickpockets , burglars and prostitutes , where respect is proportional to time spent in jail . 
  this is the only life they know and they grow up to become pickpockets , burglars and prostitutes . 
  this is not `` gypsy culture '' , as i said , watch [ the wire ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/ ) . 
  interesting you bring up travellers . 
  as i understand , they are not roma but actual irish ( at least genetically ) , that became nomadic some 1000 years ago . 
  in contrast , the roma are mostly sedentary today , watch these documentaries [ # 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgdj0b5wqaa ) , [ # 2 ] ( http://youtu.be/2lxahkcecjc ) ( one hour each ) . 
  the bosses build extravagant ( and rather horrible ) houses - these people are not nomads , they try to emulate rich whites . 
  in a twisted , perverse way , they try to integrate ... 
  so yeah , gypsy culture ? 
  i will second that . 
  actually , you never know they are roma because it is the question one never asks . 
  unless they say it themselves , and it happens . 
  i personally know people who went from mopping the floors in the factory to better / more qualified work , one girl went to uni and got a diploma . 
  some become famous , perhaps the best example is [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c4%83nel_nicoli%c8%9b%c4%83 ) ( yeah , he has a wikipedia page ) , a footballer who , anyone in romania would agree , did not build his career as much on talent , but on * hard work * . 
  his first name translates to `` dear money '' - as gypsy as they come . 
  this is not to say that significant numbers of roma do n't belong to crime-ridden communities . 
  some become famous as leaders of organized crime . 
  some engage in horrible things like child trafficking rings . 
  many are pickpockets or street robbers . 
  watch ` the wire ' . 
  but it is silly to lump everyone in like that .

  the israelis also have the [ horah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hora_%28dance%29#israeli_horah ) , likely imported from eastern europe , with the same `` union '' symbolism it has in romania ( per hora unirii ) .

  [ `` the investigation shows that spanghero knew that the meat labelled as beef could be horse . 
  there was a strong suspicion , '' hamon told a news conference , adding that a romanian supplier named in the affair seemed to have been acting in good faith . 
  ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20130214-france-french-firm-inquiry-horsemeat-beef ), 
   on wednesday the eu health commissioner tonio borg said eu states should test not only for horsemeat but also for the presence of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone ( `` bute '' ) , thought to be potentially harmful to humans . 
  [ and here 's why ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/feb/14/horsemeat-scandal-bute-food-chain ) . 
  certainly . 
  but the article does touch the interesting issue of habit and taste . 
  we do n't eat horse meat either in romania , i 've never seen any in shops , and i 've only eaten once as a novelty item in some wannabe restaurant . 
  yes , but he also said he supported modifications in romania 's constitution , and _ that _ is what romanian officials make a case of . 
  the third time i 'm saying this in this thread . 
  he also said the romanian constitution should be changed , which drew the govt 's reaction . 
  actually findus blames spanghero for mislabeling the meat as french produced beef . 
  this used to exist in pre-1990 romania , named ` remiza ' , in some more expensive restaurants . 
  the article omits an important point : the hungarian ambassador went a little far in suggesting changes to the romanian constitution , corlateanu 's reaction is specifically directed to that :  i am referring to the hungarian ambassador 's declarations , who told us earlier how to modify the romanian constitution [ ( mediafax through google translate ) ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mediafax.ro%2fpolitic%2freactia-lui-corlatean-la-declaratiile-ambasadorului-ungariei-sper-ca-e-vorba-de-o-greseala-10547771 ),

  cyrillic has been used for centuries in hand-written documents in parts of eastern europe and all russia . 
   also , [ this is beautiful ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/schriftzug_karolingische_minuskel.svg/1000px-schriftzug_karolingische_minuskel.svg.png ) .

  but above all , cyrillic includes signs for sounds specific to slavic languages ( \u044a , \u044b , \u044c ) , diphtongs ( \u044f , \u0435 , \u0451 , \u044e ) , and some that the latin alphabet struggles with ( \u0436 = zh , \u0446 = tz , \u0447 = ch , \u0448 = sh , \u0449 = shch ) .

  yes , it is . 
  on the other hand , english barbarisms ( in computing ) help one with english literature or the help facility . 
  it 's been a very long time since i read anything computer-related in romanian , and having to use two different languages would have made it harder . 
  also , i think you may have a problem with the word _ byte _ in french ,
