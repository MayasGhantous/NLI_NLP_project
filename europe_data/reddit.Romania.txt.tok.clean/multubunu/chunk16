  ... and _ card _ , like in _ sound card _ ( _ plac\u0103 de sunet _ ) . 
  the meaning is card/board . 
  but phonetically , it 's close to neither . 
  the word comes from french , but the french use _ carte _ for both . 
   limba rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 to limba rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 rum\u00e2n and rom\u00e2n came to mean different things long before the relatinization movement ( the former meaning serf , the latter romanian ) . 
  i believe the relatinizing movement practically failed in what it had set out to do . 
  most words it proposed failed to catch and some are still here only because they were ridiculed by contemporaries ( sufragiu , amor , amic etc. ) . 
  many ( most ? ), 
  slavic words that disappeared did so due to the obsolescence of their object ; for instance _ ispravnic _ ( approx prefect ) disappeared with the position , but _ isprav\u0103 _ , _ ispr\u0103vi _ , _ neispr\u0103vit _ are still here , perhaps a bit quaint . 
  they are _ all _ still in current use , with just one - calic - being used mostly metaphorically ( avaricious instead of poor/beggar ) ; it was replaced with another slavic word , _ s\u0103rac _ . 
  also , if you understand romanian , you will notice in the article strange word forms , e.g. 
  _ emo\u021biune _ where we now say _ emo\u021bie _ , a sign that latinizers did n't fully get their way even where their neologisms survived . 
  relatinization succeeded mostly in accustoming the public to foreign import . 
  consequently , almost all new words in the 20th century are taken from french or italian ( but also german , and more recently english ) , where perhaps they might have been created from scratch as needed . 
  this does skew the latin word proportion of the lexicon , but most of the original slavic words are alive and kicking . 
  hell , we say _ da _ for _ yes _ , you do n't , ano ? 
   ( disclaimer : i am not a linguist ) . 
  some of these terms precede computing . 
  this one might originate with typewriters . 
  we do seem to have one original term , _ plac\u0103 _ , in all languages i can think of this is a variation of _ card _ . 
  it 's still used by mine ( i am a bit older ) . 
  i learned it in poli , and still use it alongside with _ byte _ . 
  also , _ dischet\u0103 _ was used interchangeably with _ floppy _ , but the technology is obsolete so we shall never know who won . 
  _ imprimant\u0103 _ is another french import , and i 'm pretty sure there are others . 
  might precede computers . 
  monitor < moniteur ( although it 's still monitor in english ) . 
  the original foreign partner for romanian cs were the french ( in the '60s - '70s ) , so we still have some french terms like _ fichier _ ( fi\u0219ier ) or _ disquette _ ( dischet\u0103 ) , and _ octet _ is slowly giving way to _ byte _ . 
   the influx of money that a corporation brings into a country when it decides to set up shop i probably misunderstood that line . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  a good part of the 4bn will likely be spent on the manufacturing machinery , which is not produced locally . 
  another part will go to training costs ( returning to intel ) . 
  perhaps they will erect and furnish the building with local resources , but i do n't think there 's a lot more than that . 
   denmark announced a sudden decision to restore customs controls at its borders with sweden and germany ok , what 's the real explanation here ? 
  i doubt denmark fears waves of maghrebian boat people coming in via sweden . 
  um , [ i was joking as well ] ( http://www.dogguide.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3696940272_55ab14a0c5.jpg ) . 
  i did n't think i _ really _ seemed offended  as hard liquor goes , 40 % is pretty much the definition ( jack daniels is about that ) . 
  we do have 60 % drinks - the fearsome horinca - not for wussies like me . 
  but , i suppose with proper training and lots of exercise one can handle that eventually . 
  goodbye draft damage . 
  also , next time you meet the friends you mentioned , challenge them to drinking wine . 
  people usually `` specialize '' , and one who drinks liquor will handle wine poorly . 
  you 'll have your revenge ( and pay for it by putting them to bed and cleaning the room ) . 
  bigoted south-westerners ... 
  it 's a shot of [ \u021buic\u0103 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuica ) that cures most everything . 
  it may also be related to poor teeth , some older people i know would keep cotton in their ears against that and i do n't think it 's a superstition , although i never had a toothache from draft . 
  i 'm not so sure about the island mentality . 
  every nation is its own metaphorical island . 
  how about switzerland ? 
  and i could n't really walk to france , you know , 
  i did n't mean it to be sneering , i did see your post as positive , and upvoted it . 
  it just struck me that , for me , holidaying in europe would be `` here '' . 
  i 'm really sorry if my post came out as criticizing or nitpicking . 
   i love europe . 
  i holiday ** t ** here often so much said with just one letter . 
  -------- ( edit ) my post was insensitive to aethelstan ... 
  sorry for that . 
  the point i was trying to make is that people in the uk seem to see the rest of europe as `` foreign '' , more than folks elsewhere in europe . 
  this may be a bigger problem for our common future than skepticism for the eu institutions ( which i think we all share to some extent ) . 
  [ great find ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16t8gi/road_transport_new_european_driving_licence/c7z4pij ) , dude !, 
  i think it had one , that 's how i remembered . 
   i have n't seen so many downvotes in a thread for a long time ( edit ) i 'm using [ reddit reveal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ud7hm.png ) . 
  the wreckless , but elusive , [ prawo jazdy ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7899171.stm ) will finally be arrested . 
  you have a point , but this should be discussed with / r/asia , / r/america , / r/southamerica and / r/australia . 
  we can probably skip / r/africa , they 're black . 
  nah , just / r/whiterights spilling over . 
  i have n't seen so many downvotes in a thread for a long time . 
  top comment is at +39 / -23 right now . 
  let 's not forget : europe for the basques . 
  hey , everybody here , back to transcaucazia ( except the hungarians , estonians and finns , you folks head to the urals ) . 
  which poses an interesting question : is there enough water for that ? 
  presuming all ice would melt , and no clouds ( although drastically higher temperatures should mean more evaporation ) , there may not be enough water for a 100m rise of the ocean . 
  i do n't have the numbers ... 
  heh , no offense intended , but perhaps you should have linked directly to the study . 
  the article does n't make the point it announces in the title ( ... central ... ) and furthermore , the not-so-peaceful nature of the minoans is [ nothing new ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minoans#warfare_and_.22the_minoan_peace.22 ) ( see the references as well ) , although not `` central '' to their culture ( aka no depictions of war , no weapons in graves , not much fortification etc. ) . 
  but thanks for the study , we 'll spend the weekend together , so to speak , 
  enough to be a sting . 
  not sure about the amount , 750,000 perhaps , but wages were a lot lower then so it seems ridiculous now . 
  it probably increased . 
  fond something , it 's 75-150 per oug 97/2005 . 
  30 euro is not much ... 
  oh , you risk a fine here as well , i paid it once  it 's not that big but the problem is you need to renew your _ viza de flotant _ every year , meaning long queues during working hours , and your landlord has to be present ( they require the property deed on the house ) . 
  well , this was ten years ago , it may have changed a bit . 
  not entirely , this would put us on par with hungary and above italy , portugal , poland , slovakia and slovenia , which is really not the case . 
  for western europe , it may still be a cultural thing . 
  for romania i would guess it reflects the fact that many young people in smaller places go to study in bigger cities , find work and remain there ( paying rent is a viable alternative to buying a house ) . 
  turing test result : failed . 
  thank you for your participation . 
  please try again . 
  [ do n't sweat it , man ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-state-science-council-denies-evolution-censor.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=39102&amp;newscatid=374 ) . 
  / r/romania has ~ 2500 , but per capita you still have twice as many as us . 
  discrediting the poster will not diminish the post . 
  you could have at least noticed the article is 10 months old , and perhaps argue that things have changed in the meantime , or , like quires123 , assert the jailed people are terrorists disguising as journalists ( and provide some source for that ) . 
  not improbable but impossible , i was using an extreme example to illustrate . 
  note we are not talking actual emigration , but moving within the country , which is fairly common for people with higher education , and not so unlikely for the rest . 
  i live in bucharest , _ more than half _ my team mates were born and raised somewhere else in the country . 
  for my initial question , yes , there 's some flaw in the evaluation process , and i 'm really curious which . 
  i do n't think agriculture , the south-east is mostly agri-based as well . 
  this is an unemployment map . 
  bucharest alone makes 20 % of the national gdp . 
  per capita it 's still first , while arges , constanta , and prahova ( all in the south ) are in the top 10 .
