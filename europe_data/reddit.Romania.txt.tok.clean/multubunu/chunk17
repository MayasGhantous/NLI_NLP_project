  the 15 counties above the national average are split 8-7 between west and south . 
  if all people who ca n't find work leave the county , then all the remainder is 100 % employed . 
  i 'm more intrigued with northern moldavia and oltenia having better rates than most of europe ? 
  these are notoriously poor zones . 
  perhaps all young people left ? 
  we keep them in [ this heavily guarded building ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/palatul_parlamentului_1b.jpg ) , just keep out of it and you 'll be fine . 
  also [ sighisoara ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sighisoara ) and [ bucovina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suceava_county#tourism ) . 
  i [ mis ] read the whole thread in a hurry as i was leaving the office , and thought it was the `` evil nationalists pushed french on the people '' thing . 
  for _ frigid _ , an english speaking person will likely understand it as [ intensely cold ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frigid ) , more so given the context . 
  as a romanian , i would n't have been mislead if the feminine _ frigid\u0103 _ was used instead . 
  there are many problems with that article . 
  first , if you look at the word examples , it seems the person who compiled the list is not a native speaker . 
  no , _ frigid _ does not men cold  and agil , really ? 
  when did you last hear someone using that word ? 
  dentist did not replace any previous word ( and has no synonyms ) , it came about with the profession ; neither did acvatic , a technical term . 
  direct has no slavic counterpart afaik , the same word exists in serbo-croatian ( per google translate ) and there is no other single word to fully describe the concept ( nemijlocit is a partial synonym in full current use ) . 
  rapid is the only word in the list that may seem truly unnecessary - but it did not replace iute . 
  relatinization was much vilified , and i suspect russian `` influence '' had something to do with it . 
  from what i could piece from later colleagues , most had had english as either main or secondary ( and my so concurs ) . 
  i took private french classes , which would n't have happened if english-french would have been available in my school ( in bucharest ) . 
  i 'm not sure this varied with time , but rather with the specific school , as they probably could n't hire too many foreign language teachers , so had to keep the same combo [ s ] over time . 
  the school nearest to my house had italian as main , at least for some of the classes . 
  actually , english was perhaps the most taught foreign language since at least the seventies . 
  i do n't have any figures , but that was my impression . 
  foreign languages were taught in combos of `` main '' ( starting in second grade ) and `` secondary '' ( starting in the fifth ) continuing until the twelfth grade . 
  the most common was english-russian , followed by german-french . 
  other combinations existed as well . 
  some schools had both foreign languages starting in the fifth grade . 
  i contend it 's called : engrish . 
   they can claim funding roughly proportionate to the amount of votes they get . 
  i sort of expected that , but this is what i find curious . 
  such `` party '' foundations serve to further the party 's agenda and proselytize , and proportionality makes things worse , sort of a positive feedback loop . 
  this system favours the strong , and i find this rather unsettling . 
  romania aside , i do n't really understand this system . 
  i gather german political parties may claim state funding for their `` associated '' foundations , e.g. 
  the kaf gets some [ 97 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_adenauer_foundation#finances ) of its money ( $ 120m ! ), 
  from the state . 
  what purpose could this serve ? 
   the tragicomedy of greece continues !, 
  which part did you find comical ? 
  i did n't read anything by hertha muller , but talking about dissent literature , ** paul goma ** should be mentioned , as well as ** ion ioanid ** . 
  romanian . 
  it 's simply killing me . 
   the fact that north and south korean border guards can blare insults at each other , and be understood , is why the border will disappear when the north 's regime does . 
  i 'm a sucker for this kind of reverie , but one should remember that serbs , croatians and bosnians were free to hurl insults at each other , and be understood , before there was any real border between them . 
  i know this will hurt some people here , and i apologize for that , but one should be weary of wishful thinking and this needed be said . 
  interesting choice , perhaps you could elaborate ? 
  i did n't travel enough to make comparisons , but i did spend a couple of months in athens , and loved it . 
  it 's mostly about the people , friendly and considerate , and they always looked so relaxed , even when talking passionately . 
  the one place where you can go people-spotting . 
  and whatever might be construed as a flaw was familiar from romanians , so it did n't really bother me . 
  also , i never understood the `` greeks are lazy '' mantra . 
  many people i knew had a second job , some worked another during the weekend . 
  for those who only get the first paragraph , here 's the [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/12/hungary-energy-prices-idusl5e8nc92w20121212 ) piece . 
  what you say about america is not entirely true . 
  the presidential pension was invented for harry truman , who after leaving the presidency had a pension of about $ 100 / month and lived by selling inherited some property ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harry_s._truman#post-presidency ) ) . 
  every once or twice in a century there is an honest politician in any given country , there may be more in finland , i honestly have no idea . 
   we had centrally planned economy for 50 years , and everybody remembers where it leads . 
  from what i remember , it leads to a free black market taking over the consumer goods distribution , while the industrial market crumbles in all sorts of underhand deals designed to make managers appear to accomplish the party 's vision . 
  the most insidious result being large scale corruption at all levels of the society . 
  it is generally accepted that one should bribe doctors and nurses here . 
  i did it three times ( twice money , once flowers ) , unsolicited , and have been refused four times , despite my insistence . 
  i have never personally been asked for anything , this extends to my so and her family . 
  flyingorange 's [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/15o5ig/how_many_of_you_have_given_a_present_to_your/c7o8u52 ) applies as well , if seeing the same doctor regularly , one would act as in any visit , bring some flowers or candy , or more expensive items depending on the issue . 
  this fall in a grey area between present and bribe . 
  this in the free system , which currently gives way to a private system where - to my knowledge - bribe is neither solicited nor accepted . 
  even so , it seems more expensive than the former . 
  just walked the dog , i can confirm we are enjoying a grey christmas , with melting snow everywhere . 
  bucharest , why ? 
  about -3 right now . 
  pretty white outside . 
  +7 announced for tomorrow , though . 
  way above normal temperatures for this time of year . 
  we 're not celebrating christmas eve as such , but christmas begins at midnight on the 25-th , many ( most ? ), 
  will start feasting at that time . 
  edit : ugh . 
  there 's plenty of tradition re christmas eve , i.e. 
  [ colinde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colind%c4%83 ) . 
  i was thinking in terms of feasting , which you can ' r really do on a fasting day , with no meat , milk , eggs and fish . 
  the feast _ should _ start after midnight , then you can eat and drink too much , and post rubbish on reddit ... 
  [ the etymology is disputed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craciun ) also , [ cioranescu ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/cr%c4%83ciun/442663 ) ( der ) , while agreeing the etymology is not clear , states that `` the slavic etymons do not seem possible '' - i sort of prefer der over conflicting wikipedia articles . 
   in ukraine , more than 80 lives were claimed and more than 500 people hospitalised after temperatures dropped and stayed at minus 17 celsius . 
  this ca n't be the whole story , -17 is really not that bad . 
  we get that every other winter in bucharest , it 's harsh , but not deadly , as long as you do n't sleep outside . 
  any ukrainian folks to fill us in on what 's really going on ? 
   i 'm not saying it 's the right thing to do , and not my personal position on this , just trying to answer your question . 
  well , i do n't think there is a single romanian view just as there is no single hungarian view on that . 
  for one thing , in part of the ardeal ( where hungarian minorities reside ) , it 's bound to be different that in the east or south . 
  one thing to note , we do n't see ourselves that much as ` east ' ( or hungarians as ` west ' ) , whatever is singular to our identity is pretty much [ old enough ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/146lu7/any_insight_would_be_helpful_mul%c8%9bumesc/c7c4a2d ) as to transcend such divisions . 
  if anything , we see ourselves as a romance culture , descendents of the roman empire , that 's as western as it can get here . 
  it 's not really that important how exact that is historically ( just as the `` 1000 years '' ) , this is the perception . 
  i do n't think there is much antagonism between the two states , outside the nationalist movements , and those are not that much of a big deal here . 
  but i think there is some resentment in romania for the rather well documented 19th century situation in ardeal ( if 1000 years is exaggerated ) . 
  i 'm not saying we 're angels , and the irony of denying [ some ] native-language rights to a minority is not lost on those who read how the same was denied to romanians under austria-hungary . 
  so there is an unofficial hatchet to bury . 
  i 'm not sure how that can be done . 
  i suppose that if a hungarian govt would come forth and say ` sorry for that shit in our common past , let 's put that behind us ' , it would be well received by most here - i 'm not saying it 's the right thing to do , and not my personal position on this , just trying to answer your question . 
  well , yes , but compare this with the issue of ardeal with hungary , the cadrilater story with bulgaria , the basarabia issue with ukraine , the [ republic of ] moldavia issue with russia , and the much older disputes with poland . 
  feel free to expand to other historical territorial issues ( e.g. 
  anglo-french ) in europe .
