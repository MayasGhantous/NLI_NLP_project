   i feel more european than romanian . 
  same here , to some extent . 
  but just posting here seems enough to express allegiance . 
  however , there are threads , like this one , where the national flag is important , like a disclaimer , if you will . 
  it just says ' i know things romanian ' , nothing more . 
  heck , why would a nationalist even post here , except for - hold on - trolling . 
  now trolling is the dread of all internet forums . 
  identifying as a troll is pretty much like wearing a swastika in the ghetto . 
  you ca n't change your user name now , but the nat'l flag may help when posting in threads like this one . 
  let me pick this up while he 's away . 
  i do n't think anyone considers a hungarian-romanian union seriously . 
  it would be awfully impractical , romanians being about twice as many as hungarians . 
  also consider the language difference , romanian is a romance language with a considerable slavic influx , hungarian is not even indoeuropean - how do you get a common administration to work ? 
  health , law , education , tax forms ... we are having lots of problems with this as is in the bilingual areas . 
  and there is of course the historical animosity . 
  however , op 's question is ` very hypothetical ' ( in their own words ) . 
  in an ideal world , where good intentions lead to good results only , such an union _ might _ , hypothetically , obsolete the groups of morons ( on both sides ) that hold hands and sing `` we hate you '' around the fire . 
  i do n't know b 's reasons and i wo n't put words in his mouth , but as far as i am concerned , 1000 years of hatred should be enough for everyone . 
  a hungarian-romanian union is probably unfeasible , but the idea expresses the above frustration . 
  well , it does imply trolling , which , unlike sexual preference , is relevant here . 
  you could perhaps wear your national flag , it would help avoid confusions , at least in discussions like this one . 
  if we all wore the eu flag in / r/europe , it would become somewhat moot . 
  i believe the serbian-romanian border is the one frontier in europe that was never disputed , although there are minorities living in both countries . 
  there is considerable sympathy towards serbs in romania ( not sure about the opposite ) . 
  i do n't know why . 
  i suppose we happened to share friends and enemies along all our common history . 
  i suppose he is referring to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) . 
   japan well , that 's a relief , 
  romanians . 
  well , nobody else speaks it . 
  ` europe . 
  indeed , gentlemen ' . 
  and the lowest paid will pay more ( 22 % instead of 18 ) . 
  dude . 
  occupation is not protection , period . 
  those `` little nations '' , in your condescending style , got the same `` protection '' from the soviets . 
  i do n't understand how the habsburg monarchy `` aroused genuine affection among its citizens '' . 
  perhaps the author misread the good soldier svejk . 
  heck , austria-hungary produced kafka , for crying out loud . 
  as for `` provided a home for the small nations of europe who would have difficulty surviving alone '' ( by ocupation , no less ) see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria-hungary#ethnic_relations, 
  very bad economic record from the previous administration . 
  alright . 
  brothers / cousins then ? 
  i never meant it like that !, 
  i actually made friends with two kids from lodz ( sp ? ) . 
  i was just trying to show how stereotypes change ... 
   i 'm not sure about `` ungur '' though . 
  i think it existed alongside `` maghiar '' all the time . 
  in ardeal , perhaps . 
  i do n't think the term ` maghiar ' had any circulation in either moldavia or valahia . 
  i found miron costin at wikisource . 
  in the [ letopiset ] ( http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/letopise%c8%9bul_%c8%9a%c4%83r%c3%aei_moldovei_de_la_aaron_vod%c4%83_%c3%aencoace ) and [ de neamul moldovenilor ] ( http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/de_neamul_moldovenilor ) _ combined _ , there is a single instance of the word ` maghiar ' ( in the latter ) , while ungur and family - 126 . 
  so it 's safe to say that , while ~ ~ neculce ~ ~ costin knew the endonym , he much preferred the local exonym . 
  also , ` ungurean ' , meaning ` from the country of the unguri ' , was used instead of ardelean . 
  ( edit ) : here 's the context for that unique mention of ` maghiar ' :  a\u0219a toate neamurile supt\u016d multe numere toate sunt\u016d . 
  ungurii : huni , maghiari , ugrii ( all peoples are known under many names . 
  the hungarians ( ungurii ) : huns , magyars , ugri ) yes , he definitely knew the endonym , but only used ` ungur ' himself . 
  what , illicit trade ? 
   but now romania has bad pr in poland these things change all the time , in the 80s the poles had bad pr in romania because they `` invaded '' all summer resorts and tried to sell all sorts of watches , bracelets and such . 
  thirty years later , and nobody remembers . 
  ` german ' is a 19th century [ import ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/german/498194 ) . 
  the traditional word is the slavic one , e.g. 
  piatra neamt ( a place name presumably related to teutonic knights that had lived in the area in the 13th century ) . 
   the countryside brings figures down . 
  definitely . 
  i 'd be really interested to see a breakdown by area in romania . 
  bucharest is filled with overweight young people , the deadly sedentary job / fast food combo . 
  i suppose he is referring to places like [ this ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.438407,26.139028&amp;spn=0.011629,0.026157&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.438487,26.138975&amp;panoid=sams7j67leab2__md1vaea&amp;cbp=12,236.17,,0,-4.18 ) , they are all over the place , including the very center of bucharest ( no street view though , for some reason ) . 
  however , we do get fresh vegetables in supermarkets as well ( no `` organic '' food yet ) . 
  it 's more complicated than that , but it still involves iliescu & gang . 
  they were , for instance , opposed to `` pluripartitism '' ( another word for democracy ) in early 1990 , claiming that democracy may exist within a single party , and it took huge pressure from the population ( 12-28 jan ) for them to allow legalization of other parties . 
  in the aftermath of the events of 13-15 june 1990 , piata universitatii was occupied again ( june 17 ) , which eventually led to the legalization of independent radio / tv ( the second demand in the original pu manifesto , after `` lustration '' ) . 
  and they did a hell of a job in delaying any political or economical modernization , for years . 
  only after 1996 , when they temporarily lost power , did romania regain any political credibility , but that administration was an economical disaster . 
  export it already !, 
   siliste means `` the place where once was a village '' or were is a village ? 
  [ both ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/sili%c8%99te/842823 ) , but the word is out of use . 
  it exists only in [ place names ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morome%c8%9bii ) . 
  interestingly , the only ones starting in a * p * are breton , welsh , and romanian . 
  i really meant the word * ora\u0219 * ... 
   the ultimate magyar revenge hey , we 're the ones that gained something from it :p, 
  extra bonus : the now obsolete romanian word * t\u00e2rgove\u021b * means * city dweller * ( or\u0103\u0219an ) . 
  i always thought they were built upon [ rivers of the same name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bistri%c8%9ba ) ? 
  ps : thanks for the breath of old reddit , 
  good point , but it does n't contradict my theory   the name was used by the slavs to locate the ruins of the old roman fortifications . 
  * bistri\u021ba * in romanian , a slavic word meaning * quick * and used exclusively for rivers and creeks . 
  as an anecdote , there are two rivers in romania named * humor * , one is an affluent of a [ * bistri\u021ba * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humor_river_%28bistri%c8%9ba%29 ) , the other of [ * moldova * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humor_river_%28moldova%29 ) . 
  the name * humor * is a romanization of the old hungarian * hamar * , meaning * quick * . 
  * moldova * itself descends from a slavic word of germanic origin , * moldau * , meaning quick/troubled water , which is one of the names of [ * vltava * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vltava#etymology ) . 
  i 've spent an hour or so looking into it , and it 's quite interesting . 
  pie ** \u01f5\u02b0er - * ( enclosure ) seems to have evolved differently between slavs ( - gra - ) and the other ie languages ( - gar - ) . 
  we have words from both paths , latin * curte * as well as slavic * ograda * ( [ yard ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=yard ) ) , local * gard * ( fence , see [ hurdle ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hurdle ) ) and slavic * gr\u0103din\u0103 * ( [ garden ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=garden ) ) . 
  wiktionary also lists ancient greek [ * \u03c7\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%cf%87%cf%8c%cf%81%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%82#ancient_greek ) ( feeding enclosure for animals ) which translates to * \u021barc * ( cognate with albanian * thark * ) . 
  so romanian equivalents of vi\u0219egrad ( or akropolis , for that matter ) should end not in - grad , but in something like - garda . 
  in fact , they * should n't * , because we do n't use that word order ; vi\u0219egrad would have given grad vyssokiy , or something like that . 
  and this implies that slavic influx ^ * to proto-romanian happend when no - and ceased before any - significant fortifications existed in the area . 
  some that did pre-exist were briefly called - grad , but by the time local political power was consolidated enough as to afford their own , they were called in non-slavic manner , curtea ( ~ court ) de arge\u0219 , cetatea ( ~ [ fortified ] city ) sucevei , piatra ( ~ stone ) neam\u021b , turnu ( ~ tower ) , turnu severin , turnu m\u0103gurele , etc. 
  ^ * meaning influence on everyday language between populations in contact . 
  * slavonic * influence , from the * lingua franca * of the time and area , which was old bulgarian , continued for several centuries for upper classes , but i am talking about words like * gr\u0103din\u0103 * ( very much alive ) , not * blagoslovenie * . 
   fraport ag taking over 14 airports in deal worth $ 1.23 bn that is among requirements as greece receives billions in loans to keep it afloat you are correct .
