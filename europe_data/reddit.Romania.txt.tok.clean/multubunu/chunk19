   the security of my country ( and its northeastern neighbours ) . 
  like scotland ? 
  there are limits to cynicism . 
  you could at least pick up after your dog . 
   the bolsheviks did n't target individual enemies , but social . 
  and i had to go through all the page to find this at the bottom . 
  exactly !, 
  the nazi doctrine was race-based , so they targeted a race . 
  the commies were about class struggle , so they targeted a class . 
  both targeted large groups of people with the expressed intention to eliminate them . 
  i 'd say it 's a way to say thanks for the * big thumbs up * , 
  looks like a pretty woman hugging a big thumb that is up . 
  there is a slavic element , for instance in palatalizing d , t , n before e , i. 
  also , * ia * instead of * ea * , as in * niagr\u0103 * instead of * neagr\u0103 * . 
  this is particularly strong in banat ( * fruncia * , eh ? 
  ) , where the accent is reminiscent of serbian . 
  how 's intrakom doing these days ? 
  that 's not the isis salute , the palm must face forward , [ like this ] ( http://i.ndtvimg.com/mt/2013-01/queen.jpg ) . 
  say that with a [ fresh quote ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askanthropology/comments/3ekgih/are_the_people_of_greece_today_the_same_ethnic/#ctfxecl ) from / r/askanthropology . 
  tl ; dr :  central asia played a genetic role , but that the modern composition is largely indigenous . 
  there were in fact a number of games that focused on seafaring ( [ wolfpack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfpack_%28video_game%29 ) comes to mind , there were others ) . 
  the article 's subject could be well developed in a d&d style game - and it seems [ it already has been ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=game+stowaway&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cd4qsarqfqotcodr1fxe58ycfci5faodmtaasa&amp;biw=1760&amp;bih=934 ) ( but i lost contact with video games a while ago ) . 
   it was piigs it was pigs [ with ireland being added later ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigs_%28economics%29 ) . 
  and gipsi was a thing [ a couple of years ago ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/?_r=0 ) . 
  [ a great incentive for tourism .

   soviet government also did many positive things , but you should really ask the people who are upset , not me . 
  perhaps those positive things were geared towards those presently upset ? 
  but i should really ask the people who are n't upset , not you . 
   i just like the idea of historical tweets . 
   `` forcibly '' as in `` as a condition to enter a programme which greece * wants * to enter '' ? 
  no , forcibly '' as in `` a condition to enter a programme which greece * has no option but * to enter '' . 
  of course . 
  what is gross - in my opinion - is forcibly taking it as a collateral . 
  islands and ruins ? 
  who on earth came up with that ? 
  i doubt there is no provision in the greek constitution against selling territory . 
  as for the monuments , they have a lot more value for the locals than for anybody else . 
  maintenance for large scale monuments has to be more expensive than any revenue from tickets ... 
  i suppose those ` assets ' would have been something more easily monetized , like the subway in athens or some naval facilities . 
  it 's still gross to ask for , but at least it would make sense financially . 
  it looks like a road sign . 
   it is the greek people who are to blame . 
  corruption was endemic and institutional the funny thing about endemic * anything * is that , as a subject , you do n't realize it 's there . 
  the perception is not like * this is wrong , why do n't we stop * , more like * this is normality * . 
  not an excuse , merely an explanation . 
  neither were used by politicians , but by the press/blogs . 
  they make no sense in romanian , so they did n't get much traction here . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/opinion/krugman-what-ails-europe.html ) from the new york times . 
  it had a brief career a couple of years ago , here 's a [ random page from google ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/12/201212392653337846.html ) . 
   i 've left the `` us '' vague on purpose coud you clarify if it includes people using such terms as piigs and gipsi and * lazy greeks * ? 
  ( honestly curious , we have the same debate over and over for the romanian equivalent ), 
   they have grown up indoctrinated on a socialist economic ideal let me add a little nuance to that . 
  the whole economy was * designed * in a way that could n't fit a free market . 
  for instance you would have institutions ( called * centrale * ) whose sole purpose was to direct economic activity in a given domain ( like precision mechanics ) . 
  all planning , production , trade , investment had to go through those - and managers in the actual factories had no idea how to do things otherwise . 
  and , of course , there was no experience with marketing that would fit a free market . 
  this has nothing to do with ideals , it 's just that a planned economy is fundamentally incompatible with a free market and the industries were sufficiently developed in that direction that most of them were not redeemable , especially given the patent lack of understanding of the new economic paradigm . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/wiki/travel props to / u/magicsebi for putting this up . 
   sous-jailu should n't that be * sous-jlailu * ? 
   anyway , congrats on on your new position !, 
   there 's literally zero reason why russia would invade . 
  nobody is suggesting russia would invade ireland , northern or otherwise . 
  not at first , anyway . 
  but this is not about what reason russia would have to do this or that , but the reasons why we in eastern europe are weary , while you crack popcorn in the comfort of your armchair and wax philosophical about what oughta be . 
  the text is a summary of their political activity , beginning with the year of the candidate 's birth . 
   russia as well , i doubt it ooh , thanks !, 
  i feel * so * much better now . 
  seriously though . 
  your main concern is fear-mongering by your media ; ours is being beaten to death like my grandpa . 
  history is not deemed to repeat itself unless people learn nothing from it . 
  that 's the germans for you . 
   w\u0142och compare with vlach , valach , olah , waloon , welsch and welsh - all descended from an old german word meaning [ * foreigner * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walhaz ) and used to designate romanized populations . 
   like `` limba '' , which means `` language '' both in romanian and sardinian i guess it 's best translated by * tongue * , it has both meanings ( i think * lingua * does too ) . 
  maybe you shit gold ? 
  holy cow , did you flush it down the toilet all your life ? 
  that is actually a line presented as a russian proverb in a russian ( soviet ? ), 
  novel , named * port arthur * - a fictionalized story of the 1904-1905 russian-japanese war , as seen from the [ besieged port ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_port_arthur ) . 
  when the [ petropavlovsk dreadnought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_battleship_petropavlovsk_%281894%29 ) goes under after hitting a mine , the respected [ admiral makarov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepan_makarov ) drowns , while some archduke is found floating , mostly due to his nobility cape . 
  some sailor utters that line , presumably as folk wisdom . 
  i read that as i child and i ca n't remember the author . 
  adaptation to troubled waters . 
  shit floats , gold sinks . 
  you are certainly correct , i will just add that , in my experience , people or organizations who choose such names as mothers against drunk driving , people 's democratic republic , or / u/concernedcitizen2015 usually have an unspoken agenda hidden behind , and distinct of the emotional self-description . 
  the [ first pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dljpsig.jpg ) is actually of [ massacred armenians ] ( https://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/armenian-genocide/ ) - picture by [ armin wegner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armin_t._wegner ) . 
  * palm sunday * , really , but where palm branches are unavailable people use other trees ' branches , like willow . 
  for us it 's flower day ( * florii * ) , which also serves as name day for people named after flowers - florea , florin , floarea , florentina , or margareta ( daisy ) , violeta , camelia , etc.

  i call it bipolar narcissism . 
  he seems right about the * gold * coins , which [ per wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koson_%28coin%29 ) are of a single type . 
  however , lesser value coins , mostly imitations of greek/roman originals , [ seem to have seen plenty of use ] ( http://www.romanianhistoryandculture.com/getiananddaciankings.htm#688034605 ) . 
  not the same , * h * in czech sort of stands for * g * - e.g. 
  compare * hora * to * gora * ( both meaning mountain ) . 
  so if it was the same word , jilava would have been jiglava . 
  * jilav * ( meaning * damp * ) is indeed a slavic word , but unrelated to * jihlava * , where the * hlava * part probably stands for * head * or something similar . 
  pix or gtfo . 
   a war ? 
  that would be madness !, 
  yes , it is . 
  i have no idea how many you are your side of the screen , so i 'll leave that at that .
