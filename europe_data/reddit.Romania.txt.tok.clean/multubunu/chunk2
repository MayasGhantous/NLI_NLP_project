   a sick man a * deranged * person . 
  in this context * bolnav * ( sick , ill ) translates to * mentally ill * . 
  i certainly remember the last time a certain `` great '' nation in the area lost contact with reality and crumbled all by itself . 
   just another excuse for a new ** warsaw ** pact . 
  not needed , we already have nato . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_romanian_protests_against_the_ro%c8%99ia_montan%c4%83_project ) , as it 's a really long story . 
  that 's how the man rolls . 
  some said that with the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 controversy , he managed to pull a 900 \u00b0 turn ( aka five times 180 \u00b0 ) . 
   but the majority of nato members , especially germany , are opposed to the proposal , warning that it could result in an ** unnecessary provocation ** of moscow . 
  provocation ? 
  i 'd say it would be a * response * , reactive , not proactive ... 
   horse meat being worked into the beef we import actually , a certain jan fasen ( of dutch nationality ) was in the supply chain , who had been involved in horse-meat fraud as early as 2007 :  [ the dutch trader ran a company called draap , which spelled backwards is * paard * or dutch for horse . 
  it was registered in cyprus in 2008 , with an offshore vehicle in the british virgin islands . 
  it emerged during fasen 's trial in holland that he had supplied french companies with horsemeat imported from south america and mexico ** fraudulently labelled as dutch and german `` beef '' ** going back to 2007 . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/15/horsemeat-scandal-the-essential-guide ) so the label might be misleading ... 
  actually , there is some debate among historians . 
  the guy was certainly hated by many , despite the very short time he was in power , and it 's not that clear why . 
  the legend surrounding his cruelty is clearly exaggerated ( he did n't have the physical time to kill 40,000 people , for instance ) , and is perhaps due to the fact that he had a habit of antagonizing everybody . 
  the impalings were not necessarily an execution method either , it may have been simply a method of * exposing * dead bodies ( impalings are documented as a way to put people to death in later periods , including an account of someone who lived for hours , and was talking to his family while suspended , but that 's a century or two later ) . 
  also , contemporary drawings show people impaled in the middle of their backs , not crotches , and lying somewhat horizontally c. giur\u0103scu ( * istoria rom\u00e2nilor * ) makes the case for the guy being a geek , e.g. 
  keeping count of people killed in battle ( i killed 827 turks and i know that because i had their heads severed and counted ) , while his contemporaries , while equally merciless ( e.g. 
  having someone 's limbs tied to four horses and flog the animals ) , were less interested in the statistics . 
  and nobody loves geeks . 
  nope , but we have the one [ lying down ] ( http://www.bogdancostea.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_2246.jpg ) , you could add it to the post . 
  some pics [ here ] ( http://www.ziaristionline.ro/2011/03/03/caderea-lui-lenin-bucuresti-3-martie-1990-istoria-fotografiata-de-dinu-lazar/ ) from the taking down , march 3rd 1990 . 
  i 'm somewhere in the crowd , 
  neither could academia vasilian\u0103 ( ia\u0219i , 1634 ) nor academia domneasc\u0103 ( or sf . 
  well ... 
  ours is bigger :p, 
  your apples were banned before it was cool . 
  neither would be / r/rogonewild . 
  on the other hand , / r/rogentlemanboners is rather active , [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/rogentlemanboners/comments/2asms3/doar_zic/ ) a pic of our finance minister , for instance ( her harvard phd is not mentioned , but real nonetheless ) . 
  * eastern * poland , i hear it 's an el dorado waiting to happen . 
  le : i guess i really need to start using smileys :(, 
  if you get to sit , they 're actually * more * comfortable - five chairs in the same space as six in the new ones . 
  also , i 've been using those for longer than some people have been around , so yeah , i 'd * hate * to see them go  an outsider , though - and we are on / r/europe - will more likely see the objective drawbacks , the noise , the lack of air conditioning which calls for open windows which brings more noise etc. 
  that 's not a bus , that 's the mayor 's office , says right upfront . 
  you must be a regular on tramclub.org ... 
  i 'm late to the party , i 'll leave this here anyway . 
  there are actually two types of trains in the bucharest subway , the new imported ones ( pictured ) and the old ones , locally produced and rather old , noisy and uncomfortable . 
  the old ones have been vandalized by graffers for a long time , but at some point the company stopped cleaning them , as the decorations got better ( the new ones are actively protected / cleaned up ) . 
  at some point , the company even * sponsored * the painting of at least one , [ here are the results ] ( http://bucuresti.tourneo.ro/de-ziua-internationala-a-apei-s-a-vopsit-metroul_7780.html ) . 
  he forgot to mention that the subway thing became a meme on romanian language subreddits , it 's used tongue-in-cheek by both sides , just like / u/waterfuck above , who is from cluj . 
  another one is * cluj master race * , in case it pops up here and raises eyebrows . 
  it 's just a joke . 
   it did n't look so big it has been built to look smaller , more at the scale of the city . 
  it 's not obvious because it is surrounded by a lot of space , so you ca n't get close enough to see how big [ those arched windows ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/5jipl ) really are , and the proportions are those of a more normal building . 
  i got this from a guy who worked at the mock-up during construction . 
  amongst other things , he mentioned that [ at least ] one of the floors was 18m high - about ~ ~ three ~ ~ * six * floors of a regular block of flats . 
  well , there 's also the small issue of earnings ... 400euros/month net average here . 
  you still have it better , supposing the netherlands are above 1200 , 
  a common problem with high speed connections . 
  neither was it independent ( de jure ) or part of the independent state of russia - it was a part of the russian empire up until 1920 or so . 
  following the `` departure '' of moldova in 1918 ( in accordance with lenin 's version of the self-determination principle ) the soviets invented the moldavian autonomous ssr approximately on the current transnistrian territory , with no historical reason , apparently to justify territorial claims on present day moldova . 
  the territory of the republic of moldova is the part of the historical principalty of moldova that was conquered by the russian empire in 1812/1877 , while the remainder was the initiator and co-founder state of romania . 
  the moldavian assr was extened with present-day moldova ( and renamed moldavian ssr ) after conquest of that territory in 1940/1944 . 
  there 's two types , the soviet and russian stereotypes . 
  the russian type is drunks , the other , well there are several . 
  here 's a russian one : ivan gets drunk , goes to sleep on the rails , he gets hit by a train . 
  after months in hospital , he comes home and natasha goes on to make him some tea . 
  after a while , the samovar starts puffing , and ivan , in a rage , throughs the thing out the window . 
  \\ - what 's up with you ?? 
  \\ - these things are dangerous when they grow up !, 
   we also have jokes about moldovans , hungarians and russians . 
  you forgot the ardeleni and the olteni ... ( people living in the nw and sw of romania ) here 's one for taste : in oltenia they were getting pissed off by the smugness of the ardeleni , so they spent a lot of money to erect a huge poster on the northern slopes of the carpathians that read : ` the ardeleni are stupid ' . 
  seeing that , the ardeleni gathered , discussed and planned carefully and finally erected a huge poster on the southern slopes of the carpathians , that read : ` no , you ! ', 
  they had a flash-referendum , 123 % voted on the apple ban . 
   do n't say that palinka is bad no argument there , 
  if you think of it , it 's a poetic and expanded version of the phrase * wake up sheeple * . 
  also , you can play most of it in minor chords , which is pretty unexpected from an anthem . 
  one of my favourite european anthems . 
  actually , i find the romanian version better ( and i understand french ) . 
  in english , it would go something like : * stand up , you forsaken by life , * * you , the sentenced to hunger - stand !, 
  * * may revolt boil in our hearts * * may nightfall come to the old world . 
  * * lets join the great fight * * let slave join slave * * the international * * through us we shall make . 
  * it does n't work that well in english , mostly from a lack of imperative , also there are no neologisms in the romanian version - and i could n't make it rhyme , but i think i managed to convey the passion in the text . 
  this said - not a fan of the red flag either . 
  it 's also the first road sign i 've seen that includes smileys ( not that i do n't like it ) . 
  i am not sure about the last paragraph , i just saw it in a sticky somewhere . 
  le : i just created an alt and i do n't see any local subreddit ( or / r/europe ) in the * my subreddits * list , so that was wrong . 
  it 's top/left , but you can only see it if you are logged ** out ** . 
  the geodefault thingie is intended only for people not logged in . 
   getting defaulted is usually a bad thing in my experience . 
  this is not a true default - if i understand correctly - rather the sub will show on your front page if 1 . you are in europe 2 . you are logged ** out ** . 
  ~ ~ i am also under the impression that new subscribers will see the local subreddit ( if it participates in the program ) in their subreddit list . ~ ~, 
  for the folks that - like me - missed the `` p. martin '' bit , [ here it is ] ( http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.ro/2014/07/launch-location-detected-of-missile.html ) . 
  we shall fight for peace until no brick is left on another !, 
   or that this guy is a shill/fake/something perhaps he is . 
  he is anonymous and untraceable , and his tale is very convenient * for russia * , with all the recent stories of buks being transported over the border ; now you have a weak source claiming it was the local militia who shot the plane . 
  although even * this * story leaves room for the buk and operators being russian military ... 
  i think the point of the cartoon is that putin shoots anything indiscriminately . 
  there 's various trophies of protected animals , including a panda ... 
   but once that territorial integrity has already been broken , i wonder what her tune will be . 
  it 's a complicated and unprecedented matter , i doubt she herself knows what her tune will be , should we get there . 
  she did just that :  merkel on friday said she did n't want to get involved in what was a internal political discussion in spain , spain 's el mundo newspaper reported . 
  but when she was asked specifically about policy on secession , she gave a clear answer :  `` we ( the german government ) defend the territorial integrity of all of ( european union ) member states , which is something completely different from the independence of a region , '' said merkel ** in response to a question ** about a planned november 9th vote on the issue of independence in the spanish region of catalonia . 
  she did n't * speak out * , as the title says . 
  russia is concerned they might lose allies , so they ban imports from those countries ( for health reasons , ofc ) . 
  makes one wonder why nobody in the neighborhood wants to be friends with russia . 
   moldovona call it moldovan language not any more :  [ at official level , while the name `` moldovan '' is still prescribed by article 13 of the current constitution , [ 3 ] the constitutional court interpreted in 2013 that this article is superseded by the declaration of independence of moldova , [ 4 ] thus giving official status to the `` romanian '' language .
