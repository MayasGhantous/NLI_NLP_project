  less and less , apparently . 
   ... but wait ... homicides and suicides are down !, 
  you people should really start a war or something . 
  stand up , you damned of the earth , awaken proletariat - at 6:00 am , so you can be at your designated place at 7:00 , where the man with the pen will check your name on the list . 
  there are no supreme saviours , no god , nor caesar , nor tribune - so show your allegiance to the party leadership , carry their pictures while you march for hours , until you reach the stands where they will wave down to you from their chairs . 
  pay attention to the man with the list , he will cue the wise slogans that you will be shouting joyously . 
  now you 're done , so walk home , as there 's only enough buses for the men with the lists . 
  but rejoice !, 
  tomorrow you will be working harder , to compensate for the lovely holiday . 
   uk media needs to stop using them as a scapegoat . 
  i have only just returned from winchester , england . 
  the only two romanians i 've met there were working , a receptionist at my hotel and a waitress who was a student but needed the work . 
  there 's beggars on high street , including one lady carrying a toddler , none of them romanian ( or roma , for that matter ) . 
  plenty of garbage flying around , in the cathedral yard even . 
  cigarette butts all over the pavement , i say this as a chain smoker that does smoke on the street , but holds the butt till finding a litter box . 
  the cab that took me back to heathrow did not give me a proper receipt , so my employer will not reimburse me the 75 pounds . 
  and i specifically asked for one when i ordered the car one day before . 
  i was also assured that i could pay by card , which misteriously did n't work on his system , though it did at the shady atm he took me to - which did not give a receipt . 
  not a romanian ... 
  this is not to say the english are bad , on the contrary , and i even made a couple of friends . 
  but shitty people are everywhere , they 're like a nation of their own , and yes , some of them come from romania . 
  deal with it . 
  would czesko have worked ? 
  perhaps . 
  but avarice is everywhere . 
   nobody wears a fez today , yes . 
  they were still in use up to the early seventies among the turkish community in romania . 
  you can see some [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/kmwyjnusm5a?t=550 ) , although those are probably a `` tourist attraction '' thing . 
  but i do remember some people genuinely wearing them in mangalia , and you could even buy a fez , they looked just like in the film and were made of a rolled cardboard sheet dressed in red cloth . 
  interesting . 
  this works for * inima * as well . 
  which one of them means * heart * ? 
   it may be due to the relative isolation of the roman-speaking communities it 's more complicated than that , * inima * for instance was never used in other romance languages . 
  / u/lasulinainport has a briliant write-out [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/46qjy3/welcome_rcanada_today_we_are_hosting_rcanada_for/d08vbnl ) . 
  another interesting thing : in romanian , like in slavic languages , the word for * world * originally meant * light * - however , in romanian it is derived from the * latin * word . 
  wait till you see the verbs :  [ a full classification , considering all combinations of sound changes and ending patterns , contains about seventy types , not including irregular verbs . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_verbs ), 
  sort of . 
  it is very close to * pul\u0103 * meaning * dick * , so if * little johnny * has the same implication , then yes . 
  lenin is humane - he thinks of the children . 
  what was the happiest day of your life ? 
  american : my neighbour had this great car , i worked my ass off and bought an even better one ( replace with chevrolet and whatnot ) , and that day was the happiest day of my life . 
  french : my neighbour had this great wife , it took a lot of effort , but i finally got to sleep with her , and that day was the happiest day of my life . 
  soviet : one night at three a.m. there was loud banging on my door . 
  i dressed up , took the bag with the winter clothes , some canned fish i was keeping in the balcony , and all the cigarettes in the house , opened the door : four guys in black leather jackets . 
  ivan ivanovitch ? 
  and then i said : no , the apartment above ; and that was the happiest day of my life . 
   the lives of others seconded . 
  such a great movie . 
  no , that does n't work in romanian . 
  this one in particular comes from a standup comedian , mircea cri\u0219an , that emigrated in the late sixties and had shows at voa and rfe . 
  the dumb pomposity and wooden-tongue accents are lost in most of them ... 
  it mimics a time announcement , e.g. 
  at the fifth beep it will be exactly 11 hours . 
  in this case , there are exactly five drops of hot water , which is delivered in a centralized fashion , city-wide central heating , to each block of flats ; that system still exists , though people are disconnecting from it and installing apartment-based central heating , and no new developments are built in the old style . 
  on the other hand prizes are usually `` golden '' , e.g. 
  [ the golden bear ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_bear ) , [ the golden globe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_golden_globe ) , or [ the golden lion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venice_film_festival ) . 
  this joke long predates the eu . 
  it is usually attributed to mark twain , [ there are doubts ] ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.usage.english/iwgeazlweqy ) , but the original is still at least from the forties . 
  [ a common mistake ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/07/25/bucharest-not-budapest-romanian-campaign-aims-to-put-an-end-to-the-confusion/ ) . 
  oops  and i went that far as to research a horthy square in bucharest . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  if you want to go deeper in the communist mentality ( and respective humour ) , i highly recommend the works of soviet writers ilf & petrov , notably `` the twelve chairs '' and `` the golden calf '' ( and only after , if you manage , `` america '' ) . 
  whoa , we had that with [ petre roman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petre_roman ) for dolanc after 1990 ( he does have a short neck in reality ) . 
  nice to find out where it originated  here 's a yugoslav joke that was being told in romania : comrade brezhnev has a dream - an angel comes to him and tells him : for the glory of the ussr , you must fly . 
  it is fairly easy , just climb the kremlin , spread you arms and jump , you will be flying in no time . 
  brezhnev is reluctant , but after the dream repeats three nights and the angel gets angry that he 's not following , leonid eventually climbs the kremlin , spreads his arms wide , and jumps - to his death . 
  once in heaven , st. peter is rather surprised : comrade , we expected you only years from now , what happened ? 
  \\ - well you see , there was this angel you sent that kept pushing me to learn to fly . 
  st. peter looks around , and , sure enough , there 's an angel snickering behind a column . 
  so he scalds him : \\ - you merely got here and started on pranks !, 
  not nice , tito ... 
  i think this is from a book by marin preda : political jokes were called * 3/7 jokes * - three years who listens , seven who tells . 
  that is a [ mircea cri\u0219an ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/mircea_cri%c8%99an ) joke , probably spread through the voice of america radio station , where he had a show . 
  i quoted another one on this page ( the one with socialism versus jesus ) . 
  another one i remember , but can not translate :  tot \u00eenainte !, 
  * always forward !, 
  * ( children 's organization slogan ) * because it was better before * ( * \u00eenainte * can mean both forward and before ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a soviet joke , as many jokes on this page . 
  the soviets had some 20 years headstart , and many jokes were `` portable '' enough . 
  the baffling question is how did these jokes propagate . 
  it was n't easy to travel , at some times - even within ones own country , and those who managed to would have been cautious enough as to avoid sharing that type of humour . 
  it 's really too bad there was n't a study on this , i guess it may have shed some light on the distribution of languages in the world , of myths , etc. 
  in cs you are not prevented to speak freely , but will be locked up for exercising that right . 
  they pretend to pay us , we pretend to work . 
  we had the first one with ceau\u0219escu . 
  do n't step on the flowers . 
  they 're philips . 
  there is nothing offensive in that joke . 
  speaking about the pope , i 'll try to translate this one . 
  in romanian the pope is called papa . 
  this plays on * two * alternate meanings : * papa * is kid 's word for food , while * pa * is an informal * bye * . 
  - so , why did the pope never visit romania ? 
  - because the acclamations would have been unacceptable - '' * ceau\u0219escu , pa-pa !, 
  these do n't work too well in english : the ceau\u0219escu 's are discussing legislation : - nicolae : leano , what is this law of universal gravity , i do n't remember passing it ? 
  - elena : how should i know , laws are your department ; i 'm a scientist . 
  ceau\u0219escu applies for the nobel for physics , having discovered the propagation of darkness at the speed of light . 
  when ceau\u0219escu started demolishing the old center of bucharest it was speculated that , having failed to go down in history , he aimed at geography next . 
  jesus christ fed the masses with a few loaves and fish . 
  the socialist regime has proved it can do even better .
