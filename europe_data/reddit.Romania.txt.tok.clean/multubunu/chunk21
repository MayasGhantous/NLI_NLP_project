  bul\u0103 is walking on the street , a box of a4 paper in his hand . 
  a friend stops him : - hey , can you spare a few sheets , i need some for school ? 
  these are manifestos . 
  - but ... they 're blank sheets ? 
  - nobody needs it spelled out . 
  bul\u0103 is going to the school band show , violin box in his hand . 
  he opens the box and takes out a machine gun . 
  everybody throw themselves to the ground , and the headmaster asks : - bul\u0103 , what ... what are you doing with a machine gun at a concert ? 
  - me , nothing ... wonder what dad will be doing with a violin at the party congress . 
  they probably changed the title . 
  the url suggests it was initially very different : http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2016/02/09/why-ring-fencing-greece-from-europe-wont-solve-anything/, 
   \u0447\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448 ok , that was [ a surprise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciuca%c8%99_peak ) . 
  there 's [ a beer ] ( http://media.iqads.ro/2014/05/ciucas-sa-inceapa-relaxarea-cover-800.jpg ) , too . 
  * a zbura * versus * a vrea * / * a voi * ( yep , two of them , latin and slavic ) . 
  no parallels here . 
  vol does not exist in romanian , that was the point i was making . 
  nope , that would be * zbor * for * vol * . 
  still a descendant of * vol * , with the z a vestige of an * ex * prefix . 
   hungary well , you have austria-hungary in wwi then [ the 1919 war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian%e2%80%93romanian_war ) then wwii , so they win . 
  also , we may have been at war with the ottomans in wwi , but there was no actual fighting . 
  i was looking deeper into it and found [ \u0218\u0103ineanu ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/codru/792443 ) having it derived from a word for mountain ( akin to albanese * codr\u0103 * , a hill ) , that was used in banat and in aromanian - and this makes for a fascinating link to bulgarian , where * gora * = * forrest * used to mean * mountain * ( an still does in various slavic languages ) . 
  then i noticed that der mentions the obsolete meaning of * mountain * as well . 
  codru is really weird because it 's supposed to come from a word meaning * quarter * , and the word is used meaning * piece * ( un codru de p\u00e2ine ) . 
  the der dances elegantly around the subject , but leaves the question open , i.e. 
  * codru * = * woods * is of unclear origin . 
  in classical latin , yes . 
  vulgar latin had it and it propagated to [ italian ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/padule ) as * padule * and romanian as * p\u0103dure * . 
   boschet [ french loanword ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/boschet ) . 
  we do have * codru * , * cr\u00e2ng * , * dumbrav\u0103 * ... 
  it was n't * cyrillic * per se , but an adapted form . 
  the older latin-based alphabets did have diphtongs ( e.g. 
  * \u00e9 * for * ea * ) and `` short vowels '' ( \u016d , \u012d ) , the current one was introduced in 1904 , apparently at public request .

   ** emilian sava ** , one of the people who assisted in the original removal , saw the negative reactions to his work and had a major change of heart . 
  he vowed to the people in a facebook apology that he would give them a bigger , better snow penis . 
  romanian guy . 
  in varietate concordia . 
  we 're only second to poland in eastern europe . 
  i would have expected we lag hungary or the czech republic . 
  one could argue that it was during the cold war , with the us taking the leadership position for western europe , so maybe people would have wanted it anyway . 
  man ... 
  i 'm not * concerned * or anything . 
  i 'm just spending jan 1-st at home , with a bit of good food , good wine , and good company - the latter from reddit . 
  we wo n't be fixing the world , not today . 
  there 's plenty wrong , some with russia and its external politics , some with the rest of the world . 
  what we can do is * talk * about it , hopefully our opinions will reflect in our respective governments ' . 
  probably not . 
  but debate requires calm if anything is going to come from it . 
  calling people names does n't help , on the contrary . 
  and i 'm not a good person , neither are you ; nobody is . 
  it 's not about being good , it 's about being pragmatic , which means being rational - nothing wrong with passion , as long it does n't degenerate in antagonism and destroys your argument in the process . 
  happy new year , 
   in addition to your empathy . 
  aww , dude , you are killing me  no , really , can you utter a phrase without being `` sarcastic '' ? 
  there is value in what you are trying to say , it just gets lost in all the edginess . 
  i 'll drink this glass of wine to your health . 
  friends ? 
   ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ troll, 
   if i was angry i 'd call it by a normal reddit name - a circlejerk but the freethinkers are cute so it 's lemmings . 
  i do appreciate your most genuine concern for my well being . 
  ok , not * angry * - it was just the keyword in the title anyway . 
  but you will agree that you are * emotional * ( while posing as * rational * ) ? 
   i 'm not angry that 's why you call people * lemmings * ? 
  yes , you are angry . 
  chill , it 's just an internet forum . 
  some will think differently than you . 
  the best you can do with that is figure out why . 
  calling them names solves nothing . 
   the only thing it angers is yahoo 's imagination and reddit 's lemmings you 're the angry one here . 
  with the holidays going on i am pretty low on my water intake . 
  ca n't wait for monday . 
  this angers moscow . 
   we need to free frequency bands the frequencies will still be reserved for am communications . 
  also , the whole mw band occupies less than a fifth of an analogue tv channel bandwith , so not much gain there . 
  additionally , those frequecies are fit for long distance propagation , which means a lot of interference if you try to use them `` locally '' e.g. 
  for remote controls . 
   primavera d'hivern : `` winter spring '' . 
  go the extra mile : * first summer of winter * . 
   torta = cake ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turt%c4%83#romanian ) , originally meaning round bread . 
  the uk used to be on top of that list , it only went second during all those ukip campaigns ( i remember commenting on that here ) . 
   russia doesnt recognize any tribunal that could judge it . 
  an interesting point . 
  should they sue and should ukraine be able to bring this matter in that trial , we could see some interesting developments . 
   germany ( meaning bavaria ) and the uk ( meaning england ) are the real reference points in hungary . 
  same here . 
  orban is rarely in the news , most of what i know of him is gathered on r/europe . 
  the discussion was specifically about neighbouring countries , and in our case it 's hungary who is the most developed ; generally speaking , we 're looking towards germany or france . 
   maybe dumb not dumb at all . 
  the e 's in george are only there as `` modifiers '' ; ge is pronounced d\u017e . 
  * that * is dumb ( and it works the same in romanian ) . 
   no one is blaming ethnic hungarians for anything . 
  it is the 64 counties movement that is in question . 
  ... which is an organization of ethnic hungarians . 
  as u/vortalwombat points out above , a terrorist attack from them would be something unheard of yet . 
  that 's a really weird thing to hear , as your comrades would be * sa\u0219i * i.e. 
  of german ethnicity . 
  there were historically no separatist movements in the german minority in transylvania , who even supported the union with romania in 1918 . 
  our current president is one . 
  i would really be interested to hear more about that .
