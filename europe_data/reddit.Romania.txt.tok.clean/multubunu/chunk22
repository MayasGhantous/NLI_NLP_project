  that bloke called archie duke , who ate an austrich cause he was hungry . 
   u/purculesul the magyar hordes , owing to to their obstinate refusal to learn the fair romanian language , are again misguided . 
  * pur culesul * , a noble username , means * the purely reaped * . 
  however , you and your ilk are on the wrong path , as ever since leaving the urals . 
  our hero is *** u/purcelusul *** i.e. 
  * the little piggy * . 
  * barbarians * is shorter . 
  well , i did n't want to go there . 
  i never understood the politics within the hungarians in romania , so i left it to someone in ardeal , 
  i used to know some lipovans in the village of doi mai . 
  never went to their masses , but they showed me a catechism book they were using , written on pergament , and hundreds of years old . 
  it used a very old alphabet that i could barely read ( i can read modern cyrillic ) , similar to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic#/media/file:triod%27_cvetnaja.jpg ) . 
  so yeah , they 're serious about their customs . 
  [ ceang\u0103i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/csangos ) are a group of / related to hungarians , living in moldova ( not the republic ) . 
  [ lipovans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) are russian old believers . 
  [ aromanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians ) are usually seen as a distinct ethnic group . 
   old believers [ lipovans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) form the vast majority of the small russian minority in romania . 
   troll hearts are made of the same ** stone ** they build their bridges out of erm , it 's brown , soft , and it stinks . 
  that 's no stone . 
   raed arafat , the secretary of state for emergency situation here 's an interesting insight : the guy is an md and the initiator of what has become the [ smurd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smurd ) , one of the few institutions that gathered any public trust in romania . 
  attempts to tamper with the workings of that institution led to the demise of a government in 2012 . 
  he is also a syrian of palestinian descent . 
   why destroy frozen sperms/eggs ? 
  presumably they thought it was a genetic condition that could be passed on to descendants . 
  i have a vague recollection of a biology class on genetic disease and the idea was that `` weirdos '' , from transgenders to hermaphrodites to [ serial killers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_r%c3%aemaru ) , all had some defective chromosomes ( if you follow the link to the * clinical lycanthropy * article you will see hints that psychological peculiarities were historically seen as a result of underlying physical conditions ) . 
   romania should leave eu asap . 
  and so should everyone . 
  eu is nothing more than a blue painted warsaw pact . 
  the warsaw pact was a * military * alliance , formed to counteract nato . 
  the soviet-instrumented equivalent to the - proto - eu was the comecon ( known in romania as caer ) . 
  it is not clear from your comment if you want romania to leave nato or the eu , either of which would indeed be an unpopular opinion . 
  also , moldova never * left * romania . 
  the territory was occupied by russia in 1812 then had a brief existence as a standalone state in 1918 , before * joining * romania . 
  the soviets established an autonomous ssr moldavia in what is now transnistria ( i.e. 
  * over the nistru * , the left bank of the river nistru , which was never a part of romania ) to which eastern moldova was joined after 1944 . 
   withdrawing the bid the bid was not withdrawn , romania simply agreed it will be discussed at a later time . 
  `` that thing i quoted '' is cior\u0103nescu 's * dic\u021bionarul etimologic rom\u00e2n * ( which btw is supported by your source ) . 
  if we are to speculate , * v\u00e2lcea * ( dale ) is rather redundant and unnatural , * v\u0103icic\u0103 * is the normal diminutive from * vale * ( compare with * cale * -  * c\u0103icic\u0103 * , not * c\u00e2lcea * ) . 
  it looks more like a feminine noun , like * purcea * from * porc * ( sow < pig ) . 
  and it definitely looks like an archaic male first name , the - ea ending was still common even in the 19th century ( spirea , petrea etc. ) . 
  the rhotacism is irregular , the l -  r transition happens only for intervocalic l ( cu ** l ** us -  cu ** r ** but ca ** l ** care -  c\u0103 ** l ** ca ) . 
  in the case of * v\u00e2rcolac * it 's likely because of the second l that makes * v\u00e2lcolac * sound like mumbling . 
  could you recommend a good online resource for french etymology ? 
  i 've been looking for one since forever , 
  that 's the common noun meaning * dale * . 
  for the toponym :  din sl . 
  : * slavonic vl\u016dk\u016d is at the origin of both toponyms v\u00e2lcea , which in the 12th century belonged to one farca\u0219 ( < hungarian f\u00e1rk\u00e1s `` wolf '' ) , and v\u00e2lcov . 
  * ( [ source ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/v%c3%aercolac/514137 ) ), 
  not sure where you looked , but [ etymonline ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wolf&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) is a really good resource . 
  so 's the less prevalent * v\u00e2lcu * - and the toponimic * v\u00e2lcea * . 
  switzerland is also known as * confederatio helvetica * , whence the ch for car numbers and the . ch internet domain . 
  1945-1990 , why do you ask ? 
   george cross surely you mean george * soros * . 
  top post : https://www.reddit.com/r/russiadenies/comments/578pku/russia_denies_invading_poland_in_1939/ the russian government must be doing it for the lulz , there is no other reasonable explanation . 
   arguing with unruly users ( like myself ) you 're not an unruly user , you 're simply outspoken . 
  as far as i know you , i 'd like to see you more often on / r/romania . 
   poor mods are constantly being accused of pushing some agenda https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jnocp6wefo4hzdt2-wnk9hcmzb3iawnz4vsqqmemp10.png you make do , or you give up . 
   i support orban and disagree with merkel that 's your opinion , it 's all good . 
  be civil about it and you 'll be alright . 
  bring valid arguments and you 'll start a useful discussion . 
  these boards are discussion forums , whatever contributes is welcome , whatever hinders discussion , like insults and spam , are subject to moderation . 
  i was n't about to , although i get a lot of that myself , 
  being a moderator does not preclude being a user . 
  if it 's not green , it 's fair game . 
   than * then * !, 
   and yes , i think so . 
   i know plenty of people who [ do ] for the record , i do n't consider myself a nationalist in any sense . 
  simply acknowledging one 's nationality ( or ethnicity in your example ) is not what i meant . 
  * assuming * is perhaps a better description - taking emotional interest in that identity , being * proud * of it . 
  this can be innocent , simply being happy with the situation , or exclusive , feeling superior and deserving from it . 
  we 'll just have to agree to disagree on the definition of the term * nationalism * , i guess . 
  i know plenty of people who understand it in the `` innocent '' definition . 
  i was trying to say it is used both ways , which is confusing . 
  english is not my primary language , so perhaps i was n't very clear . 
   buddying up with the eu because it is rich ( although let 's not pretend that is n't a factor ) i admitted to just that - it 's a factor . 
   romania would want to be sided with a much larger and richer union because it is beneficial for your security we could perhaps work our way out joining russia . 
  there is a latent conflict between russia and the west , we 're stuck in the middle . 
  we 'd rather not-russia . 
   stop equating the two things . 
  i really am not , quite the contrary . 
   you have no idea what my attitude to europe is i have not and i 'm not assuming anything . 
  * you * was in the plural , like the 52 % , which i do n't necessarily disapprove of either . 
  i 'm simply saying there 's a cultural/historical reason there 's a brexit but not a roxit . 
  friends ? 
  dude , * your * wealth is not relevant . 
  we could go for russia 's . 
  perhaps wealth was a factor when choosing the eu * outside * the military discussion . 
  there is something else , our recent ( ~ 200 years ) history has created a very positive view of the west , and the opposite for the east . 
  we are culturally conditioned to prefer the west to the east , well above wealth considerations ( and there is a reaction , what we call [ protochronism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ) ) . 
  you in the uk have the opposite conditioning , what you learn in history class goes around your conflicts with europe-to-be , and more recently , the loss of empire to european wars you * won * . 
  perception of history is a factor in our opposite attitudes towards europe . 
  for me nationalism is simply the recognition of one 's group allegiance . 
  in it 's most extreme forms , it is what you say - but that works for football club fans as well . 
  and some sort of group allegiance , emotionally speaking , is useful even necessary in ensuring the cohesion of a state . 
  it does n't need to be exclusive , it 's enough to see your fellow countrymen as * your own * . 
  you 're missing an important point - we are right at the border with the most conspicuous threat . 
  we will be the first to be involved . 
  wealth is not relevant here , we could choose the other side . 
  we chose europe . 
   you were the enemy .
