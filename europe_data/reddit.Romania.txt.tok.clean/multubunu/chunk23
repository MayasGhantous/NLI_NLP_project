  we were your allies . 
  after the ribbentrop-molotov pact we lost 40 % of our territory with not a whisper from our allies . 
  we suffered due to our own stupidity , yeah . 
  nationalism is a type of group identity , there are several - isms like that . 
  football fans , for instance . 
  i see no problem with supra-national european identity , which in fact we already have , just not necessarily associated with a state . 
   the first one where a nation create a state : germany , italy , greece and eastern europe . 
  [ ... ] the second one where the state create a nation . 
  nationalism appeared in europe in the early xix-th century , so all states formed after that will appear as being built on it , while the others vice-versa . 
   dutch and german phrase it as dutch and deutsch and you have your answer . 
  * teribil * is a neologism . 
  i guess i misunderstood you . 
  it 's a neologism . 
  as for ivan , it 's * cel groaznic * . 
  no , it 's just where they come from . 
  romania , hungary , and serbia are virtually 100 % in the danube basin . 
  i have no regrets , myself . 
   we had to learn the political map of europe in 7th grade so did we . 
  there were two germanies , one czechoslovakia , a place called yugoslavia , and no baltics . 
  maps are funny like that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c4%83ile_herculane the nature is utterly splendid . 
  the old austrian buildings ... rather derelict . 
  all sorts of natural and historical things to see - you can even take a roman bath in an actual roman bath , at hotel roman . 
  or\u0219ova and the artificial lake on the danube are pretty close too . 
  * lacul morii * in bucharest , figuring on the map , was made between 1985-1987 , recently enough to be captured [ in satellite imagery ] ( https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/#v=44.43754,26.06733,10.812,latlng&amp;t=0.00 ) ( center-left ) . 
  yeah , in this case too the person being interviewed is a `` russky dukh activist and communist party member '' . 
  interestingly , the nationalist accents to ee communism are a result of khrushchev 's de-stalinization , which threatened stalinist leaders like dej or zhivkov , not least by inspiring reformists like nagy or dubcek . 
  how on earth such legacy may affect russians is beyond me . 
  nationalists often cherish the memory of past tyrants and butchers . 
  what is special here is that * russian * nationalists erect a statue of a * georgian * tyrant , who was an internationalist , and would have sent these nationalists to die in the very place they erected the monument to his misunderstood memory . 
  it 's a sort of stockholm syndrome , but should ceau\u015fescu have stood for free elections in his time , he would n't have had a chance . 
  none of the ee dictators had . 
  it 's a different situation here , where putin got associated with ` good times ' , if you want a romanian equivalent it 's iliescu in 1992 , which was not a good year at all , but he still got reelected . 
  ah , * rasa puli * ( as the breed is known in romania ) . 
  that 's a shepherd 's dog too , herding dog . 
  a lovely pet if not excessively active . 
  it 's still capitalism , just on a leash . 
  more enjoyable than consumers-on-a-leash style socialism , if you ask me . 
  maybe . 
  we are discussing the 2011 census numbers . 
  the national average is ~ 3.2 % ( ~ 620k total ) , one of the reasons i was curious about your source . 
   bucharest - 24k - 2.5 % this puts the total population of bucharest at 960k , less than half the figure for 2011 ( 1931k urban ) . 
  any source for your data ? 
  how does * e premte * derive from * veneris diaes * ? 
  ne : it does n't :  from earlier variants e prende or e prente , from the name of prenda , a pagan goddess protector of women , from proto-indo-european * pr\u0101y - , * pr\u0113y - ` like , love ' . 
  cognate to germanic * frijj\u014d ( cf. 
  old norse freyja ( `` lady , mistress '' ) , english friday ) , sanskrit \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f ( pr\u012by\u0101\u0301 , `` beloved , wife '' ) . 
  probably a calque of latin dies veneris . 
   how is this weird ? 
  this chain started with a comment doubting the possibility of becoming so fat in that age . 
  your comment makes the assumption they had highly privileged individuals in the neolithic , which is contradicted by archeology - [ \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck had no apparent social classes , as no houses with distinctive features ( belonging to royalty or religious hierarchy , for example ) have been found so far . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%87atalh%c3%b6y%c3%bck#culture ) i was simply stating a fact . 
  a statue of a goddess with anatomically correct obesity features imply * some * obese people must have existed at the time . 
  it still means they had an idea how obese people look , implying they saw at least one . 
   mutual defence strategy the warsaw pact had only two major military operations : the invasion of hungary in 1956 , and that of czechoslovakia in 1968 . 
  since both countries were members , one could argue the pact was n't particularly * offensive * . 
  the fact remains that , once dissolved , everybody and their dog ran to join nato and the eu , including three former soviet states , albania limping behind , and czechoslovakia splitting along the way , but both resulting nations still joining `` the west '' . 
  yes , the warsaw pact was a * mutual defense strategy * - of the respective governments , against the people of their countries . 
  but [ there 's more to it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/our_lady,_star_of_the_sea ) , st. mary is seen as a protector of sailors based on an ancient interpretation of her name . 
  `` all tests positive . '', 
  similarly , in romania it is navy day . 
   then you bring it home with you ... gah , americans are so weird ... 
   what 's the romanian prison equivalent of ky gel this is a poor , backwards country , horse-and-cart-transportation , subsistance farming poor . 
  the rights of convicts are far from being prioritezed , as they are in the civilized world . 
  i 'm affraid we 're talking picnic style , * bring your own gel * kind of prison time . 
  there should be gel smugglers on the inside , though , a little research may help one avoid a lot of pain . 
  yes , i get that . 
  i have no doubt it was staged . 
  i 'm just saying it has to be proven in court , and sky news expects that to be difficult . 
  actually , there is only circumstancial evidence ( them being spotted 300km away from where they claimed to have filmed ) and witnesses that would be hard to prove genuine , and easy to dismiss as biased afterwards . 
  sky is betting on tis , imo . 
  it may all be hilariously obvious to the natives , and it is , still difficult to prove in court . 
  sky news tried to create the news , instead they made the news . 
  to clarify : hotel security camera places mr. ramsay and his interpreter in tg . 
  mure\u0219 , in accordance with the `` terrorists ' '' story and ~ 300km away from the ukrainian border where he claimed to have filmed . 
  [ the fools who just do n't understand journalism just do n't . 
  lukashenko has two advantages over erdogan : first , he is successor to a long tradition of dictature , while erdogan has to fight established democratic reflexes of at least part of the population . 
  secondly , there 's little to worry about in belarus , while turkey has a war on its borders and associated refugee situation , an inner latent war with the kurds , a frozen war in cyprus , and perennial frustration from the eu . 
  additionally , we expect more from turkey than belarus . 
   would be allowed to leave with some money ( and other property , such as some paintings ) the famous * royal train * is actually carol ii 's after his own abdication . 
  mihai did n't take anything , not even bed sheets , confirmed by my grandfather who was in the `` evaluation '' committee after mihai 's abdication . 
  well , he was the only king to [ go on strike ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_i_of_romania#reign_under_communism ) , how cool is that . 
  and he did manage to keep nationalization on hold for a while ( they did it after the abdication ) , so there 's that . 
   the uk was one of the few big members not to use the brake on eastern europe . 
  they did in 2007 . 
  it 's all lei officially , from prices in shops to salaries to real estate . 
  you can not in fact use euros in any official transaction . 
  if you buy a house or negotiate a salary , both parties will talk euros , but everything will be written down in lei at the current exchange rate . 
  you end up with funny looking sums , like 312284 lei for a house ( which is 70k euros exactly ) . 
  nope , they are distinct populations . 
  the crimean tatars were colonized in dobrogea by the turks after 1856 , some people of both ethnicities remained there after 1877 . 
  constan\u021ba has mostly turks , medgidia mostly tatars . 
  erdogan is notoriously purgative .

  they really should eat more fiber . 
  the americans were right along . 
  um , no * burduf * involved ? 
  i really like the foc\u015fani cream cheese ( though i did n't have any in quite a while ), 
   germany fucked themselves ... with griezmann . 
   just having an opinion and staying at home the * facebook * effect .
