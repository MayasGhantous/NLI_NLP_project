   you ca n't export your cake and eat it too, 
  budapest would be a good choice , imho , and if they go to bucharest by mistake , we have romanian grade internet to allow them to work remotely . 
  [ not entirely ] ( https://twitter.com/ericidle/status/734763592331841536 ) . 
   it 's just now that people who 've thought i 'd better shut my mouth , now think it 's appropriate to open it and spread the hate . 
  i do n't fully agree . 
  while there are people who will always be xenophobes , and people who will always be against that , most do not care one way or the other . 
  in times of great public emotion the latter will simply be swayed in . 
  it does n't mean that the average citizen was always a bloodthirsty monster , just that given enough anxiety , it may become one , and this is true for any nation . 
  it 's not like everybody hated that lady before , but rather their pent up * unrelated * frustrations are coming out in a way that , following recent events , appears as socially acceptable or even patriotic . 
  dude ... we had a meetup yesterday ... nobody reads the damned stickies . 
  welcome !, 
   cut down on the spin a little good idea . 
  let 's . 
  ###### ** claim one : it was n't me ** farage was a leading figure of the campaign [ s ? ], 
  to leave the eu . 
  if honesty was ever a concern for him , he would have made his point with time to spare . 
  the * # 350m a week for the nhs * claim was widely known in the uk and everywhere else . 
  if farage chose to keep his mouth shut during the campaign , he should have kept silent * the day after the vote * . 
  his statement is projecting the image that the winning side of this referendum is politically inept . 
  ###### ** claim two : black is white and vice versa ** well , british politicians * did * [ learn something from the immigrants ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8ldhoyzzwe ) after all . 
  where is the ball ? 
  ( clarification : in romania , the native country of those fraudsters in the video , that con is known as * white-black * ) . 
  ###### ** claim three : brief period of reflection ** what for ? 
  did n't everybody reflect beforehand ? 
  you ca n't really expect us to believe that the leave campaign [ s ? ], 
  did n't have a plan for after winning this thing ? 
  there are different consequences for that approach . 
  like say a considerable loss of prestige ? 
  what you see in the markets right now is international loss of confidence in your nation . 
  imagine the next uk govt saying * yes , we pushed brexit for several years , now we need time to figure out what that means * . 
  that 's when you are drunk and you keep a minimum of clothing on . 
  it 's a reference to the soviet fraternal kiss , most famously a depiction of brezhnev french-kissing honecker was [ on the berlin wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/my_god,_help_me_to_survive_this_deadly_love ) . 
  there are [ many other examples ] ( http://productio-webloadb-xh7m8u4nserz-641115252.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/culture/lgbt/photos-a-history-of-kissing-in-russia/ ) . 
   c\u00e9line dion and justin bieber leonard cohen , joni mitchell , triumph ... oh , and rush . 
   nasreddin we have * nastratin hogea * , but that seems imported from bulgaria by [ anton pann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_pann ) . 
  some of the anecdotes have parallels in the local folklore character [ * p\u0103cal\u0103 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c4%83cal%c4%83 ) . 
   obvious troll comment a german describing a joke . 
   the racist card . 
  i forgot about that . 
  * facepalm * . 
  that 's from your article . 
   a ton did get expulsed . 
  13k in 2014 . 
  so how come crime rates in romania are at a 7 year low ? 
  that is the topic on this page ... 
  yep . 
  your link above makes the point that * accusations * may be the result of bias . 
  so how many were * convicted * ? 
  say it in french , if english is too hard for you , i can manage . 
   between 2009-2011 you seem fixated on that particular timeframe . 
  in the meantime there was cooperation between romanian and french police to combat that ( also romanian-brittish police , and i think romanian-italian too ) , as you certainly read in [ the link ] ( http://www.franceinter.fr/emission-ailleurs-les-policiers-francais-et-roumains-collaborent-pour-demanteler-la-criminalite-rom ) i posted above . 
  we are in mid-2016 . 
  any news ? 
  you did n't actually read it , did you ? 
  ( there 's also the minor fact that the wikipedia link lists 74,661 romanians in france , not 71,000 as you posted ), 
   roma children that 's what the article says , i only emphasized * children * . 
   theft and ** burglaries ** yeah , * vols , cambriolage , mendicit\u00e9 agressive * . 
  i wonder how they manage to do all that , those ambitious * enfants * . 
    the article says :  grande majorit\u00e9 dans des affaires de vols , d'agressions et d'escroqueries neither your article nor mine contain that phrase . 
   that 's just an assumption desperately trying to justify the statistics . 
  that 's actually a quote from the article / u/raio30 linked , my addition is merely a gloss on the last phrase . 
  interestingly , i could not find the same data in the ** french ** press . 
  the more recent results center around : [ * claude gu\u00e9ant jug\u00e9 pour ses primes en liquide * ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/09/28/01016-20150928artfig00010-claude-gueant-juge-pour-ses-primes-en-liquide-place-beauvau.php ) ... guy doe n't like competition , i guess . 
   20000 cases of burglaries in 2011 . 
  nope , 20.000 * mise en cause * , for all crime . 
  there is no indication of how many of those crimes were violent . 
  btw , do you have a real source ? 
  your link mentions a leaked document that is not reproduced . 
  furthermore , a couple of months later french and romanian police cooperate against the criminality of [ roma * children * ] ( http://www.franceinter.fr/emission-ailleurs-les-policiers-francais-et-roumains-collaborent-pour-demanteler-la-criminalite-rom ) ... guess the * vols et cambriolages * refer to pickpockets and scammers . 
  just like i said above . 
  i did n't see the show you were referencing , but historical loss of roma language within roma communities is well documented , e.g. 
  mihail kog\u0103lniceanu * schi\u021b\u0103 asupra \u021biganilor * - 1837 ( he mentions the * v\u0103tra\u0219i * as having lost their language , and includes the * l\u0103utari * among them ) . 
  which is recounted in the wikipedia article on the [ * l\u0103utari * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c4%83utari#history ) . 
   you are implying all bad things that happen and include eastern europe include romanians as well . 
  hey , but they do . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/13/horsemeat-scandal-dutch-connection-romania ) . 
   the word is : itinerant criminals i count two words there , but none answer my post . 
  to spell it out for you : where in the article you linked does it say * romanian * ? 
   among the arrested suspects , many eastern europeans . 
  yes folks , when the west was n't looking we conquered eastern europe . 
  our success now out , we hereby assume responsibility for all crime originating in our new empire . 
  i was keeping it simple myself ( you link to the same article as i did ) . 
  which everybody should do , it 's a simple matter after all !, 
  to complicate matters , the romani language consists of a [ large number of dialects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_language#dialects ) , futhermore there are roma clans speaking romanian/vlax * outside * romania , e.g. 
  the * b\u0103ie\u0219i * in hungary and the * monteni * in bulgaria . 
   the data published relates to numbers of arrests and not number of arrested individuals . 
  strictly speaking therefore , it is not the equivalent of 15 romanians who are arrested every day , but the equivalent of 15 arrests of romanian citizens . 
  few people being repeatedly arrested , likely for begging which presumably does not warrant deportation ? 
   in particular they seem to have taken a liking for armed robberies of shops . 
  armed robberies of shops are ( and were , in living memory ) practically unheard of in romania . 
  perhaps there was n't much to rob , but that kind of skill was not `` exported '' in any significant number . 
  as a matter of fact googling ` romania armed robbery ' came out with [ this ] ( http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/509812/british-abroad-romania-violent-armed-robbery-knives ) . 
   violent thieves i think we 're mostly exporting pickpockets and scammers , not burglars or robbers . 
   the list of countries that have put billionaires in jail is made up of romania and china , that 's it . 
  and russia . 
  actually , you could count berlusconi too . 
  and [ allen stanford ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allen_stanford ) . 
  ... or [ * naked guy dropping lactating dog with a log sticking out its neck * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/54cqcgf.png ), 
  no , it 's [ the empire of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_empire ) . 
   anybody show me any kind of document dated before 1950 talking about rom/roma whatever and i 'll change my mind .
