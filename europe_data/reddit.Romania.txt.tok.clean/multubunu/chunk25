  the 12th  and yes , it 's an aro . 
  the 11th picture is the swimming pool with artificial waves [ at hotel lido ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.4412237,26.0986981,71m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) in bucharest . 
  not sure if it 's still operational , gm shows it empty . 
  totally off-topic , but is your username a reference to [ pifou ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bc8xhjz.png ) ? 
  i am no better informed than you are , and frankly , nobody is . 
  we have three hypotheses : - romance speaking people never left what we now call romania - they lived in the mountains and descended sometime prior to the xiii-th century - they came ( presumably from the south ) prior to the xiii-th century neither can be conclusively proven ( or disproven ) with existing evidence . 
  and speaking of ethnogenesis , look up `` f\u00e2rtatul \u0219i nef\u00e2rtatul '' , or `` colinda ursului '' . 
  the latter is still practiced in bucovina - essentially the bear is a positive character ( like * capra * ) , hinting to a pre-agricultural origin ( bears are feared by pastoralists and farmers , while hunter-gatherers like the native americans usually hold them in respect - no sheep to lose ) . 
  also , the bear of this tradition is dying and is resurrected ( some variants even have a doctor helping him ) - a metaphor for the cycle of nature based in the bear 's hibernation . 
  now take this : [ * porphyrius ( 3rd century ) says that he was so named because he [ zalmoxis ] had been wrapped in a bearskin at birth , and zalmon is the thracian word for `` hide '' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zalmoxis#etymology ) . 
  what does this mean ? 
  well , nothing , really . 
  it * could * be that the zalmoxis tradition was not dacian at all , but rather a stone age shamanic remnant whose last gasp is * colinda ursului * . 
  it * could * support the first hypothesis above , the resilient proto-chronic romanians laid low for ten centuries , and only came back in sight when the tartars shattered the political status quo in the xiii-th century . 
  there 's plenty more to gloss on the supposedly satem substratum ( * sut\u0103 * is the only non-latin numeral we have , and it 's not slavic ; * cioban * is listed as turkic , but the turks borrowed it from the persians , who spoke an iranic * satem * language etc. ), 
  but there 's plenty of disparate little things like that ca n't honestly be made into a viable theory . 
  there 's no point in cherrypicking facts and filling out gaps with wishful thinking , and the best that can be said on this matter is : we do n't know . 
   `` lopata '' is a slavic derived word . 
  * lopat\u0103 * ( shovel ) has an [ albanese cognate ] ( https://translate.google.com/#sq/ro/lopat%c3%ab ) as well . 
  how about the rest of my list ? 
    the rule is `` if it 's man made , it 's usually a slavic derived '' . 
  cas\u0103 , fereastr\u0103 , u\u0219\u0103 , [ curte ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/curte/443797 ) ( * yard * , < cohortem ) , b\u0103t\u0103tur\u0103 , gard ( ~ alb . 
  gardh , but similar to * yard * , not * grad * ) , poart\u0103 , c\u0103ru\u021b\u0103 / car , c\u0103rare ...  iron making infact is predominantly slavic iron = * fier * , f\u0103urar ( ironsmith ) , foale ( bellows ) , cuptor ( oven , furnace ) , a bate ( fierul ) ... ? 
   records attests of combined slavic and vlach forces by various records i am only aware of bulgarian and vlachs combined forces , and that only recorded during kaloyan 's reign in the xii-th century . 
   the romano-slav synthesis happened as romanian pastoralists started interacting and moving into slavic settlements . 
  that are still called * sat * ( < fossatum ) , at least settlements of agriculturalists . 
   linguistic analysis shows a population with strong latin roots which completely lost urban/agricultural words urban , maybe . 
  agricultural , though , not really . 
  the words for wheat , ear ( of wheat , * spic * ) , rye , millet , linen ( flax ) , hemp etc. 
  are all of latin descent . 
  so are those for agricultural tools like spade or sickle . 
  heck , the words for peasant and soil both descend from * terra * . 
  also , land property ( * mo\u0219ie * ) , inheritance ( * mo\u0219tenire * ) , land owner ( * mo\u0219nean * ) are probably substratum ( * mo\u0219 * , meaning * old man * , has an albanese cognate meaning * age * ) . 
   romanians/vlahs were your classic nomadic pastoral hill people . 
  contradicted by two things . 
  besides the latin/substratum agricultural lexicon , romanian shows significant ( and ancient ) slavic influence . 
  or the slavs were sedentary , so could n't have had much linguistic contact with nomads . 
   i think the vote is slightly premature the vote is not tomorrow . 
  it 's just an announcement ( or escalation ) . 
  it may very well be sturgeon forces her way in at the negotiation table for art . 
  50 , as any competent politician would . 
  scotland does n't * need * to leave the uk , and why not grab some extra devolution when they were conned at the last referendum . 
  well , it seems most languages have that , with the notable exceptions of turkish and dutch . 
  so the message they are trying to convey is only understandable if you are nether sender or receiver . 
  dadaism right there . 
  that 's the name of the fruit , right ? 
  the question here was if the same word is used for fruit and color , apparently neither in dutch or turkish ( though it is in many other languages ) . 
   that 's only the case in english french as well , and i think italian too . 
  romanian too , except it 's * portocal\u0103 * for the fruit and * portocaliu * for the color ( although * oranj * is used sometimes for the color ) . 
  interestingly , we did have a phrase * \u021a\u0103rile de jos * ( the lower countries ) , but it applied collectively to the netherlands and belgium . 
  and their language is related to hungarian . 
  lots of people leaving , and i 'm just preparing to go in :( family ... 
  i can only remember a copy from the 70 's - 80 's , untranslated . 
  bamse was the name , that 's all i could figure out . 
  funny enough , the one foreign comic that really put it 's mark on my childhood was not in these posts . 
  which are * very * familiar to me , unlike the main post . 
  i mean , i remember [ professor balthazar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/professor_balthazar_and_his_machine.jpg ) , [ calimero ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/stripgenerator/strip/10/57/27/00/00/full.png ) , the local [ gopo ] ( http://presadeturism.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gopo.jpg ) , heck i even remeber [ andeojito ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6bkaggulphs/st3jhi8x70i/aaaaaaaacgg/gl_aljfspcc/s400/anteojito3.jpg ) ; i remeber sanitka or arabela ( czech productions ) ; but i have no clue about the image posted . 
  well there 's nothing nationalistic about us ** b ** , which was the name of the original organization , 
  just stumbled upon [ this pic ] ( http://www.ziaristionline.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/piata-universitatii-mai-1990-foto-emanuel-parvu.jpg ) of pia\u021ba universit\u0103\u021bii in 1990 - at least half the crowd is out of view . 
  [ fuzzy crowd view ] ( https://vid.me/khf3 ) - the phone 's camera did n't stand a chance . 
  each evening the crowd peaks between 9:00 - 10:00 pm . 
  the number at 8:00 pm was 100k , but grew rapidly after . 
  other estimates put the peak at 250k , but agree with 100k at 8:00 . 
  so perhaps their news was ~ 1h behind , that 's all . 
   the largest was piata universitatii actually there were about 10k daily , and the * daily * part is impressive . 
  it peaked in 100-150k on occasion - one that i remember was a march against chi\u021bac in mid may , that ended there . 
  the square itself in pia\u021ba universit\u0103\u021bii is small , but the street was occupied completely and the capacity is somewhat similar , if you count the park in front of the national theatre . 
  the march for the release of marian munteanu ( july 15th ) was about 150k , as counted by the bbc . 
  28th of january was 100-150k as well . 
  12th january is unknown , but might have peaked about the same . 
  8th of november was 150k + l ( when alian\u021ba civic\u0103 was announced ) - this is the one i missed , not being in bucharest . 
  the 100k were at ceau\u0219escu 's meeting on 21 , not at the protests . 
  on the 22nd ( when he fled ) there were likely 200-300k in bucharest . 
  there were several other protests in the 150k range in bucharest during 1990 . 
  however , * at national level * , the current protests are possibly the largest ever - and increasing . 
   haha . 
  boris johnson say no more . 
   its donald j trump though strange how it 's best abbreviated donald d. 
  implied in `` elections being late '' , 
   protests in romania are really rare . 
  they 're pretty much annual since 2012 . 
  2016 did n't have one , but mostly because elections were so late in the year , 
  no , it is the mods ' polite way of saying * enough is enough * . 
   which is what i just said what you said is that transylvanian saxons are so called because hungarians * call * ( present tense ) them so . 
  your exact phrase :  that 's because in hungarian we call all germans living in transylvania saxons my stance is that this error originates with xii-th century hungarians , not contemporary ones . 
  and i find it interesting how this mistake became so accepted that even transylvanian germans have come to think of themselves as saxons when in fact they are not . 
  it 's because saxons were employed by the hungarian administration at the time of german colonization in transylvania ( xii-th century ) , so hungarians referred to all transylvanian germans as saxons . 
  the swabians are a different branch that were colonized much later in eastern europe , xviii-th century or so , in austrian times . 
  in romania they live ( d ) mostly in banat ( \u0219vabi ) . 
  definitely . 
  the other person was talking about `` 9 sieben '' , i tried to offer a clarification . 
  i suppose siebenburgen really means seven cities , although it 's more romantic to translate it as seven castles . 
  there 's a lot of little quirks like that in what everybody `` knows '' about transilvania - for instance there were only few saxons among the transilvanian `` saxons '' , the majority being franconian . 
  yep . 
  i also linked r\u00e2\u0219nov and c\u00e2lnic , which are not in the seven . 
  well ... [ it means both ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burg#old_saxon ) . 
  i suppose only the ones that protected a town ( versus agricultural communities ) were counted in the * siebenburgen * name . 
   sieben means 7 ... and burgen means cities , of which [ seven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons#fortification_of_the_towns ) stood out .
