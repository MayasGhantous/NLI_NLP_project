  there are several saxon fortresses that are not in cities , e.g. 
  [ r\u00e2\u0219nov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a2%c8%99nov_citadel ) or [ c\u00e2lnic ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/cetatea_din_c%c3%a2lnic ) ( ro ) , and countless [ fortified churches ] ( http://www.sibiu-turism.ro/culture-and-heritage-religious-heritage-fortified-churches-the-fortified-church-from-cristian.aspx ) . 
  in the singular , [ * ban * ] ( http://media1.allnumis.com/21664/10-07-2013/1-ban-2013_21664_016672898e091fl.jpg ) means 1/100 lei ( aka * cent * ) . 
  the equivalent of the english word * money * ( which lacks a plural form ) is * bani * ( plural only ) . 
    pen\u00edze   from proto-germanic `` panningaz ''  well i have an alternative theory about its etymology in mind ... pennies ? 
  norway already ? 
  you 're missing some important parts of the move , [ here 's a breakdown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnxqse5cydg ) ( in romanian ) . 
  so yeah , prisons are overcrowded so let 's pardon penal * fines * and re-appropriation of damages . 
  the one on the right , yes . 
  in the other you can see the intecontinental in the background , it 's probably taken [ from this building ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.4410867,26.0995857,3a,75y,264.91h,124.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfhxiuaptaqt86tt6zz9v3g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  unrealistic ? 
  singapore is a city . 
  the uk is a city plus a couple of countries . 
  what 's in it for norfolk , as a random example ? 
   i see you understand `` influence '' the way it suits you i see you understand `` examples '' the way it suits you . 
  any examples of shakespeare 's influence on french literature ? 
  spanish ? 
  italian ? 
  german ? 
   can you provide any kind of argument that ** other ** russian writers influenced in some way the western literature . 
  this discussion began with someone quoting russian literature as * influential * , when they really meant * world class * or something of that sort . 
  you jumped on that ( yes , you 're all over the page with `` asking a simple question '' and what not ) , i gave you * two * names , and * with quotes supporting my statement * ( check the sources on the wikipedia pages ) . 
  now you are in the position to ask `` what * else * did the romans do for us '' , while unable to support your own statements with anything beyond `` everybody knows '' type of arguments . 
  you want more * influential * russian authors ? 
  pasternak ? 
  was gorki an influence on left-leaning literature in the west ? 
  speaking of whom , you may be aware that pete seeger 's [ * where have all the flowers gone * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/where_have_all_the_flowers_gone%3f ) is based on a poem in sholokhov ( while seeger himself is referenced in a book by yevtushenko translated as * sweet land of apples * in romanian ) . 
   and having that story in mind , what we see about shakespeare or homer , is quite another thing : their lyrics ( or those attributed to them ) , their methods are still in use even nowadays . 
  and their influence is literally can indeed be found everywhere you are asking me for quotes when you only provide opinion . 
   we had pretty good relations with russia while it was a tsardom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_bucharest_ ( 1812 ), 
   dostoyevsky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyodor_dostoyevsky#reception_and_influence people quoting him as influential include kafka , joyce , virginia woolfe , and nietzsche . 
  here 's from joyce :  he is the man more than any other who has created modern prose , and intensified it to its present-day pitch . 
  it was his explosive power which shattered the victorian novel but do read the wikipedia article . 
  on tolstoy , hemingway [ is quoted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_and_peace#reception ) to say that he 'd been taking lessons from him on how to :  write about war in the most straightforward , honest , objective and stark way . 
  your argument is sophistic , anyway . 
  one does n't need to `` prove '' that authors like homer or shakespeare were `` influential '' . 
  come to think of it , it 's actually not ugly .

  on the other hand i always thought the magi ( or is it kings ) visited jesus at birth , so i was a bit surprised  eh , i 'm no biblical scholar . 
   it 's the day the three wise men arrived to see jesus that 's western tradition . 
  from your link :  eastern christians , on the other hand , commemorate the baptism of jesus in the jordan river and that explains the * yordan * part ( yordanov = genitive of yordan + den = day , aka * day of jordan * ) . 
  in romainia the same feast is known as * boboteaz\u0103 * ( botez = baptism ) . 
  well , that was a little mean . 
  but we do pay back in ways that are not always obvious . 
  a precondition to joining the eu was privatization of utilities . 
  in bucharest the water services were acquired by veolia through a subsidiary called apa nova . 
  the price of tap water has increased by a factor of 11 since then , and * my * money goes to this eu-based company and its shareholders , not in our roads . 
  but the final point would be that we are a market for eu products ( and i * was * a big nokia fan , back in the day ) . 
  eu money that goes into infrastructure is an investment , as it helps trade and increases revenue for * all * european companies trading here . 
  ultimately you are not paying for other people 's roads . 
  they are european roads , they are * your * roads as well . 
  but it 's paid back in nokia profits on products sold in romania . 
  right ? 
  [ moldavia did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pokuttya ) , centuries before uniting with walachia to form romania ( 1859 ) . 
  at the time \\* of the union \\* the territory of modern day republic of moldova was under russian occupation , so the republic is not a legal successor to the principate of moldavia ( as suggested by op 's map ) . 
   turns out bucharest had a super destructive earthquake decades ago 1977 , about 1500 dead in bucharest alone , and the city full of sights like [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgjwtey5ots ) ( nsfl ) . 
  and there have been several sizable ones since ( 1986 , 1990 ) . 
  it gets hard to keep ones cool . 
   it does n't contain any beef these days , so the name is a huge lie . 
  i have only ever eaten boeuf salad * with * beef . 
  my mother makes it with beef , so does my so , so did her mother , so does everyone in the extended families . 
  i was actually quite surprised to read here that some have never made it that way  why do you think [ these things ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/veal-shank.jpg/175px-veal-shank.jpg ) are in all supermarkets ? 
  it 's not like ossobuco is popular over here , 
   before that it was an autonomous principality that was annexed by the russian empire nope . 
  the russian empire annexed the eastern half of the moldavian principality , which continued to exist in the remaining territory . 
  the moldavian principality united in 1859 with the southern principality of wallachia to form romania . 
  the eastern half got its independence from the nascent ussr and united with romania in 1918 . 
  in reply the ussr formed a moldavian republic in territories currently known as transnistria , to which it annexed the eastern half of moldavia in 1945 . 
   turkic peoples are not mongols , and your link does n't imply that they are . 
  it was just a paragraph , dude . 
  here 's the tldr to that , with emphasys on keywords :  among the ruling elites of ** mongol ** empire successor states such as the chagatai khanate and golden horde . 
  these elites ** adopted turkic languages ** and different religions such as buddhism and islam , while ** retaining mongol ** political and legal institutions no , turkic peoples are ** not ** mongols . 
  ** tatars ** are , by ethnicity , although they may speak turkic ** languages ** nowadays . 
   people should n't really be troubled that she is a muslim . 
  nobody really is here . 
  the muslims in romania are about as many as russians - the lipovans , religious refugees from russia . 
  no little green men there , and no salafi hotheads . 
  we 're pretty cool in coexistence with minorities , even with those that lost at triathlon . 
  as you say , our biggest concern is - and should be - nepotism and corruption . 
   hardly yes , that 's the point he 's trying to make . 
   tatars are a turkic people a turkic speaking people of [ mongol ethnicity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turco-mongol ) . 
  many have a clearly [ asian appearance ] ( http://interetnica.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/foto-interviu-metin-omer.jpg ) . 
  i ca n't really say , maybe they avoided to confuse you by using a too local term ? 
  i did hear the term beeing used by both city and country folk from maramure\u015f . 
  they do , it 's a term of [ ukrainian origin ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/horilka ) . 
  sometimes it is used for low quality liquor , other forms being horilca or holerca . 
  there is one term left apart that is widespread enough : vinars / jinars . 
  it literally means [ brandy ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brandy ) ( burnt wine ) . 
  acceptable . 
  6 right in front of the chinese embassy , but nk is two buildings down the road . 
   `` north street '' no. 6  ) ~ ~ which is the address to the embassy of china . ~ ~ nope , it 's two buildings down the road . 
  so where is the tragedy , exactly ? 
  i would call a tragedy [ the ip massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ip_massacre ) , or [ the one in tr\u0103znea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treznea_massacre ) . 
  i actually have an aunt from bihor ( which was never 100 % hungarian , you know ) that remembers 1940 , never talks about it but hungarians are not a suitable subject at family dinners . 
   the reason that diplomats do n't go to celebrate this is not simply that it would celebrate a loss of territory . 
  hungarian diplomats never had a problem with december 1st until today . 
  what is special about 2016 ? 
  what , in your opinion , would be a reasonable response from romania for 1940 ? 
  in my view , as stated above , both sides should act like grown-ups . 
  bygones are bygones , what matters is the present , and above it , the future .
