  some of us on these boards may be too young for that , but diplomats have no excuse . 
   it celebrates a tragedy of hungarian history not at all . 
  it celebrates the [ alba iulia national assembly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_transylvania_with_romania#alba_iulia_national_assembly ) 's decision of union with romania . 
  the romanians ' decision ( 54 % of transylvanians ) was supported two weeks later by the german minority 's similar decision , another 10 % of the population . 
  the 31 % minority hungarians were not enough to disqualify that . 
  national days often have a win/lose side to them . 
  but july 4th is not perceived as offensive by the british , just a celebration of american independence . 
  you see , march 15th may be seen as a `` national tragedy '' in romania , as it sparked events that led to civil war in transylvania , romanian loss of life , and subsequent subjugation . 
  perhaps we can all act like adults a century later ? 
   it became popular entirely because of this video ... in the us . 
  in europe it was a hit on its own :  it shot to the number one spot on the eurochart hot 100 , where it remained for 12 weeks between june and early september 2004 . 
  [ 4 ] it topped the single charts in germany , france and austria for over three months , reached three in the united kingdom and 72 on the u.s. 
  pop 100 . 
  the song became the fourth best-selling single of the 21st century in france , with 1,170,000 units sold . 
  [ 5 ] a popular cover of the song was made by romanian pop singer haiducii , which also charted in many countries , especially italy and sweden where it topped the singles charts . 
   in the medieval ages , everyone [ not everyone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum ) . 
  that 's why march 15 [ means different things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1848#romanians ) to hungarians and romanians , just like december 1st does . 
  it is mostly obsolete , but [ it had its day ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/puicu%c8%9b%c4%83/937524 ) . 
  there ore other [ derived words ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/puiculean%c4%83/424221 ) with the same meaning , regional or archaic though . 
  thanks , i do n't speak spanish . 
  same etymology , though . 
  i am reading that in spanish and catalan the term * pollo * means both chicken and dick . 
  we have only kept the figurative meaning for * pul\u0103 * and made up * pui [ c\u0103 ] * for chicken , and * that * has it 's own figurative meaning similar to * chick * ( girl ) - think * puicu\u021b\u0103 * . 
  this sounds less credible . 
  the romanian government ( and especially the german king ) were not that much into antagonizing their allies austria-hungary , especially since independence from the porte was only achieved in 1878 , plus the vicinity of russia . 
  and private organizations would n't have had the money to do anything on that scale . 
  also , no one could have anticipated wwi and circumstances where this move would have made a difference . 
  if it were possible and they could afford it , it seems more likely that people would have bought the land for themselves . 
   the banks of romania !, 
  they bought those good lands , and then gave it to the romanian families . 
  this sounds genuinely interesting , could you point me to a source ? 
  i gather it would have still been the romanian state borrowing from banks for this move , and this in really hard times , romania was so broke after wwi that even [ the victory arch ] ( https://cutiacuvechituri.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tit_arctrvechi_p66.jpg ) they built only lasted for some 12 years due to cheap materials , and was eventually [ replaced ] ( http://www.fotoshooting.ro/wp-content/uploads/poze-vechi-din-bucuresti-1940-arcul-de-triumf.jpg ) . 
   belgae , which also had a branch in pre-roman britain yep , the city of winchester is built on top of a roman city on top of a celtic one called venta belgarum , which i think meant * market of the belgae * . 
  on the bright side the pound is depreciating . 
  we have [ caracal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caracal,_romania ) too , though we do n't appreciate it as much as we should . 
  well , the last two paragraphs in your quote support safdie 's own opinion . 
  if you think of it , habitat is big , but not * massive * , due to its apparently disorganized shape . 
  also , much of the concrete was supposed to be hidden under rooftop gardens - see the [ sketch ] ( https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2014/09/habitat-67-brutalism-feature_dezeen_3_1000.gif ) in the article . 
  except habitat 67 is not really brutalism according to its author :  `` i wanted habitat to look like a highly finished sophisticated project , which is why i went to precasting and i worked very hard to get formwork that would give you really a smooth machine-like surface rather than a brutal rough surface and the boxes come together as very pure geometry , '' says safdie . 
   `` so i think of it as an anti-brutalist building , a reaction to brutalism -- it just happened to be built in that period , but it was n't a brutalist building . '', 
  ( [ source ] ( https://www.dezeen.com/2014/12/19/moshe-safdie-movie-interview-habitat-67/ ) ), 
  while of higher magnitude than 1977 , the 1940 earthquake did significantly less damage , the most visible victim being the newly built carlton hotel , the tallest building in bucharest at the time . 
  but it weakend a good number of buildings ( scala , casata , dunarea ) that subsequently fell in 1977 . 
  the main problem was that romanian architects/engineers of the time were trained in germany and france , places with no earthquakes , so their calculations were aimed at static loads . 
  interestingly , their is a study by one engineer from 1940 that quite accurately predicts which buildings will be affected at the next big earthquake - on mobile now , but will find it as soon as i get to a pc . 
  mostly wwii bombings . 
  the central areas demolished by ceausescu are more to the left and not pictured . 
  also the old royal palace was simply demolished to make room for the.current one - taking with it the golescu house , built cca 1810 , where most of the kingdom 's history happened . 
  the earthquakes ( 1940 and 1977 ) mostly took out buildings built after this picture was taken . 
  yes , it was built before 1850 .

  [ meanwhile in the tower ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3yipc91quk ), 
   kral comes from serbian , which got the word from hungarian it 's a [ proto-slavic word borrowed from old high german ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-slavic/korlj%d1%8c ) , but yes , ultimately from karl / carolus ( magnus ) . 
   if you liked it , then you should have put a coat of arms on it . 
  also known as the chad argument . 
  unfortunately , the linear b tablets mostly contain accounting data . 
  while this is still useful , it does n't compare to diplomatic correspondence , legal or cultural documents . 
  for example , some tablets from pylos document expenses due to an impending attack on the city , that probably brought its end - but not who the attackers were , where they were coming from , what were their motives , how the attack went , the name of the current wanax and so on . 
   brexit means brexit [ jury 's still out on that one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk16l2bb4fo ) . 
  it 's a lot more accessible from the [ opposite side ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.7497275,22.8891808,3a,75y,230h,99.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxwna_amfsqko13hmtfdzba!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
   it 's not connected with religion at all yes , yes it is . 
  corinthians 11 :  5 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven . 
   6 for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered . 
  it is sort of explained in 11:10  for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels . 
  this is not very clear in kj , the romanian version has - instead of * power * - * a sign of submission * . 
  the angels come a bit weird in cor 11:10 . 
  i 've heard it said that paul references one of the apocrypha ( enoch something-or-other ) , where some angels are seduced by the women 's beauty , and `` resign '' their jobs . 
  their offspring with human women are called nephilim . 
  the flood would be a consequence of this sin . 
  so the headscarf is there to protect angels from temptation . 
  so yeah , it 's all about modesty , and it 's all religious . 
  the bucharest one still exists , it 's in a military cemetery . 
  interesting . 
  in romanian [ * rusneac * ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/rusneac ) used to mean * ukrainian * ( aka * rus ' * ) , the term [ * muscal * ] ( https://dexonline.ro/intrare/muscal/35845 ) meaning * russian * ( as in * from moscow * ) . 
  they were n't used pejoratively .

   our language and our name because of it . 
  this is in fact wrong . 
  * rom\u00e2n * is an endonym , meaning that we ( or rather our ancestors ) called themselves that , and not a consequence of the `` latinity '' of the language . 
  after all albanian was heavily latinized , and in three waves , still they have an unrelated endonym ( shqiptar , from shqipoj < latin excipio = i understand - aka people who speak a `` real '' language ; compare slavic * [ nemetz ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-slavic/n%c4%9bm%d1%8cc%d1%8c ) * = mute ) . ),

   is a single satellite capable of multitasking for the whole south east europe ? 
  i do not know how this particular satellite works , but i 'd guess it simply transmits all channels in bulk , broadband , and it is up to the receivers to select channels and decode according to the owner 's plan .

  i 'd go with * four dead * .

  goes beyond your regular dick joke . 
  some businesses require eu access , some do n't . 
  google is among the latter . 
  they 're not there to `` stick with you '' , it just makes sense from a business perspective . 
  it 's not like they are renouncing doing business elsewhere either .
