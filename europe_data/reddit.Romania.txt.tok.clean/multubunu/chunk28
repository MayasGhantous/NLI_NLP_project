  u/ctudor simply pointed out the emotion in your original comment was unwarranted . 
  google is not there for solidarity 's sake . 
  this said , it * is * a piece of good news , and i enjoy that along with you . 
  so the nationalist internationale does n't really work . 
  i wonder why . 
  even more if you know it 's an english translation from a french text written by a romanian . 
  i was trying to explain the man 's phrase . 
  i 'm ok with nato  ( although an eu army would work too ) . 
   i do n't like nato but it 's the best option we have . 
   and jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon legit . 
  i think they are . 
  a warrior is a prestige position , they probably find plenty of candidates for that . 
  a terrorist is not , so isis needs to trick them in , by giving them the hero status . 
  accepting the language is like blowing in their sails . 
   left-wingers i am on the right , myself . 
  which is no excuse for being irrational . 
   not one single terrorist was ever worried by the attitude of his victims . 
  i suppose not . 
  especially since they die in the process . 
  but that 's beside the point . 
  these people see themselves at war . 
  they are , isis , in syria . 
  they are losing , so they are waging this `` war '' abroad , aimed at weakening resolve by intimidating the public . 
  this can only be done by finding idiots willing to explode at street corners , so they paint this `` warrior '' image , a prestige term for what is in fact a despicable - and fatal - activity . 
  so what we want to do is keep things clear . 
  if we accept their gimmick we are encouraging recruitment , which , remember , it is not done in syria but here . 
  here , say it with me : a terrorist is not a warrior , not a hero , just another bully trying to scare children . 
   terrorist is the name we gave to them . 
  but they are jihadists . 
  jihadists ( warriors ) is the name they give themselves . 
  but one who loses their life to kill a bunch of kids is an incompetent warrior . 
  they * may * think of themselves as such , but they 're not . 
  their purpose is to instill fear . 
  they are terrorists . 
  there is no purpose in twisting words . 
  a terrorist is a terrorist , a martyr is something else . 
   a martyr ( greek : \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2 , m\u00e1rtys , `` witness '' ; stem \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1 - , m\u00e1rtyr - ) is someone who suffers persecution and death for advocating , renouncing , refusing to renounce , or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party . 
  killing infidels is an act of war , not of martyrdom . 
  killing innocent people is an act of terror , the intention is to terrorize the population - not to merely kill a few non-combatants ( * that * would be dumb ) . 
  and the response to that is not letting yourself terrorized - which is the point i was making above . 
  yes , they `` give a fuck about our attitude '' . 
  that 's what they 're desperately trying to change . 
  thanks . 
  does n't seem related to the topic , it 's about financing infrastructure . 
  what happened in romania is ... not clear to anyone . 
  basically , generational change within the legal system and a lot of circumstance in the political area . 
  regaining of international trust during the awful late nineties led to nato and later eu accession , which required some steps be taken . 
  like legal reform , initiated by a president that - probably - mostly wanted his adversaries out of the picture . 
  and then the legal system started to work , most importantly the national anticorruption departement led by kovesi . 
  basescu 's acolytes started to fall too , and the populace ( or part of it ) thought it 's a good idea and worth supporting in the street . 
  politicians on all sides seem largely opposed to the process , with the exception of president iohanis and the newly formed usr . 
  outside support is mostly the cvm . 
  occasionally some eu figures frown when parliament / govt get too brave , but less than versus orban , for example . 
  imho , what keeps things in motion is the pro eu sentiment in a majority of voters , which keeps politicians in check . 
   when romania did theirs the world bank help with it . 
  not sure i understand ? 
   the terrorist do n't give any fuck about our attitude , this is not what martyrdom is about . 
  dude ... they 're called * terrorists * because they try to , you know , * terrorize * people . 
  if martyrdom was the purpose they 'd explode alone in the wilderness . 
  til croatians speak with a bucharest accent . 
  joke of the day : b\u0103sescu speaking from the tribune :  we are all here , adrian n\u0103stase who was pm during negotiations , juncker who signed for the eu , t\u0103riceanu who was pm and me who signed as president . 
  thank god , we are all alive . 
  all - except juncker - are in trouble with the law , and n\u0103stase an ex-convict . 
  ponta ( former pm , also in trouble with the law ) shouts from the audience :  and free !,

   i wonder what shady shit macron , a 39 years old , was doing several decades ago ... ... on minitel . 
  probably his messagerie rose archive , he must have kept it on his campaign servers . 
  they are even [ trying to push a fabrication ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/69bk1l/verified_macron_has_secret_bank_account_in_the/dh5d1c8/ ) about the story being in le monde  reddit has traction with search engines , this is how fake news get popular . 
  turkey accession to the uk confirmed . 
  you are likely referring to transnistria , but there 's a second mini-country within moldova : [ g\u0103g\u0103uzia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauzia ) . 
  let us make the nationalist internationale !, 
   and you have no right to return . 
  that is incorrect . 
  in most countries there is no problem with returning , especially if you still own property there , and no barrier in regaining said citizenship should one decide to move back permanently .

   incas and aztecs were not `` ancient '' the [ olmecs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olmec ) and [ valdivians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdivia_culture ) were , though . 
  some still remember 1990 , when a whole corrupt and murderous regime was brought down at great expense of human life and economic hardship . 
  you know what happened ? 
  the second / third tier politicians managed to secure control of the country , and despite further serious efforts in the streets , won the elections and continue to lead the country twenty years later . 
  the current political crisis ( in the democratic world ) is perhaps the worst on record . 
  previous examples resulted in the replacement of democratic regimes by empires ...

  i was unclear . 
  whenever there 's an article posted about gipsies , for instance , eastern europeans take the heat for being racist . 
  in such occasions , do you think in terms of :  these scum do not , i assure you , do not make up the majority . 
  or do you believe that 's just how things are over there , bunch of racist thugs , better of without them ? 
   these scum do not , i assure you , do not make up the majority . 
  well , hear , hear . 
  does this apply to all those times when eastern europeans get to be called all kinds of shit , from lazy to corrupt to racist ? 
  no , that 's [ cozonac ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=cozonac&amp;btng=suche&amp;hl=de&amp;um=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=941 ) . 
   early neolithic jewelry and female figurines from belica , serbia , to be exhibited for the first time at t\u00fcbingen university museum . 
  it 's a bit of a stretch to call these people ` serbians ' . 
  a stretch of about 6500 years . 
  just as the tartaria people were not romanian either .
