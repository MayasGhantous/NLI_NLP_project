  i thought germany was supposed to be above that . 
  i can attest for that , i have occasionally witnessed dick-drunk hungarians talk , and it was so over my head that i did n't understand a word . 
  i chose the same interpretation , and picked the uk . 
  just add four spaces at the beginning of each line , it 's like a \\ < pre \\  tag . 
  now _ that _ is confusing . 
  in romanian , napolitana is [ a kind of waffle ] ( http://www.culinar.ro/forum/uploads/monthly_08_2008/post-28350-1219897993.jpg ) ... 
  your original claim was :  until now romania was the only country in europe that had successfully preserved bison . 
  this is incorrect . 
  there is no information available if it was ` preserved ' in zoos in romania at all . 
  also , several countries _ except _ romania were releasing wisent in the wild since 1951 . 
  yes , there are wisent reservations in romania ( sometimes the press presents wisent as the ` bour ' of moldavian heraldry , which is incorrect , bour is aurochs ) , but romania played no special role in the preservation and regeneration of the species . 
  the article says bison was extinct in romania some 200 years ago , it eventually disappeared in the wild in the early 20th century , but 50 were preserved in zoos , and are being released in the wild since 1951 . 
  no mention of _ romanian _ zoos . 
  no , it was n't preserverd , read pawmar 's comment . 
  note that the bison ( zimbru ) is not the animal on the moldavian ( and moldovan ) coat of arms . 
  that one is an aurochs ( bour ) , which went extinct even earlier than the bison , sometime in the 17th century , and was not preserved in any way . 
  there is a theory that the tricolor first appeared on documents of [ mihai viteazul ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_the_brave ) , as a combination of the heraldic colors of all territories under his command . 
  [ otherwise ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_flag#history_and_significance_of_the_colors ) :  red , yellow and blue were found on late 16th century royal grants of michael the brave , as well as shields and banners . 
  [ 5 ] during the wallachian uprising of 1821 , they were present on the canvas of the revolutionaries ' flag and its fringes ; for the first time a meaning was attributed to them : `` liberty ( sky-blue ) , justice ( field yellow ) , fraternity ( blood red ) '' . 
  the issue seems to be [ really complicated ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_flag#history ) . 
  more like the greek student ** s ** . 
  there was still a sign in central athens in 2001 advertising classes of ` roumaniko ' , presumably for future students . 
  indeed :  khartoum - the outbreak of violence in the sudanese capital , the german embassy has not unprepared , for days , the diplomats were preparing for the day of wrath . 
  the protest broke out in khartoum , but not because of the spread in the u.s. anti-islamic film `` innocent muslims '' but was aimed directly against germany . 
   since the beginning of this week in sudan islamist preachers and , indirectly , the government called for a massive demonstration in front of the german embassy on this friday . 
  several imams inciting their followers with the statement that would in germany desecrated during demonstrations the image of the holy prophet . 
   quite obviously , the hate preacher played on actions of anti-islamic organizations such as the far-right party klein pro nrw . 
  trailer of pro nrw contributed their rallies in germany already frequently muhammad cartoons with him . 
  pictures of these demos , say observers in khartoum , had incited the masses . 
  surprisingly , the [ english edition ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/protesters-angry-at-muhammad-film-store-german-embassy-in-suda-a-855890.html ) makes no mention of that . 
  from the [ guardian article ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/14/friday-protests-anti-islam-us-film-live ) :  and what has germany done to deserve this ? 
  the general view seems to be that its embassy ( which is next door to the british one ) is easier to reach than the us embassy . 
  perhaps because spanish is easy to learn for romanians , you might just perceive an indistinct foreign accent . 
   romania is the biggest source of immigrants in spain , although spain recently decided to close its borders to romanian immigrants through the end of 2012 . 
  ( from the op , click on spain ), 
  for romania , # 2 is italy . 
  for _ italy _ , # 1 is romania ... 
  but then there 's enough italian people living in romania as well ( not 1 million , though ) . 
  but possibly still an emigration issue ? 
  romanian / hungarian emigres keeping in touch with friends at their place of origin . 
   a few great students who study abroad do not make a good educational system . 
  the average level is what defines the system , not the top 1 % . 
  i have always found that the romanian school system is geared towards top students at the expense of average students . 
  i have been watching this evolve ever since the early seventies when i started primary school . 
  for instance , i learned of sets in fifth grade , but a couple of years later sets were taught in first grade . 
  i have an engineering degree ( bucharest ) , school was very heavy on maths and physics but we only had three practical design tests in the whole five years ... folks at architecture had 12 per semester . 
  i think this illustrates that an otherwise technical school was set up for producing scientists not engineers . 
  i suppose this tendency has roots in the soviet teaching system but has gone wrong at some point . 
  for instance there used to be a college degree ( subingineri ) which should have taken the majority of students ( and fed the factories ) , with a couple percent going to the full degree ( equivalent to a ms , intended for research institutes and such ) , but in the '80s hardly 15 % of the students took the lesser degree . 
  another anecdote - my niece had a computer class in first grade , late '90s : `` a file is a collection of data , a folder is a collection of files '' for kids who could barely write . 
  this approach is a systemic problem , as average pupils are demoralized and discouraged to think . 
  do n't sweat . 
  over here , someone would have stolen that party money and bought themselves a bentley or two . 
  two ladies who were falsifying documents to facilitate bank loans , but the door was installed by the owner of the apt . 
  ( who was not involved in the crime ) . 
  probably just a really good commercial hardened door , certainly not a wooden door as protv folks claim . 
  the real idiots are protv , saying that there was earth in the door or something . 
  watch the second video on the page at cca 40s , the cops are saying the door had a floor strut ( e bagat si _ in _ pamant ) not that there 's earth in the door ( e bagat si pamant ) . 
   there is n't a word ( yet ) for what you are . 
  should n't that be ` neapolitan ' ? 
  question : i 've read that , in basque , the words for ` knife ' and ` stone ' ( or maybe rock ) are related ( have the same root ) . 
  is this correct ? 
  interestingly , there is a `` horses ' easter '' in romania as well , only it 's 40 days _ after _ easter ( i believe todorov den is in the first week of lent ) . 
  it 's a `` lost '' feast , surviving mainly in the expression `` at horses ' easter '' meaning `` never '' . 
  heh ... link to [ that ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf ) directly , dude , 
  [ here ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/p.pdf ) [ pdf , in romanian ] is the official questionnaire for romania 2011 . 
  it does contain one question re faith , in the terms :  what religion does the person considers to belong to ? 
  ( almost just as awkward in romanian ) . 
  to this question people will respond with the general `` faith '' in their family , which simply means they were baptized ( or whatever ) and possibly married in such church or the other . 
  in my direct experience , wolfdgrey 's numbers seem correct ; very few people care enough about religion to even declare themselves atheist , which is also a ` denomination ' highly reminiscent of the communist years ... 
  well , armenia was not entrusted to them by a dying president , you know , these things matter . 
  indeed , the copyright on the term _ must _ have expired by now . 
  i remember some very nice beaches south of sozopol ... 
  did n't like the north seaside , though , in one place you had to wear beach shoes up to 50m away in the water until you could swim ( no sand at all , just rocks ) . 
  was it tuzlata , i ca n't remember . 
  almost 30 years ago ... 
  no , he said ` dou\u00e3 degete de frunte ' . 
  not being sarcastic , wikipedia really says it better than i could : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sighi%c8%99oara http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sibiu, 
  nevermind bucharest - though it 's my home town - just go to sibiu and sighisoara . 
  well , after that you may come to bucharest as well , it 's interesting in so many ways , and if i 'm not on vacation i 'll be glad to buy you a couple of beers . 
  what , having musical preferences ? 
  god save the queen , and das deutschlandlied . 
  yes , that 's how tea is prepared , but you rednecks could n't even get that right . 
  one uses boiling sweet water , not the fucking sea . 
  what series is it from ? 
  a bit of fry and laurie , i suppose ? 
   yes , but they are made in cannes . 
   i came for the eastern european xenophobes , and i was not disappointed !, 
  per webster , xenophobia is ` fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign ' . 
  picking up an event in a remote place , and extending to half a continent , fits the definition . 
   [ adrian nastase ] quit the prime minister position in dec. / '04 ... and is about to take a well deserved two-year long vacation . 
  also :  around 100,000 germans fled before the soviet red army , but romania did not conduct the expulsion of germans as did neighboring countries at war 's end . 
  however , more than 70,000 saxons were arrested by the soviet army and sent to labour camps in ukraine for alleged cooperation with germany . 
  i was pretty surprised to read otherwise in the op ... 
  oh dear  thanks !, 
  i read something about the kke splitting some time ago between traditionalists and ` neo ' communists ( or something like that ) , i thought it was about that . 
  what does ' \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 ' mean , i thought it stands for ` stalinists ' ? 
  i suppose it 's a play on [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwie_sjkeay ) . 
  edit : and the [ nutty walk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-uywae0nhq#t=53s ), 
  as the article says , effort and productivity are not the same thing .
