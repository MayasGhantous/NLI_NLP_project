  germany is in europe . 
   independent from church centers in the vatican actually , from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_catholic#juridical_status ) :  canonically , each eastern catholic church is sui iuris or autonomous with respect to other catholic churches , whether eastern or latin , though ** all accept the spiritual and juridical authority of the pope ** . 
  not really independent . 
   you make good on your word , period . 
  that 's brutto . 
  the net salary for that is [ circa 150 eur ] ( http://www.calculatorsalariu.ro/?action=calcs2&amp;suma=900 ) . 
  they lost both times ... 
  in 1982 quite [ controversially ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_germany_vs_france_%281982%29#controversy ) , [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=tgq7vcahoqo#t=78 ) . 
  some lucky days to regret . 
   the horse meat thing is a jab at the 2013 minced meat scandal that contained horse meat in stead of the cow the packaging said . 
  and where the romanian producer was exonerated , [ french company spanghero ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20130214-france-french-firm-inquiry-horsemeat-beef/ ) being the one at fault . 
   there is no point of guessing what russian intentions are if in couple of weeks after all information is available we 'll see if they lift this ban or not . 
  the fact is , i ca n't even find data on romanian beef exports to russia ( germany exported some [ 2,000 tons in 2013 ] ( http://www.eblex.org.uk/market-intelligence-news/declining-german-beef-and-veal-exports-in-2013/ ) , in steep decline over the past few years ) . 
  it ca n't be a lot , as the difference between production and consumption was about 1,000 tones in romania in 2013 , and a huge export contract was signed [ with china ] ( http://www.thecattlesite.com/news/44524/china-agrees-500000-cattle-and-3-million-pig-deal-with-romania ) . 
  and there is ample evidence with past such bans from russia ( ukrainian sweets , moldovan wine , etc. ), 
  that it 's an expression of political hostility barely disguised as safety concern . 
  aaand the writers ... bborges , cortazar , casares , sabato are all argentinian . 
   germany - atypical bse cases ( l and h-types ) . 
  laboratory confirmation of the first case in january 2014 in a bovine slaughtered on 30 december 2013 . 
  data as of 25 february 2014 . 
  i did n't hear of any ban on german beef , which , according to your logic , should have happened with twice the cases . 
   outbreak is a term used in epidemiology to describe an occurrence of disease greater than would otherwise be expected at a particular time and place . 
  it may affect a small and localized group or impact upon thousands of people across an entire continent . 
  ** two linked cases ** of a rare infectious disease may be sufficient to constitute an outbreak . 
  but it 's just the one ... 
  so no , there is no outbreak registered , just one case . 
  i only had 2 months during uni . 
  these things change , i was only sure of primary school . 
  actually , it 's the only way you guys can meet this wc . 
  here 's hoping to that !, 
  same in romania . 
  the three months long holiday was cool , though , back in primary school , 
  when i posted that , discussions on this page were revolving around work . 
  it 's not a break from work , just primary school . 
  important detail : [ the data refer to ** primary education ** in the member states of the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k95xg4n.jpg ) ( full size image ) . 
  the quote is out of context , as i explained [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/27a8wz/am_intilnit_si_nemti_idioti_azi_klaus_iohannis/chyvrrv?context=3 ) ( in romanian ) . 
  he was referring to * local budget * losses ( which local budgets are based 50 % on income taxes ) . 
  as far as i can tell , his worst shortcomings are being inarticulate , and perhaps a lack of charisma . 
  i used to work with russian electronics components , including microprocessors , but never anything like [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbrus_%28computer%29 ) , 
  how do the numbers compare ? 
  and is there any polish or american minority stirring shit in ukraine ? 
  was ukrainian territory recently annexed by either poland or america ? 
  context is everything . 
  moldova 's problem is with transnistria , a runaway region under russian control , as stated in your article . 
  and border guards have no tanks , planes or artillery , not anywhere near what russia is deploying . 
  moldova do not `` have their army at the border '' as you claim , they simply have the border guards on alert . 
  board guards are police , as your link says ( through google translate ) . 
  what 's * your * point ? 
   the soviets tried the `` not invented here '' approach and failed miserably . 
  they did n't , really . 
  they built clones of i8080 , i8086 and z80 ( along with the ddr ) , and those were based on industrial espionage and `` chip cloning '' - they had technology to `` read '' the internals of a chip , i worked with a guy formerly with iprs who 'd seen such in the ussr days . 
   for example moldova . 
  did you actually read that article before linking to it ? 
  it 's not troops but border guards , and it 's in relation with transnistria , which is controlled by russia . 
   i would argue that nato has always been hostile towards russia with a brief intermission after the fall of the soviet union indeed , it was actually formed to counter the soviets . 
  the `` brief intermission '' lasted for some 20 years , though . 
  the recent perception of hostility is i think distorted , the enlargement was thought to be proactive , when in fact it was reactive to eastern european enthusiasm to join nato . 
  take a look at [ this map of the duchy of moscow ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/muscovy_1390_1525.png ) ( the dark area ) , a tributary ( buffer zone ? ), 
  to the golden horde even when it occupied the larger lighter area . 
  pretty far from crimea , innit ? 
  yes , i get the military implications . 
  what i 'm saying is they are not * entitled * to control smaller nations just to make sure they wo n't get invaded by unexpected hostile coalitions in the future . 
  the nukes should be enough . 
  and the smaller nations * are * entitled to choose their own partners . 
  nato was not * hostile * to russia , quite the contrary . 
  at least until georgia . 
   edit : corrected after understanding better what 's the situation in eastern europe . 
  i 'm taking back my downvote . 
  upvote for the civility ( and * not * for agreeing with me ) . 
   the reason why russia has always been expansionist is because the need a large buffer zone , and the reason they need a large buffer zone is so they can expel invaders . 
  so where does that stop ? 
  will it ever ? 
   the reason that they ** need ** a large buffer zone no , that 's the reason why they * want * a buffer zone , and they do want one because of the belicose and expansionist nature of russian foreign politics for the past few centuries . 
  everyone is a potential enemy , because at some point we may want their wrist watches ( ok , that was just mean , but i 'll leave it there ) . 
  so they were invaded by germany in wwii . 
  so was belgium - in both world wars , while being neutral . 
  where 's * their * buffer zone ? 
  do you hear a lot of people where you 're from calling anyone inconvenient a fascist ? 
  ( besides the russian immigrants , that is ) . 
  heck , we paid the eu membership hard - for us . 
  prices for everyday things like water , electricity , gas , went high up as companies were sold to multinationals , and prices are in the process of being aligned with european ones , in a country where the average earnings is half ~ ~ your ~ ~ the portuguese unemployment benefits . 
  we have to face the distrust and spite of other european nations , with all the immigration issues , horse meat scandals ( turned out it was a french company ) , infested milk ( turned out it was a german farm ) , and so on . 
  the result ? 
  no euro-skeptics whatsoever . 
  guess why ? 
  i am saying they already did , and that by wide popular will . 
  there was not a single party in romania ( and i guess in the rest of eastern europe ) for the past 24 years that would even try to advocate anything other than joining nato and the eu . 
  and there was ample disagreement on all other things but those . 
   i 'm not saying that , i 'm just saying ** it is expected ** you do n't say ? 
  were we supposed to sit and swallow ? 
  are we being offensive in trying to distance ourselves from the hippopotamus ? 
  no , really , what * are * you trying to say ? 
   extend the buffer states all the way to portugal now * that * will disturb some people 's siesta . 
   expanding toward russia borders buffer nations those buffer nations * asked * for nato , and would rather be buffer nations for the eu than russia . 
  but i admit that 's hard to grasp from as far away from russia as portugal .
