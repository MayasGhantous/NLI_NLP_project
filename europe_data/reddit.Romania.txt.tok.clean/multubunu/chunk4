  and / r/rocirclejerk , / r/rocringe , / r/rolistentothis , / r/romaniaporn ( sfw ) , / r/rofoto , / r/robyte , to list * some * of the active ones . 
  i genuinely thought all regional subreddits are like that , not trying to be an ass . 
  ( edit ) / r/france seems about as active as / r/romania , and / r/unitedkingdom looks about twice as productive ( but with ~ 15 times the userbase ) . 
  it was n't you , it was us ... 
   here the communist party is illegal it 's not , there just is n't one . 
  it was illegal for a couple of hours , in the night of 12-13 january 1990 , and i take pride in the fact that i had a contribution to that , however dispensable it was . 
  i suppose we 're using different terms for the same thing . 
  the people who vote for their jailed-for-corruption mayor , are , to me , [ corrupt ] ( http://dexonline.ro/definitie/corup%c8%9bie ) as well . 
  you know , the guy * did * steal , but at least he did something . 
  you seem to call the same thing * bacwards * or * ultra-orthodox * . 
  i really do n't see anything dangerous in the old ladies kissing dead body parts . 
   a pm i suppose you mean an mp , and that would be remus cernea . 
  the guy is a fraud , he just caters to his voters ' demographic , i.e. 
  you . 
  if one wants to get difficult legislation through parliament , they first * prepare * somehow . 
  cernea is the guy who proposed two `` difficult '' laws , one about gays and one about church ( a couple of years ago ) - at the same time . 
  that 's not the way to get things ~ ~ down ~ ~ done , but it sure helps get the young people votes . 
  oh , almost forgot - cernea was also proposing a law to give dolphins `` non-human person '' status . 
  right , so you 're the one progressive person in parliament , and this is the way you go ? 
   decriminalizing weed is it really a priority ? 
  how about reforming the schooling system ? 
  like finding ways to lock up forever people like the teacher that was filmed asking parents for money , and is now suing the education dept. 
  for being * unduly * fired ? 
  because the legal system does not cover her case ? 
  and the lack of * personal * responsibility for officials ? 
  like oprescu being able to demolish * hala matache * , lose the trial and pay for it from public money ? 
  and who will pay for demolishing cathedral plazza , oprescu or the tax payers ? 
  dude , the day will come when weed will be legal ( not just decriminalized ) and dolphins will enjoy the benefits of citizenship . 
  but we have bigger fish to fry just yet . 
   romania was a good friend of the empire until 1916 yes , they were allies , german king and all . 
  and i 'll give you that , if you 're gon na be friends with someone in the xix-th century , from the romanian pov you can choose between a-h , russia and the ottomans . 
  not much to choose from . 
  i wo n't contest the `` top holiday destination '' bit , i suppose you have evidence for that , but it does n't prove much . 
  rebreanu - an * ardelean * - seems to say otherwise . 
  we seem to have forgotten the sense of unity our grand parents seem to have had , and i believe that 's wrong . 
  corruption . 
  we 've made great strides in the last 25 years , there 's a lot left to go . 
  we 're on it , though . 
   basically invent modern romanian not to rain on your parade , but budai-deleanu admits to improve his romanian from moldavia , in his words the center of romanian culture ( from the notes to my edition of the * \u021aiganiada * ) . 
  `` modern '' romanian ( aka franco-italian imports ) has a lot more to do with the likes of alecsandri , and even the first kingdom was started by moldavian militants , and wallachians to a slightly lesser degree . 
  out `` here '' ( outside the ardeal ) , austria-hungary was seen as an evil empire , much like in kafka or svejk . 
  [ here 's a bas-relief ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/52009196.jpg ) of maria-thereza `` under '' a horse ridden by death , a depiction of a romanian ( kingdom ) urban legend of her death ( cinema dacia , near gara de nord , bucure\u0219ti ) . 
  i agree , but i doubt the president reads these boards . 
  potato ? 
   glorious belarus do n't be an ass . 
  the eu would be better off with belarus on its side , rather than the current arrangement . 
  and there 's precious few redditors from belarus here , they can bring unique insight to our conversations , it 's expensive to drive them away for the sake of frivolous jokes . 
  nope . 
  romanian , as the flag says  thanks .

  norwegian not bad , eh ? 
  we call them * ardei * ( read : * ardey * ) , derived from the verb * arde * ( to burn ) . 
  it would be interesting to see a map of this ... paging mr. b  the poweder is called * boia [ de ardei ] * , related to the verb * boi * ( to paint ) . 
  no , he just listed all the taxes he could think of . 
  according to my payroll document i pay roughly 36 % , and that 's `` flat '' ( same for all incomes ) . 
  there 's an extra for health insurance , but as i see on my pay roll , it 's fully paid by my employer ( not deducted from my salary ) . 
  my employer pays another ~ 30 % of my brutto for me that is not taken from my salary , but rather from his revenue . 
  overall , only 54 % of the money that are payed by my employer for me eventually end up in my pocket . 
  the employer also pays other taxes like profit 16 % , etc. 
  that are not per-employee taxes and there 's a 24 % vat , which is sort of outside this conversation , but we pay it nonetheless . 
  there are other taxes as well , like property taxes and whatnot . 
  that is how we feel about spanish and italian . 
  the correct word is ** parlament ** in both cases . 
  parlament * ul * means * the * parliament . 
  oh , i think it 's a * good * idea to have the date in the title , i was simply trying to explain the post above . 
  everybody knows gypsies are fascist . 
  they can call it the nationalist international . 
   gogo\u0219i a word of unknown origin , implying we 've been making those forever . 
  as a fun fact , the word has a metaphorical meaning of * lies * , so in romanian literally the donut is a lie . 
  dude , it 's all in jest . 
  we 're supposed to be descendants of dacians ( which is taught in school ) , which were the original civilisation of europe ( which is fortunately * not * taught in school , but there are those who claim it anyway ) . 
  here 's a glass of wine to your flag , and all the romanian folk who think they 're better than the rest of us because their area benefited from austrian influence  ^ ^ ^ ^ ... and ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ such ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ great ^ ^ ^ ^ feeling ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ leave ^ ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ behind ^ ^ ^ ^ , 
   the empire as it is ... was ? 
   and no , not really . 
  there was a holy roman empire , sort of started by charlemagne ( france , avant la lettre ) and named after rome ( italy ) , that did n't have much to do with austria except being ruled by german folks most of its history ; but that was a rather fluid place and hardly a state per se . 
  the capitol city ( or seat of the emperor , or diet ) was variously in aachen , regensburg , frankfurt , or prague . 
  even the austrian empire proper was not that monolithic , many parts of it were in ` personal union ' , like the czech kingdom if memory serves . 
  but it 's perhaps safe to say that the austrian empire - such as it lasted - was a successor of sorts of this for perhaps about a century - before the austro-hungarian empire was established , that lasted some 50 years itself . 
   the leftist point is that you have to work for someone else under his own conditions oddly enough , their solution seems to be a system where you can not work for yourself under your own conditions ( the rightist * someone else * is replaced by * society * or * community * or something to that effect ) . 
   the austrian empire exists since the 12th century if i remember correctly . 
  you do n't , apparently :  [ the ** austrian empire ** ( austrian german : * kaiserthum oesterreich * , modern spelling * kaisertum \u00d6sterreich * ) was created out of the realms of the habsburgs by proclamation in 1804 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_empire ), 
  i 'm not so sure it 's `` crazy votes '' , more like people that would n't support the main parties and go with the first `` best choice '' of the rest . 
  normally , that 's the crazies , or else some populist . 
  what 's interesting right now in romania is that the far-right lacks charismatic leaders . 
  in 2012 , prm dropped out of parliament and were replaced nearly 1:1 by ppdd , a sort of silly populist party ( a point on their platform was the govt will give 20,000 euros to each citizen or something like that ) . 
  but the guy ( dd ) lost his television 's license , so his party lost traction ( no visibility ) . 
  so now you have mircea diaconu ( an actor with some shady things in his past ) gathering votes for almost two seats , probably mainly because of the recent controversy surrounding him ( that kept him on tv ) .
