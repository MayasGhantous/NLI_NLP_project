  if my reasoning is correct , all this only shows that the votes for the far-right around europe do n't mean that everybody went nuts , it 's just that people try to vote with `` somebody else '' and it just happens that the far-right is there with the populist message . 
  in romania , prm had 20 % of the vote in 2000 ; if those were all from crazies , they would have voted them in today at roughly the same percentage . 
  more importantly , the far right prm got a whooping 2.7 % , and silly/populist ppdd - 3.6 % , both too low to get any seats . 
  it was also felt in bucharest ( as a 3 ) , the first time this happens with a quake in the aegean . 
  [ from russia today ] ( http://rt.com/business/160068-china-russia-gas-deal/ ) :  assuming the overall price of the contract includes only the cost of supplies of russian gas , than the $ 400 billion price tag means china will pay about $ 350 per 1,000 cubic meters . 
  some 10 % cheaper than gas sold to the eu . 
  it will be subsequently known as * bertchegne sur mer * , 
   got ta start saving money for a yacht . 
  nah , just take one from england , they wo n't be needing them anymore . 
   and bucharest drowns . 
  actually , [ it just gets a beach ] ( http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=44.4388,26.1114&amp;zoom=12&amp;m=60 ) . 
  yeah , that 's why it was possible to subscribe from romania , we were aware of that . 
  but it did n't do any politics , and frankly , it was a so much better kids ' magazine than disney comics . 
  tintin is much older ( that 's why i linked to the translation section ) . 
  asterix is french , although both creators worked for belgian comics as well . 
  asterix , and more than him , pif gadget were available and quite popular in romania in the seventies/eighties , which has nothing to do with the subject but i felt like sharing  . 
  one [ * tintin * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_adventures_of_tintin#translation_into_english ) might have played a part as well . 
  20,000 workers will wear an armband * during work * to show their action continues . 
  `` go to work but do nothing '' is known here as * italian strike * ( different from the [ wikipedia definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_strike ) ) . 
   people doing nothing at work , but still showing up in romania it means continuing to work while wearing some kind of sign that says you 're unhappy . 
  an armband according to the article . 
  what you are describing is known here as * italian strike * . 
   victor ponta on friday said that word for the wise : if you find that phrase in any article , stop reading , it is pointless . 
  the guy is a pathological liar . 
   they * buy * property that 'll be the day . 
  some are nice : - netherlands : * real man wear orange * - russia : * no one can catch us *, 
  do n't forget to check out [ the musical ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht-dmdc7bkw ) . 
  no , but [ it 's headed there ] ( http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do;jsessionid=71129e438584c0bfb5f422de9ed8b2d0?node=9485586&amp;series_key=121.gst.a.ro.n.b1300.pdf.b0000.cu.n ) . 
  ... that 's why people wear flairs , 
  so 's romania . 
  we 're talking ez . 
   the instability of the ron to put numbers to that , since 07/05/2009 [ the ron lost less than 7 % to the euro ] ( http://www.cursbnr.ro/grafic.php?currency=eur&amp;from=2009-04-06&amp;until=2014-05-07 ) , with a maximum ripple ( max - min ) of ~ 11 % ( per natl bank records ) . 
  public debt/gdp was [ 37 % in 2012 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt ) . 
  it 's lower now , as it 's being [ paid off ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24y2bn/romania_completes_this_year_paying_back_the_imf/ ) . 
  * external * ( public + private ) debt/gdp [ was 67 % in 2012 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt ) , vs 142 for germany , for instance . 
  it 's in the table you linked below  only denmark and lithuania fulfill that . 
  oh , i thought your post was the `` it was shit , now it 's shawrma '' meme , an opinion to which i do not agree . 
  if you re-read my post with that in mind , you will see it 's also a reply to that . 
  basically , `` if you do a little research , you will find that to be wrong '' . 
  i even managed to squeeze a `` going north '' bit ( as opposed to the `` southern influence '' which kebap is associated with ) . 
  yeah , that 's why i posted this . 
  i 've seen the odd hailstorm over the years , but never something like [ this ] ( http://image.stirileprotv.ro/media/images/620xx/may2014/61509172.jpg ) . 
  the rain was [ something special ] ( http://image.stirileprotv.ro/media/images/620xx/may2014/61509397.jpg ) as well . 
  it has historically been a commercial area , that 's why all streets have trade names , like * bl\u0103nari * ( fur traders ) , * \u0218elari * ( leather tarders ) or * lipscani * ( meaning traders in merchandise from lipsca , old name for leipzig ) . 
  of course not . 
  just look at the buildings . 
  the former * b\u0103cani * bazar was on - you wo n't believe this - * b\u0103cani street * at the corner with * lipscani * , quite a distance from the shop in your second pic ( * \u0218elari * with * francez\u0103 * ) . 
  in [ this view ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/lvrqk ) you can see the former clujana shop right behind the crane ( it is at the right side of op 's pic ) , while the `` bazar '' was in the low rise building along * b\u0103cani street * , going north from the blue roof near the crane . 
  in [ this view ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/mmtqm ) op 's pic location is top-right , dristor kebap is bottom-left . 
  i fail to see any redeeming qualities in stalin . 
  it 's not him who kicked the nazi 's ass , it 's the russian people , with great sacrifice ; and that mostly in spite of stalin , who famously purged the army of qualified officers just before the war . 
  a social state in stalin 's terms is [ forced collectivisation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_the_soviet_union ) followed by [ widespread famine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) , [ and gulag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag ) , and that was the point of my post above . 
  what has yeltsin got to do with stalin 's `` social state '' ? 
   may 1 was chosen as the date for international workers ' day by the socialists and communists of the second international to commemorate the [ haymarket affair ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haymarket_affair ) in chicago that occurred on may 4 , 1886 . 
  [ 2 ] we have a natl holiday too . 
  not many red flags though . 
  the pic , sure , but not the guy holding it . 
   and they do n't get the [ social state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) to go with it . 
  i suppose * that * 's the reason they love putin . 
  oops , that was affairs . 
  fixed . 
  or , speaking seriously , people tend to give the answer they consider socially acceptable , even anonymously . 
  ~ ~ nor poland , 71 % versus 72 % in russia . ~ ~ also , do n't drink in russia . 
  44 % of russians consider alcohol consumption unacceptable , the biggest percentage in all surveyed countries . 
  i 've never been to brno , but they seem to have a slang/dialect specific to the city , called [ hantetz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hantec ) . 
   share our love of pilsener and know how to brew it very well they [ invented it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pils ) , so there 's that . 
   thanks . 
  no idea how they 're viewed in romania today . 
  in the past there was a lot of sympathy/respect for the prague spring , also for 1990 and after . 
  czech literature was also widely published , both before ( hasek , capek ) and after 1990 ( michnik , kundera etc. ) . 
  in my generation svejk had a decent fanbase , and it was always fun to meet a new person that would respond to * you have only known my good side * with * you are a simulant * , with outsiders baffled , even more so when you would part with * see you after the war , at 6pm * - * yeah , at the chalice * . 
  if you do n't clean you room , [ mommy will call * him * in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dm2th9l.jpg ) !, 
  crimean tatars . 
  romanian , but distorted to sound like portuguese . 
  [ amigos cona\u00e7ao de ce ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc8kmuvp4qu ) , 
  not * all * the eu , 
  odessa was always outside romania , and i wager it 's why we ( or moldova ) lost southern bessarabia in the first place ( 1878 ) - too close to a russian city at the black sea . 
  we got dobruja instead , so i 'm not mad - about * that * . 
  he means aromanians ( aka vlachos in greek ) . 
   vlachs are just small entity in serbia that live there , but do n't consider themselves romanians it 's really complicated . 
  the word * vlach * is of germanic origin and was used historically to identify neighbouring ( to the germanics ) romanized populations . 
  cognates include walloon and welsh . 
  the poles call italians * w\u0142ochi * . 
  now the vlachs in serbia are no different from romanians ( at least linguistically ) , they just choose a different identity - i remember some exchanges with one of them here . 
  she posted some links to various vlach language sites ; it 's really a form of archaic romanian with a heavy banat ( sw romania ) accent ( the serbian-like alphabet allows that to be recognized ) . 
  i can understand in excess of 90 % of the language ( there 's some serbisms in there ) , and there 's a couple of archaic grammatical features like infinitive instead of indicative in certain contexts , but otherwise fully understandable . 
  not to be confused with [ aromanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanian_people ) , also referred to as vlachs ( see above ) , but a distinct population with a different romance language ( partially mutually understandable with romanian ) . 
  thanks !, 
  nah , thank * you *  actually , there 's still plenty of beggars . 
  what has changed is the [ street-corner crooks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djfko-0vjb0 ) and pick-pockets , at least here in bucharest . 
  but there has been an increase in police enforcing as well , so it 's not clear if you `` took '' them all , or a large part are in jail . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojrgc8pmqu8 there are several documentaries , this is the most well known . 
  [ yes ] ( http://translate.google.com/#bg/en/%d1%85%d0%b8%d0%bb%d1%8f%d0%b4%d0%b0 ) . 
  [ lol ] ( http://www.libertatea.ro/typo3temp/pics/bancnota_260b35e9e2.jpg ) ( now worth 100 lei ) . 
  i have relatives in eastern romania that used to make it . 
  perhaps it 's only made in some regions . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.pensiunituristicebucovina.ro/mancaruri_traditionale_bucovina.php ) it is listed as a traditional dish in bucovina , and [ here ] ( http://www.flancointeractiv.ro/viata-cu-flanco/acasa/item/992-obiceiuri-culinare-de-paste-din-diverse-regiuni-ale-tarii ) it is listed as originary from oltenia , but later spread to moldova . 
  we do n't have a * significant * turkish minority either , but considering the size of bucharest , you get to see some . 
  so there 's a halal butchery here and there , and they 're good places to shop for non-pork meat , with pork being the preferred meat around here . 
  although you can find more [ quality ] beef lately in supermarkets as well , not mutton though .
