  we are about to move and i am really looking forward to start cooking again ( better kitchen ahead ) . 
   * stufat * is a southern thing and i guess eastern ( moldavian ) too . 
  it 's a spring meal seen as you do n't get green onion/garlic in other seasons . 
  i had no idea it 's not made in ardeal . 
  do you eat mutton in bihor ? 
  it 's rather unusual here , quite surprising for people who descend from shepherds . 
  i really like it , but you can only get it from turkish butchers outside of easter feasts . 
  perhaps op 's picture is a bit misleading . 
  drob is sort of lamb haggis , it 's prepared of minced lamb offal ( * m\u0103runtaie * ) stuffed into the lamb 's caul ( * prapure * ) and baked in the oven . 
  the eggs in op 's pic are optional ( i never ate something like that ) . 
  not ot be confused with * drob de sare * aka * salt boulder * . 
  mutton is not big in romania , strange for people claiming to descend from shepherds , but that 's it . 
  you need to buy your lamb a couple of days before easter , or you wo n't find any , as nobody buys it after easter , so supermarkets do n't stock on it . 
  you can still monitor your neighbourhood turkish butchers . 
  [ * cozonac * ] ( http://www.divainbucatarie.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cozonac-cu-crema-de-nuci-si-ciocolata.jpg ) shaped as [ * colac * ] ( http://s020.radikal.ru/i714/1305/c4/3089a312992d.jpg ) . 
  the balkans are a single nation , i guess . 
  i 'll add * stufat * , stewed lamb ribs , green onions and green garlic . 
  [ not a looker ] ( http://www.all-food.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/stufat-de-miel-all-food.jpg ) , but an excellent meal that is traditionally made for easter . 
  that , and [ professor balthazar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h31vwbkmosc ) !, 
   `` ground walnut '' stands for peanut  i did n't think of that , we call peanuts * ground hazelnuts * . 
  i meant ground as in participle of * to grind * . 
   a mix of dried tomato , basil and garlic that sounds delicious , is there a commercial product ? 
  perhaps i can find that in a supermarket here . 
  what 's it called in polish ? 
  you can always call them eggs milanese , or maybe eggs piccata . 
  but since you asked for wisdom , here 's something to try next time : add some coarse-ground wallnuts to the coating mix . 
  as an extra , you can also sprinkle a pinch of ground hard white cheese ( like parmigiano ) during cooking , as soon as the coating starts getting brown . 
  i 'd rather replace vegeta with a little coarse salt in the coating mix and sprinkled ground [ tri-color pepper ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/pepper-multicolor-whole-seeds-10410184.jpg ) when done cooking , and lose the mayo and ketchup , but to each their own . 
  there are some moldovans who think of themselves as distinct from romanians ( and they are entitled to that ) . 
  i am of the opinion that the distinction is insignificant , but would n't start a crusade over that . 
  and i had the impression that my post sounded `` colonialist '' as it was ( which was not meant to ) . 
  [ salami tactics ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ix_d_vmkswe#t=72 ) . 
  people should really watch * yes , [ prime ] minister * . 
  funny and revealing at the same time . 
   moldova get 's it 's south region back it would be way more useful than anything trasnistria has to offer - sea opening , territorial waters in the black sea with oil/gas beneath , and access to the danube . 
  but it 's not going to happen , and not for anything of the above , but for the reason romania lost that territory in the first place in 1878 - it 's too close to odessa . 
  on the other hand , i 'm more worried about the romanians ( or moldovans , i mean no offense ) in transnistria , who have a terrible time as it is . 
  same in romania . 
  as long as you 're just an employee , everything is handled by your employer . 
  you just receive an already filled form once a year . 
  if you are employed but have some other revenue , you have to fill some extra fields in above form and pay some extra tax . 
  one can also choose a status similar to what you call `` private entrepreneur '' ( * freelancer * , really ) and pay a number of taxes monthly ( i believe ) . 
  many in the it business go this way . 
  the camera moves all the time , but when it 's stable i 'd say 10-20 people go out of the image every second , depending on how thick is the column . 
  there 's 227 seconds of video , it does n't start with the front of the column and it ends before the end of the march ( the column is pretty thick at the end of the clip ) . 
  i 'd say some 3000 in the video , possibly double or more in the whole event . 
  the point of my post is that the source of that particular piece of news does n't seem very credible . 
  the site for this post , ruvesna.su ( aka * russian spring * with the soviet union domain ) was established about a month ago and contains such things as [ advice for russians traveling to ukraine to help separatists ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/13/russia-tells-tourists-how-to-go-fight-in-ukraine.html ) . 
   i 'd rather have a mars without russia . 
  well , it 's the red planet , right ? 
  so it 's rightfully theirs . 
  seriously though , how about colonizing siberia ? 
  it 's 26 times the area of sweden and only three times the population , and the climate in the south is not that different from moscow . 
  not necessarily heavenlike , but better than mars . 
  yes . 
  it appears they 're not a nationality , but a sect . 
  reminiscent of [ that lady ] ( http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/russian-government-allegedly-plants-actress-anti-revolution-ukrainian ) . 
   i ca n't for the life of me figure out why he 's engaging the press he is n't . 
  the whole article is `` a member of congress said '' and `` a member of the staff said '' this and that about what breedlove said . 
  some classified briefings are quoted as well , which the author clearly did n't attend . 
  there 's also something from a written testimony to congress that was not delivered . 
  the only thing coming directly from the man 's mouth is nothing like the rest of the article :  in a statement for the daily beast , breedlove acknowledged that he met with members of both parties in congress in the last week in march . 
  `` ** i provided my estimation of russian capabilities and that estimation was well-received by the members . 
  as these sessions were classified , i can only get into generalities . 
  ** '' breedlove added that he discussed a number of issues including the u.s. consideration of non-lethal aid to ukraine . 
  `` ** i was clear that our efforts were aimed at reassuring our nato allies and european partners of our commitment and resolve ** , '' he said . 
  sadly , no . 
  sure . 
  dostoyevski , chaikovski , gogol were all great , and nazi germany would never have been defeated without the russian/soviet effort and sacrifice . 
  it 's just that nothing of that is news , and this site is a news agregator . 
  i am flattered . 
  thanks !, 
   avoiding each other when it comes to direct conflict however , they did have war by proxy in korea , vietnam and afghanistan . 
  [ luxemburgism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxemburgism ) , based on the writings of [ rosa luxemburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosa_luxemburg ) , a german citizen . 
   i have n't heard of a case in which they 've done something like that outside bucharest . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/romaniaporn/top e : no , really , there 's plenty of beautiful pics there ... 
  [ see also ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
  it probably looks like weiss bier . 
  ca n't say about the taste though . 
   there are more russians than romanians living there now that 's not why they would n't let go , it 's the same reason they wanted it in the first place : proximity to odesa and access to the danube delta . 
  they * do * have a flag , though . 
  do you have a source ? 
  i 'd be really interested to read this in detail . 
   187 $ in russia before the ruble 's devaluation ? 
   i recall watching a documentary on them i remember that too , there was a post on / r/romania a while ago . 
  as i remember , they were north of romania and had hungarian influences in the language . 
  the exonym is volohi or volohove . 
  he 's not the only one to be unimpressed . 
  [ only two weeks ago ] ( http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/6763/print ) :  question : how do you see the future of crimea ? 
  do you consider the possibility of it joining russia ? 
   vladimir putin : no , we do not . 
   it was a reference to ostap bender / ilf & petrov . 
  anyways , whatever you choose to do , that 's fine , but i really think russia needs people like you , russia like the russian people , not that much the current govt . 
  you are one of those that made that difference clear on these forums - russia is not putin . 
  whatever you choose to do , i wish you the best of luck !, 
  only 93 % ?? 
  the crimean authorities have some explaining to do . 
   good luck !, 
  19th century fantasy . 
  it even has an ottoman empire of sorts .
