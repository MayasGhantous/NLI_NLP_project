   ukraine = perfect country for farming . 
  and most of southern russia , and a third of romania . 
  btw , chernozem literally means `` black soil '' in russian , depicting humus . 
  sorry for being offtopic , but what 's the deal with ` heathcliff ' all over the english translation ? 
  seems to be the translation of ` lenta ' ( which i thought meant ` tape ' ? ), 
  not that i know of . 
  anyway , it 's an [ e-3a awacs ] ( http://adevarul.ro/international/europa/infografie-avion-radar-nato-pazeste-cerul-romaniei-1_531f59a40d133766a8d092da/index.html ) ( link in romanian ) , i.e. 
  a manned [ boeing e-3a sentry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_e-3_sentry#variants ) . 
  no , he was a [ romanian poet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandru_macedonski ) :p, 
  i 'll try to fix the translation . 
  `` without parole '' really means without probation , they really go to jail . 
  it has become a habit in the romanian press to specify that , as many of the convictions in corruption cases are suspended sentence . 
  well , they used to be , now most are `` time served '' . 
  the convicts * will * be eligible for parole after serving half the sentence ( or less in certain circumstances ) . 
  the offense `` giving unauthorized persons access to information not intended for publicity '' translates more closely to `` giving access to confidential information '' . 
  the whole case is around a situation where a contest for high-ranking positions in the legal system was won by two people who knew the questions to the test , as they had been provided by others sentenced today . 
  in czech they also stress the first syllable . 
   can someone edit wiki ? 
   yes , everybody including you . 
  you should make an account and login before editing though , or else your ip will show in the history page . 
  make sure to leave references to your edits . 
  read these pages first : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:editing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:editing_policy, 
  an expression well represented in eastern europe . 
  in romania we say ` such a beautiful country , such a shame it 's inhabited ' ( of ourselves , not poland ) . 
  i like to call this attitude the eastern bipolar narcissism . 
  bipolar , because you frequently hear the other extreme along the lines of ` we 're the best there is and the rest are useless ' . 
   later , a ukrainian officer told a daily telegraph journalist that the stand-off had ended after the `` talks '' , and that the russian lorries and about 30 to 60 russians troops had withdrawn . 
  no shots are believed to have been fired . 
  it 's the [ official name ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/podul_calafat-vidin ) . 
  the giurgiu-ruse bridge is named `` friendship bridge '' , 
  that 's tragic , really . 
  the people of chechnya seem to [ have taken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chechen_war ) an interest in their self-determination for some time . 
  regardless , why * would n't * they want independence ? 
  that , of course , if you were certain of the outcome . 
  which implies the russians are n't . 
  oh , that 's not what i was saying . 
  everybody seems to take it for granted that eastern ukraine can hardly wait to get `` back '' to russia . 
  but it 's not that clear cut , imho . 
  a quick and dirty grab of crimea might make eastern ukrainians loathe russia . 
  i guess we 'll just wait and see . 
  as a side note , six out of ten fled occupied poland through romania . 
  [ poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-romanian_alliance ) ( and [ others ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia#other_responses ) ) might remember a [ long forgotten solidarity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_entente ) in eastern europe . 
   the ironic thing is that if putin had simply waited , he could have had crimea ** in a civilized way ** , by a proper , recognized referendum . 
  i doubt he wants that . 
  his whole political life at the top was based on the image of a strongman , and that 's what he is trying to breathe new life into . 
  the russian govt story is pure mythology : the old nemesis ( fascists ) with help from the eternal enemy ( the west ) is trying to grab the original motherland ( ukraine ) . 
  a hero is needed to save the chosen people . 
   a fair referendum would never pass that 's why it 's in a week , while spirits are still high and people still disoriented - and international monitoring not organized . 
  interestingly , if ukrainians went too fast with the minority languages law and lost crimea , putin might be going too fast with crimea and lose eastern ukraine . 
  vodka . 
  there 's also a political crisis going on , with the govt coalition - opposed to the president - breaking up . 
  even / r/romania 's troll is demoralized . 
   churkin held up a copy of the letter for council members to see . 
  the other letter , in which yanukovich asked the duma to pass a law enabling russia to annex crimea , was eaten by [ a dog ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6w6qkxg.png ) . 
  there are [ five routes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_logistics_in_the_afghan_war ) , only one through russia itself , two through former ssrs and two through pakistan . 
  so a ` breakdown in relations ' with russia would be a problem , but would n't ` effectively cut these forces off ' . 
  great read . 
  among other things :  i think the main goal here is to make ukrainians hateful to russians , so that the maidan is not perceived by russians as their own experience . 
  so that it is seen as the experience of an enemy that needs to be rejected . 
  out of curiosity , what greek companies were involved ? 
  i suppose intrakom , but would n't know about others ?

  oopsie indeed  thanks . 
   the government will only have minority support in the parliament apparently not , as they seem to have enlisted the help of udmr ( the hungarian minority party ) . 
  apparently they can even claim antonescu 's ( ~ ~ pdl ~ ~ pnl ) position as head of the senate . 
  certainly more civilized than installing the monument in the first place .

  but then you did n't grow up with it as a constant reminder of your helplessness . 
  dinosaurs belong in museums . 
  the soviets had no sense of ~ ~ humour ~ ~ reality . 
  this is not really about lenin-the-person , but more about his image being used as a symbol of oppression . 
  if the soviets were fair they 'd have erected big statues of soldier 's boots in bronze , and we would n't have such debates today . 
  the usual bottle is 0,7 l. 
  but at the time , the cheapest wine in shops came in 1l bottles , and it was the low-brow way of referring to it - a kilo of wine ( * un chil de vin * ) . 
  it 's a disparaging expression . 
   we have statues of cromwell outside parliament ... erected three centuries after the man 's death . 
  and cromwell was a national figure , not a representative of an occupying force . 
  that lady has some excellent ideas , and i 'd definitely like to see lenin , the soviet soldier , petru groza etc. 
  in some sort of circle of history in one of the parks . 
  and the headless lady with the ball on lenin 's former pedestal is the best thing i saw in that place . 
  thanks for sharing the links . 
  bucharest , i suppose ? 
  i was there too , boy was it good to see that thing go !, 
  did you know we still have it ? 
  it 's [ at mogo\u0219oaia ] ( http://epochtimes-romania.com/news_images/2012/11/2012_11_16_11_rsz.jpg ) , together with petru groza ( demolished the day after lenin by a truck driver that was bribed with a kilo of wine by a couple of citizens ) . 
  heh , missed the link . 
  18 % is still a significant proportion . 
  anyway , scratch the demographics part . 
  as i understand it , some 30 % of the autonomous republic are non-g\u0103g\u0103uz - ukrainians , romainians ... which form a majority in moldova . 
  you make a new country on an ethnic basis from another where 30 % of your population represent a majority . 
  i 'd say it 's difficult .
