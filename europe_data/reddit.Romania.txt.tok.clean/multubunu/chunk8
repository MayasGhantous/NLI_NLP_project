  russia is hundreds of kilometers away of transnistria as well , but they have kept an interest in all former bits of their 19th century empire . 
  in this case , both transnistria and the minuscule g\u0103g\u0103uzia are part of a barely concealed blackmail against moldova . 
   look how great liechtenstein does with 35,000 people . 
  how many carpets do they export ? 
   very low business taxes ( lowest in europe after andorra 's 10 % maximum tax rate ) -- the corporate tax rate is a flat 12.5 % [ 28 ] -- as well as easy rules of incorporation have induced about 73,700 holding ( or so-called ` letter box ' ) companies to establish registered offices in liechtenstein . 
  this provides about 30 % of liechtenstein 's state revenue . 
  not to mention that these ( as well as the other european micronations ) have a long history of self-government . 
  by contrast , g\u0103g\u0103uzia is a rural area in the swamps north of the danube delta , with complicated geography and difficult demographics . 
  it 's not like scotland ( oil ! ), 
  left the uk ; more like the islands of mull , wight and anglesey forming their own nation and seceding . 
  and it would probably still be easier for them . 
  there are some differences though . 
  g\u0103g\u0103uzia consists of [ four separate enclaves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gagauzia_map.jpg ) , with a grand total of three cities , and a population of 160k of which about 2/3 are g\u0103g\u0103uzi . 
  economy ? 
  [ * there are twelve wineries , processing over 400,000 tonnes annually . 
  there are also two oil factories , two carpet factories , one meat factory , and one non-alcoholic beverages factory . * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauzia#economy ) . 
  i wonder if independence will do them any good . 
   ** there is no place for politics in olympics and it should stay this way !, 
  ** your temple should be a house of sports , but they have made it a den of protesters , eh ? 
  olympics is somewhat a sports events , mostly an orgy of advertising . 
  why stop the athletes to express themselves for a change ? 
  just in case you did n't see [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lnuxqu9j9da ) ... 
  death penalty was abolished shortly after , but was a legal option up until then . 
  interesting , if so , it 's indeed a very popular urban legend . 
  never had cevapcici , but seen as they are served `` often with chopped onions , sour cream , kajmak , ajvar , cottage cheese , minced red pepper and salt '' , they ca n't be that close . 
  i ca n't imagine having mici with anything else but mustard , 
  that was the point of my post . 
  the article is uninformed . 
  if you 're going to be byzantine about aesthetics and stuff , at least know your shit . 
  oh , and it 's not pronounced meech , but more like * mitch * .

   romanian sausage not a sausage , there-s no skin around it . 
  more like a - spicy - meatball , but grilled not fried . 
   romania 's national dish it 's not a `` dish '' , it 's a. . . snack ? 
  you ca n't have * mititei * as a meal , it 's something that goes with beer . 
   mici , ( pronounced meech ) originated in turkey during the days of the ottoman empire not at all . 
  if the spices are fairly reminiscent of some types of kebab , the actual `` dish '' as it is known today originated in bucharest in the early 20th century as a modified * patrician * , a much larger piece of actual sausage . 
  * mici * or * mititei * means * small ones * and apparently they became a lot more popular precisely because of the reduced size . 
  oh , and there 's pork in it ( mixed with beef and sometimes lamb ) . 
   the eu had been concerned the additive was being used to disguise bad meat . 
  which is utterly stupid . 
  the spices in that thing can hide poor meat quality much better than any additive . 
  the bicarbonate has something to do with the looks of the uncooked composition ( as i have read ) . 
  i ca n't speak for croatia , but over here there 's lots of pubs/restaurants that do have wifi , and if it 's password protected , they will provide the password to paying customers - because you can always go to another restaurant . 
  it 's much harder to change hotels , so they 're not as likely to give away wifi service . . 
  excellent article . 
  tl ; dr :  is this growth sustenable ? 
   the immediate answer seems to be no , seen the high proportion agriculture has . 
   however , the answer might be yes if - the previously stagnating - consumption picks up . 
  unfortunately :  strong agricultural output agricultural output is fairly unreliable , and the industry is not in a very good shape ( except perhaps for the foreign-owned dacia ) . 
  so this is not really promising for the future , just pretty good for now .

  politics :  democracy can exist within despotism , as long as the despot is enlightened . 
   there is no need for pluri-partitism , democracy is ensured by different currents within the same single party ( 1990 , as president )  ni\u0219te golani ( hooligans ) specifically , april 24th 1990 , about people in pia\u021ba universit\u0103\u021bii , but also 1968 about protests in bucharest ( while being secretary of youth ) and 2013 about ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 protests , again in pia\u021ba universit\u0103\u021bii .

  in following years the miner 's leader miron cozma was eventually sentenced to jail . 
  in the last days of his mandate in 2004 , president iliescu pardoned cozma but had to revoke this decision due to public outcry .

  there is also the matter of austria and russia competing for influence in the areas the ailing ottoman empire was slowly bleeding away , with the hopeful but small balkan nations ( bulgaria , greece , romania , serbia ) peeping over their shoulders , and austrian ally germany caught between france/britain and russia .

   they should give these houses to all the roma gypsies heading to the uk .

  the state of the empire is much worse than you imagine . 
  not only has the uk gov ' t lost any capacity to dispose of irish private property , but ireland has become a separate independent state altogether .
