  this applies to all the populations called * vlach * as well ( throughout the balkans ) . 
  it 's the germanic exonym , while the endonym is often based on * roman * . 
  ( edit ) * german * and * allemand * are exonyms as well , they call themselves something based on * deutsch * . 
  ... making it even more confusing [ to some ] ( http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/400-athletic-bilbao-fans-travelled-hungary-see-europa-180349205.html ) , 
  [ o.o ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antitheist ), 
  tried that . 
  did n't work . 
   in wales we are still waiting for the return of the romans . 
  well , apparently come january 1st , you will get plenty of poor man 's romans . 
  ( as a sidenote , wales and walach are cognates , both descended from a germanic word depicting those within the roman empire ) . 
  i can definitely see your point , but there is no [ such word ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dclpfkw.png ) in webster ( and neither in any romanian dictionary ) . 
  it is certainly needed , and so is * apatheist * , 
  it 's not like there were special classes . 
  but there 's constant mention that religion is ` opium of the peoples ' and ` false belief ' and such , in classes like history , literature etc. 
  then there were the ` political ' classes , there was something called scientific socialism , for instance , where you get a pounding of ` the past was wrong ' with special mention of religion . 
  i can see that , but the question was about education . 
  i think there is a difference between not touching religion at all , and an actual atheistic education , which difference may be interesting in a survey . 
  i had both ; my parents never showed any inclination in any direction , but at school atheism was actively taught . 
  ( edit ) to clarify , that was in the '70s - '80s . 
  there are currently religion classes in romanian public schools , where to my understanding orthodox christianity is taught exclusively . 
  one can opt out , but apparently it 's not easy . 
  hungary . 
  not sure what that would solve , but it should be fun . 
  some thouhgts 1 . 
  some people are indifferent to religion , others are actively opposed . 
  atheist and ` no religious upbringing ' are different things , perhaps they deserved separate entries . 
  ' i think homosexual behaviour is moral ' - would n't it be better said ` not immoral ' ? 
  ( which goes for heterosexual behavior as well ) . 
  ` my view on romani/gypsy people is generally ... negative/positive ' - this seems a bit misleading . 
  i see them as victims , which is hardly ` positive ' . 
  ` how do you feel about scotland 's independence ? ', 
  - why just scotland ? 
  could this be rephrased in a more general manner , say ` how do you feel about the right to independence of territories currently within some european states ? ', 
  ( i 'm sure someone can phrase this better ) . 
  ` current immigration policies need to be rethought . 
  agree/disagree ' - a bit vague ? 
  in my country or generally in europe ? 
  also , do i agree with change because i find them too restrictive or too lax ? 
  ` which european country has the silliest accent ? ', 
  - my accent in french is rather silly , but italians speaking romanian sound * really * funny . 
  did you mean ` silliest accent in english ' ? 
  you got romania wrong . 
  all the area that says * beer * should be * vodka * ( well , * \u021buic\u0103 / p\u0103linc\u0103 * ) . 
  beer is not a drink , but a mere refreshment . 
  also , the presents are given on st basil 's day ( january 1st ) not on christmas eve . 
  at least in romania - and presumably in greece - saint nicholas is a separate feast on december 6th , also involving presents . 
  thanks , subscribed !, 
  a debate between / u/countvontroll and / u/krattr will beat any tv show any time . 
  as the flair shows , english is not my primary language . 
  sorry for the misunderstanding . 
  an attack ? 
  a man buys the newspaper every morning , glances at the first page , then throws it away . 
  one day the newspaper man asks him why . 
  \\ - i 'm just interested in the obituaries , says the guy . 
  \\ - but these are on page 5 !, 
  \\ - yeah , the one i 'm expecting will be on the first page . 
  ------- jesus christ fed 5000 with five loaves and two fish . 
  the communist regime will not be guilty of such waste . 
  ------ \\ - communism is the golden future of mankind . 
  for instance , there will be no food shortages whatsoever . 
  all members of the working class will be able to go to the market and get all the beans they require , for them and their family . 
  \\ - but what if i do n't like beans ? 
  \\ - oh , you * will * !, 
   is the joke that you should expect romanian workmanship to be shoddy ? 
  yes , but more than that . 
  * we * know that it 's shoddy ; * normal people * do n't expect it - like pista , and that 's the joke , he 's hungarian . 
  meaning hungarians are ` normal ' , and we are not . 
  the fact that this joke needs explaining makes it ` highbrow ' in my book . 
   is pista like bula ? 
  no , bul\u0103 is essentially the smart , quick , romanian guy that constantly outwits his opponents . 
  ( joke from the seventies ) : i\u021bic ( yitzak ) and strull find a way to print the 200 lei banknote ( not existing at the time ) , so they try to put it on the market . 
  strull goes on to buy some pretzels ( covrigi , costing 1 leu ) with the forged currency , and finds bul\u0103 . 
  he returns happy with the result , and presents i\u021bic with the change : two bills of 75 and a coin of 49 . 
   you 're my friend thanks !, 
  but i do n't deserve it . 
  on the other hand , * you * are the guy who told his family/friends to boycott chevron , so * you * are * my * friend , as you went the length to actually do something for the likes of us . 
  the first one is simply a hit at at the wooden tongue , with the added hint at the fact that whatever looks modern will look obsolete at some point in the future . 
  the second one is absurd , but firstly it shows the romanians as idle and the hungarian as hard working ; most importantly , pista trusts the infrastructure , while ion and gheo ' * know * that whatever is built by the [ romanian ] state is meant to crumble and essentially dangerous . 
  yeah , i 'm not good at explaining jokes ... 
  what , exactly ? 
  the vast majority of what i 've heard over the years are self deprecating . 
  feel free to contradict with examples , 
   yeah , most of the jokes are based on antimagyarism actually , most of them are self deprecating , even the ones you posted . 
  bul\u0103 , fighting along spartacus , is captured by the romans and sentenced to crucifixion . 
  after being set on the cross , and as the troops were leaving , he shouts : \\ - long live early feudalism , the golden future of mankind !, 
  -- ion rides his motorbike to the cri\u0219 , where to his surprise , a bridge has been erected . 
  - * no * ^ ( * well * , in ardelene\u0219te ) , they built a bridge over the cri\u0219 ! , he mutters in disbelief , then rides his bike through the nearby ford , then lays down in the sun to dry up and lights a fag . 
  five minutes later , gheo ' arrives on his bike , wonders about the bridge , then goes through the ford , lays down next to ion and lights a fag . 
  another five minutes and pista comes along , driving a cart full of firewood . 
  \\ - * no * , they built a bridge over the cri\u0219 !, 
  and he whips the horses and goes over the bridge . 
  the bridge crumbles , and pista , cart , horses , and firewood are taken away by the whirling waters of the cri\u0219 . 
  ion : * no * ... saw ` t ? 
  gheo ' : seen . 
  ion : * no * ... 
  this pista fellow ... did n't he * see * they built a bridge over the cri\u0219 ?? 
  ----- there 's the one in my other comment above . 
  really , there 's a lot of highbrow jokes . 
  i 'd say we do prefer absurdist humour though . 
  the romans are besieging sarmizegetusa , the dacian capitol city .
