  because good vine and hot chicks ? 
  well , it looks like also germany is kinda awful at it . 
  just saying . 
  edit : our roma at least speak languages . 
  in my opinion all the integration talk is just bs , mostly because it does n't work . 
  i 'm ok whit giving them a small impulse to get started in the world but in the long run just let them do their own thing . 
  the thing is that people adapt and in ordered to survive most of them will start learning languages and start taking jobs , of course as in every culture and nation there are bad guys and good guys . 
  whit the roma , europe failed because we started treating them different than the rest of the community ( especially in ee ) whit out having a reason . 
  for the freshly arrived immigrants i still think there is a chance . 
  please explain . 
  depends on the roma and on the story . 
  i have friends who went to school , got a diploma and later a master and now are working in high profile companies and they did it on their own , whit out all the fancy `` integrating the minority '' bull shit . 
  dude , you should really leave that bunker .

  hungary actually was one of the biggest eu money absorbed last year ( do n't have the data handy , i 'm on the phone ) , same with poland . 
  i was thinking about this , most our extremists started sliding after trump got elected . 
  looks like europe is waking up . 
  same as masturbation , think about it . 
  is that story still going on ? 
  5 years ago when i was studying in italy people were already talking about it .
