[ king kong ai n't got shit on vlad tepes ] ( http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2014/06/dracula-untold-domestic-poster-crop-850x560.jpg ), 
  glorious vlad tepes the impaler !, 
  ( dracula ) what 's that ? 
  romania no receive money ? 
  i hope you 've got garlic or some stakes around ... 
  i 'll take 3 please . 
  tchaikovsky , my personal favorite composer . 
  thessaloniki is my favorite town in the whole world . 
  i love greece , its people , its culture , its food . 
  because , you see , you can easily nuke terrorists ... 
  if those nukes start flying it wo n't matter where you are or who you are . 
  just hope you like brahmin meat and glowing in the dark . 
  oh come on , hawaii was fair game . 
  [ maybe they pissed off the wrong guy ? 
  [ i bet they had a great time ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/north-korea-crystal-meth-drugs-diplomats-nathan-thompson ) ... 
  do n't forget tchaikovsky . 
  this is so true , we suck at organizing anything . 
  my god man , what have you been smoking ? 
  as far as i understood , it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  even if the reformists take power , the deal is done , ukraine is n't joining eu anytime soon . 
  * i very much hope i 'm wrong *, 
  well , no , moldavia is in another league . 
  because even if the people want to be pro-european , russia will make it very difficult for anyone to leave its sphere of influence . 
  upvote for you my friend . 
  oh wait ... back to relevant questions , is this for mobile and/or desktop ? 
   i hope the turks take all of your fucking island ( i might even go there to help them ) . 
  once , you have being under turkish control for 300 years , maybe you develop a little bit of empathy . 
  what is this i do n't even ... 
  no wrecks , they 're sold by gypsies right after they crash . 
  but plenty of skid marks . 
  come to romania , my fellow eu friends . 
  we have so many nice roads with all kinds of nice surprises . 
  too much u-bahn for you ? 
  well , we 've got 400 km of it . 
  some lack the road foundation , some lack the required number of pot holes ( 1000/km ) . 
  tired of illuminated roads ? 
  say no more , when you 're driving on a dirt road at night you do n't even see your lights . 
  it 's so nice . 
  too few real obstacles ? 
  well , we hope you like unlit carriages going the wrong way on your lane . 
  what 's that ? 
  you think you just saw some drunk guy in the middle of the road at night shouting profanities at your car ? 
  must be the wind . 
  do n't you like to drink and drive ? 
  we do . 
  a lot !, 
  must be tiresome with all those german road safety regulations . 
  [ in romania we do n't like safety ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:fig_3_number_of_road_traffic_accident_fatalities_per_million_inhabitants,_2012.png ) . 
  life 's nice like that . 
  romania is so nice to its fellow car drivers , some pedestrians really really want to get closer to their cars . 
  red light be damned . 
  romania !, 
  where the roads are so friendly , they want to keep you forever . 
   porcine necrophiliac bestiality in front of an audience . 
  that 's so metal, 
  well , when the queen calls you to say `` you 'd better do the right thing '' ... some pig is getting fucked . 
  yeah , like fucking up the economy and starving the population so he can pay the country 's foreign debt because no one gets to tell ceausescu what and when to pay , those fucking foreigners trying to steal our monies . 
  good times . 
  must they really ? 
  is your head only for decor ? 
  i have a friend that finished the veterinary university . 
  he did some practice at the local zoo where some brown bears reside . 
  what was the brown bear 's favorite meal ? 
  hands . 
  mititei may be good but they 're nothing compared to guly\u00e1s . 
  holy shit , that 's a lot !, 
  monetary issues and no real european integration would be my guess . 
  regarding immigrants we could accommodate them if we 'd really want because most of them just want to make a better life for themselves but they suck so we do n't want to keep them so back they go . 
  and stuf like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax6kd0ksrym ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cke1ij84pnc ) does n't help . 
  black death was fine , just an itch . 
  [ yeah , definitely , immigrants ] ( http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/uploads/2015/07/01/478073250-greeces-prime-minister-alexis-tsipras-laughs-as-he.jpg.crop.promovar-mediumlarge.jpg ) . 
  i 'm just joking , i know that your country most of all is overcrowded with immigrants , i know it 's a problem , i hope the ( wo ) men in charge will find a solution . 
   immigration is the biggest problem europe has ever faced [ top ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/yuanemperoralbumgenghisportrait.jpg ) [ kek ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/886/955/8a3.gif ), 
  monies is nice and shiny and pretty , we like monies !, 
  [ they should search for it ... on the moon ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/451138695274717184/i2nncpcc.jpeg ), 
  posting with your alt account so your racism can be seen in all its glory . 
  [ jedward romanian version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd55n0e1his ), 
  this is all sorts of fucking awesome . 
  check their youtube views , they are having some success . 
  also manele ( the music genre ) is a relatively new music genre , you can have a bit of success with minimal requirements , sometimes even [ no talent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3zjlmutzp8 ) , but most of the time that will be fleeting . 
  no brain no pain , just dancing . 
  [ goddamn right !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncqpzhpyruc ), 
  [ here 's some more romanian music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ptfqmmzuu ), 
  this is fucking awesome . 
  \u266b you are the cheeky boys , you are the cheeky boys !, 
  no , we invented [ mamaliga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riclidm9nug ) . 
  we do not speak of ~ ~ o-zone ~ ~ those that must not be named ... 
  [ i am sorry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0do0xys8ko ) [ i am sorry again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_xyswvz-8 ) [ like , really sorry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mk60knrdci ), 
  and romania . 
  it 's so popular i just had 3 . 
  give us back our vampires !, 
  we have elections in a few months , they 're needed . 
  give back my wallet , gypsy, 
  because too much iliescu , not enough basescu . 
  we are wallet vampires , we drink your monies . 
  depends on why you 're asking, 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  neah , we 're semi proud of being called vampires , vlad tepes is seen as an ok voievod . 
  for romania you could also use `` i was told this is gypsy country .
