the butcher shops are n't dirty !, 
  i know , i was exagerating to illustrate how some people think ( the supermarket for everything type ) . 
   i need to learn romanian words for specific cuts of meat and things like `` marbling '' to really get my money 's worth from those places though . 
  unfortunately , romanian beef sucks ( or good cuts do n't make it to most shops ) . 
  try `` antricot cu floare '' ( ribeye ) , `` vr\u0103bioar\u0103 ' ( striploin ) or `` mu\u0219chi '' ( tenderloin ) . 
  there 's no word for marbling in romanian , the notion is unknown . 
  also , aged beef is very hard to find . 
  but you can find offal , if you 're into that . 
  they 're dirt cheap and make a perfect grill . 
  she has a sister . 
  it 's real . 
  it explains the stinking buses , trains and offices . 
  everyone is sweating profusely but they get violent if you try to open a window . 
   despite romania being known as an agricultural country , it 's rare to find non-imported food in romanian supermarkets . 
  this tends to piss off romanians . 
  well , corporate types use supermarket chains for food , because food markets and butcher shops are , you know , stinky and dirty . 
  plus , they do n't sell microwave dinners . 
  and supermarkets are everywhere . 
  you can get perfectly fresh food if you have the patience to venture in a traditional market . 
  there are still plenty around , but sellers ( middlemen more than farmers ) wo n't have cash registers and will try to sucker you . 
  totally worth it , though . 
  no , they 're building the great orthodox mall of romania . 
  they will literally ( as in actually ) sell billions of tax free candles there . 
  not to mention the paid commemorations , because dead people need shout-outs , do n't they ? 
   we do n't have enough of that in romania . 
  the meaning of words is lost on you . 
  enough is very subjective . 
   joke of a democracy again : it 's all very subjective . 
  i find britain closer to a police state than romania . 
  catalonia , scotland or ireland are probably better candidates for separation than romanian regions . 
   think of it as divorce of a really dysfunctional family . 
  there 's a reason that happens and there 's a reason it 's good . 
  except it 's not a divorce , but rather abandonment of the children . 
  also , besides you , not very many people think it 's a good idea . 
  where do you live ? 
  i bet bra\u0219ov or cluj . 
  loosen up , nobody is robbing your region . 
   what can you point to to suggest that there 's any semblance of a functioning society ? 
  society is imperfect . 
  society has no goals set in stone , but rather a collection of objectives that we revise periodically to adjust for mistakes and new directions . 
  the only things that hold a society together is the general feeling that we 'll fare better together rather than alone , and the stake we have in the common pool of things created by that society . 
  that short for * the intention of taking part in a society * . 
  that 's all it takes . 
  societies are more or less functional , but that 's debatable . 
  the things you can point to are so very common . 
  many societies share them . 
  having them in our society does n't mean we should dissolve it , furthermore , splitting the country apart in smaller regions wo n't help a bit . 
   i 'm not even talking about federalization or regionalization . 
  i 'm referring to actually splitting up the country into independent regions . 
  what 's the difference ? 
   it simply does n't work as it is now , we romanians share nothing but the language , we have no common interests in being a society . 
  that 's edgy , and not true . 
  we lack some traits of being a society , but intention is not one of them . 
  functionality and efficiency depend on complexity and general design . 
  we ca n't properly manage simple things right now , like transportation , health care and funds absortion . 
  what makes you think we can manage more complex systems ? 
  i do n't think federalization works for countries like romania . 
   i 'm sure we can figure something out . 
  do we ? 
   we need working state and bureaucracy ( and democracy ) , not the the illusion of it . 
  that 's just some words in a sentence . 
   i honestly dislike the idea of romania . 
  that 's edgy . 
   my hope is that one day it will break apart into smaller and more functional pieces . 
  that would lead to inequal development patterns : currently , some areas contribute to the central budget , while others benefit from it . 
  federalization , to some extent , will lead to the ghettoisation of some areas ( think harcov , vaslui , teleroman and so on ) . 
  plus , we need less state and bureaucracy , not more . 
  previously tagged as edgy , now confirmed . 
  it 's a bullshit issue nationalists use to rally fans against a common enemy . 
  it 's idiotic , but they have their public . 
  it 's like saying ashkenazi jews have german sounding names ( and yiddish is basically german ) , therefore germany should do something about it so they do n't get associated with the bad pr jews sometimes get . 
  [ of course ] ( http://www.islamicfinder.org/prayerdetail.php?country=finland&amp;city=helsinki&amp;state=13&amp;id=8256&amp;month=&amp;year=&amp;email=&amp;home=2015-8-4&amp;lang=english&amp;aversion=&amp;athan= ) . 
  yes , that color transition is the single most horrendous thing i 've seen in istanbul , and i stayed in tarlaba\u015f\u0131 once . 
  as i fractured my ankle in december , i 'm literally doing this . 
  not that they would care . 
  not again , please . 
  bucharest also has a shit-ton of bauhaus buildings . 
  look at that beautiful entrance to the metro station !, 
  [ paris of the east ... ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/paris_of_the_east ), 
   those soviet blocks are even worse , but they where ment to stand for 40 years and then be demolished and replaced by proper buildings . 
  they 're quite [ resilient ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=blocuri+bucuresti&amp;cad=h ) , you 'll find . 
  we still have plenty around . 
   then again , seeing how greedy corporations are these days , i would n't be surprised to see the project given a green light . 
  ca n't be . 
  not with the recent events . 
  whoever tries that is so out of politics . 
  oh , fuck of with that propaganda . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  there 's a name for that : [ poe 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ) . 
  on the other hand : nobody 's that idiot to go back so far in history to argument today 's issues . 
  i hope . 
   also , this happened 1000 years ago so it 's very likely that you and me as well as a majority of europeans are related to them . 
  ca n't be . 
  i 'm all dacians and romans . 
  but i 'm white ... 
  hahahaha . 
  the actual point being : you do n't have any sense of humor . 
  hungarians were initially migrants , for fuck 's sake . 
  edit : it 's actually a joke . 
  after all , i have nothing against migration , be it midldle eastern , north african or hun .
