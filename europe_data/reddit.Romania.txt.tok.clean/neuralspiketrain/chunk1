here is the abstract of [ the actual report ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/files/fiscalej.pdf ) ( thanks to [ / u/intermediatetransit in / r/worldnews ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2lcqxd/immigration_from_outside_europe_cost_120_billion/cltkj23 ) ) , presenting a much more nuanced overall view :  our findings indicate that , when considering the resident immigrant population in each year from 1995 to 2011 , immigrants from the european economic area ( eea ) have made a positive fiscal contribution , even during periods when the uk was running budget deficits , while non-eea immigrants , not dissimilar to natives , have made a negative contribution . 
  ** for immigrants that arrived since 2000 , contributions have been positive throughout , and particularly so for immigrants from eea countries . 
  ** notable is the strong positive contribution made by immigrants from countries that joined the eu in 2004 .

  you have a point there . 
  so , for comparison , here 's the gdp growth ( annual % ) for the best performers on this map : | 2012 | 2013 -- | -- | -- cyprus | -2.4 | -5.4 romania | +0.4 | +3.5 spain | -1.6 | -1.2 slovenia | -2.5 | -1.1 bulgaria | +0.6 | +0.9 greece | -7.0 | -3.9 and for the worst performers : | 2012 | 2013 -- | -- | -- denmark | -0.4 | +0.4 estonia | +3.9 | +0.8 portugal | -3.2 | -1.4 germany | +0.7 | +0.4 france | +0.0 | +0.2 poland | +1.9 | +1.6 source : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?display=default, 
   how much multiculturalism has been lost countrywide in the last 80 years i do n't dispute that . 
  on the contrary , i find it sad : multiculturalim was good for tranyslvania . 
  i 'm just saying that it was an evolution determined by larger and more complex historical factors than an supposed forced assimilation . 
  you seem to forget the timespan . 
  this is 80 years we are talking about , almost three generations . 
  instead of using such emotional weasel-words as `` not all out genocide '' , would n't we be better off analyzing the cold numbers ? 
  here are , face to face , the natural population growth rates in [ romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_romania#between_ww_i_and_ww_ii ) and [ hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_hungary#births_and_deaths ) , respectively . 
  it 's easy to see that , for most of the 20th century , romanians have had a slightly larger natural population growth than hungarians . 
  could n't be just possible that this is the main cause of the evolution of the ratio between the two in transylvania ? 
   19.3 % nationwide in 1930 could you quote a source for that ? 
  according to this [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_romania#ethnic_groups ) , in 1930 the hungarian population was 7.9 % . 
  from the article you linked :  according to census data , the hungarian population of transylvania decreased from 25.5 % in 1920 to 19.6 % in 2002 . 
  so , overall , a decrease of 6 % in 80 years , or 0.075 % a year . 
  does n't seem very effective to me . 
   the ethnic distribution of transylvania has been significantly changed in the past 60 years precisely through such policies . 
  that 's a very charged way of describing the events . 
  mostly , the process consisted of a demographic homogenization between the mostly hungarian cities and their mostly romanian hinterland . 
  the main cause was intense industrialization , which brought about a large urban inflow in a short period of time . 
  it 's worth mentioning that , previously , the orthodox romanians had been kept out of the cities through artificial means : at first as an official policy , from 1438 \\ ( [ unio trium nationum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum ) \\ ) to 1781-82 \\ ( the [ patent of toleration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patent_of_toleration ) , and the [ edict of tolerance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1782_edict_of_tolerance ) \\ ) , and then through more subtle discrimination . 
  actually , there is a well-documented gothic historical presence in the pontic steppe , and [ even in crimea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_goths ) . 
  in my own country , one of the most famous historical artifacts is the [ pietroasele treasure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietroasele_treasure ) , a 19 kilo , 4th century gothic gold hoard . 
  whenever talk comes around to *** the sub *** , i feel like i 'm 12 and reading harry potter again .

   what exactly could russia still do in moldova ? 
  what about [ gagauzia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauzia#independent_moldova ) ? 
  it seems ideal for [ a little mischief-making ] ( http://www.moldova.org/counter-intelligence-services-found-russian-recruiters-in-southern-moldova/ ) . 
  in medieval moldavia , the milky way was known as the serfs ' way ( drumul robilor ) , as it was used for orientation by christian slaves escaping to moldavia from the golden horde . 
  i do n't think you need conspiracy theories to explain this : they had n't any legal tricks left , and all the ways to protract had been already used . 
  it simply was n't anywhere else to proceed than to sentencing . 
  in this time , 71 hearings took place , 7 different judicial panels deliberated on it , and voiculescu quit his parliament seat twice to force a change of jurisdiction . 
  ac/dc 's [ you shook me all night long ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo2qqmj0_h4 ), 
   the parliament 's triumph will ** damage ** the commission 's authority by making it more ** subservient ** to the eu legislature . 
   ** even on a good day ** , the ** salty smell ** of politics ** wafts ** through the commission 's corridors . 
  so strange to see the central pillar of the parliamentary system -- the precedence of the elected legislative branch over the appointed executive branch -- described in such a way , and by none other than london 's ft. 
  in 1773 , on one of his visits to transylvania , the emperor joseph ii made a detour through the borderguards district of n\u0103s\u0103ud / nussdorf . 
  according to tradition , he saluted the mostly romanian inhabitants of the area with `` salve parvae nepos romuli ! '', 
  ( latin for `` greetings , grandnephews of [ romulus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romulus_and_remus ) ! '' ) . 
  they were so impressed that they promptly renamed four villages with his four words . 
  the villages remain so named to this day . 
   but then stalin led russia / soviet union to victory in wwii i 'm sorry , but while it may be factually correct that stalin was the wartime leader of the ussr , the russians won the war on the eastern front more * in spite * than * because * of him . 
  the russians were surprised by the german attack because of stalin 's obstinacy , had a abysmal morale and were practically without a military leadership because of stalin 's purges . 
  the moment when they turned the tide was when stalin finally accepted to stop micromanaging the war , halt -- temporarily at least -- the political commissars , and let the generals ( zhukov , konev , timoshenko , and others ) do their job . 
  there was a city named after the generalissimo in every country in the former eastern bloc . 
  according to the [ montreux convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_turkish_straits ) , turkey does indeed have control over warships entering the straits , but it has to guarantee passage of civilian vessels in peacetime . 
  that 's pretty grim reading . 
  although analogies between south ossetia and crimea can only go so far . 
  s. ossetia is a rural , mountainous , land-locked semi-exclave whose only contact to the outside world is through that tunnel ( the border with georgia being , i assume , closed ) . 
  crimea is an urbanized peninsula with a long coastline and modern ports . 
  that `` territories annexed to ukraine '' map is a masterpiece of propaganda and it contains so many historical fallacies i do n't even know where to begin itemizing them . 
  but maybe the biggest of them is suggesting that , somehow , along the last 350 years , russia kept breaking up pieces of its own ancestral territory and generously giving them to ukraine . 
  it 's sudetenland all over again . 
  [ lapte de pas\u0103re ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ujuvad_saarekesed.jpg ) ( aka floating island ), 
   so , he 's disliked because he turned his back on the nazis ? 
  that 's a twist . 
  or was it because he gave up before getting moldova back ? 
  king michael 's coup is a pretty divisive and politically-charged subject in romania . 
  germany is seen in this situation not so much as `` the nazis '' , but as the only ally who stood by romania 's side against the soviet occupation of [ bessarabia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) ( aka moldova ) . 
  of course this is false , because the 1940 soviet ultimatum came as a direct consequence of the 1939 [ soviet-nazi pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ribbentrop-molotov.svg ) ( but these protocols were secret at the time ) . 
  what is true though is that none of the traditional western allies of romania did or say anything before or after the war to support us , and , ultimately , did nothing to obstruct the imposition of a brutal dictatorship by the soviets . 
  also , the germans are seen as a wartime comrade-in-arms , and it 's seen as dishonorable to abandon them in a difficult situation . 
  the classic view , and the one which many -- including me -- embrace , is that king michael did what was possible in a very tight spot , when his options were very limited , and acted in the best interest of the country . 
  the revisionist view , though , is different . 
  beside viewing the capitulation as unnecessary ( romania should have obtained better terms , or maybe kept fighting etc. 
  ) , they see king michael as an enabler of the soviet post-war occupation . 
  theirs is not necessarily a very logical position , but when did that stop anyone in politics ? 
   what did carol ii and michael i do , exactly ? 
  the main accusation against carol ii is of abusing his powers as a constitutional monarch : initially through manipulation of the political parties ( 1930-1938 ) , then openly overthrowing the democratic system and instituting a personal dictatorship ( 1938-1940 ) . 
  his hands-on approach eventually turned against him : he was blamed for failing to act in any way during the year 1940 while romania lost about 1/3 of its territory to claims by its neigbours . 
  on a personal level he 's seen as a reckless playboy : he eloped with a commoner in the last months of wwi , then , in 1925 , abandoned his second wife , princess helen , for another liaison with a jewish ( the horror ! ), 
  adventuress . 
  michael i , the child of carol ii and princess helen , ruled as a simple figurehead from 1940 to 1944 , during romania 's involvement in wwii as an ally of nazi germany . 
  in august 1944 , as the red army was penetrating the front in ne romania , michael i staged a palace coup against wartime leader , general ion antonescu , issued a ceasefire , and announced the acceptance of an allied armistice , on extremely harsh terms imposed by the soviets . 
  his action in 1944 is seen by some as a unnecessary capitulation in front of the soviets , and as a betrayal of the german ally . 
  for the rest of his reign ( 1945-1947 ) , michael was again just a figurehead , this time for the pro-soviet government of romania . 
  he was forced by the communists to abdicate at the end of 1947 . 
  [ here it is ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1u9aa5/the_change_of_gdp_per_capita_in_europe_in_the/cefqqpn ) , as explained by / u/tuesias , the op in / r/mapporn :  lithuanian gdp , for example , per capita in 2001 was 42 % of the eu average while in 2012 it was 72 % - the relative change is +30 ; german gdp per capita in 2001 was 116 % of eu average while in 2012 it was 123 % of average - relative change is +7, 
  if it does , it is entirely my fault . 
  i have probably got ahead of myself trying to find a better phrase structure , while keeping the meaning intact . 
  you are probably correct . 
  sorry about that . 
  non-native english speaker here . 
  also : norway , iceland , switzerland , and turkey are not eu countries , of course . 
  my bad . 
  [ it seems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_faroe_islands ) there are some icelandic , norwegian and polish expats ( totalling 0.8 % of the 49,709 inhabitants ) . 
  funny tidbit : according to same wiki article , the y chromosomes of the faroese , tracing male descent , are 87 % scandinavian , while mitochondrial dna , tracing female descent , is 84 % scottish/irish . 
  oil , ballerinas , and billionaires . 
  what about [ the four blindfolded moors ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/bandera_nacionalista_sarda.svg/800px-bandera_nacionalista_sarda.svg.png ) of sardinia ? 
  the other motto , * honi soit qui mal y pense * , is so much better fitting imho , as it perfectly catches the british `` stiff upper lip '' . 
  maybe because communism is a utopia ? 
  for my country , at least , more important than the `` gravy train '' was the adoption of the eu acquis , as it put additional pressure on uprooting bad habits and moving towards a more open society . 
  i 'm just saying that one should n't take a slogan , worse , a * rhyming * one , literally . 
  as being deported to the gulag meant an almost certain slow and painful death , i 'm not that sure that it 's so `` goddamn stupid '' that some of them preferred a quick and clean end . 
  also , the first wave of deportations from moldova ( around 25,000 people ) was carried out ** before ** the 1941 axis invasion and the subsequent horrors .
