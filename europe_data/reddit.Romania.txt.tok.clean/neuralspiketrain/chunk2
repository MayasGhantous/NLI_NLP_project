  i do n't know how `` capitalist '' you could consider romania was in the 1990s , seeing that its leaders were former communist apparatchiks and its economy was still vastly state-owned . 
   that 's why romanians comitted mass suicide when the russians showed up during wwii i think it has more to do with the 3 waves of mass deportations carried out by the soviets after occupying moldova : between 1941 and 1951 , around 60,000 ethnic romanians were deported from moldova to siberia and kazakhstan . 
  i do n't think that if you asked a russian at the beginning of the 20th century he would have said that his primary motivator is the fear of invasion . 
  russia may have suffered invasions in its past , but was n't exactly a helpless infant . 
  it also did itself the invading , countless times , at the expense of every one of its neighbors , from sweden and poland , to persia and china . 
  and on the whole , it came out in the black , expanding its territory more than ten times over , between the 15th and the 19th centuries , and arguably achieving its potential . 
  this paranoia is more than anything else an artificial product of 20th century history , sparked by the post-revolutionary civil war and then the german invasion of 1941 , yes , but kept alive intentionally through propaganda as one tool , among others , of keeping in check the masses , initially by the soviet regime , and now by putin . 
  fear is the best way to maintain discipline . 
  what is worrisome about the eu advancement to the current russian regime , is not so much a military threat ( which is nonexistent , as the eu completely lacks the means ) , but that a country culturally similar to russia might adopt successfully the western model , and thus threaten the system , already weakened by the causes you mentioned . 
  i do n't think this is about what russia , as a historical entity , fears , but about what putin , as an increasingly capricious and paranoid autocrat , fears : that the success of the partnership would give funny ideas to the russian public and undermine the narrative that his autocracy is the only way forward . 
   some nuts i do n't know ... not exactly your run-of-the-mill assorted fruitcakes . 
  i remember haymaking in my summer vacations as a city kid sent to help the grandparents on their farm . 
  it was the best part of the summer . 
  the work is n't that hard , the june-july weather is just right , not too hot , not too rainy , and nothing beats the scent of the cut grass . 
  even today i have vivid flashbacks when i pass a freshly mowed lawn in the city . 
   i believe the only thing that separates romania from bulgaria is the danube river and the language . 
  while this might be somewhat true about romania 's southern province , [ wallachia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachia ) , the two northern provinces , [ transylvania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ) and [ moldavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavia ) , have noticeable specificities in traditions , culture , history : transylvania likes to think of itself as part of mitteleuropa , moldavia ( especially northern moldavia ) is culturally closer to the ukraine . 
  this `` multiple personality syndrome '' is probably the most overlooked aspect about romania , not only by foreigners but also by its own people . 
  imho , it 's one of the main causes of the chronic political instability in the two periods when romania has had democracy ( between the two world wars and after the fall of communism ) . 
   the town is overrun by french and walloon people i do n't understand why are you talking about * them * as some kind of invading pest . 
  have n't walloons and flemings been living side-by-side for centuries ? 
  and and when i say `` side-by-side '' i mean it literally : i searched your town on the map and it is virtually * on the border * between flanders , wallonia and france . 
  some of its streets begin in belgium and end in france . 
  i do n't know , but most municipalities would welcome the opportunities coming from such positioning , not build legalistic walls against them . 
  please excuse me if i sound judgmental , but i come from a region long-plagued by inter-ethnic petty feuds , and it 's sad and rather disappointing to see them replicated in more prosperous corners of the world . 
   the radical left has an excellent record dealing with societal issues so have many societies with much less radical regimes : sweden , finland , germany , the uk , france , canada , even the us during the new deal era . 
  the stark choice between personal freedom and common welfare is the mother of all false dichotomies ( used btw not only by the far left , but by the far right too -- see the tea party ) . 
  there always is a middle way . 
   what makes you think that one of the oldest philosophical and political traditions of human culture ( egalitarianism ) can only have one exact type of manifestation ? 
  you 're putting words in my mouth , friend . 
  i have nothing against moderate egalitarianism . 
  what i find offensive is extremism . 
  anything , including egalitarianism , is unhealthy in large doses . 
  there is a myth , as old as egalitarianism itself , cautioning against its excesses : the bed of [ procrustes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/procrustes ) . 
  no , this is n't business as usual . 
  people as mr fenechiu here were , thanks to their political and moneyed connections , beyond the reach of justice just a few years ago . 
  and some of them still are . 
  as to if this is a sign of things clearly improving , it 's probably to early to tell : there are many things that could still be easily reversed , and there is considerable pressure applied to reverse them . 
  if you want to talk about a gaping hole , how about the history of transylvania ? 
  900 years of history are just summarily skipped over . 
  john hunyadi , the transylvanian school , the peasant revolt of horea , the 1848 revolution and the romanian national awakening are just about all students are taught . 
  almost nothing about the golden age of the principality in the 16th and 17th century , or about hungarians and germans . 
  of course the official excuse is that the subject of study is `` history of the * romanians * '' , not history of romania . 
  so , let 's choose only the advantageous data , because the unfavorable data is not representative ? 
  interesting , but not that surprising : that was exactly the way in which communist statistics functioned . 
  sure , ceausescu did crazy things . 
  but that is precisely the essence of communist regimes : because of the systematic repression of dissent , and because they always choose ideology over reality , they deterministically evolve into insanity . 
  the economic performance of communist romania after wwii is not that exceptional : between 1950-1989 , its gdp/capita grew 3.33 times . 
  in the same period , the gdp/capita of western europe grew 3.45 times . 
  the gdp/capita of greece grew 5.27 times , that of austria 4.41 times , that of turkey 3.1 times .

  edit : economical --  economic ; thanks , jonisausus . 
  well , it 's debatable . 
  no matter what what some pre-ww2 , mussolini-era piece of legislation says , latin was the language of the roman catholic church for almost two millennia . 
  besides , [ catholic monks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trappist_beer ) brew some of the finest beers in the known universe , so it 's only fair to them that the latin word would appear on a beer-related map . 
  sorry for the brevity . 
  late hour and all that . 
  here 's the long version : i guess the author uses the latin word * cervisia * to represent the vatican . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_vatican_city ) though , the vatican * does n't * have an official language . 
  its laws and regulations are published in italian , but the pope uses latin for his most important published documents . 
  on a more grammar-nazi note , the form used ( cervisia * m * ) is in the accusative case , with no discernible motive for that . 
  [ uk government 's position on the gchq snooping scandal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/js17izu.png ), 
  iirc , they used the same style of `` negotiations '' with japan not long ago , in the senkaku/diaoyu islands dispute . 
   a country that has so many scroungers like romania romania 's [ unemployment rate ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_april_2013.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130531083134 ) in april 2013 was 7.3 % . 
  higher than germany 's ( 5.4 % ) , yes , but lower than 20 other eu countries ' . 
  by your criterion , germany should n't have free movement with the uk ( 7.7 % ) , belgium ( 8.4 % ) , sweden ( 8.4 % ) , france ( 11 % ) , italy ( 12 % ) and so on . 
   germany could deport them back from where thy came from and what would keep them from coming back ? 
  true enough . 
  it may be completely wrong , but someone suggested to me today that romania has in fact the means with which to control danube 's water output , the dams and reservoirs at [ por\u0163ile de fier ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/por%c8%9bile_de_fier ) i and ii , and this is at least partly the reason why our fearless leaders are so nonchalant . 
  a rich country can not expect that only the best and the brightest will be attracted by the mirage of a better life . 
  i recently read that about [ 3 % of romanian doctors and 10 % of romanian nurses ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/social/studiu-aproape-3-dintre-medici-si-intre-5-si-10-dintre-asistentele-din-romania-emigreaza-in-fiecare-an-10914908 ) are leaving the country ** every year ** to work in western europe . 
  the percentage is n't probably very different for engineers , architects , physicists , pharmacists , plumbers , electricians etc. 
  is it so surprising that people without qualifications will also emigrate ? 
  in fact , the so-called scroungers are probably the most mobile group in any society . 
  they have the least to lose so they will not think twice before leaving . 
  and do not be deceived by the illusion that stricter border regulations will keep the rabble away . 
  the ones who will stay away are exactly the honest , law-abiding , ready to integrate , people . 
  those ready to break the law will not hesitate to do so to cross a border . 
  one can this see this exact phenomenon happening today in the uk . 
  edit : grammar . 
   in 2010 , then-russian president dmitry medvedev flew to yerevan to sign an agreement extending russia 's use of the gumri military base until 2045 . 
  [ ... ] political analyst aharon adibekian sarcastically wrote : `` when cornered by an enemy , do not resist . 
  do n't tense up . 
  just enjoy for maximum pleasure . '', 
  great quote . 
  lithuania 's case is not singular . 
  most of russia 's east european neighbours pay a lot more for their russian gas than western european countries . 
  the more a country is dependent on gazprom , the more expensive their gas is . 
  for instance , macedonia , who is 100 % dependent on gazprom , pays the largest price in europe : $ 564 per 1000 m3 . 
  compare that to the uk , who covers only 10 % of its needs with russian gas , and pays only $ 313 for it .

  thank you for your enlightening data , although it 's still far from your initially presumed 8 % acceptance level . 
  i only corrected you in the first place because i made a analogy between the three countries , all largely orthodox christian , all within the same historical region , with somewhat similar traditions , and similar political systems today . 
  probably both romania and cyprus , more along the lines of greece : 53 % . 
  i 'm always surprised at the number of austrians with slavic-sounding family names . 
  i know it 's because of the empire , but still . 
  the neighbours : * bulgarians : they 're just like us , but they also like roses and cucumbers . 
  * serbians : just like us , but with a really quick temper . 
  * hungarians : just like us , but they also like paprika and violin music . 
  * ukrainians : just like us , but with blonder hair and bluer eyes .
