  * moldovans : they * are * us . 
  * the black sea : the best neighbour . 
  well , generally romanians feel they 're seen as that weird cousin who did n't quite make it in the world . 
  you somehow wish you could help him , so you let him mow your lawn for a couple of pennies and you let him sleep in the garage for the summer . 
  when he 's finally gone you realize that some of your silverware is missing , and your phone bill inexplicably shows a lot of premium-charge calls . 
  then the wife says something like that would have * never * happened with someone in * her * family , and that she always knew something was not ok , and maybe the tan the cousin got over the summer was n't really a tan , but was * always * there , and that this explains it all . 
  is n't vlaams blok/vlaams belang 's ideology primarily linked to flemish independence rather than anti-immigration ? 
  i can confirm that . 
  it was a part of romania the last time i checked , too . 
  the same as occitania was a part of france or sicily a part of italy . 
  i do n't think a patch of 17x12 pixels changes that . 
  it just adds a bit of local color to the european quilt . 
  now wait a minute . 
  corruption ? 
  crime ? 
  i can see only pragmatism : a decision based , and rightly so , on the realities of the moment , then and now . 
  in 2008 , before the downturn , the decision was made to sustain investments , local and foreign , in wind energy . 
  it was a sound decision : harnessing an undeveloped natural potential and bringing much needed capital into the economy . 
  today , the cost of the subsidies for wind energy , which are passed unto the consumer , has grown so much it threatens the viability of other industries . 
  therefore the backstep , or at least slowdown . 
  i understand both reasonings . 
  but that does n't mean i 'm not slightly amused by the irony of the situation . 
  ---------------------------  the republican party in the us in 2000 , bush jr won the presidency with a promise of `` compassionate conservatism '' , a step towards the center , and he acted on it . 
  ( that does n't mean he was less of an sob . 
  only that it was for other reasons . ), 
  also , both mccain and romney were to the left of the main base of the party . 
   the nationalist right wingers popping up all over europe . 
  yes , they exist . 
  but they did not , until now , win any general elections . 
  they are still only a fringe . 
  hence the adverb * nominally * . 
  but i do n't think this trend is limited to romanian politics . 
  the slide towards the center of the ideological spectrum is present in countries all over the world . 
  the ironic thing is that the legislation favoring investments in green energy was enacted under a nominally right-of-center government , and it is a nominally left-of-center one that is taking steps back . 
  also romanian : * horea or horia ( male ) , from the verb * a hori * , to sing . 
  * doina ( female ) , from * doin\u0103 * , a genre of folk songs . 
  * mioara ( female ) , from * mioar\u0103 * , little lamb . 
  * ozana ( female ) , from the alternate name of the river neam\u0163 . 
  * z\u00e2na ( female ) , from * z\u00e2n\u0103 * , fairy . 
  * doru , dorin ( male ) , dorina ( female ) , from * dor * , wistfulness . 
  * dacian ( male ) , daciana ( female ) , from * dac * , [ dacian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacians ) . 
  * codrin ( male ) , codru\u0163a ( female ) , from * codru * , forest . 
  * sorin ( male ) , sorina ( female ) , from * soare * , sun . 
  * viorel ( male ) , viorica ( female ) , from * viorea * , bluebell . 
  i would n't call rt 's bias `` leftist '' . 
  it 's more like `` western social & cultural liberalism : bad , putin-style authoritarianism : good . '', 
  this would really go down well in / r/nottheonion . 
  positively < 3 loved < 3 the giant blood vials . 
  [ the results ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/dvs/dvt/lgbt.php ) are pretty different from those of the survey concerning [ national legal frameworks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1egogk/rainbow_map_may_2013_human_rights_of_lgbt_people/ ) . 
  probably more relevant , too : the legal frameworks say how the various governments officially deal with things , this survey shows what the general public thinks about them . 
  the two country scores are not that different ( 29 % vs 31 % ) . 
  according to their country profiles , ilga says that [ romania ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/publications/reports_and_other_materials/rainbow_europe/score_sheet/romania_score_sheet_based_on_rainbow_europe_map_2013 ) scores better than [ switzerland ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/publications/reports_and_other_materials/rainbow_europe/score_sheet/switzerland_score_sheet_based_on_rainbow_europe_map_2013 ) in legislation concerning protection against hate speech ( 36 % vs 0 % ) , law and policies against discrimination ( 23 % vs 15 % ) , and asylum law ( 25 % vs 0 % ) . 
  switzerland has , on the other hand , more inclusive laws regarding family recognition ( 40 % vs 8 % ) . 
  the fact is romania has very much improved its legal framework , especially in the last decade , not least because of requirements for admission into the eu . 
  edit : grammar . 
  the party from the * ~ ~ der ~ ~ spiegel article is n't anti-eu , it 's anti-euro ( as in common currency ) . 
   what does ` latina savante ' mean ? 
  i guess it could be translated as `` science latin '' . 
  basically it means latin loanwords , terms adopted in the modern era for technical usage , long after the birth of the language . 
  for instance : * from the latin * vesica * ( bladder ) , comes * b\u0103\u015fic\u0103 * ( bladder , popular ) through direct filiation , and * vezic\u0103 * ( vesica , medical ) as a technical loanword , * from the latin * auscultare * ( to listen ) , comes * a asculta * ( to listen ) through direct filiation , and * a ausculta * ( to auscultate , medical ) through loan .

   hungary was a multicultural nation before ww i. descriptively , yes . 
  ideologically , no . 
  as an ideology , multiculturalism did n't appear until the 1960s and '70s . 
  in fact , after the 1867 ausgleich , the hungarian state followed an aggressive policy of assimilating non-hungarians : * severely limited access to education in languages other than hungarian , at all levels , * censitary electoral system , practically eliminating the mostly low-income non-hungarians , * direct magyarization of names , as an official state policy . 
   maybe , but i doubt it . 
  i know this is rather academic and irrelevant to the current situation , but how would such a `` helping hand '' have been mounted ? 
  keeping these in mind : * a un security council resolution was proposed but was vetoed by ussr ; * a un general assembly resolution was adopted but was ignored by the soviets ; not actually surprising , seeing that unga resolutions are * non-binding * ; * nato did not have at the time a common border with hungary ; any intervention in hungary would have also meant a violation of another country 's territory ; * any direct military nato intervention without un sanction would have probably triggered a retaliative invasion of west germany by the warsaw pact , ergo world war iii . 
   what would hungary look like right now if the rest of us had given them a hand in 56 ? 
  it would probably look like a nuclear fallout-covered plain , in the middle of a radioactive europe . 
   well , to be fair , they kinda got screwed . 
  i 'd say rather that a situation where the hungarian state was screwing right about all of its neighbouring nations was corrected . 
  this map does n't get enough publicity : [ ethnic groups of the hungarian kingdom according to the 1880-census ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:hungary-ethnic_groups.jpg ), 
  is n't it funny how a thread about hungary 's far-right anti-semitism suddenly morphed into one blaming hungary 's * neighbours * ?

  it seems that the `` three capitals '' method is not exactly new , having been developed almost 30 years ago by the french sociologist pierre bourdieu . 
  my bad . 
  the article seems rather hollow , without the actual * percentages * for the seven classes . 
  clever , though , the use of the `` three capitals '' . 
  til : hungary is the only former eastern bloc nation that did not adopt an entirely new constitution after the fall of communism . 
  the 1949 constitution , although heavily amended , remained in power after 1989 until 2011 when was replaced by the current constitution .

  the latinized form of * diutisc * is * theodiscus * . 
  from latin , it passed into italian . 
  le : being the doofus that i am , i realized just now that my answer was incomplete . 
  the name * germania * comes from the name given by the gauls to a germanic tribe living on the western bank of the rhine . 
  it was used in writing for the first time by julius caesar . 
  later , but still in roman times , it was extended to cover similar tribes and the area understood to be their homeland . 
   self immolation is i imagine one of the most horrific ways to die even if someone decides to end his own life , to also choose to spend his last moments suffering such horrendous pain is beyond my humble comprehension . 
  not for all the public awareness in the world . 
  in italian , germans are * tedeschi * . 
  same origin as deutsch . 
  the country is * germania * , though . 
   the romanians are borderline paranoid , given how [ ... ] the ghosts of irredentism still haunt some people about that . 
  mr tokes , speaking at the yesterday rally , declared among other things : `` the [ trianon treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ) must cease to exist ^ 1 [ ... ] '' . 
  personally , i 'm ready to accept that he was speaking in a metaphorical sense ( given the guy 's history of sticking his foot in his mouth ) , but ultimately such firebreathing rhetoric is the last thing that we need in transylvania . 
  perhaps it 's relevant to remark that the main political party of the hungarian community in romania ** did not ** participate to this rally , and even considered important to distance themselves from it ^ 1 ^ 2 , their position being that street protests will not be helpful in achieving the community 's goals .
