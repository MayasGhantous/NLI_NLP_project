  working together with other people ( who may or may not think exactly like you ) is what makes a group of individuals a society . 
  nothing to do with `` selling out '' . 
  trying to impose the views of a minority ( even one who sees itself as being at the forefront of progress ) over the entirety of a society is what makes a dictatorship . 
  it 's sad that after a century of totalitarian experiments , from the left and from the right , we are still not capable of seeing that evolution is always preferable to revolution . 
  why ? 
  because the means always taint and deform the purpose . 
  `` trying to shake things up '' is a mild euphemism for his agenda . 
  so , basically , after refusing to participate in any coalition , and thus blocking the political system , mr grillo rages because the president of the republic tries to form a technocratic government . 
  very mature . 
  so there is a debate going on on whether you should stack firewood bark up or bark down . 
  huh . 
  must be the weirdest moment of revelation i 've had since i 've found out about the [ over or under toilet paper dispute ] ( http://news.cnet.com/over-or-under-the-science-of-toilet-paper-orientation/8301-17938_105-20061128-1.html ) . 
  not sure , but maybe because it 's * real * ? 
  ... from the [ pelasgians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_densu%c5%9fianu ) , rather . 
  zoinks !, 
  irl , * both * bohemia and moravia are parts of the czech republic . 
  but this map does n't have that much to do with * real * life . 
  there is no czech republic on this map . 
  its territory is divided between bohemia and moravia . 
  this is a circular argument if i ever saw one : are we saying they are like this because they are like this , or are they like this because we say they are like this ? 
  what it comes to in the end , i guess , is the following : are they or are us responsible for their present situation ? 
  probably a bit of both . 
   not at bad analogies , apparently . 
  i am applying the exact same rule you are . 
   surely conjuring up all the bad conotations when you say somebody is \u201e a gypsy '' can not help . 
  i thought that if you want to help the social advancement of a people the first step is to * correct * the bad behaviours associated with it , not just hide them under the rug . 
   about 39,500,000 results ( 0.29 seconds ) and that does proves ... what ? 
  then maybe we should stop calling people from sicily sicilians because the term carries a connotation of affiliation with the mafia . 
  stop calling calling people from germany germans because it carries a connotation of nazism . 
  where does this stop ? 
  but more importantly : how does this help ? 
  i guess today is your first day surfing the internet , then . 
  so , * gypsy * is insulting . 
  not when used in certain context , but insulting per se . 
  why ? 
  well , they do . 
  * romania , the land of the roma * . 
  does that sound familiar ? 
   those are endonyms hungarians = exonym , magyars = endonym . 
  greeks = exonym , elines = endonym . 
  in every case , the usual term is the * exo * nym . 
   but maybe we should call ourselves olah/vlah , just in case . 
  * we * should call ourselves whatever * we * wish . 
  what others call us in * their * language is another matter completely . 
  anyway , my question was n't answered : are exonyms insulting in english ? 
  if not , what 's so special about * gypsy * ? 
  edit : exo-ing some endos and endo-ing some exos . 
  yes , both * gypsy * and * vlach * -- * olah * in hungarian -- are exonyms . 
  but i do n't think i 've ever met a fellow romanian saying he was insulted by being called * wallachian * . 
  and , regarding * gypsy * : is there a rule in english saying you can not call a people by its exonym ? 
  there are a lot of exonyms used in english : hungarians call themselves magyar , greeks call themselves elines , japanese call themselves nippon , and so on . 
  are those exonyms ( hungarian , greek , japanese ) insulting too ? 
  edit : added segment between brackets . 
  hey , you still have the cutest accent . 
  not to mention arabela . 
  ^ ^ only ^ 80s ^ kids ^ will ^ get ^ this, 
  in romanian , * zeu * ( plural * zei * ) is only used when speaking of gods , with a small g . the abrahamic god is referred to as * dumnezeu * ( the lord ) , from the latin vocative * domine deus * . 
   how much of it happens inside the foreign communities and how many victims are italian ? 
  according to op 's article , 68.9 % of the rape victims were italian , compared to 60.9 % of the perps being italian ( in 2009 ) . 
   towards italy , over the adriatic from macedonia or greece into albania , and then over to brindisi or bari , on the heel of the italian boot . 
  could be . 
  i do n't think it 's a matter of where serbia buses them . 
  they seem pretty aware of the news and willing to challenge state authority . 
  if they come to romania and still want to reach western europe , they will have to enter hungary , and hungary just made illegal border crossing a felony . 
  else , they would have to go all the way up north to the ukrainian border and then try their luck with slovakia or poland . 
   i 'm trying to think of any situation where you would get those three people in a room together , especially without other randoms . 
  it 's a jab at ceau\u0219escu 's cult of personality . 
  during his era , 99 % of foreign news bulletins related to how much the beloved helmsman was respected by world leaders , from nixon and the queen of england to mobutu and mugabe . 
   i can never remember any jokes . 
  that in itself qualifies as a transylvanian joke . 
  *** two transylvanians on two hilltops : `` heeeey , neighbor ! '', 
  `` what did you give your heifer when it fell sick ? '', 
  `` kerosene , neighbor ! '', 
  a week passes . 
  same two guys on the same hilltops : `` heeeey , neighbor ! '', 
  `` what did you say you gave your heifer when it fell sick ? '', 
  `` kerosene , neighbor ! '', 
  `` but my heifer died , neighbor ! '', 
  `` mine too , neighbor , mine too . '', 
  you fail to see the forest because of the trees . 
  most of that horrendous shit happened because all these nation-states , romania included , acted only in self-interest , disregarding the interest of their neighbors , trying to pull a fast one on each other , trying to destabilize , conquer , destroy each other . 
  i 'm not saying self-interest is bad , i 'm saying that self-interest augmented by cooperation instead of discord and antagonism is better . 
   these countries survived for 100 years without eu . 
  * survived * being the keyword . 
  * survived * , not * prospered * . 
  by the skin of their teeth . 
  just think a little about it . 
  even the czechs , so proudly independent today . 
  they began the century without a state of their own , and once they had one , it was twice invaded , once by the nazis , once by the soviets . 
  they muddled through 50 years of totalitarianism . 
  they * survived * . 
  barely . 
  let 's take romania . 
  in both world wars , we lost everything but the shirt on our back , and we pulled through only by acts of sheer desperation and through incredible chance . 
  we had right-wing dictators , left-wing dictators , pogroms , peasant revolts , deportations , political prisons , an illiterate shoemaker as god-king , hunger , street revolts , coups d'etat . 
  would you be content with a repeat of that hundred years ? 
  i know i would n't be . 
  thank you . 
  here in romania , we had to pay for tap water as far back as i can remember , including under the communist rule , though tariffs have gone up significantly lately . 
  a bit of context , please ?
