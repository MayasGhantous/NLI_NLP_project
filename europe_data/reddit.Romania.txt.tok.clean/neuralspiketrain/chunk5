  why does the right to protest need to be defended ?

  the 1939 borders were different from today 's , though . 
  i see . 
  thank you . 
  honestly curious . 
  how does one date stone structures ? 
  you ca n't use c-14 , since they 're not organic . 
  transylvanian romanians did not leave austria-hungary because `` they hated hungarians '' . 
  they separated because they refused to live in a country where [ even ** petitioning the monarch ** for recognition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_memorandum ) was considered an act of treason . 
  kafka wrote about the other side of the k. und k. : the bureaucracy , the alienation , the persecution . 
  and franz kafka was n't romanian . 
   the eu killed british fishing [ british fishing was in steep decline since at least the 1960s . 
  ] ( http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v1/n2/full/ncomms1013.html#/ ) the main factor for this was the stock depletion brought about by industrial fishing . 
  i 'm not quite sure i understand what you mean . 
  if a political party representing a national minority has more than 5 % of the vote , it will receive the corresponding number of seats in parliament . 
  if it has less than 5 % it will receive one seat in parliament , regardless of the number of votes it has . 
  also , these rules only apply to general elections . 
  for local elections the rules are different and much less rigid . 
  true . 
  10 % is pretty steep . 
  that rule only applies to national minorities , in order to guarantee their representation . 
  for the rest of the political parties , the electoral threshold is 5 % . 
  for electoral alliances , the threshold is calculated by adding 3 % for ~ ~ every additional member in the alliance ~ ~ the second member in the alliance , and 1 % for the third and subsequent members . 
  it may sound strange to modern ears and perhaps that 's why this comment is downvoted , but it 's true . 
  as a consequence of the [ peasant revolt of 1437 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budai_nagy_antal_revolt ) , and under the provisions of the [ unio trium nationum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum ) , the medieval estate of the orthodox romanians in transylvania , * [ universitas valachorum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universitas_valachorum ) * , gradually lost most of their rights . 
  they were forbidden to live or purchase houses in the cities . 
  they were not allowed to build stone churches . 
  they were discriminated against in justice proceedings :  the romanian could not appeal for justice against hungarians and saxons , but the latter could turn in the romanian ( 1552 ) ; the hungarian ( hungarus ) accused of robbery could be defended by the oath of the village judge and three honest men , while the romanian ( valachus ) needed the oath of the village knez , four romanians and three hungarians ( 1542 ) ; the hungarian peasant could be punished after being accused by seven trustworthy people , while the romanian was punished after accusations by only three ( 1554 ) .

  i 'm sorry but i think you 're wrong . 
  there is frustration , but not so much with local hungarian communities , as with the confrontational way in which the present government in budapest sees fit to protect their interests . 
  it seems to me that under the ~ ~ former ~ ~ previous government things were really starting to improve , with bilateral meetings with neighboring countries and a ~ ~ detente ~ ~ toning down in rhetoric . 
  agreed , one would expect a bit more decorum from a guy of his standing . 
  i see , thanks . 
  and to answer myself the first question , they probably flew over ? 
  i just asked because somehow traveling by plane with the hog put away nicely in the cargo hold does n't quite match the whole outlaw/biker ethos . 
  how did they get to slovakia , if they were banned from passing through poland and ukraine ? 
  also i gather that at least some of them were not granted schengen visas , and slovakia is a schengen member . 
  notwithstanding the clickbait title , the gist of the piece stands :  the psychological repercussions of this fundamentally new situation on europe 's political elites are both brutal and curious at the same time . 
  those aged 45 to 65 currently in positions of power have only known growing prosperity , freedom and cultural sophistication . 
  they were , and to a large extent still are , predisposed to exert themselves only modestly , act responsibly and expect that they could enjoy the fruits of their labor . 
  and suddenly history has unceremoniously grabbed them by the scruff of the neck . 
  do we really need to fight now ? 
  more than ever ? 
  and what does our cardiologist have to say ?

  i think it was meant to be sarcastic . 
  i had to google [ cockta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cockta ) . 
  i think [ gorenje ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorenje ) is better known , around here at least . 
  if you mean the hat from the first definition , it 's [ pretty sweet indeed . 
  ] ( http://www.tedsclothiers.com/wp-content/uploads/041105v.jpg ) if you mean the one from the * second * pic , that 's an illustration for the word pana\u0219 ( ~ panache , [ plume ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plume_%28feather%29 ) ) . 
  here it is as found in two dead-tree dictionaries : [ * \u0218\u0103ineanu 1929 * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jbkos6o.jpg ) does not have this meaning , only as `` very supple hat , made from the leaves of a central american tree '' . 
  [ * dlrm 1958 * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hrk0dz2.jpg ) has it , as the second meaning : `` fraudulent business of large proportions , involving many individuals . '', 
   al-ghazali has been referred to by some historians as the single most influential muslim after the islamic prophet muhammad . 
  within islamic civilization he is considered to be a mujaddid or renewer of the faith , who , according to tradition , appears once every century to restore the faith of the community . 
  his works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that al-ghazali was awarded the honorific title `` proof of islam '' ( hujjat al-islam ) . 
  from the introduction to the [ al-ghazali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-ghazali ) article in wikipedia . 
  every sentence has at least one reference note . 
  irrelevant as far as today 's islamic schools of thought are indebted to al-ghazali and not to al-andalus philosophers such as averroes . 
   spain had a scientific and cultural golden age under arab rule . 
  ... and then [ al-ghazali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_incoherence_of_the_philosophers#legacy ) happened . 
  they 're called * minciunele * ( little lies ) around here . 
  the tainting had been established , intentionally or not , through the first question . 
  repeating it was superfluous . 
  iohannis is lutheran , like most transylvanian saxons . 
  but the part about the letters is true . 
   some analysts say the suruc bombing was an inevitable consequence of the government 's syria policy . 
  the practice of allowing jihadi volunteers to cross the border to fight in syria has seeded turkey with is sympathizers . 
  strikingly similar to what happened with pakistan , as the jihadis they sponsored in kashmir and afghanistan came back to bite them in the arse . 
  i truly hope that what followed there is not a sign of things to come in turkey . 
   why would that not be considered fair ? 
  i do think hard brexit would be fair . 
  i did not say it sarcastically . 
  at the same time , it would still be rock bottom . 
  sixty years of cooperation out the window . 
  everything torn down and having to be rebuilt . 
  it 's the worst solution possible . 
  the easiest , yes , but also the worst . 
   they cant pick and choose between the free movement of goods , persons , capital or services . 
  it 's either all of them . 
  or none . 
  i agree the four must go together . 
  but is it really a matter of all or nothing ? 
  it should be possible to find some middle ground , a certain level of * every * one of the four that is mutually acceptable . 
  i also think the ball is in uk 's court . 
  they should be the ones making the first move towards this middle ground , as they were the ones who started this mess . 
  yes , i suppose rock bottom would be mutually fair . 
  the problem is that what the uk considers fair is very different from what the eu considers fair . 
   danish consumers who does not use russian gas pays some of the highest prices . 
  that seems to be more a matter of internal policy than anything else . 
  looking at [ this graph ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/4/4f/natural_gas_prices_for_household_consumers%2c_second_half_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb16.png ) that you linked , more than half of the gas price for domestic/household consumers in denmark is taxes and levies . 
   eastern europe does not appear to be ripped off .
