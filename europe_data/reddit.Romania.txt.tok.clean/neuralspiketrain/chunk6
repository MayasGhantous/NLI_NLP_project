  in fact they get a pretty good deal and a lower price than many in western europe in 2013 , the price-establishing mechanism of gazprom was leaked to the press . 
  [ this is what it looked like . 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/a/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html ), 
  the gas price for domestic consumers is very different from the price of imported gas . 
  the former is influenced by subventions and social policies . 
  the latter is established in ee mainly by gazprom through its monopoly position . 
  [ here is a press release by the european commission concluding that gazprom is abusing that position . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-4829_en.htm ), 
  and the fact that , for a change , trump is sticking to the script and letting others do the thinking . 
  he 's just returning now to the numbers a plain vanilla gop candidate would have . 
  officially , russia does not have regular ground troops in syria anymore . 
  putin himself [ declared on march 14 of this year ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35807689 ) , more than six months ago , that the objectives of russia 's intervention were achieved and that regular russian troops were beginning their pullout from syria . 
  so , yes , it 's a secret . 
  an open secret , to be sure , but surrounded by enough uncertainty and lack of evidence to provide plausible deniability to the kremlin . 
  that 's exactly what an news article like this , based on interviews with dozens of family members of soldiers still fighting in syria , is bringing . 
  obviously my sarcasm was lost in translation . 
  they 're * not * mercenaries . 
  mercenaries * do not * receive official military medals . 
  their families * do not * receive $ 100,000 compensations from the state . 
  and even if they were , and even if others were doing it , that does not make it right . 
  mercenaries , flying in and out of syria on russian military aircraft , deploying from the russian base of tartous , being treated in russian military hospitals , receiving russian military medals , and whose families receive compensations from the russian state when they die . 
  because putin declared `` mission accomplished '' in syria in march of this year . 
  he does n't want to be seen as sending russian youths to die for assad . 
  so they 're `` mercenaries '' . 
   officially , russia is participating only in an air war over syria with a small number of special forces on the ground . 
  moscow denies that its troops are involved in regular ground combat operations . 
   however , in interviews with more than a dozen people with direct knowledge of these deployments , reuters has established that russian fighters are playing a more substantial role in ground combat than that the role the kremlin says is being played by the regular russian military . 
   the sources described the russian fighters as contractors or mercenaries , hired by a private company , rather than regular troops . 
  but despite their unofficial status , according to these accounts , they operate in coordination with the russian military and are given privileges back home normally available only to serving soldiers . 
   they fly to syria on board russian military aircraft which land at russian bases . 
  when they are injured , they are treated in hospitals reserved for the russian military and get state medals , people interviewed by reuters said . 
  the name * dumitru * , together with its diminutive * mitic\u0103 * , is less frequent in transylvania than in the old kingdom . 
  this goes to such an extent that * mitic\u0103 * is used as a nickname for inhabitants of southern romania , especially for bucharesters . 
  there 's even a pretty good [ english wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitic%c4%83 ) about this . 
   prone to being criminals according to the stats in the op , 0.39 % of romanian expats/migrants are in prison . 
  that 's one in every 256 . 
  not exactly qualifies as an ethnic propensity towards crime . 
  just for comparison , the dutch have 0.24 % -- one in every 416 dutch expats/migrants is in prison ( higher than two thirds of the countries on that list ) . 
  yes .

  are you seriously going to stand there and say with a straight face that there 's no difference between the absolute size of something and its relative size compared to something else ? 
  i actually did notice after i posted the comment that i had linked to the current not the constant prices gdp/capita . 
  my bad to not have edited with the correct one . 
  that does not invalidate the basics of what i said , though . 
  i did not want to `` debunk '' the graph here , and it is indeed hilarious that you thought so . 
  i only wanted to attract attention to the fact that it can not be used to illustrate the actual gdp/capita growth of the eu15 member countries -- as some had already done -- , but only the relative rate at which the gdp/capita of the member countries evolved compared to each other . 
  edit : grammar, 
  let me rephrase it : k / s, 
  well , it already misled some people in this thread . 
   then you 're incorrect . 
  why , i believe it was yourself , in the very first comment on this page :  is every death in the uk going to be posted on this sub or what ? 
  i might be wrong , but i interpret that as saying this particular murder is not newsworthy enough ( as in significant enough , as in insignificant ) to be talked about outside of the uk . 
  this graph is a bit misleading . 
  the eu15 gdp/capita in 1996 was smaller than the eu15 gdp/capita in 2015 . 
  that is significant because , for example , while indeed italy 's percentage is falling on this graph , in terms of * real * gdp/capita , actually [ italy had growth . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd?end=2015&amp;locations=it&amp;start=1996 ), 
  it must be my poor english , but i ca n't really make head or tails of what you 're saying . 
  do you have knowledge that the attackers were muslim ? 
  were the attackers muslim in this incident or in other incidents too ? 
  if so , are muslims specifically attacking east europeans ? 
  and if so , are british `` right-wingers '' defending east europeans against muslims ? 
  look at the comments . 
  it 's a circlejerk , indeed . 
  about how all these attacks against east europeans are insignificant , random , unconnected . 
  `` nothing to see here , move along , citizen . '', 
  honestly , this attitude is just as disheartening as the attacks themselves .

  also , is it the rise in prejudice causing distortion in the perception of diversity , or it 's the other way around ?
