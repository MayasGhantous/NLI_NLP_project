that 's a small cost if you compare it with the benefits of living in a multicultural society : people from so many advanced cultures and societies are coming to europe . 
  we have so many things to learn from them . 
  it would be so dull to live with people with similar values . 
  things they have some things in common : megalomania , nationalism ( not patriotism ) , etc. , but they are different beasts living in different times . 
  ceausescu was an atheist , erdogan is a muslim trying to impose muslim values , etc. 
  both ceausescu and erdogan are just good guys , turned small despots because they lack the tools to protect themselves from their own inflated egos . 
  power corrupts . 
  for those who are not familiar with the megalomaniac [ ceausescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_ceau%c8%99escu ) was , here is a [ reference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament ) :  the palace of parliament ( romanian : palatul parlamentului ) in bucharest , romania is a multi-purpose building containing both chambers of the romanian parliament . 
  according to the world records academy , the palace is the world 's largest civilian building with an administrative function , most expensive administrative building and heaviest building . 
  small people build enormous buildings . 
  i ridicule the leftist beliefs all the time . 
  i was convicted to have a low karma for that ... 
  bulgaria ye crasiva strana !, 
  * i really like budapest architecture - great place to spend a few days . 
  * i really love bulgarian people , very friendly and cool . 
  * i love ... polish beer . 
  can into europe if me am poor gypsy lad , will do everything ? 
  romanian : euro ( with an * e * like in * e * lephant and the u like the sound in sh * oo * t - e-u-ro ) and cent ( pronounced tchent ) . 
  euro has no plural , but sometimes people say `` euroi '' which is an augmentative form and sounds funny . 
  mainly used as a joke . 
  the plural for cent is cen\u021bi ( pronounced centzi ) . 
  - romanians have a very bad reputation in europe , and the gypsy romanian minority helped a lot . 
  the average european does n't even know the difference between romani and romanian people . 
  the first sentence i 've heard in france when i went there to work ( in a bank ) was : `` you do n't look like the romanians we know . '', 
  i felt obliged to answer : `` you do n't look french either . '', 
  and so our collaboration started ... - romania has a long history of failed social policies with gypsies . 
  they are seen as second-class citizens ( that 's in the culture of that part of europe not only romania ) , scums , filthy beggars , etc. , and those stereotypes are centuries old . 
  when i was a kid , i was a little bully . 
  my mothet would always tell me : `` be nice , or the gypsy will steal you from us . '', 
  the things are slowly improving , but it will take time . 
  for example in elementary school i had two gypsy colleagues . 
  very poor , but decent guys . 
  we did n't discriminated them because they were cool , and our teacher played a very protective role with them . 
  now , one of them is a teacher and the other is a mechanic . 
  unfortunately i can give you a lot of counter-examples . 
  it takes time . 
  burzum is irrelevant in this discussion . 
  have you ever burned a church ? 
  is true that language creates artificial barriers , but in the same any human with a normal intellect can learn one or two additional languages . 
  also i think that this diversity of cultures and languages ( and genes ) in europe could help us in the long run to create something great on earth . 
  we do n't have to immitate america , we can have it our way . 
  but , but , but romanians also suffer from `` incredible '' racist abuse in europe , and nobody cries for them . 
  they have 2 % ... 
  that 's what nationalistic politicians are trying to suggest . 
  i must say that romania does n't have a far right/nationalistic political party . 
  on the other hand the hungarians have . 
  the last scandal i remember , is that a group of young hungarian nationalist ( from hungary , not romania ) started to paint `` mountain marks '' with the hungarian flag ... that 's not something inherently bad , but a bit offensive . 
  all in all , the young generation of romanians , really do n't have a problem with the hungarian minority , and so is the young generation of hungarians have nothing against the romanian majority . 
  i am sure than in 15-20 years , there will 0 tensions between the two groups . 
  ps : at work i have two magyars as colleagues . 
  we always make fun about the natioanalists . 
  the hungarians have access to schools in their native language , some of the hungarians cultural events are state-sponsored . 
  on romanian national television there 's even a ** [ tv show ] ( http://www3.tvr.ro/magyar/ ) ** in hungarian . 
  in some universities you can study hungarian literature and culture : http://hunlit.lett.ubbcluj.ro/ro/profesori/varga-p-ildiko , etc. 
  the hungarians have an ethnically-based political party that had all the time representatives in the romanian parliament . 
  almost every government had magyar ministers . 
  i do n't think that magyar suffer any kind of injustice in romania because of their ethnicity . 
  romanian fluent in english and french . 
  can understand and have moderate ability to talk : spanish ( i know very little grammar ) and to a lower extenct italian . 
  basic conversation : hebrew, 
  congratulations to our fellow neighbors and friends from across the danube . 
  somebody made a fortune today in forex . 
  euro / usd dropped 200 pips . 
  europe 50 index is going high . 
  gbp/usd also dropped . 
  today dollar was the champion . 
   what has that got to do with illegal immigrants coming to europe from northern africa . 
  we are more savage and uncivilized compared to the highly skilled north african specialists . 
  you can not block us abusing your welfare . 
  you need to read the whole article . 
  i am sure they will be smart enough to change the route . 
  anyway , prepare yourself for the next wave of romanians , and our fellow bulgarians - we are coming !, 
  great tip . 
  thanks !, 
  quiz over . 
  you scored 138 out of 141 . 
  your score is 97 % . 
  the baltic states have killed me . 
  there are many suppositions : 1 . 
  slavic : * biez gora * ( without mountains/country ) , * biez gorod * ( without cities ) - which is funny , because the hungarians in transilvania lived in the cities , while the indigenous population ( romanians ) was ~ ~ forbidden ~ ~ discouraged to do so . 
  * bazd meg * which is a some swearing that hungarian romanians use ( used ) . 
  but i think is only a supposition . 
  there is also an archaic romanian verb `` a boscorodi '' - means that you are saying something without any sense , you mumble something . 
  the etymology of this verb is related to a turkic population called the [ bashkirs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bashkirs ) , called * bascor/baschir/bozcor * in romanian . 
  it 's funny because in romania we have some other expressions related with the turks , and the language barrier . 
  when a person does n't understand what you 've said you ask him : `` esti turc ? '', 
  - meaning `` are you a turk ? 
  yeah , it 's hilarous , but this is how the hate goes . 
  hungarians call us primitives/smelly/stinky olahs ( from valach , vlachs , ancient name for romanians ) , and romanians call them `` bozgors ( the etymology of this word is disputed ) , go back in the steppe '' . 
  well , it was a joke , but i think that the younger generations of romanians and hungarians do n't have a problem with each other . 
  the problem was that after the fall of communism , we had some politicians ( both romanian and hungarian , but i must admit the romanian ones were more vocal ) who fueled tensions between the romanian majority and the hungarian minority in order to raise political capital . 
  nationalism was the norm in the 90s in romania , the political slogan : `` we do n't sell our country ! '', 
  won the elections . 
  but nowadays , anti-hungarian rhetoric is less and less visible . 
  sure we hear sometimes in the news , that a hungarian extremist burned a romanian flag , and the ignorant people go shouting in the newspaper comments : `` fucking hungarians , go back from where you came from , bla bla bla '' for a few days , but after a week , everyone forgets about the incident and buys [ k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%bcrt%c5%91skal%c3%a1cs ) . 
  personally i think that in 10-20 years there will be no tension left , and chauvinism will be buried . 
  maybe i am just a dreamer . 
  i believe that if we want our european ideals to survive ( those things we 've eventually discovered the hard-way - after 2000 years of fraticide wars ) , we need to make more babies , and raise them in the spirit of tolerance , peace and cohabitation . 
  sure , massive migration from non-european countries can be a solution , but immigrants can not solve this problem in the long term . 
  i believe europe needs a good plan to combat the demographic problem .
