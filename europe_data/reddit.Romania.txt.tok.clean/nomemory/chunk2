  you can not simply oblige people to make more children . 
  you should come to romania , we need more hungarians in transilvania . 
  the most merciful . 
  turkey ( in the romanian language - turcia ) is a country with great cultural sites , very nice beaches and people there are very welcoming with the tourist ( even if they do n't need to ) . 
  i like that turkey is , regarding the current leadership , a modern muslim country , and can be an example for others . 
  things that turkey should to improve the image in the world : as a romanian citizen , i can only say that the turkish minority in romania , is very peaceful , living a healthy existence with the other ethnics in the region of dobrogea : romanians , [ aromanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians ) , [ tatars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatars ) , bulgarians , greeks , [ lipovans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) and the remaining and shrinking jewish minority . 
  in the centre of bucharest we even have a statue of [ ataturk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_of_romania#mediaviewer/file:bucharest_odeon.jpg ) , and a piata ( piazza ) named after him . 
  as a tourist i can only say good things about the services in turkey , i can recommend any fellow european to visit them . 
  it would be cool if turkey : - get rid of erdogan and replace him with a real leader , not a demagogically religious zealot . 
  i mean you need a leader like ataturk , to help turkey make the next leap towards a new society , a person who will build more bridges instead of demolishing the existing ones . 
  - turkey should focus on gaining more leadership in the area , and become an example for its neighbors , especially in the east . 
  and why not in the west . 
  for example greece can learn a lot from the way turkey is making tourism right now . 
  - resolve in amiable way the problems with the armenian and kurd minorities . 
  recognizing the armenian holocaust , it 's not an act of weakness , on the contrary it 's an act of courage and normality , that will increase the overall image in the long run . 
  - do n't get to involved in the israel - palestinian war , from a political/military perspective . 
  instead focus on humanitarian acts , and show the world that the values of islam are also about helping others , not imposing an unidirectional view ( backwards ) unto others . 
  - turkey should try to help as much as possible to help the neighboring syrian refugees , who are in desperate need of a peaceful environment where to live and raise their families . 
  well , i 've met a guy in france with turkish origins . 
  his parents where turks , but he was born in france , and french was his first language . 
  he was also a moderately muslim compared to his other colleagues ( from algeria mainly ) at my workplace who where criticizing him all the time for eating a snack in the middle of the day in ramadan , or drinking a beer with us , unbelievers . 
  their boss , even warned them a few times that they will suffer consequences if they do n't cut short the religious discussions at the workplace . 
  but one day he said he has the deepest admiration for the current prime-minister , that ataturk was not such a positive figure in the turkish history , and he started a rant about national pride , ottoman empire and how the west is becoming more and more decadent . 
  i was ` wtf ' . 
  so , i do n't know what this erdogan is saying , but it seems he is getting more and more support even from the well-integrated turkish diaspora . 
  i raise you the vowel only romanian phrase : `` oaia aia e a ei ? '', 
  ( that sheep is hers ) . 
  in 89 i was three . 
  i 've remember seeing the movies in the 90s . 
  i suppose they were cheaper than the hollywood action movies because the romanian television bought the series . 
  in the 90s we 've also had cable tv , and we had some channels from the west . 
  i remember rai uno having those along with bud spencer movies . 
  my father was kind enough to double them for me in real time ( he is quite good at french and italian ) . 
  i do n't think the movies were exported to the eastern block before 89 . 
  at least not in romania . 
  in a way he was my childhood hero . 
  when i was a kid , i would always leave anything else in order to watch a movie with him . 
  my favorite ` jandarm ' . 
  marea britanie / great britain or regatul unit / united kingdom ( sometimes in the news ) . 
  stockholm syndrome gone wild ... 
  okay , i did n't understand the context of your comment . 
  thanks for mentioning this fact . 
  meanwhile france is going to sell some warships to russia . 
  does it matter if americans where on board ? 
  people died . 
  white people , brown people , american people , dutch people . 
  people are easily to be fooled by putin 's propaganda . 
  but i hope that one day the people of the russian federation will understand that putin is the aggressor , not their friend . 
  a country so rich in culture , resources and `` scientific brains '' , should be rich and happy , not a gangster state , with unhappy people nostalgic of their former glory . 
  russia is the country of [ those people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_russian_people ) , not the country of stalin or putin . 
  russia of today = the mafioso gas station ... 
  this country can be much more than this . 
  `` russia '' is a broad term . 
  the scum is the mafia who controls this great nation . 
   mistakes do happen you are over simplifying the situation . 
  this is a shameful act , and the guilty persons are the ones who helped the illiterate rebels who call themselves `` separatists '' . 
  russia never learns . 
  he who pushed the button just killed 295 persons . 
  this is a shameful act . 
  what a tragedy !, 
  -- edit : 295, 
  dude you are slow ... 
  agree with that . 
  except that the `` old '' romanians do n't like russia . 
  it 's a picture with a flag ... do n't get upset if you are going to get downvoted . 
  people are expecting something else from reddit . 
  basically the romanians and the moldovians are the same people divided by a unfavorable history . 
  the republic of moldova is the bastard child of stalin and urss . 
  in romania there are some blonde gypsies : [ ex1 ] ( http://www.descopera.org/wp-content/uploads/tigani2.jpg ) [ ex2 ] ( http://assets.perfecte.ro/assets/perfecte/2012/06/29/image_galleries/16812/cea-mai-cunoscuta-fotografie-din-lume-are-acum-si-o-varianta-romaneasca-vezi-imaginea-care-a-emotionat_1.jpg ) etc. 
  sometimes the rich gypsy families ( the ones that were making jewels and had a lot of gold ) adopt blonde romanian children to `` improve '' their blood . 
  this thing was pretty common in the 90s after the fall of communism in regions like strehaia or hunedoara . 
  it was n't a mass phenomena , but it did happened . 
  those adopted children were raised as gypsies and no discrimination was made . 
  a beautiful blonde gypsy bride is worth a fortune ... 
  yes , gypsies are buying their future wives , and this indeed is a widespread phenomena . 
  if the bride has a light complexion is considered to be beautiful and the price is higher . 
  this is why rich gypsies ( that had gold ... kilos of gold ) are usually whiter than the rest . 
  because they have fair-skinned wives & mothers . 
  when europe wants to unite , some people want to create division . 
  this is the beauty of sharia . 
  soon europe , soon !, 
  it does n't really exist . 
  it 's not even a dialect . 
  it 's the same language with different accent ( and because of the separation - some archaisms are still in use ) . 
  mr. arnon grunberg should understand that the `` beauty of our weapons '' means something else , not a simple-minded propaganda article . 
  hmm , the east is better than the west ... ~ ~ at something ~ ~ at math . 
  thank you mother russia !, 
  do n't like them . 
  you can not convince me otherwise . 
  dude , do n't be pathetic . 
  russia \u221a turkey \u221a hungary \u221a with * russia * the antipathy remains , especially because rep. moldova ( basarabia ) , communism and now putin . 
  still we do n't share a common border ( as of march 2015 ) so they are somehow perceived as a stress from far way ( but getting closer and closer ) . 
  turkey is fine . 
  together with greece is one of the most popular destinations for holidays . 
  also the negative stereotypes about turks are slowly fading away from the mental collective . 
  hungary , not the most popular folks around the area . 
  modern romans burning roma cars with romanian numbers in rome . 
  is all about the `` rom '' here . 
  meanwhile islamic countries have a parallel declaration of human rights that is a bit different from what we know .
