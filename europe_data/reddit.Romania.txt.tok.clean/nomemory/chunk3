  actually , as a supporter of memri , i can say that you are a little bit biased yourself . 
  memri follows the most popular shows in the arab world , the type of show is aired on prime-time . 
  it also translates shows where progressive muslims participate , not only `` the worst '' type of extremists . 
  beer & bacon are more powerful than the words of the 7th century bedouin . 
  that 's one of the reasons europe needs immigrants . 
  we had a good laugh today at the office . 
  you should read some of the butthurt romanian comments to this news . 
  they are hilarious . 
  you can come to romania . 
  or like the other comments are saying any county in eastern europe . 
  education is cheaper here than in the western europe . 
  nuhu ribadu is a good example how a single man can make a difference . 
  our mafia is only known for being an expert in stealing from the average citizen . 
  we call our mafia , the parliament , and they assassinate only schools , hospitals , roads , things like that . 
  they usually stay away from killing stuff ( not saying codruta is a `` stuff '' ) . 
  you need to breed your own specimen !, 
  i am not sure she can adapt in different geographical regions . 
  we have ** [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laura_codru%c8%9ba_k%c3%b6vesi ) ** , the superwoman of prosecutors , has more balls than ** [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/v0hkpwc.jpg ) ** . 
  did you say crusades ? 
   christianity in sub-saharan africa is just as violent and disgusting as islam are you sure about that ? 
  i am not even christian , so i am not trying to pose as a christian advocate , but let 's be honest with ourselves . 
  i really do n't understand the ** superior atheist ** ( with bold ) mindset , that hates and criticize christianity with fervor , but somehow is ok with islam , because you know , crusades also happened . 
  every idiot is right a few times in his life . 
  this time orban is right . 
  guys , i do n't like mass immigration either , but this type of behavior really sucks . 
  yet, 
  good one , sir !, 
  basically you are saying banks are the best ? 
  what 's the connection between the random words you 've said and this video ? 
  we have lots of tits , bikinis and asses ( eg . 
  : [ www.wowbiz.ro ] ( http://www.wowbiz.ro/ ) ) . 
  that was not my intent . 
  nevertheless , ignore the immigrants and their issues , how does the system works in your country ? 
  i am pretty curious . 
  i know it 's more liberal compared with the other countries in the area , except maybe israel . 
  i know it 's quite diverse having significant druze and christian communities . 
  i want to visit it sometime , but not now . 
  there 's too much conflict and tension at the borders . 
  i 've just talked with them citizens . 
  they said `` ok '' . 
  some romtards here are quite annoying for us romanians , embarrassing us with their `` weird '' commentaries . 
  you have all the right to be offended , but do n't react bitterly , it 's not helping your cause . 
  yes you are right , many romanians try to distance themselves from slavs , which is a dumb thing . 
  but you must understand them . 
  this fascinations with the romans appeared in the xix when nations started to build their identities . 
  so the vlachs decided to call themselves romanians ( some sort of romans ) , they declared themselves children of rome and started to purge every slavic word from their vocabulary , like it was a plague . 
  this kind of mentality is still propagated by our educational system , our anti-russian feelings , and our fake glorious past . 
  but we are not the only balkan nation who suffer by this kind of disease . 
  are n't we ? 
  croats , macedonians , and more or less all the balkan nations have this cultural fairytale they live in . 
  i hope you are not serious . 
  please do n't embarrass us with this cringeworthy nationalistic propaganda . 
  do they wash or do they wipe in the north ? 
  i do n't support the idea . 
  `` please do n't steal my phone . 
  i will call the police . 
  they are going to punish you . 
  here , have a sit near me while the police comes ! '', 
  no , average people are expressing their feelings ( beyond political correctness ) . 
  yeah , we should always be polite : `` please do n't steal my phone . 
  here , take it for free , you deeply misunderstood minority ! '', 
  maybe you 're not into sarcasm . 
  glorious romanian empire will only accept those peasants as vassals . 
  romanian - native english and french - learned them at school . 
  my english is a little bit better , my french decent . 
  spanish - i had some private lessons ( when in high-school ) , also the language is easy to learn once you know two romance languages . 
  i can understand more , i find it difficult to express complex thoughts . 
  hebrew - private lessons . 
  self study . 
  family interaction . 
  know the alphabet , basic words , basic conversation . 
  if i watch the news i can understand some things given the context . 
  if i hear it on the street , without any context it 's hard for me to understand it . 
  this is not how i imagine the future of europe . 
  yes , i 've recently read a paper , it seems that romanian shares many similarities with the southern italian dialects : ( [ link ] ( https://www.academia.edu/10464761/romanian_and_the_gallo-italic_dialects ) ) . 
  people are downvoting him because people do not consider his comment as constructive ( myself included ) . 
  she did the equivalent of a poker all-in ... with her life , and the life of the child . 
  would you ever consider to come and live in europe ? 
  if yes , why and where . 
  [ here are all the funny answers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lt09ypt.png ) . 
  not bad europe , not bad  . 
  poor girl . 
  it 's dangerous to assume that if you are nice an treat people well , every body is like you . 
  i hope she will recover after this incident . 
  yeah , i 've seen the trend on / r/europe . 
  the sub-reddit became more racist than it was a few years ago . 
  myself i am also against immigration , but more because of cultural and socio-economic reasons , rather than `` genetics '' ... 
  yes , i know , but speaking with them ( i 've met some `` vlachs '' when i was in france ) i 've seen the language is the same as romanian ( with some archaism ) and we could understood each other , while romanian and aromanian are not quite mutually intelligible , i can only understand half of what they are saying if they speak slow . 
   misgenation is not necessarily bad . 
  it 's funny how they invented a new identity for the romanians , calling them vlachs . 
  romanian - mother tongue . 
  english and french - decently well . 
  i can understand quite well and talk little spanish . 
  to a lesser degree i can speak hebrew . 
  let 's say romania did n't allied itself with hitler ? 
  do you think that would 've dodged communism ? 
  because of britain we were a communist hellhole for half a decade . 
  funny fact , he is also a very rich socialist . 
  that 's actually his secret formula , each month he gives free meals to the poor in exchange for votes ... 
  some sort of a narcissistic kingpin at the shores of thr black sea .
