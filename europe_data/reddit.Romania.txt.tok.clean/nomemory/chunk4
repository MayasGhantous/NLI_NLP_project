  good luck britain , they all left to you !, 
  in romania they are too busy to steal from naive tourists , no time to think of uber . 
  i 've worked with a team of italians ... in belgium . 
  there 5 of them . 
  4 from the south , and one with parents from morocco ... 
  they told me it 's hard to find good software engineering jobs in italy . 
  russian is looking for unorthodox ( cough cough ) allies . 
  i think the media abuse the notion of `` right-wing '' . 
  i would n't exactly call hungary `` ripped apart '' . 
  the roma community lives in extreme poverty , and other than begging , and shop lifting they are pretty `` chill '' . 
  actually gypsies love life more than anything else . 
  so i guess that poverty and some other stuff in the mix is lethal . 
   hmm i wonder if terrorism correlates with any other variable ... say ... being poor and having nothing to lose . 
  romanians are pretty poor ... 
  hypothesis 1 :  what if they hate their families ? 
  hypothesis 2 :  if your brother is a killer , do you think is normal for you to go to jail because of his crimes ? 
   what about your mother ? 
  i actually enjoyed sofia better , maybe it was the exoticism of a city i did n't know . 
  bonus mountain near with a natural park . 
  not sure if kidding ...

  brothers in arms , so cute !, 
  hungarians our brothers lost in translation with that weird language of theirs !, 
  things were much better under the strong fist of the sultan !, 
  joking !, 
  the difference is quite small and quite irrelevant . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 've recently visited bulgaria and i 've felt very much at home . 
  the 10 years difference you are claiming is a little exaggerated . 
  we are in the same league at almost anything , maybe less corruption . 
  i do n't thing the differences are so big , there are certain areas where bulgaria is years ahead of romania , for example tourism , and certain areas where bulgaria is lacking . 
  what it bothers me , is the discourse , which is very superficial and dumb . 
  wtf , let 's compare to romania because we are so much better , and this comparison is relevant . 
  also we have no corruption , money just vanish . 
  the wheelchair guy has my respect . 
  what a hero !, 
  *  ** the bulgarian pm boiko borisov declared monday in a interview for nova tv that `` bulgaria has surpassed romania in all the fields , long time ago '' , reports focus information agency . 
  borisov was questioned by a reporter when is bulgaria going to catch up romania . 
  nu vad niciu bulgar care sa fuga in romania '' . 
  *  ** asked when and how bulgaria has surpassed the performances of their northern neighbor in the field of anti-corruption , borisov answered : **  ** their ministers steal and they were caught , while their president is looking for political asylum in moldova . 
  *  ** borisov said there are no convicted politicians in bulgaria , because probably , nobody is corrupt . 
   ** i consider that prevention is the most important , i know i am doing everything i can to stop them ( his colleagues ) from stealing , and they know that if i catch them , the must leave ** . 
  people from banat ( timi\u0219oara ) are quite arrogant . 
  they have a saying `` banatul este fruncea '' ( banat is the forehead , meaning they are the first \u00een everything ) . 
  if something bad happens in their region , they blame `` the immigrant '' , in our case , other romanians from poor areas from oltenia ( south ) or moldova ( east ) that are going to banat for work . 
  going in banat and telling them you are oltenian is like going to western europe and tell them you are romanian . 
  yes , especially if your job is related to it . 
  but as s person who worked from home for a year i would n't repeat the experience anytime soon . 
  after a year i was like a caveman craving for human interaction . 
  now , even though my company offers the possibility to work from home two days a week ( officially , because with management approval you can ask for more ) , i rarely use this opportunity . 
  i prefer staying at the office , eating lunch with real peoplea and smalltalking in coffee breaks . 
  but yes , in europe the remote jobs are becoming more and more popular . 
  it 's just that not everybody is suited for that . 
  or another version :  c\u00e2inii latr\u0103 , ursul ( l'ours ) trece . 
  \u021aigani ( \u021b is like zz pizza ) is zingani/zigani . 
  romanian is quite close to latin and in the same time italian . 
  but unfortunately mutual intelligibility is asymmetrical . 
  for a romanian it 's easier to understand italian than for an italian romanian . 
  `` language of sinti '' , not sure if random comparison ... 
  you have trolled them all . 
  hypotheses :  you work in the military forces . 
  your superior asks you to kill the enemy in a ** brutal ** way ( let 's say starvation ) . 
  if you do n't respect the orders you might get killed or suffer some unpleasant consequences . 
  if you respect the orders you get a promotion . 
   you , redditor , what would you do :  a ) refuse the order suffer the consequence  b ) get the promotion  ps : try to be sincere with yourselves and do n't project more morality than necessary on your character . 
  no if we extrapolate , we have a young illiterate country-boy called visinescu , that got a promotion , by respecting the orders of his superiors . 
  i do n't want to sound apologetic , but the situation has more shades of gray than 50 . 
  but i would n't call them full-scale wars . 
  mostly skirmishes from time to time . 
  dear moderator , can you please remove the troll ? 
  our first re-unification with them came after a period of strife , destruction and continuous wars between the main powers of europe at that time . 
  there is never a right moment . 
  i wanted to point out that not only the extreme right wish this . 
  i am not extreme right , and i support the re-unification . 
  there was a poll in romania concerning reunification and more than 70 % of the people interviewed said yes - they want that . 
  vlach magic . 
  moldovan language does n't exist . 
  is the same as romanian . 
  for political reasons ( pro-russia political parties ) they invented this language . 
  but every sane linguist know that the languages are identical . 
  also in moldova they use latin alphabet , but i am sure you 've used cyrillic letters only to troll 'n' trigger some romanians . 
  my favorite singer . 
  after listening blackstar and learning about his death i can now really understand what he was trying to tell . 
  [ blackstar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kszlwbac4sw ) was his epitaph . 
  i recommend you to re-listen it , and try to understand life and death the way the very sensitive david bowie did . 
   something happened on the day he died  spirit rose a metre and stepped aside  somebody else took his place , and bravely cried  ( i 'm a blackstar , i 'm a blackstar ) he was a star , now a black star . 
   i 'm the great i am ( i 'm a blackstar ) he was the great he is . 
  what if jew-oriented . 
  not all the orthodox christians are celebrating christmas now . 
  for example in romania the orthodox church celebrates the christmas on 25 december . 
  yes , it 's quite a versatile word : - capul familiei -  family 's head ( patriarch ) . 
  - in capul mesei -  in the `` extreme '' of the table ; - cu noaptea-n cap -  very early in the morning ( literally means `` with the night in the head '' ) ; - din cap p\u00e2n\u0103-n picioare -  from head to toe ; - b\u0103tut \u00een cap -  stupid person ( literally means `` beaten in the head '' ) . 
  - cu cap -  smart person ( literally means `` with head '' ) . 
  - a-i da de cap -  to succeed ( literally means `` to find the head '' ) ; - a-l duce capul -  to be smart ( literally means `` to head is leading him '' ) ; we have around 30 expression using `` cap '' , depending on the context this word can have multiple meanings : http://cumsescrie.ro/expresii-si-locutiuni-cu-cap/ . 
  in romanian the is the word 've \u0219ted ' ( veshted ) that is used to described dry leaves ( frunze ve\u0219tede ) or other things related to the dryness of nature in autumn . 
  interesting connection with albanian . 
  i am sure you would understand more when it 's written . 
  ** [ here ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugalia ) ** is the article in romanian about portugalia . 
  see , you understand romanian now . 
  home alone .
