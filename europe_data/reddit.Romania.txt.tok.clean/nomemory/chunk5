  they love vodka . 
  there is a big russian minority in moldova . 
  those are the ones who claim a different identity for moldavians . 
  but linguistically and history wise the moldavians are romanians . 
  in romania , we have a region called moldavia that was splitted by stalin in two . 
  one part remained part of romania and the other became a soviet , the one that 's now an independent state . 
  historically the capital of the whole region of moldavia is ia\u0219i , this city remained in romania . 
  after the soviet union collapse , in the nineties , there were some talks for reunification , but russia opposed . 
  ciolos is a hungarian name ? 
  it 's pronnounced as * tcholosch * . 
  moldovan is romanian spoken with a slavic accent . 
  there are n't any differences other than this . 
  no linguist considers them to be separate languages . 
  my teacher told , me better not , to use a , comma than using it , wrong . 
  first there is a cell , then there are two cells , and they divide uncontrollably into thousands of cells . 
  i beg your pardon . 
  as a trader i love qe because it always mean a weak currency . 
  if you 've started shorting eur/usd at 1.15 back when qe was announced , with a little leverage , now you would 've had have some nice profits . 
  it 's funny how polish people have a love and hate relationship with the gift stalin 's made . 
  no it does n't , because what you understand by innocent is different from what innocent means in islam . 
  ishmael is the father of arabs and he is he the first son of abraham . 
  i would n't call the cities outside transilvania less interesting . 
  i would say iasi ( in a way the cultural capital of romania , and the capital of moldova ) to have nice architecture . 
  even bucharest , was a beautiful city before beeing wiped by the communists . 
  but it 's true that the most cosmopolitan places are the most interesting . 
  for example timisoara is one of the best looking cities from romania . 
  this city had a mixed population : austrians , romanians , ungarians , serbians , jews , etc. 
  was expecting aziz . 
  muscalu - is another word for a russian-speaking person . 
  dunav\u0103\u021bu / dun\u0103reanu - related to the danube river . 
  cazacu - related to cossacks . 
  cern\u0103u\u021beanu - a name related to the currently ukrainian city of chernivtsi ( cern\u0103u\u021bi ) . 
  arn\u0103utu - albanian related . 
  putting some pressure is not that bad . 
  it 's hard to understand the corruption in eastern europe if you never experienced it . 
  the politicians in romania are just like nobles in the middle ages . 
  we call them * baroni locali * ( local barons ) . 
  they act like they are invincible and they have a defiant attitude toward the `` average citizen '' . 
   now what ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fptytaiife&amp;6&amp;t=38s ) . 
  i can relate with your feeling of not feeling ok in your shoes . 
  be whatever you want as long as you do n't hurt others with your actions . 
  coming from a very conservative society , in a way those images are disturbing for me . 
  to be honest , i am still struggling myself to accept homosexuality . 
  and i am not saying this in a critical way , or do i have a an agenda , it 's just the way i feel . 
  some part of me says it 's nothing wrong in this ( homosexual behavior/identity are way older than history itself - probably ) , and then , the conservative part takes control and whispers in my ear this is not an acceptable behavior . 
  i should meditate on that . 
  nice picture , with historical value . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  in romanian slang , `` a da muie '' would literally mean to `` fuck somebody in the mouth/fuck his face '' . 
  `` muie ponta '' would mean `` fuck you , ponta ( in the mouth ) '' . 
  ( '' [ muian ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/muian ) '' it 's the pejorative word for `` face '' , the * normal * word for `` face '' is `` fa\u0163\u0103 '' ) but romanians , are very nice , and they would never say that directly to their prime-minister . 
  so they switched the consonants in a way nobody would understand , '' ** p ** uie ** m ** onta '' . 
  there was a guy two weeks ago on the forex subreddit , telling people to buy and hold lira . 
  everybody was laughing at him . 
  shitposting must end . 
  shitposting should be banned . 
  amazing serbia !, 
  they do what they need to do to protect their way of life . 
  life is not easy when your neighbors are throwing rocks , rockets and babies at you , and when you fight back they yell : `` racists '' , `` aggressors '' , etc. 
  palestinians are not the best partners in negotiation , and the recent stabbings in israel are a proof of that . 
  now regarding the religious extremism . 
  israel is ruled by zionist movements/parties . 
  the religious extremists in israel , are usually against the zionist rule ( see neturei karta for example ) . 
  maybe they are the muslim scientists and scholars britain prides itself with . 
  they are hypocrites . 
  israel is the `` normal '' state in a region full of shit . 
  so instead of boycotting saudi arabia , or other fantastic human rights heaven , they boycott the only true democracy of the area . 
  italy . 
  love the climate , the nature and the italians . 
  made some money yesterday shorting eur/usd and buying stoxx europe 50 . 
  in the last few months every ecb meeting is bearish for eur . 
  i am wondering if this qe will work for europe as it worked for the us . 
  because youtube dude . 
  we are not that multicultural as other places . 
  i prefer living in a culturally homogeneous society . 
  i do n't mind to work with indians . 
  it 's hard for me to bond with them . 
  our cultures are quite alien to each other , and i prefer bonding with my own kind . 
  the moment i look for bulgaria in the list ... 
  how are the views towards france ? 
  positive/negative/neutral . 
  how anti-jewish is morocco compared to other arab nations . 
  also kids nowadays are pretty impressionable when it comes to leftist ideas , sjw bullshit , and other ideological products that are begging to be embraced . 
  the question now , are you a kid ? 
  it 's not such a big city . 
  it has a nice city center with different architectural styles , blending quite well . 
  a beautiful park . 
  some museums . 
  some old churches , some landmarks related to the romanian revolution . 
  a lot of bars where you can enjoy fat eastern european food and cheap beer . 
  in a way it 's like krakow . 
  you can go there for a city break and you wo n't be disappointed . 
  well that 's a gypsy ghetto right there ... 
  what 's the distinction between a kippah and very small hat . 
  on what grounds she will make the distinction . 
  this is a sad mockery , and no soldier should accept this ... 
  latin speakers can not into school . 
  this summer i 've bought myself a t-shirt with bulgaria ... 
  things are less hot than they used to be .
