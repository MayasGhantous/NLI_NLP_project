well , at least denmark 's acknowledging it . 
  that is pure art . 
  unfortunately , the really fat dinosaur is coming for us all . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 this is filmed in such a dramatic way . 
  it 's a goddamn fish people, 
  well this turned out better than expected, 
  australians you too ? 
  smh, 
   called romania no shit sherlock, 
  i think romania is ranked way too low . 
  edit : or maybe not . 
  idk anymore . 
  [ george enescu festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_enescu_festival ) - the george enescu festival ( also known as george enescu international festival and competition ) , held in honor of the celebrated romanian composer george enescu , is the biggest classical music festival and classical international competition held in romania and one of the biggest in eastern europe . 
  [ electric castle festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric_castle_festival ) other worth knowing romanian music festivals are : [ untold festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untold_festival ) and [ artmania festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artmania_festival ) . 
  you can find more music festivals [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_festivals_in_romania ) , along with film and theatre festivals . 
  not really a celebration or a festival , but it is worth knowing that romania holds the [ eastern european comic con ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_european_comic_con ) . 
  lol , i was n't complaining , but i take it you do n't understand humor and sarcasm . 
  and if i would complain , i would n't complain about us not being in eurovision , but rather about tvr being dicks . 
   #welcomeall do n't tease us, 
  last night , today and tomorrow , the romanian special police forces will patrol crowded places in bucharest . 
  they do n't exactly say why ( safety from what ? 
  ) , but it 's most probably because of the orthodox easter and in fear of possible terrorists threats because of this holiday . 
  this is a summary . 
  thanks !, 
  happy orthodox easter indeed !, 
  this is really good news . 
  yay !, 
  `` prospective members '' . 
  like that 's going to change . 
  it 's a nice flag . 
  i personally like it . 
  i see . . 
  so these are preventive actions , even if the numbers for finland and sweden 's stance ( `` sweden 's government has said it will not join the alliance , but four opposition parties want membership . '' ), 
  show reluctance to joining . 
  i just ca n't wait for the referendum so we can all move along . 
  everyone knows each side will promote both good arguments and bullshit along the way . 
  wait ... so neither the governments or the people of these countries want to join nato ? 
  is it out of fear ? 
  is it because they prefer their status right now ? 
  and if their governments/people do n't want to join nato , why is russia making such a big deal ? 
  i know russia feels defensive over recent nato actions , but this is a whole new level of paranoia . 
   though i guess we can just dress it up as us soldiers on vacation in romania , russia should know well as a leading provider of military vacationing . 
  you ca n't fool [ putin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laxr5zgpv68 ) my friend, 
  patriotism is okay , nationalism is n't . 
  some countries do frown upon nationalism , but nobody 's against anyone being a patriot . 
  this is exactly why i 'm against a reunification . 
  we already know about the high tensions between romania and russia and poland and russia . 
  nato is planning to strengthen our borders for this reason . 
  i fear a reunification with moldova would ignite more than just russia criticizing the action . 
  this is just how i see it though . 
  someone who 's more educated on the matter might see the situation differently . 
  that 's nasty , i feel so sorry for them : /, 
   we have no intention of withdrawing from nato . 
  maybe you wo n't , but i have a feeling trump only wants to deal with the western side of nato . 
  if something happens in east nato countries and us refuses to abide by article 5 because we have n't yet made the 2 % ( while there are western countries much richer than us who also did n't reach that ) we 'll hate us just as much as russia . 
   ussr 2.0 where are you from ? 
  if you 're from the west , i will puke, 
  the difference in attitudes between this guy kaczynski and romania is this : ** poland : ** nato will not protect us if a invasion happens ** romania : ** guys ? 
  you 'll protect us , wo n't you ? 
  right ? 
  * right ? 
  * then again , romania is one of the most nato militarized countries atm so i 'm not sure russia would try us . 
  someone also suggested that it would be hard for putin to control much bigger countries , like poland and romania , rather than the baltics . 
  i think westerners do n't understand that easterners are skeptical about nato intervention because of our past . 
  ww2 and all . 
  it 's more of a reflex because we count ourselves as less important to the western states than some of their other interests ( like maintaining peace ; for example , that dude that could become us sos saying he would n't risk nuclear war over estonia ) so we fear they wo n't act . 
  i think they will . 
  mostly because they 'd realize that russia , if it comes to invasion , is n't coming just for the eastern states . 
  it would still be fucked up if they do n't do it immediately and even if they do it immediately , it 'll still be pretty bloody . 
  there are a few big ifs in my comment , but i think it sums up the discussion . 
  lol, 
  which is sad . 
  romania and the baltics are starting to get cornered by our rusophille neighbours ... not that romania does n't have its nutjobs , but it seems that , for the moment , we are n't influenced by russia as some of our neighbours are . 
   igor dodon , the socialist candidate for president of the republic of moldova , would want romania 's history removed from the school curriculum and replaced with moldova 's history . 
   `` i will insist that the history of moldova should return to schools . 
  our children must know the truth . 
  there are many things in romanian history that are not accurate , '' dodon said during the presidential debate with pro-eu candidate maia sandu , reports local news.ro . 
   in return , sandu said that nothing good would come out if igor dodon starts to write the history . 
  `` he will take care of history and will not have time to fight the oligarchs , to focus on pension , corruption , the economy , his priority is to write history textbooks . ''  in her opinion , the scientists should deal with history , not the politicians . 
   `` politicians should not interfere in it , or maybe , one day , we 'll find ourselves in the situation in which the politics dictates how mr. dodon 's biography will be written in books . ''  the people of moldova will elect their next president on sunday . 
  bulgaria , w r u doing ????? 
  we were supposed to be together in this goddamn it, 
  make sure your politicians know that it upsets you . 
  anti nato people are far more vocal . 
  it was the same with brexit . 
  it 's in us ' interest that europe does n't lose to russia . 
  you may think putin 's on your side , that he really wants to be friends with trump , but you are sorely mistaken . 
  and if you opt out of nato , russia will not say `` hey , they do n't want to be our enemies anymore . 
  we will be best friends now . '' . 
  russia will pursue and pursue until they 're on your doorstep . 
  they 'll solve their economical problems too . 
  keep this in mind . 
  it might not happen tomorrow , but it 's not light years away either . 
  to be honest , both romanian and polish people were bullied by xenophobic brexit supporters . 
  but yeah , there are many nationalities in uk that have higher numbers than us and we 're still among the ones that are the most bashed . 
  i 'm not going to deny that there are shady romanians ( whether they 're romani people or not ) , but it was always a surprise to me that people who have access to education would choose to focus on the small criminal minority ( romani or not ) to define not only the romanian diaspora but the country itself . 
  yeah ... tabloids from uk have a tendency to portray us in the worst possible way . 
  yay :d, 
  i appreciate uk 's culture . 
  it has a rich culture that has contributed a lot to the world .
