  idk who is this religious leader you 're mentioning . 
  do the military have any plans ? 
  how will this turn out ? 
  the people will come out in the street now , it 'll be even more complicated and dangerous . 
  that 's the thing . 
  i read istanbul and ankara are happy with it , but there are parts of the country who are n't so secular or want to be so secular . 
  they just said the security will fight back even if that means losing civilians lives, 
  they 've showed a bit of that here too . 
  how do the people feel ? 
  is social media still down ? 
  it 's happening . 
  they just said on tv that due to the coup , greece has put its military on alert . 
  yes , they said that on tv here too . 
  holy shit edit : they also said that greece put their military on alert due to the coup, 
  i wonder how turkey 's population feels about it . . 
  i heard on tv about shots fired in ankara and a state emergency . 
  and now they 're saying istanbul too . 
  what is exactly happening ? 
  edit : a terrorist attack and a possible coup ? 
  these two days have been absolutely insane . 
  all they said on romanian tv was that there were shots heard in ankara . 
  they 'll update the news i guess . 
  except when you have fists and the enemy has guns and is being funded by rich people , 
  they 're just showing a rerun of the celebration and they 're saying `` and hollande made the announcement everyone was waiting for : the state of emergency will be lifted soon . '', 
  and now this piece of shit comes and takes innocent lives in the name of hate and makes france an unstable country once again . 
  it is truly sickening and heart breaking . 
  they just said on tv that there are 60 dead , but its not official , they said . 
  this is just so fucked up , i do n't have words for it anymore . 
  i pray the injured people will survive this horrible thing !, 
  yeah , i 've seen it after and heard about it after . 
  sorry , i get very nervous when these things happen and i have my tv on and they 're reporting on it . 
  how did the truck get past the security ? 
  are n't the roads around blocked when there 's events on the national day ? 
  this is so fucked up . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  stay strong , france !, 
  well , better than the bible belt you 're welcome, 
  unless it 's something offensive to iliescu , i better not hear it, 
  can you tell me what he 's saying ? 
  i 've turned my speakers up but ca n't hear a damn thing cause they 're old and shitty, 
  has n't offended romania ? 
  nigel sure has, 
  i know people say there are idiots who do this everywhere , but there has been a surge in post brexit uk . 
  hopefully the police do their jobs right . 
  consider this : eastern european people and other minorities are people too . 
  they have kids that do n't understand what 's exactly happening . 
  you would n't like someone shouting at you to go back home , let alone burn your store down or receive cards with `` polish vermin '' written on them . 
  edit : why are you downvoting ? 
  is it that anything remotely negative about your country has to be put down ? 
  i said that there have been incidents , that these incidents suck for minorities and their children and that i hope the police do their best to stop the people who make these incidents happen . 
  there is no reason for you to downvote, 
   we were just foolin around and things just happened  so best friends with best benefits ? 
  joke 's on them , 
  * reads * ** poor ** * okay here we go it was expected * * continues reading * ** brothers ** * wipes tear *, 
  * parks white van in slovenia * heard you were talking shit about me, 
  `` definitely not catholic '' lol ~ ~ someone make one for romania too ~ ~, 
  yeah i imagined it is n't us . 
  i do n't think there 's much antipathy between our countries . 
  careful there / u/cheekycheetah or you 'll be drained of blood . 
  or money . 
  well now i 'm curious :(, 
  belarus got owned , ukraine is one big brothel with chicks from russia , moldova is the new middle east and bulgaria is mentally unstable, 
  yep , sorry, 
  my bad then . 
  i have a dream, 
  dude what ? 
   there are officially about 500,000 romani in turkey . 
  just you wait until the roles reverse and the baltics , the balkans and poland become the economic powers . 
  [ do n't worry germany , we 're the first on the list probably ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-zczm5qpec/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  reminds me a bit of florida, 
  well , a lot of fucked up things . 
  like ... rape . 
  the poor services for pregnant women were at fault too , were n't they ? 
  i guess what our state had to offer to pregnant women beats the faith in our lord and savior . 
  weird vaslui is lower than other regions , since we all know what happens there, 
  my bad . 
  must have not paid attention . 
  i can understand that . 
  seeing as i 'm not much of an expert , reading what you and other people have said here , is disheartening . 
  it 's good i 've shared the article though . 
  now i learned that this is quite fucked up . 
  that is absolutely adorable !, 
  thanks for sharing this !, 
  1 . a lot of people who do n't know much about the topic of restoring a historical sight 2 . i honestly have n't seen any news about it . 
  maybe someone else did because i 'm not 24/7 in front of tv , but i 've just recently heard of it, 
  that 's definitely a good idea too and you do have a point . 
  unfortunately , it has all been decided already . 
  honestly , i do n't know much about these things so i really ca n't comment . 
  but it 's good to see other perspectives on the matter . 
  what ? 
  also this :  half of the estimated 270,000 to 320,000 jews living in bessarabia , bukovina , and the former dorohoi county in romania were murdered between june 1941 and the spring of 1944 . 
  after a wave of random initial killings , jews in moldavia were subject to pogroms , while those in bessarabia , bukovina and dorohoi were concentrated into ghettos from which they were deported to concentration camps in the transnistria governorate , including camps built and run by romanians . 
  romanian soldiers also worked with the german einsatzkommando to massacre jews in conquered territories east of the romania 's 1940 border . 
  the total number of deaths is not certain , but even the lowest respectable estimates run to about 250,000 jews ( plus 25,000 deported romani , of which half perished ) . 
  at the same time , 120,000 northern transylvanian jews were deported to auschwitz by hungary and died in concentration and extermination camps . 
  also , antonescu 's government made plans for mass deportations from the regat ( historic moldo-wallachia ) to belzec , but never carried them out . 
  actually i 've read something about this on wiki so i 'll share :  after romania entered the war at the start of operation barbarossa atrocities against the jews became common , starting with the ia\u0219i pogrom - on june 27 , 1941 , romanian dictator ion antonescu telephoned col. constantin lupu , commander of the ia\u0219i garrison , telling him formally to `` cleanse ia\u0219i of its jewish population '' , though plans for the pogrom had been laid even earlier - 13,266 jews , according to romanian authorities , were killed in july 1941 . and  in 1941 , following the advancing romanian army during operation barbarossa , and , according to antonescu propaganda , alleged attacks by jews ( resistance groups of soviet partisans - for antonescu , all jews were communists , see odessa massacre ) , antonescu ordered the deportation to transnistria , of all jews of bessarabia and bukovina ( between 130,000 and 145,000 ) , who were considered en masse `` communist agents '' by the official propaganda . 
  `` deportation '' however was a euphemism , as part of the process involved mass killing of jews before deporting the rest in the `` trains of death '' ( in reality long exhausting marches on foot ) to the east . 
  of those who escaped the initial ethnic cleansing in bukovina and bessarabia , only very few managed to survive `` trains '' and the concentration camps set up in the transnistria governorate . 
  further killings perpetrated by antonescu 's death squads ( documents prove his direct orders ) targeted the jewish population that the romanian army managed to round up when occupying transnistria .
