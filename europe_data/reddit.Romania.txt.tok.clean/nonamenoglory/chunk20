  `` one of the things i love about eastern european folklore and folk magic is the completely blas\u00e9 assumption that there are vampires everywhere . 
  it 's not even `` here 's how to get rid of vampires '' - it 's more like `` here 's how to exploit your vampire problem for personal gain '' , or even `` here 's how to live with the fact that your neighbour is probably a vampire '' . 
  sure , everybody knows that old vladislaus and his wife are blood-sucking abominations ... but , well , come harvest time , you need every pair of hands you can get . 
  so just smile and nod , hang fresh garlic in your windows every new moon , and try not to think too hard about what they 're using to fertilise those strangely vigorous crops . '', 
  yes , it is . 
  i think i 've got it all confused because they labeled a left wing party as a right wing party . 
  i 'll clarify . 
  hope this makes sense . 
  i swear i 'm not an idiot . 
  hahaha . 
  social democratic party - left national liberal party - center right national union for the progress of romania - center left alliance of liberals and democrats - center right people 's party ( which no longer exists and the article says it 's right wing ) - left great romania party - far right, 
  edit : got confused by something in the article , thought i wrote it correctly , fixed the initial post now . 
  i 'll go hit my head against a wall . 
  i think it 's a good thing . 
  our premier , dacian ciolo\u0219 , is surely better than what we 've had before . 
  having a technocrat government means they 'll focus more on solving an issue rather than fighting with a opposing party , like it happens when the liberals or the social democrats are in power . 
  it wo n't last though . 
  the parliamentary elections are this year and whichever party wins , chooses the new premier . 
  a lot of people are asking if it 's possible for ciolo\u0219 to enter politics and remain the premier because he 's been good for us , but he has said from the very beginning that he does n't want to get involved in politics . 
  edit : got confused by something in the article , thought i wrote it correctly , fixed the initial post now . 
  i 'll go hit my head against a wall . 
   the current government is led by dacian ciolo\u0219 , who was appointed prime minister of romania on 10 november 2015 , after the resignation of victor ponta amid mass protests against generalised corruption linked to club colectiv tragedy . 
  it consists of 21 ministers . 
  no member of the cabinet is politically affiliated , ciolo\u0219 government becoming the first entirely technocrat cabinet in romanian history . 
  the left wing does n't actually have much popularity here anymore because it 's full of corruption and associated with communism . 
  the only remaining far right party is greater romania party , but they do n't have any seats in the parliament at the moment and they generally have under 10-15 % votes . 
  the people 's party dissolved in 2015 . 
  left parties in romania ( like psd - social democrats ) do n't do well lately either ( again , because corruption ) and most people i know want them gone from the parliament . 
  currently , these are the number of seats per each party in the parliament , but there will be elections soon : social democratic party ( left ) - 144 national liberal party ( center right ) - 118 national union for the progress of romania ( center left ) - 27 alliance of liberals and democrats ( center right ) - 23 democratic union of hungarians in romania - 17 unaffiliated - 32 ** edit : ** fixed fucked up post . 
  `` outsiders '' should n't be able to influence the vote , but everyone can have an opinion . 
  our president , klaus iohannis , said that the uk should stay in ue . 
  this is not a quote as i 've seen this on tv at some point and ca n't remember the actual words . 
  ^ this ^ is ^ not ^ an ^ invitation ^ to ^ mock ^ my ^ country ^ as ^ to ^ why ^ the ^ president ^ wants ^ uk ^ to ^ stay . 
  ^ i 'm ^ just ^ answering ^ the ^ question . 
  is romania doing good ? 
  what a conspiracy !, 
  surely it must be at the expense of other countries . 
  well , it 's not like our media would n't pick up on comments like that . 
  when will this bullshit end ? 
  ca n't we just agree that basic human rights are not to be voted on ? 
  that they should be guaranteed by the state ? 
  why are people in this country so concerned with other people 's lives ? 
  live and let live , you idiots !, 
  i ca n't seem to find a price online for 600g , but i found for : 400g - 2.73 euros . 
  750g - 4.22 euros . 
  searched online because i do n't remember the store prices , but i do n't think they 're different . 
   oooh , that 's a bingo !, 
  is that the way you say it ? 
  `` that 's a bingo ? '', 
  i think they 'll remain in eu , but it 'll be a close call . 
  * if * the baltic states are attacked and no one in nato does anything , everyone else will step out of nato , or at least eastern europe ( because it 'll be the same thing in or out ) and russia would gain influence here once again . 
  i know a few countries who would n't let that happen . 
  not because they care very much about people in eastern europe , but they * do * care about their influence and stability . 
  russia has no chill . 
  thank you !, 
  this is probably ignorant of me , but can someone explain me what is this ? 
  i do n't know what it is about and i do n't know how to search for information either . 
  ah , yes , i totally see your point . 
  i just tried to base my answer on media + what i heard around me , but i 'm from bucharest so it 's obviously a quite subjective perspective . 
  i do n't think there are any statistics yet . 
  it 's funny when you think about it . 
  if you 're from , say , france , and putin would say `` france needs to chill or there will be consequences . '', 
  ( like he did with northern europe ) or the russian press would write `` yeah , your country might be left in ruins because you dared put an anti missile shield in your country . 
  '' , shit would go down , but here , in eastern europe , russia threatening your country is just weekly news . 
  lol . 
  okay , i may have exaggerated a bit , but i hope you get my point . 
  why are you not sure about the rest ? 
  putin definitely takes the first place . 
  he 's always been in our news a lot and most romanians know him . 
  obama has n't been a lot in the news recently , except for making anti brexit statements , but people do know him . 
  orban 's always up to something crazy and our news usually report on him . 
  the fence especially brought him to our attention even more . 
  merkel is recently known for the refugee crisis and let 's not forget that even the opposition 's fans are like `` of course iohannis won . 
  he has merkel 's support . '' . 
  i should have probably changed erdogan with cameron though . 
  hollande is n't as known , maybe i should n't have put him there . 
  he was in the center of attention during the paris attacks . 
  who do you think are the most famous leaders ? 
  i ca n't talk for the general public without statistics , but i can talk about who * i * think are the most famous for the general public in romania . 
  putin , obama , orban ( i could add trump , but he 's not a leader . ), 
  hollande , erdogan, 
  i remember my french teacher . 
  i 'm sure she wanted to murder me . 
  you do n't fuck with french teachers . 
  well , we kind of call netherlands - olanda ( holland ) . 
  also , switzerland is `` elve\u0163ia '' . 
  edit : wales - \u0162ara galilor, 
  we use them for proper nouns only too . 
  and of course , the beginning of a sentence/phrase . 
  uk or germany . 
  so much to see !, 
  also , netherlands or denmark . 
  spain and italy could also be very nice . 
  i ca n't choose . 
  how the hell ? 
   klaus werner iohannis ( romanian : [ \u02c8kla.us jo\u02c8hanis ] ( listen ) , german : [ \u02c8kla\u028a\u032fs jo\u02c8han\u026as ] ; also spelled johannis  edit : oh wait ...  klaus is a german given name and surname . 
  it originated as a short form of nikolaus , a german form of the greek given name nicholas . 
  i wonder what 's like to be from the sweden/norway/finland / germany/etc . 
  when this kind of map shows up . 
  i 'd definitely be alright with france too .
