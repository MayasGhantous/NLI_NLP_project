  that 's hungarian . 
   also , i thought you had euros already . 
  nope . 
   also , what 's with all the moustaches ? 
  no idea . 
   also , what 's with the language ? 
  is it slavic , spanish , what is going on ? 
  it 's romanian , you 're in romania . 
  it 's a romance language , just like spanish . 
  it 's not slavic , it 's a romance languange . 
  same for romania ... 
  if it 'll ever participate again . 
   please now that is over , can this unfunny joke be replaced with the normal map , so we russians and europeans have our country fully represented in this sub like all others do ? 
  you lost to australia . 
  australia claims your clay now . 
  so it 's not something that just happens in romania . 
  when i saw on the news that they buried pig corpses in the ground meant for the mosque , i was thinking `` goddamn , we have a whole new level of lunatics out there . 
  '' , but it seems it does n't happen just here . 
  it 's still a shitty , silly move imo . 
  lololol my favorites were `` how western europe sees eastern europe '' and `` how continental europe sees the uk '' . 
   far right minority ; it 's too small to mention , though i 'm actually concerned as to why organizations like noua dreapta are still allowed to function in a state with [ laws ] ( http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/legea_217_2015_modificare_oug_31_2002_interzicere_organizatii_simboluri_caracter_fascist_rasist_xenofob_promovare_cultul_persoanelor_vinovate_infractiuni_contra_pacii_omenirii.php ) against legionnairism , fascism , racism , xenophobia , etc. 
  actually , yes . 
  there 's a legionary organization named '' [ noua dreapt\u0103 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noua_dreapt%c4%83 ) '' ( the new right ) . 
   considering themselves the heir apparent to the iron guard , noua dreapt\u0103 embraces legionnairism and has a personality cult for corneliu codreanu but they also use the celtic cross , which is not associated with legionnairism . 
  well , [ he ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_antonescu ) was appointed as a prime minister , but because our king back then was young ( king michael i was 19 ) , he easily seized the power and declared himself as `` conduc\u0103tor '' ( in a sense similar to fuhrer ) . 
  he was very loyal to the nazi cause and to hitler . 
  he had his own holocaust in romania : [ ia\u015fi pogrom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ia%c8%99i_pogrom ) . 
  eventually , the king , though young , had to do something . 
  he staged a coup d'etat with the persecuted opposition and arrested antonescu . 
  hitler was very mad because of this and bucharest was bombed . 
  apparently , [ because he was mad at what the king did to antonescu ] ( https://youtu.be/-sslxgfeuum?t=1629 ) , hitler tried to bomb the places where michael i was known to stay . 
  antonescu was eventually executed . 
  besides ceausescu , there was also ion antonescu , a good friend of hitler , [ with whom hitler was actually a bit fascinated ] ( https://youtu.be/-sslxgfeuum?t=609 ) , but i have a feeling you already know about him . 
  i hope for bernie too , but it 's unlikely . 
  arctic monkeys - english within temptation - dutch him - finnish are these world famous ? 
  i have no idea . 
  i also have weird music taste probably . 
  yes , hopefully we 'll achieve it all . 
  i know it takes time and i know there 's got ta be patience on our side too . 
  thank you for the kind words !, 
  nice try , but if you ai n't got good food , we ai n't making a sitcom . 
  i was looking at your history , but i 'm too lazy to go through it all to see if you 've ever posted in / r/romania or you go under a false flag . 
  and no , i do n't think that , not at all . 
  you 're either a troll under a false flag or you just have a terrible nihilistic view of your own country which is quite ignorant . 
  well then , what 's stopping you from moving away and getting a different citizenship ? 
  if things are that bad , you 'd surely would n't want to be in this * shithole * . 
  totally agree . 
  it 's obviously ignorant . 
  and it 's not like it 's difficult to find out the facts . 
  but what can we do ? 
  it also really sucks when we * visit * western countries and * some * people make a face if they ask us where we 're from and we tell them . 
  they would n't be able to guess otherwise , but say where you 're from and suddenly they 're like `` yikes '' . 
  it is n't like we 're actively sending them out of our country on a criminal mission . 
  we ca n't block people from leaving either , eu would definitely react . 
  you see , that 's the thing , there 's no winning . 
  it ai n't worth having a discussion with someone who is a google search away from not being a ignorant , but refuses to educate themselves . 
  i did n't expect us to be in that position ... 
  i mean , i know eu/europe hates us , but that 's a new low . 
  i might be mistaken , but as for your linguistic skills ... wow !, 
  keep up the good work !, 
  it started with cartoons . 
  in 1998 , cartoon network became available on television , but it was only in english . 
  i did n't understand much , but my mother would translate for me sometimes . 
  i started learning words and short sentences . 
  it was also taught in kindergarten . 
  i loved the language so it was fairly easy after that . 
  my english is far from the best though . 
   a russian commentator , konstantin bogdanov , wrote on lenta.ru , a news portal , that the antimissile sites in eastern europe might even accelerate the slippery slope to nuclear war in a crisis . 
   they would inevitably become priority targets in the event of nuclear war , possibly even targets for preventive strikes . 
  countries like romania that host american antimissile systems might be the only casualties , he wrote , whereas the united states would then reconcile with russia `` over the smoking ruins of the east european elements of the missile defense system . '' oh well ... 
  i can only remember so much . 
  i 'm just a ~ ~ human ~ ~ vampire after all . 
  romanians are poor gypsy communist vampires who are going to overtake uk 's glorious clay . 
  update kremlin 's reaction : `` we have been saying right from when this story started that our experts are convinced that the deployment of the abm system poses a certain threat to the russian federation , '' presidential spokesman dmitry peskov said on thursday . 
  `` measures are being taken to ensure the necessary level of security for russia . 
  the president himself ( vladimir putin ) , let me remind you , has repeatedly asked who the system will work against ? 
  `` it is part of the military and political containment of russia , '' said andrey kelin , a senior russian foreign ministry . 
  i think op means that they should just say it 's because of russia and not bullshit . 
  i 'm all for defending our borders , but they are clearly against russia and not iran . 
  to be honest , it 's bullshit . 
  so putin 's reaction [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ux3oiweliq ) is actually the only normal reaction . 
  i do n't know how the interviewer can say it with a straight face . 
  i 'm not saying we do n't need to be cautious , but at least tell it like it is . 
  it was yesterday , but thanks for posting !, 
  unfortunately , he 's very old and very ill . 
  i wish him the best though . 
  this is the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_i_of_romania ) with more information . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk7npwm2qgs ) is a new documentary about him . 
  it does n't have that much english , but i thought i 'd post it anyway . 
  the king speaks english in it though . 
  it 's about how he was left at the helm of the country at the age of 19 . 
  since he was very young , the power was eventually seized by the general ion antonescu who was supporting the nazi cause ( and who even declared war without informing the king ) . 
  then , when the communists took over , they forced him to abdicate . 
  he was also sent into exile . 
  long live the king !, 
  from yesterday in the romanian press : serghei karakaiev said that because us continues to better their missile shields , especially because they 're working on european grounds , russia wants to make intercontinental missiles that could penetrate those shields . 
  maria zaharova has said before that putting mk41s in romania defies the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty . 
  the american missile defense agency has said that there will be 44 missiles at the deveselu base in romania and they 've allocated 550 million dollars to establish them . 
  sorry for the bad english . 
  i rarely drink coffee .
