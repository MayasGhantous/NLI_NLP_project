  especially since i 'm a forgetful person . 
  i still keep it around but i do n't have much to do with it anymore . 
  i 've given up on reporting anything on facebook . 
  it just does n't work . 
  goddamn it . 
  the longest i 've been on a train was 10 hours and it was pretty awful . 
  i do n't know how i 'd resist longer than that . 
  is n't it weird that from bucharest to budapest it takes almost 14h and from paris to rome , which is way longer , it takes only 11h ? 
  you 're lying . 
  that 's what we call it when someone presents something as a fact with no sources to prove it . 
  the rest of the country is not a mess . 
  czechia and czech republic are both correct . 
  czech republic is widely used in english , but in romania we 've been calling them cehia ( czechia ) all along . 
  republica ceh\u0103 ( czech republic ) is usually used when talks are more formal . 
  i do n't think i 've heard of czechland though . 
  - chocolate . 
  - brussels or bruxelles is known as the heart of the european union . 
  - they 're a federal state . 
  - wallonia opposed ceta because of some concerns with their farmers . 
  - france jokes about them . 
  - stella artois is a belgian beer . 
  - famous for their waffles . 
  romania does n't equal bulgaria , but i imagine bulgaria ca n't be as bad as you say . 
  watched a few european movies about wwii .

  romania 's economy grew with 75 % so i doubt bulgaria could be poorer than ever . 
  and behind the holy roman empire . 
  yah , but there 's no hard feelings right brolgaria ? 
  why would you fight us ? 
  we 're bros. :'), 
  23 languages excluding immigrant languages which are , according to the source , chinese ( 2,270 ) , croatian ( 6,360 ) , russian ( 29,200 ) , tatar ( 21,300 ) . 
   the number of individual languages listed for romania is 23 . 
  all are living languages . 
  of these , 5 are indigenous and 18 are non-indigenous . 
  furthermore , 2 are institutional , 19 are developing , 1 is vigorous , and 1 is in trouble . 
  unfortunately , i could not access the report because it 's been mistaken for the one about honduras . 
  edit : [ found it .

  * getting laid * ? 
  lol, 
  i do n't know ... maybe netherlands ? 
  france ? 
  there are possibillities . 
  does n't mean it will happen . 
  i do sure hope it wo n't . 
  no one leaves , right wing chills , eu gets some stability . 
  a good perspective . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  narator : * and then it got worse ... *, 
  venezuela collapsing might actually happen . 
  can you explain usa/china though ? 
  more like we do n't come up with any plan at all so we barely ask for it . 
  yeah could be more accurate, 
   baltic countries get additional colouring to mark that there 're some ethnic minorities , while the rest of the countries do not . 
  look at romania, 
  not to contradict that you 're a net giver , but romania is quite a poor net receiver . 
  eu is actually complaining about the money we do n't take . 
  #happy new year everyone !, 
  despite my pessimism , i hope 2017 will be a great year !, 
  it is awesome having a community where you can discuss interesting things with people from all over !, 
  and let 's not forget the funny banter !, 
  thank you , mods , for keeping this place cool !, 
  brolgaria ... brolgaria please ... 
  this is madness !, 
  yes , i was talking about this poll . 
  i mean we usually tell each other `` do n't be bothered , do n't be bothered !, 
  '' , but i remember that when i saw this poll specifically i was pretty :( . 
  you 're absolutely right about this . 
  hopefully we can keep going on this path , even with some obstacles . 
  way to go poland !, 
  i think it 's a quite brotherly thing . 
  like even if bulgaria does better in a poll , i 'm like `` oh well , time to give them the good spotlight ! '' . 
  i have no bad sentiments over bulgaria . 
  we had some good progress . 
  i only wish that one day we will be able to reach a level where we 're still not regarded as `` the worst '' . 
  i remember a poll showing that europeans like russia and china better than romania . 
  lol, 
  will the salt ever disappear ? 
  uk supported this expansion . 
  poor ukraine . 
  have fun in limbo ! ~  in case of brexit cut here i love this one hahaha, 
  did you hear murica ? 
  you 're getting a new state !, 
  that 's bran castle . 
  [ peles castle ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=peles+castle&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=770&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewid8s721zzrahulliwkhezabgqq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=castelul+peles ) is really cool . 
  ~ ~ do n't mind me i 'm just helping our economy but srsly it 's cool so go visit ~ ~, 
  after years of strong propaganda , brain washing and fear mongering ? 
  think again . 
  some of the romanian people also knew to an extent , especially those who lived next to jews or gypsies , but they knew less than the germans because the process of getting rid of the jews and the gypsies was n't as public or as systematic as in germany . 
  they knew . 
  even germans will tell you that they knew . 
  more [ info ] ( https://www.quora.com/nazi-germany-to-what-extent-were-average-german-citizens-aware-of-or-involved-in-the-holocaust ) here . 
  but they did . 
  there 's evidence today that they knew exactly what was going on . 
  someone make an offensive cartoon about them then . 
  lol then again , i do n't know what would happen if another country made a cartoon about dead french or germans killed by terrorists . 
  would people still say `` ah , do n't get butthurt . 
  it 's just a cartoon . '' ? 
  ever since the ch incident i said that while i agree with freedom of speech , i do n't like what they do . 
  i was almost called a terrorist sympathizer by one of my teachers .
