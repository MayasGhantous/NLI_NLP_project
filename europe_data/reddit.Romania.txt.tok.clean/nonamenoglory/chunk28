  i was in uni back then . 
  is this the real life ? 
  is this just fantasy ? 
  so you say the only way is anschluss way ? 
  * smirk *, 
   who deserves the noose careful there . 
  your russian is showing but seriously now . 
  that was very uncalled for . 
  i may not be a unionist , but you 're crossing the line there buddy . 
  would you look at that black hole ... 
   the us did n't rebuild germany after wwii though they were part of the allies that actually helped germany after wwii with money and resources . 
   germany does n't owe shit to the us , we 're even . 
  if there 's someone who does n't owe shit to the us in europe , it 's ee . 
  we never had help from them , they 've bombed my country in wwii , but did n't give us any money or resources postwar , unlike with germany . 
  and they 've only started helping us with russia 2 years ago or so . 
  you 're delusional . 
  even with being very close to dragnea and doing everything she 's told , no one would move their asses and protest the fact that she 's muslim or that she 's a woman . 
  it 's her husband 's shady business that makes her unacceptable . 
  there are people who dislike that she 's muslim or a woman , most among psd and pru fans , but they would n't have gone out to protest her either . 
  it 's rise project ffs ... 
  this . 
  i 've mentioned it before :  i think he did the right thing , but he should have talked more about why he rejected her . 
  the main problem , politically , was never about her being a muslim or a woman ( although some psd voters have a problem with that ) , but about her being put there because dragnea knows she 'll do as she 's told ( which is why he said he would n't let any other party member be nominated ) and her syrian husband who worked for the assad regime , publicly supports assad on facebook and is suspected to have ties with hezbollah . 
  # :( ~ ~ ^ 2016 ^ you ^ sick ^ bastard ~ ~, 
  europe still better than everyone else . 
   romania 19 % nice !, 
  i think he did the right thing , but he should have talked more about why he rejected her .

  we do n't need a fence . 
  the majority of romanians do n't love russians . 
  they 've annexed our territory and created a country out of it , they 've pumped anti romanian propaganda in that country , they 've stolen our treasury ( spain 's too ) of * tones * of gold and have only ever given back 30 or so * kilograms * of it , they 're violating human rights , they 're sending us official videos that tell us to `` learn our true history '' , they are threatening us and annexing our neighbour 's lands . 
  i try to sympathize with the russian people , but it is time to realize that they 're actively choosing leaders that not only hurt their country , but other countries too . 
  and our treasury ? 
  and them going back to soviet style annexations ? 
  and them actively threatening us often enough ? 
  yeah , that was certainly something stupid to say of him . 
  * people were beaten and killed , but it was n't that bad ... * give me a break . 
   the main reason eastern europe isnt as wealthy as western europe is because of the failed communist central planning policies of the ussr . 
  capitalism is n't perfect but communism is much worse and not the answer . 
  yes , exactly . 
   oh but real communism has n't been tried !, 
  makes me so angry . 
  especially when it comes from people who 's country has never endured communism . 
   maybe romania oh , it was certainly bad . 
  from the decimation of our intellectual elites to the brutality of ceausescu 's last years as a leader , when he was paying off the country 's debts at the expense of the citizens . 
  after the war , communism sank my country while the others developed and bloomed under democracy and with the help of the allies . 
  communism has left behind corruption and nepotism , not just for the leaders but for the people too . 
  being behind the iron curtain for almost 50 years was an ugly thing that served us nothing . 
  the worst thing is that after the revolution , which has been proved to be more of a coup , after so many lost their lives , the neocommunists came to power and it dragged us down even more . 
  like our former president ion iliescu , currently indicted for crimes against humanity during the mineriad ( 1990 ) . 
  exactly . 
  and they 've been threatening us for the past two years a lot . 
  the way i see it , the % of people who view russia positively can not pass 30 . 
  like / u/lowenmeister pointed , a [ 2014 statistic from gallup ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/182795/russia-receives-lowest-approval-world-highest.aspx?g_source=position3&amp;g_medium=related&amp;g_campaign=tiles ) shows that the percent was 15 % . 
  you can not go from 15 % to 53 % , especially since there was no event to put russia in a good light . 
  which clearly shows that there could be something wrong with the posted map . 
  i find the map weird . 
  i do acknowledge that there are quite a few people who like russia , but there 's no way they are the majority here , as the map indicates . 
  i 'm sorry , i just do not believe that . 
  i seriously do not believe over 50 % of my country sees russia in a positive way . 
  also , i know this does n't count , but i 'll say it anyway ... 
  i personally do n't know anyone that has a positive opinion of russia . 
  * edit : * [ 2014 statistic ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/182795/russia-receives-lowest-approval-world-highest.aspx?g_source=position3&amp;g_medium=related&amp;g_campaign=tiles ) shows that the percent of romanians who view russia favorably is 15 % . 
  you do n't live in ee . 
  understandable . 
  i 'm not siding with people who mock their death , but russian hate is very , very understandable . 
  nah . . our brothers , the moldovans celebrate it in january . 
  yes , we do . 
  the president always sends a message . 
  we 're orthodox too , but we celebrate it today . 
  aw damn !, 
  sorry to hear you ca n't have them for christmas . 
  that 's a pity !, 
  what did you snort mate ? 
  hehe . 
  yes , we 're orthodox . 
  fair enough !, 
  this reminds me of a discussion yesterday on / r/romania about how terrorism is low because we have a big number of secret service agents as a communist legacy and a lot of curious grandmas as neighbours . 
  yeah , i can imagine . 
  i just used `` they '' because i do n't know if / u/h2ppyme is a girl or a boy . 
  it 's unlikely something would happen , but better be safe than sorry !, 
  they seem to get offended by anything that remotely puts estonia in a bad light . 
  even a joke . 
  my family celebrates it on the 25th . 
  what we usually eat is : - [ salat\u0103 de boeuf ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2m3uthra_ic/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  here 's another [ picture ] ( http://www.jocooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/salata-de-beouf-1-2.jpg ) .

  sometimes stronger liquors . 
  there are other foods , but i 've just picked the main dishes . 
  ** nato : ** * seen at 4:52 pm *, 
  this article seems pretty bullshit to me . 
  corruption ? 
  what does that have to do with one 's safety in the city ? 
  and it 's not as widespread and as bad as to affect you in any way . 
  the worst that could happen is taxi drivers who 'd try to trick you , but the airport has a special system so you wo n't be fooled . 
  *** una in diversitate ***, 
  he and his buddies will never get what they truly deserve for what they did during the 1989 revolution or the mineriad , but i do hope that ion iliescu lives long enough to face justice together with his comrades .
