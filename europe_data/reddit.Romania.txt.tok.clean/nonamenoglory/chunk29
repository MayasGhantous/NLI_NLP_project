  they need to be convicted for crimes against humanity . 
  oh ... were you expecting someone to take you seriously ? 
  lol, 
  again ? 
  i thought we talked about this once . 
  do you people even know anything about ee besides it being former communist states ? 
  ~ ~ russia ~ ~ science . 
   the authorities in bucharest are now negotiating with the united states , given that the allied european states announced that they could n't provide the requested number of aircraft to romania . 
   `` for reasons related to the general security 's evolution , none of these allies can provide a full squadron of f-16s . 
  therefore , towards the end of the year , we started having direct talks with the manufacturer 's government , the u.s. government , which has a comprehensive vision . 
  we will put together an offer that can be analyzed , '' motoc said , reports local digi24 . 
  we do n't exactly have functioning hearts so ... 
   google compromise , this was n't one . 
  what happened was a destruction of gun culture and gun ownership in countries with far lower homicide rates than the rest of the eu under the lie that it will prevent terrorism ( it wo n't ) . 
  yeah , compromise was n't the word for it , i 'm sorry . 
  thing is ... the majority of eu countries do not have a gun culture . 
  why should everyone else change that to fit which countries exactly ? 
  it might not prevent terrorism , i agree , but i still do n't want something like that . 
  and if we 're to take a vote on it eu wide , i 'm not sure the vote would be in your favor . 
  i 'm not trying to be rude or anything , it 's just how things are . 
  i did n't start the conversation about free trade . 
  jigssaw did . 
   he said this is n't the union they wanted , that all they wanted was free movement and common market . 
  i said that a union implies obligations too and you ca n't wish to benefit from it without making some compromises if the rest of the countries in the union agree . 
   the day the euro goes to shit and the day that the eu goes to shit , i will be celebrating on the streets . 
  i do n't think anyone who can say this was ever pro anything regarding eu . 
  fuck other countries and their economies and anything they stand for : what matters is muh guns . 
  except you 're not germany or france or the uk , etc when it comes to trade . 
  your trade is less important to the eu than the legislation that , i think , most of eu agrees on . 
  so you want perks but not obligations ? 
  hm ... reminds me of a certain country that wants to stay in the single market without respecting the rules of the single market . 
  oh , i get it now , you 're that kind of guy, 
  i really want to give you gold right now  ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ), 
  do * bro * gea, 
  what 's ew ? 
  we 've gotten used to it . 
  it 's great for the memeconomy . 
  not so great for the actual economy ... 
  you 're overreacting . 
  it 's like saying , `` i will be fucked anyway , but i want to be fucked by someone with a romanian name specifically . '', 
  what matters is that dragnea is behind all this . 
  and buddy , if you think orban is better maybe you * should * move to hungary . 
  nah , it 's just that the public was already used to the name `` klaus iohannis '' so they moved onto werner to emphasize it even more . 
  i think that you do not need to change your profile picture into a flag to feel sadness and anger over what happened . 
  however , i do feel like : - some people felt justified to write mean comments about merkel and germany . 
  - some people have gotten used to this kind of things . 
  the second point is what makes me the most uncomfortable . 
  we should not get used to these things . 
  her religion is not the problem . 
  it does count , she * is * a tatar muslim with a syrian husband , but it 's not the most important aspect of the news . 
  that 's true too , i forgot about dragnea and the chamber of deputies , but i thought that his `` for the moment '' comments seemed to say `` we 'll change the law and i 'll take over '' . 
  you might be right though . 
  well , they do have a short memory so you might not be wrong . 
  i also think there 's a chance this pm proposition is just until dragnea can take the wheel . 
  what do you think ? 
  of course . 
  if the money keeps coming , they wo n't give a fuck . 
  psd voters , however , might feel betrayed . 
  some of them at least . 
  what 's the funniest thing is that psd , throughout the whole campaign , emphasized that our technocrat pm ( who used to be a eu commissioner ) was not romanian enough and kept mocking his name , dacian * julien * ciolo\u015f . 
  he did the same with our ethnic german president , klaus * werner * iohannis . 
  * we 're not selling our country to foreigners !, 
  * sort of rhetoric . 
   according to the 2011 census , 64,337 people , approx . 
  0.3 % of the total population , indicated that their religion was islam . 
  most probably . 
  i 've just grown to really hate the sight of red used like that on maps . 
  can we for once use blue on eastern europe red always makes me think of urss, 
  idk about awkward , i 'd say unfortunate , but i remember the france attacks in november 2015 and how much it took the police to catch the guy even though they knew who he was . 
  and he was living a couple of blocks down from his childhood home in brussels if i remember well . 
  just heard about this on tv . 
  if there 's no footage , it 'll be hard because they have no indication of what he looks like . 
  maybe witnesses can help identify him ? 
  someone must have seen him run away from the truck . 
  anyway ... no easy work for the police . 
  close your eyes and call us austrians, 
  come on boys !, 
  we 're almost there !, 
  93030 km2 more to go :'), 
  there 's one thing to have crime and another to have assassinations of officials and terrorist attacks . 
  bur my bad , thought it was n't the norm, 
  no , you 're right , it 's 3 with zurich . 
  i thought something happened in czechia or so too . 
  i 'm thinking the same . 
  2017 might be just as bad . 
  and if things do n't change , people will get very , very angry . 
  4 incidents in one day . 
  this is insane edit : 3 * . 
  for some reason i thought something happened in czechia . 
  they need to catch that motherfucker before he does any more damage . 
  jesus , what an awful day, 
  what a `` merry christmas '' : /, 
  yeah , but it still sounds bad . 
  i keep seeing `` several dead and multiple injured '' . 
  afp also said at least 50 injured ... 
  i immediately thought of nice when i heard and it 's honestly horrible . 
  and it 's a christmas market too . 
  the people who do this are scum !, 
  stay strong germany !,
