  they 've formed this year so i do n't know much about them . 
  it 's not sure they 'll be able to enter the parliament at all . 
  hope they do n't . 
  they 're a scum party created by a corrupt idiot . 
  they 're far right as well . 
  that must be very reassuring for sweden, 
  careful , r/de and r/russia might want to hug you, 
  lies and slander !, 
  so / r/czech has been invaded by / r/uk ? 
   / r/rocirclejerk s ^ o r ^ o s, 
  i guess the party really does n't start until / r/russia [ walks in ... ] ( http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/546632b46bb3f7827f2a9af0-1200-858/pro%20russia%20military%20vehicles%20tanks%20donetsk%20ukraine.jpg ), 
  i. . uhm . . no * goddamn it *, 
  you stay away from our oil this time you psychos, 
  / r/austria : new phone who dis, 
   russia just f off in general fair enough, 
  do n't you worry / r/de , / r/romania 's here to back you up !,

   more educated individuals were more likely to vote leave and be more liberal . 
  you meant remain ? 
  indeed it does n't make any sense . 
  idk what the eu is thinking . 
  and they say this sub has a thing against the uk . 
  lol, 
  most probably . 
  i wonder if the data for greece has changed in any way . 
  this is a macabre thought, 
  regions where the hungarian ethnic minority lives are part of the wealthier regions of romania . 
  france and romania have exchanged flags apparently . 
  thank you !, 
  is n't that like saying that when no one talked about transgender people , there were no transgender people ? 
  thank you :d, 
  can someone better explain to me what this represents ? 
  kind of like eli5, 
  good . 
  hopefully today 's russia could stop its expansionist politics as well . 
  you 're right . 
  i should have mentioned the us system . 
   the social dimension might be reverse with the ee left being the conservative , discriminatory similar to the right in the we . 
  i actually had that in mind when i wrote it, 
  how am i confusing them ? 
  i did say they 're different here because liberals are right wing, 
   which is hardly questionable why is that ? 
  i hate psd as much as the next guy , but if you want to make that hardly questionable , you 'll have to show me something concrete that shows why they are the most pro russian party . 
  policies and anti eu stances . 
  what iliescu did is no longer the accurate image of psd . 
  they 're still bad , but a different kind of bad . 
  they know that russia has a failing economy and that china 's is looking good . 
  that 's why there were talks about stronger ties between us and china during ponta 's time . 
  unlike iliescu , who at the time had personal feelings about russia , none of these guys have them . 
  and if some of them do have that sort of feelings , they 're nowhere near iliescu 's level of * < 3 russia * i think this doubt has died with nastase and geoana of course . 
  i might be wrong and if you reply with the relevant information , i 'd have to add another huge reason on my list of `` why is psd scum ''  political suicide i agree . 
  which is why even if they had any loving feelings towards russia , they would n't be able to do anything about it because the people would fuck them up . 
   pro-russian party they are not pro russian . 
  they wanted closer ties with china , but have judged russia many times . 
  there are no pro russian romanian parties . 
  my bad i got left mixedup with right in that case . 
  the liberals are the right wing here . 
  no , do n't look there , look [ here ] ( http://mediartv1.freenode.ro/image/201511/w620/dacian_ciolos_experiment_69858800.jpg ), 
  i think it has more to do with the fact that the majority of psd fans and psd will use anything against their oppossition . 
  people usually associate soros with ngos ( which are usually about things psd voters do n't care ) , liberals ( the right aka their opposition ) and corporate interests . 
  aka . . no one 's gon na give them something . 
  they usually think he meddles with the politics in our countries . 
  and in many others . 
  i 've visited the politicians ' pages who bash the liberals and associate them with soros . 
  rarely there 's a comment about him being jewish and i 've never seen someone talk about his hungarian ethnicity . 
  but that 's just my experience . 
  why is this relevant to / r/europe ? 
  something something funds many ngos ( and some think his funds might go into political business too ) something something corporate interests something something damn liberals that 's what i hear, 
   usr psd coalition that sounds unlikely . 
  such assumptions probably come out because usr has not assumed an ideology . 
  left and right are different in romania . 
  what the right is in the us is more like the left in the romania and vice versa . 
  * but what 's even more important to notice is that while the parties do keep some of their ideological principles , it 's not surprising to find out that the right supports a law that is more left than right . 
  that mostly happens for the sake of votes or if there 's some sort of self interest . 
  this is my perspective on it . 
  edit : * initially said east vs west and was corrected, 
  that 's a good strategy, 
   s-o-r-o-sh goddamn it ... 
  same here . 
  apparently , anyone who does n't vote for the social democrats or alde or any of their friend parties is paid by soros, 
  psd ( social democrats ) and co. are embarrassing . 
  i really , really hope ciolos gets the chance to be the pm for the next 4 years . 
  he 's the best we 've got . 
  #gociolos if he does n't , christmas is cancelled !, 
  also , a clarification , because the independent seems to think that liviu dragnea ( psd ) as a pm would be a blessing for romania and europe : 1 . he 's been convicted . 
  he ca n't be a pm . 
  2 . he may be pro eu and all that , but he 's also very corrupt . 
  and so is his party ( psd ) , along with alde and similar smaller parties . 
  what ?? 
  russian ? 
   that would have powers to investigate tax fraud that costs eu governments at least $ 50 billion a year . 
  i 'd think this also covers countries like luxembourg . 
  i may have heard wrong , but i heard there 's some tax evasion going on there ? 
  did i say that ? 
  i said illegal places of worship . 
  which means unauthorized places of worship . 
  well yes . 
  they are : 1 . afraid udmr wo n't take the 5 % 2 . think they are being ethnically targeted ( which , of course , is bullshit . ), 
   the only diplomatic issue with romania is that their anti-corruption policies seem to target minority leaders too much . 
  well , that 's stupid .
