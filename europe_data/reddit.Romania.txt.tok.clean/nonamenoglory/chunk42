  it 's foreign troops who come here and engage in exercises with our military who are a bit behind and need an upgrade . 
  which is why they 're also sending us military equipment . 
  if you 're implying that they have their own interests in the area , i 'm not fighting you . 
  i know the us and west have their own interest here , which is to keep russia at bay , but we do n't mind it because keeping russia at bay means our security is good . 
  it 's not that we 're head over heels for the us or for foreign military presence on our territory , it 's that russia is a bigger threat to us . 
  and because we have a *** defensive *** missile shield at deveselu , russia has threatened us with a nuclear attack . 
  but it is n't like the shield is the only thing that made russia hostile towards us . 
  your politicians threaten us so often that nobody 's surprised anymore . 
  but i do n't get why you 're not happy . 
  seems that trump is more interested in having a close relationship with russia rather than his relationship with eastern europe . 
  i 'm also curious ... if we ask russia to leave ukraine and give them back their territory , will they ? 
   anti-gypsy eesti , do n't test me, 
  another map that has israel but not romania . 
  is this a secret plan to replace romania with israel ???? 
   why they are so afraid of ` possible ' russian invasion ? 
  because we know what a russian invasion looks like . 
   they are already occupied by foreign forces , we are n't occupied . 
  whatever foreign forces are present on our territory are here with our consent . 
   they are unable to quit international unions like eu or eurozone idk about eurozone , but you can leave eu whenever you want . 
  uk is leaving it if you have n't heard . 
   and basically they are bankrupts because their national economies live trough infusions from eu while local businesses are falling in decline . 
  well , i mean , even if i were to follow your logic , at least we have the eu to blame . 
  who 's to blame for russia 's economic failure ? 
   and they even voted for it . 
  that 's how democracies work . 
  see ? 
  this is the kind of solidarity that the west does n't have for the east . 
  i mean , hell , we were deep into nazi shit in ww2 and we still helped poland . 
  love y' all eastern neighbours . 
  except hungary of course . 
  makes my blood boil tbh, 
  that would make them just as bad as russia . 
   the worst we have to worry about is our economy top notch solidarity there mate, 
  well , apparently alde leaders do n't invest enough interest in their youth group so the youth group leader decided `` fuck it ! '', 
  and they all went to pnl . 
  i do n't know how this will affect alde and if it 'll still manage to get the 5 % for the parliamentary elections , but i doubt they 're breaking up . 
  can you link me up ? 
  i do n't know what you 're referring to . 
  are you referring to alde youth group from valcea quitting alde to join pnl ? 
  yet they were told by gingrich that us is n't sure they 'd risk nuclear war over them , who spend their 2 % . 
  imagine what the rest that do n't spend 2 % think when they hear such comments . 
  i do n't dislike that israel is here , but it annoys me because this is n't the only graph that does n't have certain eu countries included and i 'm :( bc i 'm a curious person, 
  israel is here , but romania is n't . 
   the fear here is that the united states is keen to see russia as a potential partner and reluctant to share the view in eastern europe that moscow presents a potent and immediate military threat . 
  i think that the fear we 're talking about here is whether or not usa would step in and how quick the west can move in case of something . 
  i 'd like to say that a russian move is unlikely , but i can not take it out of the realm of possibilities . 
  yes , they 're expected to have the majority , at the very least together with alde ( the alliance of liberals and democrats ) . 
  i really , really hope they do n't because they 're a corrupt , populist party . 
  the national liberals have corruption too , but they 're mostly incompetent and i , for one , believe that there 's still hope for someone to fix pnl , but not for the social democrats . 
  the problem is that the national liberals have a smaller electorate ( and they keep disappoint a part of their electorate with their stupid choices ) and usr ( save romania union ) is a new party with no chance to get a majority or , from what i heard , more than 13 % of the votes . 
   last time i checked referendums needed a 50 % turnout to be enforced . 
  did they changed it ? 
  not sure , i 'll have to look it up and come back to you , but some people over at / r/romania were talking about a 30 % turnout needed a while ago . 
  it 's a bit unclear to me too . 
  edit : you are probably right . 
  50 % is needed . 
  ciolos recently presented his platform for romania , a platform which he would like romania to respect and follow in order to progress . 
  afterwards he stated that any party who will respect this platform , with the exception of social democrats ( and parties alike i suppose ) , can nominate him as a pm . 
  for now , pnl ( national liberals ) and usr ( save romania union ) support dacian ciolos as a pm , but pnl wants him to be a political pm that represents the party , while usr said that they have no problem with him continuing to be an apolitical pm . 
   psd will win that 's a given . 
  the question is will they get a majority ? 
  wait ... winning implies a majority , does n't it ? 
   the referendum will fail . 
  we ca n't get 50 % turnout for parliamentary elections for goodness sake ... that 's true , but then again , you know how organized these people are . 
  and you know that , like with brexit , they are more likely to turn up to the referendum rather than those who oppose the redefinition . 
  and they need 30 % turnout from what i know . 
  of course , i wish for it to fail , but i 'm still concerned . 
  you have no idea . 
  from a personal point of view , i think it 's a show of power from this religiously motivated organization which supposedly gathered 3 million signatures for the referendum . 
  homophobia in romania is a big problem , but this would n't matter as much if initiatives like this would n't be supported by some political parties in exchange for votes . 
  which makes the fight against it so much harder . 
  tomorrow there 's a protest against this . 
  imagine that our civil code already states that marriage/family is between a man and a woman . 
  changing the constitution makes no sense . 
  besides , these initiatives have no place in secular states . 
  you 're right , sorry . 
  seems useful for anyone who wants to keep up with upcoming political events . 
  i see you 're romanian so you probably know already what 's happening here , but i 'll say it anyway . 
  - parliamentary elections - 11 december likely to win : the social democrats ( + alde ) . 
  the main opposition is the national liberals alongside with save romania union . 
  ~ ~ * may the force be with us . 
  * ~ ~ - a referendum on redefining the term `` marriage '' in the definition of a family in the constitution . 
  probably in april 2017 . 
  the referendum will ask if we want the definition to remain as it is ( '' ** the family is founded on the freely consented marriage of the spouses ** , their full equality , as well as the right and duty of the parents to ensure the upbringing , education and instruction of their children . '' ), 
  or if we want to change * spouses * to * between a man and woman * to * mainly * emphasize that same sex couples can not be a family . 
  bullshit brought up by a social organization that wants to protect the traditional family . 
  we 're with you , baltic states . 
  but on this topic , is anyone willing to summarize that `` in case of invasion '' lithuanian pamphlet ? 
  i 've seen the piece of news back when it happened , but did n't see the actual pamphlet . 
  did everyone receive it ? 
   and using a huge machine to suck out their happiness for collective redistribution i need a bag of happiness pls . 
  there , there . . we can have all these things at once , we do n't need to pick . 
  what are his chances against merkel ? 
   largest consumer of anti-depressants !, 
  if this is true than i am concerned \u0ca0_\u0ca0  better than sweden !, 
  ah yes , we all love the nordic banter, 
   canada works for me , they have ( in my mind ) that aura of large uninhabited territory to be explored , and it appeals to me . 
  that 's true . 
  by the way , i found a nice video from alberta , canada . 
  looks amazing .
