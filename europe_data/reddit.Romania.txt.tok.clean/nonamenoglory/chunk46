  we have our bad stuff , our corruption ( which we 're trying to tackle day by day ) , our populism and our incompetents , but truth is we are very pro eu and nato because our security , as a country , depends on it . 
  hungary may not fear russia , but we do . 
  it was a mistake . 
  i doubt it was a mistake made out of lack of information rather just lack of attention . 
  we all know those facts , it 's really not a big deal . 
  it was a typo . 
  probably put in the wrong place , switching between him and orban . 
  no biggie, 
  r u saying antena3 is funded by russia ? 
  i think that 's a bit bold to say , even for a3 . 
  about the orthodox organizations ... yeah . 
  that seems credible . 
  there 's nothing idiotic about them , they are written in romanian . 
  it 's not that ukraine is pro russia , the map says that it 's in conflict with russia . 
  it does still have populism and a lot of corruption which makes it an unstable country . 
  lol . 
  reverse psychology . 
  ** romania : ** annex us ! ~ ** russia : ** no ** romania : ** do it you coward !, 
  ** russia : ** never !, 
  i fear the same . 
  he does n't have big chances to win the support of the people in romania or the baltics through misinformation and propaganda ( not saying that there are n't pro russia romanians , just saying that they 're a quite small minority compared to other countries ) so i fear we 'll be subjected to more direct aggression than just propaganda . 
  maybe an attempted coup or green men ? 
  russia also funds separatist movements in romania so ... 
  social democrats mostly , but you have to understand that most parties have some populism in them . 
  recently , usr ( save romania union ) is the exception , but it 's also a new party with no hope to get the majority 's vote . 
  pnl ( national liberals ) , psd 's oldest opposition , has its own populism and corruption , but it 's a bit better than psd , in my opinion . 
  come december , we might be going in the same direction ( populist ) . 
  i mean , we already have a populist parliament , the question is whether or not they 'll win this next election too . 
  hopefully not . 
  however , there 's still very little anti eu sentiment or pro russia sentiment within our politics . 
  r u asking a german if he knows what propaganda is ? 
  we wo n't give her to you , but she 'll cover your politicians too once we annex you . 
  i appreciate your dedication tho . 
  that 's alright , i can sympathize . 
  our parliamentary elections are on 11 december and while i hope for the best , it 's pretty much a shit show . 
  people still voting for corrupt politicians . 
  seems dodon is in the lead in moldova too . 
  guys ... it 's time for romania to learn from us overlords and liberate you both . 
  [ let 's switch ] ( https://www.google.ro/?gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=fymowkphesagsag7vkd4da#q=bucharest+weather ), 
  i 'm from romania . 
  having flags at your window or stuff alike is n't frowned upon . 
  i ca n't say i 've seen many wearing clothing with our flag on it apart from those who wear the national football jerseys outside of football events and some people at protests . 
  anyhow , it is n't at all like in germany , where people feel it 's unnecessary or inappropriate to wave a flag or similar activities . 
  we have quite a large number of nationalists . 
  had this [ cat ] ( http://imgur.com/a/h5sdg ) for 11 years . 
  wonderful cat . 
  we will have a referendum to change `` spouses '' from `` a man and a woman '' too . 
  religious nutter advocating for `` traditional family '' called for it . 
  i hope it fails . 
  she could have done some things differently , but she 's still an influential leader . 
  i guess , overall , my opinion of her is positive . 
  romania : - corruption - russia europe : - right wing extremists - brexit and its consequences . 
  - trump fucking nato/eu up - russia civilization : - war - climate change, 
  hahaha !, 
  well , they did assure us they would n't mind us annexing them if we could help them with the corruption . 
  - i think the nordic countries are really great . 
  their socio-economical and political attitudes have turned them into the most progressive countries in europe . 
  - i wish we could be closer to italy , spain , portugal and france . 
  everyone has a neighbour that it 's close to linguistically and culturally . 
  except us . 
  and the weather would also be nicer so there 's that . 
  switzerland ? 
  what do you say ? 
  you could make eastern europe great again if we switch . 
  or just throw us somewhere between france and spain . 
  that way we 're far away from russia too . 
  second point is only partially sarcastic . 
  sneaky serbia . 
  brolgaria would never do that !, 
  all of us would just go chill on the bulgarian beaches !, 
  alright , buddy . 
  i 'm done fighting with you because you 're delusional . 
  it 's obvious that you ca n't or do n't want to understand . 
  ** our unification did n't happen because nazi germany and fascist italy gave us other countries ' lands , our unification happened because in 1918 the majority of transylvania was romanian and wanted to unite . 
  they * voted * . 
  ** if it makes you feel better , i can be the chauvinist and you can be the eternal victim . 
  so you can sleep better at night . 
  why ? 
  just because i say that ? 
  please . 
  it 's a fact , not a nationalistic opinion . 
  i 'm sorry most of you were raised to believe otherwise and to hate us . 
  i 'm sorry that your politicians continue to poke every one of your neighbours and create tensions ( with the exception of austria , of course , to whom you 'd love to be a part of , but who no longer cares about you ) . 
  nobody even votes for nationalist parties here . 
  the only one that competed recently did n't get 5 % of the votes to enter the parliament . 
  this is not hungary . 
  what 's my shitty nationalist agenda ? 
  i 'd really like to known . 
  everything i 've stated so far are well known facts . 
  it is that bad . 
  but a lot of romanians are so used to public humiliation on the international scene that they forget dignity in the face of hungarian politicians . 
   no , it would be the same as romanias national day , celebrating a day when the nation was truly unified , when finally all hungarians were again inside hungary . 
  nothing fascist about it , it did n't even happen during the fascist era . 
  ... are you serious ? 
   even though it existed for 60 years at that point , but `` we ca n't be a real good nation until we invade some place ai n't that right guys ? '', 
  transylvania is rightful romanian territory , i 'm sorry you 're too brainwashed to see it . 
  yes , we should be thankful you 're not actively trying to murder us every day . 
  by the way , the downvote buttons are n't for when you disagree with someone . 
  edit : they are terrorists , but it is n't surprising you 'd play that down . 
  covering up for actually dangerous people .
