  my mother helped translate some of it for me , but she could n't always do that so i learned quickly . 
  they eventually started translating it so it was okay . 
  - french - i 've had french since middle school , but to be honest , throughout my whole education , french teachers have sucked . 
  i also did n't like the language very much back then because the pronunciation seemed very difficult . 
  some of it stuck with me , but too little . 
  i know words and phrases , i can read it with a bad accent and i can understand some of it , but it 's not enough . 
  i ca n't really speak it . 
  - latin - had it throughout highschool , but i never paid too much attention to it . 
  kinda feel bad about it now . 
  it certainly is an interesting language and it is the root language of romanian . 
  - bulgarian - i 'm not an ethnic bulgarian , but i went to a bulgarian highschool . 
  everything was taught in romanian , but bulgarian classes were mandatory for one year ( unless you were an ethnic bulgarian and opted for full course aka 4 years ) . 
  unfortunately , the teacher that was there during my time was not romanian . 
  she was bulgarian and she only spoke her language and russian . 
  her english was too broken to be actually useful . 
  our classes basically had to be translated by two of our classmates that were from basarabia and who knew both russian and bulgarian . 
  it was only one year and i was n't interested , but i still know how to present myself and count to 10 . 
  despite the language barrier , she was a fun teacher . 
  - chinese - in the last year of highschool we had a chinese class taught by a chinese girl who knew english and taught in english . 
  unfortunately for her and for the language , the last year is crazy with the final exams coming up so no one was really up for learning something new . 
  i still know some phrases and words though . 
  all in all , my language experience was bad because i 'm still stuck with just romanian and english . 
  it is my fault too , of course . 
  i 'd like to learn spanish , but i 'm a lazy bum . 
  i do n't know what you mean by `` constituency '' but our president is [ klaus iohannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_iohannis ) and he was a mayor of sibiu city before running for president . 
  he was also a member of the pnl ( national liberals ) party . 
  beauty is subjective , but like someone said here , maybe eastern girls do think appearance is important so they use make up and clothing to their advantage . 
  however , you should know that most people on this sub think swedish girls are the prettiest because of their fair skin and blue eyes so yeah . 
  [ yes , we do , especially in parks . 
  ] ( http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s398/lancerbusteni42/tasnitoare.jpg ) there used to be more , but some have disappeared over the years . 
  there are also a few designed so that a dog can drink too , but they are rare . 
  good one op , gave green light for a subtle anti romania circlejerk . 
  no one 's willing to even acknowledge they have a roma population that does n't necessarily come from romania . 
  it 's always those damn * romanian gypsies * . 
  then again , many of them do not recognize that roma were killed in large numbers during the holocaust either . 
  or that roma are n't white . 
  so does estonia not have a gypsy population of their own or did they all parish during the holocaust ? 
   gypsies are white not really . 
  they have indian ancestry . 
  indians are n't white . 
   there also seems to be a slight problem with gypsies from romania . 
  roma with romanian citizenship ? 
  or people assume they 're romanian either way ? 
   erm . 
  well firstly it 's absolutely nothing remotely like the situation that blacks had in the us . 
  it is though . 
  they were n't just enslaved , they were also victims of the holocaust . 
  and they 're still very discriminated . 
   within temptation nice :d, 
  since we 're on the topic ... 
  i need to know what spanish people think of enrique iglesias !, 
  i 've always wondered . 
  i usually answer them because i 'm polite and i have anxiety so my anxiety makes me want to make sure i do n't seem impolite . 
  i do n't really enjoy it unless it 's someone who seems very pleasant . 
  i just go along with it until i 'm out of there , but replies remain short . 
  i try to smile too . 
  they keep showing shocking footage from there and videos of people who ask for help and which end in `` this may be my last video '' . 
  they have been showing things for a while now , how hospitals are being bombed and civilians killed in large numbers , how children are suffering . 
  i do n't know much about the situation itself . 
  i 'm not informed enough to know who 's right and who 's wrong , or even if there 's anyone who 's right at all . 
  i just know that the way it 's being done ... not very effective or efficient . 
  besides , we have a latin version which should obviously be used as the official one because latin  german . 
  roman empire stronk !, 
  he was and is pretty popular in romania too . 
  and he is referred to as the king of pop . 
  i remember my mom said that when he came to hold a concert in romania in 1992 , she was so sad she had no money to go see him . 
  my mom likes him a lot . 
  and , inspired by the one that took place in stockholm , some people did [ this dance tribute ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-airjyrlo ) to show their appreciation to michael . 
  could be . 
  we have a [ romanian ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/od%c4%83_bucuriei ) version too , but i think the lyrics are a bit different as well . 
  and it 's shorter it seems . 
  generally , european countries have agreed to only keep the instrumental as the official anthem , but german lyrics are widely used when performing the song . 
  damn . 
  that 's called `` untur\u0103 '' here . 
  i do n't like it and i do n't know anyone who actually eats it , not in that form anyway . 
  something close to that would be '' [ sl\u0103nin\u0103 ] ( http://www.bzi.ro/public/upload/photos/196/slaninabuna.jpg ) '' and i know some people that do it this . 
  i do n't like either . 
  some people say we have beautiful women , but like you said , it 's subjective . 
  well , that has more to do with politeness than anything else . 
  not really . 
  it 's creepy if you ask me . 
  besides the fact that it reminds europeans of the nazis , the communists also had similar habits of worship . 
  romanians have a history with both . 
  before the 90s , they would usually play the hymn and you had to stand up for that , but it 's no longer practiced as far as i know . 
  besides , there was always a picture with ceausescu in the class . 
  children sometimes still stand when the teacher walks into the class , maybe salute him and then they sit down . 
  we do n't have anything like that . 
  and this comes from a person living in romania where the last elections had 40 % presence and a corrupt party won with 46 % of the votes . 
  i believe the solution lies in the education system . 
  - teaching children ethical values and civic duties - teaching children the basics of the politics in said country . 
  the roles of the institutions and maybe even a bit about the history of the parties . 
  objectively . 
  when denmark ends up like romania , then we should talk . 
  i 'm kidding . 
  i agree . 
  the solution should n't be restrictive voting , but in romania 's case , it would be - promoting that voting is important so people actually go and vote - early political and ethical education . 
  so they stop voting corrupt people ffs . 
  the fault obviously lies with our education system . 
  - [ the glorious european flag ] ( http://static.snopes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/eu-flags.jpg ) - [ the glorious european anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) , in glorious [ latin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_mefzb4yzk ) too  - [ winds of change ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4rjjkxsamq ) by the scorpions - ~ ~ honestly , this song makes me both sad and happy . 
  on one hand , the cold war ended , everyone was finally free , you can even see footage from the romanian revolution , but it makes me sad to know how underdeveloped we are today because of being behind the iron curtain .
