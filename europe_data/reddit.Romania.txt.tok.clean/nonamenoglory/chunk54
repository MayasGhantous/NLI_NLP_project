  not to mention that `` finally free '' is relative and more official for romania when it comes to the first years after the 1989 revolution . ~ ~ - 5th ( council of europe ) and 9th ( eu ) of may - unity in diversity !!! 11 !, 
  - [ the euro ] ( https://www.colourbox.com/preview/4881717-european-union-symbol-and-euro-sign.jpg ), 
   for example , can you tell if someone is polish on the street without needing to hear them talk polish ? 
   uk flag are you implying something mister ? 
  ^ ^ / s have n't traveled enough to give you a proper answer but i 'll have to say not really . 
  unless i hear the language , probably not . 
  that is very good to hear . 
  it 's how it should be . 
  easterns generally have that `` we suck so much '' attitude . 
  between us easterns , it 's funny up to a point , but i 've seen some westerners concerned with our pessimism . 
  could be a communist legacy . 
   europe is n't a monolithic culture , nor are the us or canada . 
  but the us and canada are far closer culturally than anyone in europe . 
  you 're right , but i would argue europe is much more deverse than these two countries . 
  after all , we 're talking about 51 countries in it . 
   i assure you that consume far more us culture than canadian . 
  that 's true , but that 's one thing . 
  it does n't deny those : better gun laws , more liberal , french canadians , handsome pm , better healthcare than us and a lack of a military culture . 
   each state in the us has it 's own gun laws and even some local municipalities . 
  a blanket statement like that makes no sense . 
  yes , it does . 
  just look at the difference in gun related deaths or crimes in both countries . 
   basically , this sub consists of arrogant ignorant europeans who have a chip on their shoulder about the us and do n't know much about the world at all . 
  and especially canada as we can see . 
  aka :  boohoo , people have different opinions than me , the know it all , 
   itt ignorant europeans say completely absurd things about canada because they do n't know shit about it . 
  so us is culturally closer to europe than canada is to europe ? 
   they have a shitload of guns . 
  my bad , i meant better gun laws, 
  oh boy - people who keep electing corrupt people . 
  selfish people who only think of themselves and * now * without caring about the bigger picture . 
  - old buildings not being restored when some of them threaten to fall down on someone 's head . 
  it 's a complicated process for the government to do so when those buildings are n't public property anymore and legislation should be changed . 
  - lack of interest in politics or lack of knowledge about politics . 
  which means a vote turnout lower than 50 % . 
  - being geographically close to russia . 
  can we just move the country next to it 's bros in the south west ? 
  please and thank you . 
  - the instability that the new parliament and government will create . 
  - people are generally nice , but some are downright cunts . 
  - people who do n't emigrate legally . 
  - the political and economical instability being the cause of a massive brain drain . 
  and there 's more . 
  canada is culturally closer to europe than the us is to europe . 
  no guns , more liberal , french canadians , handsome pm , better healthcare than us and a lack of a military culture . 
  very nice place , i imagine , but i 've never been . 
  there are also some canadian military troops here in romania . 
  cooperation is always nice . 
  a lot of them . 
  from the roman empire to the first post communism president . 
  - ** the roman empire 's conquest of dacia . 
  ** the romans heavily colonized dacia , and thus started a period of intense romanization , the vulgar latin giving birth to the proto-romanian language . 
  we have references to our ancestors in our hymn : now or never let us give proof to the world that in these veins a roman blood still flows , that in our chests we hold a name with pride , victorious in battle , the name of trajan * !, 
  * where trajan or traian is the roman emperor who conquered dacia . 
  it was basically the `` formation '' of the romanian people . 
  some people feel a strong attachment to these ancestors , and a lot of them especially to the dacians . 
  - ** the unification of the romanian principalities ** . 
  first between \u0162ara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 and moldova , and later followed by transylvania , is seen as a very important part of our history because it 's when we essentially became romania as it is today ( with the mention that we 've lost some territories since then ) . 
  so much so that we do n't celebrate our independence day ( may 9th 1877 ) as our national day and instead we celebrate the great union day ( december 1st 1918 ) as our national day . 
  this is was [ greater romania ] ( https://datinisitraditii.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/romania_1930.png ) looked like . 
  - ** king michael i of romania ** , one of the last monarchs from the wwii period to still be alive . 
  he 's also the last surviving monarch or other head of state from the interwar period . 
  he 's currently 95 years old . 
  following his father 's exile , michael i became king at the young age of 19 , in 1940 . 
  being this young , the power was easily seized from him by ion antonescu , a fascist dictator and a close ally of hitler 's . 
  ion antonescu staged a coup and eventually declared war to the soviet union , wishing to retrieve basarabia and northern bucovina ( among other reasons , like being hitler 's ally ) , without the king 's knowledge . 
  ion antonescu is also officially responsible for the holocaust in romania , which resulted with the death of 280,000 - 380,000 jews . 
  a lot of romani people were also victims of the holocaust . 
  later on , in 1944 , king michael i , along with the remaining opposition leaders , staged a coup against ion antonescu , having him arrested . 
  shortly after the end of the war , he was prosecuted for war crimes , crimes against peace and treason , and he was executed . 
  after the soviet union 's invasion of romania and the installment of communists , michael i was forced to abdicate at gun point and blackmailed , being told that if he does n't sign the abdication documents , some 1000 students that were detained will be executed . 
  following his abdication , he was also sent into exile by the communists . 
  post communist leaders , such as ion iliescu , tried their best to keep the king out of the country , fearing that his popularity might bring down their governments . 
  ~ ~ and frankly , because they were cunts . ~ ~ now , the opinion of romanians vary . 
  most have respect for michael i , but there are some who consider him a traitor that `` left with a train full of gold '' , as they say . 
  they do not believe this :  michael i was forced to abdicate at gun point and blackmailed , being told that if he does n't sign the abdication documents , some 1000 students that were detained will be executed . 
  and believe that he is a coward . 
  there 's also a minority who hopes for the reinstallment of the monarchy with michael i as king . 
  truth is , no matter how much you like and respect michael i , this wish is unrealistic . 
  he is 95 years old and very sick . 
  his children are n't too popular either . 
  there are also mixed opinions about ion antonescu . 
  some see him for who he was , a fascist dictator that committed crimes against humanity , but there are also some people who see him as a hero . 
  they are usually racist nationalists . 
  a common motive you 're likely to hear is `` he was just trying to get our territories [ basarabia - now the country moldava - and bucovina - now part of ukraine ] back . 
  another truth is that a pupil does n't learn too much , if anything , about the romanian holocaust in school , which is really sad and revolting if you ask me . 
  - ** communist regime . 
  ** well , that 's a tough one for a lot of people . 
  communism was truly horrible for romania and it plays a massive role in the development dynamic between eastern europe and western europe . 
  it was the death of the intellectual elite who either fled the country or they were shunned , prosecuted and even murdered . 
  while most young people have absolutely no love for communism , there are older people who still think somewhat fondly of it . 
  there are several factors as to why these happens : 1 . 
  a lot of them lived most of their lives under the communist regime . 
  it is very hard to change one 's mentality , especially if they did n't particularly suffer during that time . 
  they do n't understand how democracy works . 
  a good example of this is that a lot of old people think `` why is n't the president / pm * personally * doing anything for me / doing anything to fix this ? '' . 
  this is the effect of living in a regime which was usually centered around one single person . 
  he was everything and everywhere . 
  a lack of education also plays an important part . 
  people who do n't think or do n't see how democracy serves them .
