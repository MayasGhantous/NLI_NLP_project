  that 's too bad . 
  yeah , that also seems to be a problem . 
  i do n't know ... hungary should be better than this . 
  well , we have more external borders than hungary , with serbia , moldova and ukraine , and you do n't see us building fences . 
  even the guy who was then our pm , a populist idiot , criticized orban for such measures . 
  not at all . 
  i do n't hate hungarians . 
  i hate orban and the choices he makes . 
  some countries make me doubt their european spirit , like hungary who likes building fences and what not , but i do n't think any of the current eu members is doing anything that bad for me to want them to be kicked out . 
  i 'm not counting uk because they voted out . 
  with the family , lots of food and with presents . 
  some relatives come on christmas day . 
  tv is either on some christmas special or music . 
  and there 's talking . 
  lots of talking . 
  oh and drinking . 
  ca n't forget the drinking . 
  it was n't named after the egyptian city though . 
   alexandria was named after its founder , alexandru ii ghica , prince of wallachia from 1834 to 1842 . 
  the amount of salt is incredible . 
  i love it . 
  i 'd ask , but do n't get your hopes up too high, 
  their rich cultures . 
  the amount of history each country has is amazing and you can always find something interesting to see or learn . 
  i 'd recommend visiting romania , especially outside of bucharest , because it 's a beautiful country that most people dismiss because of its bad reputation . 
  we have some real nice music festivals too . 
  best ? 
  remains a union of sovereign nations , but much more efficient in solving issues and implementing some common policies that are needed . 
  invests in eu army and while it does n't rely on us military anymore , it keeps them as a close ally . 
  keeping nato is debatable . 
  worst ? 
  it breaks up . 
  especially since i believe that there could be solutions for problems the eu is facing right now . 
  we just need to be willing to solve them . 
  the rise of far right parties makes that very hard because to me it seems like they just want the popularity vote for `` sticking it to the man '' rather than discussing and trying to solve all these issues they 're accusing the eu of by communicating better with the eu . 
  only if they meet the criteria . 
  and if they 're in europe . 
  looking at you , australia . 
  ^ ^ / s i would n't have anyone out of the eu , but there are countries which sometimes make me question their support of eu values . 
  well deserved circlejerk in our subreddit is about our current pm , dacian ciolos . 
  he 's very appreciated by many ( but not by most ) and is especially praised among the romanians on reddit . 
  we 've had our most decent cabinet because of him . 
  two days before the american election , the romanian subreddit made it to the front page with [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/5bs9js/hillary_%c8%99i_trump_sunt_varz%c4%83_hai_s%c4%83_ducem_un_lider/ ) post that says `` hillary and trump are phonies . 
  let 's bring a real leader to the front page ! '', 
  it was reported a lot by americans who were either butthurt about the claim or about it not being in english . 
   ro ( iohannis ) can not believe someone here actually knows him . 
  points to you !, 
   gyrboursshdbfistub accurate . 
  i looked up this lady and i remember her because she 's the badass that turned away that russian journalist, 
  putin ? 
  all i can name : france : francois hollande russia : vladimir putin moldova : igor dodon bulgaria : rumen radev ukraine : petro poroshenko, 
  putin knows you, 
  our anthem , [ de\u015fteapt\u0103-te rom\u00e2ne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqyclycq2vs ) , is the militant type and i think i like this type more because of the rhythm . 
  sometimes the words of militant/march anthems can be a bit nationalistic though , and they can invoke the wrong feelings in some people . 
  our anthem talks about our ancestry , war and christianity . 
  short version translation :  awaken thee , romanian , from that deathly sleep  into which you 've been sunken by the barbarian tyrants . 
   now or never sew yourself another fate  to whom even your cruel enemies may bow to . 
   now or never , let us give proof to the world  that in these hands of ours roman blood still flows  and that in our chests we proudly keep a name  triumphant in battles , a name of `` trajan '' . 
   look , majestic shadows , michael , stephen , corvinus :  the romanian nation , your grand-grandsons  with armed hands and your fire in their veins  `` a life of freedom or death '' , they all shout . 
   priests with the cross ahead , because the army is christian  the motto is freedom and it 's purpose is all too holy  we 'd rather die in battle , in elevated glory  than be slaves once more on our ancestral land . 
  also , i know this is n't an anthem , but i personally like this [ march song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jzglj_cyy ) that is usually used for official visits as a welcome march . 
  i can recognize romance languages ( french , spanish , italian , portuguese ) , german and greek  spanish from portugese ? 
  definitely, 
  the real horror, 
  to be fair i think that the hate in west against patriotism is not something that should be the norm . 
  i feel there 's a clear distinction between patriotism and nationalism and i believe patriotism is when you care about your country and you want it to prosper alongside other countries while nationalism is us vs them rhetoric and the inability to criticize your own country . 
  we were not part of the soviet union , but we did have communism for a long time [ so ... ] ( http://www.timesnewroman.ro/files/attach/images/127/539124/blocuri_comuniste_bucuresti.jpg ), 
  patriotism means caring about your country without the `` we 're better than x country '' bullshit ( aka nationalism , which is a better word for putin ) . 
  putin prefers that the people of his country suffer from economic sanctions and growing tensions rather than just retreating and making amends for what he did in ukraine . 
  the majority of people in romania do n't like putin , but we have our putin loving nutjobs too . 
  around the beginning of december . 
   i think they ought not to start until thanksgiving is over . 
  there 's no thanksgiving in europe and halloween is n't an official holiday here , it 's more of a marketing holiday where stores sell halloween themed stuff and some bars hold halloween parties . 
  person : romanian adjective : romanian language : romanian, 
  pretty often . 
  they may not be televised abroad , like the ones in france , but they happen often . 
  a strike ended just yesterday . 
  two recent strikes : 1 . doctors 2 . postal workers, 
  we kind of celebrate it with halloween themed parties , but it 's more of a marketing thing than the actual spirit of the holiday . 
  other than this , we do n't keep have any of the traditions like trick or treating . 
  generally , i 'd choose english , spanish , german and french . 
  the nordic languages would also be interesting to learn . 
  maybe even russian . 
  among others : ** nadia com\u0103neci ** - first [ perfect 10 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi_5xbd5xde ) in the history of olympics . 
  ** gheorghe hagi ** - romanian former footballer , considered one of the best attacking midfielders in europe during the 1980s and 1990s and the greatest romanian footballer of all time ** simona halep ** - romanian professional tennis player . 
  halep first broke into the world 's top 50 at the end of 2012 , reached the top 20 in august 2013 and finally the top 10 in january 2014 . 
  i once did it unintentionally in london . 
  i did n't realize i should n't cross at the moment and was n't paying attention so i almost got hit by a car and an angry british man said something to me but i did n't hear what he said . 
  ~ ~ i may have caused brexit and i do n't even know it . ~ ~ i usually try to wait for green or at least for all the cars in the front line to stop at their yellow . 
   are military shows/parades held on national day in your country ? 
  yes , there are . 
  here 's an [ example ] ( https://youtu.be/t03z-s8cdpe?t=32 ) . 
   if so , how big and do people care ? 
  pretty big , i 'd say . 
  and lots of people go to see it . 
  from bucharest . 
  i do n't cross the border at all , but i thought i 'd leave a comment . 
  80 kms for bulgaria 's border . 
  the closest to my city . 
  300 km to the ukraine border and about same to the moldovan one .
