  gagiu sounds extremely funny to me for some reason . 
  ** romantically : ** boyfriend : iubit girlfriend : iubit\u0103 ** and there 's a universal way of saying girlfriend/boyfriend that works for both girlfriend/boyfriend ( romantically ) and * friend * who happens to be a boy/a girl ) ** masculine : prieten feminine : prieten\u0103, 
  i 'm sure there 's people in my country who have harassed muslims for no reason and obviously those are idiots that you find in other countries too . 
  the only big islamophobic thing that happened here was that the state wanted to build this huge mosque or something ( which would have been no big deal seeing as how it 's better to have more mosques or one big mosque instead of unregistered ones where nasty shit could go down . 
  we have eighty mosques in the country afaik . ), 
  and people protested against it . 
  some people went to the place where it was supposed to be built and buried dead pigs in the ground . 
  frankly , i think that 's a pretty stupid thing to do and i do n't take people like that seriously . 
  other than this , muslims do n't seem to have many problems here . 
  not that i 've heard of . 
  last time i was in brasov , romania , there were so many foreign people . 
  it really surprised me . 
  germans , french , greeks , lots of israelis . 
  tourists are generally okay . 
  the only ones that stand out are drunk brits . 
  mostly they 're football fans . 
  edit : stupid question ... if i were to ever visit paris , would i get shit for not being able to actually speak french ? 
  ~ ~ ** the black sea ** ~ ~ the us , bulgaria , germany , moldova . 
  we can add spain and italy too , for commerce and culture . 
  considering its economic troubles , i think that at the moment , knowing they would n't be able to win a war against nato , they 're trying to destabilize countries and relationships within the eu and nato by : 1 . supporting separatist movements 2 . propaganda 3 . infiltrating governments recently , it 's been said that russia has a strong influence in bulgaria , hungary , latvia , serbia and slovakia ( 3 of our neighbour countries ) , which is somewhat worrying because while the situation is n't really dramatic at the moment , you never know what this influence can grow into given a couple of years . 
  they could also be thinking about annexing more territories outside of the eu and nato to try to impose their sphere of influence , but i 'm not sure . 
  they certainly plan to keep ukraine in a fucked up situation so they wo n't be able to join the eu or nato . 
  and afaik , china 's on their side . 
  ~ ~ if we were to talk of a war , in the end , it 's not about whether or not putin can win against the west , because he would n't , it 's about whether or not he 's crazy enough to start a war , despite having little chance to win it . 
  but it would n't be the first crazy thing russia does . ~ ~, 
   belarus what, 
  guys , why are you perfect ??? 
  * sobs *, 
  a war between vampires and zombies ? 
  sounds cliche , but * sigh * someone 's got ta do it, 
  according to the english proficiency index , we rank 16th . 
  what i can tell you is that the majority of young people know english . 
  there are older folks who know it too . 
  it 's less common among the oldest . 
  nothing is dubbed here besides cartoons . 
  everything else is subtitled . 
  / r/rocirclejerk i never go to it though so beware in your travels . 
  lol . 
  most sound appealing to me . 
  yes , i do . 
  maybe not as much as romanian , but close to it . 
  i 'm romanian and european . 
  acknowledging myself as a romanian is mainly to point out that i come from a country and i have a certain culture and experience . 
  i think it 's good to point out that you 're both because while yes , we 're all european , that does n't point out where you 're from and what your culture is , which is important in europe . 
  cultures are different and beautiful . 
  unity in diversity . 
  that was so random . 
  i laughed, 
  people here say that they consider eastern europe part of the west , but sometimes ... it does n't feel like they do . 
   sometimes slavic ha !, 
  romania can into west ... * sometimes *, 
  why is n't romania part of west ? 
  i mean what 's your criteria if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  spain : not recent discovery and the artist is internationally famous , but i have listened to this [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxi8rqyc36q ) more than i want to admit . 
  yeah , romanians do n't really like russians . 
  maybe not really as in * the russian people * , but we definitely do n't like their leaders . 
  well ... the first and most obvious impact was the communist regime they imposed and left behind . 
  even if ceausescu did n't exactly follow urss and actually criticized it when he refused to involve romania in the invasion of czechoslovakia , he was fascinated by north korea 's regime , so that was n't exactly good either . 
  then , when communism fell , people were obviously confused so romania sat for quite a while in a neo communism state , with guys from the communist regime still leading . 
  after 50 years of communism , many bad things remained . 
  corruption was and is still the biggest battle for us . 
  there are some old people who still long for the communist times , but most people would never go back to that . 
  it 's funny because serbia is our neighbour country . 
  we do n't really know much about them , but they have guns so we do n't fuck with them . 
  well ^ i ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ hope ^ ^ ^ ^ france ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remembers ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we 're ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ their ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ bros, 
  well i would have loved to visit the uk again ( yes , as a tourist ) , but i do n't want to get stabbed ^ ^ / s ^ ^ kinda, 
  canada sounds great except it 's cold . . australia sounds fun except i 'd get eaten . 
  or worse ... i 'd see a giant spider in my house and become homeless . 
  in the end i 'd just suck it and move to canada . 
  or maybe san francisco . 
   article 1  ( 1 ) romania is a sovereign , independent , unitary and indivisible national state . 
   ( 2 ) the form of government of the romanian state is a republic . 
   ( 3 ) romania is a democratic and social state , governed by the rule of law , in which human dignity , the citizens ' rights and freedoms , the free development of human personality , justice and political pluralism represent supreme values , in the spirit of the democratic traditions of the romanian people and the ideals of the revolution of december 1989 , and shall be guaranteed . 
   ( 4 ) the state shall be organized based on the principle of the separation and balance of powers - legislative , executive , and judicial-within the framework of constitutional democracy . 
   ( 5 ) in romania , the observance of the constitution , its supremacy and the laws shall be mandatory . 
  i find that spanish is the easiest to learn and understand , but no , i will not automatically understand something a spanish person says to me . 
  sure , i could probably figure out some words and maybe figure out the sentence in the end , but they 're still different languages . 
  anyway , like i said , from my point of view , spanish seems the easiest to learn . 
  1 . people to stop voting for the same idiots 2 . politicians to start actually caring about this country and the people 3 . continue the fight against corruption 4 . find ways to stop the pollution . 
  bucharest is polluted af 5 . idiots to stop trying to destroy our forests 6 . work on the economy more , create better living conditions 7 . get better infrastructure 8 . make the education system better 9 . equal rights for minorities ( such as lgbt ) way more probably but these just came to mind, 
  idiots keep electing corrupt idiots i am running out of patience, 
  well i mean the us did just put some missile shields in our country and we 're currently having a quite good nato relationship with them , but trump might change that . 
   how do you define this term , e.g. 
  through geography , culture , history or smth else ? 
  countries that used to be behind the iron curtain  does your country belong to eastern europe ? 
  yes , but geographically , we are south eastern . 
  we 're balkan . 
  we 're also surrounded by slavs . 
  except for the hungarians . 
  new europe . 
  lol . 
  i 'd love to meet * cool * people , but not for sex or relationship purposes . 
  i just want someone to drink with and laugh . 
  generally , i used to frequent rock bars mostly and people usually go there to just have fun with their friends . 
  you do meet a few people , more than half are pissed drunk , and some may even get laid , but the main reason is to have fun with friends i think . 
  it was an invasion based on bush 's propaganda . 
  bush lied to the public about iraq and wmds in a time when everyone was still emotional about 9/11 . 
  and this memo between bush and blair is particularly gross :  it has become controversial for its content , which includes discussing ways to provoke saddam hussein into a confrontation , with bush floating the idea of painting a u-2 spyplane in united nations colors and letting it fly low over iraq to provoke iraq into shooting it down , thus providing a pretext for america and britain 's subsequent invasion . 
   it also shows george bush and tony blair making a secret deal to carry out the invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were discovered by un weapons inspectors , in direct contradiction to statements made by blair to parliament afterwards that saddam would be given a final chance to disarm . 
  rich and drunk .
