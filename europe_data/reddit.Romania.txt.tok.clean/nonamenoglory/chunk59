  what more could you ask, 
  there 's enough swearing around here for everyone else * fuck your mom 's onion *, 
  spreading out more awareness to the british public about how hate crimes will not be tolerated in the least , no matter how they feel about these people . 
  punishments should also be a bit harsher because there 's a difference between say , beating up someone because you want to take their money ( which is impersonal and does not have the potential of creating a hate movement ) and beating up someone because they come from a place that is hated by the abuser or because they have a certain skin color . 
  i believe that being hard on hate crimes from the very beginning sends a very clear message that this will not be allowed to happen without grave consequences . 
  i know that this wo n't take the hate from people , education will , but before education , which is a longer process , the safety of people comes first . 
  just curious ... do we have to wait for uk 's statistics of hate crimes specifically against immigrants to become very huge to take any actions ? 
  because crimes are crimes and they get punished , but hate crimes are different and they 're motivated by hate against certain people so why is uk not spreading out more and more tolerant messages to its citizens ? 
  and they do n't even have to wait for the crimes . 
  the fact that , for example , polish people received cards to with `` polish vermin '' written on them is alarming , especially since we have cases that prove people do n't limit themselves to words or ugly gestures , but to physical violence and even murder in certain cases . 
  also , they could be taking measures to prevent any possible rise in the future and make it clear that crimes , especially hate crimes that target people by their ethnicity or nationality , will not be tolerated in the least . 
   it is a shocking event if a stranger holds a door open for you ? 
  nope . 
   tries to start a conversation old people start conversations with me sometimes . 
  i do n't always mind them , but sometimes i really do n't know what to say . 
  i 'm polite though and will suffer through one sided awkwardness when i do n't know what to say , but i do n't particularly enjoy these times . 
  however , i do enjoy a good conversation even if it 's with a stranger sometimes . 
  i think it depends on the mood of the person and the timing . 
  you have to learn to read if someone 's interested in actually talking to you . 
  what also matters is the topic . 
  if you ask personal questions , people who do n't know you are n't always willing to just share with you whatever personal thing you ask . 
  ( the difference of answer to a `` how are you ? '', 
  questions varies from `` fine '' aka i 'm fine or i do n't know you well enough to tell you or i am not interested in doing small talk and actually detailing your mood or situation . 
  this is what the polish person in the thread is referring to by saying that you guys do n't want a real answer . 
  and in all honesty , if a stranger asks me how i am , i ca n't just start talking about , say , my problems to them . 
  especially when they 're just making small talk . 
  so i 'll give a short or fake answer and try to move on . ), 
  and remember that the concept of personal details , personal subjects , etc. 
  depends on the the person you 're speaking with . 
  something that you do n't think is personal might be personal for someone else . 
  it 's a cultural thing i guess , but i 'm sure not everyone is as cold to strangers as you think . 
  it 's both a cultural and personality wise sort of thing . 
  timisoreana is cheap and good also , this reminds me of the fact that i enjoy the dutch heineken but apparently people consider it piss so i guess i drink piss once in a while, 
  funny , `` prost '' means stupid in romanian but means `` cheers '' in german . 
  close to nothing . 
  i think i brought a book or two once , but they were n't expensive . 
  the rest we got from library , for free or via internet . 
  private university though so idk what happens at the public ones . 
  is it because it 's dutch or is it because it 's considered bad ? 
  sorry i do n't get this lol, 
  nothing bothered me so far about tourists , but the ones that stand out the most are the brits . 
  usually drunk and loud . 
  but i think that the brits i usually see like that are football fans . 
  kind of the same here too, 
  we should have been in schengen for quite a while now . 
  ~ ~ why you like this netherlands ?? 
   anti-russia ** most ** people do ** not ** like russia , especially young people , but there are some who do like russia . 
  some are afraid of russia . 
  however , i 've heard of no incidents with russian toursits or so . 
  so i do n't think there 's an open display of hate towards them . 
   anti chinese seriously never heard someone talk badly about them , but that 's just a personal experience . 
  there are quite a lot of chinese people in romania . 
  i 've had quite a few chinese neighbours myself . 
  they 're usually nice people . 
  as for china , people just know that everything is produced in china and that a lot of things produced in china tend to have a low quality . 
  but there 's no hard feelings . 
  at least i do n't think so . 
   anti-american most people like americans . 
  there are those who do n't , for various reasons , but they 're generally liked around here . 
  as for the u.s. , things are a bit more complicated than what i 've said above . 
  due to the recent installment of the anti defense missile , opinions vary . 
  those who like russia obviously tend to dislike the us and view the us as an entity who tries to get into everyone 's business and start shit and stuff like that , but there are also those who are n't sure if they 're okay with the defense system because they 're afraid of russia doing something rash . 
  those are people who usually want our country to stay neutral and as far from conflicts as possible . 
  there are also those who welcome the american support for our country and i think they are the biggest crowd . 
  pretty cheap , yeah . 
  here 's the official website : http://www.comic-con.ro/, 
  eastern european comic con in romania . 
  well all i can tell you is that there 's mostly traditional folks in the country side so they can seem a bit odd to someone coming from an urban foreign area . 
  like with any other place you would go , you have to be a bit careful , but like i said , this applies to any new place you 're visiting . 
  late to the party , but i 'll tell you what i think on one side , a lot of people feel relieved when we get help from the west and the us because we 're quite close to russia and quite close to crimea . 
  history has proven us that our geopolitical position sucks ( russia vs west , russia vs usa ) . 
  while some people are relieved , others feel scared . 
  scared because while they want to be safe from russia , they fear more military bases , more troops , etc. 
  will anger russia and they might do something rash . 
  granted , we know that romania is part of nato and if russia ever attacks , nato countries are obliged to react and help us . 
  i 'm just saying what i think by the way i heard some people speak about it . 
  personally , i wish russia would chill and us would have no reason to be here . 
  generally a lot of people like americans ( yesterday it was a pre 4th of july ceremony here with our president and the us ambassador ) , but some remember how after ww2 we were invaded by the russians and no one did a thing , so they 're a bit bitter . 
  i am aware and i 'm not a troll . 
  i was asking if it could affect nato in any way . 
  you really do not need to be rude . 
  if you do n't have an answer , you do n't need to reply . 
  scotland could call for a independence referendum and join the eu, 
  is this the story of how you voted for brexit ? 
  thank you . 
  i guess it is a bit harder because of the slavic influence . 
  honestly , i think spanish would be the easiest to learn . 
  there are words and phrases i just understand without looking them up . 
  it is also easier to speak than , say , french . 
  off topic : had french classes when i was in school ( kids usually learn english and french here , french because we 're francophone ) , but i had a hard time learning it . 
  got ta admit , this is partly due to my disinterest back then and due to pretentious teachers . 
  one teacher in particular , i remember even now , i was trying to read a text in french and she told me my reading is awful because i use an english accent . 
  she hated english so much and praised french a lot . 
  but at least i got to learn all of the pronunciation rules because she was the type of teacher to give you a very bad mark if you messed up pronunciation . 
  kind of made me lose interest in french as a language back then , but i think i 'd be hyped if i were to pick it up now , as an adult . 
  it 's a beautiful language , but it 's a hard language and as a child , i 've never imaged myself being able to speak it . 
  i 'm sure of that . 
  i 've mentioned that because it is easier for me to learn spanish than say german , but i think english is universally easier to learn for europeans . 
  maybe it 's also because it 's used in every country . 
  there 's also the aspect of media .
