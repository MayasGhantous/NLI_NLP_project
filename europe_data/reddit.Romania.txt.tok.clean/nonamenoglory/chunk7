  the americans of europe . 
  so when that happens to eastern europe , do you stand up against it ? 
  do you say it 's hate instead of banter ? 
  i have no intention whatsoever to take you seriously so you 're safe from my * fooling *, 
  oh man ... you 're so out of touch with reality , it 's hilarious . 
   romanian archbishop teodosie , who heads the orthodox church in constanta county , in eastern romania , is investigated for taking bribes and using false statements to obtain eu funds . 
  the prosecutors placed him under judicial control for 60 days on monday , october 17 . 
   five other people are being investigated in this case . 
   prosecutors from the national anticorruption directorate ( dna ) say that , between 2010 and 2016 , archbishop teodosie and the other suspects used and submitted false declarations to the agency for payments and intervention in agriculture ( apia ) to obtain eu funds . 
   in these statements , they declared that wine grapes were being cultivated on some land plots , although those cultures did n't exist anymore . 
  moreover , they also said that they complied with the good agricultural and environmental conditions ( gaec ) during their agricultural activities , as well as with the statutory management requirements ( rms ) on the environment , public , animal and plant health . 
   following these false declarations , the defendants obtained total eu funds of over ron 1.35 million ( some eur 300,000 ) , according to dna . 
  the payments for 2016 have n't been authorized yet . 
   moreover , archbishop teodosie is also being accused of taking a eur 500 bribe from a person . 
  in return , the archbishop ordered that the individual in question would receive legal remuneration for the work he was carrying out in a parish . 
   during the period in which he is under judicial control , the archbishop will have to go to the prosecuting authority or the court whenever he is asked to do so , to announce if he plans to change his residence , and not to talk with the other suspects . 
   a tory councillor campaigner is calling on parliament to make supporting eu membership a criminal offence under treason laws . 
  * muh sovereignty * . 
  mister , pls , do n't rain on my parade, 
   romania supports the faster advancement of the file concerning the european public prosecutor 's office ( eppo ) , according to a release by the justice ministry sent to agerpres , after the participation of minister raluca pruna ( photo ) in the works of the justice home affairs council in luxembourg . 
   `` the justice ministers talked about the current situation and the path to follow as regards the regulation on the european public prosecutor 's office and the directive regarding the fight against fraud that affects the eu financial interests through the criminal law . 
  romania appreciates the efforts of the presidency to finalise the text of the regulation on the european public prosecutor 's office , and backs the faster advancement of this file , as it has so far done , '' says the release . 
   talks on this topic will further at technical level , within the working groups at expert level , adds the source . 
   on the side-lines of the meeting , minister raluca pruna met her counterparts from austria , denmark and estonia . 
  honestly i have no idea , but i 'm gon na go with bulgarian or russian . 
  pretty good considering you 're not a native . 
  and you probably do n't know romanian . 
  haha . 
  is your native language slavic ?

  or maybe what / u/bobama123 wrote . 
  how dare you sir , the blood of trajan runs through my veins !!!, 
  1 . why the downvote . 
  2 . why do you change flags every other day . 
  would you look at that . 
  neither poor , nor gypsy . 
  well someone did say the bouncers were the visegrad 4 so ... it was an easy job really . 
  finland and sweden , what a love story . 
  oh my god, 
  ** romania : ** no illegal business y' all . 
  ** also romania : ** * gets into a fight with russia and hungary , cries over ex girlfriend moldova , steals uk 's job as the bartender and drinks everything from the bar until it passes out . 
  not before it manages to upload embarrassing photos of the rest on facebook while everyone else is cursing the bad wifi *, 
  oh man , this gets more awkward with each day, 
  well , that 's not what this is , is it ? 
  1 . not the only romanian in the comment section 2 . the only romanian in the comment section to use romanian 3 . if they really wanted to know this specific romanian 's opinion on a picture with snow , they could have translated it via google or even ask me to translate , but i doubt that would be the case here so while i understand your frustration if a comment section on an * article * is * all * in a language other than english and therefore can not be understood without google translate and/or the help of the commentator , this is not , fortunately , one of those cases . 
  i mostly do . 
  like 99.9 % of the time . 
  i 'm not sure anyone else beside you , other romanians , are upset about this specific , untranslated , unworthy of drama comment . 
  why so serious ? 
  chill . 
  you do n't say, 
  gen 20-25 grade everyday . 
  she 's definitely prone to conflict and supports military intervention . 
  that 's why i always said that yeah , trump 's a twat , but tread carefully with hillary too . 
  yeah but it 's local news is n't it ? 
  it 's so late my laugh came with a delay, 
   the way i see it right now is that romania and bulgaria stand in the way of canada getting a fta with actual important european countries while canada could likely give two shits about a fta with romania and bulgaria . 
  sorry bud , you deal with the eu , not with uk , germany , france , italy , spain , greece and maybe poland . 
  someway , somehow , someone 's always going to complain about * those countries * . 
  that 's not true . 
  visa treaty is to avoid a veto from romania so it comes first . 
  our government denied the 2018 option and there are talks of 2017 now . 
  `` why did n't the remain side step up and try harder '' oh my god this is so pathetic . 
  there were people shouting stuff , there were experts shouting stuff ... idk i ca n't feel bad for people who did n't realize the importance of this vote and they either did n't vote or did n't know what they voted for and now regret it . 
  it was probably because of the refugee crisis . 
  hopefully things sort out over time . 
  no they were n't so i wonder why is hungary in this situation ? 
  do they not like the eu at all ? 
  yeah , it 's shocking and i honestly do n't understand what they want at this point : russia or eu ? 
  in the end , if it really is the people 's will , you can not deny their will . 
  and i do n't think hungary has more reason to hate russia than romania . 
  nah , you do n't get to say something like that without sources . 
   but it proves my point a bit , that the west did write us off on a piece of paper , and it will do it again . 
  yes they did but the dynamics have changed . 
  if it 's proven that they 'd do it again , i 'd be the first to vote against eu or nato or whatever else cause what would be the point , really . 
  i also agree that hitler did n't do much for us either and that even if the outcome of ww2 was shit for us , it could have been worse , considering germany 's post war plans in case of victory . 
   i do n't want to defend the regime , as there 's nothing to defend . 
  i do view it as a legitimate part of our history though , which can not be erased ( for better or for worse ) . 
  doing otherwise only dehumanizes millions of romanians who lived their lives searching for happiness , including my family . 
  i understand that , my family went through it too . 
  and i do n't deny romania 's active participation in the holocaust . 
  however , the situation was still different in these two countries . 
  romania was never the machine that germany was and romanians were not as aware as the germans were . 
  it was a fucked up time nonetheless , there 's no denying in that . 
  both romania and germany fucked up . 
   and i did n't say we 'll believe that russia is a good ally . 
  all i said is that we 'll end up allies with them again . 
  i 'm still not buying into this though . 
  what would be the case ? 
  did you have any other choice in ww2 ? 
  were you spared of the punishments of being on the german side ? 
  romania was the only country in the eastern sphere to get a 90 % soviet influence post ww2 . 
  even germany got rid of the soviets and of communism earlier than us . 
  and they got help in becoming the developing country they are today . 
  we did n't want to be in ww2 to begin with but we ended up on russia 's side because they occupied our country . 
  there was nothing else to be done . 
  romania 's entry in ww2 was a coup and a mistake . 
  none of these times we were allied with russia did we want and actually believed in russia to be a good ally . 
  why should n't every member of the union have a say in it ? 
  why is this on the europe sub ?
