bad timing , everyone was sleeping 5 hours ago . 
  also , portugal got roasted once again . 
  romania is a romance language speaking country in a sea of slavic countries so maybe that ? 
  \u021aigania to be accurate, 
  * pats his back on his way out * there there , you 'll get used to it . 
  please , this conversation is only for eu countries . 
  * shows him the way out *, 
  nah , do n't worry , it was just a joke regarding how destroyed you guys get in these `` what x ask about y '' posts , haha . 
  you 'd be surprised how many people genuinely think that romania was named after the gypsies . 
  sorry forgot to make the / s more obvious, 
  shut up `` poor '', 
   the romani or roma , are a traditionally itinerant ethnic group , living mostly in europe and the americas and originating from the northern regions of the indian subcontinent , presumably from where the states rajasthan , haryana , and punjab exist today . 
  the romani are widely known among english-speaking people by the exonym `` gypsies '' ( or `` gipsies '' ) , which some people consider controversial due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity . 
  romani are dispersed , with their concentrated populations in europe -- especially central , eastern and southern europe including turkey , spain and southern france . 
  and  romania derives from the latin romanus , meaning `` citizen of rome '' . 
  the first known use of the appellation was attested in the 16th-century by italian humanists travelling in transylvania , moldavia , and wallachia . 
  yeah , sorry but no . 
  they 're latin, 
  ** norway for the nords !, 
  ** wait what ? 
  do n't get too excited . 
  that 's not dragonsreach, 
  [ ok , who changed our flag without saying anything ? 
   more corrupt than us . 
  ** double triggered !, 
  codruta show yourself !,

  du du duuuuuu, 
  working for a private company now . 
  where 's the noun in that definition ? 
  you 're making it too easy . 
  this has 26 upvotes and the other news has 65 ( tho i agree it should be discussed more ) . 
  so if you 're going to make a point , at least do n't be a retard . 
  i am not in charge of finding it and my personal ideas might be subjective . 
  eu has to find a proper and working solution, 
  i should 've pointed out that not any law . 
  and terrorists usually break the law , as we all saw many of them doing so in the past . 
  for starters check for criminal recrod if available . 
  then expatriate them if they brake the law in any kind . 
  also , keep track of all the immigrants . 
  and if someone wants to argue that this is way too right-winged and racist , remember that this is still common legislation for those who come from other countries even if they only come for tourism . 
  i am aware . 
  guess what , it was done late and it will only work for a few months . 
  this is not a proper solution . 
  ok but for how long are we going to ignore that more of them can infiltrate along with innocent civilians ? 
  how many others have to die until the eu starts getting some control ? 
  this is what we get for being too liberal , and i 'm center-left oriented . 
  i mean seriously , what the fuck is wrong with europe right now !, 
  why are they getting in so easily after what happened ?!, 
  i 've spent 2 years trying to move to spain from romania , with paperwork and all that stuff and they are getting in so goddamn easily that it fucking hurts !, 
  seeking asylum ? 
  apply for it and wait in the goddamn immigrant camp !, 
  this comment might be deleted , because people around here are against nationalist , right-wing people , but i am too , this is just purely the truth no one wants to see , and more importantly , solve !, 
  erm , [ this is not relevant anymore ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/eu-leaders-reach-outline-of-deal-with-turkey-to-resolve-migration-crisis/a-19100674 ), 
  they would get stuck in greece anyway because turkey would get the money and send even more with some all-of-a-sudden excuse, 
  oh , let 's let her free then , right ? 
  get out of europe now !, 
  lol, 
  i have no clue how many clients are there but i would guess ~ 200, 
  same in romanian ; olanda & tarile de jos, 
  i live in a village ( pop . 
  ~ 1000 ) in northen romania , in the heart of the carpathian mountains . 
  closest big city is baia mare , @ 200km i 've got fiber internet ; 500mbps for 10 $ / month, 
  we still have our declinations ? 
  where are yours , huh ? 
  i live in arag\u00f3n and i 'm with movistar . 
  i pay 50 $ / mth for 30mbps , i get 10 ( ofc 200kbps upload only ) . 
  i pay for 30 but because coverage is shit i only get 10 , and that 's rough and shitty . 
  all the companies use the same infrastructure , thus they offer the same shit . 
  they 're rolling out fiber but all of them together so it 'll be shit afterwards too . 
  in romania each company has their own infrastructure , thus , they can offer better deals . 
  and fuck jazztell and their constant calls and smss, 
  no apoi \u0219\u00ee ieu a\u0219\u0103 am z\u00ees . 
  some people are saying that this footage is not from munich .

   and finally - which is the only eu state which has n't been a correct answer in this quiz ? 
  what a way to insinuate uk should leave the eu,

  cheers, 
  people still do n't get that we only became a proper country in 1989 . 
  there are still a lot of rural areas with poorly educated people with communist values and the church is just starting to lose power . 
  those who signed are people above 40 , living in villages , and they signed it at church after a lecture on how allowing gay people to get married will bring the apocalypse . 
  the fact that 3 mln uneducated people blindly signed a stupid petition does n't mean that the remaining 17 mln agree with it aswell . 
   men and women,
