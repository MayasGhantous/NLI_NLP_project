  what 's that reference from ? 
   unity yeah , no . 
  found it . 
  cheers, 
  missed that then . 
  still you do n't get the real situation . 
  they were offered jobs , all their children are in school but they refuse it . 
  kids just abandon studies http://adevarul.ro/locale/buzau/romii-refuzat-locurile-rezervate-colegii-1_50ac974e7c42d5a663866221/index.html , adults refuse jobs http://www.stiridecluj.ro/economic/zeci-de-tigani-de-la-pata-rat-dusi-sa-se-angajeze-pentru-1-050-de-lei-pe-luna-nu-muncim and so on and so forth . 
  the issue is not as plain as you get it on your feed , there 's way more to it . 
  and keep in mind that romania still has a minimum wage below 400 $ which is low for anybody , so they just chose to go abroad and steal/beg/prostitue . 
  and yeah if you check news and statistics you 'll see this is true , not just the whole country being racist against them . 
  where do you know it has n't ? 
  they were offered school , education , everything . 
  most of them refuse jobs because they 're picky and you ca n't force them , can you ? 
  that 's how they are and that 's not our fault . 
  by the way , there are gypsies in other countries too , i.e. 
  in spain they were prosecuted during franco and forced to integrate thus stopped being nomad and settled down , but they still leave in separate neighbourhoods , they still cause some trouble ( specially the young ones ) and they are still not fully integrated . 
  gypsies were nomads since forever , we are not `` exporting '' them, 
  as someone mentioned below , op is not romanian, 
  says the one from spain ? 
  did you check a corruption index recently ? 
  spain is almost as corrupt as romania and we are the ones protesting against it , so please take your preponderance elsewhere . 
  just you wait, 
  i really wish i could find a picture on the internet of that poster all over the place , but eh , you do n't have to believe me if you do n't want to . 
  still , insisting that reino the arag\u00f3n is actually corona catalano-aragonesa is really not [ * a piece of anectodal stuff with no evidence at all * ] ( http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/aragon/la_corona_catalanoaragonesa_que_nunca_existio.html ), 
  oh come on , what a drama queen you are . 
  i tend to use english or native terms when there 's not a translation when i 'm talking in english . 
  and arag\u00f3 is neither english nor native , as opposed to lleida which is native . 
  maybe you should [ take a look at this article ] ( http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/cuestiones-de-bilingismo-y-diglosia-en-el-espaol-0/html/00effb3a-82b2-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_11.html ) also , fyi , pat\u00faes is considered a [ transition dialect ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/patu%c3%a9s ) , and this applies for chapurriau aswell . 
  they 're not dialects of catalan only , neither entire new languages . 
  yet , calling them catalan is wrong . 
  yeah , [ me and the rae ] ( http://dle.rae.es/?id=7qluxx1 ), 
  while i agree with the fact that the differences are almost insignificant , there are still grammar differences and that removes its dialect `` status '' which does not happen with valencian or balearic . 
  it 's a mix , as i said , and the percentages are different in every region of la franja . 
  oh , and by the way , you mean arag\u00f3n . 
  flaix fm once put up posters for an event taking place in `` monts\u00f3 , lleida '' ( aka monz\u00f3n , huesca ) . 
  and well , you know , the whole corona catalano-aragonesa fiasco . 
  - arogances like these make people from arag\u00f3n hate the catalan independentist movement . 
  small edit  [ ... ] the differences between what they speak there and what is spoken in barcelona , val\u00e8ncia or mallorca are way smaller than the differences between what 's spoken in madrid and lima , cancun , buenos aires , etc. 
  i want to point out that there is a difference between castellano and espa\u00f1ol aswell . 
  too bad that la franja does n't actually speak catalan but what they call chapurriau . 
  i live there so i should know . 
  edit : i know this because i live nearby , not in the area directly . 
  but locals do n't consider it catalan , at least most of them do n't , even if it is sort of a dialect . 
  edit2 : i want to explain myelf a bit more ; yes , chapurriau has a lot of influence from catalan but also from aragon\u00e9s , occitane and castellano . 
  in fact , around benasque they speak patu\u00e9s , which is a variation of chapurriau but with more influence from aragon\u00e9s . 
  neither are a dialect of catalan since there are gramatic differences aswell , thus making them almost like separate languages . 
  this one is made by bromania . 
  the other one was made by cronica carcotasilor, 
  nothing new under the sun . 
  same rethoric on both sides . 
  driving from romania to spain through germany we crossed the border near dijon and instead of going towards lyon we went towards st. ettiene and then montpellier , and that 's where the bridge is . 
  sources say a crater was formed in the ground and he arose from it in a cloud of fog and light saying with a deafening voice : `` did you miss me ? '', 
  ** update : ** we have an official reaction from the government , and i quote : `` oh , shit '', 
  what are you implying ?

  300.000 in bucharest . 
  22:15 : digi 24 reports ~ 600.000 across the country !, 
  [ update !, 
  a hooligan managed to break the gendarme line and he 's going for the building !!!, 
  i totally agree , and to point out , i was creating the post at the same time as the others but posted it later because i got more pictures . 
  as i said , if there 's a need to , i will delete mine . 
  i will happily delete it if needed but since albums are way easier to navigate on reddit than comments , i decided to post it as a thread . 
  ( those with res can relate ), 
  [ live feed ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/live/digi24 ) ** sorry for the repost ** but i managed to capture a few more shots of it . 
  [ 400.000 at 20:38 ] ( https://imgur.com/sa0kr7y ) all across the country . 
  220.000 in bucharest . 
  i really think that after the second day there should 've been a megathread with updates and stuff regarding the situation in romania instead of threads after threads after threads spamming the frontpage of the subreddit . 
  i think no one in / r/europe calls romanian gypsies or similar sorts anymore , and those who do are just trolling . 
  and this applies to real life too . 
  there 's no need to repeat the same speech every single time , and there is no need to be patronising others . 
  you think so ? 
  yes , most probably . 
  live feed from [ digi24 ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/live/digi24 ), 
  protesters in bucharest will make a human chain around the palace of parliament . 
  careful , he also basically blatantly stated that he ca n't stop the pressure from other psd supporters from inside the country to protest against * those manipulated these days to take the streets * , announcing a counter-protest with 1.000.000 psd supporters and blaming the president for the entire situation . 
  the level of arrogance and disrespect against the current protesters and the promise of repealing eo13 are ** meant to reduce the strength of the protests announced for tonight and tomorrow ** where more than 500.000 people are expected all across the country . 
  i stand corrected then . 
  bucharest was at 150k this time aswell . 
  thank you, 
  we are proud of those on the streets and we thank the pression from outside aswell !, 
  huge protests , no violence . 
  great civic spirit !, 
  i personally hope to see this all around the world and specially europe whenever it 's needed !, 
  thank you !, 
  everyone is awaiting an answer . 
  all the odds say the decree will be declared unconstitutional but no one trusts anyone anymore . 
  afaik there were n't these many people protesting ( not fighting ) at the revolution !, 
  edit : [ 100.000 people were protesting on the 21st of december , after the events in timisoara , the day ceausescu fled to targoviste . ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_revolution ) . 
  there are more than 320.000 now all across the country !, 
  weakens * sorry . 
  the numbers are still rising .

  edit : sources inform that at 22:00 ( 20:00 gmt ) , protesters in all main cities will start singing together the national anthem . 
  [ live feed from digi24 here ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/live/digi24 ) edit : 300.000 people protesting all across the country at 22:00 !, 
  the number raises from yesterday 's 240.000 and even more are expected tomorrow and on sunday . 
  edit 3 : 320.000 at 22:20, 
  fair enough , although i do n't see it as such since i 'm not supporting any party in particular , but the fight for a proper democracy , but i can understand your call . 
  i only found one for montreal but since facebook is about geolocalization it 's easier for people living around those big cities to find them .
