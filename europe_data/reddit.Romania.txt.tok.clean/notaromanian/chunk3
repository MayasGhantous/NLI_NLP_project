  sadly / r/europe does n't allow links from facebook so i ca n't post it . 
  i really have no clue but afaik the protests are organised on facebook for the most part so looking around there for groups and events could be useful . 
  some smaller , some bigger , but constant in most big cities where romanians live . 
  edit : [ relevant ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/externe/ue/sute-de-romani-au-protestat-si-in-diaspora-fata-de-situatia-din-tara-661397 ) edit : apart from these more are announced for the following days , in luxembourg , helsinki , dublin and belfast . 
  of course they do n't because they got too deep to be able to climb out . 
  we need to keep fighting , all the odds are on our side and they wo n't get away with it . 
  it also makes some psd supporters really think `` who is actually right in this situation ? '', 
  and even people inside psd start realising that this whole situation is wrong , and this is breaking it from the inside . 
  the news are not fake neither fabricated . 
  the interviewer posted the entire interview . 
  what the eu can do and actually does is putting pression over the government . 
  and i really think that makes a huge difference since romania is not eurosceptic at all and all these warnings from the eu and from the commerce associations and embassies are really helping the movement . 
  small turnout , and they have their own dedicated voters, 
  the numbers will surely rise but as of now ( 20:16 gmt +2 ) 80.000 people are on the streets , from which 30.000 in bucharest in front of the government building . 
  ** a bit of context ( copied from yesterday 's thread by u/magicsebi who explained the situation quite well ) **  < < < context    : under the pretext that the european court of human rights mentioned our prisons are getting crowded , the government passed an emergency ordnance late last night * . 
  this ordnance made it so that abuse of office is not considered a crime if the damages are below $ 48,000 . 
  it also modifies the penal code so that denunciations can only be made within 6 months after the fact , which makes it harder to fight crime , corruption , terrorism or drug-trafficking . 
  nepotism is also allowed now !, 
  thousands of corrupt people , politicians and moguls will be pardoned through this ordnance . 
  also , any illegal activity committed through a normative act is no longer illegal ( this ordnance included ! ) . 
  * note : an emergency ordnance is passed almost immediately , but since they modified the penal code too , it takes 10 days at a minimum to come into effect so there 's a chance to fight it what 's new : * [ psd leader dragnea and prime minister grindeanu finally made a press conference after missing the whole of yesterday , preceded by a national psd meeting , where they accused the media of manipulation and spreading false facts and announced that the decree will not be abolished . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the `` jandarmeria '' are not hurting people fighting the goverment . 
  they are doing their job which consists of taking care the protest does n't get out of control , instigators do n't start a massive fight , and public buildings are protected . 
  there was no one inside the building at the time of the protest , it 's symbolic . 
  they 're protecting the people the same way they protect the government . 
  i agree i should 've used a more appropiate word for it, 
  these images are cherrypicked for the sake of sensationalism . 
  the protest was peaceful until some hooligans showed up a few hours later . 
   a baton or truncheon ( also called a cosh , billystick , billy club , nightstick , sap , blackjack , stick ) is a club of less than arm 's length made of wood , rubber , plastic or metal . 
  they are carried for self-defense by law-enforcement officers , correctional staff , security-industry employees and military personnel . 
  other uses for truncheons and batons include crowd control or the dispersal of belligerent or non-compliant people . 
  a nightstick, 
  romania is part of the international organisation of la francophonie [ link ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/map-francophonie_organisation_fr.svg ), 
  europe in general has such a nice architecture . 
  100k bucharest , 80k all other cities . 
  and it just started . 
  my grandma used to have rusty brown kettles too . 
  also , it 's fun to have a shitpost session from time to time . 
  never too exagerated tho . 
  dude , i do n't know where you live but this was pretty big two years ago when the it got out into the light . 
  you can do more research and you 'll find it everywhere . 
  of course , you just noticed the links and not what i said after them , how things really are next to catalonia so i wo n't bother anymore . 
  you 're pretty stuck on one idea and you wo n't see otherwise . 
  edit : [ want more ] ( http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/aragon/2016/09/01/y-vuelta-mula-trigo-con-corona-catalano-aragonesa-1037109-300.html ) [ links ? 
  ] ( http://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/noticias/aragon/aliaga-critica-generalitat-hable-corona-catalanoaragonesa-folleto_1138383.html ), 
  [ erm ] ( http://www.abc.es/local-aragon/20131007/abci-generalitat-catalana-mentiras-201310070522.html ) [ erm ] ( http://esradio.libertaddigital.com/fonoteca/2016-11-01/una-madre-catalana-consigue-que-un-profesor-rectifique-106731.html ) [ erm ] ( https://www.inh.cat/articles/la-corona-catalano-aragonesa ) it 's not just `` crazy people '' when the generalitat speaks of it using official mediums . 
  believe me , i live in monz\u00f3n , and we do n't even speak chapurreao in this area but i 've seen posters and similar items including monz\u00f3n ( monts\u00f3 as they call it ) into the province of lleida . . come on , it may not be obvious from barcelona or anywhere on the coast but the situation here is not crap madrid sells . 
  any exception would rule the constitution useless . 
  that 's not the way . 
  catalonia can start a referendum on it but it will only be consultative and the spanish government has to then accept it if they want to . 
  it 's not that easy to abandon ship , and even less when you 're so aggresive about it . 
  what i hate about catalonia 's fiasco is how they change history books and corona de arag\u00f3n changes to corona catalanoaragonesa or some bullshit like that , and i wo n't even go in the `` la franja '' dispute and the copious amount of lies the generalitat spews out to manipulate those who 're in the dark . 
  you expect to be understood but you lie and manipulate everything . 
  not really . 
  orthodox christmas is on the 7th of january for those countries who still follow the julian calendar . 
  we use the western one , and there are more orthodox countries which use the gregorian calendar, 
  we do n't celebrate santa claus either , we celebrate saint nicholas and `` old man christmas '' , the first orthdox and on the 6th of december and the second from the nords on christmas day . 
  still the purely christmasy one ( to put it in a strict sense ) is old man christmas . 
  i am fully aware of that . 
  i 'm just saying that any other day than december 25th is not christmas anymore , even tho the festivities keep on going until after reyes magos . 
  and this map is about christmas giftbringers . 
  but los reyes magos do n't bring christmas presents , they come in january , so your point is invalid since the chart is about `` christmas giftbringers of europe '', 
  also keep in mind that maramures has almost no urban population except for baia mare and sighet , and everyone living in villages usually go to church in the morning . 
  indeed, 
  need any help emptying it ? 
  pretty sure that 's french . 
  pollo = chicken . 
  not the same word, 
  guys , stop playing cities skylines with your country, 
  of course all of this is just a conspiracy theory . 
  unless you have proof of everything you mentioned above , it remains a theory . 
  salou is aragon 's anyway, 
  but you have to agree that most of those living in northen europe were preaching for their freedom and saving them and so on and so forth when the ones dealing with the shit were the southern countries . 
  to be honest this is not really how the average class in romania looks . 
  you are aware that democracy is not just `` what people vote '' . 
  the separation of power is as important as the representation . 
  i think it means no game spy arcade, 
  it happened a few times to me sadly whenever i went to calle mayor in lleida ( where all the shops are ) . 
  i just go to zaragoza now . 
  i mean it could be pretty isolated and based on region . 
  one time , flaix fm organised a party in monz\u00f3n ( huesca ) and on the leaflets they printed it as monts\u00f2 ( lleida ) . 
  living in arag\u00f3n on the border with catalonia i can tell you there are 2 obvious sides there , and the pro-independence side is more toxic than the unionist side . 
  i just love it when i go to lleida ( living in the huesca province ) and i speak castellano in a shop and they insist on replying in catalan . 
  i usually just walk away if they keep doing it with everything i bought left on the counter , but it really grinds my gears . 
  edit : go ahead , downvote me as you wish . 
  next time i 'll record it . 
  wait , i know hungary uses the forint but if they do n't use the euro how can they be in the eurozone ? 
  that 's wrong , right ? 
  to impeach him psd needa 50 % +1 votes in the parliament and then a referendum is triggered, 
  iohannis does n't want to deepen the situation so if the parties propose a decent pm backed by a majority in the parliament he will nominate him/her and the parliament will accept it, 
  that can happen twice . 
  the third time means elections . 
  it sounds like a scottish person trying to cheer usa, 
  well there has n't been an opinion poll recently but he infuriated a lot of his nationalist voters by trying to make a deal with udmr ( hungarian minority party ) , an unpleasing deal . 
  it 's speculation but still safe to assume some votes were lost, 
  yep . 
  that is indeed how it works . 
   very popular , a referendum will be held and probably will be rejected  i never said a referendum will be held you forgot an `` if '' then . 
  everything from now on is pure speculation .
