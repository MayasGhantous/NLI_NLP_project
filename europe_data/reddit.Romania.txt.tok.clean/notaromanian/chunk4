  huge party with a lot of people singing and marching around the whole country . 
  ( beer 's on me ), 
  you do n't get it , do you ? 
  what i mean is that there is nobody even talking about impeaching the president , and you 're stating that a referendum will be held . 
  ** no it wo n't because no one is even suggesting it yet ** i never said that 's not how it works . 
  yes , in the case that the parliament votes to impeach the president , there will be a referendum . 
   a referendum will be held no , it wo n't be held ( not yet at least ) . 
  you 're fake news, 
  there is n't any report about any kind of referendum yet . 
  that 's pure speculation and it 's pointless to even consider it now . 
  yeah it can happen , but that does n't mean it will . 
  mad because our shittiest party is destroying itself ? 
  i 'm so mad !!, 
  * checks flair * yeah ... tell me more, 
  i am aware of that , but the parties still suggest the pm to the president and only after that he nominates him/her . 
  i 'm sure no one will bat an eye . . 
  the referendum will most definitely not pass, 
  yet he would lose a lot more if he impeaches the president . 
  dragnea knows that if he impeaches the president he 's dead . 
  he lost support even from his own party during this crysis , and from his voters . 
  he lost power edit : spelling, 
  and now klaus iohannis ( the president ) can deny any pm suggestion and trigger new elections . 
  the plot thickens . 
  ** what a shit show **, 
  * it speaks emoji !, 
  yeah no ... you voted leave , you leave . 
  you end almost every country name with szag ( land ) yet you call our country rom\u00e1nia . 
  i wonder why haha, 
  if the c is followed by either e or i it makes the che/chi sound as in chess , if followed by any other letter it makes the hard k sound . 
  pity votes, 
  you 're missing the point . 
  it was n't 1 jury , most of them voted politcally . 
  what i 'm saying is that the jury should n't be the one voting for neighbours and all that stuff , but the public . 
  if you do n't understand what i 'm saying please avoid commenting . 
  what a condescending dude ... 
  agreed, 
  wow . 
  we 're at war now ukraine . 
  switzerland 0 points for our yodel . 
  disappointed . 
  we failed . 
  almost no points from spain or italy for romania . 
  hmmmmm, 
  biased, 
  you 're not alone ... my prediction was true . 
  it 's time to cross the danube, 
  thanks bros !, 
  lol , it seems even more biased !, 
  thank you !, 
  that sucks ... 
  borat , is that you ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  jury vote now , and the popular vote just adds up ? 
  why do they only say the 12 points ? 
  ughh i was expecting that portugal . 
  thank you very much !, 
  2 run ups of all the singers but just the order number , no phone numbers or anything in the space where they should be displayed . 
  ok why did spanish tve not show the voting numbers on screen ? 
  the voting had n't stopped when i checked . 
  everyone on / r/europe do n't forget a vote for yodel is a vote for a strong europe !, 
  this is actually nice, 
  belarus , azerbaijan , moldova , hungary , italy , romania and belgium are my favs . 
  yodel it !, 
   well , salvador has a health condition ( reported to be a heart condition but this has not been confirmed ) that meant he could n't leave portugal in time for initial rehearsals . 
  his sister , luisa , stood in for him during technical rehearsals , while salvador arrived in time for the first semi-final . 
  i like the song , but it 's not the winning song . 
  welp there we go lads . 
  portugal will win . 
  not to be rude or anything ( and anyone can disagree if they feel to ) and i really liked portugal 's song but having something really different about you ( that has nothing to do with music ) that gets you votes is an unfair advantage . 
  i 'm sorry but it 's true and it happened before . 
  portugal 's win will not be totally deserved . 
  i do wish him best health and success in future . 
  for a moment i thought the background was a tardis in space . 
  she just wants to go home ... 
  they did n't let them fire confetti out of them in the semi-final so i 'd be surprised if they fire . 
  oh god , we 're sorry . 
  true . 
  it 's just an eurovision circlejerk . 
  do n't mind us . 
  `` human '' vibe at the start . 
  celebrating ... diversity ? 
  i expect a rick roll . 
  if there is none i will be disappointed . 
  the future of the world !, 
  spain , 2 of your guys are trying to mate in the background . 
  living in spain i see those traits in a lot of mediterranean girls ( spain , italy , greece ) and i 'm used to it . 
  i find nordic girls absurdly beautiful because i see them as sort of exotic and exotic appeals . 
  `` the empire on which the sun never sets '', 
  shame !, 
  the song is very nice but i crave for australia to send a really whacky and weird song next time in the true spirit of eurovision, 
  barbie ? 
  my bet is still between moldova and italy, 
  i like how she lost the tone when she started typing . 
  weird song and weird scenario , but i quite like it . 
  only the western part of armenia was .
