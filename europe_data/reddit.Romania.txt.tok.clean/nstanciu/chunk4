  walking through budapest , you see tons of cars with `` greater hungary '' stickers . 
  do n't tell me it 's not a revisionist statement cause i ai n't buying it . 
  well , we call it what caesar himself called it . 
  maybe the gypsies should rename themselves , 
  yeah , just read any hungarian comments after something about trianon has been posted . 
  you 'll never get over it , so we have to be careful as to not let you destabilize ardeal , like when orban comes here every summer and says shit and gets away with it because `` muh european cooperation '' . 
  hint : it 's bullshit . 
  that being said , i frankly do n't give a shit about szekely autonomy . 
  contrary to popular belief , we know szekelis exist , we just do n't like to recognize they have a `` szekely land '' , for purely political reasons . 
  we 've always called ourselves `` rumani '' ; as a 17th century moldavian author wrote , `` noi de la rim ( roma ) ne tragem '' , roughly `` our origins are in rome '' . 
  we 've never called ourselves vlachs . 
  we did use regional identifiers to distinguish among ourselves , but we 've always been `` moldovan romanian '' , which is why the so-called `` moldovans '' nowadays are made fun of in romania . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum ) . 
  this is just the beginning and i 'm always happy to help those of us who have n't had ... the best of historical educations . 
  read about the diet and its conflict with maria theresa regarding the romanian peasants , if you 're interested , as well . 
  transylvanian romanians tend to remember this stuff . 
  i 'm a southerner , i was n't affected , but you might have an explanation why we 're so reticent to give the hungarian minority any concessions , 
  thanks for the support . 
  one positive thing about hungary i can say off the top of my head is that you have the first and so far only admiral without a sea : horthy . 
  thanks for agreeing with me . 
  yes , like , actual hungary plus a few other neighboring territories inhabited by completely different ethnic groups . 
  you know they still have a navy , right ? 
  i do n't think the phrase `` getting over something '' exists in hungarian . 
  `` historical hungary '' ? 
  you mean the one with , like , 40 % hungarians ? 
  yeah , really threatening dude . 
  kinda hard to recover `` your '' lost territories when you ca n't resort to declaring the majority population second-grade citizens . 
  so i 've been told , but hey , we should put our differences aside and be friendly ... look , a nice [ picture ] ( https://thumb9.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/4198777/521444032/stock-photo-the-statue-of-avram-iancu-surrounded-by-romanian-flags-and-orthodox-cathedral-of-cluj-napoca-521444032.jpg ) of a notable cluj landmark a few days ago, 
  it 's already here , mate . 
  such is life in this region . 
  you do n't get it , we 're reconquering it with middle-aged tourists . 
  `` de la nistru pan ' la tisa , de la dunare si mare , pan ' la ceremus '', 
  i would say `` fite me irl '' , but last time you did that , we took [ pictures ] ( http://only-romania.com/wp-content/uploads/et_temp/regiment-rom%c3%a2n-de-v%c3%a2n%c4%83tori-la-coloana-mileniului-din-budapesta-137204_573x187.jpg ), 
  exactly . 
  this is the one area in which you 're better than us by far . 
  ( i 'm romanian myself ), 
  poles do crimes in we , lithuanians do crimes in we ... they 're not as universally disliked as we are . 
  you know why everybody seems to think romania 's shit ? 
  cause they see our gypsies in front of supermarkets , in subway stations , begging on the street , offering to wash up windshields ... they get their phones stolen by gypsies on the bus in their previously extremely safe capitals ... that 's why we 're more disliked than the rest . 
  because we have more gypsies and , as such , confirmation bias kicks in and every gypsy they see is a `` romanian '' ... * because their media thinks exactly like you and acts accordingly , making absolutely no distinction between ethnic romanians and gypsies * . 
  romania is a nation-state , it says so in the constitution . 
  so we should sacrifice our international reputation ( it 's too late for that ) just to please a minority that does not want to integrate ? 
  he 's a commie himself , that 's why he subtly tries to paint them as tolerant , 
   discrimination against the roma oh , ffs , stop calling them `` roma '' . 
  it 's because of bleeding heart twats like you that i 'm ashamed to tell people i 'm romanian when i go abroad . 
  `` you 're romanian ? 
  how come you 're not black haired ? '' . 
  seriously , we should know better than to call them that ourselves . 
  we 're an interesting people ; most of our `` convictions '' are , in fact , something we 've assimilated by default , something that simply * is * ... this absolutely applies to christianity . 
  romanians are christians because of inertia . 
  very few people actually attend church or read from the bible , but everybody and their cousin is a `` christian '' . 
  i think this extends to stuff like disliking gays ... romanians dislike gays because it 's `` how it 's done '' . 
  we 're not malicious in our homophobia like , say , the russians or the serbs . 
  we 're simply homophobic because of inertia . 
  interesting phenomenon in terms of sociology . 
  and here i am , an atheist in romania . 
  ~ ~ send help ~ ~, 
  hey , mate , like it or not , but a high level of religiosity in a society showcases the fact that said society is still behind the most advanced ones in many areas . 
  in our case , that 's obvious . 
  now , i 'm an atheist , i was born and raised in bucharest , i have a pretty liberal circle of friends etc. . . i might be biased . 
  but i truly believe the power `` bor '' has over our society and even our politics , whether you like to admit it or not , is extremely embarrassing . 
  when it comes to this stuff , we 're closer to iran than we are to hungary or bulgaria . 
  holy * shit * , that was ... a speech . 
  poland , you 're making our priests look enlightened . 
  proud of my country . 
  proud of us for not getting complacent . 
  we 've managed to stop the decree from getting adopted , but we should n't stop until we 've managed to get this government to resign . 
  of course we seem `` distant '' from your perspective , since only one of our two ethnicities migrated from the steppes on horseback , 
  we 're richer , but apart from that , quite similar . 
  we do n't have a russian minority , but russia can always find another pretext . 
  it 's probably because they 're a proto-fascist regime that 's showing clear signs of schizophrenia in terms of external policy . 
  they 're not even fucking consistent . 
  we 're conquering them with middle-aged people with small kids and they 're not even aware of it . 
  it 's glorious covert warfare . 
  i knew that sri money was put to good use . 
   be friendly . 
  ukraine tried to do that . 
  it did n't exactly work , did it . 
  diversity , full on uncontrolled immigration , `` we should n't hate gypsies cause they 're the same as us , and it 's not their fault they steal shit in the west and then the blame is placed on us '' , those who feel the slightest bit of disgust when they see two men kissing on the street are bigoted , etc. 
  it 's prevalent in the west and it 's starting to spread among young people here , too . 
  well , some of you do , perhaps the majority , but you have more old people who like russia . 
  over here , old people hate russia even more than young people . 
  gib back southern dobrogea , you pickle eating knob !, 
  dude , i know 3 out gay people and a couple of out bi people . 
  they 're all in their 20s , since , you know , those are the people i hang out with . 
  i 'm fully aware my `` evidence '' is anecdotal , but are n't all opinions inherently formed based on anecdotal criteria ? 
  well , i mean , russia has fucked things up for us ( and the region ) many , many times in the past . 
  some people point out that our war of independence was fought alongside the russians , but that was merely a matter of context , the russians did n't give two shits about us and would 've have preferred it if we were annexed entirely . 
  they 've stolen one of our most important historical regions away from us , filled it with `` aliens '' who hate us and indoctrinated the ethnically romanian population to such an extent that they now believe they 're another ethnicity . 
  also , they brought us 50 years of brutal totalitarianism `` by tank '' , suppressing pro-democracy demonstrations in the 40s by using live bullets , killing students , taking civilians hostage , then imposing a reign of terror . 
  and now , this . 
  you 'll have real difficulties finding a nation that hates russia more than us . 
  maybe poland and the baltics . 
  as long as russia is something , we 'll strive to be the complete opposite . 
  iliescu 's oldschool , he does n't swear allegiance to putin , only to gorbachov and `` marele urss '' . 
  so funny joak , learned that on cs go ? 
  i 'm not dismissing single parents , i 'm just saying , the best way to grow up is in a two parent household , in which the parents are of the opposite gender . 
  in general , i think people raised by two gay parents , be them male or female , will have trouble fitting in and will be bullied regardless of the general attitude towards gay people in their respective societies , solely because kids bully other kids who stand out , in one way or another . 
  i 'm an atheist living in bucharest and a student and i still do n't share the neo-liberal `` rainbow '' mindset in its entirety . 
  i despise atheists who claim religion is something that needs to be eradicated .
