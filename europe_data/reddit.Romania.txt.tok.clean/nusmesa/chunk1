'' the soft underbelly of europe '' churchill was right ... 
  ** military ** acording to [ this  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel ) romania has 73,900 active military ; 45.000 in reserve . 
  poland has 120,000 active military ; 515,000 in reserve . 
  there is a different number stated [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_land_forces ) but i 'll keep the bigger one . 
  in ** tanks ** : romania has [ ~ 1000 tanks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_land_forces#equipment ) aparently ... 
  it 's mbt is [ tr-85 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tr-85 ) based on the soviet t-55 . 
  poland has [ 900 tanks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_land_forces#equipment ) and it 's mbt is the [ pt-91 twardy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pt-91_twardy ) based on the soviet [ t-72 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-72 ) ... 
  the big difference is in ** aircraft ** . 
  [ poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_air_force#aircraft_inventory ) vs [ romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_air_force#aircraft_inventory ), 
  not really there were a lot of inventions that were initially meant to be military equipment that are used today in households all over the world . 
  neo-socialism think china, 
  from a dutch who came to romania he said it 's insanely populated compared . 
  because capitalism, 
  i consider it , because the ancestors of the modern-day italians are the romans ... 
  it 's not like the romans all died and italians came from another place . 
  rome is still the capital . 
  war in europe was won/lost in stalingrad . 
  so in europe the russians did most of the job . 
  in the pacific theater the us won it . 
  yes , most people forget about mussolini . 
  but it 's true that italy was kinda weak throughout the war . 
  how is this different then how americans tend to liberate some middle eastern countries today ? 
  fuck the left , fuck the right . 
  they are all thieves . 
  voted for a independent ex-gymnast . 
  http://corinaungureanu.ro/foto/ but i 'm hearing that the old ~ ~ commies ~ ~ `` social-democrats '' get the most votes again . 
  the paint is strong in that one  nice one though, 
  also churches suddenly appear in every single park , and their bells rock the sunday morning calm . 
   this week marked the 150th anniversary of our loss against prussia in the schleswig war . 
  :d remember defeats !, 
  i like you danish !, 
  well then enjoy the gypsies in all of your town centers ... 
  the other way around : most of the poor people who leave romania come from the eastern part of romania , mostly romanian moldova , because it 's the most undeveloped part of romania , and they have no other prospects . 
  gypsies are gypsies , they will always try to get a easy living . 
  yes they are more in romania then any other country . 
  recently i returned from munchen , germany , and there were tons of gypsies coming from romania . 
  they come because germans are not used to them , and give them money , they usually sell newspapers or just beg . 
  and if germany does n't do anything about it they will be more . 
  just do some tv spots and tell germans not to give them money , and they will leave . 
   sucks that we got that rep. 
  but romania does have the biggest population of gypsies and we did have gypsies as slaves during the boyar period , so i understand . 
  hah , there are a lot of romanians who prefer the bulgarian black sea to the romanian black sea resorts , because of quality per $, 
  like they can do anything ... they can not do anything about this in the us , how can a common russian do more ? 
  ... antena 3 is shit tv alot more shit then regular tv, 
   well , no , i do n't think he should be the next president just because he 's a good speaker ... yet most presidents get there just because they are good speakers . 
  at least in eastern europe, 
  holy shit , eu has [ olaf ] ( http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/sq9dqrqewly/maxresdefault.jpg ) as a anti-fraud agency . 
  http://www.opiniatimisoarei.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/drum-judetean-hunedoara-caras.jpg  still not as big difference as 2 counties in romania . 
  hunedoara county finished the road , caras-severin did n't even start it out of funds . 
  holy fuck bulgaria has only 7.3 million people ... romania has 20.1 million ... 
  source ? 
  `` love building was very well received in romania by the audience . '', 
  i 've never heard of it ... but i did n't open my tv in 3 years so ... 
  and the pegas bikes http://tinylink.net/75783, 
  was in romania also ... rubbed it on chest to make nose free when you had a cold ... 
   i 'm going to vote for the ( `` anti-euro party '' )  i 'm pro immigration  i want a strong eu  a strong euro wat, 
  i like this one . 
  people forget how eastern the eastern border of europe as a continent is ... http://i.imgur.com/wtwv5ty.png, 
  because the eu is not the us . 
  i would love for some half-decent western politicians to come and cleanse our parliament for a few years . 
  but eh ... 
  haha http://i.imgur.com/82jrbsk.jpg what can i get for 12 ? 
  the problem in eastern europe is still corruption . 
  politicians are living the easy life . 
  taking uneducated decisions and getting paid . 
  so i do n't know . 
  i really hope the eu is not going to fail because of the recent recession or because of the too rapid expansion . 
  well off the top of my head : - `` job '' instead of the romanian `` loc de munca '' ( translated workplace ) , mainly because it 's shorter and easier to say i think . 
  1 syllable instead of 4 . 
  ... i do n't remember any other to be honest ... 
  meh corruption and greed are the real problem . 
  which have no easy solution . 
  i remember from history class back in 6-7th grade that there were a number of meetings after '45 to talk about germany 's reparation costs . 
  at each of those meetings the amount that needed to be paid by germany as reparation costs was reduced , mainly because of the poor state of the german economy after ' 45 . 
  at the last meeting of that kind it was decided that germany was going to pay the reparations costs when its economy will allow it . 
  which meant virtually never . 
  and that was that . 
  not sure how true the whole thing is though . 
  either way the amount of patents , copyrights and scientists that the allies ( mainly us ) took from germany right after ww2 are worth much more then any repair costs . 
  they pushed the us from a relatively weak economy and cultural significance to a super power that it is today . 
  a favorite example of mine is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wernher_von_braun who basically won the space race for the us . 
  another example is the flying wing design http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_wing that was perfected by junkers . 
  was taken by the us and they ended making the famous http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_b-2_spirit . 
  so yea . 
  oh yea i forgot . 
  the us also took all of germanys gold after '45 for safe keeping . 
  it was never returned . 
  when the roman empire split the eastern part became orthodox and the western part became catholic . 
  so most eastern european countries are orthodox and western are catholic . 
  ... ... . . gustibus = gust = taste coloribusque = color no est = not is disputandum = disputable - taste in color is not discutable ... or something similar ... 
  source : romanian is the closest language to old latin there exists today . 
  apparently . 
  meh a lot of countries today are weak culturally and identity-wise from what they once were . 
  just be happy you live in the country that at some point ruled over most of the known world . 
  it 's the first true modern civilization ( arguably ) . 
  too much nationalism leads to extremists . 
  too little leads to loosing your culture . 
  za frenchie owned you . 
  you must like this map then http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_curtain well the west eu are trying to fix the fact that they left eastern europe to stalin , by throwing money at east eu . 
  but the corruption is too big in east eu for money to fix the problem .
