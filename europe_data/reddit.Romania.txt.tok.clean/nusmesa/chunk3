  you clearly do n't understand them . 
  or never met any ... 
  http://imgur.com/a/gcshu edit : http://tinylink.net/66254 this house was made as a copy after the courthouse in caracal . 
  he made it like that because he was finally being prosecuted for his illegal business and he wanted to live in the building that put him behind bars . 
  http://www.evz.ro/uploads/tx_images/03_caracal-judecatoria_01.png except that it had the owners name written on it . 
  edit2 : by comparison romanian peasents from moldova ( poorest part of romania ) that are working abroad . 
  and their homes . 
  hungary is at it again ... http://i.imgur.com/fdv3c9s.jpg, 
   edit : btw refugee camps in turkey are one of the best , the effort and the high standards were recognised multiple times however living for years in a camp would be exhausting no matter how well the services are . 
  you ca n't expect people to spent their lives there . 
  nice try erdogan, 
  please post a picture of these `` romanians '' , and i 'll show you the difference ... 
  yep ... if they take 50.000 this year ... the number will keep on growing until you have a problem ... 
  these refugies probably do n't know any countries in europe besides germany ... austria ? 
  wtf is that i do n't wan na go there ... hungary ? 
  wtf are they all hungry there ? 
  never heard of it ... sweden ? 
  norway ? 
  finland ? 
  wat ... it will be interesting when some of them see snow ... 
  zerg rush, 
  is there a difference of view in germany between eu immigrants and african immigrants ? 
  turn them into zombies and use those brains you have to feed them . 
  i prefer to think of the dude as a romanian larry page / sergey brin . 
  doing it right because that 's how it should be done . 
  edit : rds just announced free 4g internet for all digi.mobil clients . 
  \u00cen rom\u00e2nia the company that gave us that great internet and mobile phone plans has a tv station ( digi24 ) that is really unbiased . 
  the rest of the channels are someway biased . 
  the national tv post is mostly biased for the party in power , and that is a problem because that channel can be seen even in the most remote village . 
  which will not happen, 
  romania : also [ '89 revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_revolution ) was n't a real revolution but a coup d'etat to remove ceausescu by [ a guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu ) who was basically his right hand and was president for 10 years after ' 89 . 
  in spain they close the center of towns and have a [ market ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-rgctiudfyi/maxresdefault.jpg ) during the day where people come with trucks and set up shops . 
  they sell all kinds of stuff from pets to pans , from t-shirts to fruits . 
  also they have these `` festes '' set in a day of the week where they gather to a place and drink and eat [ paella ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paella ) ... 
  it 's nice . 
  red , yellow and blue were found on late 16th century royal grants of michael the brave , as well as shields and banners . 
  during the wallachian uprising of 1821 , they were present on the canvas of the revolutionaries ' flag and its fringes ; for the first time a meaning was attributed to them : `` liberty ( sky-blue ) , justice ( field yellow ) , fraternity ( blood red ) '' . 
  it 's ok , most of us do n't know the difference ... 
  yep ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casa_presei_libere https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament, 
  at least budapest was rebuilt , but bucharest lost most of it 's old buildings and they were never rebuilt . 
  ruskies did won ww2 by zerging the germans . 
  as for romania , we were between great powers once again , and survived . 
  that 's about it . 
  lost a lot of ground in the forms of [ bassarabia and bukovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) and moldova was separated between romanian moldova and the republic of moldova . 
  the most disturbing part about this were the massacres and deportations to syberia of romanian peasants from these territories so they will have ukrainian majority . 
  [ about 250k in the first month . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bukovina#second_world_war ) i do n't mind the 2 counties we [ ceded ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/greater_romania.svg/1280px-greater_romania.svg.png ) to bulgaria after ww2 , but i do mind the teritories we ceded to ukraine ( do n't get me wrong , i 'm not going to putin them but still ... mila kunis could have been romanian . ), 
  i think / u/jondevries is just a random troll , reading few of his previous comments he seems like a romanian-born hungarian nationalist trolling every topic surrounding eastern europe . 
  was tap ... 
  just had my first one this weekend ... i was not impressed ... it tasted really watered down ... and not any better then any local black beer ... 
  well on one hand there was a [ de-stalinization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-stalinization ) of the soviet union after stalin . 
  but he did kill more people then hitler did . 
  but the `` last solution '' and the fact that stalin won the war changed how history views ww2 . 
  i personally like the way nazi germany enabled scientists to do all those stuff . 
  and german engineers always made things the right way . 
  they have the reputation to not cut corners . 
  and it showed . 
  all those stuff i listed was a result of these engineers . 
  yes some argue that by the end of ww2 the king tiger , or the elephant td was too complex for it 's purpose . 
  maybe this is the reason the us spies so heavily on germany today . 
  `` krupp steel porche engines ... who can defeat us ? '', 
  nazis may have had a bad ideology , but you have to give them credit for technological advancements at the time . 
  they were years ahead of everyone . 
  most of the us technology in the 50 after the war was [ taken from germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_paperclip ) . 
  us won the space race because of the [ german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wernher_von_braun ) s who made the v1 and v2 rockets . 
  only reason they lost the war was the [ cockyness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stalingrad ) of hitler , and the numbers of soviets . 
  and to be honest i 'd prefer it , from a technological , administrative , economical sense that germany won ww2 . 
  i know it 's not a popular opinion in the west but stalinism was worse . 
  [ germans in romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons ) always had a good reputation . 
  hell we elected a ethnic german president . 
  panzers and luftwaffe are used because they are like a brand along with the german wehrmacht . 
  they were the best the world had seen at the time . 
  nothing came near to it . 
  stug iii , hetzer , panzer ii , panzer iii , panzer iv , panther , tiger , king tiger focke-wulf fw 190 , messerschmitt bf 109 , junkers ju 87 , messerschmitt me 262 u-boat , [ bismarck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_battleship_bismarck ) . 
  v1 , v2 rockets . 
  legendary stuff back then . 
  are n't all generations present the result of earlier generations decisions ? 
  good or bad it 's always been this way . 
  you ca n't do nothing . 
  previous governments managed greece badly and this is the result . 
  make sure you do the right decisions and make a better future for your kids . 
   romania post-communism was practically a failed state for many years due to the aforementioned dictators policies as well . 
  show me one former soviet country that did extremely well after ' 89 . 
  the problem was n't the previous dictators policies ; it was the governments after '89 ... especially [ iliescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu ) , who some say was the next general secretary in line anyway . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/39q9rzo.jpg ) ... [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4hcfcdl.jpg ) ... [ 3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bah3hl1.jpg ) i 'd put it on the sale of romanias industry after '89 to follow the western privatisation example . 
  but 99 % of the sales were made at 5-10 % of the value ; and the buyers just shut down everything , sold it to scrap metal and moved on . 
  kmon dude ... nobody who is working is starving in romania . 
  yea we 're not the richest of countries , but i do n't know a single family who is working and it 's starving ; or had their savings blocked ... 
  yes we have older people with smaller pensions then what some europeans make in a day ... 
  ... well this is interesting, 
  only in certain parts of romania . 
  in transylvania we usually give a offering to our vampire ancestors and we are fine . 
  we also keep blood bats as pets . 
  yea but this sounds bad-ass, 
  yea but without the n it sounds like a pirate sais yes ... aye !, 
  the n is silent, 
  why are there so many churches ... 
  :d imf tells tsipras to stop gambling bwahahahhahahahaha the irony, 
  pretty much ... it 's smaller ... but most of all there is a military song about fighting for transilvania that is probably the most known military song in romania ... so if the hungarians go for it  music will set us freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  not fear , just spite i think,
