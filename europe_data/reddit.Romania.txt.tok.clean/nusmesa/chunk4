  idk i 've been looking in and there are only a few times those countries had faster internet ... considering romania is 3.7 times bigger then lithuania http://i.imgur.com/okw85zj.png http://explorer.netindex.com/maps, 
  that would be if hungarians were attacking ... 
  in the recent history , < 150 years , i 'd say the [ romanian hungarian war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian%e2%80%93romanian_war ) . 
  romania won , reunited transylvania with rest of romania , removed the [ communists from hungary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_soviet_republic ) . 
  but romania did this without aproval from the former ww1 allies ( entente ) and was removed from recieving ww1 reparations from germany / turkey . 
  or uk starting to get orders from her colonies ... 
   then you have people who simply believe in small government and obviously see a large political structure such as the eu as completely oppossed to their world view . 
  uk was the biggest fucking empire the world has ever seen ... what the actual fuck ... 
  2 weeks is 14 days ... i 'd say 14 days in a single place can be boring if you 're only visiting ... even 7 ... so maybe 4 days in a place with 2 days remaining for travelling between is better ... 3 spots ... 4 days each ... 2 days remaining for travelling between ... if you are visiting tourist spots in a city 4 days is enough ... if you plan to party , go clubbing and etc. 
  maybe take the 7 days 2 spot alternative ... you can take 3 of any big capital cities in europe and stay 4 days in each and have fun ... europe is not as big distance wise between cities as the us . 
  paris-london by train only takes 2.5 hours . 
  paris-barcelona 15 hours . 
  paris-rome 20 hours . 
  you can take a night train with beds so you sleep while traveling . 
  paris-berlin 8 hours . 
  or you can go paris-rome-athens ... or any combination really ... 
  why would gays & gypsies pick the soviets ? 
  stalin sent milions to siberia ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union, 
  i doubt anyone from the former iron curtain would pick the ruskies at that time ... maybe ukraine and bielorusia , but those are special cases ... 
  hurr durr ruskies , because hitler lost the war , eastern europe was fucked for the next 40 years or so ... 
  choosing between germans and ruskies is a easy choice to make any day ... 
  same thing in romania , ruskies pillaged and raped everywhere they went ... my gf 's 95 yr old aunt told me stories . 
  her grandfather for example was in the field when ruskies went by and a soldier just asked for his watch ... he could n't say no ... girls were hiding eveywhere ... 
  why do we want a trade agreement with the us ? 
  http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/74631195001  could n't find the part on youtube ... and about tesla ... i actually saw 2 tesla model s 's in cluj-napoca last month ... 
  itt : romanians and their second world problems ... 
  / r/vilefrog looks like a agitator ; he only posted in / r/europe mainly since he created the account 1 year ago and mostly negative and stirring posts . 
  proud : - long history of a people stuck between great empires that managed to survive . 
  - internet :p ashamed : - poorer uneducated romanians are moving abroad to earn a bigger paycheck and do stupid shit , making a bad name for all of us - gypsies or `` roma '' getting confused with actual romanians, 
  well depends on your version of expensive ... 
  in romania , moldavian wines are usually 10 times the price of the romanian mid-tier wines ... 
  most of the moldavian wines are usually around 40-50 euros a bottle . 
  considering the minimum wage is still around 220 euros ... that 's expensive . 
  while a good romanian wine is usually around 4-5 euros . 
  [ beciul domnesc ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e84xnk6.jpg ) , [ zestrea de murfatlar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/on6ueq1.jpg ) and [ grasa de cotnari ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bavpssh.jpg ) ( i 'm told it 's good , but i do n't like white wine ... ), 
  it 's not cheap wine ... they actually keep in stored in barrels for a number of years before selling it . 
  lol norway ... looks like russia tbh ... romania exports cruise ships , and warships ? 
  wtf, 
  idk i live in cluj and it 's dusty as hell in this city ... maybe it 's because they just started repairing most of the inner city roads ... and the city looks like a construction site ... 
  ping 2 ms. . . you downloaded from the other room ? 
  nah it wont http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_relationship, 
  you need a idea and then you need to work for it . 
  with nay-sayers like you there would be nothing done ... ever ... 
  fact is europe is the old continent . 
  modern civilization started here . 
  our grand-grandfathers fought for and made this continent what it is today . 
  but on a global scale we are the smallest continent ( except australia , which is more of a country/continent ) . 
  we need the eu to be competitive in the future . 
  the african countries and making their own union , south america too . 
  the eu with it 's history has more claim to a union then any of those other continents . 
  my countries king is a cousin of your countries queen . 
  we fought against germany together . 
  twice . 
  we fought against eachother once . 
  your prince likes to travel to my country a lot . 
  you speak a germanic language . 
  i speak a latin language . 
  romans counquered your country as they did mine . 
  and left their mark . 
  just imagine a far future where space exploration is in order . 
  do you think uk alone , or poland , or germany can compete with huge asian or african unions ? 
  eu is a vision of something bigger . 
  more important then any of us . 
  it 's the future vision of the civilization that started on this continent a few thousand years ago . 
  yes there are a lot of conservatives , hell there are still people who want transylvania and a couple of other territories to go back into greater hungary ... but with people like these who are always looking at the past we have no future . 
  this is the vision . 
  now how do we make it work ? 
  idk i do n't see anything about it in the sub rules, 
  why ? ... 
  if you like rum ... then we got something for you ... [ this ] ( http://www.romautentic.ro/produse/ ) , and it 's full sized version , [ this ] ( http://www.romautentic.ro/wp-content/uploads/banner3_romtablete.png ) , or oreo [ version ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrobygja1mu/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  rom is the very short name for the country , thus the flag on the chocolate , also it 's the same word for rum , thus the flavor . 
  another thing is that the ads for the chocolate always make fun of country related stuff ... similar to / r/polandball [ example 1 ] ( http://www.forbes.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/rom-bucharest-not-budapest.png ) ... [ example 2 ] ( http://www.iaa.ro/images/upload/1897.jpg ) and [ example 3 ] ( http://www.mccann.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rom-american.jpg ) the budapest / bucharest confusion happened few years back when some dudes bought plain tickets to the wrong city . 
  and since rom always had bucuresti ( bucharest ) written on the chocolate bar , they made the ads ... 
  probably election year is coming, 
  yea , fuck you hungary hahahaha, 
  idk about that . 
  it 's odd . 
  now i see a few days with temps at -20 and then weeks of above 0 . 
  still no winters full of snow like i remember from 15 years ago ... holy fuck 15 years ago i was 11 and playing in the snow ... 
  damn time passes, 
  when i read this i thought that part of the blame for the graverobbing was the author of the article ... 
  he pointed the grave and only after it was robbed . 
  i did n't know this was a trend . 
  but he should have been more careful to who he showed the grave . 
  dat language though ... 
  she 's kinda right  ... too bad most romanian universities , except a few , have little to no reputation . 
  should probably do the outsides of the buildings too . 
  romania also has plastic banknotes ... 
  he went to the street and turned around and started to yell at the parliament, 
  we ve got our very own eminem ... mihai eminescu ... close enough ... his most famous poem is called `` eveningstar '' . 
  aparently it 's the longest love poem ever made . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luceaf\u0103rul_ ( poem ) it 's really long ... http://www.gabrielditu.com/eminescu/lucifer.asp, 
  menu of the day at most restaurants , for example beef soup , grilled pork with mashed potatoes with pickels , and a small piece of dessert is around 4,5 euros . 
  yep . 
  also the carpathians inspired the mountains surrounding mordor . 
  fuck corporate america, 
  healthcare retirement predatory practices wealth gap people being treated like tradeable usable stuff ... 
  that 's kinda gay dude ... 
  damn ... 
  but true,
