  ofc you 're mad about that it 's not like you are getting any action anyways ... 
  so people will chain crash on them ? 
  that and the fact that the languages are very similar . 
  i speak romanian and english very good . 
  i 've learned german in highschool , but did n't really pay attention ( damn highschool decisions ) but can talk a little bit / understand . 
  so on that level i 'm also with spanish ( very easy for romanians ) and french . 
  i 'm trying to study french now ... but this language is ... omg ... you write a lot of stuff you do n't read . 
  and if we are here already ... i 'm going to rant about all the french and german dudes who say they do n't need to learn another language , let other people learn theirs . 
  pretty nice  ... will visit in the future !, 
  while i 'm in favor i would only agree in the case of federalization of romania . 
  transylvania with 3-5 big counties . 
  romanian moldova united with moldavian moldova in 2-4-6 big counties . 
  lower romania ( valahia ) with dobrogea in 4-6 big counties . 
  there were n't really 20 you can choose from ... 2-3 per neighborhood, 
  [ serious short answer ? 
  piracy . 
  this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ct58s/average_internet_speed_in_eu_by_country/cjiyt5n ) is a much better explanation . 
  much closer to the truth . 
  somebody make a / r/polandball of this thread !, 
  the ammount of roma confused with romanians is so big i 've stopped trying . 
  i have friends who tell people they are from transylvania instead ... it gets a more positive response . 
  a friends french husband thought all romania is populated by gypsies . 
  like really . 
  the friend is from morocco and studied medicine in romania and is now in france . 
  ... that feeling when your isp brings you more speed then the average user can handle ... 
  yea , my bad :d, 
  yea ... especially since the biggest slice of the pie comes from spanish central government . 
  oh look , it 's almost 1 ~ ~ trillion ~ ~ bilion euros . 
  nah i do n't think we are remembered for the bad places ... just because most of the people who left romania after the borders opened are uneducated low income poor people who did a lot of bad stuff , and they got in the news . 
  so yea ... 
  there is plenty of that ... but not only that ... now that we are on this subject ... i fucking hate it on how people from bucharest talk about the rest of romania as people from the province ... i hate that word ... from their view there is bucharest and the rest of the plebs from the province ... look at this bullshit : http://imgur.com/lsbag1k https://www.urgentcargus.ro/contact/, 
  you should try the mcv ... really well made cars, 
  someone do n't tell them there are a lot of hungarians coming to work in oradea .

  shut your foul mouth ... this is the best government romania had since '89, 
  it will be over soon ... the current government do n't wan na play anymore , they quit :(, 
  how is that a illegal version of uber ? 
  a lot of romanian cars , especially from the south romania , will register their foreign bought cars in bulgaria to dodge pollution taxes placed by the government . 
  the bulgarian loop-hole . 
  now with tanks ! \u2122, 
  yea, 
  so they actually did it, 
  well anglo-saxons left the union ... maybe that 's why they 're over thinking everything, 
  good thing there are no japanese around here ... they will bash you for bashing their minimalist life style, 
  yea but you ca n't get karma for that !, 
  i love how it goes swimming between tatvan and van, 
  ancient aliens obviously, 
  how do you pay for anything if you do n't tax . 
  how 's healthcare and transport infrastructure in bulgaria ? 
  or city maintenance, 
  and religion , islam and eastern orthodoxy do n't mix ... and ruskies are the most orthodox people there are ... 
   we 're shit countries separately imho . 
  ahhhh there it is, 
   just something that made me laugh . 
  i have no further opinion . 
  damage control right there , 
  nk invests in eastern poland !, 
  the colonies are quite rowdy tonight ... 
  we 're all friends on this rock in space ... except hungarians ... fuck those guys ... 
  maybe because of the distance, 
  here is a `` why romania '' from a similar thread : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ct58s/average_internet_speed_in_eu_by_country/cjiyt5n?context=3, 
  government did n't invest in our national infrastructure . 
  a company did . 
  why does it matter , it was a bus for the campaign he was leading ... with a thing he said ... nobody else said it ... he put that idea in the campaign and the campaign put it on the bus ... 
  i 've never said i ca n't accept that ... history is history ... now tell the same thing to the hungarians and their trianon, 
  what ... 
  anymore ... https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/bucov.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a2nt%c3%a2na_alb%c4%83_massacre, 
  no , i meant on the map, 
  and romania is on top of it ... 
  that 's not the same amount of money . 
  and if you 're talking about the healthcare taxes also , then that is a really bad idea . 
  how is the same amount of money in circulation ? 
  you would need to make companies pay in tax what you pay the population in basic income . 
  and if you do that then companies make no profit ... only way i see basic income to work is to tax the rich , and the big profit corporations , and give that money back to the population . 
  which in turn is a win-win since it will bring more people in the middle-class and more clients to the companies . 
  but good luck selling bigger taxes to the rich and the corporations . 
  ah i see ... i think instead of the basic income we should make a 4 day work week and 3 weekend . 
  same pay . 
  i do n't know about the future , robots taking jobs ... it will happen . 
  and you have a huge problem here . 
  if you give people basic income , then money will devalue , as there is a lot of it . 
  companies will get richer as there are more able consumers . 
  if you do n't give people jobs nor basic income , then companies have no clients and nobody to buy their stuff . 
  i do n't know what to say ... 
  i do n't know what those effects are ... but my question/problem with it is that it will make money less valuable , and companies richer . 
  yet still using one to justify the other, 
  there was a case of gypsies enslaving poor and mentaly ill people in romania last year . 
  [ english source ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/human-traffickers-kept-65-young-people-slave-like-caught-romania/ ) but this i think is just some poor romanian farmers from the east that went to italy to make some money . 
  unfortunately these kind of people get abused while the roma from romania do bad stuff and give all a bad reputation .

  yea , almost 100 years before ww2, 
  well i 'm not sure about how taxing is done in de , but if everyone is taxed on that % regardless of income , then it is crazy . 
  i did n't say democracy is good or bad . 
  all i said is that it 's slow . 
  slow to act , slow to reform , slow to do anything . 
  this power and opposition dance is only slowing things down . 
  the opposition nowadays only do that ... oppose .
