  what 's next ? 
  kindergarten bathrooms with 2-way mirrors for pedophiles to masturbate safely ? 
  i 've heard of `` nanny state '' but never of `` enabler state '' . 
  if they remove the risks and deterrents of drug abuse by legitimizing them with safety nets , what 's to discourage others from flirting with the idea ? 
  not only should they remove the comfort and enabling from the equation , they should covertly poison the drugs before they get on the streets , so as to ad instantaneous death as a deterrent to use , by turning every dose in to a russian roulette of `` shooting up '' . 
  it 's this kind of defeatist bullshit that allow for new generations of addicts to be formed with 100 year old substances . 
  the ons figures show the uk has about 500.000 deaths per year , the number of eu migrants in the uk is 3.200.000 the largest group of which is the 800.000 polish making up 40 % of the 2.000.000 that are * eastern * europeans . 
  so in 13 years since poland joined in 2004 6.5 million people died in uk and have been replaced by a `` swarm '' of 3.2 million . 
  let 's also keep in mind that there are about 2.000.000 brits living in the eu and another 2.500.000 living elsewhere on the globe , which makes the 4.500.000 emigrants + 6.500.000 deaths a 11.000.000 vacancy filled by a whopping 3.200.000 europeans . 
  if you want to pretend you have a immigration problem go sing this song on r/pakistan or r/india . 
  or you can just admit you got played like a bunch of brexit bitches ... 
  yes we 've had good teachers ... we 'll pull a moldova or even a transnistria on them and they wont know what to do with themselves . 
  the eu should issue a statement saying that all brits born in the past 42 years have a right to retain their eu citizenship and rights , as well as to extend that to their children . 
  all those who wish to abandon their eu citizenship should be able to do so by filing a formal request . 
  that would effectively leave a majority of uk citizens as a eu `` asset '' in the uk , as well as empowering the eu to intervene in uk affairs as representatives of eu citizens and their rights , as they are living in under a foreign regime . 
  i ca n't think of a better strategy to destabilize uk rule and ensure that even tho they keep the estate , they 'll never get the serfs needed to work it . 
  we 've almost doubled our gdp in 10 years , even with loosing 50 % of the work age adults to emigration , and with this year 's 3.9 % - 4.3 % growth we 're about to overtake sweden , and although sweden is a smaller country , it 's still something . 
  having left-wing print media is like preaching to the choir , right-wing idiots do n't read , so there is no balance to disturb anyway ... 
  who 'd 've taught legitimizing the grievances of undersexed ultra-nationalist morons , would backfire spectacularly , with them being spurned on to spew all that repressed anger and frustration at life , in to the unsuspecting and defenseless general public ... 
  literally no one could have seen this coming . 
  by the by , out of the hundreds of obscure flair flags this sub has , * none of them is the rainbow flag * . 
   started complaining about eating too many croissants it could have been worse , he could have said something about garlic . 
  i was thinking the same thing but never said it , 
  `` for the state should draw the sharp line of distinction between those who , as members of the nation , are the foundation and support of its existence and greatness , and those who are domiciled simply as earners of their livelihoods of there . '', 
  and if they cut cars they also have to cut gas heating , no ? 
  also nitrogen fertilizer uses a lot of gas in it 's production , without it agriculture production quantities per hectare fall by 50 + % . 
  that 'll cost each eu citizen # 33 or # 0.09 a day for a year  and if we wait until the pound collapses ... these euro will go that much further . 
  well put `` scottish liberation '' on kickstater if need be . 
  calm your tits ... there 's only about 182.000 romanians , and 60.000 are only there during fruit picking season . 
  your wet dreams of having that island become a comfort sanctuary for the unremarkable , is hilarious  standing around all frail and scared that a big strong immigrant who 's able to do a better , faster , cheaper job than you , might come in trough the wide open borders and make it difficult for you to extort a higher pay from some defenseless employer who has only your sub par but native ass , to do business with  that 's not how this works , that 's not how any of this works ... you ca n't hide from the world and be in business with the world . 
  [ yet australians are still not allowed to move to the uk ] ( http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/australiauk-bond-under-threat-from-britains-discriminatory-visa-and-migration-policies-dfat-report/news-story/d93f1ed2ca71ba961eb71c4bf5b2cf5c ) ps : it 's because they do n't want a `` white bleed '' to jeopardize english power models in the white commonwealth . 
  she has to make it look good for the queen , make her feel `` she 's getting her money 's worth '' . 
  there 's a shady austrian company here cutting down our forests and it 's owned by very cunty politico-aristocratic vienerschnitzels from high up in the government over there . 
  edit : it 's called [ holzindustrie schweighofer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holzindustrie_schweighofer ), 
  they use cbs to talk about speed traps and whatnot, 
  snap ...  i guess being 90 million deep has it 's drawbacks . 
  deutsche telekom ag now own the old romtelecom network in romania and the offer a very `` middle of the road '' [ 500mbps for 8.5 eur ] ( https://www.telekom.ro/fix/internet-l.html ) trough a gpon fiber box that also caries hd channels , sd channels and voip . 
  that 's why i said everyone of those people over 18 years of age , should have the option to renounce their statute as eu citizens , if they so chose . 
  precisely why they should have left it up to the citizens themselves individually to renounce their eu citizenship in person , and everybody born as an eu citizen should only be eligible to renounce that quality when they turn 18 !, 
  therefore all eu brits should be treated as a european minority living in a foreign country but still enjoying their status as eu citizens and empowering the eu to enforce their rights on uk soil as any other country could do and as russia does when their minorities in certain caucasus nations get `` discriminated '' . 
  those brits that wish to remain eu citizens ** are eu citizens ** and their wellbeing and right to selfdetermination should be a european priority !, 
  if brexit is a divorce , the most valuable assets are in human capital . 
  the brits born in the last 42 years are eu citizens and nothing has the right to change that under any circumstances other than by individual filing for abandonment of status . 
  precisely why i said `` back '', 
  i meant  scotland and ni would likely ** get ** a sort of `` express accession '' and for the issue of viable , i really do n't see why not . 
  there are numerous small independent states in the eu . 
  they could be like san marino is to italy or monaco to france . 
  no ... this is all on us . 
  yes , a distribution center  they would all flee to the west with ids bought from similar looking gypsys . 
  the purposely made it taller  so ... yes, 
  back to being her majesty 's loyal subjects , and being subjected to all kinds of unsupervised pleberey , in a godforsaken place , from where the european union court of justice can no longer hear your screams ... , 
  i do n't think anybody would complain if the eu bent the rules a bit , just to spite the english and break up the kingdom ... scotland and ni would likely get a sort of `` express accession '' which is only fair seeing as how you ca n't very well scrutinize a bunch of people on their worthiness to be eu citizens , when they used to be eu citizens last week . 
  a sizable chunk of that were standing around being teenagers and watching their future being stolen away from them by sad old unaccomplished morons . 
  i make this statement basted on proof that gypsies were recruited and paid 60 pounds a day by `` someone '' to camp out all over london and turn everybody 's nose with their inelegant ways , all the while being protected and shepherded by the metro police rather than rounded up and sent home , as it had been don in paris , rome , berlin etc. 
  everything was engineered and it smells that way even now . 
  so if `` fat finger warnings '' did this ... what do you expect of march when they file ? 
  or march 2019 when you 're out ? 
  the gchq bandits just ran a train on all of you to avoid being neutered by the formation of a european central intelligence agency . 
  and judging from her post referendum statement , her majesty wanted this . 
  they just fooled you in to shooting both feet off by throwing away your eu citizenship and enrolling back in to english serfdom . 
  no matter how bad this gets , there 'll be somebody there to say `` it 's the british way to go on wit a decision , however stupid it might be ''  there 's no point in struggling , they do n't care how much this hurts you , they just want to keep power , as is with all dynasties . 
  off you go now ... 
  the pound is now 18 % less in ron ( romanian leu ) . 
  23.06.2016 ** 1 gbp = 6.2 ron ** 07.06.2016 ** 1 gbp = 5.1 ron ** minimum wage workers in the uk make ** 7.2 gbp/hour ** that comes to ** 1152 gbp/month ** which in july was ** 1587 eur . 
  1152 gbp ** today is ** 1320 eur ** , so ** 267 eur/231 gbp ** a month less . 
  ** 231 gbp out of 1152 gbp is 20.0 % !, 
  less purchasing power in eur .

   i 'm sure the romanians are proud of themselves . 
  they were provoked by those barbershop idiots , for simply standing in a parking lot across the street from his shop . 
  they started it by attacking one of the romanians , and fell pray to a time honored romanian peasant conflict resolution tactic , of coming back with overwhelming force and doing a disproportionate amount of damage . 
  and my unified theory , that all euroskeptics are just laddish undersexed morons in cheap polyester suits payed for with laundered rubles , keeps getting validated . 
  you did it wrong ... you 're supposed to do `` romanians are '' and the first suggestion is `` gypsies '' . 
  when i type in `` britanicii sunt '' ( the british are ) in google.ro , i get only the one suggestion : ** `` cine sunt britanicii '' ( who are the british ) . 
  ** however , when i type `` englezii sunt '' ( the english are ) i get a list with : ** 1 . 
  the english are catholic . 
  the english are stupid . 
  the english are racist . 
  the english are phlegmatic . 
  **  so it 's not just me then ... ** edit ** : [ proof ] ( https://anonmgur.com/up/246fa69a5a65b157a5ecfaa89d0dec41.png ), 
  the romans were kinda cool ... 
  rt sometimes posts shit about russia . 
  mimicking impartiality is necessary . 
  he 's lying !, 
  it 's a joke ... there 's no oil in romania . 
  god bless america !, 
  * dude stfu !, 
  the russian oligarchy ... they should start packing . 
  only in countries where the russians bought a majority stake in the low hanging media outlets trough qatar based investment funds . 
  attitude implantation , opinion molding and reaction conditioning are the key to delivering populist nationalist centric euroskeptic propaganda , to the vulnerably unintelligent underclass . 
  it 's also worth noting that russian penetration of these media markets in europe , takes place with the help of predominantly british legman who legitimize these beachheads and have proven to be russia 's most loyal collaborators . 
  ( see the sky news eastern european arms dealers frame-up ), 
  that 's a ridiculous way to look at it . 
  if the fruit pickers and general laborers living 10 to house and paying 3000 a month for a house , ** are going to leave ** , not directly because brexit so much as because the pound will likely dip below the eur and they 'll all find themselves earning much less in the uk than they could somewhere else in the eu . 
  against the romanian ron the pound is now worth 17.8 % less than it was before the referendum . 
  and also , i think a major plus for young people was making a small down-payment on a house and renting it to immigrants at a 7-10 % yield and getting on the property ladder in 10 years by doing nothing . 
  i wish i could * buy to let * a house to 10 polish people and just find my self a homeowner in 10 years , like many who did this in 2004 are now sittin pretty on , 300.000 . 
  feeling trapped , in a country with a majority of unreasonable people who gobble up nationalist populist baseless self glorification adorning of a long forgotten global significance and being the victim of international social and financial devolution as a result of a leadership with diplomatic aspergers who just wo n't play well with others ? 
  congratulations , you 're russian !, 
  if they file for art 50 in march , it 's likely many will leave the city because of banking passporting and a variety of other factors .
