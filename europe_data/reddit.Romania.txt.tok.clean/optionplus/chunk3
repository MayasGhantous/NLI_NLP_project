  is n't it very likely property will drop dramatically in about 6 months ? 
  why would you risk feeling like one of those people who bought property in america , the week before lehmann fell . 
  `` special relationship '', 
  when they stop paying rent and those buy to let properties get defaulted on , there 's no going back . 
  good luck with trying to get the cast of benefits street out in the orchards , you 'll be paying # 7 for an apple , and that 's before they unionise and get drunk for a few years , as is tradition . 
  this is such a good idea . 
  look at how well it worked out for the others , i ca n't even think of a country with more power and global significance than scotland or wales . 
  i hear sometimes , if they ask really nicely , they actually get permission to have a referendum on issues that concern them . 
  * for stargate sg1 fans , the english are like the [ aschen ] ( http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/aschen ) . 
  no one really hates russians ( i hope ) they hate the bolshevik nomenclature and the covert cunts hiding in the eu behind mountains of stolen rubles . 
  if the russians would get rid of certain political personalities in similar fashion to how we got rid of ceausescu , everybody would be buying them drinks at the pub . 
  no one should be judged on the actions of his piece of shit government . 
   you can browse removed stuff by their tags , however . 
  i did n't know that , thanks . 
   if you could change something in the subreddit , what would it be ? 
  next to the `` hot , new , rising , controversial , top , gilded , wiki , promoted '' there should be a ** `` trash '' ** category for all the removed posts . 
  for the record , it 's not actually `` uk hate '' , so much as it is hate of euroskepticism as a whole , of which the uk just happens to be the baton twirling front man . 
  the hypocritical similarities between the eu and the uk as supranational entities where what 's good for the gander is not good for the goose , are just unfortunate coincidences that make this request of being returned sovereignty , an ineligible pretension , if expected without it also involving the return of sovereignty for scotland , wales , and northern ireland . 
  the whole country just axed a white continent in favor of closer ties with the asia-subcontinent . 
  well , if you had read some of those `` biased comments '' , you would have seen that first and foremost i do n't subscribe to the politically engineered notion of `` british '' people and the `` british state '' as a whole . 
  it 's just england being england and the subsequent victims surrounding the phenomenon . 
  and if i remember correctly , the issue of cyprus has more to do with part of the island being your mediterranean falkland , of sorts . 
  can you really be surprised at their attitude ? 
  that was before jihadi john ... now they might have rubber gloves on when you get there . 
  so the other western eu countries should just absorb your share of economic migrants from the est ? 
  the idea is , you 're picking the best and leaving more of the `` not so best '' for the other eu members who might feel as though you are n't caring your fare share but expecting equal dividends . 
  so there are no polish people being murdered anywhere for being polish and nothing more ? 
  or is that invisible hostility ? 
  it 's the largest wealth transfer in history . 
  yes , my german power company who bought the communist infrastructure for $ 1 made a lot of money off of us . 
  what 's your point ? 
  euroskeptik nuclear powers and former empires with big foreign policy ambitions and an intelligence apparatus to go with it , and a history of oppressing their neighbors and forcing their language and culture on them , now yearning for a long since extinguished significance and hoping to reignite the flames of glory by nationalist centered reforms and no longer being willing to play nice with others ? 
  there are no similarities here are there ? 
   the shed loads of cash , some twisted jack booted fantasy where you finally get to be the boss please ... we get to have poorly built motorways by shady eu companies , all that money goes west . 
  for us the eu was always first and foremost a sanctuary from the evil empire . 
  the hypocrisy for one ... and then there 's the cherry picking freedom of movement thing . 
  you keep thinking you have 27 ears to piss brexit in , what evidence do you have of anyone dealing with you as anything other than a unified front ? 
  remember when obama said a brexit would bring putin 's great joy ? 
  well , we ca n't very well sit back and let you become part of putin 's harem , now can we ? 
  who knows what you 'll do out of post-brexit desperation , you 're already his bottom bitch in the west , look at how mothing came of that litvinenko spectacle ... look at who owns your football clubs and media conglomerates . 
  you 've been burning your candle at both ends for quite a while now , but as is wit all things , this too shall end . 
  by a young king who got booted a few months later . 
  we were never neutral . 
  because spain is big : / ? 
  can they still call it sovereignty if they have to negotiate their position from the eu ? 
  eu satellite nations are as sovereign as warsaw pact nations , were in russia 's sphere of influence . 
  not part of the actual ussr , but not exactly sovereign either . 
  something the size of england with it 's 007 perfidious albion running around , can never be allowed unchecked power in european orbit . 
  either they bow down and have their gchq become an open book to the eu , or a cold war between us and them starts out the moment they try to make `` global friends '' without asking us first . 
  i know it sounds very obnoxious , but this is how the sausage is made . 
  it 's just taunting and banter ... 
  if there 's a buck to be saved or made people find a way to get over frustrations pretty quickly . 
  but nothing will save you from the shit storm that 's about to come from companies in the uk trying to get something out of this brexit and bending you over a barrel to get it . 
  this is nothing , after they actually leave , people who already own british brands might find their cars vandalized , just because ... 
   would you also argue that northern ireland is part of the republic of ireland rather than the uk since they play international rugby as part of the republic ? 
  well , when you make my argument for me ... 
  as a first row witness to the referendum outcome that saw the sterling devalued 17 % in 90 days , you should have a better answer to the question of how much the `` economic problems '' weigh in balance with reactionary emotional decision making . 
  as i 've said many times on here , the real damage of this brexit will make itself announced when the legal and economic conclusion is neatly folded , and the lack of solidarity and sympathy from eu citizens and customers begins . 
  however , the individual sense of nationalism at the root of support for those teams , is not * retarded * is it ? 
  you see , scots do n't have to identify as more european than british , they just have to identify as more scottish than british and the paradigm changes . 
  with their quality as european citizens removed and without access to the european court of appeals , you could argue that the scottish people themselves have been devolved against their clearly expressed vote . 
  i know . 
  that international recognition was made quite evident to me , when i saw the `` british '' football team play in the euro 2016 this summer , instead of the less internationally recognized format with separate teams for scotland , northern ireland , wales and england . 
   he uk was a merging of formerly separate kingdoms and governments into one . 
  like the russian kingdom merged with the kingdom of crimea . 
  well that unconventional sense is about to take a massive hit . 
  it 's funny how whenever brexit post are discussed here 99 % of the ** `` ok guys i know it sucks but let 's just go with it '' ** are claiming to be remainers for a flagrant and shameless play for credibility . 
  the same seems to be true on the scottish and northern irish issue , all of a sudden everyone embracing brexit is a scott who voted remain , but are now doing the `` good sport '' routine and are calling for falling in line with the english choice . 
  how so ? 
  you do realize that the united kingdom is just a supranational block of multiple nations , just like the eu is , right ? 
  by your logic , it 's also absurd for the uk to leave the eu because 52 % of ~ 12 % of the eu 's population voted for it . 
   prime minister theresa may said she will listen to scotland 's concerns over britain 's exit from the european advertisement union but that the devolved scottish government will not have a veto over the brexit negotiations . 
   scotland wants to have more detail about how the british government plans to leave the eu to prevent a `` hard brexit '' that would severely damage the economy , scottish first minister nicola sturgeon said on tuesday . 
   after britain 's vote to leave the eu , sturgeon said scotland may seek another independence referendum - something that could split the world 's fifth largest economy apart just as it attempts to go it alone outside the european bloc . 
   `` what i am very clear about is that , as we look into these negotiations , we will fully engage the scottish government in the discussions that we have , in preparing what position the uk is going to take , '' may told bbc scotland . 
   when asked directly if scotland could have a veto over brexit , may said : `` the united kingdom will have a position in the negotiations and we , as a united kingdom government , will be negotiating with the european union . '', 
   may added that the united kingdom 's government would listen to and take account of the particular concerns of scotland and other parts of the united kingdom , which is made up of england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
   the united kingdom 's devolved parliaments could complicate or slow an eu withdrawal as their remit over such a major change is unclear and there is a convention for giving the assemblies a say on matters that concern them . 
   scots rejected independence in a 2014 referendum . 
  but in the referendum on eu membership on june 23 , scots voted to stay in the bloc while england and wales opted to leave . 
   `` there are two questions you can ask about a second [ independence ] referendum in scotland : one , ` could there be ? ', 
  and that 's a process issue , '' may said . 
   `` i think the real question is ` should there be another referendum in scotland ? ', 
  my answer to that is overwhelmingly ` no ' , '' she said . 
  `` there should not be second referendum in scotland . '', 
  that was 2014 , there 's only 1 million of us in in italy and by now the refugees surely outnumber us . 
  it wo n't let me see the first link , i think it 's country locked . 
  what is it about ? 
  i think you might have some brexit driven insecurity issues . 
  as far as i know , not everyone in europe gets paid in `` 10 euro an hour '' minimum wages , ( particularly brits ) . 
  and as a brit , honestly , you do n't get to accuse anyone of putinism as some islander living on a rock in the atlantic where the russians launder money , manage football clubs , and spike tea cups with polonium . 
  as it turns out , people do n't like to commute 2 hours to some factory in a field where they 're expected to work like salt mine horses for 8 hours for 250 euro a month , ( 1.56 eur/hour ) . 
  they should have a scared straight program where benefit `` queens '' and `` kings '' from western countries get sent to a small town in romania for a month , where they play a game to see what it 's like to work yourself to exhaustion for the privilege of being broke . 
  there 's also a catch , if you get sick you die . 
  i bet they 'll have a new found respect for those minimum wage 10 eur an hour jobs back home ... 
  we 're really happy to get these because we 're otherwise still rocking the half a century old mig21s . 
  that guy in iceland should really get off his ass already ... 
  they sure do n't make'em like they used to ... 
  in 1994 i got a used 1988 [ atari pc3 8088 ] ( http://www.trevisorc.it/ataripc3/index_htm_files/88.jpg ) from germany , and it booted up and posted in to norton commander when i last powered it up in 2013 , right before i threw it out while cleaning the garage to make more room for pickles . 
  about two weeks later , i randomly came across the fact that complete units with the original orange monitor like mine was , were selling to vintage computer collectors on ebay , ** for 2000 euros ** ...
