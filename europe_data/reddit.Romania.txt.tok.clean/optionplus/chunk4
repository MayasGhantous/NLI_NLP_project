   to give them more local control . 
  like a pimp gives his hoes some of the money back for tampons and condoms . 
   it was some underpaid army guy catering to autistic kids from europe as a gig on the side . 
  it was a mercenary/handler like they have in donetsk . 
  you know ... like the underpaid army guy catering to autistic kids who shot down an airliner with 300 people in it . 
  400 firecrackers would have added up to 40 sticks of dynamite !, 
  asshole !, 
  stop trying to downplay this shit and read the phone call transcripts . 
  are you serious ? 
  that was like 60 + % women and a bunch of skinny jeans wearing douchebags . 
  hvim are being given training with explosives and bragged about hiding food in the woods . 
  what you show there seems to be the same species of harmless altruist activist like to `` occupy '' and 99 % variety . 
  [ good luck with google translate ] ( http://www.riseproject.ro/documentar-autonomie-si-petarde/ ), 
  soros 's assholes do n't run around like undersexed paramilitary bomb building cunts . 
  they were caught red handed the day before they planned to detonate bombs hidden in sidewalk trash cans during a crowded street gathering on december 1st 2015 ( romania 's national day ), 
  rise is credible . 
   two of them , were caught last year trying to build cell phone detonated bombs with gun powder from hundreds of high power fireworks . 
  they literally confessed to being in moldova somewhere around transnistria where they received training from russian explosives experts . 
  so , yeah , they are certainly fucking terrorists . 
   any proof for this or another `` cia created isis '' type conspiracy ? 
  there 's an animation showing how moscow based ong 's are paying jobbik politicians to attend bogus elections in places like abchazia , donetsk and crimea where they legitimize the theatrics as `` impartial international observers '' . 
   after googling jobbik , i found this . 
  apparently your google does n't show the myriad of news articles from 2014 when the founding father of jobbik `` bella kovacs '' was uncovered by his own government as a 20 year veteran kgb agent spying on the eu for russia . 
   so , you claim hungary 's third largest party is sponsoring terrorists ? 
  ( forget about being ` russian intelligence agency 's ) . 
  not just jobbik , the hungarian government , trough multiple non profits , funds all extremist organizations in romania , serbia , ukraine and slovakia , while these non profits are funded exclusively by the hungarian government with hungarian public funds . 
   is there any country which added them to their terrorist list ? 
  two of them , were caught last year trying to build cell phone detonated bombs with gun powder from hundreds of high power fireworks . 
  when their trial is over , romania will be the first to do so . 
  who said anything about joining the republic ? 
  are you so far gone as to not even realize they could be a self governed independent nation as well as part of the european union ? 
  and i 'm about as close to romania as you are right now , 
  if i remember correctly , the same trustworthy polls were saying that remain would win ... just to put things in perspective ... in northern ireland the minimum wage is now lower by about 250 eur than it is across the fence in the republic , and all because of your english brexit . 
  how long do you think it 'll be until the people start to have strong opinions about the eu ? 
  they voted to remain ** in a european britain ** no one voted to trap themselves back under english tyranny . 
   why should an entire country be subjected to living under the rules and regulations forced on them by a useless union of unelected bureaucrats , such as having a unified currency and forfeiting local powers in favor of representation in a union parliament ? 
  that 's what brexiters like to say about the eu ... until you realize that for the northern irish and scottish people the `` useless union '' is the united kingdom and the currency they 're forced to live with is the sterling pound , all the while being denied local powers for a few cushioned chairs in westminster . 
  they 're not part of any ** country ** , they are in and of themselves ** countries ** , part of a ** union ** of countries known as the ** united ** kingdom . 
  the hypocrisy just keeps going and going ... 
  and what exactly is it that they spoke ? 
  i 'm particularly curious about the people of northern ireland and scotland . 
  our greatest scientific minds have been working on this plan for decades , our recent small scale experiments with cats have been very promising , all we can do now is hope ... to capture the attention of all the gipsy at once , and point the dot to france or england . 
  fun fact , `` pula '' is the vulgar terminology used by romanians when referring to male genitalia . 
  `` highly attractive '' as a laundromat for oligarchs , not investment . 
  by way of privatization , 
  because positive news about the uk are so easy to find nowadays ... for 3 years leading up to the referendum all of europe had to watch news footage of brazen idiocy and viscerally hateful claims about their country their people or the eu as a whole . 
  now you 're surprised at everyone finding it interesting to watch this blow up all over your face ? 
  from some of us it was to be expected , because farage took our name in vain every chance he had since 2013 , but seeing scandinavians shit on you on here is priceless . 
  you have to keep in mind that the sentiment would have been quite different if it had been 52 to 48 the other way around ... i guess you just have to get used to people up voting the less positive news about you for a while . 
  everybody lost their shit when goldman sachs hired jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , turns out it was just the eu planing ahead . 
  now on with phase 2 . 
  adopting legislation that makes it illegal for non ethnic latvians to hold public office or executive positions in any government agency . 
   the biggest english speaking country in the eu lol  * ahem * , germany , * ahem *, 
  it 's largely because of [ what happened with the hungarian gypsy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e26xukmkmp8 ) asking for asylum in canada . 
  if yow were some random country , yes , that 's how it works . 
  but you 're not !, 
  you 're a banking ** economy ** like switzerland 's !, 
  well some of these hopeful `` people '' are replying out of a euroskeptic reflex , and so far none of them have proved me wrong . 
  so here : 22.06.2016 eur - gbp exchanges 1.30 to 1 22.09.2016 eur - gbp exchanges 1.13 to 1 22.09.2016 usd - gbp exchanges 1.46 to 1 22.09.2016 usd - gbp exchanges 1.27 to 1 22.06.2016 ron - gbp exchanges at 6.2 to 1 22.09.2016 ron - gbp exchanges at 5.1 to 1 3 months = ** 13.3 % to 17.7 % ** drop in value depending on currency . 
  stop trying to downplay this shit !, 
  neighboring countries dig continuous 1 meter wide ditch around hungarian border and fill it with watter . 
  hilarity ensues ... 
  the pound , and therefor the british economy , are now worth ** 17.7 % ** less than they were 85 days ago , this catastrophic crash , is a reflection on the level of confidence the international financial community have in the british economy before the actual filing of art. 50 !, 
  the same international community they left the eu to do more business with . 
  they have an electoral college system , even if he wins he does n't win . 
  and who would they then be mooching a living off of ? 
  russia is a one crop economy , without our gas money , they go back to hunting and gathering . 
  $ 0.0085 is $ 8.704 per gb !, 
  what a bunch of bullshit !, 
  that 's like 45 minutes of youtube at 1080p . 
  it 's actually unlimited , 30gb are just what you get at a guarantied speed . 
  but even when it starts throttling , you can still watch youtube at 1080p without problems and at night after 12:00 it no longer throttles you till 07:00 . 
  the pound exchange rate . 
  so could all of europe buy our rds `` optim nelimitat '' plans which have unlimited texts calls and data for 5.81 eur , and use them from wherever they are ? 
  so , salaries , property values , stocks , all are worth 17.7 % less ... but no biggie , `` major effect '' only starts at 17.8 % . 
  how exactly are they different if i bought pounds with my euros so that i could buy stock in a british company , and now relative to what my purchase was , i have something worth 17.7 % less euros ? 
  wee should just abolish the idea of workers as employees . 
  every single person should be registered as a company , as an entity that does business with other companies and gets paid for services rendered . 
  that way , we stop all the bullshit . 
  an eastern european ca n't go to london to provide his services as a construction worker , but a london architect should be able to work providing his services to eastern europe , because he calls himself `` nigel the architect '' llc and therefor can have access to the eu market ? 
  all european workers should be re classified as services providing companies in and of themselves . 
  no more employee and employee contracts , just one company doing business with another . 
  they 're already going for this in the uk , with 0 hour contracts and work placement agencies . 
  good !, 
  i always wanted a halal bmw . 
  my calculation now shows it 's 17.7 % , i was stuck on 12 because that 's what it was the day after the referendum . 
  the pound being worth 17.7 % less means all the money invested in british actives is now worth 17.7 % less . 
  so please spare me the regurgitated ukip-ist delusions . 
  every dollar euro or yen that went to london before june the 23rd , ** is now worth 17.7 % less !, 
  these positive headlines are planted and propped up so as to steady things in the perception of uk stocks value , just before they take out another pint in this slow and quiet bleed where everyone is pretending everything is all good and steady to avoid loosing even more than the 12 % they already lost , or possibly push the theatrics even further to where they gain back some of what they lost , so they can yank it out and run as far away from london as possible , before the filing of article 50 . 
  ** edit : it 's actually 17.7 % not 12 % **, 
  if you look close enough at that photo , you can actually see putin 's dickcheese in the corner of her mouth . 
  the tide is high and i 'm holding on ... 
  they 're waiting for elections in america , russia , france and some other places . 
  now we finally know what the yellow on our flag stands for , ** banana republic !, 
  :d sorry about that . 
  fixed it . 
  makes sense . 
  bulgaria and greece are eu members , why the f *** would they need an internal fence . 
  they need policy enforcement a strong coast guard and an eu deal with turkey .
