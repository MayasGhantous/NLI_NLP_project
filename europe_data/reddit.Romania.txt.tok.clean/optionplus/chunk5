  on option is , for them to only have access to the market with no banking passports and regulated investments in eu space , but only if they allow freedom of movement like norway , switzerland and iceland . 
  if they do n't allow freedom of movement , they should be like russia is for us now . 
  a country we reluctantly do business with , big , strong , nuclear , and at the same time neutered and powerless because of it 's own imperialist ambitions , nationalist centric views and overwhelmingly under the control of a intelligence community run oligarchy . 
  so far it 's looking like it 's leaning toward the second option , i only hope we wont end up feeling as sorry for the brits as we do the russians being trapped and starved in russia by a arrogant government who diminishes its own people because it just does n't play well with others . 
  i 'm not , history is . 
  none of that indecisive agnostic bullshit for italy , romania or malta ... ,

  well ... we have to leave for `` richer '' places , we do n't enjoy the luxuries like living in rent free council houses and having our kids fed by `` food banks '' while we 're out and about spending the weekly child benefit and job seekers money on cans of beer and heroin . 
  it might cost us the company of loved ones , health , happiness and dignity , but some might say , that 's the more honorable way to live life . 
  it 's called `` making sacrifices in comfort for the sake of personal gain '' . 
  something that entitled council estate brexit legumes will never understand . 
  there 's nothing to stop two european countries from military collaboration , so what 's to stop 27 ? 
  we can just call it the `` continental european defense partnership '' instead of the european army . 
  well , you 're the one who posted it , so you tell me ... 
  yes , the member berries are a spoof on the melancholic garbage that they feed to populists in america to get them to vote for trump . 
  we 're eating member berries here in europe now ? 
  i know you 're a little bit anxious about finally being an independent country yourselfs , but there 's really no need to lose composure in all this . 
  i think it 's only fair you loose absolutely everything you gained in the last 42 years .

  why are uk politicians having opinions about our business ? 
  at most , they should understandably abstain from participation , but to veto something that no longer concerns their future , is just asking for a spanking . 
  why bother , kali linux is already free, 
  it 's immoral to take advantage of impressionable kids , by conditioning them to throw tantrums in supermarkets , demanding their parents buy them the salami with the little clown on it , like the kid they saw on tv was eating . 
  without hitler hovering over ferdinand porsche 's shoulder , i really do n't see how . 
  i think the same thing will happen tat happened in the uk . 
  ads with ** animated families **, 
  things were getting pretty ridiculous with almost 99 % of all food ads being about some little kid doing a bite and smile .

  while there 's no doubt europe wo n't allow russia to keep the island , i 'm not sure how quickly everyone would jump to the rescue .

  putin is basically the ceo of a charity that takes peasant morons that grew up shitting in an outhouse at minus 30 , and emancipates them to a life of gold painted yaht toilets in the warmth of the mediterranean . 
  in exchange they play pretend to work toward some big retaliatory comeback of what the evil empire used to be . 
  little do they know ... 
  you know we 're not all part of that visegrad circlejerk , right ? 
  it 's just the polish-hungarian-slovak-czech moscow connection and amateur scatofilia enthusiasts club . 
  people still refuse to see the origin of the well of euroskepticism being somewhere near the volga river . 
  i want a european army with popular support , so that 5 minutes after its inception they can use the terrorist migrant excuse to declare martial law over the eu , turning this in to a military dictatorship that picks up from where the nazis peaked , and does to the individual national politicians and high ranking administrators what the nazi did to jews and the rroma . 
  look at those bubbles and mentally wipe the borderlines out and you 'll see the future of the eu . 
  sovereign municipalities as part of a federal european union , without nation states or national parliaments and the greatest civic society in the world .

  well , to be fair , they started it !, 
  for hundreds of thousands of years , our kind died by the fangs of some animal chasing us around and in to the caves . 
  in relative terms , they ate a lot more of us than we have of them . 
  and is n't there proof that a meat rich diet was instrumental in our brain development , making us the most intelligent in the kingdom ?

  he already apologized and said he was put in an awkward position and that he was simply trying not to offend . 
  and what prey tell might those other delivery media be ? 
  obviously keeping in to consideration the scale of sustainably feeding seven billion of us , every day . 
  but you need meat , you do n't need to steal shit ... 
   not sure if trolling  well think about it ... you know for a fact that not eating animal protein significantly increases the chance of having severe health problems , yet for whatever reason you still deny yourself meat , because , what ? 
  the poor little animals are just too cute to eat ? 
  that 's about figuring out if veganism or vegetarianism cause mental problems , not if they in and of themselves are mental problems . 
  * and in short , yes they do something to brain chemistry among other things and promote a susceptibility for the onset of clinical depression, 
  here :  compulsive behavior and/or mental preoccupation regarding affirmative and ** restrictive dietary practices ** believed by the individual to promote optimum health . 
  and here :  dietary restrictions escalate over time , and may come to include ** elimination of entire food groups ** edit : are you implying there are two flavors of vegetarians , one who morally objects eating meat and another who thinks it 's the healthier nutritional choice ? 
  does n't denying yourself meat because of emotional inadequacies in dealing with how meat is obtained , sound like something that might have a psychological contingent to it ? 
  it lists the recently ( 2016 ) published diagnostics criteria !, 
  you do n't have medical journals publishing diagnostics criteria for something unless the medical community is decidedly focusing on it as an actual issue . 
  the dsm is like the fda , it takes time to chisel something like this into stone . 
  but although there are some exceptions and hold offs a clear definition of orthorexia is currently being shaped , with a stated diagnostic criteria having only recently been submitted . 
   in 2016 , formal criteria for orthorexia were proposed in the peer-reviewed journal eating behaviors by authors thom dunn , phd of the university of northern colorado , and steven bratman . 
  [ 11 ] these criteria are as follows :  criterion a. 
  obsessive focus on `` healthy '' eating , as defined by a dietary theory or set of beliefs whose specific details may vary ; marked by exaggerated emotional distress in relationship to food choices perceived as unhealthy ; weight loss may ensue , but this is conceptualized as an aspect of ideal health rather than as the primary goal . 
  as evidenced by the following : compulsive behavior and/or mental preoccupation regarding affirmative and restrictive dietary practices believed by the individual to promote optimum health . 
  ( footnotes to this criteria add : dietary practices may include use of concentrated `` food supplements . '', 
  exercise performance and/or fit body image may be regarded as an aspect or indicator of health . ), 
  violation of self-imposed dietary rules causes exaggerated fear of disease , sense of personal impurity and/or negative physical sensations , accompanied by anxiety and shame . 
  dietary restrictions escalate over time , and may come to include elimination of entire food groups and involve progressively more frequent and/or severe `` cleanses '' ( partial fasts ) regarded as purifying or detoxifying . 
  this escalation commonly leads to weight loss , but the desire to lose weight is absent , hidden or subordinated to ideation about healthy food . 
   criterion b. 
  the compulsive behavior and mental preoccupation becomes clinically impairing by any of the following : malnutrition , severe weight loss or other medical complications from restricted diet intrapersonal distress or impairment of social , academic or vocational functioning secondary to beliefs or behaviors about healthy diet positive body image , self-worth , identity and/or satisfaction excessively dependent on compliance with self-defined `` healthy '' eating behavior . 
   a diagnostic questionnaire has been developed for orthorexia sufferers , similar to questionnaires for other eating disorders , named the orto-15 . 
  [ 14 ] however , the above cited article by dunn and bratman critiques this survey tool as lacking appropriate internal and external validation . 
  the name of the disorder is ** orthorexia ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthorexia_nervosa https://www.fastcompany.com/3041330/body-week/the-newest-eating-disorder-to-maybe-enter-dsm-orthorexia https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/orthorexia-eating-clean-eating-disorder + @ u/arcamfmj, 
  vegetarianism and veganism have recently been classified by the medical community as ** mental illnesses ** . 
  they are now part of a category known as ** `` nutritional anxiety disorders '' ** alongside conditions such as bulimia and anorexia . 
  even in legal terms , vegetarianism and , veganism are officially considered self harm , or abuse . 
  in many parts of the world , denying animal protein to your child or any other person or even animal in your care , it is now considered abuse , and if proven to have been the underlining cause for degraded health issues such as anemia or complications do to lowered immunity , it can lead to actual jail time . 
  lately i 've noticed that all the music videos on tv , are about some young bimbo smoking or slowly realising smoke from her mouth in a seductive fashion . 
  regulatory limitations have kicked behavioral placement out of movies and tv series , but not music videos . 
  a tabaco company can not grow without another generation of customers , so naturally they focus exclusively to getting young impressionable people to think of smoking in a very artificiality romanticised way . 
  if they pray on kids and we impose a law that makes it illegal to sell to new kids , we would have effectively shut their shit down . 
  wtf is an \u00e2 \u0179 ? 
  rds ( romania data systems ) the ones with the [ gigabit fiber for 10 eur a month ] ( http://www.rcs-rds.ro/internet-digi-net/fiberlink?t=internet-fix&amp;pachet=digi_net_fiberlink_1000 ) , has already spread in to hungary and i think bulgaria as well but i 'm not sure . 
  even if it costs the eu a ** trillion ** , that averages out to 2.222 eur per person , or about 10 % of average eu gdp per capita . 
  but on a less ridiculous note ... an impact of say 10 billion , ( which is what the uk contributed ) comes to a whopping ** 0.06 eur per day ** per eu citizen ... 
  so they need to calm their tits , we 'll be alight . 
  i was more pointing to the phrasing of that title . 
  `` eu rules promise 100mbps broadband for all '' not `` at least '' , or `` a minimum of '' 100mbps . 
  so they 're gon na cut ours down to a tenth ? 
  i 've seen them interviewed on many occasions , and although second generation brits the still had a thicker accent than apu from the simpsons . 
  many openly admitting to having voted out , so they could bring over more family members from the subcontinent . 
  publicly from official dignitaries and tough media channels . 
  pissing on each others leg at world wide urinal , is hardly the same thing . 
   indian and ukip adviser is that like a nazi rabin ? 
  all i know is , we never point at them , ever , and they 're exclusively preoccupied with trying to pull our pants down in public every month or so , since 1990 .
