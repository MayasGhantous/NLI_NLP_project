  but it still feels nice to randomly throw diplomatic darts at a neighboring country for no reason whatsoever , right ? 
  remember when they found those suffocated migrants in a chicken truck ? 
  it took them all of 5 seconds to put out a statement that the driver was romanian , which turned out to be a lie, 
  please ... 
   largest group in the uk is i think the polish . 
  so those are poles making every city in the uk look like a mixture of islamabad and bangladesh ? 
  and i suppose those people running to join isis are also polish . 
  believe it or not , this was exclusively about [ this thing ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/09/13/call-hungary-kicked-out-eu-over-refugee-stance/90298346/ ) that happened yesterday . 
  throwing a dead cat over the fence , or any fence . 
  because you had the audacity to mention immigration concerns being among the reasons some voted leave , despite immigration from those non eu countries being quite substantial and very consequential to quality of life on the island . 
  you have yet to find a local `` polish law '' council anywhere in the country . 
  the hypocrisy is quite pungent to just leave be . 
   calling people you disagree with names is just silly . 
  did you per chance happen to see some news footage showcasing outspoken brexiters lately ? 
   some wanted to limit migration india and pakistan are not eu members , the referendum was about eu membership not immigration . 
  the fact that everybody voted blindly hoping and fantasizing about brexit meaning whatever they imagined it to mean , makes it a very emotional decision . 
  the voting system is not meant to be used as a wishing well by a nation 's dissatisfied uninformed , and evidently uninformable idiocracy . 
  it shows that the lack of reasonable thinking in lieu of emotional decision making . 
  so 160.000.000 a week to you sounds like a litle ? 
  no one is contesting that that is a lot of money , but relative to the number of people the contribution came from the cost of being part of the european union for a uk citizen was an undeniable mathematical reality of 29p a day . 
  remember that big red bus ? 
  it said 350.000.000 a week . 
  but minus the rebate and other subsidies it came to a real figure of 160.000.000 which divided to 65.000.000 divided to 7 comes to 29p . 
  canada , australia and new zeeland have a combined population that 's smaller than that of the uk . 
  but the good news is , when they start to form an oligarchy and fold the lot of you in to a modern form of serfdom , as eu citizens you can demand justice for yourselves from the european union court of justice . 
  oh ... wait ... nevermind . 
  putting up that fence was a very poor decision for a variety of reasons , not the least of which is the fact that they chose to build it out of galvanized steel , in an area with a large population of people genetically predisposed to stealing metal . 
  well the uk was a net contributor of 160.000.000 which comes to all of 30p per person per day . 
  they brexited over something that was costing them a daily stick of gum in taxes . 
  i 'm very curious if all those sticks of gum will actually go to their nhs now . 
  an eu tax like the american federal income tax , will go a long way in to establishing and funding this union as global force to be reckoned with , and not just some to big to fail trade block . 
  it could mean an european army , navy , intelligence agency , health-care system and many other immense advantages . 
  why would it be less in bucharest than cluj ? 
  they do n't make 150 a day ? 
  that 's the current going rate for construction and facade workers here . 
  no no ... 
  i think you misread that . 
  the ** dutch ** are firmly committed to being cunts about romania joining schengen , because they do n't want our black sea opening to mess up their whole `` rotterdam is the greatest port ever '' routine . 
  ** francois hollande ** is the president of france . 
   business minister we said it was n't binding . 
  only advisory . 
   brexit minister we said that when we thought we would lose . 
  now we 've won , it 's binding . 
  on italian road building companies who build motorways that literally crumble after 6 months and then come back to fix them and get hooked on that eu titie again . 
  drive a cab in bucuresti cluj timisoara and you 'll make roughly 1000 eur a month . 
  we should start calling those `` aboriginal romanians '', 
  i 'd be ok with them getting some special rapid deportation powers to get rid of the truly discussing rif-raf like the gypsy and the squatters , just to save face with the ukip-ers . 
  but whatever special exemption they get should be emphasized on deportation and not on denial of entry with no reason . 
  the moment it becomes even mildly more difficult to go to the uk than going to norway , they should have that door slapped in their face and have tariffs imposed . 
  laddish preppies never make for good leadership . 
  they 're overwhelmingly preoccupied with making rash maneuvers , hoping and fantasizing about the subsequent back slapping orgy that comes with bringing home the victory and standing around all humble for the ata-boy 's . 
  people like that are dangerous, 
  about 4 million people left since 1990 , 1 million are in italy , 1.1 million in spain , 700.000 in germany , 350.000 in france 180.000 in the uk , and the rest are scattered around countries like belgium , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , austria , switzerland etc. 
  their leaving and having kids over there or not having kids at all because they 're working , have brought us to where we 're missing an entire piece of the demographic spectrum , between 24 and 44 yo . 
  wow ... 
  when have they started wearing socks ? 
  he must be one of those fancy new ones i heard about , who grew up in italy or france . 
  well the genetics is what i was trying to get to ... perhaps some fortune telling or scrap metal collecting in his lineage ? 
  http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/hungarian-prime-minister-viktor-orban-meets-with-iranian-president-picture-id499406976 he 's browner than even the iranian president hassan rouhani . 
  maybe your monitor is not convening certain tones . 
  that populist undersexed and unreasonable morons , have gotten a thin edge over us lately . 
  i mean look at the other side of the water and the people trying to `` make it great again '' . 
  why is orban so much darker skinned than most other hungarians ? 
  no ... david cameron was supposed to file art. 50 immediately after the referendum , as the first order of business in his first visit to brussels on the 28th of june . 
  instead , he came out of nr .10 the morning of the result on the 24th , and ** resigned ** . 
  russia sometimes forgets how much land it has , and rekindles mongoloid ambitions of westward expansion , they get close enough to `` plant '' a russian minority like a cultural land mine . 
  they later covertly destabilize the nation while at the same time , that minority victimizes itself as oppressed , and that 's cause for russia to come and help `` it 's people '' and then the minority suddenly declares independence , and in the civil unrest , miraculously becomes the majority and the non russian lands with a few russians living on them , suddenly become part of russia . 
  they 've been puling the same shit in crimea , donbas , donetsk , transnistria , georgia , azerbaijan , and so many other places i do n't even remember them all . 
  they think it 's `` soft pushing '' by way of separatist fractioning , but that dog wont hunt no more ... we 'll article five ourselves in to a nuclear holocaust if need be . 
  edit : georgia - abkaz azerbaijan - nagorno-karabakh, 
  so you could all just hang around , outside factory gates , drunkenly chanting `` id rather be a picket than a scab '' like you did in the 70s ? 
  if you dislike the `` inferior '' and `` sub par '' eastern europeans , you have winston churchill to blame , [ i sure do ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentages_agreement ), 
  turkey , 
  your opinion of romanians and hungarians is unfortunate , but as is with all national identities , everything you perceive about a nation is engineered . 
  the best example i can give you is that of japan , which before the second world war , was perceived as the isis or taliban of it 's time . 
  they were culturally ornate ( non christian ) , very indoctrinated , extremist , and even had suicide bombers . 
  the kamikaze . 
  after the us dropped the bomb on them , they concluded that it was the way they were perceived by the western world , that allowed for a justification to use such unprecedented evil against them . 
  they got together with sociologists and admen from the us , and redesigned their national identity form scratch . 
  they demolished every imperialistic looking building and replaced it with an ultra modernist conceptual piece of architecture , ( capsule hotel , tokyo ) to be in trend with their foundation identity , as `` the sunrise country '' ( hence their flag ) . 
  they further interpreted that , by focusing their efforts in industrially relaunching their country , as predominantly technology oriented . 
  they had to be the first to bring new gadgets to market , and any innovation or product was marketed under the supervision of a state department , which controlled every aspect of how that item was advertised and perceived , because it was a matter of national identity not just corporate . 
  this is still going on today with play stations and prius cars . 
  the japanese government , also mandated an army of animators , to produce animations for the american market as a way of reaching the hearts and minds of the next generation of white kids , ( the nintendo and play stations are alternate routs ) who 's opinion of japan is much more positive , from that of someone who lived before the war . 
  they purposely designed the anime characters with oversized eyes , because they had as a foremost image complex , the shape of their elongated eyes . 
  they used to be refereed and ridiculed as `` squinty eyed '' , and they refereed to white people as `` round eye '' . 
  from this they went wit the exact opposite to what they were perceived as , and the anime characters were always drawn with large vertically oval or round oversized eyes . 
  they also used the nuclear subject to influence opinion on radiation damage and exposure , by making a few anime movies about young people who become superheroes after being exposed to radiation , and films like godzilla , about a lizard exposed to radiation.the underlining message in all these movies , being that radiation exposure ** enhances ** rather than diminishes , and therefore japan is ** stronger ** for it , and not a victim of radiation . 
  they also purposely sent tourists to the us and many western countries , to influence perspective of how japanese people were perceived by others as tourists , they were always smiling , some even had their teeth fixed purposely for this aspect , other were selected for their appearance , and evidently other who were deemed sub par , were denied access to this guerrilla campaign . 
  they always had a very non threatening attitude and demeanor and were always very apologetic and respectful , they toned down every aspect of their image and engineered a purposely put together outfit , that became stereotypical of japanese tourists , something upheld even today . 
  they wear sandals with socks , beige dockers , a hawaiian shirt , a members only jacket , with a piece of japanese made photographic equipment around their necks . 
  they used the hawaiian shirts to subliminally project the similarities between them and the pacific islander americans in hawaii . 
  the various fuji , canon , nikon cameras they wore , were there just to advertise their prowess in that industry . 
  they also heavily penetrated the content production industry in america , and contracted writers from the writers guild , to insert the phrase `` japanese business man '' in almost every movie or tv show made . 
  every time you see something said about japanese people in an american movie , they 're being depicted , almost exclusively , as businessmen . 
  today japan is no longer the oriental taliban , it 's that country where the opinion formulation ministry makes tv shows about men bobbing for apples in a woman 's pubic area , and they make sure to have qwerky cultural embellishments such as having vending machines selling moist underwear worn by young women . 
  they 've gone from rivaling the nazi , to being the cutest nation on earth . 
  ( hello kitty ) but everyone can tell , it 's all engineered and unsubstantiated . 
  the japanese people are trapped in a ridiculous theatrical caricature of themselves , the result of which is , having the highest suicide rate in the world , by far . 
  so please understand that the way you think of romania , has nothing to do with how actual romanians are as people .
