  were simply not advertising ourselves , and the gypsy doing it for us , are causing immense damage to our image . 
  but as soon as all these communists die ... rest assured you 'll think of us in a better way . 
  as a transilvanian , i approve this . 
  i think all these brazen far right political movements that have sprung up around europe lately , are secretly run by the intelligence agencies , as a plot to roundup all the easily radicalized morons in a single pile , and render them inert . 
   statements like these , are just recruiting and profiling pamphlets . 
  i honestly have no idea . 
  it 's easy to win a comparison between the united states * ( plural ) and romania . 
  romania 's gdp is roughly that of south carolina 's . 
  south carolina 's gdp is ranked 27th in the union , so 23 states in america , are beneath romania !, 
  that 's almost half the us . 
  why they still think of romania as a banana republic , i 'll never understand . 
  this seems like a missed opportunity ... why not swap them for something poisonous , and let 'em have it ? 
  first , bernie sanders has a problem with our internet speed , now this . 
  this campaign of theirs , sure has a limited geographic vocabulary . 
  my take on it is ... the seven kingdoms are western europe , the wall is the iron curtain , the wildlings are eastern europeans , the white walkers are russians , the night king is vladimir putin , winter is coming is the cold war . 
  and when the infallible oligarchy of special interest , formed under sovereign freedom , decides to persecute you for being an anti-nationalist , how will you appeal to the european court of justice , if you 've left the european union ? 
  they would be evil together , and for us all , not aiming at each other . 
  and saying `` internal competition is healthy '' is as if a pack of 28 wolfs were to see a herd of rabbits in a valley , and chase each other down there to see who can eat the most . 
  wolfs slowly fan out and sneak around the heard to block every exit , and then work together , ** to eat them all ** . 
  why compete , when you can ** conspire ** ? 
  and what exactly is it you plan on trading with those other countries when we as a poor country can undercut you by two thirds on everything in any market ? 
  is the chinese phenomenon not obvious enough ? 
  when it came to being part of the european union we the 200 million eastern europeans , agreed to stop competing against the interests of the 300 million in the west . 
  we dismantled our industry , to comply with embargo requests from the west . 
  we used to supply the middle east and north african dictatorships with oil extraction and refinery equipment , and armament . 
  we are `` poor '' because we sacrificed everything to be in this community , where we rightfully belong , and where we would have been if not for the fact that we were sold in to soviet slavery at [ yalta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentages_agreement ) . 
  you seem to be one of those people who thinks the european union is a bunch of politicians in bruxelles . 
  the european union is in fact the ** european community ** , ** 508 million people ** sharing ** common european values and ambitions ** . 
  the leave campaign has done a good job of obfuscating this reality , because bureaucrats are easy to hate . 
  if you dislike the direction of the european union , what have you as a european citizen , amply empowered with democratic mechanisms , done to change things ? 
  we are currently ** the largest economy in world ** . 
  to complain about this level of access to prosperity , is ** ludicrous ** . 
  could be ... everybody in germany praises kaufland , but over here it 's complete garbage . 
  [ cbre ] ( http://www.cbre.com/search?k=romania ) i think it 's members only , but the study is there . 
   romania retail marketview h2 2015 february 18 , 2016, 
   last year , 36 new retailers opened stores in the country , 35 of which opened in bucharest . 
  the capital ranked ninth among top ten cities where new retailers opened stores , exceeding cities such as vienna , madrid or paris . 
  shit is ** boomin ** here , but all they show you on the telly , is gypos picking scrap on a dump site , 
  so in about 10 more years italy should be old enough to move out of it 's mother 's house :d just kidding , ** buon compleanno !, 
  i do n't get how they can be the same company and do this ... kaufland has been here for about 12 years , lidl for 5 . 
  what did they think people would say when they brought lidl here ? 
  the difference in quality must have been something they 'd think about when being their own competitors . 
  what is kaufland supposed to be if lidl is best value ? 
  why not re brand all the kaufland 's as lidl ? 
  i do n't get what their identity is supposed to be . 
  those are just grand opening prices  ) it was the same here in 2011 . 
  in romania kaufland is where the soy salami , spongy potatoes , tasteless watermelon , crumbly sawdust toilet paper and watered down dishwashing liquid end up passing as class 1 products . 
  it 's almost completely garbage trough and trough . 
  i think in germany , it 's competition that forces them to those lower prices . 
  in romania , being that * we 're still a developing country * , many households have copious absorbing space for these lifestyle enhancement items , and this communist vacuum of modernism , sucks in almost every accessory for a better more sophisticated life , regardless of cost . 
  [ most accurate one i could find ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcusghfesos&amp;feature=player_detailpage ) ca n't seem to find the one with the ambulances . 
  well that could be because `` ready made '' stuff just does n't sell that well here . 
  it could also have to do with logistics , maybe it costs more to bring certain stuff down here . 
  over here , they gave away free non stick frying pans , in a small town supermarket opening day , and after the outright ** civil war ** that ensued , ambulances had to take away a few bruised pensioners , lying on the gurneys ** with the frying pans still clutched in their hands **  ) it was one of the saddest moments in documented romanian misery . 
  i liked that show , `` 1992 '' ( www.imdb.com/title/tt2983290/ ) you guys had last year . 
  those anti-corruption police officers were a very similar strike force to our dna . 
  even this scandal that shows the involvement of high level corruption in the medical system in italy back then , with the plot being about a young agent ( luca pastore ) on a vengeful journey to take down the company responsible for him contacting hiv trough a contaminated transfusion supplied by mainagi , basically the hexi pharma of italy . 
  it 's a shame really , that none of the romanian tv channels picked up the miniseries . 
  it would be a super hit here . 
  it reminded me about la piovra , which we watched here , almost religiously in the 90s . 
  they have that here too  and looking at the lidl.dk [ brochure ] ( http://tilbudsavis.lidl.dk/cf7ef444-f5bc-420a-846c-89b7470058d1/#/1 ) , that parkside cordless drill with the detachable mandrill , is cheaper in denmark then it is in romania  ) . 
  over there its 279 dkk - 37.5 eur , over here its 199 ron - 44.2 eur , 
  i found out about that from a guy here on reddit  weird how one is selling absolute garbage , and the other one is wiping the floor with the likes of carefour and auchan at prices lower by over 30 % . 
  flaccid apologist politruc . 
  we are the greatest community in the world . 
  lidl is arguably the best value for money option here in romania . 
  the worst being kaufland and profi . 
  lidl has nice themes here , i do n't know if they do this everywhere but in romania they have for example an american week where they sell stuff you do n't find in europe that easily , like twinkies and salisbury stakes . 
  this week is french week , [ here 's an online brochure ] ( http://catalog.lidl.ro/37366b8e-8c84-4033-a2f1-6bf2f884f8c5/#/1 ) that they spam all the apartment buildings with . 
  ( 4.5 lei = 1 eur ) if anyone else has brochures , please link . 
  romania has a much bigger problem than this map suggests . 
  i do n't know how they get data , but if they go by alcohol sales , they do n't factor in romania 's massive moon shine subculture . 
  we have to import plums from other countries , because almost every domestically produced plum , ends up in an improvised home distillery , on it 's way to becoming * \u0163uic\u0103 de prune * . 
  it 's the same here . 
  we do n't have money for heroin but our druggies , are actually alcoholics , drinking bioethanol or some moon shine nonsense until they die of cirrhosis of the liver . 
  this should be `` number of addiction related deaths '' but if we called it that , we 'd have to attach all sugar driven , obesity related heart attacks . 
  would you look at that ... 
  meanwhile , we immigrate to the west , work $ 1000 shit jobs , ** flabbergasted !, 
  ** at what having enough money to comfortably finance an addiction to death , must be like . 
  priorities fyi ... 
  that 's what 's wrong with hybrid warfare , you ca n't even issue the death penalty for treason , because the country is not officially at war . 
  utopia ? 
  i just want the european cities to retain the look of a modern society , with modern , intelligent individuals who have as their foremost preoccupation , a desire to be remarkable contributors for the advancement of human society . 
  not some piece of shit bazar , crawling with sand in the ass crack , double digit iq peasants . 
  without another marshal plan , how about 100 + years ? 
  1000 median ? 
  that 's wrong .

  they 're 80.000.000 stronk  more than half the population of russia . 
  no one wants them as an enemy on a good day , let alone one when you have 60.000.000 ukrainians and all of nato pissed off . 
   `` prior to his death , williams had been conducting financial surveillance on ** illicit cash flows ** out of russia '' you did n't think those oligarchs came there just to own your football teams , did you ? 
  the last [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_gareth_williams ) who started poking around this , ended up leaking out of a duffle bag , into his own bathtub . 
  say , racist much ? , [ much ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=hltjlfgkowk#t=45 ) ? 
  cluj-napoca is second for job optimism , palermo is last . 
  cluj-napoca 's median wage is $ 475 , palermo 's is $ 3500 . 
  conclusion : optimism is relative . 
  the term `` lands '' is relative . 
  a municipality with the freedom to manifest according to it 's own laws is the only form of freedom from the legislative impositions from a centralized national government . 
  why should one municipality ( currently national capital ) have any saying in to the interworkings of a provincial city ?
