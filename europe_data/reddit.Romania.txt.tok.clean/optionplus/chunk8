  at the moment national governments are an archaic ineffective inefficient and costly intermediary . 
  but the countries and their laws would n't matter anymore , with just regional and federal government and nothing in between , would mean the end of all nationalism . 
  no more parliaments , central banks , intelligence agencies , just small independent communities under a federal umbrella . 
  the combined non russian eastern european population ** [ approx 200.000.000 ] ** , plus that of turkey ** [ approx 80.000.000 ] ** . 
  russian population ** [ approx 144.000.000 ] ** that means that even outside the nato context , russia is bordered by neighbors who outnumber them by ** 136.000.000 ** . 
  that 's why you 're supposed to have good relationships with those around you . 
   the countries objecting , mainly on grounds centered on the labeling requirements , are the netherlands , slovakia , austria , bulgaria , czech republic , france , germany , italy , poland , ** romania ** and spain . 
  i had a feeling we 'd be on that list . 
  what about [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lgxk3/eu_as_one_nation/d3na7fb ) ? 
  regional autonomy for every municipal community . 
  i call bullshit on this ... how can romania be the last , when : 1 . 
  connectivity we have ** the fastest ** infrastructure in the eu and one of the fastest in ** the world ** ( top 3 ) 2 . 
  human capital we have the highest number of programmers per capita in ** the world ** 3 . 
  use of internet i do n't know what this means , but we do n't have the fastest infrastructure because we do n't use it . 
  integration of digital technology/public services not happening because to do so would make one million + government employees redundant . 
  keeping the communist bureaucrats on the payroll , or sending them home on hefty pensions , costs the same . 
  in romania some people leave their wifi open 24/7 out of sheer generosity and some out of fear of being blamed for downloading protected content , and by leaving it open , they can say `` hey , it was n't me , somebody must have connected to my internet trough wifi , i do n't even know how this thing works '' , 
  what 'd you expect ? 
  we have the highest number of fiber connected users per capita in the eu , and in the top five in the world . 
  tsipras = = kgbitch, 
  what about a european union as a ** superstate ** , comprised of self governed municipalities , under a set of common values but with culturall , religious , socio-economic liberty , and absolute freedom of travel , ** but conditional freedom of residency ** , and obviously without any national government , just ** a federation of sovereign municipalities ** . 
  haha , that 's so cute . 
  you think if they block torrents , all will happen is , loss of political support  ) is that supposed to happen before or after the ensuing ** riots and mass killings !, 
  i can see this well enough to know to avoid saying `` russians '' whenever bullshit like this pops up . 
  it 's not the russian people being asswholes , its the ** mafia ** comprised of former kgb agents turned oligarchs , now occupying various administration positions in the government . 
  i think people do n't want to see the situation in russia for what it is , ** the russian people are the victims of the kgb oligarchy , just as the germans were victims of the nazi ** . 
  i mean they should form an agency from scratch , complete with a recruiting and training mechanism , so as to avoid having to reuse `` delegated '' personnel from the national services throughout the eu , and to prevent `` contamination '' . 
  young european citizens with zero sense of nationalist patriotism . 
  my laziness has left me humbled yet again , 
  well something must be going well enough , here in cluj ... because i do n't know of any other eu country , where the second largest city has the highest property prices , even more so than the capital . 
  honestly , what we need is a european central intelligence agency . 
  wars have turned hybrid on us , so conventional military thinking just is n't enough anymore . 
  we need competencies for covert involvement , not show of force deterrents . 
  and another one gone , and another one gone another one bites the dust o =( ` - ` q ), 
  our infrastructure runs on concentrated gipsy tears . 
  not after seeing [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4l9qg9/number_of_guns_per_capita_in_europe/ ) . 
  well i guess it would have to be [ that one european nation ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/broadband-internet-download-speeds-worldwide-by-ookla.jpg ) which has ** 9 of the world 's top 15 cities with the fastest broadband ** , and the highest number of fiber connected users per capita in the eu . 
  when i google `` polish '' from my romanian google , all i get back is ads for headlights polishing ** : / **, 
  hooow daaaare you !, 
  so we should get guns just to be safe , and end up living in a east african level of murder rate shithole , so there 'll be less of us around the next time shit hits the fan ? 
  you 'd have to see footage of what happened here in december 1989 , to fully understand why people have an aversion to guns . 
  it 's basically nation-wide ptsd . 
  wow , that 's steep !, 
  over here , owning a gun without a fundamental life defining reason to have a gun , is immediately perceived as mental instability or propensity for criminal ( possibly homicidal ) behavior . 
  you become a pariah . 
  the americans seem to like our aks too , there are thousands of videos on youtube about the wasar 10 . 
  cluj , romania : 3 ron/kilo that 's 0.66 eur , 0.75 usd , 0.50 gpb, 
  that 's just stupid !, 
  we 're nowhere near 0.7 out of 100 , that would mean that there are 7 out of 1000 which sounds ** insane ** for romania . 
  that would mean that over here where i live , in cluj , to a population of 411.000 there should be ** 2877 ** idiots walking around me with guns , right now . 
  even if we take all the hunters , security personnel , and the odd cop with an off duty gun licensee out of that number , it 's still very inflated . 
  i think they forgot a couple of zeros from the more realistic 0.007 . 
  [ romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n24o75gghau ), 
  over here `` dark '' ( economia neagra ) means money from bribes , embezzlement , kickbacks , tax evasion etc. 
  incidentally , in what city are you moving here , and why ? 
  yes , those are called `` gipsy palaces '' the ornate roof lines come from a tradition of sheet metal working by gipsy craftsmen who were renowned for their work in building gutters . 
  they would add multiple roof lines to the house to showcase their skill and have it act as advertisement for everyone passing by . 
  however that ** used ** to be the case . 
  now these monstrosities are associated with gypsies coming back to the village with money made by begging or stealing in western europe . 
  and i assume you show your id when you register , no ? 
  rroma stigmatism is very strong here , as such , this kind of house is viewed as ridiculous . 
  it 's like trying to sell a mosque to a christian priest . 
  it 's kitsch architecture aside , it wont sell because it 's a gipsy house . 
  you 'd have to pay a romanian 500.000 to live there , 
  it 's actually super annoying , every time i do a search for `` cluj '' or `` cluj-napoca '' on reddit , i get a flood of dreamhack sticker talk . 
  wtf are stickers , and why 's everyone putting thousand comments pages about them on here ? 
  i do n't like to disappoint , so [ here  ] ( http://citynews.ro/eveniment/colosul-tiganesc-din-turda-scos-la-licitatie-de-anaf-cu-23-milioane-de-lei-nu-are ) it 's for sale by the romanian government tax authority , for about 500.000 eur since 2006 , but no one will ever buy it  ) . 
  it was confiscated from gabor janos , a local gipsy `` king '' . 
   for the sake of perspective on how much `` dark '' money there is in romania , one of those small 1920 's houses or villas , goes for 350.000-2 .500.000 eur . 
  a square meter of land is 500-1000 eur , in a country with a 475 eur per month average income . 
  [ cluj-napoca , romania ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@46.762109,23.6028419,3a,75y,120.47h,89.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skpt5t-usrgo4_wo0mvqb7g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro ), 
  they rarely smile in public [ except when posing in front of some landmark ] they look guarded and humble , even when in larger numbers they scowl in disgust at gypsies , and immediately leave the area if one shows up , conditionaly responding by holding one hand on their pocket where they have their phone , and the other one on the wallet or handbag , until they are `` out of range '' if they have to pay for something , they only speak about money in romanian , and trough whispers they always seem to have very expensive photographic equipment , almost never using tiny cameras , camcorders or cellphones to take pictures , in a group of 5 there will be at least 3 dslrs they never !, 
  ever !, 
  give money to beggars they shop in supermarkets while traveling to compare local prices with those at home . 
  what ??? 
  this is insane !, 
  the government that has cameras everywhere , does n't check ids for voting ? 
  what 's to stop those 12 million immigrants from just walking in on `` the trust system '' i ca n't believe i never knew about this . 
  that 's like saying your nuclear launch program , is just a windows 95 pc , siting there , connected to the internet !, 
  the london property market is being used by organized crime and corrupt embezzling officials from all over the world , as a bond market . 
  they basically buy multi-million properties trough non discloser offshore firms , that unlike property , can be sold in secret . 
  therefore turning the property deed enveloped in the offshore , in to a bearer bond equivalent . 
   a source would be nice . 
  http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/609492/40-romanian-immigrant-slaves-police-crammed-tiny-house-crime-gang just one of many many cases . 
   that 's illegal ... like i said in may first comment , legally they get payed 7.20 x 160 hours , despite working 12-16 hours 7 days a week , they have 1152 transfered to their account , and then they are forced to pay for their rent , food , equipment , etc. 
  a company goon takes their ids and bank cards and takes money back from all of them until they are left with about 550-750 depending on workload . 
   why do so many come here ? 
  they do n't `` come '' they get swindled by british recruiting agencies , with promises of 1300 pounds per month and a shared room for free . 
  instead they get 750 and a bunk in a room with 15 others in a leaky mold infested box in a field , with a portapotty for 50 people , and before they can complain about it an leave , they have their documents locked away in a safe , and are being threatened with violence and told they ca n't leave without paying 2000 pounds for the minivan trip that brought them there . 
  by that logic , those attacks in paris last year , were carried out by a bunch of belgians . 
  well that figures , seeing as how most of their agricultural industry is basically an eastern european kibbutz . 
  migrants who come in every season in such impressive numbers , the low cost airlines have to supplement flights during those peak months twice a year . 
  those people work for as little as 750 pounds a month , doing labor intensive work for 12 to 16 hours a day sometimes , they sleep in on site caravans , 8 to a box , eat whatever they are given , because to them , 750 pounds is 1000 eur and that 's what they , as simple peasants , expect to make as immigrant workers . 
  officially they get payed the minimum wage for a 40h/week , but the employer is also the landlord in these cases , and they have to be driven in minivans or buses escorted by `` security '' to atms in town to cash money from their accounts and give it back to the employer for `` room and board '' . 
  they could also be forced to give up their bank cards and pin numbers to a `` trustee '' who does it all for them . 
  they wont hire anyone on these plantations , without him also being a `` resident '' . 
  they even confiscate all forms of legal identification from the `` laborers '' in order to prevent them from running away . 
  in spain or italy they 'd make about as much , after the added expenses of having to pay for rent , transportation and food themselves . 
  i really do n't see the uk agricultural industry surviving outside the freedom of movement zone , because , you see ... 
  the british farmers do n't farm the land , they farm the eastern europeans .
