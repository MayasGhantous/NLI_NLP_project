thanks for write-up , interesting to see that us your neightbors a little bit to the east ( i 'm romanian ) work exactly like hungary does , i.e. 
  two main interest groups fighting against each other for access to money and resources like two mafia gangs would fight . 
  25 years after the `` fall '' of communism we also have people from the old regime ( and their kids ) who still control almost everything . 
  we actually did !, 
  although in our case ( romania ) it was called [ `` the spark '' ( * scanteia * ) ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=scanteia&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=fsr&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=mabyvjvzczfhavg7gqam&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613 ), 
  fucking toilet paper was hard to get by , for crying out loud , when i first read in orwell 's * 1984 * ( some time after the wall had fallen ) about how razer blades were very hard to find in that fictional world of his i thought `` this guy must have lived under communism rule '' . 
  amateurs , they only formed one queue , the correct way is to have at least two parallel queues ( or even a third one ) , like [ this one ] ( https://ioanianolide.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/coada-la-alimente-comunism.jpg ) or [ this one ] ( http://riscograma.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/coada-la-paine.jpg ) . 
  source : i grew up in romania in the '80s . 
  also , how the worst queues always happened in november of february or a cold month like that and there was always that neon light which meant that you 've made it , you were so far advanced in the queue that you actually made it into the store and not left outside in the cold . 
  the smell of cabbage or potatoes which you could actually see close to you , meaning that you were indeed going to buy them and not go home empty-handed . 
  man , as a romanian kid who grew up in the '80s close to the border with bulgaria i 'm surprised that you guys had bigger antennas in order to watch serbian tv , we here in romania were all tuning in to watch bulgarsky televisie  to this day i get super-nostalgia when re-watching the [ leka nosht detsa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yib8oc7xe9u ) tv cartoons opening , i also remember how my parents were regularly visiting their best friends ( who had a color-screen tv ) on saturday evenings to watch the studiox movie programme on bulgarian television , while us kids were being left in the other room to play . 
  i also remember the oranges thing , to this day i 'm a little bit surprised that we have oranges in super-markets all year long . 
  as for the queue thing , i once remember how my mother came back home from work in the middle of the work-day and took 7-year old me to the neighborhood 's food-store , only that instead of going through the front-entrance where the big queue was we went directly to the back-door , from where my mother bought some edible oil and sugar ( i think ) , presumably because she had been tipped to do so by some of her friends . 
  it was a hot summer day and i was wearing a white hat . 
  i miss that day . 
  public transport was also a bitch . 
  buses generally sucked , you had to make your way through into the bus using everything you had at your disposal : elbows , bags , umbrellas . 
  one of the many reasons why i was looking at my dad as a hero was that he seemed to always manage to make his way through a huge and nasty bus queue . 
  i loved trains , though , even though they were just as full , at least they were n't giving me motion sickness and they were cool and loud in a good way ( i still love trains ) . 
  video cassette recorders were worth almost their weight in gold back then . 
  when we went to the seaside sometime in the '80s my parents visited one of the my mother 's uncles , who was a sailor and who had such a marvel in his home . 
  i recall 6-7 persons watching a badly dubbed us action film , but it seemed like science fiction to me . 
  i also remember when i first saw a video of michael jackson and him being assaulted by fans somewhere around 1986-87 , at a night vcr screening at some of my parents ' intellectual friends . 
  it seemed like out of this world , it pretty much was , for us behind the iron wall . 
  well , one of the best economics books that i 've read was written by a french , [ jean-baptiste say ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-baptiste_say ) . 
  there 's a good reason why `` entrepreneur '' and `` laissez-faire '' are french words . 
  i 'm romanian and i watched this film with my ex-wife and ex-mother-in-law . 
  the film ends , the three of us go out for a coffee to discuss a little bit more about what we had just seen , and then my ex-mother-in-law starts telling us about all the illegal abortions she had to do in the '80s , the nastier of them all being the one where she had to go back by train to her provincial city 300km outside of bucharest , just hours after it had happened , with only a piece of cottonwool between her legs which turned into red by the time the train arrived . 
  there was also the part where long after the communist regime had felt i found a old police paper hidden in my mother 's things where they were informing my mother ( the police did ) that she was no longer a suspect for going through an illegal abortion . 
  things were really , really fucked up . 
  wait , you do n't have divorce in cyprus ? 
  i was reading though ( that was a couple of years ago ) that there 's a thing with young israeli couples that want to get married doing that in cyprus , for some reasons related to marriage still being a religious-only thingie in israel . 
   norwegian agricultural policy makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to import dairy products other than cheese . 
  that 's crazy . 
  i always , i mean always , have imported butter in my fridge ( most of the time is german-made ) , if somehow they 'll ban its being imported i 'd probably go out and protest in the streets . 
  the commercially produced romanian butter just does n't seem to have that extra thing ( which , btw , my grandma 's home-made butter had ) . 
  come to think of it she still makes great butter ( she 's using [ this thing ] ( http://www.mncr.ro/images/product_images/109_mncr3244.jpg ) called a * putinei * ) , i should pay her a visit . 
  and now i feel guilty for not seeing her for more than a year ... 
  not sure if you know about him , but [ florin curta 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florin_curta ) works , especially his [ the making of the slavs : history and archaeology of the lower danube region , c. 500-700 ] ( http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/european-history-450-1000/making-slavs-history-and-archaeology-lower-danube-region-c500700?format=pb ) , says pretty much the same thing , i.e. 
  that the slavic migration is mostly a myth not corroborated by any serious archaeological findings . 
  he 's still one of the few guys/ladies holding this line among historians , but i hope more people will start looking at the actual findings ( like curta did ) and not jump to romantic-era conclusions . 
   on the way back we get a taxi , it costs 6 lei . 
  she gives him 10 lei and he goes `` i do n't have change '' do n't what to sound rude or anything , but taxis are dirt cheap in bucharest , they 're cheaper than any other city/town in romania and they 're definitely cheaper than any other european capital . 
  because of that the taxi drivers rely on tips to actually bring some money home . 
  my rule of thumb when taking a taxi in bucharest is never pay less than 10 lei , no matter the distance ( 10 lei equals ~ 2.2 euro , meaning dirt cheap ) , and for anything greater than that i usually add a 15 % -20 % tip . 
  25 + years since 1989 and we 're still called * ex-communist central european states * . 
  maybe we should start calling austria as * the former hapsburg state * or germany as * the former holy roman empire * ( yeah , i know these do n't overlap and it 's a very broad historic generalization , but you get the point ) . 
  not sure if it was thatcher or churchill who said it , but i 'm starting to realize why having a united and bully-er germany right in the middle of the continent was not the best possible outcome for the other smaller european countries . 
   germanys ~ 20 billion euro contribution to the eu should go to countries who do n't cooperate in the refugee crisis ? 
  this is blackmail , pure and simple , and you know it . 
  this does n't bode well for the future of the union . 
  an article from [ 2010 ] ( https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/international-trade-and-development-1-57/general-analysis-on-international-trade-and-development/48887.html ) , written from an african perspective , and a [ guardian article from 2011 ] ( https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/international-trade-and-development-1-57/general-analysis-on-international-trade-and-development/48887.html ) . 
  in another comment i linked to a financial times article decrying eu sugar subsidies which was from 2011 . 
  it 's not only about subsidizing sugar , it 's the whole package : dairy products , grains etc. 
  from the first article :  it 's worth saying again : every cow in the west receives $ 2.5 a day in subsidies , compared to 90 cents a day for every child in the developing world . 
  a quick introduction [ on the issue ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/stop_the_dumping_how_eu_agricultural_subsidies.htm ) . 
  the whole european agricultural subsidies thing is a farce , almost everyone in brussels agrees on that , but as european farmers have political power then we just pretend that there 's nothing in there . 
   we got next to no relations with africa first thing that i quickly [ found on google ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/387c030c-57a9-11df-855b-00144feab49a.html#axzz3kmdkqqvd ) :  sugar companies were the biggest beneficiaries of the european union 's $ 55bn ( $ 71.24 bn ) in agriculture subsidies last year , a new study has found . 
  do n't know what your opinion is on this , but i personally think that it will be much more economically sound to grow sugar-supporting plants ( do n't know the exact english term , but you get the idea ) in tropical and warmer places like africa , instead of doing it in europe . 
  that is , if there were no subsidies in place . 
  and there are other countless examples . 
  another [ link ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/stop_the_dumping_how_eu_agricultural_subsidies.htm ) :  europe 's agricultural subsidies are inflicting enormous damage on producers in developing countries . 
  the practice of dumping -- exporting at prices far below the costs of production -- is destroying domestic markets in poor countries . 
  this paper shows the impact of dumping eu sugar and dairy products on the livelihoods of farmers in mozambique , india , and jamaica . 
  ( ... ) oxfam is calling on the eu to use the mid-term review of the cap to agree a plan which will stop the dumping of eu agricultural produce on world markets . 
   africa can have 4b but can it feed them ? 
  no , not really , as long as western european countries keep most of their agricultural protectionist policies in place , which makes it un-economical for almost anyone to invest in extensive agriculture in places like africa . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  plus , that 's all this `` let 's keep the jungle and animals in place '' , which is a very worthy goal ( i 'm all for it ) , but which adds an extra burden on the african countries . 
  or [ romanian supermarkets , for hammer drills ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buu47d8jh7k ), 
  that 's what some romanian tourists would have done , also . 
  athletics needs a thorough cleanup , like cycling started doing after the festina scandal . 
  there are a couple of `` rough diamonds '' out there ( guys like usain bolt ) who i 'm sure are winning it based on their merits alone , but dafne schippers 's 200m time reminded me of katrin krabbe and the infamous ddr athletes . 
  to say nothing of the fact that the last woman who ran that fast , [ marion jones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marion_jones ) , proved out to have been drug-enhanced through the nose . 
  maybe living on a couple of rocks in the middle of the cold north atlantic ocean was not the best thing to begin with , long-term survival-wise ( see what happened to the [ norse settlement in greenland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenland#norse_settlement ) ) , and i also i find it a little bit anachronistic for an entire population to depend on the hunting of large mammals , in the 21st century . 
  i 'm the guy who thinks that whales are not the same thing as fish and apparently that 's something to be made fun of . 
  well , you live and learn . 
   they hunt whales to feed their families rather than `` scientific research '' or sport . 
  i 'm sure the faroese are very nice persons and all , but for us people who believe that creatures like whales or dolphins are [ non-human persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personhood#non-human_animals ) it 's very painful to read that . 
  it 's like swift 's `` a modest proposal '' brought to life . 
   pay more means that wages are going to go up . 
  where 's that money going to come from ? 
  ( for wages to go up , i mean ) . 
  i 'm talking about a real increase of wages , which can only be sustained by increased productivity ( and this proposed plan is not pro-productivity at all ) , not by inflationary central bank politics . 
   the internet is a cia project i know i 'm paranoid and that it 's pure speculation , but [ george tenet 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_tenet ) present company , [ allen & company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allen_%26_company ) , was facebook 's adviser on its $ 19 billion purchase of whatsapp . 
  now , put yourself in putin 's shoes . 
  you see a recently `` retired '' cia director whose firm advises one of the biggest internet companies in the world ( number of users : ~ 1 billion ) on the ( apparently ) over-valued purchase of another internet company ( number of users : ~ 600 million ) . 
  would n't this situation ring any bells ? 
  as a recent driver my solution is not to have that beer for lunch if i think i might drive later in the day . 
  no harm done . 
   about 8 months ago . 
  that 's what i was thinking , too . 
  i 'm relatively new on this sub , i first commented in here i think about 1 year ago , and compared to the shit-hole that 's / r/worldnews it seemed like a breath of fresh air . 
  and then something changed , for the worst . 
  what 's even sadder is that country-specific sub-reddits seem to change into anti-immigrant , xenophobic shit-holes too ( i 'm talking about / r/romania , specifically ) . 
  he 's funny , though  i mean , not as funny as mr bean , but close enough . 
  well , imho nothing beats [ eforie nord ] ( http://www.pozeleonline.ro/o_anunturi/5722.jpg ) , on the romanian side of the coast . 
  i 'm with you on this one . 
  numbers do make a huge difference . 
  we ( meaning us , romanians ) also have this sz\u00e9kely guy who likes to burn romanian flags whenever he likes .
