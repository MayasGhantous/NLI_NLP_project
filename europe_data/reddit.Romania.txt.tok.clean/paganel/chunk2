  i ( and most of the people i know ) do n't mind it , because i realize that that flag is only a piece of cloth/fabric ( whatever the english word is ) , plus i know that that guy is mostly alone in his endeavors . 
  but were i to hear 90,000 hungarian people say `` death to romanians !, 
  '' , all in one voice , things will be totally different . 
   for example people are buying expensive cars ( worth more than their apartment ) i see that us , former communist countries , still do share lots of stuff post 1990 . 
   get millions of dollars in 1988 from his dad in the party so i see that everything was the same in eastern europe after the fall of communism . 
  never been to germany so i may be totally in the wrong here , but my understanding is that a thorough denazification process never took place in germany immediately after ww2 , going into the '60s and even the '70s , when biology started playing its role and the old nazis started dying : think judges , train-station chiefs , police commissioners , lawyers , industrialists etc. 
  so in a way these `` you 're a nazi '' accusations have a reason behind them , i.e. 
  a lot of former nazis were still active and doing well after 1945 . 
  no , not really . 
  bulgarian compots are the best compots !, 
  also , the rose petal jam that you guys make is also the best . 
  i bought mine ~ 5 years ago , and they stood up pretty well , i still wear two of them on a regular basis ( the 3rd one i only wear when at home ) . 
  sad if they changed for the worst . 
  and why is that ? 
  i loved it when i first entered the primark store on oxford street and could find really nice t-shirts for 5 pounds . 
  compare that to zara , where the quality/design has gone downhill and the prices have gone up . 
  mango men , is nice , though . 
  indeed , they do n't . 
  my ex-wife was on a ferry from kos to santorini last week or so , and she told me that it was full of immigrants . 
  i understand that football is not that popular in canada , so that football matches never have more than 20-30 people in the stands , but here in europe is quite popular , attracting tens of thousands on a regular basis . 
  i live just 4-5 tram stations away from a stadium where it 's not unusual to have 40-50 thousand people in the stands . 
  when i first attended such a match i said to myself : `` wow , that 's a lot of people ! '' . 
  when seeing this video i said `` wow , there 's a lot of people ! '', 
  in my mind for at least 2 or 3 times , hence my estimate . 
  wow !, 
  there 's at least 100-150 thousand people in there , from what i could see . 
  source : me going to football matches . 
   drafts make you sick . 
  the same goes for romania . 
  ot question : are you from omurtag , the bulgarian town ? 
  just curious , i somehow like that town because it reminds me that i 'm about to cross the balkans into trakia and then turkey is just two steps away . 
  also , the road through the mountains to kotel ( if i 'm not mistaken ) is damn beautiful . 
   these men are willing to prepare for the worst , they are willing to go and defend their culture and fellow countrymen in case it happens , `` omg , these men are terrible and stupid '' . 
  yes , war is indeed stupid , is one of the stupidest things i know , it 's one of the stupidest things we do , as an animal species . 
  but maybe me being a lurker on / r/syriancivilwar for the past year or so has made me a `` pussy '' , who would not give his life neither for his `` countrymen '' nor for his `` culture '' . 
  this post feels so much like july-august 1914 . 
  and then the battle of the somme happened . 
  i have to say these pro-militaristic comments have surprised me a little . 
  i could n't stop comparing these estonian dudes ' happy faces with the ones of those serving and mostly dying in the syrian arab army . 
  it 's all fun and dandy until you 're suddenly missing an arm as a result of shrapnel , or your brains are filmed on yt as a result of sniper fire . 
  ditto for romania . 
  there 's lots of syrians who are among the `` boat people '' who try to reach italy . 
  those people are fleeing from a devastating civil war . 
  did you happen to already know german before moving to austria ? 
  if not , was it difficult for you to integrate ? 
  because the english language is the reason why a lot of people move to the uk ( and ireland ) instead of somewhere else on the continent . 
  for example a colleague of mine moved to frankfurt and she has all sorts of issues with the german language , as in she has started to learn it but does n't like it one bit . 
  what 's wrong with turkey ? 
  i mean , apart from erdogan , which i try my best to ignore , the country itself is very beautiful , the people are generally nice ( at least they seemed nice to me when i visited ) and the food ... the food is gorgeous . 
   it popularized french hip hop and led to tv shows and films like engrenages , wrong side of the tracks and girlhood . 
  for what it 's worth we have one very nice french bookstore in our east european capital ( small place , pretty cosy ) and just the other day as i was looking for a couple of books i heard iam 's [ `` l'empire du c\u00f4t\u00e9 obscur '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcjwxitb_p4 ) from the radio station which one can always hear when entering said bookstore ( which usually plays the `` classic '' hipsterish french music ) . 
  granted , it was somehow a toned-down version , more like a cover , but the words were the same . 
  so what i 'm trying to say is that banlieue music has at least entered the cultural french mainstream . 
   after 2 days of protests ( significant ones ) the pm would resign . 
  you wo n't see 2 days of significant protests , nobody is in the mood for that , the holidays are coming . 
  as a balkanized , gipsyfied romanian who lives in the [ old kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_old_kingdom ) and who has just returned from a trip to brasov i have to say that [ today is definitely a good day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cplf-iekxq ), 
  because i live in eastern europe , visited western europe , and wanted to share what i saw . 
  if it 's `` obvious bullshit '' to some , so be it . 
  i 've been to london and paris and did n't see any stunning woman who might have been a local . 
  but were i to take a three-hour drive from bucharest to the border with moldova or ukraine and stop in a random small town from there i can guarantee you that i 'd see very beautiful women . 
  are you from eastern europe ? 
  because you just described how most of us lived in the '90s , without having `` deserved '' it either . 
   does eu structural funds affect economy of polish neighbours ? 
  not polish , but my dad works a sub-sub-contractor for a romanian company building a sewerage network in a smallish romanian city . 
  the project is worth a total of 90 million euros , with about 80 million coming from the eu . 
  now , the interesting part is that the main contractor , the company which actually won the project and which , presumably , is receiving the biggest cut , is a spanish company . 
  it 's been almost a year since my dad and his workers have been digging ditches and such , and in this time he never saw any spaniard guy on the field . 
  so , i guess that 's a nice way of helping the spanish economy . 
  they definitely still exist in romania . 
  saw one at 10pm on the big european road that connects bucharest to ploiesti , that was interesting . 
  also saw more than a few when i drove north of pitesti up to curtea de arges , just last weekend . 
  you can get a pretty nice one one-bedroom apartment for like 270-300 euros in pretty nice areas of bucharest , and you can definitely get a studio for 250 euros . 
  and on top of that you do n't want to live in downtown bucharest , that 's where all of the 1930s-1940s buildings are , nobody expects them to still stand after the next big earthquake . 
  one of my dreams is just to drive for 2 weeks through central united states , in places like kansas , iowa , north dakota , over the mississippi river etc. 
  i know there 's mostly corn fields and stuff like that in there , i do n't care . 
  plus , i also want to watch a ny mets game sometime , but that would mean i 'd have to stay in new york for at least a couple of nights and adding the match tickets it could get expensive really fast . 
  and i do n't really like the fact that in order to enter the us i have to ask for a visa , to go through an interview and all that . 
  interviews and asking for permission make me nervous . 
  auchan is where the real deal is , though . 
  ca n't really understand how come they always have the lowest prices and among the best selection of products , but it 's damn nice . 
  i certainly understood though why its owner is a billionaire , he deserves to be . 
   this is georgy zhukov , the guy who turned the war around and led the soviet victory against the nazis yeah , when i saw `` a soviet commander '' in the title i thought that maybe they interviewed a now 90-years old former soviet general or something , not that they were talking about georgy zhukov , whose influence on ww2 was f.cking huge . 
  it 's like calling patton `` a former us general '' or rommel a `` wehrmacht high-ranking officer who fought in northern africa '' . 
  and back to zhukov 's influence , a lot of us people who now live in eastern europe would n't be here at this moment if it had n't been for guys like him . 
  i certainly know what the soviet army and 50 years of communism meant for countries liberated by the soviet union , but compare that with the total physical annihilation of poland and of the polish people hitler would have carried out and other crazy things that would have happened ( also involving tens of millions of civilians being annihilated ) , and maybe then we can start seeing things in a better light . 
  i know putin is a crazy as hell guy , but maybe on this may 9th the rest of us , europeans , can leave all the current bad feelings behind us and realize that if it had n't been for the soviets europe would have been in a much , much worst state of affairs . 
   it seems like people believe the public sector to be structurally inefficient and `` corrupt '' without having any explanations as to why this should be because people are by definition corrupt if you do not apply some checks to them . 
  for normal people like me and you those checks are usually called laws , while in a genuine capitalist system the checks are called `` you go out of business if you do n't make your company more competitive/better '' . 
  the problem with state-run enterprises is that there 's no-one there to punish them , they can not be kept in check by the market and neither by laws ( because it 's the same state that makes the laws ) . 
  source : grew up in a 100 % nationalized country . 
  things were orders of magnitude better on the other side , the one run by capitalists . 
  or start breeding dogs to better protect your sheep . 
  in my country we have these [ lovely beasts ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=ciobanesc+mioritic&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=se1&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=fba2vfnsessssagpqydicq&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613 ) , which i 'm pretty sure that can handle wolves just fine . 
  i know the whole discussion about `` bad colonialism '' vs. good colonialism , but in my country 's case , romania , the russian defeat of the ottomans and the subsequent [ 1829 treaty of adrianople ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_adrianople_%281829%29 ) was the beginning of modernity for us . 
  first of all , it meant that we were finally allowed to sell our stuff to other states than the ottoman empire , which meant that economically speaking we were not slaves anymore . 
  and second , the first modern constitution of the romanian principalities , dating from 1830 , was the work of a brilliant russian general , [ pavel kiseleff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_kiselyov#administration_of_the_danubian_principalities ) . 
  to this day one of the main boulevards in bucharest ( and definitely the most prestigious in terms of real-estate value ) bears his name . 
  it 's not the sandals , it 's the sandals with socks that does it , 
  after a quick glance at the article i think it 's targeted at american baby-boomers who have too much money on their hand and want to spend it somewhere , anywhere , and look fancy in front of their friends when they come back home . 
  we 've all seen them at one time or another .
