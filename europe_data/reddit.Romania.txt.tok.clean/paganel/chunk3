  my favorite such meetup was when i was boarding a ferry from paros , in greece , a couple of summers ago . 
  all the european tourists were dressed as you would expect one to be dressed on a greek island while desperate to catch a higher place in the waiting queue , while the two couples of us tourists in their 60s that were sitting just close to me were wearing designer handbags and $ 700 + sunglasses . 
  it 's 60 km from bucharest to the border with bulgaria , another 60-80km to a bulgarian county where one can find muslim villages ( like the [ razgrad province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/razgrad_province ) ) . 
  i do n't find it that far , to be honest . 
   do n't they have some turks in bulgaria ? 
  they do . 
  i live in bucharest and i 'm only one-and-a-half / 2-hour drive from the nearest bulgarian village with a minaret in the middle of it . 
  i for one find it quite nice and interesting . 
  it has nothing to do with any `` separatist '' romanian citizens , this is n't [ march 1990 anymore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t%c3%a2rgu_mure%c8%99 ) . 
  it 's all related to ukraine and everyone and his dog ( rightfully ) thinking that the conflict will start again once the weather will get warmer . 
  +1 for purcari wines , they 're great . 
  it will be interesting to see which plants they 'll close in europe . 
  because they will close some plants . 
  thank you for the [ sarmale ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=sarmale&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=qq7&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=iviwvycdfpb5aqypgzgj&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613 ) , also . 
  i 'm a romanian and i know that i 'm ( obviously ) only speaking for myself , but truth be told i do n't see anyone attacking me or my country right at this moment . 
  and even if they did , i would certainly not kill any of those attackers , i have other major issues to take care in my life , like making sure that i have enough money to pay the rent , to bay the bills and to financially help my parents who still live in the countryside . 
  plus , killing people is wrong . 
   the socialist high-rise apartment blocks famous in eastern europe were invented and pioneered by the swiss french in the 1950s and 1960 so that 's why the apartment blocks in lausanne looked so similar ( in theory ) to some of the 1960s blocks from bucharest . 
  think [ this ] ( https://maps.google.ro/maps?q=lausanne,+switzerland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=46.530436,6.611495&amp;spn=0.012474,0.033023&amp;sll=44.437826,26.094638&amp;sspn=0.414279,1.056747&amp;oq=lausan&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=lausanne,+vaud,+switzerland&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=46.531116,6.607291&amp;panoid=p9gcyoa9jyloyzhdko_yqa&amp;cbp=12,154.45,,0,-7.88 ) , in lausanne , vs [ this ] ( https://maps.google.ro/maps?q=strada+glinka+mihail,+bucharest&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=44.463574,26.102325&amp;spn=0.00647,0.016512&amp;sll=44.462617,26.104696&amp;sspn=0.00647,0.020599&amp;oq=strada+glinka+bucharest&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=strada+glinka+mihail,+bucure%c8%99ti,+municipiul+bucure%c8%99ti&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.463563,26.102452&amp;panoid=eiuqxtzhnhlmtayu_zjqlw&amp;cbp=12,76.76,,0,-4.68 ) , in bucharest . 
  the day when the last [ tatra t4 ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=tatra+t4+trams&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=896&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=24abvf2dm4xvuv65gvgc&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq#tbm=isch&amp;q=tatra+t4 ) will make its rides in my city will be a very , very sad day for me . 
  those things look just like a tram should look . 
  i just love trams !, 
  after 1945 the saying was `` scratch a romanian communist 's neck and you 'll find a green shirt in there '' . 
  meaning a lot of former [ iron guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_guard ) members had no issues with joining the communists ' ranks once things had changed . 
  ** edit : ** and i just remembered a story about the [ jilava_massacre ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jilava_massacre ) , in which iron guard ( i.e. 
  fascist ) members killed a lot of former politicians and romanian personalities while they were detained in the jilava prison . 
  it is said that during the massacre the communist detainees who were held in the same prison started banging their personal stuff ( spoons etc ) over the cells ' iron bars in order to create so much noise that the victims ' screams would not be heard by the guards . 
  it may be apocryphal , but i 've heard this story from my father whose father ( my grand-father ) was a communist by conviction starting with the 1950s . 
  yeah , but gipsies live there , and we do n't care about gipsies . 
   but we 've got this `` romania : christian , ** latin ** and unitary '' ideological movemen you mean our glorious dacian ancestors , did n't you ? 
  everyone knows that [ trajan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trajan ) was a gay mother-fucker who raped our darling [ dochia ] ( http://www.gorj-domino.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/poza-12.jpg ) , there 's no way us glorious romanian people could descend from those bastards . 
  as one of your neighbors from the north who has passed through your country by car several times ( to greece , turkey , your black sea coast ) , i can confirm that the bulgarian countryside is a ghost country , at least compared to what i 'm used to see here in romania when i go outside the big cities ( not that we 're doing any better fertility - and emmigration-wise ) . 
   i know there 's a tendency to portray the ussr as backward compared to the west , but they really had some interesting science . 
  i grew on the eastern side of the iron curtain in the '80s , and i 'll give you my non-professional but consumer-based ( i.e. 
  mine ) sort-of-related opinion : the west was always managing to build and sell to market things that were smaller , more nice and better functioning then their eastern-europe counterparts . 
  putting two products with similar functionality side-by-side ( a tv set , a vhs player , a photo-camera , jeans , tv shows ) , one produced in the west and the other one produced in the east , you could tell from a mile away which one was the western ( meaning better ) product . 
  i mean yeah , it was nice that our side was able to send people into cosmos , but us , the regular people in eastern europe , were always striving for the other side 's better products . 
   what do you think will happen wenn greek pensioneers can not get access to their pensions anymore because the banks ca n't pay him out ? 
  create new banks , that 's how capitalism is supposed to work , by definition : if a thing does n't work , let it fail , so that something better can take its place . 
  i agree thought that in practice we do not live in a capitalistic world , but in a strange place between socialism and capitalism that benefits no-one apart from a select few . 
  today i 've learned that the home of christianity is not jesus christ 's alleged birthplace and the place where he lived , but a place in italy which holds the headquarters of one of christianity 's sub-sects . 
  serious question : do you find the visigoths as being western european enough ? 
  i suppose you do , i mean , they 're `` early goths '' , that 's nothing more western european than that , according to some people . 
  the best thing is that they were christian arians , named after a guy called [ arius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arius ) , * of libyan birth , possibly of berber extraction , and priest in alexandria , egypt , of the church of the baucalis * , meaning , well , he 's not from rome and not european . 
  [ theoderic the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theoderic_the_great ) was also an arian , you might have heard of him , he was the ruler of the ostrogoths when they were dominating present-day northern italy . 
  i 'm not a believer anymore , but whenever you mention `` western civilization '' you have to mention christianity , which is a middle-eastern monotheistic religion by definition . 
  jesus christ , virgin mary and all the apostles were middle eastern people ( it does n't matter if they really existed or not , what matters is that their `` story '' is set in the middle east ) . 
  reminds me of the videos one can regularly see on / r/syriancivilwar or / r/combatfootage about the isis suicide armored trucks which relentlessly do damage to their adversaries . 
  you see the first go off in the distance and you think to yourself `` this must be it , it 's done enough damage '' , then you see a second one , and a third one . 
  there have been reports of 5 or 6 such suicide attacks happening in a very short period of time to some iraqi or saa fortified positions . 
  the psychological effects in themselves must be devastating . 
   is it really ? 
  it certainly affected my 85-year old grand-mother and my brother , who live in the carpathian mountains ( my brother lives with my grandma ) . 
  my brother tried to sell a cow last summer which he had raised/fed for about 4 years , and he expected a market price of about 450 euros . 
  now , because of the embargo the market is flooded with cheap meat ( pig , beef , you name it ) , so he had to settle for a price of only ~ 180 euros , that 's almost a 60 % price reduction . 
  he was saying to me that that most probably does n't even cover the price of laboring to make the hay and all that . 
  apart from the non-stop raining and bleak weather , yeah , it is . 
  or at least that 's a friend of mine told me after she had moved to frankfurt last summer . 
  as a rule of thumb : do n't give these people any money . 
  that 's what we do , at least . 
  it was n't always like this , just after the communists fell and beggars started invading the streets some of us were feeling guilty and started feeding them money . 
  it took us 10 or so years to learn that this was only making it worse . 
  maybe one day you 'll learn , too . 
  i guess that was one of the main reasons why i loved rome when i visited last autumn . 
  i do n't care if that makes me a former-soviet bloc nostalgic or anything , but i much prefer the `` i do n't care about you '' look to the `` all smiles and giggles '' look , which most of the time is a fake thing anyway ( and if it 's not fake , it makes me think the people who are doing this are a little psychopathic , why would one smile so much without any real reason ? ), 
  also the tiramisu i 've eaten in one of rome 's restaurants was one the best cakes i 've eaten anywhere , anytime . 
  that thing was magic . 
  damn , i miss rome !, 
  you can also add the moldavians . 
  i 'm no wine-expert or anything , but i really like the [ purcari ] ( http://purcari.md/en/home/ ) wine . 
  latakia and tartous on the mediterranean cost are also safe , as far as being safe in syria means , but i have n't heard that being mentioned in any discussion about the syrian refugees . 
  and for a good reason : because the argument with `` a part of the country is safe ! '', 
  is bogus . 
  as far as poland standing between ukraine and germany the same thing applies to greece . 
  why , indeed , do n't all the immigrants want to remain on the greek islands ? 
  they must be foolish . 
  on a more serious note , is really sad seeing how the european project is unraveling under our own very eyes . 
  the germans ( as were the austrians or the dutch ) were very quick to profit from the eu enlargement ( i can give you my country 's example , where the banking and oil industries are controlled by the austrians , germans control the retail market etc etc ) , but when the tough times arrived they all started to appoint blame and feel morally superior . 
  i 've said it before on this sub-reddit , i 'll say it again : maybe allowing east and west germany to unite and form one big blob in the middle of continent was n't the best idea post 1990 . 
  at that time it seemed ok , the french still had mitterand , the british had thatcher , but now , with the british almost gone and with the french giving us that pathetic hollande , the rest of us , europeans , have to handle merkel and her electorate . 
  it 's not pretty . 
   niaks used to refer to serbs as vlachs . 
    as an insult , yes . 
   when they 're sacrificing pigs nothing wrong with that !, 
  i mean , once you 've tested [ \u0219orici ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=sorici&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiolkxhj4hlahvjfiwkhv3mcuoqsaqiha&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=897 ) you can excuse all past , present and future harms done to any pigs as long as they continue to generate this divine food . 
  provided they 're dead , of course . 
  yeah , it certainly helps if you live in the south  i live in bucharest , so for the trip to aegina we left the city at 6 in the morning and reached thessaloniki around 4-5 pm , if i 'm not mistaken ( with lots of bathroom breaks ) . 
  the following morning we left thessaloniki at around 8 or 9 in the morning and reached the port in piraeus around 4 or 5 in the afternoon , you 're mostly driving on a highway . 
  a trip to thassos only takes one day , though , including the short ferry trip . 
  there are a lot more romanians who prefer driving to greece than taking the plane . 
  places like chalkidiki , platamonas or lefkada are full with romanians come summer , while thassos is basically a romanian colony all summer long . 
  all of these people go there by car . 
  as for myself , i have indeed flown by airplane 3 times while vacationing in greece , but only because i had to reach paros , in the cyclades , and it would have taken us a lot more time and money to get there by car compared to airplane + ferry . 
  but i 've also been vacationing in aegina island , just outside piraeus , after getting there by car . 
  in both cases i had a over-night stay in thessaloniki , which is a wonderful city . 
  greece itself is a wonderful country . 
  i miss greece . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  this is going to be a shit-storm , people over in / r/syriancivilwar are going ballistic over this , and for good reason . 
  meanwhile over on bbc news ' front-page there 's only a mention of russians doing something nasty to syrian civilians ( and something about kanye west 's tweets and what a psychologist thinks about them ?!? ),
