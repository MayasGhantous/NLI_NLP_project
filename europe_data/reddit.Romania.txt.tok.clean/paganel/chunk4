  while the ny times is only interested in what 's the latest stupid thing trump said . 
  i genuinely and sincerely hope that this will somehow , miraculously , calm down . 
  not to mention what will mean for europe if turkey and russia get involved in a war on opposing sides , i also have my brother who is a truck driver and who drives to turkey every 2-3 weeks ( to bursa , more specifically ) and one of my best friends , who works for airbus defence ( former eads ) on the saudi - iraq border , securing the saudi border . 
  yeah , it is true . 
  after the communists fell most of the countryside people received back their parents ' and grand-parents ' lands that had been confiscated by the communists in the 1950s . 
  that generated a lot of fights , both within and between families , centered on arguments like `` this is my land !!, 
  it does n't belong to you !! '' . 
  some of those fights ended up in people getting killed . 
  that sounds like a cool trip you guys had . 
  did you really drove all the way to mongolia with a nissan micra ? 
  if yes , then ... wow !, 
  i also need to reconsider my future vacation plans , that trip with my hatchback to the caucasus ( georgia , armenia ) sure looks interesting . 
  thx for the reply !, 
  reply to the ps : yeap , it is indeed from [ children of the captain grant ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088635/fullcredits#cast )  i used to watch it as a kid before the wall fell , in the cold winter of '86 or ' 87 . 
  at that time romanian national television was only broadcasting 3 hours per evening , from 7 pm to 10 pm ( they would later reduce the broadcast to 2 hours ) , and this movie was one of the only cool things to be shown on tv at that time . 
  plus , it was based on a jules verne , you can not not like a jules verne story , 
  so you 're saying that if one were to learn russian then it would be pretty straightforward to learn bulgarian , too ? 
  i 'm asking because i 've really wanted to learn russian for a long time now ( at least i know how to read cyrillic ) , and was curious if that would also make me easier to understand what our neighbors from the south are saying . 
  it 's been known outside of italy ever since bierhoff played and scored a lot of goals for them in the mid ' -90 s , and more recently because of players like alexis sanchez and handanovici . 
  i 'd say outside of italy they are at fiorentina 's level of fan awareness , behind the big three ( juve , milan , inter ) and the roma teams , but slightly above more historic teams like torino or genoa . 
  that 's what i could never understand about kosovo . 
   the red eggs , that 's cool . 
  we , romanians , also have the same red eggs tradition for easter . 
  i 've been an atheist for about five years , but even so , i enjoy this tradition ( which , come to think of it , i do n't see it as being christian at all ) . 
  the same goes for romania . 
  it definitely was . 
  they started broadcasting it on national television in 1990 or 1991 , and this song was on everyone 's lips : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3cq9z3zisq . 
  then around 1993 everybody switched to the newly available cable tv and only house-ladies remained hooked on this kind of stuff . 
   there were some reported cases where workers filled out the questionnaire about religion without even asking the participants or that the workers used pencils which were not allowed . 
  i the exact same thing almost happened to me during the last romanian census , in 2011 . 
  the census worker had the instinct to automatically register me as a christian orthodox , even though i 'm an atheist , and if she had n't asked me `` you are a christian orthodox , no ? '', 
  i 'm pretty sure that i would have been part of the `` romania is christian orthodox '' statistic . 
  i cover my face with a scarf in the winter when the wind and snow are blowing in my face , yes . 
  and , anyway , why does it matter if anyone covers his/her face or not ? 
  but it 's a rhetorical ans stupid question on this sub-reddit anyway . 
  white power all the way !, 
  this is just stupid , whatever way you put it . 
  next thing you know they 'll ban christmas sweaters . 
  wait , they wo n't , because those are worn by normal , white people , just like us . 
  this gives me the creeps . 
  i have to get out of my bucharest office in about 10 minutes , go get my car which i left at home ( for a very good reason , like , the crazy traffic documented in this photo ) and then drive downtown to watch a damn theater play . 
  hope i will not miss the underground parking 's entry . 
   they did not spare bulgaria , and also made bulgaria a vassal state in 1242 . 
  sorry , somehow i did n't know that , i thought the mongols ' attack had only focused on going over the carpathians and destroying stuff in pannonia , did n't know they also went south over the danube towards you , guys . 
  [ 1878 congress of berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_berlin ) , never forget !, 
  we gained dobruja and danube 's delta , but we had to trade southern bessarabia to those pesky russians for it . 
  vlad the impaler actually thought to gain control over a fortress in there , called [ kiliya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiliya ) , so that area should definitely belong to us . 
  no need to dramatize , they spared you of the incoming mongol invasion ( if you can call 2-300 years as `` incoming '' , but i digress ) . 
  look at what this poor [ roger of torre maggiore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roger_of_torre_maggiore ) fellow had to say about it , in his very well named [ sad song for the destruction of the kingdom of hungary by the tartars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carmen_miserabile ) :  we climbed a tall tree and surveyed the land destroyed by the tatars that they had not wasted when they first came . 
  what pain !, 
  we began to walk across the waste and abandoned land that they had destroyed while retreating . 
  church towers were our way signs from one place to another and the road they marked for us was rough . 
  the roads and paths had vanished ; grass and thorn bushes had taken over . 
  well , somehow all that transylvania land now belongs to us , so , i ca n't complain , 
   squatting to shit makes the whole process way easier as well . 
  can confirm . 
  my parents live somewhere in the countryside , no flush toilet no anything , just a hall in the ground in their backyard in a wooden-made thingie . 
  let me tell you that shit-squatting feels indeed much more natural , it 's somehow easier , you do n't have to concentrate , to `` push it through '' , so to speak , it just comes naturally . 
   i 've been squatting on my chair almost totally ot , but you reminded me of [ death note 's l character ] ( http://cdn.toy-tma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/death-note-l.jpg ), 
   or why he think poles are too stupid to follow directions written on the boxes ... 
  i 'm a 36-year old guy who looked at the instructions written on a detergent box for the first time in his life only a week ago . 
  needless to say , i did n't understand that much , there were 3 or 4 pictures of how much detergent to put depending on what clothes , the big issue ( for me , at least ) was that the `` clothes '' part was too general and having no apparent direct connection with the actual clothes from my closet . 
  so of course i continued doing what i had been doing for the last 5 years , at least , meaning putting [ 3 caps of nivea solar cream ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/-wdqg_3d_p50/vuhqkwtz1ei/aaaaaaaajwm/1kutkz3hthi/s1600/nivea_sun_kids_spray_colorat_de%2bprotec%c5%a3ie_solar%c4%83_spf%2b50.jpg ) filled with detergent and then some lenor in the other compartment . 
  i have managed to not ruin any of my clothes by doing this , not sure if the `` diluted '' detergent had anything to do with it . 
  in the same vein , there was also the [ elektronica `` nu , pogodi '' hand-held game ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=electronika+nu+pogodi&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi8ncrovftpahwhaxqkhunidhiq_auicsgc ) that is one of my best memories from around 5th grade ( the early '90s ) . 
  bonus nostalgia link , [ how it sounds , via yt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnprnlktzzi ) . 
  that 's the correct list when it comes to edm . 
  also , 2 romanians in the first 50 and 3 in the first 100 , that 's good . 
   roads are for automobiles , pedestrians should n't be in them in the first place this is bullshit . 
  there 's a road that goes in front of my grandmother 's village house which was initially `` built '' for cows , oxes and carriages . 
  about 10 years ago the road was `` modernized '' , meaning cars are now able to drive on it doing more than 20 km/h . 
  said road has no sidewalks , of course , being a village road . 
  so , what should my grandmother do ? 
  apply for a driver 's license and drive a car at 84 years of age ? 
  i 'm not trying to shift the focus to anything , at least not consciously , i was only trying to imply that painting the situation in syria like black vs white , like only one of the sides has committed war crimes , is hypocritical neighboring on dangerous . 
  what currently happens in syria is a complete cluster-fuck , on all sides , it reminds me of what i had read happened during the spanish civil war . 
  only blaming russia and assad is missing the point , is like only complaining about franco 's troops when it was known that the spanish republicans themselves were doing some pretty shady stuff . 
  the same things were said in more main-stream publications like le monde and le figaro , which have an even more direct connections to the enarques running things in france . 
  if i 'm not mistaken the millionaire hipster who owns les inrocks also owns le monde , everybody knows everybody and has the same opinions . 
   state that if russia is mentioned then someone needs to volunteer to wave their hands frantically and scream `` what about usa !, 
  i would have mentioned france and its hypocrisy directly , no need to blame the usa . 
  just after the revolts against assad started almost nobody was paying attention in the west ( they were all focused on egypt and lybia ) apart from france and the uk ( partially ) . 
  i 'd blame that on old colonialist instincts , but i do n't want to play that game . 
  even a `` respectable '' movie magazine like `` cahiers du cinema '' was idealizing movies about the syrian revolt that were portraying everything as `` bad '' ( assad and his cronies ) vs `` good '' ( the people behind the revolt ) . 
  it did n't matter that many characters present in those movies and documentaries changed into isis and fundamentalist fanboys just months later . 
  and i also remember how the french authorities were among the first to demand the forced elimination of assad , like it had happened in lybia with gaddafi . 
  two of the main streets from bucharest 's old city are/were named after the germans . 
  there 's [ lipscani street ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipscani ) , which was named after the merchants who used to bring their stuff from leipzig ( lipsca , in old romanian speak ) in the 17th-18th century , and intersecting it there is [ smardan street ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/strada_sm%c3%a2rdan ) which used to be called * ulita nemtilor * , meaning the * germans ' street * . 
  do the [ `` decretei '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decree_770 ) mean nothing to you ? 
  i 'll always remember going through my parents ' papers and what-have-you as a kid and finding out a piece of paper coming from the local district attorney office informing my mom that after an inquiry they had found out that they had no grounds for starting a criminal investigation against her for having had an alleged abortion . 
  my parents had never told me about that , and luckily enough at the time i was reading that piece of paper ceausescu had already fallen . 
  are you really not being sarcastic and are you genuinely supporting anti-abortion in a country like romania ? 
  if yes , well ... you should ask your mother and aunts and older lady relatives what they had to go through , that will hopefully change your pretty fucked up opinion . 
   i feel safer driving 150-160 km/h on a motorway , especially if there 's very light traffic , because if i drive 130 km/h i get bored and stop paying attention and not paying attention is more dangerous than driving fast . 
  and then there are the people who still drive on the second line trying to do 150-160 km/h even though both lanes are full , and you see them flashing your ass as you try to pass the people on the first lane ( which are `` only '' doing 100-110km / h ) doing the legal 130 km/h . 
  i hate those people . 
   so the emissions from heating systems in czech cities are very low compared to countryside . 
  saw this in person very well last winter , when i drove through the romanian countryside in december . 
  i had stopped in a remote village for some `` urgent '' needs and did n't know why the air was smelling funny and was foggy . 
  it turns out it was because of the many wood-stoves which were dissipating black smoke from tens of chimneys .
