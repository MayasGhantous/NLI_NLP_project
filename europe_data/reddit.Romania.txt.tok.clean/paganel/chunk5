  multiply that by the huge number of small villages that we still have here in romania and it does n't look pretty . 
  glad i 'm not the only one , i thought i was crazy for feeling this . 
  late-september , october and then april in the spring are usually the worst for this . 
  it 's warm enough during the day and then , bam , come the night you get cold as fuck . 
   after the 2 hour wait at the border with greece i experienced at 7 in the morning on the 3rd wait , really ?!? 
  which border-crossing did you use ? 
  i 'm asking because i 'm about to leave for holidays in greece in a couple of days , by car . 
  was it kulata or makaza by any chance ? 
   they could still travel to the uk on visa . 
  is it legal to hire a person who 's in the uk on a travel visa ? 
  because if it 's not then my point stands . 
  that only means that if i get a job in the uk but my gf does n't , just yet , that she ca n't come with me because there 's no official relationship between us ( in the eyes of the government , at least ) . 
  think of of the `` millennials '' ( i hate the term , but it 's easier to call them that way ) , the majority of them does n't get married until they 're 30 , that would be lots of potential young and valuable employees whom the uk might lose just because . 
  it 's more or less true for romania , yeah . 
  at the end of the 1930s we were just in front of bulgaria and following greece closely . 
  when communism fell the bulgarians were slightly ahead of us and the greeks were way in front of us . 
  greece was the first `` capitalist '' country that i visited , back in 1995 ( i was a teenager ) , and it seemed that the difference between them and us was enormous . 
  i needed this . 
  i had this discussion at least 3 different times on reddit and on hacker news . 
  each time i had to start my comment with `` i grew up on the eastern side of the wall '' , to add a little more credibility to my sayings , because it seems that just basic facts and logic would n't cut it with most of said `` there was no true socialism until now '' - believers . 
  it 's also interesting that most of them have had a well cushioned and cozy capitalist life-style for their entire existence . 
  mention half-day power-cuts in the middle of winter or how there was no toilet-paper to buy ( i 've heard the same thing happens now in venezuela ) and you get replies like : `` that 's because your leaders were incompetent so-called socialist leaders . 
  in a real socialist system there will be stuff for everybody ! '', 
  if it were any other country than saudi arabia i would have agreed with you , but selling weapons worth billions of pounds/euros / $ to those people over there while pretending that you 're still a democratic and western country that follows the rule of law is absolute bullshit . 
  more to the point , i have a very close friend who works in saudi arabia , near the iraqi border , in the more conservative part of that country , as he put it ( he works for the other major european defense company , the one run by the germans and the french , so you brits are not alone in this ) . 
  the stories he told me about life in saudi arabia are absolutely out of this world , it 's like they 're living in the early middle ages . 
  women are treated like cattle over there , basically , if you 're born a woman in saudi arabia you might as well be dead the next day , because your life is not worth anything , your wishes do n't even exist , your personality and very own existence are seen as being bellow that of a camel . 
  you 're a piece of meat that 's supposed to have kids from time to time and then you should just disappear , as a woman . 
  this being / r/europe i thought i was free of the michael phelps circlejerk affecting the rest of the us-dominated sections of reddit . 
  i was wrong . 
  i do , it 's an amazing sport . 
  you should give it a try if you have n't already . 
  i 've also been to water-polo matches in person , there 's a pretty cool ( actually hot and humid ) atmosphere in there . 
  i 'm not an american so i do n't really care about hillary winning or not , just wanted to bring [ this tuzla incident to your attention ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bfnqhv5hg4 ) . 
  that was a blatant lie from hillary . 
  i 'm sure there are others from where that came from . 
  americans deserve better than having to chose between an overly-ambitious liar and an ego-maniac . 
  cool to see [ a photo ] ( http://calvertjournal.com/images/uploads/features/2016_aug/power_and_architecture_part_3/gherca/4.jpg ) one of my former neighborhoods on the front page of / r/europe . 
  anyway , things in real life are a lot more nuanced than the article makes it out to be , i personally grew to like most of the `` communist '' buildings ( apart from the palace of parliament ) , they were a lot more functional than you get today , lots of them had bigger rooms compared to what you 'd get buying a `` capitalist '' apartment nowadays ( and real kitchens and hallways , to boot , not the `` shared living-room '' crap ) . 
  here are [ a couple ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/12368222@n04/2293610010/in/dateposted-public/ ) [ of photos ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/12368222@n04/2293610010/in/dateposted-public/ ) of [ said ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/12368222@n04/2292823861/in/dateposted-public/ ) [ neighborhood ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/12368222@n04/2293617002/in/dateposted-public/ ) . 
   the emission laws in america are much harsher for diesel . 
  and for good reason . 
  i 've been living in an apartment downtown for about a year or so , close to a very big intersection , and let me tell you that faulty diesel engines pollute thousands of times more than faulty gasoline engines . 
  this is only an empirical observation ( mine ) , based on me watching the tv with my window open ( i live on the 8th floor ) and from time to time getting to smell diesel fumes inside of my home . 
  it 's always diesel . 
  is bergen any better ? 
  i was tempted to visit it and the fjords around it sometime next summer ( maybe go up-north to trondheim ) , i 'm still debating it over a tour of rural france . 
  i 'm oky with that . 
  i really hope they came back for [ stephen the great 's sword ] ( http://sword-site.com/thread/769/sword-stephen-great-iii-moldavia ) . 
  i 've been to athens and istanbul from that list , they ca n't compete against rome when it comes to ancient history and architecture . 
  this comes from a guy who looked at moving to athens before the whole crisis came up , so i ca n't say that i 'm biased against rome . 
  can confirm . 
  visited rome for a few days for the first time ever last november and it was a blast . 
  granted , i 'm an history and architecture fanboy , so it would have been very hard for me to leave that place disappointed . 
   the fact that it is in absolute chaos . 
  in the pisa ratings we placed under ukraine , a damn warzone , and the numbers keep falling every year . 
  happen to have any link that details the situation ? 
  we have a far worse educational system here in romania but you guys ' education systems from up-north are always given to us as examples to follow . 
  i 'm just curious what went wrong in sweden 's case , and why . 
  it 's not the eu 's fault that it takes some `` mediterranean '' people [ 50 years ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italys-eternally-unfinished-highway-enters-final-stretch-50-years-after-construction-began-10261986.html ) for completing a highway . 
  in other news , italy 's rough standing is caused by they sleeping on their laurels and not keeping up with technological change . 
  their it industry is close to non-existent , even though olivetti was a huge thing in the it industry back in the '80s , the car industry ( i.e. 
  fiat ) has become sort of a joke among its potential customers , its white-appliance industry is receiving very strong competition from the likes of turkey and china ( and , honestly , you ca n't remain a g7 country based on only selling fridges and air-conditioners ) while its services industry ( apart from tourism ) is , well , sort of lacking ( italians ' trouble for learning english has also something to do with it , see how a well-traveled person like antonio conte only now gets to learn english , when appointed as manager of chelsea ) . 
   the article claims that there was 500-600 more but not a single photo of them ever what ?!, 
  they actually said that ? 
  hahahah , seriously , i ca n't stop laughing . 
  if it were at least 10 % true ( meaning if there had been 50-60 russian casualties ) / r/syriancivilwar would have been debating it for at least a week , with photos , geo-mapped locations and all that . 
  you 're right . 
  i think that somewhere in the new testament there 's a passage telling women that they can not enter a church/god 's house without something covering their head . 
  this is why whenever i read about banning the `` muslim '' scarves for `` cultural and historic reasons '' i get a really good laugh . 
  the same goes for romania . 
  my grandma , who 's in her mid-80s , would not dream of getting out of her countryside yard without her headscarf on , you might as well ask her to go out naked in the street . 
  really cool from the swedes . 
  they also helped us back in 1947 , when eastern romania ( the historical province of moldova ) was hit by a severe drought , which coupled with the post-war effects caused severe famine . 
  there 's this [ youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ouyecbsvd8 ) , narrated in swedish , which presents some images from back then . 
  glad i 'm not the only one . 
  i tried watching firefly 10 years ago , only made it through the first episode and a half . 
  i 've also recently tried to watch all of mr robot 's first season , only made it through the first 2 episodes , it feels too formulaic for me , it tries and manages to click all the right buttons with nothing left for the unexpected , for the sentiment of surprise . 
  and i 'm in the right demographic for both these shows : i 'm a computer programmer who used to watch st : tng in his youth ( i 'm talking the early '90s ) . 
   her elders chide her for asking the wrong questions , of course the plot of a kabuki play makes no sense !, 
  it 's called [ `` suspension of disbelief '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suspension_of_disbelief ) , it 's one of the main things behind the art of theater ( of which kabuki is a part of ) . 
  maybe younger people today ( i 'm in my mid-30s ) have a tougher time getting in `` on the game '' ( which is by now ~ 2,500 years old ) , i remember i had similar feelings when i first watched a live theater play when i was 12 . 
  i was asking myself : `` is that letter the actor is reading true ? 
  does it actually contain the words that come out of his mouth as he 's reading it ? '' . 
  by age 19-20 the art of theater had already grown on me , fortunately ( i personally consider it one of the best art forms our species ever invented ) . 
  can confirm . 
  was in lausanne at the end of the european championship and there were portuguese flags hanging from everywhere . 
  after portugal 's win in the semifinal the center of the city got cordoned off by the police because the portuguese invaded it to celebrate the victory . 
  it was pretty cool . 
  also , did n't know until that moment that there were that many portuguese people living in that area ( the swiss side of the lake leman ), 
   1 ) crack down on mosques by pushing for only certification of imams through a french branch of islam . 
  this has been shown historically to not work . 
  early christianism is a good example , when roman emperors who were against it went against the churches and its believers very hard to no avail . 
  if you close down a mosque another one will show up in its place , this time in a clandestine way , which will make even more hard for police to have control of people who are about to be radicalized . 
  even in stalinist russia people were celebrating christmas and easter , even though stalin had demolished churches hundreds of years old . 
   2 ) expel any church found to be taking donations from countries that espouse views conflicting to western values first , you need to better define western values . 
  as an eastern european the brits are western people for me , and one of their recent `` values '' is that immigrants are bad , including us . 
  it 's a slippery slope . 
   3 ) temporary cessation of all immigration from muslim majority countries you ca n't do that , logistically . 
  people still managed to cross the iron border between the eastern and the western block back in the day , when the border between the two blocks was one of the most militarized in the history of humanity , you can not block people from crossing a border thousands of kilometers longs if they really want to .
