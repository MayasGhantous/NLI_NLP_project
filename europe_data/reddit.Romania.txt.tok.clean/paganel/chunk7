  3km-long lines are not reasonable by any stretch of the imagination . 
  and saying that this new shitty thing is good because we are already in a shitty situation does not do your argument any favors . 
   if your idea of punishment is standing in line 1-2 hour longer because schengen implementend perfectly reasonable security measures any common travel area should have regardless of what happened in the years before , then i envy your life . 
  i traveled by car between hungary and austria last summer , i took the m1 high-way . 
  while i was approaching the austrian border there were signs above the highway warning us on there being a 3km-long line at the border . 
  i thought that they were exaggerating . 
  in fact that was the honest truth . 
  we waited for about 1 and half hours , inching along every half minute or so , until i noticed that lots of people were taking a right-hand exit . 
  intrigued , i followed them , and very quickly got re-routed into a parallel national road which was passing the same austrian-hungary border and which had way laxer checks ( you were n't supposed to stop the car while the border-guard was looking at you ) . 
  we only needed 5 more minutes to pass the border , while had we decided to remain on the highway it would have taken us at least one more hour . 
  this is all just security theater . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@47.9275521,17.1325079,14z/data=!3m1!1e3 ) is the border in question on gmaps , you can see how the high-way and the national road are parallel and very close together , but they 're serviced by different custom offices . 
   so you were the smelly hobo in the back , right ? 
  we have those in bucharest , too . 
  they prefer trams over [ citaro buses ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=citaro+bucuresti&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzzfru_irtahwf0rokhsowbjkq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=897 ) . 
  a couple of weeks ago i had to tell one of them not to lighten their f.cking cigarette while still inside the tram . 
  eastern-european trams are the best looking trams !, 
  the only exception are those from vienna . 
  as a kid who grew up in the '80s in a town very close to the romanian-bulgarian border my evenings were always quite enjoyable thanks to the [ leka nosht , deca !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ylmlx53zvm&amp;list=pl1279d92d6d76804d ) tv show . 
  i get almost instant goosebumps every time i re-listen to those songs on yt , every 6 months or so . 
  [ here 's a google streetview link ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.4530857,26.104531,3a,49.2y,190.78h,99.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1su2lny0cjcmblilvawlpv6w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) on how those 2 buildings look today . 
  i quite like them , they 're the only 1930s modernist buildings left on the entire stefan cel mare boulevard ( not that there were many there to begin with ) . 
  i was in lausanne during the last euro championship , which i realized was the portuguese capital of switzerland . 
  half of the flags on display on people 's windows were portuguese , and after the semi-final between portugal and wales the downtown area got invaded by portuguese fans crazy with joy . 
  it was marvelous , it reminded me of going to bucharest 's downtown area after we beat and eliminated england in 2000 with a 90-minute penalty . 
  you think mi5 you think delusional oxbridge graduates who believe in communism and who are willing to sell their country because of it . 
  later edit : to those people downvoting this comment , what exactly made you downvote it ? 
  is it not correct ? 
  most of the cambridge moles did indeed work for mi6 , but mi5 , under whose nose all of these things happened , did almost nothing to catch them for almost 20 years . 
  on top of that , one of the soviets ' earliest recruits , anthony blunt , [ did indeed work for mi5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthony_blunt#joining_mi5 ) . 
  this is what i do n't understand at people who do n't take their shoes off in other people 's houses : why would you bring a homeless 's piss inside peoples ' homes ? 
  because i bet you 100 % that once you walk more than 200m in a big european city you 'd step into some shitty thing , like piss . 
  i 'm not the one making stupid rationalizations for my stupid deeds , you are . 
  damn , some people are just plain evil and ignorant about it when they want it , and that includes you . 
  i always loved it when i was watching football matches on italian television and hearing the italian commentators calling munich as `` monaco di baviera '' . 
  any stories behind that ? 
  as a lover of almost all things italy-related rome blew me away when i visited it about a year ago , had the it jobs situation been better in italy ( the same as in berlin or in london , lets say ) i would definitely consider moving in there . 
   fantastic public transport i have said to myself that i would never emigrate to another european city which does n't have a decent tramway network ( bucharest used to have a great one , now it 's slowly dying out , which makes me sad to no-end , but that 's another story ) . 
  vienna is one of the few cities which fit this , i absolutely loved its tramways . 
   also , humans eat way more clever animals than whales . 
  which are those animals ? 
  link to any study ? 
  maybe dolphins and some primates might fill that category , but no-one sane would advocate `` killing whales because dolphins are smarter than them '' . 
  because i personally regard them as above most of the rest of the animals , as they can pass the [ mirror test ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirror_test ) , the same as dolphins , elephants , some primates ( including us , humans ) and the european magpie . 
  you do you , you being norwegian and all that and apparently your tradition requiring you to kill these very smart animals , but do n't hide this under the general `` they 're like the rest of the animals ! '' . 
  they 're not . 
  found [ this ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/27-02-2017-rra-measles-romania,%20european%20union%20countries.pdf ) ( pdf link ) , and it looks like i was partially wrong , there was a similar measles epidemic in 2011-2012 . 
  anyway , this current outbreak ca n't be attributed to social-economic causes , because we see that most of the cases have happened in the western part of the country , and not in the much poorer east and south . 
  what i suspect is happening is that a lot of those cases are happening in pentecostal and adventist families ( many of them also roma ) from western romania , which are indeed as anti-vaxers as you can get . 
  the 2 or 3 idiot mums from my fb list who are against vaccines are all definitely middle-class , they 're not roma , they 're not poor . 
  we should stop with this non-sense `` they died because they could n't afford a vaccine '' , the numbers tell a different story , i.e. 
  when we were much poorer as a nation , 10 to 15 years ago , even 20 to 25 , we did n't have this kind of thing happening . 
  the jews from [ maramure\u0219 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maramure%c8%99 ) have always appeared very interesting to me . 
  afaik they were one of the few jewish communities from all europe ( maybe the only one ) who had also chosen to lead a pastoral life , more exactly who had chosen to be shepherds . 
  there are not that many online articles talking about them , unfortunately , a quick google search pointed [ me to this ] ( https://frgheorghe.wordpress.com/strabunicul-meu-a-fost-evreu/ ) ( article in romanian , but a couple of very interesting images ), 
   were frying bread , eggs and sugar to kids when they asked for candy because we could n't get it . 
  i know what you 're saying because i lived the '80s as a kid ( power cuts , almost no heating in the winter etc etc ) , but that [ fried bread with eggs and sugar ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=paine+prajita+cu+oua&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjc8myellvsahxkjjokhwuzdqgq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613 ) was one of the best things ever . 
  my mother stopped making it when i grew older , but i recently re-discovered it when vacationing on the bulgarian seaside , they serve it at breakfast . 
  next thing you know you 'll call the [ sz\u00e9kelys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kelys ) as being romanians  i do n't give a crap , though , if you brits do n't want to be a civilized and open country anymore then it 's fine with me , you can spend the rest of your lives eating meat-pies and drooling over european football managers like they 're the second coming of christ . 
  as a romanian who used to eat sunflower seeds at 3rd division matches in the early '90s i can confirm this . 
  also , i miss the '90s when we were actually good at football as a nation . 
   i mean ... yes ? 
  that 's because you 're protestants . 
  i do n't know how catholics fare when it comes to reading the bible , but living in a christian orthodox country i can certainly say that the big majority of the people who profess their being religious around me have not read any of the four gospels from the new testament . 
  i 'm mostly an atheist myself ( i only become religious and ask for things from god when there 's a tense football match involving my team , like a penalty shootout ) and whenever i have religious discussions with people i know i mostly always find out that they 've not read important stuff from the bible ( i 'm not talking strange things like how much hair an animal should have before i could eat it , or whatever else the old testament has written down in it ) . 
  and these are young people i 'm talking about , the old ladies who actually fill the churches have not read anything other then the tv schedule in a very long time . 
   in europe you use sequential dates yeah , but most of us spend most of our time on the internet , where the `` wrong '' order is used , and which can very easily `` spill '' out into real-world usage , no matter if we 're in europe or not . 
  not to mention that i used the roman notation as a kid since first or second grade ( meaning i was 7 or 8 years old ) , there was no complexity to speak of . 
  how about 2017.02.04 vs 04.02.2017 ? 
  hell if i know which is which , i have to think : am i on an american-run website or not ? 
  compared to that dates like `` 4-ii-2017 '' are super simple to parse , as long as you know that the roman numerals represent month numbers . 
  also take into consideration that in the romance languages almost all month names come from the romans . 
  i started following him on fb also for lulz about 2-3 years ago and was terrified to find out that trump most likely watches his shows in a serious manner . 
  too lazy to look for the article itself , i read it about 2-3 days ago . 
  my gf 's boss decided not to attend one of romania 's matches in last year 's european championship ( i think it was one of the matches we played in paris ) . 
  he and his friends had bought the tickets already but decided to cancel it off sometimes around march or april 2016 , if i remember correctly . 
  almost no recourse , afaik . 
  it was given as a government executive order , not through parliament , and because of that it can not be attacked before the constitutional court ( not to mention that there was no public debating ) . 
  the only recourse are street-protests , which are happening right now ( as i write this i 'm about to get out and protest in the street ) . 
  it 's pure thuggery , it 's hard to explain , everybody feels so betrayed . 
  as a guy who grew up in a danube river further downstream i like these danube facts . 
  a former high-school colleague of mine was very close to dying of co poisoning when i was in 10th grade . 
  she , together with her parents , had rented out a cabin somewhere in the mountains ( or were visiting some relatives in the countryside , ca n't remember exactly ) and as they went to sleep everything was ok . at around 3-4 in the morning her dad woke up because of stomach troubles ( because of `` too much farting '' as my colleague said , this one i remember exactly ) and `` noticed something strange '' , he was way too sleepy and tired , even if he had just woken up . 
  luckily enough he immediately opened the windows and woke up his wife and his daughter ( my colleague ) , which saved their lives , as the stove had been emitting co. . as my colleague told us later her father 's farting actually saved their lives . 
  i remember she then had to go to the hospital every 3 months or so for the next year for neurological consultations , in order to check that nothing in her brain had been fucked up by the lack of oxygen . 
  scary stuff , even if it happened 20 + years ago . 
  who wo n't allow me to drive my manual car ? 
  is it the government ? 
  if the answer is `` yes '' then my reaction would be instant : i will vote against that government and try to replace it with people who think like me . 
  and lets not forget about all the [ anjou family members ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capetian_house_of_anjou#hungary ) that ruled the kingdom of hungary in the 1300s . 
  i also find it fascinating how louis the great of said list of family members [ battled the kingdom of naples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neapolitan_campaigns_of_louis_the_great ) on its own turf . 
   it 's that bro-like highly competative attitude that makes the money . 
  it 's that bro-like attitude that created the libor scandal which affected the lives of millions of people . 
  too lazy to search for it now , but in one of the emails one of the traders was promising an expensive bottle of champaigne to a trader from another bank if only the latter would help him out with something that proved out to be illegal . 
   it 's that bro-like highly competative attitude that makes the money . 
  without taxpayers ' money all the finance industry would have been bust in october 2008 and the years following that date . 
  this is a fact . 
  they do n't `` make '' money , they 're merely rent-seekers . 
   2 ) frankfurt and geneva are considered boring and unappealing places for bankers to live , particularly the former .
