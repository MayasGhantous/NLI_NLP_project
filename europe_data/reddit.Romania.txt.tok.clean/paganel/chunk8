  paris is out because of punitive tax and sleepy work attitudes banking and finance generally speaking should be a boring job ( yes , including investment banking ) , maybe this would be a good way of weeding out the bro ' - like people from this industry . 
  i do n't feel comfortable knowing that a person handling billions of euros / $ every day and taking decisions that affect the lives of millions of people likes partying with drugs and the like until 3am . 
  was there , cold as hell , hope we did manage to send a message and that the message was received by those in charge of running things in this country . 
   unfortunate comparison . 
  both paris and rome are in a league of their own . 
  i love both , but as an history and architecture buff i would say that rome is just a little ahead of paris . 
  we can blame [ baron haussmann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georges-eug%c3%a8ne_haussmann ) for that , but even then , paris does n't have all that ancient history which rome has . 
  istanbul also left a really profound impression on me . 
  one of the best coffees i ever had was an 1euro ristretto i drank around midnight in a gas station on autostrada a4 . 
  italians sure know how to make coffee . 
  i 'm personally more aggrieved by the fact that the soviets took the [ hertza region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hertza_region ) from us in 1940 and gave it to the ukrainians , and it will probably never come back to us , even though it had never been under foreign occupation since the principality of moldova was formed in the late 1300s . 
  as for bessarabia there 's nothing that us romanians can do , now . 
  out of the last 200 + years we 've gotten hold of it for only 25 years or so . 
  i 've read the works of an inter-war romanian sociologist , named [ anton golopentia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_golopen%c8%9bia ) , who was sent in the late 1920s-early 1930s to document the lives of romanian peasants in bessarabia . 
  he was saying that he used to see pictures of the late tzar nikolai ii hung on the walls of many romanian peasants ' houses , close to the image of virgin mary and jesus christ . 
  for whatever reason i also can not forgive imperialist russia for taking [ budjak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budjak ) from us after the treaty of berlin in 1878 . 
  i know that romanians do n't form a majority in there , it 's just that i love the landscapes ( based on googlemaps photos ) and the history of the place . 
  i think the skoda octavia is seen as being more reliable than the vw passat . 
  add to that the fact that octavia is cheaper than the passat and that they 're pretty much in the same class and built on the same platform and you 've got a pretty good reason for why people buy skoda over vw . 
  in my particular case it also does n't help that i have a friend who owns a car repair 's shop and who always posts car-repair horror stories on fb ( including photos ) involving vw vehicles ( mostly passats , some touaregs and tiguans ) . 
  the village where my parents live used to depend heavily on grain agriculture . 
  when harvest time came all the village was on the field working for several days up to a week ( on top of the previous works they had done prior to harvest time , like seeding and the like ) . 
  nowadays the work that used to cost hundreds if not thousands of man-hours is done in a single night by a big gps-powered john deere combine harvester . 
  there 's almost no work available for anyone left in the village , so that most of the young people left ( either to romanian towns or to italy and spain ) . 
   the actual tradition is throwing the cross in the water , it has nothing to do with that . 
  we also have that , but you actually made me realized that i 've mostly heard about this tradition in the southern and south-eastern parts of our country ( meaning close to the border with you , guys ) . 
  it 's a tradition mostly respected in the cities close to the danube , from [ tulcea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tulcea ) up-river to [ drobeta-turnu severin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drobeta-turnu_severin ) , the two seaside cities/towns of constanta and mangalia , and that 's about it . 
  is op 's username relevant ?!, 
  i mean , it is in romanian . 
  i can run away from a guy threatening me with a katana sword ( or pliers or whatever medieval nasty thing you can think about ) , i can not outrun a bullet . 
  romania already is close to `` nazi germany '' when it comes to gun ownership ( you can get prison time if you do n't have a permit for a handgun , which is pretty hard to obtain ) and i do n't care at all about owning guns or ever wanting to own them . 
  they 're barbarous . 
  as a classic romanian summer ritual i visited balchik and albena this august and the all the restaurant menus were in romanian ( and english and bulgarian ) and some of the waiters were speaking our language , too . 
  that was cool . 
  am not mediterranean but we did cook steaks with olive oil a couple of days ago ( well , my gf did ) . 
  it was delicious . 
  my peasant grandma who lives close to the carpathian mountains uses [ untur\u0103 ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=untura&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=897&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjt7fil-oprahxcbbokhcpxcbkq_auiccgb ) for cooking meat , it 's one of of the most delicious things ever ( it 's basically just cow fat which melts once you cook it ) . 
  my grandma makes her own butter and i 've never in my life saw her using it for cooking stuff . 
  we have [ those over here in romania , too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mee3tbtp4z0 ) , i found them kind of cute , even though i would n't want to meet them face to face . 
  it 's not , that 's how most of the people died during our 1989 `` revolution '' , i.e. 
  regular citizens got hold of lots of arms and they started shooting at anything that seemed `` suspicious '' . 
  my father told me a story about how he and other men had been called to guard some `` important objective '' in my home-town , population 70,000 , and how at some point an helicopter was suddenly seen flying above their heads . 
  a not so-smart colleague of his suggested that they all started shooting in the direction of the helicopter , because they might be terrorists , fortunately men like my dad convinced said stupid people that there were no actual terrorists in that helicopter and no-one got killed . 
  but this was a happy case , for not such a happy story you can check what happened at the otopeni airport [ where 40 young recruits were killed by other soldiers just because the latter thought that the recruits were terrorists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_revolution ) . 
   at that time fierce fights were underway at bucharest otopeni international airport between troops sent against each other under claims that they were going to confront terrorists . 
  early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon . 
  [ 34 ] these troops were from the um 0865 campina military base , and were summoned there by gen. ion rus , the commander of the romanian air force . 
  [ 34 ] the confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians . 
  [ 34 ] the military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport 's perimeter , passing several checkpoints . 
  [ 34 ] however , after passing the last checkpoint , being on their way to the airport , they were fired upon from different directions . 
  [ 34 ] a civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight . 
  [ 34 ] after the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport , who seemed to think that they were loyal to ceausescu 's regime . 
  that you offended the op by hinting that bbc ( one of the pillars of the `` western '' media ) might be biased in its reporting . 
  plus , almost anything pro-russia in this sub-reddit is taboo , and saying that bbc have a bias against russia is , well , pro-russia ( even though that 's the damn blatant truth ) . 
  can confirm . 
  my parents live in the romanian countryside and have two cats . 
  one of them is indeed scared of mice as my father is , but the other one does its job perfectly at catching rodents , even though she 's just a blob of fur at this moment . 
  pictures of [ said blob ] ( http://imgur.com/a/k167n ) , because this is reddit and i 'm not ashamed of posting cat photos . 
   ) ) thx , that 's been a good laugh , first time in my life when i 've been called a `` neo-con '' . 
  the same goes for the economist , on the other side of the political spectrum . 
  they used to be more than decent until this year ( as long as you ignored their `` leaders '' / editorials , which i did ) . 
  this far this year i 've seen them comparing corbyn to lenin/marx/stalin ( the lenin comparison might have been explicit , am too lazy to search for it ) , ignoring the myriad details of the syrian civil war and only pushing the `` assad is pure evil '' mantra and `` the rebels are all of them freedom fighters '' , painting putin as an old-school dictator that 's out of control ( / r/europe also does this , but at least nobody is paying anything to read it ) , telling us that everything that comes out of china is bad if it comes from the chinese government and good if it comes from the people opposing the government ( including positive remarks in regards to the [ falun gong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falun_gong ) sect , which is some crazy-shit cult like the scientologists ) and on top of it all the us presidential campaign , where everything coming out of trump 's mouth might as well been spoken by the devil himself and everything that was being said by hillary was thoughtful and `` intellectual '' . 
  i 've been reading them for about 10 years now , but i think i 'll leave them behind . 
   ( hungarians buy those cars because slovakians tax car ownership less . ), 
  my gf saw a car with bulgarian plates in downtown bucharest carrying the romanian flag ( because national holiday ) . 
  romanians buy those cars because bulgarians tax car ownership less . 
  til . 
  am romanian , did n't know we actually had that on our coat of arms . 
  granted , i grew up as a kid with a slightly [ different coat of arms ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/republica_socialist%c4%83_rom%c3%a2nia#/media/file:coat_of_arms_of_the_socialist_republic_of_romania.svg ) . 
  yeah , that 's why i came in here to comment , wanting to mention the other mediterranean foods . 
  it 's crazy that if you only go a couple of hundred kilometers north of the mediterranean food starts to get bland . 
  us romanians were smart at least and adopted our national food , [ sarmale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarma_%28food%29 ) , from the turks . 
  guess what , you did n't account for the ( i 'd say quite huge ) difference in income and especially education between romania and switzerland , which alone would explain why we still kill ourselves more than the swiss do . 
  now just imagine if we had access to actual guns instead of relying on good-old knives and what-have-you , i 'm pretty sure we 'd be up-there with the us . 
  anyway , if you ever plan on visiting bucharest feel free to do it , it 's one of the safest cities in europe ( not sure if you 've ever visited europe or you 're just making statements about what 's happening around here based only on statistics ) . 
  i would n't say the same about most of the swiss cities after certain hours of the night , but i 'm pretty sure you 'll find a statistic for that one , too ( hint : romania has close to no immigrants that are `` hard-to-integrate '' , most of the statistics you mention involve people hitting each other in the head out in the countryside for stupid fights ) . 
  and just fyi , here 's what [ i 'm talking about ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_bucharest ) :  n 2013 , violent crimes fell by 13 % from 2012 , however there was a slight increase in murders compared to 2007 with 19 recorded murders ( with suspects being arrested for 18 of them ) . 
  [ 2 ] yet , considering the city 's population of approximately 2 million , the number of violent crimes are considered low without a notable impact on public life . 
  show me another big city in europe where you 've only got 19 murders per year for a city of 2 million people and i 'm packing my bags right now and move there . 
  most of the criminals in my country ( i 'd say 99 % ) do not use firearms when doing their criminal things . 
  in fact , when some of them eventually do ( using lousy hand-guns and such ) it makes the news big time . 
   and you can tell them that you did n't want to be barbaric when and if they come after yo i had a friend of a friend in high-school who got on the wrong side of some of those `` criminals '' and he ended up with a sword cut on his face ( we 're talking about the mid - '90s , those were wilder times ) . 
  if said criminals had had looser access to guns then i 'm sure said friend of a friend would have ended up dead . 
  again , croatia is a special case because of the crazy things that happened there in the '90s , but you 're the exception that needs to be sort of cleaned out , we can not make exceptions because of special cases . 
   if i wanted i could come to france with a trunk full of guns , rifles and grenades within 2 days from now by car , and the only thing that could stop me is the highway patrolls that stop one in a thousand cars . 
  croatia is a special case because of the yugoslav wars in the mid - '90s . 
  i agree , the ue should have done more at cleaning the huge private arsenals that were left there after the war ended . 
  i for myself live in a country where you 'd be hard-pressed to find a gun , and were you to use or own one ( outside of hunting , which is not that widespread either ) you 'd be in jail pretty fast . 
  it 's not a pedestal . 
  it 's telling that most of the responses telling me that i 'm wrong come from people who live in some of the few countries in europe which still cherish having tools that kill people ( norway , croatia and the initial swiss op ) . 
  because owning and using guns has become barbaric for lots of people ( including myself ) and in this respect i 'd say brussels is doing the right thing . 
  i also think that the majority of the eu citizens are anti-guns , thank god for that . 
   hell , switzerland is a confederation more tightly integrated than the eu and here even the swiss federal state can not legiferate on this without the cantons because it would be a power overreach if you do n't like it you can always opt out of the economic arrangement the swiss signed with the eu . 
  like i said before , anti-gun laws are supported by most of the eu citizens , no `` fetish for centralized power '' is involved in here . 
  unfortunately it seems that the swiss are different in this respect , hence my suggestion that if you do n't like it then you can always leave the negotiating table . 
  yeah , i 'm a [ rapid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_rapid_bucure%c8%99ti ) fan myself , we played you guys back in the uefa cup about 10 years ago , i think , there 's still random paok graffiti around bucharest if you look close enough . 
  that or maybe the local greek students are all paok fans , 
   now , in the last 2 years karypidis has bought another team ( one of the biggest teams in greece they play for some years in the 3rd-2nd division and technically he gave the first team . 
  but this happened only on paper damn , did n't know that team was [ aris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aris_thessaloniki_f.c . ), 
  i follow the greek first league from afar and had seen that they had descended into the lower leagues , but had hoped that they would end up in better hands .
