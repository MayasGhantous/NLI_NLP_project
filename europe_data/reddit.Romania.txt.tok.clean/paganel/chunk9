  they 've got great fans , some years ago i was listening [ to this video of them ] each day , several times a day . 
  and crypto-coin mining . 
  actually , i 've heard of friends-of-friends who got a nice stash of cash out of it ( between 30,000 to 100,000 euros ) , but for every case like that that 's tens or hundreds of other cases who are too late to the game . 
  i guess that 's how a bubble builds itself . 
  after the battle of mohachs in 1526 they reached central europe where they staid for the next 200 years or so . 
  as a matter of fact there 's some minarets less than 100 km from where i 'm writing this comment ( bucharest ) , and they 've been there for the last 600-700 years , give or take . 
  i 'm talking about the muslim community living in ne bulgaria . 
  ah , yeah , right , 
  right now weather.com tells me that there 's 80 % humidity in monaco , at [ this link ] ( https://weather.com/wx/today/?lat=43.74&amp;lon=7.42&amp;locale=en_us&amp;par=google&amp;temp=c ) . 
  it 's 9.55 pm on there . 
  i searched around other cities in that general geographic area and i found out that for example udine and brescia both have humidity level in the high 60s , even though they 're several hundred kilometers inland . 
  you can make safer and surer bets than this one . 
   oh and he killed 52 aristocratic families ( 1/3 to a half of bulgarian aristocracy of the time ) including the woman and children related to this , there 's an apocryphal story reguarding our own vlad the impaler and his building of the [ poenari castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poenari_castle ) . 
  for a reason that i forgot he forced many boyars , together with their wife and children , to help with the building of the castle , in gruesome conditions . 
  one of the boyars starts complaining : `` your highness , my wife is pregnant , can you please spare her the carrying of big rocks ? '' . 
  at which vlad responds : `` from now on she 'll have to carry two rocks , one for her , and one for the baby inside her '' . 
  still one of the greatest rulers we 've ever had . 
   i at least unserstand it now . 
  never realized soccer being so intwined with religion though to this day most of us rapid fans see [ steaua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_steaua_bucure%c8%99ti ) and [ dinamo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_dinamo_bucure%c8%99ti ) as communist teams imposed by the occupying soviet troops immediately after ww2 , it does n't get any more political than that . 
  we sort of tend to ignore that our own team was supported by [ gheorghe gheorghiu-dej ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheorghe_gheorghiu-dej ) , the biggest communist ruler in our country after ww2 and before ceausescu came to power , because he had been a railways worker and our team is , by definition , the team of railways workers from all over romania ( or at least it was so when it was founded , back in 1923 ) . 
  glad it was n't divan . 
  idomemo\u0219 is a hit and miss , is definitely a miss if you 've got a weaker stomach or you caught the cook during a day when he forgot to wash his hands , but if you 've got a stronger stomach it can be actually good for the prices they demand . 
  i for myself have only eaten there twice of thrice , but i 've completely started to avoid them ( even though i work only a block away from them ) since i 've started feeling that my stomach is not what it used to be when i was younger . 
   i would make absolutely no difference and ca n't tell if it 's a video about romanian or bulgarian village . 
  the clothes , the look of the people , the little things in the shop . 
  i grew up in a romanian city on the danube just across from bulgaria , and my parents now live in a small village nearby ( as did my grand-parents and grand-grand-parents ) . 
  when i first visited bulgaria as a grown-up i was surprised to see that the houses looked exactly the same as my grandma 's house , that the old ladies were dressing the same as my grandma , that they were holding their hands around their mouths just as my grandma was doing etc. 
  i always tell my friends that there 's a much bigger difference between the people where i grew up and the romanians from transylvania ( there 's about 300-400 km separating them ) , from example , than between the same people and the bulgarians that live just across the danube . 
  which , if you put it this way in writing makes sense , but when you learn in school that the romanian people is unique and not like any other people out-there then you start having doubts , as a kid . 
  we also imported the [ kukeri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukeri ) tradition from the bulgarians ( we call them * cuci * ) , and i was very surprised when i grew up and went to bucharest ( that 's 120 km away from my home city ) and found out that people over there had n't heard of it . 
  we also have the tradition of hanging a black piece of cloth with the name of the deceased person on the walls of said deceased person 's house , which again i was surprised to see that 's not known and not practised in bucharest . 
  too lazy to search for links but there have been countless articles on / r/europe about how food is more expensive in the former eastern bloc countries compared to the western ones ( mostly prices in poland and czechia vs germany ) . 
  sort of the same thing happens for clothes . 
  for example over here in romania you almost never can find decent clothes during the sales season at more than a 20 % price discount , which is ridiculous , imho , while in greece ( and in vienna , barcelona or , heck , even london ) i was able to find pretty decent clothes at 70-80 % discount during the sales season . 
  matter of fact i still have a couple of excellent t-shirts that i bought at primark in london for 5 pounds each 7 years ago . 
  might actually do that , thx for reminding me  we drive by car all the way south to piraeus and i was torn between spending the night in thessaloniki or somewhere in the vicinity . 
  i think we 'll choose thessaloniki . 
  told my gf that we should vacation somewhere in the greek islands later this summer so that we could shop on ermou street on our way there ( the sales prices are much smaller in greece compared to what we get here in romania ) . 
  actions like this one make me want to reconsider . 
  you 're an interista , are n't you ? 
  feel free to join us watching cl football anytime you want , 
   people tend to perceive countries like greece , italy , spain through the tourist bubble they experience when visiting during holidays i love greece , but even as a tourist if you care enough to open your eyes you can see the painful changes the country has had to go through . 
  there was a huge difference between me visiting athens as a tourist in 2007 ( before the crisis started ) and again in 2012 and 2013 . 
  during the later visits there were huge piles of garbage on the side of the street and the number of homeless people seemed to have had grown exponentially . 
  but , yeah , if you 're taking a charter flight directly to the cyclades or if you 're driving your estate skoda octavia directly to igoumenitsa , halkidiki or thassos you might not experience this as a tourist . 
   german/swedish/french / american manager visiting us next week ( he will buy a beer for everyone !, 
  ) , and yeah . 
  this is so accurate ... a friend of mine had his german manager visit his company in may , just as juventus was about to play against monaco in the cl semi-final ( said friend is a huge juve fan , as am i ) . 
  he had to `` entertain '' his german boss after work , cussing and swearing that he 's losing the game , but he finally convinced the german guy to come watch the second half of the match with him in the pub where all of us bucharest-based juve fans were drinking and shouting our lungs out . 
  the german guy seemed lost , like the woman anthropologist character in the [ taz cartoons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tasmanian_devil_%28looney_tunes%29 ) . 
  not a fun of kebab myself , but i 'd say that turkish cuisine is in many respects better than french and italian food . 
  it 's really , really hard to go wrong with any turkish-made food , while in both france and more recently italy i 've had huge hit-and-misses with my food . 
  a couple of months ago we dined in a pretty nice turin restaurant but the food was like what you 'd get in a hospital ( apparently it was a local specialty , did n't bother to remember its name ) . 
  i agree , some french and especially italian food can be out of this world , but i 'd say that turkish ( and middle-eastern ) cuisine is better over-all . 
  damn !!, 
  rip ... 
  yeah , in our case i think it 's also a matter of the local aromanians having a bigger pool from where to choose . 
  looking at my mother 's and brother 's skin color i can also say that i have gipsy blood through my veins ( i turned up white-er , after my dad ) . 
  you 're of course correct , people do n't talk that much about the gipsies that have managed to integrate , so much so that i 've recently started to believe more and more that `` being a gipsy '' is more a social thing/social construct and that it does n't have anything to do with skin color . 
  i mean , if i see you doing gipsy-like things then i 'll treat you like a gypsy , no matter what color your skin is . 
   there are not many of them in macedonia ( fewer than 10000 i think ) but they hold significant economic and political power the same as they do in romania . 
  one of our former billionaires ( i think he 's now `` only '' a millionaire ) and [ infamous football club owner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gigi_becali ) is of aromanian origins . 
  most of them have been re-settled in [ dobruja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobruja ) , and whenever i visit [ constanta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constan%c8%9ba ) i 'm surprised by how many expensive cars i see on the city 's streets ( it rivals bucharest in this regard ) . 
  also , they very rarely marry outside of their community , at least here , in romania . 
  a former ( woman ) friend of mine was in a relationship with an aromanian ( very nice guy ) , and when it came to them marrying there was a big no-no coming from the guy 's aromanian family because my friend was romanian ( they eventually split up ) . 
   this is a business not a social circus !, 
  then politicians like macron should not complain when eastern-european workers take the most sensible economic decision and decide to work in the west for less pay than the westerners but for a lot more than they 'd get at home . 
  lidl is paying its cashiers around 1700-2000 ron ( that 's 370 - 400 euros ) , and they 're genuinely seen as paying the highest salaries on this market ( article in romanian [ here ] ( http://www.zf.ro/companii/lidl-arunca-manusa-a-crescut-salariile-angajatilor-si-acum-angajeaza-500-de-persoane-ce-salariu-castiga-un-angajat-la-lidl-16173169 ) ) . 
  afaik auchan and the like pay about 1,000 - 1,200 ron , that 's 200-250 euros . 
  those latter salaries are a joke . 
   they are not paid french minimum wage . 
  they do n't respect french labor laws if the french hyper-market chains like carrefour , cora and auchan had paid decent salaries in the eastern european markets that they now dominate ( like romania ) and not expatriate back to france most of their profits then you 'd probably not see that many eastern european workers `` stealing '' the jobs from the the western european workers on their home turf . 
  i 'm really looking forward for macron to also talk about this issue , which he can directly influence ( by having a chit-chat with the french capitalists who control those hyper-market chains ) . 
  but i expect he wo n't . 
   i think the other slavic countries do n't use that name anymore though , can anyone confirm ? 
  people in wallachia and moldova used to call it tsarigrad , too , even though we 're not slavic ( ok , maybe we 're 30 % slavic , but we like to believe that we 're 50 % romans and 50 % dacians ) . 
  the reason is that the official language of the court documents was a form of slavonic . 
  the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visigoths#nomenclature:_vesi.2c_ostrogothi.2c_tervingi.2c_greuthungi ) gives a long explanation of the ostrogoth vs the visigoth nomenclature , but all i need to know is [ this image ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visigoths#/media/file:gutthiuda.jpg ) which rightly shows that both of those tribes started their conquest of europe from our beautiful romania ( which was not called romania back in the day , but it does n't matter , really ) . 
  which proves that whatever the visigoths and the ostrogoths got to conquer should be rightfully ours . 
  i think for the modern era napoleon wins it . 
  he was the guy that almost invented modern warfare ( and , like it or not , warfare is one of the main characteristics of the past 200 years ) , his civil code is practiced almost all over europe ( the same as the romans ' laws had survived well into the middle ages ) and he was also one of the first guys who actually tried to put a stop to the french revolution ( which in my opinion is the defining event of the modern era ) . 
  he managed to do it , for a while . 
   my closest lake town is nyon was called noviodunum and has an amphitheater and old walls and columns . 
  a town [ on the danube in romanian dobruja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noviodunum_%28castra%29 ) used to also be called noviodunum back in the roman times , and while looking for the wiki page i found out that there used to be [ several settlements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noviodunum ) called like that in those times , apparently noviodunum means `` new fort '' in celtic . 
  i always seem to forget how important the celts used to be for europe , they were spanning the entire continent before the romans did their thing . 
  there were lots of fake ads on olx when i was looking for a bucharest rental a couple of years ago . 
  after a while you learned to spot them , but it was still frustrating . 
  olx.ro is how i purchased my sh car , though , so they 're not entirely bad . 
   i talked to a friend today that said she was nervous , that her boyfriend ( and father of her newborn child ) was going to a concert . 
  i am going to a festival next weekend , and my mother was nervous . 
  i have a friend ( works in it , early 30s ) who said to his wife that there 's no way they 're going to a coldplay concert in hannover . 
  at first i thought that was because , well , he does n't like coldplay ( i 'm in that boat , too ) , but it turns out that he 's scared about any terror-related incidents that might happen while they 're attending the concert . 
  others have mentioned it , but i would n't put dostoyevsky and kafka on a list of * philosophers * . 
  they 're great writers ( i 'm a fan of them both ) , but their writings just seem to be more literary than philosophical ( not that 's anything wrong with that ) . 
  sartre has been over-valued for some time now ( even more so when you get older than 20 ) , kierkegaard answers a lot of your questions when you 're 17-18 ( at least , that 's how it worked for me ) but once you grow a little older and look for the answers to other , more important questions , you sort of move on from where he had left you . 
  i 'd say nietzsche and camus are still actual with their questions ( even though nietzsche 's god-thing quotation and thoughts are also way over-valued ) . 
  seems like an american-influenced list , or at least what americans would think when they hear about `` european philosophers '' . 
  auchan , of course . 
  this post might have just convinced me of going to catania/sicily this september . 
  i was torn between andalusia , portugal and sicily .
