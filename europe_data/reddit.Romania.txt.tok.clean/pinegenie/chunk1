ninja edit : i think the reason it 's priced more when you take a taxi without calling is because you also pay for the time the taxi spent waiting before you came , or something like that . 
  it 's not that , they 're just drivers that ask a way higher price than regular and hope people wo n't notice until it 's too late . 
  the chart shows the ** highest ** price . 
  average prices could be going down for all we know . 
  i think the cross would be on the right if hung upside down . 
  ah yes , the good old soviet anal vibrator harvesting collectives . 
  those were the times . 
  / u/virsinepolaris is right , here 's a nice [ video on the topic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=2lr7s1y6zig ) ( you can skip to 5:35 ) . 
   [ you can not simply have a referendum to secede . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h7d6z/romania_responds_coolly_to_hungarian_autonomy/ckq3od2 )  why not ? 
  secession and gaining autonomy are not the same thing . 
  you ca n't hold a secession referendum in romania unless you change the constitution . 
  translation :  article 1  ( 1 ) romania is a national , sovereign and independent , unitary and ** indivisible ** state . 
  a joke on romania . 
  to save that much yes , but / u/alteransg1 was saying that the amount of monkey you would get for 7-10 years of work in an eastern european country will be about 50 000 . 
  assuming you do n't spend a dime of it . 
  ever . 
  edit : monkey -  money, 
  i bet he was being sarcastic . 
  2 happened here as well , i forgot about it , 
  it 's slightly more complicated than that , there are several factors i think people overlook . 
  * almost all rural residents own their home and there 's a lot of them . 
  * the communist regime made of point of providing everyone with a home ( even if it was a small shitty apartment ) . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how this worked , someone can shed more light . 
  * population mobility is fairly low , so most of tenants are very young or students . 
  i 'm sure all of those points are debatable . 
  the witch is dead !, 
  i doubt it . 
  a romanian joke about hungarians : two hungarians , arpad and laci , want to gain romanian citizenship , they go to the embassy and are told they have to swim across the river olt . 
  they drive to the river but they get cold feet . 
  arpad : why do n't you go first and tell me what the water 's like ? 
  laci : ok . laci swims to the other sides , gets out of the water and begins to dry himself off . 
  arapd yelling : how 's the water ? 
  laci yelling back : fuck off , you filthy hungarian !, 
  people were asked what their views are towards the country of serbia , not it 's people . 
  people could have answered unfavorably due to serbia not being one of the `` rich '' countries , or for having corruption . 
  what i 'm saying is that people may have voted negatively because serbia is too much like romania . 
  it was a really big surprised when i found out i could understand italian in chat . 
  i once had a conversation with an italian , each of us writing in our own native languages . 
  i 'd say goulash , but that would be cheating because we also have it over here . 
  muah ha ha ha haha !, 
  3 a triangle has 3 faces conclusion : [ illuminati ] ( http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/pulse/illuminatieye.jpg ), 
  i 'm having a hard time accepting that their training does n't include spotting the difference between a mobile phone and a bomb . 
  do n't they have to pass all electronics through the x-ray scanner ? 
  ca n't they tell if a phone is actually a phone from there ? 
  the falklands , adolfo bioy casares , llamas and beautiful women . 
  do you honestly think we can have any noticeable exports doing this ? 
  i do n't care . 
  that 's how you 're supposed to write titles in english . 
  i thought it was dr. who too :p, 
  but are n't most of those women accountants ? 
  that 's the case in romania , though not listed in this report . 
  you 're not a nuisance , man . 
  enjoy your stay !, 
  that inspector 's name is quite fitting : `` lupu '' means `` the wolf '' . 
  according to your own source , [ both ireland and romania have higher gdp growth than poland ] ( http://www.gridvisual.com/datasets/gdp-and-main-components-volumes-eurostat-namq_gdp_k?s=b87c6c64101dd2c9ebe7ab977799cf7c ) . 
  well , for starters we say `` th '' sounds like a d or z or t , whichever suits . 
  we do n't have `` th '' sounds in romanian . 
  maybe mr. farage just does n't like our accents . 
  just out of curiosity , what does `` i 'm after doing it ! '', 
  mean ? 
  how the hell does anyone trust this ? 
  i can make an app show you anything i want it to show you . 
  thank god , now we just have to do something to stop those pedophiles !, 
  begging has been illegal in romania for quite some time now . 
  there are lots of people that hate others in this world , but i believe most do n't hate anyone . 
  ah , so what you 're saying is that people regret romania and bulgaria joining too soon ? 
  when exactly did the eu start regretting romania joining ? 
  well , romania stands out . 
  why is portugal vilnius ? 
  the best way to get more votes is to give the right to vote to the disenfranchised and exploited dolphin minority !, 
  you 'll earn much more in denmark than in romania , so if your definition of `` good salary '' is what you 'd make in copenhagen then yes , you wo n't find it in romania . 
  a alinta a ( as in ** aa ** rdvark ) a ( ** aa ** rdvark ) - lin ( like in ** lin ** t ) - ta ( as in ** ta ** r ) it means to make a gesture of endearment . 
  like a lover lazily playing with your hair , or someone rocking a baby to sleep in their arms . 
  ah , green is used over here , i just assumed they were the same . 
  the colors on almost all traffic signs were chose to conform with [ heraldic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heraldry ) principles , which had the goal of making coats of arms easier to distinguish . 
  one of the base rules of heraldry is that tinctures ( solid colors like blue , green purple ) ca n't touch each other , neither can metals ( white and gold ) . 
  regular toponym signs are white ( silver ) or blue ( azure ) , highway signs are white on green ( vert ) . 
  who the hell would downvote this ? 
  edit : a word . 
  that 's because we 'll need all that industry to support the mass exodus to the uk . 
  side note : are romania/uk jokes dead yet ? 
  i 'm ashamed to even be on the same planet . 
  and romanian . 
  ( c\u0103\u021bel = dog , c\u0103\u021belu\u0219 = small dog or puppy ), 
  they know ... 
  i was in denmark a few years ago and noticed that they write `` spa watter '' on some brands of bottled water . 
  `` spa '' apparently is `` kur '' and the word for spa watter ends up being `` kurvand '' . 
  in romanian that means to whore . 
  alternatively you can just interpret the `` kur '' as being `` ass '' =  ass water . 
  that makes absolutely no sense . 
  if 4-8 % of hungary 's 10 million people are roma , that means they have 400k-800k roma . 
  if 8-12 % of romania 's population of 20 million are roma , that means 1.6m-2 .4 m. 
  meaning that / u/criticalstories pulled that statistic out of his ass . 
  if you take wikipedia 's statistics about the two countries , which are actually sourced : romania has 20m population and 3.3 % are roma hungary has 10m population and 3.1 % are roma not only does romania has double the number of roma , but the percentage of the population they represent is greater . 
   i fly up to hundreds of times a year . 
  next time you are in a major european airport . 
  i 'll pm you , you 'll most likely be there  ), 
   in munich t2 , level 4 ( g gates ) is for schengen flights and level 5 ( h gates ) is for non-schengen flights . 
  right , and everyone going to t2 goes through the same checking , screening and has access to the same shops and bathroom facilities .
