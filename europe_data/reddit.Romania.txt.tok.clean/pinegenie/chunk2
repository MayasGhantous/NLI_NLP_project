  this is what you originally stated :  passengers arriving and departing on flights to/from non-schengen countries use different gates , security screening facilities , and once airside , shops , restaurants , lounges , and toilets from those who are going to/from schengen countries . 
  it is not true , at most the airport uses different gates for schengen/non-schengen . 
  i 've traveled from romania ( non-schengen ) to lithuania , denmark and germany ( all schengen ) , i 've had connecting flights in riga , vienna and munchen . 
  there was never an area of the airport exclusive to schengen travelers , there were however two sets of specialized border booths for people from the eu , eeu and schengen ( all bundled up into one ) and the rest . 
  all travelers that disembark the plane will go through the same area , pass through their respective border booths and end up in a shared area . 
  eu , eeu , schengen , non-european ... everyone . 
  it may be different in other airports , but the ones in romania , vienna , munchen , vilnius , copenhagen and riga all have this system . 
  i 've flown a couple of times and have never seen that . 
  of course . 
  i do n't really care , the other eu countries can have their voter bait as far as i 'm concerned . 
   firefox has better javascript stack traces hmm ... what framework is that ? 
  what equality did romans promote exactly ? 
  i 'm certainly no scholar , but i seem to remember that romans used slave labor and had a very unfair system of citizenship . 
  education was non-existent for most people and the status they could achieved in society was closely tied to the social strata they were born in . 
  labor costs are influenced by government policies , not set . 
  minimum wage , which is different to labor costs , are set by the markets . 
   some of you may love equality and liberty , and some of you may love honesty and justice . 
  all of these ideas were championed by the romans at some point . 
  i think you 're romanticizing , a lot . 
  i understand you like roman history , but i think you 're just looking for ways to support your ideas by nitpicking certain bits of history . 
  i would replace `` rome '' with `` humanity '' in your quote , i find it a worthier `` god '' . 
  you also think of rome as a united people spanning across the continent . 
  even if that were true , ask yourself this : how many roman workers traveled the way we do now ? 
  how many carpenters from hispania went to see the alps ? 
  how many people had friends from other provinces ? 
  how many people had business or learned from others on the other side of the continent ? 
  in most ways , we are much more united than rome could ever have hoped to be . 
  no no no , you 're totally right . 
  firefox used to have e reputation for bad memory , not anymore . 
  side note : i 'm also a web developer and use chrome for work and ff as a personal browser , 
  i really was n't expecting to read that . 
  a couple of years ago people were still complaining about memory leaks , they 've been fixed a long time ago but some people just love to complain . 
  they have a disproportionate amount of [ satellites in orbit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_satellites_in_geosynchronous_orbit#number_of_satellites_per_country_of_origin ) . 
  if you live in romania the first third of your contact list is people who 's names begin with an a. 
  no , you lied . 
   divorce by 14 lolwhut ? 
  i 'd really like to know where gypsies get divorced , over here they just have lots of mistresses , if they can . 
  but never divorce . 
  wait , wait wait !, 
  some please clear something up for me . 
  we can all still get into france by presenting a id card at a schengen border . 
  so who does not allowing us into the schengen area stop ? 
  i do n't thinks there 's a consensus in romania about it , but here 's what me and my friends really like : silva and silva black , timi\u0219oreana , trei stejari, 
  i 'm guessing this is skewed a lot by high abortion rates immediately after the falling of the iron curtain . 
  i 'm curious on how you compiled this data . 
  i 've only checked romania , because the figures seem extremely off . 
  here 's what the [ source says ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/romania/ab-romaniac.html ) . 
  also see [ this ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/#ro ) . 
  now , if you want to lump data from 1970 together with data from 2010 , you should state this . 
  for comparison , in ** 2010 ** there were ** 101,915 ** reported abortions and ** 212,199 ** live births . 
  we have no indication of the number of miscarriages or stillborn , but if we divide the number of abortions by the crude approximation of number of pregnancies ( abortions + live births ) we get ~ ** 32.45 % ** . 
  i would really appreciate an updated map . 
  it really is n't , i 've seen lost of people go , smart and dumb . 
  just apply and have a great time !, 
  half of romania 's pie chart looks like the romanian flag . 
  iceland looks like the peace sign . 
  relevance , you ask ? 
  none . 
  neither is swedish , chinese and arab . 
  i was joking of course . 
  i 'm in the middle of reading `` guns , germs and steel '' which goes into great detail on the geographic and ecological circumstances that allowed europe and asia to become such great powers . 
  it 's a great book , i recommend it . 
  it 's actually romance languages , obviously . 
  stuff like italian , german , swedish , chinese , arab . 
   lulz http://translate.google.com/#nl/en/lul, 
  i see a lot of fellow romanians in here taking this as proof that we 're not racist . 
  if gypsies cause problems somewhere else it means that they do indeed cause problems . 
  it does not make us any more or any less racist than we already were . 
  and we are . 
  the self-entitled emperor of the gypsies recently passed away . 
  or maybe they 'll send their children to steal and beg more , since it 's probably much more profitable than welfare . 
  i agree with you that not valuing education has become ingrained in their culture . 
  but i think the way to change that is to make education more productive than stealing , begging and having children for welfare . 
  better access to education is a must for this , but in many cases that is n't a big issue , at least not compared to social immobility . 
  if you want them to value education , you have to make it reasonable for them reach a decent social status through it , which due to racism is hard . 
  it 's all a circle really . 
  it varies a lot , does n't it . 
  when i was younger we had a couple of gypsies renting a room from us , and a few gypsy neighbors . 
  we never had problems with them . 
  but not all of them are like that , sadly . 
  what 's also sad is that only the bad ones get any attention . 
  and that 's why i do n't give money to beggars . 
  i 've seen children get money from begging only to be driven home in their parent 's mercedes . 
  if you want to help people out , donate to a charity , doctors without borders are incredible . 
  that has n't worked well for the last couple of hundred years . 
  the reason threads end up a mess is because it 's a complex problem , with no evident solution . 
  `` a se \u021big\u0103ni '' is used around here often . 
  it means to cause commotion with the aim to get a better deal , kind of like overly aggressive bartering . 
  sorry m8 , the only one i remember was the one you replied to earlier . 
  i 'm not good at remembering jokes . 
  i always ask my hungarian friends for romanian jokes , some of them are really good , 
  two hungarians want gain romanian citizenship . 
  they are informed they must first swim across the olt river . 
  they get to the river and decide to take turns crossing it , and the first one starts swimming . 
  upon reaching the other shore , his friend asks him how the water is , and he responds : `` suck my c ** k , stinking hungarian !, 
  i 'll just assume that comment about hungarians was a joke . 
  sibiu : h [ ermann oberth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_oberth ) - one of the fathers of rocketry . 
  tri\u0219ezi !, 
  ah , i completely agree with you here . 
  would you elaborate on this please ?
