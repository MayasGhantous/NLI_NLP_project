yeah , but we ( former eastern bloc ) are not the ones complaining . 
  it 's kind of annoying to hear greeks and spaniards complain so much . 
  they think they have it rough ? 
  sorry but that shit is frightening, 
  around 20 % of romanian words are from old church slavonic or other slavic languages . 
  the percentage used to be even more . 
  \u0219unc\u0103 , colac , oblon , uli\u021b\u0103 , m\u0103celar ( same meaning for all ) edit : m\u0103celar might be forced , seems to be from latin actually ( macellarius ) . 
  perhaps all of them got it from there ? 
  there were more in use before 19th century . 
  as romanians modernized , areas such as technology and administration , cultural and city life borrowed heavily from french ( and italian to a lesser extent ) . 
  you can still get a glimpse of the more slavic intensive vocabulary by speaking with elder people in rural areas . 
  they would say `` n\u0103dejde '' in place of `` speran\u021b\u0103 '' ( hope ) , `` v\u0103zduh '' in place of `` cer '' ( sky ) , `` uli\u021b\u0103 '' in place of `` strad\u0103 '' ( street ) etc. 
  macedonians refer to greece as fopoy ( former ottoman province of yunanistan ) in youtube comments . 
  \\ #justbalkanthings, 
  actually more like these : http://goo.gl/maps/wupzv http://goo.gl/maps/a1lmq http://goo.gl/maps/m7ntl generally poor , but not on the level posted by op , just boring . 
  if you cross the border into bulgaria/serbia/ukraine , you wo n't even be able to spot the difference . 
  that humble brag only a nordic can sneak in . . ( if i were to generalize as you did ) . 
  yes , the gap is big , but you 'd be a fool to paint the whole country with the brush of this extremely unfortunate place . 
  vast majority of villages are typical to the surrounding area ( bulgaria , ukraine , serbia ) . 
  not to mention there 's a big divorce between rural and urban life . 
  speaking of good ol' usa and extreme poverty , have you seen the rundown crack houses in baltimore or detroit ? 
  yeah , ok . now go to some us poverty threads and sigh at the gap between northern europe and those areas all you want . 
  i 'm sure they 'll find your input as the peak of human empathy . 
  dude , when macedonians refer to greece as fopoy ( former ottoman province of yunanistan ) , it puts a wide smile on my face that lasts for hours . . it 's almost like getting high !,

  at this rate they 'll eventually speak full blown french by 5000 ad, 
  wish i could amuse myself at this , but we 're no better . 
  romania - hungary saw a lot of provocations between fans on both sides , different groups of romanian supporters even started fighting each other , finally the private security beating the piss out of everyone . 
  it was all pretty absurd . 
  football fandom is for manchildren . 
  nah bro , now they can go to london as well . 
  u mad ?

  this video should be mandatory to all those sheltered commie sympathizers , glorifying communism without living a single day under it .

  the fuck ? 
  i remember the kind of food similar with what the op posted , but . . yeah , not difficult to imagine the `` food '' served in poor hospitals ( especially in the countryside ) is this horrible . 
  jeez . .

  there 's this technology called 3g or 4g , you know . . 
  not the best example for moldova , since it 's boiled maize flour ( not really a pastry ) . 
  cozonac is common for romania & moldova ( perhaps other countries ) https://www.google.com/search?q=cozonac&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x, 
  that is breathtaking,

  ouch , what a burn . . 
  this tram looks ravishing . 
  would ask it out for dinner, 
  meh , i like the color scheme on the old ones better, 
  judging by the size of the poop it was definitely our cheeky european mascot !,

  12 years of no dubbing and no subtitles on cable/satellite television did wonders here . 
  montenegro has a nice anthem : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gptpjmdtofk would fit well with a bossfight in a castlevania/darksiders themed game :d, 
  russia never learned how to be a soft power and what the advantages are . 
  you should google this thing called google . . 
  do n't mistake bucharest for budapest in front of your audience .

  would n't it be terribly ironic if kaliningrad would be overrun by ukrainians claiming it their own ?

  more competition is always welcome . 
  negativism , yes . . idiotic ? 
  hardly . 
  i know a lot of people who had to pay extra to get a room . 
  not to mention the rooms might 've been renovated by the students with their own money . 
  this also happens . 
  is that pricing bribe-free ? 
   do n't you like other ` slavs ' , like bulgars and serbs ? 
  it 's not that we do n't like them . 
  it 's more about trying to emphasize our `` latin heritage '' and western connections , while sweeping a lot of slavic influence under the rug . 
  but it 's pretty ridiculous , when a lot of common names for people and places are obviously slavic , also a significant part of our vocabulary ( which used to be even more significant in pre-modernity ) . 
  that 's a relief for many around here . 
  we 're more slavic than we 'd like to admit . 
  russian federation of europe , at least we 'll have gas . . 
  glorious . 
  got teary eyed from laughter, 
   she 's not swedish , that is as ridiculous as saying a white person in the united states is a native american . 
  you can try and redefine terms all you like but a dog born in a barn wo n't say nay . 
  analogies that make zero sense . 
  you sound like just another white nationalist . 
  selling back what some of us `` borrowed '' , huehue ? 
  a proper source for that swedish study : https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/32711/1/gupea_2077_32711_1.pdf ( 2011 ), 
  that opens a whole different can of confusion :d, 
  no , that 's pretty tame compared to something like this ( transcript in comments ) http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23cpgm/v_zhirinovsky_goes_on_fullrampage_mode/, 
  haha , great parody :d, 
   furthermore as time goes by english will also undergo internal changes - just look how the information age influenced the english language . 
  so the likely language that will rule the world in a century or two will not be english , but a language that once upon a time was english but undergone such a lengthy process of development that it is a language in its own right . 
  i agree with the vocabulary enrichment part , but i ca n't wrap my head around this considering languages are less volatile now with standardized forms , ubiquitous written records and literacy rates  95 %,
