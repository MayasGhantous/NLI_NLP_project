  i like this one too from last year : [ aliona moon - o mie ( live ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xckgluv73jc ), 
  oh , my bad  sarcasm  internet pick one : <, 
  it may sound odd , but i do n't think it was from what i can remember . 
  sure it sucked , but life was harsh and you had to deal with it in a `` less is more '' kind of way . 
  for example : * arriving first in front of a queue for bread/milk was like a small victory * buying some jeans from the black market and wearing them with pride for many many years * bananas and oranges were luxury goods , it was a lifetime event for a kid to have them , as if they came from a fairytale land pooped by golden unicorns nowdays , the availability & choice of goods is overwhelming and depressingly meaningless ( paradox of choice ) . 
  i hardly get impressed by anything ( that i can afford ) . 
  one of the fastest places in the world ( [ suplacu de barcau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suplacu_de_barc%c4%83u ) ) by average internet speed ( [ 156 mbps ] ( http://www.netindex.com/download/4,233820/suplacu-de-barcau/?tab=3 ) ) is the absolute definition of `` nowhere '' that 's not an exceptional case . . a lot of communes/small towns are included in the [ top fastest places in romania ] ( http://www.netindex.com/download/2,9/romania/#city_rank ) ( with big cities ranking less , like timisoara # 12 , bucharest # 17 , cluj # 30 , constanta # 47 etc. ), 
  poverty - yes , lack of broadband penetration - no, 
  people confuse `` equal opportunity between genders '' with the ridiculous notion of gender equality per se, 
   i lived in poland for 6 months in a small town in the south and the most offensive thing that was said to me by a `` family friend '' was that i was `` too white to be romanian '' . 
  haha , i 've heard about this type of remark before, 
  let 's not ignore someone who 's `` vice-chairman of the state duma '' he 's not running the show , but maybe he 's representative in how the russian officials carry themselves ? 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  did he call them lesbians at the end ? 
  thanks , i did n't know that . 
  yes , post this 5 more times . 
  i 'm sure it 'll become true . 
  `` nah guys , he 's just kidding . . provcation as in challenge , right ? '', 
  / s  question : ** no , this is an urgent issue for all of us , not a provocation . 
  ** i 'm glad the villager reinforced it as `` not a provocation '' . 
  it denies the respin of it as a `` challenge '' . 
  ps : everything ashimpto posts is entirely and blindly pro-russian, 
  was n't paris planning to limit car traffic by odd or even plate numbers to combat air pollution ? 
  yeah , look at those warmongering nordics / s, 
   my family is in moldova and these days most of the youths there do n't speak russian that well which youths ? 
  ethnic russians ? 
  pshh . . louisiana is simple , like most outer us states . 
  the central/landlocked ones are annoying though . 
  what about * superficiel * ? 
  ( superficial in romanian ), 
  also . . dracula alive numbr one # 1 in rom\u00e2nia , dracula making fast rap album of rom\u00e2nia !, 
  their take on romania & bulgaria was pretty funny we 're safe . . for now :d, 
  glory to arstotzka !, 
  but they 're outdoors all day . . ( are there so many ? 
  whoa ), 
  you ai n't from ` round here , now are you boy ? 
  * pumps shotgun *, 
  but romania fails by itself to absorb eu funds due to corruption . 
  there 's no guarantee moldova will benefit in a timely manner from the eu if they 'd join us . 
  facepalm . 
  `` you '' this , `` you '' that . 
  you who ? 
  you 're holding grudges with contemporary people that had nothing to do with what you 're babbling about . 
  grow up !, 
  it was nice that it was placed along with empty shelves . . so much nostalgia to absorb in one go now i go to the supermarket and there 's a whole section for a million types of bread . 
  ai n't got no time for your tricks . 
  why not be just sinmply bread ?? 
  much choise , very indecision, 
   moldova how ? 
  there 's only 6 % russians in republic of moldova ( proper , without transnistria ), 
  you 're ignoring how nato and american influence was creeping on russians from all sides . 
  they 'd be absolute fools to let ukraine go , at least part of it . 
  you have the impression that the russians have the upper hand now , they 're not even half-way there . 
  romanian has asymmetrical intelligibility with the rest of the romance languages ( we understand more from them , than they do understand us ) . 
  however you 'd be surprised how quickly it 's picked up by italians/portuguese , judging by the interviews with portuguese/italian football players that are active in our league . 
  it 's funny to hear them speak with a very mixed vocabulary ( ex : italo-romanian ) and you understand everything they say . 
  you 're just jealous of his tinfoil hat, 
  bootleg cartoons were dubbed in such a manner that you could still hear the english in the background . 
  i was pissed off as a kid , since the english voices were a lot better ( duh ) than this single-person dubbing . 
  picked up a lot of english words this way however . 
  flashbacks to that awesome animated clip back in the 00 's : '' . . but i 'm le tired '', 
  the new arrivals effect `` we 're coming rougher every time '' :d, 
  this is how every french class in highschool started :d, 
  they were poor regardless , let 's not blame it on foreign investors, 
  facepalm , playing right into the `` but cluj !! '', 
  stereotype, 
  we had no business taking extra clay, 
  crossing the nistru/dniepr in ww2 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:rom1942.png, 
  unless you are a clock . 
  ( i apologize for dissing your clocks ), 
  ca n't believe you typed that , let alone believe that nk and russia are comparable in your view, 
  did n't know spain has so many mountains , it was pretty hilly and arid in my head . . whoa : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/sotrespanorama.jpg, 
  futsal ( indoor soccer ) is the best , yo !, 
  it 's football with scoring :d http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrkbd8fmhv8, 
  same way as youtube comments . . we 're getting there, 
   tellurium discovered by franz-joseph m\u00fcller freiherr von reichenstein welp , not really . . 
  sri ( internal affairs secret service ) , sie ( external affairs secret service ) , sts ( special telecomunications service ) , dgipi ( police secret service ) + some other 3 apparently, 
   spell words closer to how they are pronounced today pronounced according to which dialect/regional accent ? 
  fixing the spelling of english is impossible without alienating a lot of its speakers . 
  those are n't even regionalisms , i understand all those sets of words and i 'm not a native speaker from ohio , lol . 
  what 's a semi-turk ? 
  not so fast . 
  we 're not done yet . 
  [ kaleidonescu - upperfields ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpjbeslpji ) [ the thirteenth sun - comprehension ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zujtacpkfq ), 
  that 's the map of the developing world : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/2/2e/20140105125517!developing_countries_map.png which is a very broad classification . 
   guy sounds like he 's full of shit or has a major chip on his shoulder . 
  i would n't be surprised if he 's a guy from stormfront trying to give romanians a bad name . 
  he is n't , just a drama queen . 
  luxembourg is just a region too . 
  volga germans . 
  german settlers from the times of catherine ii the great ( she was german too and encouraged them ) . 
  macedonians did n't exist back then ? 
  also note that the map shows population majorities , some areas were a lot more mixed . 
  those bills look like foodstamps, 
  til belarus is not part in the council of europe, 
  god forbid russians post more positive/non-shitty stuff about their country , they upset the balance !, 
  the present territory of romania was incorporated into the roman empire and as a consequence we speak a romance language . 
  also our ethnonyms ( `` romani '' / `` vlahi '' - romanians , wallachians ) mean `` romans '' or `` romance speaking people '' . 
  along the way , we got a lot of slavic influences through admixture with the slavic migrators/neighbors/settlers , old slavonic got a foothold as the language of the church and romanian itself was written in cyrillics until 1860 . a lot of our toponyms and names are slavic in origin , also modern romanian vocabulary has 15-20 % of its words with slavic origin . 
  during our national awakening from the 19th century , we rallied around our `` latinity '' to help us in our aspirations towards the west .
