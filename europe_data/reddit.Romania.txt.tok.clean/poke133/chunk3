  we also wanted a strong identity to bind the union of our 2 historical kingdoms ( wallachia & moldova ) and get recognition from the western powers , especially the french . 
  things went full retard during ceausescu 's regime , when history was presented in such a way that we were the direct successors of the romans and dacians , downplaying all of our other infuences ( mainly slavic and ottoman ) . 
  this served the purpose in creating a national myth of romanian exceptionalism and noble origins . 
  a lot of people grew up with that version of history and can get very defensive or be in denial when presented with the obvious contradictions , especially when it comes to language . 
  romanian language has a similar history as english up to a point . 
  english started as a west germanic language , then came the norman french influence . 
  romanian started as a local variant of vulgar latin , then came the slavonic influence . 
  however later on , as our country stepped into modernity we relatinized our language through heavy borrowing from french and italian ( ranging from science/technological inovation , administration to fashion and city life ) and a part of slavic words fell into disuse or become archaic ( outdated customs , technology and social systems ) . 
  most people do n't know this and coupled with the carefully cosmetized history taught in schools , they assume we are more latin than we really are and more connected to the west than with our neighbors . 
  even more after we went full retard with the `` we are latin master race ! '', 
  mantra during our national awakening & after the brainwashing of ceausescu 's nationalistic flavored communism . 
  this resulted in a very awkward inferiority complex towards the west and a superiority complex with our neighbors ( especially slavs , with which we have more in common than we 'd like to admit ) . 
  did n't know romanians and bulgarians are such a threat to british culture ( being european themselves anyway ) . . meanwhile sharia zones, 
  welp , luckily britain was n't populated by anglo-saxons back then . 
  are you holding a grudge in place for the celts and picts ? 
  mongols are cheating since they invade from the east :p, 
  we 'd share transylvania, 
  ten times worse on mobile . 
  dancing clay, 
  not accurate . 
  romania should be `` m\u044a\u043c\u044a\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043a\u044f '', 
  yes , i 'll recall my very own 5 gypsies . 
  they 'll show up any minute now . . ... oops !, 
  sorry mate , but i fudged up the gypsy assembly incantation . 
  they 've multiplied by a factor of 2 now . . again , sorry !, 
  honest mistake !, 
  is n't iskander a turkish name ? 
  just curious, 
  italian intonation sounds like people argue or are being reproachful all the time . 
  hungarian sounds like kids mocking each other with made up words that rhyme . 
  bulgarian sounds morose and naive . 
  swedish sounds very loveless & unsettling . 
  finnish sounds like something dr.strange from marvel comics would chant before doing some funky spells . 
  ps : please do n't be offended , this is just a shallow perception bonus : romanian sounds like a hobo schizophrenic version of vulgar latin . 
  `` when a language dies , a way of understanding the world dies with it . '', 
  would you trust a bank like dacia felix to handle your money ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  anyway neac\u0219u 's letter , apart from the slavonic phrases ( first , last sentence and the repeatinig `` i pak '' ) is very intelligible to a modern romanian speaker . 
  fta  as opposed to the first documents of other languages , which are in general more ancient , the romanian language used in this letter is very similar to the language spoken nowadays . 
  whoa !, 
  judging from lord 's prayer ( lu patri nostru ) , i see it 's a bit more similar to romanian than italian is . 
  mainly because it kept the u 's instead of replacing them with o 's all the time . 
  because it 's not serving a single person/political force . 
  how different is ukrainian compared to russian ? 
  can you give me a simple example is the difference bigger than between czech and slovak ? 
  not only did you lose transylvania ( and other regions ) in the face of [ demographic realities of the time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:austria_hungary_ethnic.svg ) , but you also lost it in a war : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian-romanian_war_of_1919 so the correct word would be `` lost '' , not `` stolen '' . 
  can we move on now ? 
  it 's ok , you can visit or even move here . 
  there 's this thing called eu that we should be concerned on consolidating , because without it we 're pretty fucking irelevant anyway when faced with usa , china , russia etc. 
  and we 'd both be right . 
  muslim is not an ethnicity, 
  you can tell 1 gbit rolled out ( and more importantly people can afford it ) : http://www.netindex.com/download/allcountries/ we 're overtaking south korea and japan , and we 're only behind hong kong & singapore ( city-states basically ) :d, 
  dat photo . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
   just like it mostly has with romania and bulgaria http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cosem2evkdc, 
  horrible : / how can you fight over a town and level it up at the same time ? 
  aka no industry left standing , 
  after seeing the title , i read your username as `` deep breath '', 
  tbh kurds are more entitled to their own country , than turkish cypriots, 
  the anti-corruption agency was/is a pollitical tool for the current president . 
  so when you 're convicting people on a very thin basis ( politically motivated ) , no wonder you get reactions like that from the public because it lacks credibility . 
  now bracing for downvotes from the people who think i support either side of the political circus . 
  you get what you deserve , 
  in romanian , the colloquial version is `` io '' . 
  apart from some throaty consonants ( h ? ), 
  that no one forces you to match like a native speaker , dutch intonation sounds quite cool . 
  lovely song btw . 
  set phasers to hate !, 
  not that this is n't a dick move , but i guess even our ass-kissing europhile pollitical class got tired of being the doormat of the eu . 
  this is pretty uncharacteristic of them . 
  maybe they want to test the waters first ? 
  right ? 
  my cyrillics are getting sharper, 
   enjoy your day in that polluted shithole you call a country . 
  we usually do , unless we see that horse faced prince of yours hanging around . . cause he sure loves spending time here atop of the garbage heap . 
  roma gypsies are originally from india and they 're usually brown ( very brown when not mixed ) . 
  there are rare exceptions though of lightskinned roma with blue/or blonde hair ( personally i have n't seen any with both ) , but i would n't blame anyone for being suspicious, 
  welp  in varietate concordia i would n't push rome as a civilizational identity to the nordics for example . . ( although it 's a bit ironic that motto is in latin :d ), 
  this is about current politicians . 
  welp , we have the snow , but not the nordic expertise to clear it such is life, 
  you can since 2009 or so . 
  not that was really enforced before that, 
  human capital is very important for a nation claiming to be a world power , especially one with such a vast area and rich in natural resources . 
  your comment is totally off the mark . 
  finn complaining about snow ? 
  not a good look . . 
  or maybe more of the poor parts of india flavor : http://goo.gl/maps/jkxhn, 
  worse how ? 
  do n't hold back :d, 
  these pictures are in the more presentable parts of the city . 
  greenery is scarce in your typical communist neighborhoods where grey and beige concrete reign supreme : http://media.rtv.net/image/201203/full/blocuri_case_bucuresti_imobiliare__09494900.jpg, 
  i have the same ethernet cable coming into my appartment since late 2004 . i changed isp 3 times . 
  they just plugged the cable into their own switch on the first floor . 
  also 100 mbits was widely available in cities since 2005, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm the second guy . 
  what 's with the polish comments ? 
  please do n't tell me that 's a big hit over there :d, 
  they should 've filmed in naples ^ * shots ^ fired *, 
  bears , wolves and stuff,
