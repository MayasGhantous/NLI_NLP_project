  burst into laughter at `` perimeter from russia '' . 
  will russians as a state ever be likeable ? 
  not only college , after a mandatory period of 7 years of medical residency ( with even shittier pay ) . . then you become a full doctor . 
  true . 
  france/italy/spain are prime destinations . 
  although italy and spain are a bit `` saturated '' . 
  fucking uncle jack and his opie headed nephew, 
  what 's this ? 
  tl ; dr whatevs , serbians our bros. go ahead and publish !, 
  later : ** why you little . . **, 
  nah , houses in cities were demolished and people were moved into communist flats . 
  most abandoned their dogs because it 's tough to raise them in a small appartment . 
  are catalans really that different of an ethnic group or is this just a regionalistic movement ? 
  wikipedia lists them under spanish people . 
  here this independence movement seems pretty weird , having chased the union of all romanians for a long time ( on basis of language more than anything ) . 
  even the serbian/croat/bosnian division seems weird to us . 
  [ papers , please ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/ ), 
  you forget one very important angle : if assad falls and syria steps outside of russia 's sphere of influence , there 's a big possibility the gas pipeline project from qatar to syria will relieve europe 's gas problems with russian monopoly . 
  that would be unacceptable for russians . 
  they 're part of the problem still . 
  i 'm sure they underperform to have something to occupy themselves with, 
  god save us from russians and their misunderstood good intentions . . 
  800 - finnish , malayalam , nepali finnish was coupled with estonian . 
  like that 's fair !, 
  i knew from some fins that estonian sounds funny and it sounded funny enough for me to pick it and fail : <, 
  why the downvotes ? 
  the poor script conveys this message more than anything . 
  the factories with human workers were worse than today ( not even with a basic production line and current levels of automation ) . . and they had freakin ' super advanced biped robots !!, 
  totally believable . 
  you paid mney for what ? 
  ( alt ) prtscrn , ctrl+v directly in imgur ( i 'm sure you can crop the image there too ), 
  inglorious mediterranean bandwidth-impaired race ( a personal theory of mine . . since italy , spain , greece etc. 
  seem to have poorer internet than the rest of eu . 
  brings a bit of compensation to all those splendid sunny beaches and myriad of beautiful islands in the middle of crystal clear waters . 
  can we trade ? ), 
  good stuff . 
  at least it was a war between opposing forces here 's the most ridiculous battle that i know of : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar%c3%a1nsebes, 
  tito did nothing wrong . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ribbentrop-molotov.svg soviet soldiers were used in those landgrabs as well . . 
  that is absolutely fantastic !, 
  i do n't like one upmanship . 
  besides the video is kind of cringey, 
  really ? 
  even after the tito-stalin split ? 
  also considering tito       stalin ? 
   but in the end it 's not very meaningful . 
  are you sure ? 
  yay , moar peasants on my internet / s, 
   other than that eu offers superior living standards and quality of life . 
  it does n't ? 
  at the end it shows how in bulgaria nodding your head means no and shaking your head ( side to side ) means yes that 's such a mindfuck :d anyway , the rest of the video applies to romania as well . 
   maybe there should be a bill send towards romania for all the material and lives lost trying to defend their country after the soviets pushed back ? 
  that bill was more than paid after the soviet army crossed into romania and pillaged their way through with a little bonus of installing a stalinist puppet regime + the heavy losses incurred fighting against the axis in the campaign that followed . 
  not to mention after the war , the soviets drained our resources via [ sovroms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom ) , while you guys in the west enjoyed the marshall plan . 
  from the article :  in theory , sovroms were joint romanian-soviet ventures aimed at generating revenue for reconstruction , [ 1 ] and were created on a half-share basis in respect to the two states ; [ 2 ] however , they were mainly designed as a means to ensure resources for the soviet side , and generally contributed to draining romania 's resources ( in addition to the war reparations demanded by the armistice convention of 1944 and the paris peace treaties = = = = = = = = = = =  and i am sure they can include some minor fine for backstabbing their ally as soon as the russians got too close , must have violated some treaties there . 
  that was n't `` backstabbing '' , it was smartly playing out a shit hand of cards after ribbentrop-molotov 's annexations of half our by country by both the axis powers ( transylvania ) and the soviet union ( bessarabia/moldova ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ribbentrop-molotov.svg the only people that could rightfully claim something from romania would be the jews and other victims of the holocaust we were directly responsable for . 
  hmm , that looks like `` salam de sibiu '' as we call it . 
  it is absolutely delicious, 
  was n't there a saying `` god save me from serb heroism and croatian culture '' ? 
  that battle of covadonga article is not right when it comes to strength estimates :  strength  300 [ 1 ] 800 - 1,400 ( modern estimates )  187,000 ( medieval estimates )  casualties and losses  289 dead [ 1 ] 124,000 killed ( medieval estimates ), 
  music lyrics also helped a lot in expanding my vocabulary . 
  unless you listen to top40 crap which is repetitive in themes and with limited word diversity . 
  driverless cars will most likely start to be used on motorways where there are less variables . 
  this is being done one step at a time , you wo n't wake up with full blown autonomous cars all of a sudden . 
  so it 's no need for you to be so snarky and pessimistic about it . 
  ca n't say i 'm not tempted :p, 
  that list is pretty stupid . 
  they listed this guy too : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:tony_vairelles_fcg.jpg wtf ? 
  comment on the original article in [ the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21581779-professional-crime-gangs-eastern-europe-are-targeting-german-cities-gang-l-nder/comments#comments ) : `` there 's a famous chinese saying , when you open your doors , you invite flies in . '', 
  i laughed 5 minutes straight . 
  chinese wisdom is godlike, 
  where do i sign up ? 
   bonus racist insult : german police slang for gypsys is `` mem ''  mobile ethnische minderheit aka mobile ethnic minority that 's not a racist insult . 
  that 's a pc euphemism . 
   iubi-te-ar  facea-mi-as  smotoci-mi-ai  ma-tii ortography nazi, 
  for the common man : lack of initiative due to poverty and intimidating bureaucracy ( corruption ) ; at a governmental level : eu funds are harder to steal, 
  he 's forcing an english accent . 
  he would sound more natural if he 'd just let go of that, 
  yes , in a negative context they 're romanians . 
  in a positive one they 're gypsies/romani . 
  camp ? 
  that 's a cute euphemism for landfill . 
  romanian ? 
  that 's a cute euphemism for . . the culturally impaired, 
  sorry , but people were already determined by the protests in timisoara . 
  stop spreading urban myths . 
  i understood much of it , except i could n't make what `` ridere \\ ridero \\ ridessero '' was . 
  it should 've been obvious to me since `` a r\u00eede , r\u00eedere '' means `` to laugh '' in romanian . 
  i kept thinking it was related to `` riding '' ( stars ) . . anglosphere big !, 
  ( also overrides latin-sphere ) : <, 
  k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is delicious and sticky :d, 
  itsnotreallyawordifyoujusttypealotofthemwithoutspaces . . i mean it 's cool having compounds , but keept it sane ffs, 
  also du\u0219man ( enemy ) and musafir ( guest ) . 
  are n't you forgetting someone ? 
  good point , then it only applies to spaniards ? 
   i was arguing with a czech once who said that there are no beautiful cities east of vienna , tallinn was the first one that i pointed out . 
  budapest , dubrovnik , moscow just from the top of my head, 
  when i hear all this whining and desperation from spaniards and greeks , i 'm like : `` they just do n't know any worse , i guess '', 
  who will fight who ? 
  most countries are in nato and even if one member breaks away and attacks another , the rest of nato will have to take sides against the attacker .
