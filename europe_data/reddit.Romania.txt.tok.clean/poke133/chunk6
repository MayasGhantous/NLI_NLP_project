  ex : eyes forced open with test substance in them for n amount of hours etc. 
  only to latin ? 
  almost all languages had competing/diverging dialects up until nationalism and nation states came to prominence and imposed one official standard version of a set language . 
  printed press and modern ways of communication will prevent these frequent language splits ( or at least slow them down a whole lot on a historic scale ) . 
  that 's some tough central european stuff you got yourself into !, 
  ( someone needs to make a [ related poland ball ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/17nf80/thats_some_balkan_stuff_youve_gotten_yourself_into/ ) ), 
   some people will tell the problem is that they are dirty ** gypsy romans ** those god damned gypsy romans , invading hispania since 218 bc !, 
  ( seriously , you 're talking about ~ 1 million people most of which you do n't even notice . 
  i 'll leave you to wonder why . . ),

  sofia looks comically identical with bucharest . 
  except it seems to have more greenery which is a good thing . 
  i do n't get it either, 
  and how is that relevant to how things are now ? 
  so * racist * !, 
  good to know romania can into broadband [ master race ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8ii06k9csels2_&amp;ctype=c&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_y=avg_download_speed&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;idim=country:ro:se:us:gb&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg ), 
  so all the gypsies and scumbags are already in , but the honest working people are not welcome ? 
  well , too bad . . it 's still a net positive outcome for us either way :d, 
  from what i remember it was a fence to keep their children from always playing/running on the road . 
  do asians bring violence and drugs ? 
  what about muslims ? 
  funny how you call the countries with the best plumbers shitholes . . 
  ( i like the song very much ), 
   ice hockey to all you europeans who are not swedish , finnish , czech , slovak , or russian other types of hockey are irrelevant for most of the world by now . 
  no need to say it 's on ice, 
  aside from silent letters , french has pretty consistent rules when it comes to reading/writing, 
  romance bias incoming : french , spanish and italian , very elegant and with highly phonetic writing systems . 
  although some of their main accents are irksome : * the standard italian accent has an intonation that makes it sound like people are constantly arguing , discontent or reproaching * the standard spanish accent has a lisp , so i prefer latin american accents more, 
  i wanted to say `` i 'm glad it 's not the usual mundane , slow paced , bleak subject i 'd expect from a romanian film being praised at foreign festivals '' , but i 'm not quite sure . 
  that type of movie is more like documentaries for us , not really entertaining and `` spoiled brat who commits manslaughter by wreckless driving that ends in a cover-up '' is a common `` trope '' in romanian society . 
  but think of the women !!, 
  russian military taking the opportunity to look badass ( not that they are n't , but c'mon guys ), 
  yes , yes !, 
  i 'll prepare the wagon , we 'll get rid of the horse when we get there . 
  ~ ~ poland ~ ~ romania you are of genius !, 
  awww , your definition of `` outrageous '' must be really cute, 
  genetical study so racist that gypsies are not allowed into :d no seriously , they 're more relevant to europe than kurds or druze, 
  i sense some underlying prejudice here . 
  japan seems `` responsable '' , but it was n't enough . 
  this is not as clear cut . 
  it 's a good mix of racism and backwards/resistive culture ( which one is dominant varies on who you ask ) . 
  also overarching poverty !, 
  people act like poor romanians are a shining beacon of civilization compared to poor gypsies . . 
  we burn the paperwork to stay warm and call it a day . 
  you typed `` med '' because you ca n't spell mediterranean . 
  admit it !, 
  `` good !, 
  no pedos or blueballed churchmen to worry about '', 
  sorry , but you have a strong contender in romania nobody does post-industrial concrete wasteland better than us ( even with touches of north korean architecture ) https://www.google.ro/search?q=blocuri+romania&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch, 
  like i said it 's very uncommon . . and yeah the english translation sounds very dull , sorry, 
  better not be something embarassing though !, 
  i was taking an exam in college and the teacher started checking the attendance by calling each student by name . 
  at some point he called for some girl `` marcela capdefier '' . 
  capdefier is `` cap de fier '' ( head of iron ) written together ( this type of composite names are ridiculous in romanian , not to mention this one was pretty grotesque for a girl ) . 
  i laughed for about 15 minutes with some colleagues , then for another 30 minutes or so we laughed at eachother for not being able to supress laughter when we noticed that girl was right behind us . 
  best exam ever !, 
  slovenia and slovakia too, 
  that is a big unknown . 
  there are a lot of shallow theories like dacians being ethnically cleansed by the romans after conquest , or proto-romanians moving from a region south of the danube which was more assimilated , or even dacian language being related to latin in the first place :d, 
  we do n't have the verb `` to spell '' in romanian since everything is phonetical to express that verb you have to use a phrase :d, 
  nah , just a tiny list of ~ 100 words ( half of them with arguable claims of dacian origins ) by comparison ~ 15 % of romanian words are from old slavonic . 
  it 's not adolf tier , that 's for sure, 
  eu monys hard to steel no good bizniss i am of dissapoint, 
  hahaha . 
  pretty godlike comic . . too bad it 's not with polandballs , rather than ragecomics . 
  it 's not that bad . . i use 5 euros pre-paid cards with 4000 minutes/text messages a month in the same network and 100 minutes/texts in other networks ( +50 mb traffic for shits and giggles :d ), 
  thanks for explaining . 
  for calls it seems reasonable enough , because you can choose not to answer or when to hang up . . but you ca n't reject text messages . 
  ca n't help but always laugh at this ridiculous practice . 
  it also scares me a bit that the consumers in one of the most advanced countries in the world are putting up with that , since it goes well against common sense . 
  seriously . . where is the water over hungary from ? 
  you know what would be super interesting ? 
  a europe according to genuine gypsies :d, 
  these petty wars in the balkans are so irelevant in the grand scheme of things . . especially when there 's more pressing matters ( quality of life and stuff ), 
  `` vesel '' in romanian means happy as well . 
  good old slavonic stratum !, 
  i agree actually . 
  but , but . . we did n't get in conflicts with anyone in the region . 
  we play nice : <, 
  exactly . 
  a lot of romanians studied history infused with communist propaganda that was very nationalistic and anti-slavic ( anti might be a strong word , let 's say minimizing the genetical/linguistic contribution of slavic people ) . 
  however i 'm not sure if romanians as a whole have the same ancestors as hungarians . 
  maybe those living in transylvania do . 
  genetic studies show more overlap with bulgarians , serbs and ukrainians , depending on region ( other than transylvania ) . 
  the isp is rdsnet , that voxility thing should be the host of the site the problem with tracert is that it shows funny numbers that might be confusing because of reverse dns lookup and routers having a priority on what to do first then answer to traceroute ping is for pure measure of roundtrip time , while tracert is for seeing the hops , debugging connection problems, 
  enforceable how ? 
  i was at work when i did those tests . 
  anyway , you are right . . the router adds latency . 
  i 'm not used to having one since i bought it last month . 
  did n't bother to check how it affects latencies since i did n't notice a big change . 
  if i plug the ethernet cable directly in the computer i get the same 1ms pings though . 
  here 's a sample tracert ( with router ) though :  tracing route to computergames.ro [ 93.115.80.130 ]  over a maximum of 30 hops :   1 < 1 ms < 1 ms < 1 ms 192.168.0.1  2 1 ms 1 ms 1 ms 10.0.0.1  3 2 ms 2 ms 2 ms 172.21.1 xx.xxx  4 6 ms 3 ms 1 ms 86-126-92-50 . rdsnet.ro [ 86.126.92 . xxx ]  5 3 ms 1 ms 3 ms buc-ird-02gw . voxility.net  [ 109.163.235.157 ]  6 21 ms 10 ms 4 ms buc-ird-01c . voxility.net [ 109.163.235.58 ]  7 3 ms 2 ms 3 ms buc-ird-27sw . voxility.net [ 109.163.235.182 ]  8 4 ms 3 ms 2 ms www.computergames.ro [ 93.115.80.130 ]  trace complete . 
  btw why are tracerts more relevant than pings ? 
  i missed all the microstates ( who cares right ? 
  ) , croatia ( not eu yet ? 
  :p ) , brazil and suriname ( why no uk/netherlands dependencies neighbors then ? ), 
  i was kind of 100 % correct in my book . 
  http://pastebin.com/rxulg5fn in the beginning of that paste there are 2 servers with 30 and 60ms . 
  those were listed as romanian on http://www.gametracker.com/search/cs/ro/ , but doing a ip lookup on them shows they are german and uk ips the rest of them check out by being mostly 1ms :p, 
   exactly , what you think .
