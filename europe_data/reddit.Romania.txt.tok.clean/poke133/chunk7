  as a swede i disagree . 
  well , the demographics aspects disagree too . 
   now are you trying to prove a point , or are you just asking questions for no apparent reasons ? 
  i was just curious . 
  i get stable 30-40ms pings to germany , but we 're a lot farther and not direct neighbors . 
  inside romania i get pings between 1ms to 10 , you might get more with some really bad isp peering . 
  i pinged 15 cs servers at random and they were all 1ms . 
   he lives in carei ( near satu mare/hungarian border ) . 
  well , that 's not exactly an internet hub in romania . 
  that 's a provincial border town with a very small population . 
  for what it is , i think they have decent internet . .  my romanian friend usually gets around 45-60 ping with speedtest , regularly more , and 60-80 ping in most servers to what servers exactly ? 
  i imagine most of them know the latin alphabet , but not cyrillic script . 
  that will make things even harder . 
  perfect explanation . 
  it 's ok , son . 
  time to swallow it whole and move on . 
  this coalition rode a wave of popular hate against current president basescu which clueless eu beaurocrats defended/supported during the summer impeach scandal while listening to only one side ( the toxic propaganda aparatus he built around him ) . 
  there were no pollitical projects or promises . 
  i 'm sure the secret services will keep a close eye on them . 
  also what needs to be done is to encourage the silent majority of law abiding muslims to report any form of recruiting/extremism taking root , like it happened in the us . 
  of course this needs more dialogue , less hatemongering and quick heated reactions . 
  aye , we need some brave english souls to draw some arbitrary lines on the map in that general area . 
  i 'm sure it will improve things in unexpected ways . 
  journalists instigate fire fights and shit in warzones , just to squeeze more `` value '' for their content . . 
  maybe those are made in hk/china anyway and you 're buying from uk intermediaries ? 
  you guys are adorable, 
  high five , catalans !, 
  also i recognize the word for serbo-croatian . 
  we have it too in this form : https://dexonline.ro/definitie/izbeli%c8%99te it means `` left wandering , exposed to weather and danger , abandoned '', 
  i do n't get it . 
  he says `` do n't come to sweden '' because . . ? 
  nothing in the video argues against it , there 's even a guy agreeing he 'd pay more taxes to help immigrants ( wtf ), 
  what 's with the random italian translation ? 
  anyway , '' \u00cemi place mult limba rus\u0103 '' even though in romanian we have a saying : `` e\u015fti frumoas\u0103 ca limba rus\u0103 '' ( you 're as beautiful as the russian language ) which is meant to be sarcastic , i personally like the russian language . 
  people had another opinion about it when this phrase originated from , since they were forced to learn it . 
  the romanian mixed with russian loanwords spoken in moldova is pretty cool/funny . 
  wtf indeed ? 
  especially when : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paprika#etymology_and_history, 
  we 're still groggy , give us a minute . . where da snooze button at ? 
  let me guess , they were eating an ungodly amount of `` sarmale '' or do you mean just plain cabbage salad ? 
  i hate cabbage salad . 
  very funny either way . 
  we had a moroccan medical student as neighbor for a bit when i was still in grade school . 
  when he moved out he left me a bunch of lucky luke comics . 
  at first i was pretty puzzled of why this cowboy was speaking french . . 
  hmm , was n't xenu the bad guy ? 
  well , immigration has to come from somewhere . . sounds like you 're complaining, 
  funny how the people who have the most children are the ones who do n't bat an eye at hitting them . 
  not saying that is how you should treat them in general , but white people are getting too soft for their own good in more ways than one . 
  easier for you to say when you 're not in a critical situation . 
  how do you know your reaction when he 's putting himself and/or others in imminent danger ? 
  arguing would be pointless, 
  sure enough if it 's a toddler or a smaller kid , but if it 's 10 + year old that resists it 's not that easy . 
  i 'm not condoning discipline with violence in ordinary life , but in extreme circumstances you do n't have a choice . 
  their health or very life could be at risk . 
   mt snowdon  peaks at 1,085 m you what ? 
  challenge accepted . . 
  false , this is moral absolutism . 
  let 's say your child does something really dangerous just to spite you . 
  you explained him it 's wrong and asked him to stop , but he does n't perceive the danger of his actions , even more so in a situation where you do n't have time to argue . 
  what then ? 
  lol, 
  so . . liechtenstein ? 
  rip your inbox, 
  it 's not a crime , it 's a minor contravention . 
  we all have it . 
  i was in baku last autumn for a pro-gaming tournament . 
  first day there , the bus taking us from the hotel to the venue approached a turn with too much speed and skid on the wet marble ( or whatever it was ) in that park on the sea shore and almost fell off into the sea . 
  suffice to say it was pretty scary . . 
  same in hungary, 
  merkava looks ahead of its time , very cyberpunk :d, 
  please . . the rangers are a bunch of a amateurs and their theme sucked behold the true galactic justiciaries : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxkpdqlhge, 
  haha , good one, 
  these guys ca n't take a joke , jeez . . we romanians are typically butthurt from chronic irrelevancy . 
  the anti-eu stereotype of brits is kind of excessive , yes . 
  i imagine it 's even more annoying for the ones here who , for the most part , are pro-eu ( not that it would hurt my feelings if they were n't or something ) . 
  wow , damn . . nobody deserves this kind of roasting , not even in poland ball form ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ lol 'd ^ ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ ^ : <, 
  dallas was broadcasted after communism fell . 
  welp , at least they do n't sport the same flag as [ chad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_chad ) . . 
  he 's got a point though about the english language : envy - from old french * envie * ( noun ), 
  random question , does game of thrones dubbing translate john snow as jean neige ? 
  only in language ? 
  genetically we have a stronger ` slavic ' component than bulgarians , we have ethnographic similarities with our neighbors and we share the same religion ( except with hungary of course ) . 
  at least they ask you politely , here they just take it / s, 
   by people who 've never stepped into russia . 
  . . but russia stepped onto them . 
  you serbs have the luxury of never sharing a border with them . 
  be thankful for that , do n't squander it by becoming the annoying twat befriending the school bully just to look tough . 
  '' * da spirits be restless . 
  maaan . . take this elsewhere, 
  [ marvel at this then ] ( http://www.jubjub.ro/images/crap%20premium_small.gif ), 
  wow , i do n't get it . 
  is it reported more often in scotland or what ? 
  why the huge number ? 
  flaunting gdp numbers and rubbing it in the face of others for attention on an internet forum is uncalled for and reeks of desperation . 
   when we were dirt poor ( '80s ) our neighbors made fun of us and belittle us how and why ? 
  i do n't remember any of this . 
  not only we did n't have open borders or avenues of mass communication back then to interact frequently , why would they even make fun of us when it was obvious we were in the same sinking boat ( to varying degrees ) and we all suffered while the west flourished ? 
  let 's assume that you have some personal anecdotes with them making fun of us , so what ? 
  you do n't have to do the same and perpetuate meaningless dick measuring contests .
