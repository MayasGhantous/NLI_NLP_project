  . . and lastly , why would you care ? 
  you have some serious confidence issues my friend . 
  do you have to brag like that ? 
  please . . it makes me really uncomfortable, 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siktir we use it too as an insult , but we lost the original meaning : sictir ( vulgar ) ( usually said as `` hai sictir ! '' ), 
  a derogatory expression meaning begone !, 
  scram !, 
  people invested in either side of a conflict that happened centuries ago are pretty scary . 
  especially when they think in such cut and dry manner and keep forgetting geopolitical landscapes are ever shifting , allies becoming enemies and vice-versa : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland, 
   we do have a lot of loan slavic words the slavic words you mentioned are/were the de-facto words , most of the latin pairs are in fact loanwords . 
  to be honest , we 'd rather be known just for the gypsies :(, 
  orthodox priests can marry for starters . 
  that 's why the most common surname here is `` popescu '' ( `` son of priest '' ) . 
  dear polan , how to language : have consonant ?

  in the end it was the greeks who inherited the eastern roman empire and later on triggered the renaissance after ottoman conquest . 
  why do you think the lhc was mysteriously broken for 2 years ? 
  that poor weasel was framed . . http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36173247, 
  yeah , that works great as well if you 're using english subtitles i started learning english when hard drives were very small and codecs were primitive . 
  this was n't an option for me at that time . 
  if you 're a casual music listener , that is true . 
  however , if you want to truly enjoy the music you are passionate about , you 're very inclined to learn the lyrics and their meaning . 
  i developed my english lexicon exponentially after i started doing that . 
  when you think about it , at the rate english adopted foreign words throughout its history , it is an international language kind of like esperanto , but germanic-based , instead of romance-based . 
  yes , you will see the smell right before it kills you . 
  it will look like spawn of chtulhu, 
  nothing . 
  romantic nationalism , fascism and ceausescu 's later national-communism swept slavic influences under the rug and oversimplified our national identity as tracing back to romanized dacians . 
  it 's very disingenuous . 
  `` why are you so white ? '', 
  it 's the best worst one  ), 
  thanks for the article btw , it is very well written . . also very frightening . 
  i knew this place existed , but never understood the context . 
  even now i just glossed over the photos a few times being like `` well , poor gypsies , what 's new ? '', 
  before actually deciding to read it . 
  hard drugs like heroin complicate things tenfold . 
  the worst part is the kids being born and growing into this .

  that ghetto spans for about 4-5 streets , then things get gradually back to normal . . at least by eastern european standards :d but yeah , gypsies throwing trash out the window directly into the very street they dwell on , a classic move . 
  we have to respect it though , it 's their culture !, 
  `` p\u0103rin\u021bi '' means parents though in romanian . 
  they could say they got it from that . 
  | ti uccido con questa carne here that would be `` te ucid cu aceasta carne . '', 
  that 7 % on the map could be a lot more with a bit of study . 
  it 's always funny to hear italians who live here , a lot of them use a mix of italian and romanian that works really well to be understood . 
  they cut a lot of corners with it  also portuguese football players pick up romanian really fast . 
  hearing some of them in interviews after like 6 months of being here made my jaw drop . 
   romanian language has the richest heritage of latin of all the romance countries italians would roll their eyes at this sentence . 
  let 's tone a bit the superlative . 
   and linguistically you were slavic too grammar and most common words ( body parts , numerals , basic actions , elements of nature etc. ), 
  have latin roots . 
  i would n't say english is linguistically norman-french either , still a west germanic language . 
   before it was practically half slavic according to her half might be quite a stretch , but there were certainly more slavic words that fell into disuse or are forgotten . 
  most archaisms are related to rural/religious life or obsolete professions . 
  for example : [ neacsu 's letter from 1526 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac%c8%99u%27s_letter ) - oldest surviving document in romanian , includes 175 words out of 190 of latin origins ( excluding the first and last sentence which are slavonic formalities ) . 
  more than that , the letter can be understood even today with careful reading . 
  at least they use vowels . . irritatingly long vowels, 
  sorry , i actually meant moldavian autonomous ssr , present day transnistria . 
  classic russian move , eh ? 
  just as calling a strip of land in ukraine `` moldavian ssr '' then claiming the neighbouring region . 
   and mostly everyone hates it .
