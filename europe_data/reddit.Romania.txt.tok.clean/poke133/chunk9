  you 're actually saying the same thing as backwards muslim extremists who treat women this way, 
   actually , it 's already done . 
  i think you won here :d, 
  how do you read that ? 
  are there special pronounciation rules ? 
  where are the vowels ? 
  well , look at the brightside . . at least they 're honest enough to complain about their salaries here most politicians donate their salaries ( out of hypocrisy ) , while leaking 1000x more money from public funds via contracts with companies they control . 
  all ~ legal of course :d, 
  i would also add latinas are very attractive . . 
  you listed gdp with nominal values , not ppp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita, 
  you can be a eu member without being in the eurozone, 
  we all failed . 
  we 're stuck with a president that has a very low aproval rate and is only good at pollitical scandal, 
  a law can never be illogical or stupid , right ? 
  you do n't vote , you do n't count . . sorry also it does n't automatically make them basescu supporters as he 'd like to believe, 
  to be honest i do n't even know anymore . . i deleted that part from my post i 'm disappointed wether he stays or not , the new government seems to be a mix of crooks and incompetents as well ( headed by a proven intelectual thief ) . 
  but since i personally detested basescu the most , i wished at least he would be gone . 
  he knew he would lose so he told his minority of supporters to not show up and boycott the `` coup d'etat '' that was a referendum :d, 
  romanian logic : * gets elected with 5.2 million votes ( 50.33 % out of total expressed votes ) * gets impeached with 7.4 million votes ( 88.7 % out of total expressed votes ) - ** denied !, 
  i understand interlingua the most . 
  it 's like a simplified mix of romance languages ( spanish + italian mainly ) english grammar + romance writing/pronouncing = best combination possible imo, 
  romanian with partial tatar ancestry here . 
  baptized christian , raised with mixed religious influences . . turned out agnostic . 
  i consider all my muslim relatives , secular muslims . 
  the end . 
  dat finno-ugric c-c-c-combo breaker didn ; t understand : <, 
  no , no . . i do n't think i was clear here they steal all the money and the projects remain on paper . 
  you at least get something in exchange , however overpriced or late it may be :d, 
  sorry , but we actually look up to you guys :p at least your government managed not to steal all the money and built some kickass motorways : hu 1,314 km vs ro 371 km ( of which ~ 200 built by ceausescu ) . 
  i 'm almost a stranger in my own country because of the shit infrastructure . 
  there 's great places i 'll prolly never visit , unless i can afford plane tickets . 
  last week i came back from the seaside by train . 
  268 km in 6 hours , almost on par with a 2 horse chariot on roman roads . 
  nigel farage is not dangerous , he is necessary !, 
  without people like him it would be just one big circlejerk, 
  this election had a very simple effective choice for those you mention . 
  if you 're disgusted by the whole corrupt pollitical class , why not get rid directly of one of its biggest figures ? 
  romania : pannonian , continental , alpine , steppic , black sea only russia is more diverse , 
  hammered and gang banged from all sides :d, 
  yes , he did n't . 
  he was both a doormat and unconvincing . 
  that 's why after we ( hopefully ) vote our current president out of office , i want this guy gone too, 
  not for long , if you know what i mean :p, 
  there 's a little spin to this article i could do away with . 
  too much emphasis on basescu 's side , the last 3 paragraphs could be expanded in 10 more articles against basescu . 
  there were strong reasons for the [ virulent street protests this winter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_romanian_protests ) where people called for his resignation . 
  europe should be wary and not pick sides in this . 
  after all , both sides are comparably corrupt . 
  technically not balkans though, 
  this list can go on with more blatant stuff and some would still defend him . 
  the pollitical climate is unbearable , but why pick sides ? 
  especially with those who were in power for the last 5-8 years ? 
  i ca n't for the life of me understand that . 
  best thing to do is not to bother arguing with them . 
  was n't the nazi ideology considering only communist slavs to be subhumans ? 
  after all , they had allies like bulgaria and romania which are genetically in large part slavic . 
  how does that work ? 
  i guess it does n't , but what was their ideological `` excuse '' ? 
  that means i 'm welcome in / r/pyongyang ? 
  thank you glorious comrade, 
  not anymore . . jk :d i 'd say it 's not very common , but it certainly is not an odd name to have . 
  apparently the top10 names for boys in 2011 were : 1 . 
  david 2 . 
  eduard 6 . 
  alexandru 8 . 
  cristian 9 . 
  drago\u0219, 
  yay !, 
  romania can into slightly less retarded now :d, 
  nope . 
  working for what enemy ? 
  i 'd like to hear from you 20 years from now , when gene therapy will make you look scandinavian , tamil . . or even green ( we already have orange people :d ) i wonder what your white nationalist narative will cling onto then . . nose shapes ? 
  ear lobes ? 
  stormfront is over there - , 
  i read this as ` we certainly do n't want to invade europe ' for a milisecond i was immensely worried, 
  historical buildings mixed with communist appartment blocks and modern office towers . . typical identity crisis of eastern european cities :d, 
  do you honestly believe war is still possible between eu nations ? 
  disregarding the fact that most of them are nato members and some are nuclear powers even , i 'd like to think at this point war is almost unthinkable . 
  not according to wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_slovakia#ethnic_groups perhaps they do n't declare themselves as such ? 
  happens here too, 
  that 's true in serbia , because you are tough nationalistic people and the gypsy minority there is a lot smaller and less vocal . 
  but we kinder ~ ~ spineless ~ ~ romanians cower everytime they gang up on us , even the standard police fear them and let them slide easily . 
  if they absolutely have to deal with them , they ask for help from special intervention forces ( that wear balaclavas and are armed ), 
  for everything you listed i can give you counter examples from my experience having gypsy colleagues ( from first grade to college ) and co-workers . 
  it all boils down to : if you 're a decent person that happens to be gypsy , you get the same treatment as everyone else . . otherwise you stand out instantly . 
  good ol' nigel !, 
  as much as i want him to be wrong about the eu project , he is right . . and he is necessary , but who will listen ? 
  it 's quite obvious why : haplogroup n ( which is non-indo european ) : http://www.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup-n.gif, 
  alluding to war is taking it too far , even for competing nations with national flags in a sports event . 
  they 'll send their female biathlon team to snipe all the idiots at telegraph.co.uk relevant : [ white tights ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tights ), 
  size of army ? 
  wtf is this , the cia factbook ? 
  since when is that even remotely compatible with the olympic spirit ? 
   vote with your purchasing power . 
  buy eastern european products and support the eastern european producers and countries . 
  not as if we produce much , just sayin ' . . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_iceland.svg i hate the unwarranted use of the word , but . . this is epic as fuck !, 
  `` our '' people ? 
  we `` send '' them ? 
  you are not correct , btw you can keep them . . np ; <
