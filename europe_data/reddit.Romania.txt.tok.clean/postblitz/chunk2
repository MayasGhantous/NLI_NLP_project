  because economically , it did have the desired effect and it shows in the average gdp of russia 's citizens which dropped by more than 50 % . 
  coupled with the current oil prices means russia has little means to support itself economically and it will either translate in internal unrest ( that may lead to a coup in the long-term ) , desperately seeking alternatives ( moving the focus of its economic and political plays in other directions ) , further pointless aggression ( which will prompt nato into a potentially disastrous outcome ) or ( the best outcome from the eu pov  giving up on aggressive methods and leaving currently occupied territories . 
  always was and always will be called cehia here . 
  official names are only for formal events . 
  canadians fucking love our untapped gold mines in our pristine forests and mountains . 
  ceta would probably enable more shady deals to further said gold digging . 
  cheaper maple syrup, 
  do they want more ira activity ? 
  because that 's how you get more ira activity . 
  thanks , japan of europe, 
  [ here 's the preview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ) . 
  you 're welcome . 
  these assholes had money for decades and they * purposely * killed any electric car project . 
  tesla is merely providing what they could 've done since before i was born and i hope they get powerful enough to sink all the diseased elephants which rule the car industry . 
  also : always , always mentioning the ideal way something should be done as if the world is an utopia , never once taking into account the realistic or practical paradigm . 
  just go electric already , fuckers . 
  that just invites another ( bigger ) problem : moving all the scum from one capital to the other . 
  united kingdom , united manchester , united europe and united spain . 
  thank you once again . 
  i 'd rather we ( transylvania ) do n't become part of hungary or romania if it comes to critical decisions . 
  both budapest and bucharest only care about more clay to exploit ( tax and deprive ) rather than have strategic development plans . 
  i doubt we 'll ever get there though . 
   information is ultimate power - not dollars . 
  heh , reminded me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdrjybj047i,

  now if only people could stop drinking your great beer and actually get to see those places ... 
  it 's a buzzword . 
  a nice way of saying `` administration '' . 
  guess what all mayor 's jobs are ? 
  social engineering . 
  nobody cares , carry on . 
   the solution is bikes + public transport + delivery vehicles for various goods, 
   doublespeak it 's sad that this is the most appropriate term for how politicians and , with the advent of pc , regular people tend to speak . 
   rightful nice hypocrisy there . 
  being a victim does n't make you * right * and if everyone sought reparations the animosity would never end because all nations fucked over others at some point or another . 
  let 's not forget that we have had nothing to do with the people who are the true victims of what happened but are merely the descendents of the survivors . 
  you do n't understand sarcasm . 
  please stop posting . 
  no politician in romania would dare go against reunification . 
  the only reason it has n't happened already is due to the [ 14th russian army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_army_involvement_in_transnistria ) and influence in moldovan internal affairs . 
  our previous president was very outspoken for having a very close relationship with what are essentially our blood brothers and we have laws which grant their citizens citizenship here . 
  we 're doing all we can considering the geopolitical context and then this us fellow shows up to stir the pot . 
  automation will fix the lack of employees .

  stop resisting !, 
  tax dollars hard at work . 
  \\* stares at flair * oh russia , you so brutal . 
  and since it 's france we 're talking about , fashion-warfare is only natural . 
  they 've already [ declared war on non-wine & pork salesmen ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/04/sell-alcohol-and-pork-or-we-will-shut-you-down-french-town-tells/ ) . 
  vive la france !, 
   just google images of burkini , what 's wrong with that . 
  oh man , that looks like a scuba-diver/ninja suit . 
  it 's probably fine normally but how they can handle it in 40 degree weather is beyond me . 
  bible has that shit too . 
  it literally tells women are not allowed to wear their hair out in the open in temples . 
  then there 's the orthodox and catholic `` holy tradition '' which are like the hadiths you mention and aim to provide the fine print on things like how to behave and how the ceremonies of the churches are conducted . 
  thankfully , this shit is outdated and * most * who claim to be christians are laxed about it .

  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs00439-007-0460-x  the research , as would be expected , is dense , but concludes that the mutuations responsible for blue eye color `` most likely originate from the neareast area or northwest part of the black sea region , where the great agriculture migration to the northern part of europe took place in the neolithic periods about 6,000 -- 10,000 years ago . 
  the fact that it 's recessive mattered very little because it 's a very desired trait so blue-eyed people just had a shitton of babies to compensate . 
  blue eyes came from someplace in romania though . 
  random acts of pasta . 
  yeah but you worded your comment in a way that indicated the eu does n't care about turkey either , which is n't really true . 
  edrogan may be an asshole but romania had assholes in charge for many years and the eu saw past those in favor of our more capable people who did their job and together with the people somehow managed to get us in . 
  maybe , but entering the eu is n't something the eu is supposed to force or coerce other nations to do or hand out gradual benefits for `` intentions '' . 
  your country * must * be the one willing to change in order to become a proper member by looking after the [ accession process ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130437/ldm_bri ( 2013 ) 130437_rev3_en . pdf ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union  negotiations were started on 3 october 2005 [ 6 ] and out of 35 chapters necessary to complete the accession process , 15 have been opened and 1 has been closed [ these chapters ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/chapters-of-the-acquis/index_en.htm ) are something turkey has the obligation to take care of and whether or not they 're fulfilled has nothing to do with eu policies . 
  are you honestly telling me that a fully compliant and accession-ready turkey would be refused ? 
  because that is a notion i do not believe . 
  null pointer exception, 
   go to france  enter supermarket  not find any wine or champaigne absolutely haram !, 
   whole anti-turkish propaganda of brexiteers strengthen this thought they kicked themselves out though and have been decrying their decision ever since . 
  maybe you guys can become like [ park 's korea eh ? 
  honestly , i understand turkey 's troubles and edrogan * may * be the best option/lesser evil it has . 
  problem is this state of affairs makes turkey incompatible with the eu for the time being . 
  the whole refugee issue coupled with eu 's immigration incompetence only compounds the differences . 
  problem is we 're neighbours so you inevitably have lots of trash-talk . 
  cheating on tests is a very common thing in romania throughout every grade . 
  but it does not disprove `` you can easily afford such a car if you save up for 10 years working in rich countries '' which was the initial point he tried to counter . 
  so are keyloggers and phishing cardnumbers, 
  do these people want hitler ? 
  because that 's how you get hitler . 
  he is in his home country , which is more than that jesus guy can say . 
  western society has che guevarra 's face all over . 
  the world is funny like that . 
   scotland is n't a country huh , last i checked scotland is part of a union of * countries * and has gained its independence by defeating england around 1314 as depicted in the documentary film braveheart starring mel gibson . 
  then they just got themselves stuck to england out of convenience . 
  yes but those were dirty eastern formerly-soviet block states and spain is glorious western civilization sovereign nation part of nato . 
  plus it 's very hot in spain and it 's far from moscow which is a major drag . 
  most russians are misinformed , the ones in the know dislike him but either know enough to shut up or do n't live there . 
  you did n't get the point of my comment . 
  yes , he was right about * this matter * but that is n't a consequence of orban 's normal judgement : it was simply an aligning of a somewhat-extremist pov with the somewhat-extremist circumstances . 
  you may or may not know orban and his party but he 's not really a man you can trust with making laws for all sort of topics which benefit from liberal thinking . 
  this does n't mean i did n't agree with what his attitude was from the start . 
   eastern europe said this at start of refugee scrisis that allowing shitload of people from conflict zones without proper vetting is really really bad idea i 'm from that place and while we knew very well it 's a bad idea what was more disparaging was the fact the eu held barriers for us and everyone around for decades . 
  allowing foreigners with no european background to go wherever they please inside schengen whereas very high level university educated people were unable to from our country without a ton of paperwork and approvals was more strange than anything else . 
  it 's like when you work hard for years to enter a distinguished club and watch the dangerous retards waltz inside without the blocking you were subjected to .
