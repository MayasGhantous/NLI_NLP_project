1 dimension too many . 
  that 's because you pay tax on profit not revenue . 
  apple on the other hand paid between ** 1 % ** to ** 0.005 % ** on ** profit ** , which is a huge distinction to make . 
  apart from a few religious loonies i do n't think anyone really cared . 
  not to mention our legislation is similarly strict in cases like that . 
  overall norway actually has a very good image in romania since you 're seen as a corruption free developed country and the norwegian government invests in a lot of small projects in the country which make the news from time to time . 
  there 's [ one of them in my home county ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/societate/video-inchisoarea-minima-securitate-delta-dunarii-locul-detinutii-aproape-liberi-1_57f2a6085ab6550cb83b7941/index.html ) , an open air minimum security prison built by the inmates themselves as a project to teach them an useful skill and hopefully lower recidivism rates , which in my opinion is a really cool project , something we need more of . 
  i 'm surprised we 're that high too , usually we 're pretty low in these opinion polls . 
  there have been a few of them posted on this sub and we 're usually around where russia and middle eastern countries are , you 'd think we 've invaded a few countries or sponsored terrorism in other countries based on those polls . 
  the english media having the most reach probably does n't help , especially when we had incidents like that [ sky news cunt ] ( https://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-prosecutors-go-british-sky-news-reporters-arms-trafficking-scandal/ ) making up negative stories . 
  sure , you can be anti-capitalist , but again that 's not really the root cause of corruption in romania . 
  it 's a mix of poverty ( which ` capitalism ' has been helping with ) , lack of transparency and oversight , weak judicial and public institutions , general mistrust of said public institutions , etc. 
  your rant about capitalism implied it . 
  it 's a flawed system , but it 's not the root cause of corruption . 
  oh yeah because we did n't have any corruption during communist times , oh please . 
  that means we can use vadim rolling in his grave as a generator to power half of the country . 
  ( for non-romanians , vadim tudor is the late leader of our far-right loonies , greater romania party ), 
  psd : `` we 're just getting started , do n't worry ! '', 
  pretty unlikely at this point , eu27 seem to be united behind the negotiations . 
  the only way i can see eu27 accepting a reversal is if the uk loses some or all of its opt-outs , but that would probably be universally opposed by the public in the uk . 
  we 've already reached the 2 % target this year , this commitment is for maintaining this level of spending until 2026 . 
  our ministry of defense must be doing some heavy breathing right about now , they 've never had this level of funding and assurances of future funding . 
  politically this is to compel future governments to stick to the 2 % target and also show our nato allies that we 're serious about our defense spending and nato commitments . 
  that 's actually really interesting , i had no idea the eu had such a positive image in the world . 
  brazil seems very high at 94 % seeing the eu in a positive light , i wonder why ? 
  china at 84 % and india at 83 % also represents a few billion people . 
  i 'm here to hate , not have my opinions challenged !, 
  that 's about $ 84 billion worth of growth in only one quarter , about one slovakia worth of growth . 
  does that still seem low ? 
  do n't worry , we have 3 more years of psd . 
  probably does n't help that out shitstains in power are n't bothering to prepare a serious bid either ... 
  the eu already has sanctions on iran for their human rights abuses ... 
  if you 're going to post an appeal to emotion , at least be factual about it . 
  am originally from the region and there was n't much industry to begin with , most of the people in those small villages just fish or practice subsistence farming , like they 've been doing for generations . 
  the delta is starting to see more tourists , so that should help those communities a little bit at least . 
  we 're both in the eu now though , there 's nothing stopping anyone in hungary from moving to transylvania if they want to live there . 
  a lot of areas even have administration and education in hungarian too . 
  [ sea of brutalism ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zfy7uit.jpg ) in bucharest , glorious !, 
  yeah , that would be seen as corruption over here . 
  but then again it 's difficult to compare between two countries with different legislation and outlooks on what corruption is . 
  nice meme , it 's almost as if ireland was offered a lot of concessions for the second vote , but you know , evil eu ruh-rah !, 
  regarding citizen rights , the eu ca n't legally negotiate anything until article 50 is triggered . 
  klaus has been off the hook recently with good political moves such as this one , he 's been very active with visits abroad too which is a nice change from the previous president we had . 
  too bad he has to deal with the shit stains in parliament , but he does n't really have much power when it comes to internal matters . 
  the lines are already drawn , nato or eu members ( eu has a defensive clause ) getting invaded would result in military action . 
  even if it 's little green men , the country in question will have so much military transported there that all of them will be snuffed out . 
  the recent nato exercises in romania and poland are training for those exact issues . 
  the eu-ukraine association agreement was finally approved recently , of course they 'll try to further destabilize ukraine , it 's how putin 's russia works . 
  having most of these former soviet states/satellites slowly progress towards proper democracy , rule of law and economic prosperity is bad news for putin , the russians back home might get some nasty ( for him and the russian oligarchy ) ideas . 
  read the article :  the index , called the soft power 30 , combines polling in 25 countries and objective digital data to measure a country 's impact . 
  the polling looks at the perceived favourability towards countries . 
   issues covered include government , culture , cuisine -- including the number of michelin-starred restaurants -- foreign policy , street violence , sporting prowess , digital engagement , perceived capacity for economic innovation , and attractiveness for both tourists and foreign students . 
  the guardian had to sneak some of their shite in there somehow , guess they could n't help themselves . 
  since a few comments are taking issue with the first point , that the `` eu has been keeping the peace for 70 years '' , is it really that far fetched ? 
  how ignorant do you have to be of the eu 's history to even contest that point ? 
  some of the first couple of lines of the [ treaty of rome ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/romania/sites/romania/files/tratatul_de_la_roma.pdf ) should give you a few hints :  ** '' ** * determined to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of europe * ** '' ** ** ^ 1 **  ** '' ** * resolved to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide europe , * ** '' ** [ ... ]  ** '' ** * resolved by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty , and calling upon the other peoples of europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts , * ** '' ** the last quote is basically the main idea behind the creation of the escs and ecc , which later turned into the eu , integrate the european economies so that future conflict not only seems pointless but ludicrous . 
  ** ^ 1 ** i quoted that part as a side note for the ones decrying the continuing integration that 's happening in the eu , especially in relation to a lot of brits saying they did n't sign up for a more integrated eu . 
  yes , you did , it 's literally in the first lines of the treaty of rome which preceded uk 's membership by 16 years . 
  you 're right , guess it remains to be seen where it ends up , but it does n't seem like romania will get an agency anytime soon . 
  i remember reading an article in romanian analyzing the dutch bid in comparison to our piss poor one ( or lack of a concrete one for that matter ) , it 's very solid and the chances that the netherlands will get the agency are pretty high . 
  looks like the netherlands is going to snag the medicines agency too , that 's another ~ 700 well paying jobs out of the uk . 
  little by little it adds up and will no doubt hurt uk growth . 
  we also have a bid to host that agency , but our current government is led by mentally retarded people so our chances are 0 . 
  i 'm sure greece would have preferred to borrow from the free market at  25 % interest rates instead of taking that german money with interest rates lower than the inflation rate , stop oppressing them !, 
  what parts of malm\u00f6 did you visit that made you feel unsafe ? 
  did you go ` ghetto ' sightseeing or something ? 
  the crime rate there is comparable to romanian cities and the city center is actually pretty nice , you should know that since you did say you * visited * the city . 
  and i mention far right because a lot of the ` malm\u00f6 is a hellscape ' idiocy comes from those kinds of sources , and i did n't even mention nazis , not sure why you 're resorting to fallacies . 
  i 'm not saying that we should ignore the issues , there clearly are some issues that we need to address as a bloc , the main ones being tackling the libyan migrant route , reforming the current asylum system , helping italy and negotiating deportation agreements with safe countries , but i 'm annoyed by how many troll accounts just started popping out of nowhere in almost every single migrant thread , posting the same stupid shallow messages that barely even touch the problem but score brownie points because they appeal to the overall reactionary opinions a lot of people currently have . 
  ps : the eu is actually already working on a lot of those issues , started training and financing what remains of the libyan coast guard ( libya is experiencing a civil war right now ) , has been negotiating deportation agreements ( signed one with afghanistan already ) , and the asylum system is undergoing reform currently . 
  i 've actually lived in malm\u00f6 for 5 years and the ` ghettos ' you talk about like roseng\u00e5rd are n't nearly as bad as you think and actually mainly populated by former yugoslav refugees rather than ` brown people ' , which is a term i used to deride some of the more loony comments . 
  there are some issues , but it 's nowhere near as bad as how a lot of the far-right media portrays that city . 
  by all means , actually go visit malm\u00f6 and see how much of a ` ghetto ' the city is , because the quality of life there is much better than any romanian city , even in those ` ghettos ' . 
  not to mention romanian cities are n't foreign to the concept either , but we easily glance over shitty neighborhoods like ferentari . 
  be my guest , it was a spur of the moment kind of thing because i got annoyed at some of the comments in this thread . 
  ** '' ** * listen here you stupid european/german , let me tell you about your country and how it should be governed !, 
  merkel is a cancer and too many brown people are coming !, 
  i do n't hate brown people , i actually have a token brown friend , but let me tell you , europe is going to be engulfed in civil war soon , european culture and society is going to die and become a shakira law hellscape because too many of them are coming !, 
  i know this because i read the_trumplethinkskin and prestigious sources like infowars . 
  * * no , i have never been to germany , but i 'm sure society there is crumbling as we speak !, 
  * ** '' ** * - several days old account which comments mainly in migrant related threads in r/europe * that 's my tl ; dr : for most of these migrant related threads that pop up in r/europe recently . 
  the increased trade helps , our trade with eu members more than tripled since we joined the eu 10 years ago , which undoubtedly resulted in quite a lot of jobs being created in germany , france , italy , and our other eu trading partners . 
  ascension does n't have to be about cheap workforce or more consumers , just bringing stability and prosperity to a new country on our fringe will reap benefits in the long term . 
  look at how fast the e-eu economies are growing right now , that growth is felt in w-eu countries too because of how interconnect our economies are . 
  and for a country to join the eu , it has to complete a series of acquis chapters that are meant to bring their society , legislation and economy up to eu norms . 
  for example , if ukraine would properly complete all of the acquis chapters , they 'd be a vastly different country than they are today . 
  but again , expansion probably wo n't happen in the near future anyway . 
  when we had our scandal , i think one producer justified it by saying that consumers in romania tend to buy cheaper products so they have to use cheaper ingredients to lower prices . 
  does n't really justify it , but it 's a different perspective . 
  i wonder if they even cost the same . 
  i 've been living abroad for about 8 years now and i come back home from time to time , i did notice that some brands taste different , but they 're also cheaper in romania . 
  we signed our association agreement in 1993 though . 
  we only joined 14 years after we signed our association agreement ( or 12 years after we applied for membership ) , and at that time quite a few eu members were pushing for expansion in the east . 
  nowadays it seems like further expansion is a pretty thorny subject , so countries wo n't have it as easy as we did . 
  no , i get what you meant and it was well deserved to point that out , lots of people were against romania and bulgaria joining , and even more so our ascension was fast tracked , reason why we have the judicial monitoring still . 
  i think the eu learned a lot of lessons from that time , reason why ascension negotiations will be a lot more strict in the future . 
  the only country with a shot of joining the eu within the next 5 years to a decade is probably montenegro . 
  an agreement that 's supposed to promote stability and spur judicial reforms in ukraine ? 
  are people really this ignorant that they 're confusing an association agreement with ascension talks or membership ? 
  ukraine is at least a decade away from even being able to receive candidate status .
