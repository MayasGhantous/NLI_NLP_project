  he is working hand-in-hand with hungary now . 
  honestly now , austria 's migrant problems did n't start in 2015 , that was just the boiling point . 
  actually , when i first went there , 12 years ago , there were already people complaining about foreigners , especially turks , but also eastern europeans . 
  in fact , my cousin told it would be a good idea if i did n't dress like an ausl\u00e4nder ( i was 13 at the time and had lots of adidas and nike tracksuits , because i thought i looked tough ) because otherwise people would make fun of me . 
  i think people want more radical change . 
  i do n't think they want to send migrants to the gas chambers or deport them but at least to see them becoming more integrated in austrian societies , not little istanbuls and little sarajevos . 
  i can sympathize with that , every country should protect its culture and values and those who do n't want to adopt them should be allowed to stay . 
  learning to speak german properly and not act like a total asshole should n't be that hard . 
  well , his views are a bit more mainstream than , say , wilders , but his party does have nazi roots . 
  however , toning down their rhetoric seems to be a trend with far right politicians these days as they are trying to get into mainstream politics . 
  i mean when you have a legit russian neo-nazi like dmitry demushkin taking pictures with a black british journalist , you know something must be up . 
  it does n't matter that much what his actual powers will be , it 's about sending a message , not only in austria , but all over europe . 
  although i 'm not a fan of far right movements , i 'm no fan of current european states of affaires either , so in the case he wins , all i can hope is that it will make western european politicians get off their asses and start addressing the concerns of the people . 
  if they do n't do that , then more and more far right leaders will start winning elections and our eu is going to start looking a lot more hitlery . 
   i think it 's not good if we automatically assume that everyone born in romania is automatically romanian well i agree , but it 's still rather debatable . 
  of course , those living in seklerland for example are unquestionably hungarians , but others not so much . 
  there are hungarians in timisoara , who identify as ethnic hungarians at censes ( i think this is the plural of census ) but do n't really speak that much hungarian . 
  would you still consider them hungarians ? 
  this is even more obvious with other ethnicities , for example a friend of mine is a croat , but whenever someone asks him to say something in croatian he tells them to go fuck themselves ( he never admitted it , but most likely ca n't speak any croatian ) . 
  well , there are many hungarians who identify as romanians also . 
  actually , outside of seklerland , cluj and oradea there are n't that many people who identify themselves as hungarians . 
  another funny thing is that there are many romanians with hungarian citizenship . 
  thanks to orban \u2122 , now any romanian who can say j\u00f3napot k\u00edv\u00e1nok , igen , k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m , viszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra and memorize an oath can become a full hungarian citizen and travel to the us without a visa . 
  of course , that ship has long sailed . 
  today what 's left is only hungarian pipe dreams of greater hungary , but of course no one besides nationalist hungarian dumbfucks support it . 
  switzerland manages just fine as a confederation . 
  as long as the economy would have worked out and hungary would have stayed put , i do n't think there would have been many major difficulties . 
   even die-hard pro-russians are getting those because shopping in iasi is way cheaper that in chisinau . 
  [ how to get from transnistria to europe 101 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/or6usu3.jpg ) as a side note , moldovans do n't need romanian citizenship to shop in iasi , because they do n't need visas to travel to europe since 2014 . 
  fun fact - even transnistrian `` officials '' can be observed casually shopping in iasi on weekends . 
  fun fact # 2 - moldova plans to register transnistrian license plates so we might soon see cars with transnistrian plates being casually driven around in romania and other eu countries . 
  the situation was n't as simple `` as poor romanians oppressed by hungarians '' . 
  yes romanians ( as well as czechs , serbs , slovaks , italians etc. ), 
  living in austria-hungary did n't have as many rights as austrians and hungarians , but they were n't exactly treated like slaves or anything . 
  this was due to change anyway , with the federalization plan devised by romanian lawyer aurel popovici and strongly supported by franz ferdinand . 
  of course the hungarians were butthurt about the plan , but i think it would have eventually went through as hungarians were only 20 % of the empire 's population and pretty much everyone else would have supported the plan . 
  unfortunately , some idiot serb terrorist decided to assassinate the archduke and we all know how it went from there . 
  of course , it 's impossible to predict what would have happened if the archduke did n't get pwned , but probably there would n't have been wwi , therefore the conditions in which people like lenin , hitler and stalin came to power would have never developed . 
  the us also probably would n't have gotten nearly as powerful as it is today . 
  fun fact : there were many romanians who fought on the side of austria-hungary , including against romania . 
  some did it because they had to , others did it because they really believed in austria-hungary . 
  there are still some romanians in transylvania who wish the united states of greater austria would have become reality . 
  actually , the whole idea of the usga was the brainchild of romanian lawyer aurel popovici . 
  when i was in university a professor wanted to sue several students for copyright infringement because he caught them with photocopies of his book ( i also had a photocopied version , but i was smart enough not to bring it with me ) . 
  i do n't know if he went through with the case because it was near the end of my final semester . 
  wtf , who eats pizza with knife and fork ? 
  it 's almost as bad as eating sushi with a knife and fork . 
  it 's not about moldovans ( who are romanians anyway ) , it 's about the artificial state called republic of moldova and the traitors who run it . 
  15 % of moldovans already have romanian citizenship and that number is growing every year . 
  before you know it , the only `` moldovans '' left will be russians , ukrainians , turks ( gagauz ) and romanian traitors . 
   but i do n't just pay for rent/utilities and food you also are n't a refugee . 
  the average romanian urban dweller probably spends as much as a german on food , definitely more than the average pole or czech . 
  romanians are greedy when it comes to food , so it 's not really a good comparison . 
  there are college kids spending 50 lei per week on food , if a college kid can survive , a refugee can also survive . 
  shelter is provided to them by the government , so the only things they need to spend money on is hygiene stuff , which is not that expensive , and clothes , which again , are n't very expensive since refugees do n't need to wear name brand stuff . 
  internet and phone plans are also dirt cheap . 
  of course they wo n't afford to go to the cinema , club , restaurants or on vacation , but that really is beyond the point . 
  the russians come uninvited anyway . 
   because you can get by pretty easily using only english until you learn the language . 
  if you are going to use english you will probably never learn the language , thus never integrate fully . 
  dutch people will always be happy to speak with you in english and even if you try to speak with them in dutch and you are n't so good with it , they will respond to you in english which can be pretty annoying if you are trying to learn the language . 
  lol , this is the most embarrassing military parade ever . 
  90 % of the vehicles they showcased were donated by other countries , like those humvees which were donated by the us because they want to get rid of them or those smurd vehicles donated by romania . 
  also , britain only sent 4 guys . 
  it kinda shows what moldova 's international standing is . 
  they should have abstained from all this military parade stuff , let the countries who actually have a military show it off . 
  the moldovan army fought only one war , which they lost , and they lost miserably , i 'm surprised they even had the balls to talk about `` the battles on the dniester '' . 
   i ca n't understand the announcer and got a bit confused when he started mentioning eritrea and indonesia lol . 
  he said they participated in un peacekeeping missions there . 
   in romania i guess they wo n't even be given enough money for food that 's ridiculous , refugees get 540 lei per month , which is more than enough for food . 
  they do n't want to come to romania because romania does n't offer them the luxury they dream of , very well , it 's better if they just fuck off from here imo . 
   and they are n't ever going to be able to improve because no one is publishing `` romanian for arabic speakers '' materials . 
  there are non-refugee arabs who come here to study and learn romanian without any problems . 
  as for the `` refugees '' , why would they need to integrate , theoretically they 're supposed to be sent back to their home countries after the war is over . 
  all the problems you mentioned ( mineriads , vaccine problems , rampant corruption - which in itself is not really enough to be considered erosion of legitimate authority but whatever ) were either solved ( like the mineriads or ethnic tensions with the hungarians ) or brought under control ( like corruption ) . 
  that 's the whole point of country building - you face problems and you find ways to solve or mitigate them . 
  the us also had the la riots , uk had their london riots and so on ... 
  many examples can be given from developed countries . 
  it 's not relevant because these things were temporary , in moldova it 's the status quo and has been for a quarter century , that 's what makes it a failed state . 
   and according to you the difference between canada and moldova is that moldova is refusing to acknowledge their ( romanian ) roots ? 
  and that 's the reason they ca n't be a country ? 
  it 's not about refusing to acknowledge their romanian roots , they ca n't even agree among themselves what their history or even language is . 
  their identity is a constant point for debate in politics and intellectual circles . 
  they are torn in half , one half wanting to be with russia and the other wanting to be with the eu and romania . 
  it 's like when you are debating if you want to study science or humanities and you end up studying neither and going to clean toilets for a living . 
  in 25 years they have essentially managed the incredible performance of doing absolutely nothing . 
  they did n't build an economy , they did n't build strong institutions , they do n't even have control of all their territory . 
  speaking of that , transnistria alone ( excluding russian troops ) has an army with more active troops , better trained , better equipped and better funded than the actual moldovan army . 
  actually , if you look up `` failed state '' on wikipedia , you notice moldova shares most characteristics : - loss of control of its territory , or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force therein ** check ** - erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions ** check ** - inability to provide public services - ** partially true ** - inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community - ** not quite there , but all it would take would be for a pro-russian party to take charge and they are n't far from that ** . 
  the usa has a solid foundation , they fought a war for their independence , they have their founding fathers and all and since wwi , they have strongly influenced the culture and politics of pretty much every country on earth . 
  the us is the main reason why english is still widely spoken after the collapse of the british empire , let 's be honest , if it was n't for the us , english would have had the faith of french , more or less . 
  as for canada , australia and nz , they have no problem acknowledging their british roots , they do n't try to make up their own history . 
  the queen is still the head of state and australia and nz incorporate the union jack in their own flags . 
  moldova does not fit into either category . 
  they claim to have their own distinct identity , until 2-3 years ago the official language was even called `` moldovan '' , it took a court order to rule the official language was actually romanian and there are still some morons who challenge this . 
  they claim their people are the inhabitants of the former principality of moldavia , but if that is true , how come in the romanian part of moldavia ( which is actually larger than the so-called republic of moldova ) there is absolutely no one identifying themselves as moldavian except in regional context ? 
  it 's a state built exclusively on lies and propaganda . 
  such a state can not last , it will collapse eventually . 
  the cracks have always been there and they are only getting larger as time goes by . 
  so it 's not important if the european commission is competent or not , all it matters is the skin color .
