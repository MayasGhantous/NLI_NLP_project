  there simply is no plan . 
  the more time passes after the referendum , the less likely it becomes that anything will happen . 
  personally , i would want to see the uk out as soon as possible , but i have no say in the matter and neither do you . 
  it 's a good troll though . 
  actually the chinese know how to deliver [ some street justice ] ( https://youtu.be/yb18enuhvak ) . 
  better than us romanians , at least . 
  i 've lived in london in the past for two years , the only time i felt threatened by anyone , it was a bunch of white english blokes . 
   they have their own passports , which nobody recognises ( ok maybe 3 un countries ) . 
  there 's no un country that recognizes transnistria . 
  well , moldova is a small country , so it 's very likely someone in your family voted for those clowns at some point . 
  the point is they were n't brought to moldova by aliens from outer space . 
  you ca n't sell manure and label it as chocolate . 
  if you want to sell fantasy , you must label it as fantasy , not as news . 
  both ukraine as well as the west got burned with poroshenko . 
  tough to accept all those deaths were for essentially nothing , but reality does n't mirror our desires . 
  hope this shit wo n't come to romania , this summer they tried everything to kill mosquitoes in my city , like spraying insecticides from helicopters and trucks and yet you ca n't open your window to have a smoke without an entire army of these bloodthirsty motherfuckers getting in . 
  greece is also in a deep economic crisis . 
  no one is saying moldova should spend $ 5 billion , like greece , but $ 160 million would be a reasonable number instead of $ 16 million , as it is currently . 
  also , who is to blame that moldova stagnated for the past 25 years ? 
  you ca n't even blame russia for this , it was your own choices that brought you here . 
  look at the people you have elected , almost all of them are nothing more than parodies of themselves , not only the newer ones , like dodon and usatyi , but also the older ones like snegur , lucinschi , voronin . 
  not to spare the `` pro-eu '' ones like filat or lupu of course , they are n't much better . 
  i do n't think so , these guys have some money , they would have probably made more than a simple contact form . 
   they also ca n't go through the air unless they get permission from moldova or ukraine since transnistria is landlocked . 
  moldova does n't have any fighter jets , nor any anti-air capability except for low flying aircraft . 
  russia routinely violates their airspace and there 's nothing they can do except whine about it . 
   my original comment was n't exactly aimed at russia 's units specifically , but more so to make the situation in transnistria so bad ( as if it is n't shit enough ) to try and make the people their demand that the russian soldiers leave , which would mean an end to the blockade . 
  transnistria alone has more active troops , better trained and better equipped than moldova . 
  add to that the russian troops already stationed there and you realize they could potentially occupy chisinau before nato even realized what the hell was going on . 
  that 's why moldova ca n't do shit except whine , a blockade would mean war . 
  they already do that . 
  most transnistrians have moldovan citizenship and many even have romanian citizenship . 
  if you go to some shopping mall in iasi in a weekend , there 's a high chance you will run into some transnistrian official . 
  of course , not top dogs like shevchuk , those are doing their shopping in amsterdam , london or paris , but still someone who probably goes on pervyi pridnestrovye tv every once in a while to talk about the evil fascist romanians . 
  recently , they have even registered all civillian cars with transnistrian plates in moldova so they can freely travel into europe . 
  obviously , it does n't work . 
  you do n't change the minds of people who have been brainwashed for 70 + years with a few vacations in europe . 
  officially , russia ca n't get military equipment into transnistria , not by land at least . 
  they 're probably getting those supplies there by air . 
  they will just officially recognize transnistria as an independent country and wo n't pull out shit . 
  a union between moldova and romania would be very bad for romania and the eu/nato . 
  currently , russia has very few supporters in romania , their classic propaganda does n't even work here , so they resort to covert propaganda ( anti-western `` news '' websites and blogs , but which are not openly pro-russian ) . 
  however , if moldova was to unite with romania , all those pro-russians would suddenly find themselves in romania and together with hungarian extremists they would stand a good chance to be able to destabilize the country . 
   there 's no point in investing in military for moldova . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  the real threat for moldova is n't a full scale russian invasion , but a crimea/donbass scenario . 
  russia would n't launch a full scale invasion of moldova unless ww3 starts and moldova is in the way . 
  otherwise , they would just try to pull something off with the transnistrians , the gagauz , soviet transplants ( which are the 5th column ) and the 14th army + some russian tourists . 
  now this is a force moldova could take on , ** if it had a good enough military ** , as it is very difficult to resupply those forces unless russia completely invades ukraine . 
  being a small country is no excuse , for example greece spends almost 2.5 % on military , despite being a much smaller country than turkey . 
  this is the second largest percentage in nato after the us . 
  is your country is threatened , you do n't rely on others to defend it . 
  nato , including romania , wo n't send a single tank to defend moldova , unless it is a part of nato . 
  nato will never accept moldova as a member , unless it will agree to spend at least 2 % of gdp on military ( and even then it 's doubtful ) . 
  currently , moldova spends less than 0.2 % on its military . 
  there are russian oligarchs who probably spend more on their personal security than moldova spends on its entire military . 
  this is unacceptable , estonia is also a small country , actually much smaller than moldova in terms of population and they still spend 2 % . 
  you have absolutely no excuse . 
  there was also a parody about the [ gypsies deported from france ] ( https://youtu.be/1h-ommkjypk ) by sarkozy . 
  he 's not , but the video was filmed in romania . 
  the chorus goes like :  i 'm a sinti from head to toe  whenever i hear these drums , it boils my blood  i 'm a gypsy , gy-gy-gypsy  gypsy , i 'm a gypsy  my people do n't have it so easy  so if you 're not careful , then it is mine  i 'm a gypsy , gy-gy-gypsy  gypsy , i 'm a gypsy , - psy, 
  fsb is responsible for sigint as well . 
  they have had sorm for decades to monitor telephone and internet traffic and more recently the new counterterrorism law which will require phone companies to store metadata for up to three years and email/messaging services to introduce cryptographic backdoors for the fsb to be able to snoop . 
  it will most likely turn out to be a disaster and will have no effect whatsoever on security . 
  mass surveillance is only good for fucking your political rivals and/or dissidents , it does not help with security , there 's simply too much data . 
  when did nato conduct exercises inside a country without that country 's approval ? 
  does n't give a shit . 
  the only two eu countries that have suffered major terror attacks in the last couple of years are france and belgium . 
  maybe it 's because their cells in france/belgium are better organized , especially considering how most attackers were tied to molenbeek somehow . 
  look at russia for example , the fsb is very good , yet they still have a lot of terrorist attacks . 
  moldova never invested in their military , they spend like $ 16 mil . 
  on their military annually , that 's what russia spends on its military in a couple of hours . 
  moldova had the chance to unite with romania in the 1990s and have a better future . 
  back then , both countries were shit economically , so it would n't have been a big deal to integrate the two countries , but now the differences are too big . 
  moldova has become a prisoner of its own corruption and incompetence , they should n't expect much help from the outside world unless they start making serious changes . 
  the west already got burned with poroshenko in ukraine , it would be foolish to trust the moldovan leadership . 
  wait , he 's 40 ?!, 
  by his looks i would have said he 's at least 60 . 
  wtf is he , a recovering crack addict or something ? 
  when the end of civilization comes , you 'd want to have this shit by your side ( the actual gun , not the model ) . 
  is this a joke ? 
  someone please tell me this is a joke . 
  they wo n't . 
  this is just textbook propaganda which they need in order to secure evermore funding for the gchq 's mass surveillance programs . 
  it 's the exact same kind of bullshit the american govt . 
  is using and not very far from the kind of bullshit putin is using . 
  this smells like crappy propaganda to me and unfortunately , judging by some of the comments in this thread , it seems like crappy propaganda that works . 
  the gchq stopped an unnamed terrorist group from carrying out an attack in an unnamed location . 
  yup , sounds legit . 
  `` the review has been well received by prime minister theresa may '' , oh really ? 
  how could it have been otherwise , since may has been pushing for the surveillance state even before she was at the home office ? 
  even if real , it does not prove any benefit to the gchq 's mass surveillance program , `` an operation run by gchq , the british intelligence and security organisation , ** used interception warrants ** to monitor phones owned by individuals linked to the plot '' . 
  see there ? 
  keyword is warrants , you can spy on individuals as much as you like ** if you get a warrant ** , but not without one . 
  maybe i live in a bubble ( after all , i live in timisoara , which has the second highest gdp per capita after bucharest ) but i do n't see that much poverty . 
  sure , there are gypsy beggars and people living on welfare , but that kind of stuff you find in pretty much every city on this planet . 
  - we have two giant shopping malls and they 're always packed , on saturdays you are lucky if you can find a parking place after half an hour driving around the parking lot . 
  - there are also many tourism agencies littering the city and they never seem to be short of customers . 
  - the cars you see driving around are not much different than in western european countries , except for the higher prevalence of dacia logan ( it is our national car , after all ) . 
  however , a beaten up old dacia is a rare sight these days , unlike in ukraine or russia for example , where you can still see plenty of old ladas .
