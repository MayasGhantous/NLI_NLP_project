  this is obviously extremely unsustainable , and if we were to modernize our agriculture , we first have to agree we ca n't keep 30 % of our workforce in an area that only generates 4 % of gdp ( a figure that is decreasing every year ) , but the main problem is that these people have zero skills that could be usable in any other field . 
  that 's why the parliament/government are pushing this law , because even if does n't make economic sense for supermarkets to buy expensive produce from romanian farmers , they want to force them to , so as to maintain those low unemployment figures . 
  we do have those already , they 're called farmers ' markets . 
  fighting is not the same as dying . 
  no one is asking them to become suicide bombers or anything . 
  sure , cowards exist and have always existed in every country , but when a country of 45 mil . 
  people ca n't even get 100k military aged men to support the war effort , it becomes clear that it 's not just cowardice . 
  could you imagine the us , russia or britain having manpower problems if they got attacked by a foreign power ? 
  as / u/abidasiii pointed out , even croatia , a country 10 times smaller than ukraine in terms of population , managed to mobilize more people than ukraine . 
  i would n't worry about it that much . 
  neither putin , nor erdogan are men of their of their word . 
  this alliance will be very fragile and will only last as long as putin and erdogan will stay out of each other 's way . 
  putin is an alpha male type , erdogan is a wan na be alpha male type and people like these ca n't mix for too long . 
  ukraine ca n't pull a croatia for a few different reasons : - it 's poorer than croatia was even in 1995 . 
  war needs money ; - it 's more corrupt than croatia ever was . 
  they have a ton of moles in every sector , the ukrainian army ca n't make a single move without the russians finding out , who in turn , would give that intel to the separatists ; - ukraine does n't have a strong national identity . 
  most people just want the war to end somehow and military age men are trying to avoid ending up on the frontline in any possible way ; - russia is a much more powerful enemy for ukraine than serbia ever was for croatia ;, 
  yup , romania has a lot of crime , it 's almost as dangerous as canada . 
   wow so what exactly do they hunt with that ak 47 shown in the video ? 
  rabbits ? 
  that 's a modified ak legal for civilian use . 
  it does n't have full auto capability , it ca n't even use the 30 round mag , just with 10 rounds . 
  it was a modified ak for civilian use . 
  take romania for example : petre roman , former pm . 
  bogdan olteanu , former president of the chamber of deputies , vice-governor of the romanian central bank frank timi\u0219 , once the richest romanian , also among the richest australians ( as he also has australian citizenship ) , kick-started his career as a low level weed and heroin dealer , now the mastermind behind several controversial businesses in both romania as well as africa . 
  elan schwartzenberg , another fine specimen , businessman , media mogul , currently in hiding because he is wanted by the police for giving some bribes . 
  in russia , the situation is even more obvious : mikhail fridman , viktor velkselberg , leonid mikhelson , pyotr aven , arkady rotenberg ( the guy whose company is in charge of building the kerch strait bridge ) , alexey miller ( ceo of gazprom ) , and these are just some of the guys with obviously jewish names , i 'm sure there are a lot more . 
  all these men are very powerful within russia and beyond , none are nobodies . 
  you do realize every european country including russia has some jews cleverly placed very close to the top which means they could n't fuck with israel without some serious consequences , right ? 
  anyway , imho what 's between israel and palestine is between israel and palestine , we should n't have any business telling them what to do , especially considering that israel is the only non-retarded country in the middle east . 
  those are some flimsy looking houses , i do n't know why they even bothered with the bulldozer , two guys with sledgehammers would have been enough . 
  that being said , why are we even funding this shit ? 
  israel is the only civilized country in the middle east , surrounded by morons who only dream about jihad , sharia and destroying israel . 
  the eu should support israel as much as it can . 
  what i was thinking about is business . 
  sure , romania gets a lot of eu funds , but those funds pale in comparison to the profits that western european companies are making here . 
  let 's look at some facts : ** some of the biggest companies in my city ** - continental , dr\u00e4xlmaier , hella and siemens . 
  all german companies of course . 
  ** the telecom business ** in romania is split between vodafone ( uk ) , orange ( france ) , telekom ( germany ) and digi ( romania ) . 
  the romanian one is the smallest , of course . 
  ** the retail business ** : lidl ( germany ) , kaufland ( germany ) , metro ( germany ) , billa ( germay ) , penny market ( germany ) , hornbach ( germany ) , obi ( germany ) , auchan ( france ) , carrefour ( france ) , cora ( belgium ) , profi ( originally belgium , now apparently poland ) , baumax ( austria ) , ikea ( sweden ) , selgros ( switzerland ) , mega image ( romania ) , dedeman ( romania ) , mobexpert ( romania ) . 
  ** banking sector ** : bcr ( erste bank , austria ) , raiffeisen ( austria ) , brd ( societe generale , france ) , ing ( netherlands ) , unicredit ( italy ) , bt ( romania ) . 
  the list could go on of course , and most sectors are simply dominated by western european companies that make very nice profits . 
  it is , because having a second language is not the same as speaking a foreign language . 
  learning a foreign language requires some conscious effort , actually lots of it , second languages are learnt naturally , because you speak them inside your family . 
  we also have some one million hungarian speakers and perhaps another million gypsy speakers in romania , but it would be incorrect to say hungarian or gypsy-speak are popular foreign languages in romania , because very few people outside those communities speak those languages . 
  even so , if you count all the american citizens who can speak a language besides english , regardless if it 's a second or foreign language , i seriously doubt it 's more than 25 % , while in europe ( except uk ) that percentage is probably around 50-60 % . 
  you are mixing apples with oranges here mate . 
   i work for a communication software company where knowing dutch , german , spanish , and ** english ** means less than knowing how to write a small application to fetch the weather using a basic api . 
  that 's interesting , because any retard can learn how to write `` a small application to fetch the weather using a basic api '' within , maybe , half an hour , but it takes much more time and effort to learn english than any programming language , perhaps even assembly . 
  and i 'd really like to see how you would read the documentation of some complex library/framework/api or post questions on stackoverflow without speaking english . 
  and do n't give me bullshit on machine transpation , we are still decades , if not centuries away from having machine translation that is even comparable with human translation . 
  america has a bunch of minorities and immigrants who obviously speak their ow languages in addition to english ( or , rather , speak english in addition to their own languages ) . 
  however , excluding the hispanic minority and first/second generation immigrants , not an awful lot of americans speak any language other than english . 
   i 'm romanian and i swear to fucking god , i wish we crumble to death or get attacked by some extremist islamic force . 
  the fact that these weapons end up in isis hands , does not mean they are selling to isis . 
  by the same logic , we can also say the us trained isis , because many of the fsa soldiers trained by the us defected and joined isis . 
  legit arms embargos would at least prevent the escalation of conflicts . 
  yes , people would die anyway , but the more weapons there , the more people die . 
  however , in practice , every arms embargo is godsend for criminal organizations , which make ridiculously large profits . 
  ummm , not . 
  i remember one romanian mayor who bragged about convincing some chinese investors to invest in his town and claimed he communicated with the chinese guys by email using google translate . 
  if you speak chinese well , i doubt you will have a tough time finding a well paid job , especially if this is in addition to other skills . 
  even translators/interpreters are scarce , a friend of mine who went to china told me there were a lot of signs , even in big shopping malls , that looked like they were translated into english using machine translation or a very bad human translator . 
  there are even entire websites/blogs showcasing these shitty translations . 
  correction : those who speak russian rarely speak any other language . 
  russians are very similar to americans in this respect . 
  exactly . 
  if anything , this poll shows support for the eu has dropped considerably in romania , as in 2007 , when we joined , it was like 95 % iirc . 
  i still remember the summer of 2006 , when i went to austria for q couple of months , and thought that after we joined the eu , romania would look just like austria in a decade or so ( in my defense , i was only 15 at the time , and pro-eu propaganda was going into overdrive in romania ) . 
  ten years later , sure , a few things have improved , like the roads are n't as crappy as they used to be , but the differences are still huge and i still get a bit depressed when coming back to romania after spending a few months abroad . 
  assuming putin ever gave a fuck about a dead pilot . 
  tensions with turkey were already high before that and putin just used the opportunity to squeeze erdogan 's balls . 
  now that erdogan apologized for the downing , this leaves putin in his favorite , alpha male position and erdogan will have to make a lot of compromises if he wants putin as his `` friend '' . 
  of course , erdogan would be very stupid to trust putin with anything , he does not have any friends ( at least not outside of russia ) , just momentary allies and vassals . 
  or lower . 
  that 's why i think holding referendums on such issues is a bad idea , because the vast majority of people are extremely short-sighted and such referendums are permanent , you do n't get one every 4 years like with elections . 
  germany profits much more than romania ( and poland ) from the eu . 
  how much you pay vs how much you get back from the eu directly is only a very tiny part of the economic implications of being a member of the eu . 
  money talks . 
  my question , however , is why does ukraine even supply electricity to crimea any more ? 
  it 's basically supplying the enemy at this point . 
  biggest dilemma : is it putler & erdolin or erdler and putlin ? 
   but any committed individual could simply find a rural field , or forest , or lake or whatever and cross with absolutely no trouble . 
  sorry mate , but that 's just bullshit . 
  my cousin works for the border police and they patrol dirt roads round the clock with 4x4s and atvs . 
  they also have both normal , as well as infrared cameras that can show a license plate from miles away . 
  most successful smugglers drive straight through the checkpoints with their shit hidden inside their vehicles , because it 's impossible to thoroughly check every single vehicle that crosses the border without fucking up the economy . 
  smuggling was always a thing , even in communist countries during the cold war which had the tightest border security ever to keep people in and information out , people still managed to escape to western europe by the thousands and any american movie would be available on the black market within weeks of appearing on vcr in the west , uncensored and professionally translated . 
  if these guys are legit ( which i kinda doubt ) , they are completely retarded . 
  i give them one month , two at most before they get caught . 
  it 's not , in romania you get 300 mb/s for $ 5 . 
  moldova complaining about this is so cringy , like someone living in a landfill complaining about a fart . 
  lol , why would latvia want to undermine its national security ? 
  as recent history has proven , giving russian speakers any sorts of special rights is a terrible idea . 
  why would you even give any sorts of rights to people who were brought in specifically to destroy latvian national identity ? 
  they are nothing but unwelcome guests there , they have zero respect for the latvian state , their only allegiance is to mother russia . 
  if they had any respect , they would have learned latvian by now . 
  if they want to become a part of latvian society , they can learn latvian and stop acting like the fifth column . 
  if they do n't want that , then \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d -- \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b -- \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f , i 'm sure they wo n't be missed .
