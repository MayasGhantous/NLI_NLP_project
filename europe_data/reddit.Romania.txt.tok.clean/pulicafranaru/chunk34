  of course brexit was going to be bad for both parties , but dissolving the eu is certainly not the solution , it would maybe solve 10 problems but create 1000 . 
   albania is just as desparate to get in to the eu as uk was to get out , that says something about the state of the union . 
  do you honestly see any expansion of the eu in next 2 + decades ? 
  maybe it 's possible iceland could quietly join at some point , but albania , serbia , bosnia , moldova , ukraine are in for a long wait , that is if they will ever get in . 
  the eu will now have to focus on fixing the problems with the southern countries as well as developing the eastern countries , it simply ca n't afford to take any new poor countries at this point . 
  exactly , the entire leave campaign stood on the false assumption that when britain would leave the eu , the eu would simply get on its knees and suck britain 's dick . 
  the only shocking thing is that there where so many people who actually bought this . 
  for any sort of negotiation , the benefits and obligations of both parties usually need to be as balanced as possible and when they are unbalanced , they tend to be unbalanced in favor of the big guy . 
  the only britain could have benefited from leaving the eu is if they then had to negotiate 27 different deals with 27 states , but in reality they have to negotiate one deal that must satisfy all 27 states , or at least the almost all of them . 
  theoretically , a deal could be struck if 20 states that had more than 65 % of eu population would agree to it , but in practice the eu would not agree to a deal that does n't satisfy at least 25-26 of those states , because then it would only have more erosion . 
  both the uk and the eu will be under immense pressure to get a deal tilted heavily towards their own interests , but the eu simply has a lot more leverage . 
   british people would still be able to live , travel , study and buy homes on the continent but the same rights would not be automatically extended to eu citizens in the uk , he wrote . 
  britain would also be freed from sending `` a substantial sum of money '' to the eu budget , which he said `` could '' be used for the nhs . 
  lol , keep on dreamin ' boris . 
   am i really the only remainer who thinks the government should have had a plan ? 
  there were only two possible outcomes , it 's total incompetence not to have a plan . 
  well , cameron did have a plan , and that plan was to reign and leave the brexiters to deal with the shitstorm . 
  it 's what any smart person would have done . 
  well , it was cameron who promised the referendum and held it , you have to admit , it was pretty dumb on his side , risking his entire country to score some points in an internal party battle . 
  yeah , but orthodox priests do n't travel in pleb cars . 
  yeah , you 're right , i do n't . 
  what does it mean ? 
  iirc , the pro-russians also washed the streets after they paraded ukrainian pows through donetsk ( or was it luhansk , ca n't remember ? ) . 
  is this some kind of pan-slavic tradition ? 
  oh , gosh , first some far right leaders who enthusiastically started calling for their countries to leave the eu ( which was totally unexpected / s ) , now a random mep from ireland , i 'm sure you can find politicians in every eu country that would want to leave the eu , does n't make it a mainstream view . 
  oh my god , european politics are looking even worse than romanian ones at this time . 
  something that a random guy from the cdu or even schauble says is completely irrelevant , any agreement with the uk will have to be agreed upon by at least 20 member states with 65 % of the population , but considering the fact that the eu probably does n't want to lose any other member states it will have to be agreed upon by all 27 member states and everyone will want their slice of the pie . 
  everything said before formal negotiations actually start is pure speculation . 
  well yeah , but all of britain 's illegal immigrants come from outside the eu , so it 's a moot point . 
  britain complaining about illegal immigrants from the eu is as ridiculous as california complaining it has illegal immigrants from the us . 
  [ yup , this is fine . 
   if this was indeed plastered by a hungarian went to their website :  csipkeszeg foundation yeah ... 
  it 's a hungarian butthurt by the treaty of trianon , it 's pretty obvious , you can tell by the welsh sign and the cluj sign . 
  the welsh sign is written in both english and welsh , while the cluj sign had the hungarian version spray painted over with graffiti . 
  so he 's implying the british people respect the welsh , while romania is some fascist country oppressing the poor hungarians , as if someone with a brain would judge an entire country because of some idiot who spray-painted a bilingual sign , lol . 
  do n't worry , every romanian would recognize from a mile away that it was made by a butthurt hungarian . 
  no one would blame the dutch for this . 
  just some butthurt hungarian , just making a fool of himself , nothing to see here really . 
  farage was delighted because he knows ukip is the only party to benefit from a leave in the end . 
  he knows boris wo n't be able to keep his promises , ukip will only win votes , regardless of whether the uk gets an eea deal , does n't get any deal or does n't leave the eu at all . 
  reunification is not realistically going to happen in our life time , unless something really extraordinary happens , like russia collapsing or joining the eu or something . 
  neither romanian , nor moldovan politicians have shared any realistic plans for how reunification would actually work , for the past 25 years it 's been just the same old nationalistic bullshit that brings tears into people 's eyes and wins votes . 
  the latest retarded idea being thrown around by some politicians from both countries is unification until 2018 , because by then it will be 100 years since the unification in 1918 . 
  ofc it 's not going to happen , but nationalist idiots still hope it will . 
  schauble is not powerful enough to decide , however , if britain does get any kind of deal , it will be overall shittier than what it has today . 
   boris should go crawling back and apologise for being a twat , then have to humiliate himself by coming back here and telling us all what we already know - that it is n't a good idea to leave . 
  well , boris right now is lubricating his ass for what 's about to come . 
  of course he knows it would be best to back off and stay in the eu , after all , this referendum was supposed to be just a coup against cameron , neither boris , nor anyone else in the official leave campaign actually expected leave to win . 
  by `` winning '' , they in fact lost , they 're now making themselves look like fools and cameron looking like the reasonable guy . 
  they 're saying it 's no hurry to trigger article 50 , but in reality they mean they would never want to trigger article 50 , however it 's not completely up to them right now . 
  he 's the romanian version of a ukip voter . 
  safe to ignore . 
  you can work in it , the sector is booming and it employees do n't have to pay income tax . 
  average salary for people working in it is around $ 24000 which might not seem like a lot , but keep in mind romanian prices are much lower than in britain . 
  however , you need to have some experience to get that salary , if you are a junior developer , you can only hope at $ 600-1000 per month . 
   i mean tehnically we are up for it , even with the economical sacrifices . 
  if we wanted to prove to the world we are dumber than the brexiters we could hold a referendum on unification . 
  you only need to look at the german unification , west germany has been basically showering the east with money ever since unification and the east is still far behind . 
  and you wan na know the worst part ? 
  the economic gap between east and west germany was actually smaller before unification than the gap between moldova and romania . 
  we would basically be pouring money into a black hole for decades just to bring moldova to vaslui levels of development . 
  not to mention there are huge levels of violent crime in moldova and large numbers of weapons , every fucking 16 year old gopnik has photos with real , loaded , undeclared makarov pistols and ak-47s . 
   it 's tehnically them that stop the unification from happening , not us :p lol , like anyone ever gave a fuck about what the moldovans think . 
  romania could easily anschluss moldova if it really wanted to , but no rational politician would do it , because it would be like the stupidest decision ever . 
   i do n't think we face the same problems , most of our external inmigration is from central / south america and they integrate extremely well for the most part , the first generation are basically darker spaniards already . 
  well , a lot of britain 's immigrants come from the commonwealth , so i guess they already speak english when they get there . 
  the brits are simply distant and cold as fuck , of course foreigners do n't integrate well , how the hell are they supposed to integrate if they ca n't make many native friends ? 
   the gipsies ... not so much . 
  no one has ever been able to integrate them , from nazis/antonescu who burned them in ovens/deported them to transnistria to ceausescu who tried to force them to go to school and make them work . 
  everything failed . 
  if the most extreme regimes that ever existed could n't integrate/get rid of them , a modern liberal democracy obviously stands no chance , lol . 
   we do n't have to follow eu laws meaning we get rid of things like open borders . 
  did you even read the fucking article ? 
  i do n't understand where this open borders bullshit comes from , the uk does n't have and never had open borders as it 's not part of the schengen area . 
  what it does have is free movement of people , which means eu ** citizens ** can go to the uk , work , study , do whatever the fuck they want and obviously britons can do the same in other eu states . 
  this is precisely what boris said will ** not ** end . 
  so essentially there will be no change to immigration unless they put harsher restrictions on non-eu migration , but it was n't necesary to leave the eu in order to do that . 
  the only things that will change is the uk will get a few extra bones , like being able to limit eu immigrants ' access to welfare benefits , control over its fishing and agricultural industries and some others , but the price it will pay for this is that it will no longer have a say in the eu . 
  tl ; dr : if you think poles , lithuanians and romanians are going home or that it will be more difficult for others to come , boris has basically just said - `` yeah , not gon na happen '' . 
  yeah , but britain takes in a lot of non-eu migration which it does n't have to . 
  from 2013 to 2014 , something like 500.000 immigrants arrived in britain , but only around 200.000 were from the eu , most came from third countries . 
  also people who come from the eu tend to be more mobile , a plane ticket from london to warsaw is like # 50 or something . 
  someone coming from pakistan or india on the other hand is coming to stay ... also , spain has more foreign born people per capita than the uk , they 're also much poorer , but you do n't hear the spanish whining all the time about immigration , do you ? 
  no he 's not talking about visas , he 's not stupid enough to think the eu will allow free market access without free movement of people . 
  he 's just preparing the leavers for a norway type deal , which would turn the uk into the eu 's butch for no good reason and he will then sell it to the public like a major victory , but in reality the only thing that will change will be that the uk will get a few extra bones but lose a whole lot of influence . 
   i think the uk is in a relatively strong position . 
  why ? 
  because we 're a relatively rich nation . 
  germany 's biggest customer in europe is the uk . 
  we 're a nation of over 60 million . 
  we buy a lot . 
  yeah , only problem is that 16 % of eu exports go to britain but 50 % of uk exports go to the eu . 
  not to mention the uk has a huge trade deficit , so it will be in the more desperate position . 
  even if no deal is made , trade will continue with wto tariffs , i 'm sure the brits will continue to buy eu goods regardless , but can you be certain europeans will continue to buy british stuff if it will become more expensive ? 
  they probably will , but the drop in eu imports from the uk will likely be more dramatic than the drop in eu exports to the uk . 
  both sides lose , but the british lose more . 
   as for the banks leaving london ... well you see the issue is this . . there 's an issue with language . 
  sure german and french bankers can speak english , but it 's just not that same . 
  just ... lol . 
  it 's one of the stupidest things i 've heard these days .
