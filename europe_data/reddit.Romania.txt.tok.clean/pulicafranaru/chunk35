  this language thing you 're talking about is the last thing bankers give a fuck about . 
  they can only trade eu securities if they are trading inside the eu . 
  once britain gets out , they will only be able to trade eu securities , but you can be sure they will move their operations way before that happens . 
  it would be like nyc seceding from the us , do you think wall street would survive ? 
  as i said , this language thing is the last thing on their mind , if you think they give the slightest fuck if their employees speak english with a british or french/german accent , you are delusional . 
   i also think there will be further referendums within europe . 
  the shitstorm that will follow brexit will make sure no one will be thinking about holding such a referendum for a long , long time . 
  other countries are way more integrated in europe than britain is , effects on their economies would be even more devastating than it 's going to be in britain . 
  radical populists like wilders and le pen are calling for referendums asap because they know the longer they wait , the more apparent it will become that getting out of the eu is a stupid idea and their ratings will go down . 
   developed country 's in the top tier and developing countries in the second . 
  lol , and what good would that do ? 
  there have been talks about a two-speed europe , but not based on such a simplistic view over which country is developed and which is not . 
  for example greece has a higher gni per capita than slovakia , but the slovak economy is obviously in much better shape . 
  our politicians do , but only around national holidays , they make a trip to chisinau , make the same old boring speeches about unification they 've been doing for the past 25 years , then they fly back to bucharest and it 's back to business as usual . 
  a couple of weeks ago moldova asked us to patrol their airspace , romanian government has n't responded yet , they 'll probably wait a bit before saying `` lol , no '' . 
   `` we want to offer our ** czech and hungarian partners ** to create a joint assembly not only in the format of four countries but including ukraine and romania '' , said kuchcinski . 
  but what about slovakia , did they get anschlussed by the czechs ? 
  \u00d6xit would be even more retarded than brexit . 
  austria is way more dependent on the eu than britain , it 's also landlocked , if britain is jumping into the unknown , austria would be headed straight for a concrete block . 
  i 'm sure the french would love that idea , but i 'm 99 % sure it wo n't happen . 
  also , english will continue to be an official language of the eu , because ireland is still a member , and i 'm pretty sure it would continue to be even if ireland left as well . 
  as a side note , did your politicians stop speaking russian when you left the ussr ? 
  can you give me any other argument than `` experts get it wrong all the time '' ? 
  yes , experts do get it wrong often , because human behavior is not accurately predictable . 
  but you know who gets it wrong a lot more often than experts ? 
  it 's politicians with no long-term vision , they ** always ** get it wrong . 
  now , it 's clear that boris and his acolytes do n't have a plan , because if they did , they would have shared it with us by now . 
  all you hear from them right now is `` no immediate change '' , `` no hurry '' , `` markets will get back to normal '' etc. 
  these are simply code words for `` we 're fucked , we have no idea what we 've gotten ourselves into and no idea what we 're gon na do '' , but of course , no politician has the balls to say that . 
  they also find [ shit like that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsjqmjxg86q ) here all the time , especially when there 's works involving digging . 
  it 's scary , many are found very close to big buildings . 
  can someone give me a tl ; dr summary of the political situation in spain ( which parties are running , what are their views , the relations between them and who 's most likely to win and form government ) ? 
  you know , this whole brexit thing basically overshadowed all other discussions in the last few days . 
   because for the next 2 years , nothing is going to change . 
  so naive ... do you even know how the economy works ? 
  even if stuff does n't change on paper for next 2 years , it does n't mean it wo n't change in the real world . 
  those 2 years ( or perhaps even more ) until a final deal is signed will be of huge uncertainty . 
  no one knows how things are going to turn out , so many investors will avoid britain . 
  financial institutions will be pulling out of london soon enough , they do n't want to be caught with their pants down . 
  the pound will continue to be volatile , it will jump up or down every time cameron , boris , juncker , merkel or some other important important person opens their mouth . 
  many manufacturing businesses will move out of britain in fear that labour costs are going to rise if eu migrants are no longer allowed to work . 
  it 's not a `` forecast '' , it 's simply what happens during times of uncertainty . 
  with a possible nexit looming on the horizon ? 
  i would n't be so sure ... i mean , nexit is probably not going to happen , but maybe companies would want to rather be safe than sorry . 
  if you have any savings , it 's probably the best time to invest in real estate . 
  no , i think you 're leaving in an alternate universe where brexit still looks like a good idea . 
  it 's not even 3 days since the referendum result and the politicians who were on the supposedly `` winning '' side are already coming up with a ton of excuses . 
  if you still do n't see this as an early indication of how bad things are going to get , then i guess you will still think it was a great idea to leave the eu even after you have lost your job , had your house foreclosed and see your country split in half . 
   he said on radio show `` you would never live next to a romanian '' yeah , i remember that , he was probably thinking about himself , i can fully understand why he would n't want to live next door to a romanian , but the feeling is mutual , i 'm sure no romanian would want to live next door to farage either . 
  if farage were to move next door to me , i would be pretty pissed . 
  if they wanted to leave the eu , then it 's only logical they would like to see it dissolved , because then they could get bilateral agreements with individual countries , because they 'd have way more leverage when negotiating with small countries rather than negotiating with a huge bloc they just left . 
  they do n't say it openly though because they know they 'll have to conduct tough negotiations with the eu and saying things like this would only worsen their position because who the hell would want to negotiate with someone who openly says he would like to see the entity you represent being destroyed ? 
   farage is their vadim . 
  while i agree you ca n't judge the whole country based on what farage says , farage is not vadim , he 's much smarter than vadim ever was . 
  also , vadim was as mainstream as farage for only a short period of time , farage has been mainstream for quite a few years now and by the way it looks he will only become even more mainstream in the future . 
   haha , that is why we are a net contributor that helps prop up countries like romania ... oh , god , i 'm already tired about this argument . 
  first of all , romania is n't poland , we do n't have fucking 99 % absorption rates so not all the money the eu allocates to romania are actually spent by romania . 
  until recent years , romania 's absorption rates were ridiculously low . 
  even today , eu funds barely exceed 1 % of gdp , something like $ 100 per capita or some other ridiculous figure like that . 
  and the uk share in all those eu funds is not as large , even if the uk stops paying any money to the eu , the reduction in available eu funds would n't affect us that much , because , as i said earlier , we do n't have very high absorption rates anyway . 
  also , if you 've been following / r/europe over the past two years , you know there 's a huge anti-corruption crusade in romania , and the sums involved are n't small , we can make a lot more money by cracking down on corruption than the eu could ever give us . 
  now , not to say i 'm not grateful for the money my country receives from the eu , but i find it insulting when so many western europeans assume we only like the eu because of money , whether directly , from eu funds , or indirectly , by being be free to work wherever in the eu . 
  while i 'm not going to deny many easterners ( and southerners ) feel this way , a lot of europeans who like the eu , do so because it allows them to feel like a part of something larger , an european identity that transcends the old borders that never brought anything good . 
  the brits never felt this way , you always wanted to have your own thing with the commonwealth et co. and it 's not just the leavers , i 'm sure a lot of remainers feel this way , they just voted in because they were scared the economy would go to shit . 
  if this is not true , then please tell me , why was n't eu symbolism used in the remain campaign ? 
  do you think this was accidental ? 
  i do n't think so , i think this is proof brits in general do n't feel european at all , so using eu symbolism in the remain campaign would have been considered intrusive , that 's why they preferred to use union jack exclusively . 
   there 's no f * cking way you can know that uk supported eu expansion `` to slow down integration '' ... and why would they do that ? 
  they had an opt-out on the integration , they did n't need to play silly games to stop everybody else . 
  getting an opt-out was not enough . 
  pretty much the entire pre-2004 eu either joined the eurozone ( most countries ) , were ( and still are ) obliged to join when convergence criteria is met ( sweden ) or had its currency pegged to the euro ( denmark ) . 
  the odd one out ? 
  the uk and ... no one else . 
  even before the euro , there was schengen . 
  again everyone joined until 2001 , except for the uk and roi ( who obviously did n't join because it had its thing with ni . 
  so the uk was pretty much isolated in an eu dominated by germany and france . 
  that 's why they wanted eu expansion , they knew it would dilute german-french dominance and the eastern countries had no chance of integrating with the rest of the eu quickly , as they were at the time much poorer than even the southern countries . 
  so , by promoting eastward expansion , the uk hoped the eu would revert back to a simple trade bloc with a bunch of new markets for them . 
  they also expected the new eu members to suck britain 's dick for promoting their inclusion . 
  of course , when this backfired and hundreds of thousands of poles and lithuanians starting going to the uk , they went back to the usual euroscepticism , plus a whole new anti-immigration stance , that by the time romania and bulgaria joined , they used up every legal option to extend restrictions as long as they could , until 2014 ( they would have extended the restrictions well beyond 2014 if they had any legal option to do so ) . 
  my point is simple , britain not only did not want to be a part of a united europe , it never wanted a united europe in the first place . 
  and they do n't want it now , either , farage is very open about his support for the dissolution of the eu and i 'm sure all pro-leave politicians are , they just do n't say it openly like farage . 
   gb has up to 300 nukes and makes good part of european second strike capability . 
  mr. putin is that you ? 
  also , you need to figure out what will become of all those nukes when scotland leaves the uk , you will be essentially castrated . 
  you 're also in the schengen area , so if an illegal migrant can get to italy , there 's little stopping them from getting to norway , really . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  eu citizens can work in norway just as easily as they can work in britain , no work permits or point system or anything like that . 
  norway is also a part of the schengen area . 
  exactly , if they have such massive oil reserves , i doubt scotland would be willing to let the english exploit them . 
  it 's * masseneinwanderungsinitiative * , not * masseneinwanderungsintiative * , you forgot an i in there . 
   you 've been crying throughout this whole thread . 
  i 'm not crying , lol , i 'm happy they 're leaving . 
  it 's gon na be one hell of a shitshow . 
   you 're losing handouts and will need to stand on your own two feet . 
  i never received any handouts , not from the eu , nor from anyone else . 
  i earn enough money to live comfortably , but thanks for your concern . 
  [ yup ] ( http://time.com/4381612/uk-brexit-google-what-is-the-eu/ ), 
   the poor people of romania are already known for poverty and a corrupt political system . 
  just because we have a smaller economy does not mean major economic problems .
