  the price of oil has barely been down for year , do n't worry , it will go up again . 
  such short-sighteness , no wonder you are pro-brexit , if scotland were to secede , do you imagine they would hold the referendum on monday , leave the uk by wednesday and join the eu on friday ? 
  if scotland will hold such a referendum , the conditions then will already be very different than they are today , with the effects of brexit in full swing over the uk economy , creating the proper conditions for the scottish people to say `` fuck no '' to a crumbling uk . 
  same thing could be said about those who voted to leave , you do n't know how many voted to leave because they actually hate the eu , and how many voted to leave because they bought lies ( like the 350 million a week being used for the nhs ) , or because they had a completely distorted and false view of the eu ( like it being the eu 's fault that muslims come to britain ) , or because they were just angry at the system , and people angry at the british leadership ( cameron , for instance ) , people who are against `` the system '' typically vote against everything `` the system '' endorses . 
  also , do not forget conspiratards . 
  still , farage would surely proclaim the death of uk democracy and urge people to vote for him , their savior , from the weak conservatives who have been bullied by the eu bureaucrats to stay . 
  a lot of people would vote for him , because they still would n't know how a britain outside the eu would look like . 
  the only way the uk could stay without a third of conservative party members deserting to ukip and the rest tearing itself apart would be for the eu to give massive compromises to britain to make it stay , which is simply never going to happen . 
  i just do n't see how it could happen . 
  it would make the tories look extremely bad . 
  like ** extremely ** bad . 
  imagine boris becoming prime minister and saying `` oh , you know we 're not gon na leave the eu after all , because we realized it will fuck our economy and split our country apart '' . 
  not only would he be killing his political career , but also destroy the conservative party . 
  even if a a couple of million leave voters change their mind and prefer to ultimately stay in the eu after all , the other 15 or million will be very pissed , and you 'll have farage stepping on the stage , saying :  oh , look , the uk has just turned into a bloody dictatorship !, 
  the conservatives have been bullied by evil eu bureaucrats to keep the uk inside the eu superstate against the will of the british people !, 
  save uk democracy while you still can !, 
  vote ukip !, 
  there would be millions who would feel betrayed , in addition to leavers even some people who did n't vote , or even some remainers would feel pissed that a democratic vote was ignored and they would instantly buy farage 's rhetoric . 
  and if farage would become pm , not only would he extricate the uk from the eu , he would do everything in his power to compromise the entire eu project , because he knows it 's the only way he can negotiate different deals with the rich , western and northern countries than with the poorer southern and eastern countries . 
  the only way britain can turn around and not leave the eu without british politicians killing their careers , would be for the eu to fundamentally change to accommodate brexiters , like abandoning eu financed projects ( so that britain does n't have to pay all that money to the eu budget ) and abandoning the free movement of people ( so those pesky poles and romanians ca n't `` invade '' the uk anymore ) and there 's simply no way the eu would in a million years agree to something like that . 
  guess he missed that class where he was supposed to learn how the eea works . 
  unfortunately , the deed is done , turning around right now would do more damage than good , the british have only themselves and the leave politicians who lied to them to blame . 
  britain backpedaling on leaving the eu is the last thing we need right now , it would make ukip 's ratings go through the roof . 
   he 's talking between mainland uk and ireland . 
  but keep circlejerking on how leave are dumb etc. . . 
  both cameron and johnson have said there wo n't be any immediate change to the free flow of people between the uk and the ** entire eu ** . 
  of course , what happens next remains to be seen , both between the uk and the eu in general , as well as between the uk and ireland in particular . 
  sorry , on mobile , so did n't see the flair . 
  you should definitely put a / s after such comments , i 'm sure there are many brexiters who would say shit like this and actually believe it . 
   what are their feelings towards the uk ? 
  most people do n't really care much , except for those who work or have relatives working in the uk . 
  they are scared about future prospects , but not really in a hurry to pack their bags . 
  some of my friends told me they might be coming home , others have suggested they might look for work in other countries . 
   what are their feelings about the european union now ? 
  their positions were generally strengthen slightly . 
  people who were pro-eu are now even more pro-eu and people who were eurosceptic are now even more eurosceptic . 
   overall how has brexit been received ? 
  pretty much all of the mainstream media and politicians condemned it . 
   how aware of the scottish reaction to the result and are they supportive/unsupportive if they know . 
  not very aware , and those who are tend to be neutral . 
   do you personally feel that brexit is good or bad in the longer term for the eu ? 
  i think it 's a tough test for the eu . 
  it can go both ways , the eu could either re-emerge from this even stronger and with renewed confidence , or it could crumble and die . 
  obviously , i sincerely hope the first option is true , but i 'm not entirely confident . 
   phew , checkmate all you remain voters with your doomsday scenarios !, 
  this still makes brexiters look even more stupid . 
  it would be like giving up your seat on the board of directors of a company , but still remaining a regular employee . 
  why would you do that ? 
  there is no guarantee that either the eu , nor the next british government will accept such a deal . 
  after all , for the eu it could be a sign to member states that leaving can be painless , giving a huge confidence boost to eurosceptics . 
  for the uk brexit government , this would be in full contradiction with their `` take back control of our country '' narrative . 
  there would have to be a huge compromise on both sides for that to work , and i do n't think boris and juncker can be the men to make it happen . 
  i do n't think it would be a good idea to do this right now , as it will further the ideological gap between countries which are more federalist and those which are more eurosceptic . 
  what happens if the referendum passes by majority vote in one direction , but people in some countries vote overwhelmingly in the other direction ? 
  we would experience the same fuckery the uk is experiencing now with the rift between england + wales and london + scotland + northern ireland . 
  it would be a disaster of epic proportions . 
  so , just please , no more stupid referendums in the near future . 
  not everything would have to be centralized . 
  it could just be the defense , foreign and monetary policies , as well as border control the federal government 's responsibility , while everything else could be the responsibility of the individual member states . 
  except from certain safeguards to ensure individual member states do n't run crazy deficits , each state could still have the economic policies that work best for it . 
  although , i do agree , we should definitely work a lot to reduce the economic differences between individual countries before we can make this project feasible . 
  we will have our european federation with blackjack and hookers and you wo n't be invited . 
  of course it 's not going to end , the eu wo n't even put this on the negotiation table if britain wants to get an even remotely decent deal and avoid financial meltdown.even with all the backpedalling , it 's likely that britain will be irreversibly damaged by this whole circus , as will be the credibility of the entire british political class . 
  i kind of like verhofstadt , he seems pretty passionate about what he 's doing , about the entire eu , unlike most meps who only seem to care about either just their big salaries and benefits or to score political points in their own countries . 
   while living in west europe and seeing the constant outflow of people out of romania into west europe i have to ask myself : are you already fucked in romania big time in romania or why are so many people leaving romania ? 
  there is no such `` constant outflow '' , just because there are many romanians moving around in europe does n't mean they all come from romania , many actually were already immigrants in countries like italy and spain and are now moving to richer countries because of the lack of opportunities there . 
  most do n't even move permanently , a lot go and work in the west for a couple of years and come back after realizing its not quite the dream they imagined . 
  a plane ticket from bucharest to london or any other major european city is around like $ 60 on average , so not quite a fortune . 
  also , migration goes both way , there are around 10.000 italian citizens in my city alone , yet no one imagines italy is so fucked italians have to come to romania to survive , it 's just normal movement of people , they move around because they can and i think this is a good thing . 
   p.s i 'm not from the uk . 
  the uk will handle this and on the long run they are better off outside because ( in case you still cant see it ) : the eu is in a process of decay . 
  no ideological background can ignore reality ... well it can but the awakening will be rude . 
  keep your head in the sand if you want . 
  and it 's really amazing that you , as a citizen of an east european country with its history in the sowjet realm , can not see the obvious problems with the eu . 
  i 'm assuming that you are part of the younger generation . 
  eu is in a process of decay because it needs serious reform , not to be dissolved . 
  is there any legitimate reason why we ca n't have an eu that is more democratic and accountable to it 's fucking citizens , rather than governments with petty national interests ? 
  of course not , but as europe never learns from history , of course it 's the extremists ( both left and right ) that people look to . 
   and it 's really amazing that you , as a citizen of an east european country with its history in the sowjet realm , can not see the obvious problems with the eu . 
  i 'm assuming that you are part of the younger generation . 
  if we 're talking about the eastern bloc , it 's not even comparable with the eu , it was a bureaucratic nightmare just to travel from one commie country to another , let alone from a commie country to a western country . 
  if we talk about the soviet union , it did fail because it had an autocratic government , but which country benefited from its disintegration , because all except the resource rich states and the baltics ( which immediately moved to make agreements with the eu and later join it ) are much worse off . 
  the eu does n't have any terribly resource rich states , nor any country that can remain competitive on a global scale alone , because the bric countries + some others will overshadow even germany in a few decades . 
   i 'm assuming that you are part of the younger generation . 
  you are correct . 
  i also travel a lot and have friends in many countries and i do n't think the young generation who is mostly globalist and outward looking should get locked inside their countries of birth because of some old , nationalistic , closed minded , xenophobic , backward looking twats , and this is not an attack on western countries , we have many such specimens here as well , possibly even more than in we , they are just more closeted . 
  it 's only been a day and the situation is already looking grim . 
  with every news article it only starts looking worse . 
  it is also becoming very apparent the leave camp never really had a plan . 
  there 's simply no realistic way this could go well . 
   i 'm afraid , to appease not only the leavers but also neutralize euroskeptics in other countries as well . 
  for example remove the european council , make the european commission electable , give the european parliament the power to repeal legislation i would completely agree with that , but the problem is i can already see individual governments whining about removing the european council and making commissioners electable . 
  for example orban , do you see him willingly renounce his seat at the european council table ? 
  he would instantly start bitching about how foreign powers want to take over hungary . 
  other european leaders would probably do the same . 
  the reason european institutions are so shitty is because member states made them so . 
  they apparently could n't agree on anything more democratic than the current clusterfuck . 
  hopefully , the realization that they have brought the eu on the verge of collapse will make them seriously start thinking about how to make the whole thing more democratic and accountable . 
   and increase external border security , none of this assgrabbing with turkey , actual border security where european men and women ensure that our borders are secure . 
  all this migrant fuckery is completely the fault of merkel , acting like she 's running the eu , even though no one gave her a mandate to do so .
