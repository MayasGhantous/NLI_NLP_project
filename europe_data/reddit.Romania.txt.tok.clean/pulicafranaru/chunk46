  the real question is , will he be deported ? 
  oh , a russian os endorsed by the russian govt . 
  let 's face it , the main reason they want this is surveillance . 
  - google , facebook , apple can decide what info they provide to the fsb . 
  requests are also handled on an individual basis , thus making mass surveillance by the fsb impractical through these services . 
  a russian os will surely come bundled with all the russian apps , yandex , vk , mail.ru etc. 
  i 'm more than certain the fsb has the ssl keys to all these services , making surveillance trivial . 
  if you use these services , you can be fairly certain that the fsb will have access to all your emails , search and browser history , instant messages , location data and dick pics at the click of a button . 
  how long they will store all of these only depends on the capacity of their data centers . 
  i do n't know how well developed the fsb 's data center networks are , but i assume they 're able to keep a complete internet buffer for at least a week , with selective data probably being stored for decades . 
  - you can also be certain they will be backdoored , not only on the software level , but also on the hardware level . 
  finding hardware backdoors is trickier than it sounds , apple even had it 's engineers take photographs of its servers ' motherboards and annotate each chip and what it was supposed to do . 
  they are so paranoid about this they even started designing their own servers for this reason . 
  if apple is susceptible to backdoored hardware , think about the average consumer . 
  huawei and zte were also caught backdooring their wireless antennas . 
  you have to be extremely naive to think a russian phone with a russian os endorsed by the russian government wo n't be compromised from the start . 
   they will be used after romania will join schengen . 
  ** if ** romania will ever join schengen . 
  even if we do , by the time we will join , they will probably have to be resurfaced . 
  i do n't think it 's a good idea to join schengen now , anyway . 
   romania can into schengen ? 
  romania has a difficult history with schengen , after it joined the eu in 2007 , it invested heavily to upgrade its border security with ukraine , moldova and serbia . 
  initially , it was supposed to join in 2011 , all reports were positive and it was given the green light by the eu . 
  the problem was that with schengen , just like with the eu , individual countries have veto rights . 
  so the netherlands started bitching about the justice in romania and bulgaria and said they should only be allowed to join once the monitoring for justice is lifted . 
  this was pretty arbitrary , because lifting the monitoring for justice was never a condition to join schengen . 
  then , the german interior minister started bitching . 
  at some point france and finland bitched , but for a short while . 
  france was butthurt because romania decided to use canadian technology to upgrade its cernavoda nuclear power station and finland i do n't know why , guess they just wanted to feel relevant . 
  but those were minor impediments , the main assholes in this story are germany and the netherlands . 
  when romania finally got around to fixing its justice problems and reports became more and more positive , the netherlands started bitching about bulgaria and because both countries are supposed to join schengen at the same time , the problems in bulgaria also prevent romania from joining . 
  decoupling romania from bulgaria so that it can join schengen would require complex bureaucratic procedures and bulgaria is obviously against it , because they would be left behind . 
  - eu commissioner for regional policy , corina cre\u021bu sent a letter to romanian pm , dacian ciolo\u0219 , demanding the romanian government to take measures which would open these roads for traffic . 
  - the pm responded by saying the functioning of these roads ultimately depends on romania joining schengen . 
  opening these roads for traffic would require building schengen compliant border crossings , which are expensive and unjustifiable , since they would become pointless as soon as romania would join schengen . 
  for example , the border crossing between the hungarian m43 and the romanian a1 motorways had cost almost $ 7 million and despite it being used by both romanian and hungarian border police and customs , it was built and paid for entirely by romania . 
  - romania has been successively blocked from joining schengen , mainly by germany and the netherlands , despite meeting all the requirements for membership since 2011 . 
  i doubt that . 
  hungary already gets cheap gas from russia , and an $ 200 mil . 
  contract is n't that big . 
  to me , it smells like corruption , and considering russia is one of the most corrupt countries on the planet , i would n't be surprised if they bribed some officials to win the tender . 
  the fact that fidesz is very friendly towards russia also helped them , probably . 
  [ they did . 
  this is cool . 
  how does it work ? 
  how accurate is it ? 
  well , they could take down the mercedes sign and replace it with a portrait of erdogan . 
  of course it looks like the liberty bridge , it was built by pretty much the same people . 
  it was also blown up by the nazis back in ww2 , just like the liberty bridge . 
  silly hungarians , you could have contracted astra arad , which makes very [ nice and affordable trams ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msddqoywh_c ) and has the capacity to make subway cars . 
  the corrupt fuckers at the head of our metrorex even rejected their bid because the price was `` too low '' . 
  softronic from craiova also make [ very nice trains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rudj2k0dbhg ) . 
  it 's no surprise udmr won in satu mare , the city is like 59 % romanian and 38 % hungarian . 
  hungarians tend to have a much higher turnout than romanians and most of them vote for udmr . 
  from 2004 to 2012 , satu mare had another udmr mayor , iuliu ilyes . 
  the thing is , the udmr has lost quite a lot of voters in recent years , because even the hungarians started being fed up with them , some have switched to the more hardline hungarian civic party , others have stopped voting altogether . 
  these guys are spin-off pentecostals i think , so not traditional , but of course , the orthodox moa\u0219te-kissers are n't better , either . 
  yeah , both she and her boss ( nicusor dan ) have accused the sdp of fraud . 
  the usb is a very small organization and they did n't have delegates in every precinct . 
  in the precincts where they had delegates , clotilde armand won , in the ones they did n't , she lost . 
  the sdp attacked them back by claiming they campaigned on saturday and sunday , which is illegal . 
   they 're centre , not centre-right . 
  they never were centre-right since their historical & post-89 conception . 
  the national liberal party is not the `` historical '' national liberal party , it 's pretty much the democrat liberal party without basescu and keeping the pnl name because it has more prestige . 
  i do n't want to get into a debate about the political spectrum in romania , because it would never end , but the pnl is a member of the epp , which is center-right . 
  in the past , it was a member of alde , which is indeed centrist . 
   any political faction that focuses on differentiations & collectivism is centre/centre-left . 
  on their website , they claim to be a centrist party , but they 're also members of the epp , so center-right . 
  ** red : ** social democratic party ( left ) ** yellow : ** national liberal party ( center-right ) ** green : ** democratic union of hungarians in romania ( they claim to represent all hungarians in romania , generally considered center-right ) ** brown : ** national union for progress of romania ( left ), 
  nothing can beat [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbacmvh9xyo ) religious manifestation , though . 
  jobs ? 
  switzerland - because nice nature , clean , quiet , neutral , rich . 
   why dont you send your fucking beggars to these locations instead of shipping them off to other euro countries are you fucking retarded or something ? 
  what , do you imagine we somehow round up beggars and put them in buses labeled `` to sweden '' or what ?!, 
  just like you can go to any country on this fucking continent whenever you want , so can they . 
  romania is n't a fucking charity , like sweden , if they beg here , they get told to fuck off , if you do n't like them , then stop acting like a fucking charity and do n't give them money , then they 'll leave as quickly as they came . 
  the only plausible explanation is that you secretly like them , that 's why you keep giving them money and other freebies . 
  fuck , i thought i 've seen it all . 
  i 'm pretty sure 80 % of mona bottles are drank , not used as rubbing alcohol . 
  it 's nothing more than denatured alcohol with some food coloring and a chemical flavor also used in some chewing gums . 
  it is denatured in the way that it is given an unpleasant taste to discourage human consumption , as required by the regulations , but it does not contain any really dangerous substances like methanol , which was used during the american prohibition to stop people from drinking rubbing alcohol . 
  it 's obviously unhealthy , but so is normal alcohol , other than that it 's basically alcohol that tastes like shit . 
  i do n't think it tastes worse than tantum rosa , which is intended for treating vaginitis or something like that , yet people drink it in order to get high . 
  nope , it 's not , there 's a risk of getting caught with street whores , but that 's part of thrill . 
  with very expensive whores , like fashion models or celebrities , the risk is bigger , because they are usually part oflarger networks which might be under surveillance by the intelligence service , so there 's a risk of being secretly filmed while going at it . 
  apartment prostitutes typically work independently , the police is not interested in them at all , therefore the risk is pretty much non-existant . 
  of course , you have to beware of stds and having your shit stolen , but this is only with lower cost whores , more expensive ones are mostly clean and wo n't steal your stuff . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not from poland , i 'm from romania . 
  here , cheap whores in tir parkings charge around $ 10 for either a suck or fuck , around $ 16 for both . 
  higher quality apartment whores charge around $ 45 - $ 100 per hour , fashion models around $ 100-200 per hour , but some take expensive gifts like perfume , name-brand bags or jewelry . 
  celebrities are generally upwards of $ 500 , but you need connections to get to them and obviously , not all celebrities are willing to fuck for money . 
  sure , i could also send you some [ rom chocolate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmw8biurkq8 ) , [ eugenia biscuits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nyodihpnq4 ) and a pack of [ love plus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evkd0ymrwsc ) condoms . 
  [ meanwhile in romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_rrqsh6r0 ), 
   i just checked prices here and it is quite affordable ... well , of course it 's affordable , poor people need to fuck too , do n't they ? 
  in romania , we have prostitutes for every pocket , from 50 lei to 1000 euros per hour . 
  oh , we also have 4 lei wines , they usually taste like piss . 
  the cheapest alcoholic beverage you can get , in terms of price/alcohol content is called mona , they basically sell it [ as rubbing alcohol ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mjbdmzq.png ) to avoid taxes , and it costs like 4.5 lei for a 500ml bottle , 70 % alcohol content . 
  it is very popular in rural areas , especially in vaslui county . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noc5gpl2toi ) is a commercial for it . 
  bucharest is shit mate , you should visit transylvania , it 's like an entirely different country .
