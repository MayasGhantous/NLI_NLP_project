  totally fair not fair enough . 
  what fair ? 
  could never afford the what ? 
  although , i 'm pretty sure there was a statement from 2012 about the election fraud in 2012 , i could only find a link from 2004 : http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2004/11/041129_pro_democratia.shtml  according to pro democratia , election fraud is somewhere between 2 and 5 percent , so the results of the election , as we can tell so far , can be influenced by the fraud level . 
  ngos say it 's around 2-5 % . 
  in the 2014 presidential election , there was a huge scandal because people abroad were forced to wait in long lines at embassies ( most notably in london and germany ) in order to cast their votes . 
  ponta ( who was also a candidate ) was head of the government , was n't very popular abroad so he knew people from abroad would vote massively for johannis . 
  trust system for voting ? 
  how come you do n't have massive election fraud ? 
  say you register for voting . 
  what stops someone coming , offering # 100 to let them vote in your name ? 
  they do n't ask for id , so how do they know it 's really you ? 
  we also have that issue . 
  we use what are called supplementary lists , so if you are in a different place , you go to the polling station and they write your personal data and you can vote . 
  this did cause some problems in the past , when people were being bussed around different cities to cast multiple votes , but it 's a pretty serious offense and the prison sentence is quite lengthy . 
  this year , as i understand , they will be using an electronic system so you can instantly be found out if you already voted . 
  why do you have to register in order to vote in the uk ? 
  in romania , each polling station has a list with all eligible voters who reside in the precinct , so on the voting day you just go there , give them your id card , sign next to your name , vote and leave . 
  automation will be a very hard pill to swallow in the beginning , but it will eventually get better . 
  there is already a precedent : industrialization . 
  in the beginning , it was disastrous , people with small manufacturing shops went bankrupt the conditions for workers in factories were terrible , but in the end it got better and better . 
  the 8-hour workday was introduced in addition to other new rights , pension , unemployment benefits etc. 
  its unrealistic to think that because of automation millions of people will suddenly become poor , after all , if people are poor , they do n't have money to consume all the stuff that 's being produced . 
  bucharest average is around $ 8/m ^ 2 , in other romanian cities it 's more like $ 5 . 
  sounds like a plan !, 
  if all of romania came to sweden we 'd outnumber you more than two to one . 
  is it like one of those places where you get stabbed for looking at somebody the wrong way ? 
  if you gib us your monies , we will recognize gotland as rightful danish clay . 
  until then , we consider it part of sweden . 
   we 'll forever be behind others , never to exceed them , because we do n't own any of the big players or equivalents to compete on the global market . 
  i could n't care less about who owns the big businesses , unless it 's myself or the state . 
  london is full of billionaires , how much does that benefit the average londer ? 
  not a whole bunch !, 
  yes , they might earn more money working there than in other parts , but they still ca n't afford much - many live in shared houses ( and it 's not just immigrants ) , everything is crazy expensive and life there is stressful and shitty in general . 
  it does n't matter how many billionaires your country has , all it matters is if whether you are one of them or not . 
  like [ these guys ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uig1nydznra ), 
  what if it does have all the right symbols but was printed with my $ 30 printer ? 
  silly swede . 
  if russia annexes romania , we will come to sweden and steal both your planes and sell them at the junkyard for profit !, 
  yeah , but living in the suburbs is not ideal either . 
  in london , public transport is decent and extensive , but it still takes a lot to move around . 
  if your daily commute is 2 hours , you are losing 4 hours of your life every day that no one 's paying you for . 
  imho , london is a great city to visit , but a complete nightmare to live/work in , unless you 're a billionaire . 
  what if they annex gotland instead ? 
  what do you mean ? 
   they have but it 's not recognized by nobody except by the ruskies . 
  it 's not recognized by the russians either . 
  never heard about that , source ? 
  please , read some real history , not russian distorted one . 
   ** moldavian identity in medieval chronicles **  the chronicles of medieval moldavia attested the names used by the inhabitants of moldavia to refer to themselves as well as the common language and origin of moldavians , wallachians and transylvanians . 
  the first important chronicler of moldavia , grigore ureche ( 1590 -- 1647 ) , states that the romanians of the hungarian kingdom and moldavians have the same origin , since both `` come from rome '' . 
  the same author refers to the language of his work as `` our moldavian language '' . 
  later , chronicler miron costin ( 1633 -- 1691 ) wrote in his on the moldavian nation that the `` oldest and more righteous '' name of the people inhabiting moldavia , wallachia and transylvania is rum\u00e2n ( romanian ) , `` that is roman '' , and that this name was kept from emperor trajan 's colonizations till to that day , albeit more commonly among the wallachians and transylvanians . 
  he also mentioned that , while the people of moldavia identify as `` moldavian '' , they call their language `` romanian '' . 
  his son , chronicler nicolae costin ( 1660 -- 1712 ) , expressed similar opinions . 
  the wallachian chronicler constantin cantacuzino ( 1655 -- 1716 ) explains that by romanians he means romanians from wallachia , transylvania , and moldavia , as they all speak essentially the same language and have a common origin . 
  nevertheless he also states that , unlike the wallachians and transylvanians , which identify as `` romanians '' , the population of moldavia identifies as `` moldavian '' . 
  dimitrie cantemir ( 1673 -- 1723 ) , prince of moldavia and member of the royal academy of berlin , wrote a history book called hronicul vechimei a romano-moldo-vlahilor ( chronicle of the ancientness of the romanian-moldavian-vlachs ) . 
  in the introductory part , he calls it `` a chronicle of the entire romanian land '' ( hronicon a toat\u0103 \u021aara rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 ) that `` later was divided into moldavia , wallachia and transylvania '' ( care apoi s-au \u00eemp\u0103r\u021bit \u00een moldova , munteneasc\u0103 \u0219i ardealul ) and mentions that the book was first written in latin and then translated into romanian ( pre limba rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 ) . 
  while attesting that the people of moldavia call themselves `` moldavians '' , he also states that `` romanian '' is to be used when referring commonly to transylvanians , moldavians and wallachians ( carii cu to\u021bii cu un nume de ob\u0219te rom\u00e2ni s\u0103 chiam\u0103 ) . 
   ** selected foreign travelers about moldavians **  several foreign travelers through moldavia since the 16th century noted that locals called themselves `` romanians '' and their language `` romanian '' . 
  they also mention the awareness of a common roman origin among the inhabitants of moldavia and neighbouring wallachia and transylvania . 
  georg reicherstorffer ( 1495 -- 1554 ) , a transylvanian saxon , was the emissary of ferdinand i of habsburg in wallachia and moldavia . 
  describing the geography of moldavia he finds that `` besides this name it is also called wallachia '' and then speaking about the moldavian people he says that `` the roman * italian * language still endures in this nation ... so the wallachians [ from moldavia ] are an italian nation , as they claim , from the old romans '' . 
  a chronicler and mercenary from verona , alessandro guagnini ( 1538 -- 1614 ) , traveled twice in moldavia and helped despot vod\u0103 ( ioan iacob heraclid ) gain the throne in 1563 . 
  in his biography of the prince , `` vita despothi principis moldaviae '' , he described to the people of moldavia : `` this nation of wallachians refer to themselves as romana and say that they originate from exiled romans of italy . 
  their language is a mixture of latin and italian languages , so that an italian can easily understand a wallachian '' . 
  after a visit to moldavia an anonymous traveler , probably an italian jesuit , wrote in 1587 a description of the people and found that `` these people * moldavians * belong to the greek faith , they take kindly to everything that is roman , maybe because of their corrupted language from latin , or for the belief they have about their descent from the romans , as they call themselves romans '' . 
  also , according to these sources , the slav neighbours called moldovans `` vlachs '' or `` volokhs '' , a term equally used to refer to all the romance speakers from wallachia , transylvania , and the balkan peninsula . 
  nicolaus olahus ( 1493 -- 1568 ) , proeminent humanist , writes in hungaria et attila that the moldavians have the same language , rituals and religion as the wallachians and that the only way to distinguish them is by their clothes . 
  he also mentions that the language of moldavians and other vlach peoples was once roman ( latin ) , as they all were colonies of the roman empire . 
   thomas thornton ( 1762 -- 1814 ) wrote a book in 1807 about his numerous travels inside the ottoman empire and says that the wallachian and moldavian peasants call themselves `` rumun , or roman '' , to distinguish themselves from boyars ( local nobles ) , and that their language is a corrupt latin . 
  i 'm obviously not going to vote , but i can still have an opinion , ca n't i ? 
  no , but i lived and worked there for almost 3 years , does it count ? 
  depends on how much you 're offering . 
  remain 2 . 
  europe is important for the future of britain and britain is important for the future of europe . 
  i agree the eu has serious problems and that it needs reforms , but countries picking up their toys and leaving is not a solution , at least not a good one for anyone ( except russia , of course ) . 
  i think it 's going to be a close call , but probably remain will win . 
  he 's the kind of guy that appeals to the emotional side of people , very charismatic , a very good speaker , but when you look beyond the facade , his arguments simply do n't stand up . 
  let 's not forget when he was ranting about how romanian and bulgarians were going to come in doves after 2014 , an apocalypse that has n't really materialized . 
  sure , immigration of romanians and bulgarians has gone up , but not at the scale that he was predicting and they are going there because there is demand for them on the job market . 
  also , many people are coming back from the uk , a flight from london to bucharest or timisoara is only around # 50-60 . 
  i also think the ukip would be dead without nigel . 
  we can steal your monies and then use them to pay you for it . 
  deal ? 
  kovesi was appointed by ponta in 2013 , at the time the romanian government was desperately trying to join schengen , so they needed someone who would make them look good in the eu . 
  i 'm pretty sure he underestimated her , he likely did n't think it would come back to haunt him and his family . 
  she was just given another 3 year term last month and ca n't be replaced until her term expires so the fight against corruption is due continue until at least 2019 . 
  it was common in rural romania until a few years ago , now it 's very rare . 
  in moldova it 's still a thing , even in cities . 
  they are not much more aware of the outside world than the average russian is . 
  while they do have internet access , most of the information about the outside world still comes from russian media outlets . 
  the only ones who have a reasonable picture are the ones who can actually speak romanian/english/french / german and read news from these countries . 
   they are zero romanians here , only moldovans ( these are very different people esp moldovans living in transnistria ) , that 's a lie . 
  my ex-gf is from bender , her family always considered themselves romanian and she studied at a romanian school . 
  there are very few romanian schools in transnistria , but that 's because your fascist government is doing all it can to shut them down , threaten students and teachers etc. 
  because they want to push the so-called `` moldovan language '' with cyrillic letters . 
  i agree that most moldovans in transnistria are almost completely russified , but saying there are no romanians is just not true .
