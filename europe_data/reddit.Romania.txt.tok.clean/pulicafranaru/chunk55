  i do not agree that it 's `` ultra-centralised '' . 
  if it was ultra-centralised , we would n't have 28 different armies , some part of nato , some not , we would n't have 10 different currencies , we would n't have countries which drive on different sides of the road etc. 
  the eu is so weak in many areas , it 's like it does n't even exist . 
  look at the migrant crisis for example , you have countries like germany , which wants migrants , and this causes massive problems for transit countries in south and eastern europe who do n't want to deal with millions of asylum seekers and migrants that want to get to germany or other parts of western europe . 
  if the eu had an effective central institution to control its border and handle applications for asylum seekers , this would n't have been as big of a problem as it is now . 
  now , on the issue that the eu is expensive , un-democratic and bureaucratic . 
  i totally agree , it is indeed a major problem . 
  but you know what mature people do when they encounter a problem ? 
  they sit down and try to find a solution to it , they do n't pick up their toys and leave , that 's what immature children do . 
   but even if all of the above was resolved , that is to say that the eu was run cost-efficiently , with high member state autonomy ( instead of the progressively decreasing autonomy which the federalists are bringing about ) , and it abandoned all of its technocratic/oligarchical facets ( legislation passed by the eu currently does n't really hinge on approval from members of the eu parliament ; they are written up and enacted by a small commission and its `` expert consultants '' - the latter being industry representatives , i.e. 
  corporate lobbyists ) ... 
  the whole foundation on which the eu is built is flawed by its own inherent nature . 
  again , this problem stems from the fact that the ep is fundamentally weak . 
  i doubt any european federalist is pleased with the way the ep currently works . 
  but again , this is an argument to give more power to the ep , not destroy it . 
  the ep is currently the only eu institution whose members are elected by popular vote . 
  people do n't feel very attached to the ep simply because it does n't do much and the reason why it does n't do much is because it ca n't do much . 
  if the ep had similar power to the us congress , people would be more attached to the eu as a whole and meps would be pressured to take into account what the people who voted them in there actually want . 
   it does nothing to prevent isolationism of the eu in regards to non-eu countries , some of whom now have huge barriers to exporting to eu countries , which they did n't necessarily have before the eu 's inception yeah , it 's called protectionism and was n't invented by the eu . 
  if the eu would allow untaxed imports of agricultural or other products from countries where people work for $ 2 a day it would simply destroy farming and industry within the eu . 
  on top of this , the eu has strict health , safety and environmental regulations that prevent import of harmful products . 
  as a romanian who has experienced life both before as well as after joining the eu , i can tell you first hand how much this means . 
  before the eu , you would n't really know if the food you bought at the grocery store was going to poison you or give you salmonella . 
  after we joined the eu and strict regulations were introduced , much has changed . 
  of course , there are still exceptions , but they are few and far between and the respective businesses are eventually found out and closed down . 
  in general , the stuff you can buy in 2016 is much safer than the stuff you could buy in 2006 ( before we joined the eu ) . 
   all of this describes exactly what happened to the ussr , and mark my words , the eu will have the same fate . 
  ah , the good ol' eu = ussr argument . 
  let 's say i 'm willing to overlook the extremely obvious differences between the eu and ussr in terms of how the ussr was formed , how it functioned , how it was run etc. 
  ok , but tell me , now , 25 years later , how many former ussr countries are better off than they were when they were part of the ussr ? 
  except for the baltic states , which joined the eu , ussr nostalgia is strong in all former ussr countries . 
  let 's say russia and azerbaijan are a bit better off , because they are resource rich , but this wo n't last forever . 
  belarus kinda stagnated , it did n't lose much from leaving the ussr , but did n't gain much either and all other former ussr countries are basically borderline failed states . 
  is the post-soviet area the kind of place you want to see europe turn into ? 
   continuing to elect pro-eu politicians will only stall the eu 's collapse , not by any means prevent it . 
  but unfortunately , as with the ussr , this stalling only has one effect , and that is to exacerbate its negative impact on all of our lives . 
  this is why i support all eu-exit movements , and on a larger level , all secessionist movements within every country . 
  the thing is , the world is n't composed of a bunch of mini-states all competing with each other while the eu is the big , ugly , isolationist monster . 
  the world is composed of a superpower ( the us ) , a soon to be ( if not already ) superpower ( china ) and a bunch of major , or soon to be major powers like japan , russia , india , brazil , mexico etc. 
  within the eu , there are only 3 countries which could be relevant on the world stage , namely germany , the uk and france , but even they are declining and will be eventually overshadowed by the bric countries . 
  the sovereignty eu countries would gain by disbanding the eu would almost immediately be lost to the interests of the major powers . 
  think about it , what would happen if the eu was disbanded tomorrow ? 
  putin would immediately make his move on central and eastern europe with propaganda , subversion and threats of military action . 
  china would start pumping money into southern europe , which would be up for sale , and they will become dependent on beijing in the process . 
  western europe would have no one to look to other than the us , which will likely push a trade deal down their throats which will serve washington 's interests more than anyone else 's . 
  all this things are already happening , with the eu being weak , if the eu was disbanded they would only be accelerated . 
  these are tough times , and if europe does n't stick together it will completely cease to be relevant on the world stage . 
  romania also has a law if 20 % of the population in a certain city , town or village is of a different ethnicity , there must be bilingual signs . 
  this did cause some vandalism , but nothing major afaik . 
  also , there are cities which have bilingual/multilingual signs even if the quotas are below 20 % , for example when entering timisoara , the sign is in romanian , german , hungarian and serbian . 
   but ** it is honestly worrying ** that any pro-eu candidate would make it this far in the race , not to mention actually winning the election . 
  why ? 
  after all , austria is a member of the eu ... 
   and where the hell does the ` carries it with him everywhere ' bullshit even come from ? 
  that 's nine kinds of illegal , particularly for a member of parliament funny , because here in romania , mps are part of a select few categories of people allowed to own and carry lethal handguns ( the others being police , military , diplomats , judges , prosecutors and people on the witness protection program ) . 
  hmm , i wonder which party they labeled as far right in romania 's 2012 election . 
  let 's see which parties got seats : usl - an alliance between socialists and liberals , obviously not far right . 
  ard - an alliance between center-right parties , again not far right udmr - democratic union of hungarians in romania , they are probably somewhere in the center-right , but it does n't matter , because they 're supporters are generally hungarians from across the political spectrum , since is the only hungarian party in parliament ( the other , far right , civic hungarian party got no seats . 
  so this leaves us with only one option , the pp-dd , which no longer exists , might have been considered a far right party , if you were biased and had no sense of humor , but in reality it was a joke . 
  from wikipedia :  the people 's party -- dan diaconescu was a populist political party in romania created in 2011 by television presenter dan diaconescu . 
  in june 2015 it merged into the national union for the progress of romania after diaconescu was convicted of extortion . 
   the people 's party -- dan diaconescu was founded in 2011 by romanian tv presenter dan diaconescu . 
  the first congress of the party was held in january 2012 , when the party was officially constituted . 
  at the 2012 local election , the pp-dd came in third , on the party 's ticket 31 mayors , 3,126 local councilors and 134 county councilors were elected . 
  after the election , the party became the fourth largest political force in romania , after the social democrats , the national liberals and the democratic liberals . 
  at the 2012 parliamentary election , the pp-dd came third again , successfully entering parliament with 21 senators and 47 deputies . 
  by june 2013 however , the party became heavily affected by party switching , losing 2 senators and 16 deputies , including its group leaders in both chambers . 
   the ideology of the pp-dd expressed ** nationalist and socialist ** sentiments . 
  the party supported progressive measures like higher retirement pensions and salaries , and a lower vat . 
  the party also supported the collectivization of agriculture and sought a people 's tribunal , the foundation of state companies with directly elected leadership . 
   ** the pp-dd merged into the national union for the progress of romania ( unpr ) on 29 june 2015 . 
  ** ah , the unpr , the leftist party consisting exclusively of party switchers . 
  he was talking about moldova , not romania . 
  do n't worry , the western elite is just as degenerate , for example the panama papers are not exactly old news . 
  the only difference is that the western elite are much better at not being too obvious and covering their tracks . 
  romanian corrupt politicians and business executives are just extremely dumb , it was obvious from the beginning to everyone that they were stealing , but they were counting on the corrupt justice system and media owned by their friends to keep them out of prison . 
  this did work for more than two decades , but it should have been clear that it would n't last forever . 
  when they lost their protection , they were caught with their pants down . 
  but you know what 's the interesting part here ? 
  most of the corporations involved in major scandals in romania are western . 
  microsoft ( us ) , eads ( a.k.a airbus group ) , bechtel ( us ) , hp ( us ) , omv ( austria ) , gabriel resources ( canada ) etc. 
  are not romanian . 
  try saying the words `` ice tea foot '' to a moldavian woman . 
  when i was in holland no one spoke romanian to me , so not good enough . 
  kinda fucked up you have to speak russian when working with russians in moldova , when they should be speaking romanian because it 's the official language . 
  here , if you are hungarian and do n't speak romanian you 're pretty much fucked outside of hungarian villages/areas . 
   the few russian words are used for added humorous effect i thought you guys normally spoke with russian words here and there , not just for humorous effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taj4whnfwck, 
  wait , why does a russian site play a romanian song in the background ? 
  edit : there 's more than one song !, 
  even one by nicolae gu\u021b\u0103 , lel !, 
  yeah , i forgot to mention that one . 
  romania has much tougher laws than the uk . 
  things that would only get you a slap on the writs penalty in the uk ( like shoplifting ) gets you prison time here , 1-2 years . 
  same with pickpocketing . 
  driving drunk and hit a parked car or something ? 
  prison time , baby !, 
  caught dealing weed ? 
  serious prison time , 3-5 years . 
  caught dealing anything else ? 
  you 'll basically rot in jail .
