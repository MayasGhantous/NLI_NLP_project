  a 50-year-old woman in atlanta , an 11-year-old boy in phoenix , a baby in new orleans -- deaths like these are reported and investigated every year . 
  a young man in fresno , ca was killed when a friend 's vertical ` lucky shot ' went straight up and came straight back down , entering his skull . 
  a randomly-fired bullet hit a police helicopter in riverside , california on new year 's eve in 1994 , striking the pilot in the foot and forcing him to make an emergency landing . 
  in dallas , texas on january 1st , 2012 , a bullet came through the roof of a bedroom where a woman was nursing her baby and landed next to her on her bed . 
  i honestly do n't understand this bullshit law about `` warning shots '' in romanian law , you give them the verbal warning , if they refuse to comply , they should only shoot with the intention of actually hitting the guy . 
   further down the thread he also lied about the police being `` helpless '' in getting a man out of a car , despite the fact that they did just that seconds after shooting several warning shots . 
  they took him out of the car ** after he opened the door ** . 
  also , the video is only a minute long , but the whole thing lasted more than half an hour . 
  the cops were complete pussies , they could have simply broken the window and open the door from the inside , but instead they just yelled like monkeys and shot their guns in the air , waking up the entire neighborhood at 3 a.m. 
  there are more videos , but they are on facebook , so i ca n't post the links on / r/europe . 
  not in romania , the laws are shit and cops are pussies , you would probably have to shoot dead 2-3 people before they would consider using lethal force on you . 
  with the amount of paperwork and other crap that police in romania has to do after shooting someone , i doubt they would have shot them even if they were really terrorists . 
  a couple of weeks ago , some rich guy with a porsche ran over a cop who pulled him over for running a red light , then locked himself in the car , started playing anti-police rap music at full volume and showed the cops his dick for like half an hour until his parents came and convinced him to get out of the car . 
  the cops were yelling at him , shooting their guns in the air , but did n't have the guts to do anything else .

  oh , and please enlighten me , where would the money to pay for the legal costs and supposed reparations come from ? 
  1908 was 109 years ago . 
  according to wikipedia , there are around 450 living supercentenarians in the entire world . 
  that is roughly 0.00006 % of the global population . 
  even so , all those supercentenarians alive today , were barely children when these events took place . 
  what this means , is that none of the people alive today could have participated in any way in that massacre . 
  it also means that there are extremely few , if any , people who are alive today that suffered any direct loss from those events . 
  this makes the situation absolutely ridiculous , where you have a bunch of people who never suffered from a specific crime trying to sue a bunch of people who never took part in committing that crime . 
   they may very well be very certain abiut how they feel and how their physical gender didnt correspond with their mental gender . 
  if there was a magic wand that could turn you into the opposite gender , i could understand , but as i said , not even cutting edge technology can do that . 
  you can try to look as a woman , try to act like a woman , but you can never be a woman . 
  also no straight person ( or at least not the vast majority ) would ever be interested in dating a transgender . 
  you ca n't be confident when you 're trying to be something that you ca n't physically be . 
  that 's because sociopaths typically have very good leadership qualities . 
  also , obviously , not all sociopaths suffer all the symptoms or to the same degree . 
  take steve jobs and erdogan for example . 
  steve jobs was very likely a sociopath , but not to the same degree as erdogan . 
  being a sociopath also does n't make you implicitly evil , for example : say you were put in a room by the mafia with 10 other people and you would be given a choice to either pick one person to be killed or not pick a person and then the mafia would shoot 9 of those 10 people at random . 
  you would also be given a very short time to pick a person , like , say 30 seconds , and you would n't personally know any of those people . 
  what would you do ? 
  most normal people likely would n't be able to make a choice in time , but a sociopath would . 
  the point is that being a leader , especially one over an entire country , means you have to make hard decisions , many times under pressure . 
  sociopaths have little difficulty making hard decisions . 
  now , onto the issue of transgender people - if you are so insecure about your own gender that you try to change it despite knowing that 's not really possible , how can you expect to be a good leader . 
  leaders need confidence , a lot of it , and not being comfortable with your own gender , which is one of the most fundamental aspects of your identity as a human , is the complete opposite of confidence . 
  modern day moldova is just the eastern part of historical moldavia . 
  of course , all their claims to the history of moldavia are pretty much bullshit , their `` country '' is nothing more than a soviet invention , just like ddr ( but at least the soviets did n't attempt to convince east germans that they were a different ethnicity than west germans ) . 
  give us back all our cars first , then we 'll think about it . 
  you mean the hungarians who get butthurt every time someone reminds them of trianon ? 
  the solution is simple : bribe some african dictator to let us set up some `` safe zones '' in that country , where ** all ** the people caught illegally entering the eu are sent ( unless they agree to be repatriated in their own country ) . 
  those safe zones can be run by eu military and/or eu leftist volunteers so they ca n't complain about human rights abuses or whatever . 
  provide those people with water , food , medicine , clothing and other basic necesities , but nothing more , until their status can be clarified . 
  legit refugees will be happy with that , economic migrants will not . 
  also , build a wall , use drones , atv , helicopters , boats etc. 
  to make sure all the ones who try to enter the eu are caught right away . 
  i do n't know about slovenia , which is pretty much a developed country , but the fact that produce of the same brand sold in eastern europe is of lower quality than in the west is an old and well known problem . 
  does n't really take someone with a ph.d. to figure that out , simply doing a taste test is sufficient . 
  you see , that 's why we make fun of you guys , it was easy to see this shit turning into a massive shitstorm ever since the first major waves in 2015 . 
  it would have been a totally different context today had we decided to be tough from the beginning . 
  what hungary has done , with the fence , should have been done by greece , bulgaria , romania and croatia as well . 
  to all the idiots saying this is `` fake news '' and trump shook her hand , the pictures where he did shake her hand are taken in a different setting . 
  the photo in question is always accompanied by a handshake and someone in the background is clearly saying `` handshake , president ? 
  '' , yet trump completely ignores it . 
  they hate us 'cause they anus . 
  i do n't think any reasonable human being would put an equal sign between a person who has worked the last 20 years and has been unemployed for a few months and a person that worked for a few months in the last 20 years and spent the rest living on benefits . 
  someone who works pays taxes , including to the unemployment system , so when they do end up being unemployed for a period of time , it 's their own money they 're getting back and no one has the right to bash them for that . 
  however , when someone gets back much more than they contributed , unless they have a legitimate reason ( like being disabled ) , they are nothing more than social parasites . 
  is it fair when you break your car in a pothole , and the state has no money to fix that pothole because they have to pay benefits to a bunch of gypsies who do nothing all day other than eat , drink and fuck , making an army of children just so they can get more social benefits ? 
   he 's not there for the people . 
  i wonder what sort of retard it takes to believe that trump would stand up one minute for the poor guy , or the middle class , at least . 
   young guy here . 
  did n't vote . 
  too apolitical and uninformed to care . 
  translation : i 'm ignorant as fuck and proud of it . 
   i just wish we could be more like japan or south korea , minus the lower status of women and press freedom issues and stuff . 
  translation : in order to prove my ignorance , i will make some completely nonsense claims about two of the three east asian countries i 've ever heard about ... and stuff . 
  while i agree with the first two parts of your explanation , i disagree with the last . 
  poor people are people who do n't have a lot of money . 
  social parasities are a subset of poor people , they do n't have a lot of money , but at the same time they are not doing or planning to do anything productive for the society and choose to rely on social benefits indefinitely . 
  this reminds me when romania wanted to send military and aid to haiti and they screwed up and sent it to tahiti instead . 
  it used to be the same in romania back when i was in middle school 10-15 years ago . 
  the vaccine shots were just given in school , they would n't even ask the parents to sign anything , when the day you had to take the shot , you took the shot , if you tried to avoid it in any way you were pretty much fucked . 
  of course , there were some gypsies who did n't send their kids to school at all back then as well , but the number of unvaccinated children was negligible . 
  the problem today is that millenials are starting to have children and sadly , many are completely retarded and disregard professional advice in favor of shit they read on blogs and dubious websites . 
  many are taking advice from olivia steer , a former newscaster with no medical background , probably the most retarded woman in romania . 
  interesting that the fall has been most dramatic during conservative governments . 
  the worst losers from those things are the people who thought it would be different . 
  i remember the idiots who were saying about trump , for example , `` oh , he 's not really going to build a wall , that 's just campaign talk , but you know , hitlery , she 's going to start world war 3 !, 
  their platforms were indeed different , after all , what would be the point of running against each other if they had the same platforms ? 
  but their platforms are n't black and white , it 's just typical left-wing bullshit vs. right wing bullshit . 
  i can understand someone who benefits from obamacare or is lgbt or whatever voting for clinton , just as well as i can understand someone who owns a small business voting for trump because they do n't really fancy being forced to pay 12 bucks an hour minimum wage and more taxes in general . 
  but those are the people who would vote democrat or republic anyway , even if their party of choice threw a potato as a presidential candidate . 
  the battle was n't for those kinds of people , it was for the people who were n't decided who to vote for and they looked more at the characters rather than the platforms . 
  this is where hillary 's crappy personality and the scandals surrounding her really dragged her down . 
  as i said in the first post , if the democrats had chosen anyone other than hillary to run for president , on the same exact platform , they would have probably won . 
   fran\u00e7ois fillon manages to get to the second round somehow . 
  if fillon gets in the second round , it would be like france becoming romania 2.0 . 
  it would actually be worse , because we have so far dodged the possibility of someone involved in a massive corruption scandal getting into the second round of the presidential election ( ponta is probably corrupt as fuck , but at least he was n't being investigated for corruption when he ran for president in 2014 and he lost , nonetheless ) . 
  yeah , like a choice between dog shit and horse shit . 
  if you 've been forced to clean up dog shit for many years , it 's likely that you might end up choosing horse shit for a change , when given the choice . 
   trump has been called racist , mysoginistic , new hitler and the people who called him that got him elected imho , actually trump got elected because the only other option was hillary . 
  hell , if the republicans got some random dude off the streets to run against hillary , the random dude would have probably won , maybe the popular vote as well . 
  another thing to take into consideration when talking about trump is that americans did n't really have much of a choice , as they were served only two terrible options - hillary and trump . 
  reading the opinions of reasonable people who voted for trump ( yes , surprinsingly there is a large number of actually reasonable people with an iq above 90 who voted for trump ) , the vast majority did n't vote because they liked or even believed that trump would do anything good , but because they really hated hillary , either because of the policies she supported or because of the way the way the democrats handled this whole campaign . 
  hillary was probably the worst candidate they could push forward , had it been anyone else , trump would have likely lost .
