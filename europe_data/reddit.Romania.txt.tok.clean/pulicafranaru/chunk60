  they do n't have an ideology , they have both right wing ( corporatists ) and left wing activists in their party . 
  they themselves admitted they would probably split up if they gained any significant share of the vote . 
  the only things that bind them together is that they all claim to support the anti-corruption crackdown , transparency and good governance . 
  i personally do n't like either nicusor dan , nor clotilde armand , but i voted for them because my hatred for the mainstream parties was greater than my distaste for the usr . 
  the only guy from the usr i actually do like , is iulian bulai , the guy seems really passionate and he makes lots of blogposts + photos and videos , exposing the disgusting attitude of his colleagues from the mainstream parties . 
  she did n't work for airbus , she worked for mi-gso , which was subcontracted by airbus . 
  the soviets were removed from romania long before they started with perestroika and glasnost . 
  the soviet reforms were bullshit , all those soviet states were turned into oligarchies , except for the baltics , who were smart and told the russians to fuck off as soon as they got the chance . 
   it 's hard not to feel like a colony better to ** feel ** like a colony of the us than to ** be ** a colony of russia . 
   lies , latvia and estonia do n't have any too . 
  ok , i might have missed those two , but : - latvia and estonia has a much lower population density than moldova ( latvia has aroun 34/km2 and estonia has 28 , while moldova has 104 ) - latvia and estonia have quite a few dual carriageways , which on some portions are basically identical to motorways ( with emergency lanes and interchanges ) while moldova has only a few short sections of dual carriageway around chisinau which are not even remotely similar to motorways ( i.e. 
  no emergency lanes )  and this has been done partially in the north , between chisinau and orhei . 
  wot , when ? 
  iirc that 's just a regular four lane road , not an expressway . 
  [ this is what an expressway looks like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2l7xs8vwky ) . 
   also , i would n't be so cocky when romania 's motorways are not engineered by romanians in the first place . 
  that 's funny , because the guy who lives two stories below me does precisely that : engineers motorways . 
  are you implying he 's not romanian ? 
   in fact , it is always romanians who halt and/or block their construction . 
  that happens because there are `` smart boys '' who find out where the motorway is going to pass through and buy land there , then sue to state to get more money . 
  or there are `` archeologists '' who just happen to find some bones or some crap exactly where the motorway is supposed to pass through and then hold the construction hostage to force the state to give them funds . 
  it 's just typical eastern european shenanigans , it has little to do with the actual construction . 
  anyway , at least we have almost 800 km of motorways , you have 0 , so it 's pretty much r\u00e2de ciob de oal\u0103 spart\u0103 . 
   taste is debatable , but it surely beats the quality of the romanian `` wine '' . 
  and the quality of romanian beer surely beats the quality of your beer . 
  what 's the point ? 
  [ these are the top 50 most expensive wines in the world ] ( http://www.wine-searcher.com/most-expensive-wines ) , i do n't see moldova around there . 
  - the galleries were formed naturally , moldova is the only non-microstate country in europe without a single km of motorway , do n't expect them to be able to build huge underground cellars . 
  - their wine is ok , but not comparable to french wine . 
  $ 480 per bottle is n't even very much in the world of luxury wines . 
  because he outlived his usefulness . 
  people like motorola , givi are useful when you want to cause chaos , but they quickly become a liability when you want to bring everything under control . 
  romania and hungary in the same color on a language map ? 
  now this is something new . 
  dragnea is basically like hitler in his final days right now . 
  please do not use banners with '' #rezist '' . 
  the hashtag was invented by a leftist ngo financed by george soros , which is part of a growing number of organizations who are trying to hijack the protests to serve their own agendas . 
  use anti-corruption slogans , whatever is on your mind , but please to do not give free advertising to these ngos . 
  yeah , when they realized only a few brainwashed pensioners showed up , they lied again , as usual , and said they did n't organize it . 
  their argument is still retarded though , if their supporters are so retarded they need the party to tell them when to protest . 
  also , the interviews at the pro-government rally where like comedy sketches . 
  they asked one girl who looked around 13-14 why she came to the protest , she said `` i came here to support my grandma . 
  the government raised her pension by 25 % , why should n't i support the government '' . 
  another pensioner said `` the ones in victory square , we 're the ones who feed them '' - what can i say , flawless logic right there babushka . 
  other than that , they pretty much repeated whatever propaganda they heard on pro-government tv channels , like `` iohannis wants to sell the country '' , `` the protesters in victory square are paid by soros '' etc. 
  it was funny , but there 's nothing you can feel for those pro-government protesters other than pity . 
  1500 , actually . 
  a bit underwhelming for the 1 million they promised . 
  meanwhile at the pro-government protest , around 1500 , mostly pensioners . 
  the sdp leaders promised a million people would show up . 
   i say this because one of my friends is romanian and he was also at the protest but he told me things were clearly not spontan and organized way before the law to be announced . 
  everyone knew the government supported this law , but no one ( except for the core of those involved ) knew it would be passed tuesday night , not even some government ministers . 
  had it not been passed , the protests would have been a lot smaller . 
   then those who had an interest in manipulating people told them it is not ok to yell to take down the government first since then the rule could n't be taken down . 
  so they told the mass people to yell for the ` abrogation ' of the rule . 
  how is that manipulation ? 
  people who are protesting know they do n't want this decree to take effect . 
  telling them what is the way to achieve this goal does not mean manipulation . 
   guess what , the next day people yelled for that . 
  i find it shady as fuck and it is not people 's fault , but those who manipulate the crowd . 
  well , of course they did , we live in the digital age , information travels quickly , we have the internet on our watches for christ sake . 
  people see stuff on facebook , post on reddit , others see it , share it and so on . 
  it 's no manipulation , things like this have been happening for years , i see some meme on some obscure group on facebook or reddit , a few days later i hear it from someone who has n't even heard of reddit or that obscure facebook group . 
  take the `` b\u0103 cristi ! '', 
  video , one day it was just an obscure video on youtube , before you knew it , they were bringing in the riot police in college campuses because everyone was yelling `` b\u0103 cristi ! '', 
  all day long . 
   there are also a lot of children aged 10-17 who go to prostests just ` for fun ' or because ` it is cool ' and they protest for something they do n't even know . 
  they just heard opinions and got manipulated . 
  do n't tell me a 10years old knows politics . 
  a 10 year old might not know politics , but they do now stealing is wrong , and that 's enough . 
   the law is wrong . 
  true . 
  it should be taken down . 
  but there are a lot of other interests behind this and the population is severely used into this !!!, 
  see , now this just shows that you 're the one being manipulated and not the people on the streets . 
  this is exactly what the psd propaganda wants you to think . 
  they know they ca n't convince someone with half a brain that this law is n't good , so they use diversion tactics , b-but iohannis , b-but soros , b-but illuminati !, 
  ! 1 the psd 's propaganda methods are n't anything innovative , putin has been using this shit for years . 
  it 's called a diversion . 
  whenever russia does something fucked up , they bombard you with information to cast doubt . 
  russian rebels are idiots and shoot down civilian plane , then brag about shooting down a ukrainian military plane on twitter . 
  when they realized they fucked up , `` no , it was a ukrainian plane that shot down the plane '' , `` no , it was a ukrainian buk that shot down the plane '' , `` no , obama did it ! '' . 
  see the pattern ? 
  this is exactly what the psd is trying to do now : `` iohannis is lying to the protesters '' , `` the protesters are being paid '' , `` soros is behind this '' , `` people are misinformed '' , `` there are foreign interests at play '' , `` the government law is good but we made some mistakes communicating it '' etc. 
  everything to divert the attention from the effects of decree . 
  they adopted typical communist diversion tactics . 
  things like saying the oug was actually good , but it was communicated badly , that ambassadors were misinformed , that people in the streets were manipulated by iohannis and soros etc. 
  in other words , they called us all idiots . 
  they definitely need to go away , i do n't care what they do , they can even bring their retarded brainwashed supporters to start a civil war , they 're still going down . 
   yeah , violent clashes against a majority of pensioners that are psd 's main voting base . 
  yes , the majority of their voters are pensioners , but the numbers for other age groups are not exactly negligible . 
  a thing we often tend to forget is that not all young people in romania live in bucharest , timisoara or cluj , go to university , speak three foreign languages and make lots of money working for a corporation or running their own business . 
  in fact , the vast majority of young people have few opportunities , speak no foreign languages and work for the minimum wage or go to shovel shit in the west for $ 5 an hour . 
  these people are just as easy to manipulate as a pensioner who lives with a $ 200 per month pension . 
  if we do n't start doing something to reduce the gap between the two groups , i think we will eventually end up in a really shitty situation where we will see a teleormanization of romania , with more and more dragnea style politicians being elected and us incapable of doing anything meaningful to stop it . 
  just look at moldova , dragnea would be considered decent judging by their standards for politicians . 
  they had a president with a german last name ( schmidt ) but he was found to have plagiarized his ph.d. thesis or something . 
  she 's not part hungarian , her ex-husband is hungarian and she kept his name after the divorce . 
  the guy is actually hungarian , but yeah , that 's not he 's real accent , he exaggerates it and makes grammar mistakes which are stereotypical of hungarians ( getting the gender and plural forms wrong ) .
