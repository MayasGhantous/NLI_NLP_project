  they made no mentions of the prison overpopulation problem during the campaign , but it became romania 's problem # 1 right after the new government was installed . 
  is n't this a bit weird , to say the least ? 
  they already tried to pass that ordinance on january 18th , but iohannis found out from some secret source ( most likely the intelligence service or some government employees who were still patriots ) and stormed in the government building to stop them . 
  the government lied again , saying they were n't planning to discuss the ordinance anyway , but the ordinance was clearly marked for entering into force on jan. 18 . 
  after jan. 18 , the government lied a lot , that they were no longer planing an emergency ordinance , that indeed it should be decided by parliament , blah , blah , blah . 
  basically everything they said was to make it seem they were n't planning to do anything really soon , then boom , tuesday night they pass it , despite it not being on the daily task list and after passing it , they published it in ** record time ** in the official monitor . 
  had they really been acting in good faith , then why do such a hit and run ? 
  there is no doubt the ordinance had been planned to the very last detail as dedicated to all the corrupt politicians . 
  for example , there was a huge list of crimes which were only partly pardoned , like theft , rape , murder etc. , but somehow manslaughter did n't make it to that list ? 
  well , because gabriel oprea , one of the most prominent politicians is accused of manslaughter . 
  also , when they did pass the ordinance , they made a last hour adjustment to save their own asses by decriminalizing the act of `` favoring the criminal through passing normative acts '' , which is exactly what they ( the government members ) did . 
  the constitution provides the government with the power to pass emergency ordinances , like this one , which bypass the parliament and president . 
  but they really are n't meant to be used in this way . 
  the constitution clearly states `` the government can only adopt emergency ordinances in extraordinary situations , which can not be delayed '' . 
  i honestly do n't think a mass prison pardon is something that is so urgent that it ca n't wait being discussed by parliament . 
  these fucks are willing to fuck up the entire country just so they can get out or stay out jail . 
  in fact , this emergency decree is unconstitutional , if they do n't care about that , i 'm sure they do n't give the slightest fuck about what agreements romania has with the eu . 
  btw , it 's also rather dumb if the eu expects corrupt fucks to fight corruption , it would be like expecting al capone to fight tax evasion . 
  i realized you were romanian after i posted my reply and you edited your comment . 
  but i figured i could as well leave the translation there for other people who might be reading the comment . 
   tbh i doubt these people even have national id . 
  in another video , the guy who was clowning himself behind the woman actually showed his id card on camera and it was full of stamps proving he had voted every time . 
  what if we storm his office and force him to do it ? 
  the time for civil and peaceful solutions has ended anyway , it has become clear that this bunch of criminals can only be coerced through force . 
  if we 're gon na have a revolution , it will be to abolish democracy . 
  young people simply do n't care enough to vote nowadays and the people who are easily manipulated , or even worse , do n't even know what they are voting for , are very disciplined at election times . 
  to get a grasp at just how bad the situation is , imagine there are hundreds of thousands , if not millions , who are at the level of [ this woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zekjq8xwkhe ) or not much better . 
  translation : woman : muscata is my name . 
  but can you read ? 
  woman : aaah , he kissed me !, 
  cameraman : can you read ? 
  woman : no , i ca n't read . 
  cameraman : and what 's your last name ? 
  woman : muscata , just muscata !, 
  cameraman : and do n't you have a family name ? 
  woman : no , i do n't know [ unintelligible ] cameraman : and what 's that guy 's name who is running for president from the `` three roses '' [ referring to the social democratic party 's logo ] ? 
  man : what 's your name [ unintelligible ] ? 
  woman : yes !, 
  cameraman : yes woman : monta , monta !, 
  [ referring to victor ponta ] cameraman : monta ?!, 
  woman : yes . 
  that 's the guy . 
  cameraman : and why did you vote for him ? 
  woman : so that he gives us electricity , food , flour , sugar , cooking oil , what else ? 
  well , it was getting cleaner , but then elections happened , and the bad guys won . 
  you might of course be asking `` but who would vote for such people ? '' . 
  well , you know , romania is n't among the most advanced countries in europe and we have quite a lot of dumb fucks who are easily manipulated , after all , who do you think [ this fine gentleman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noc5gpl2toi ) most likely voted for ? 
  or this [ intellectual ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmnws6gveku ) ? 
  or this [ sophisticated lady ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zekjq8xwkhe ) ? 
  another thing that did n't really help was that the main opposition party ( the party iohannis came from ) , the national liberal party , just kept shooting itself in the foot in the past two years , so voter turnout was extremely low , below 40 % , allowing the social democrats , the corrupt fucks , to grab a huge victory . 
  no , that 's just pro-government propaganda mate . 
  they are blaming the protests on soros , when they 're the ones who just passed an emergency decree to pardon a huge number of criminals . 
  it 's just a standard diversion tactic , they have n't even brought any credible evidence , the stuff they have been saying up to this point is basically alex jones level bullshit . 
  it 's not * mostly eu money * , eu money are actually a small percentage of the total public spending and it 's actually easier to embezzle state money , because there are less controls on how they 're spent . 
  it does n't matter if they react now , there 's no possibility to reverse the emergency decree now . 
  they should have reacted weeks ago , when the government was planning this shit . 
  the eu should have reacted weeks ago , when the psd was planning this shit . 
   hope that people learned their lesson and wont for this corrupt party , which is responsible for this , next time . 
  the problem is n't that many people voted for them , the problem is that many people did n't vote at all . 
  they were voted by around 20 % of the total population , a third of their voters are their own party members . 
  i 'm literally shaking with anger right now . 
  fuck work , tomorrow i leave for bucharest . 
  that 's absolutely true . 
  currently , if you have an idea and want to turn it into a business , you literally have to fly all over europe to find someone to provide seed funding for your idea . 
  this is simply not possible for a young aspiring entrepreneur who 's just fresh out of college or a college dropout . 
  europe definitely needs a silicon valley of its own if it is to compete with the us . 
  i 'm sorry , but i have to completely disagree with what you are saying . 
   you do n't need start-ups for that . 
  all those services were made possible thanks to public spending in r&d . you can have governments to fund european alternatives if needed . 
  what do you mean `` were made possible thanks to public spending in r&d '' ? 
  they were created by entrepreneurs with ideas and determination and funded mostly by private companies and individuals . 
  google , apple , facebook , twitter and others were all small startups before they became big companies . 
  whether they were made possible by public spending in r&d or not sounds a lot like the chicken or egg dilemma to me . 
   why does everything need to be `` start-ups '' nowadays ? 
  small companies provide shit working conditions and no life stability . 
  that 's exactly the reason why populism has been reinforced and trump was elected in the first place . 
  we need stable jobs in big companies that fulfill the plan that governments create . 
  we have funded space projects in eu , we can also do it for some silly things in comparison like e-mail or social media services . 
  well , first of all , start-ups tend to be more innovative than large companies because they take more risks , as it 's all or nothing for them , while for large companies it 's much more complicated when you have lots of things to worry about at the same time as well as shareholders to please . 
  yes , they might provide worse working conditions than big companies , but they also have lower expectations than established brands . 
  if you are a recent graduate , or even worse , a self taught developer , it 's not so easy to get a job at a big company directly . 
  you do n't need to work your entire life for startups , but they are a great place to gain experience . 
  you can move on to bigger companies later , or who knows , if the startup you work at ends up becoming a success , you 'll have a great life working there . 
  now , speaking of the government , this is the part i disagree with you most . 
  the government is simply the worst option for these kinds of things . 
  the government only works in these kinds of cases : 1 . 
  when it would naturally be against the common interest to have private companies doing something - as would be the case with the military , police , prisons etc. 
  when it would take to much time to get any return on investment - as would be the case with space exploration for example . 
  when it 's a natural monopoly , like roads , bridges etc. 
  when it 's an essential service that would be too expensive for most citizens to afford if it was offered exclusively by private companies , like healthcare or education ( still , quality wise , private healthcare and education are usually vastly superior to the public alternative ) that 's it . 
  in all other areas governments suck compared to private companies . 
  why ? 
  it 's simple , because government agencies do n't need to turn a profit . 
  the state makes money anyway , through taxes which you are forced to pay , regardless of whether you think the government is doing a good job or not . 
  employees in the public sector are not under the same pressure that employees in the private sector are . 
  in many government agencies you can get away with just sitting on your ass , doing nothing all day . 
  of course , there are some public companies which are successful , like say renault , but that 's because they have a private management . 
  with this being said , there 's simply no way in hell government would ever come up with a viable competitor to google or facebook . 
  they could throw as much money at it , even $ 100 billion , they would n't make it , in fact most of the money would be stolen . 
  that 's why i said the eu should ** encourage ** startups .
