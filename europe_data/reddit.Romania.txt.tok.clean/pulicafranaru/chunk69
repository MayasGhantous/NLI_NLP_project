  i wonder , do people in the balkans realize this shit is retarded ? 
  i mean we have sort of the same problem in moldova , but at least most people agree that the `` moldovan language '' bullshit is retarded . 
  they are n't . 
  the only difference between serbs , bosnians and croats is religion , and religion makes people behave retarded . 
   in my example it would be fiber optics instead of patching up the same shitty dial-up or whatever people are using in the west . 
  you do realize replacing a copper wire with fiber optics is like 1000 times more expensive than just patching said copper wire , right ? 
  i can understand most words and sentences , but there are parts where i 'm totally lost . 
  it sounds like english spoken with a really thick dutch accent . 
  using attractive women to advertise shit is probably as old as advertising itself . 
  yeah , good luck with that , with the average german so obsessed with privacy , they call the cops on you if you dare photograph their house . 
  it 's easy to inflate the number of your sexual partners if you fuck prostitutes though . 
  the number of sex partners is also something people tend to lie about . 
  well , was n't really that spectacular . 
  since szonja did n't want to get gang banged and we did n't want to go to prison , our only chance was to fuck the hungarian guy , so we were like `` well , pista , unfortunately it seems no girl wants to take part in our orgy , you know what that means , right ? '' . 
  and then pista ran away in horror after realizing his ass was about to get rekt and we had to search for him for almost an hour . 
  in the end , no sexy times were had . 
   while almost third have partaken in a threesome and a quarter an `` orgy '' . 
  that 's it , fuck the terrorists and shit , i 'm moving to paris . 
  we almost had an orgy at new year 's , but even though all the guys were cool with it , the only girl who seemed to like the idea was the hungarian girl , but she backed off when she realized she was about to get gang banged . 
  it 's a shame , because she was also the hottest one . 
  that 's actually a great idea of how to deal with my pesky neighbor . 
  this is why i love spending new year 's away from city centers and shit . 
  away in the countryside with friends , we get piss drunk , smoke weed , play games , have sex with hot girls and no retards to disturb us . 
  well , apparently they do n't really give a shit . 
  i met the guy personally a few years ago . 
  definitely not dumb , but not extremely smart either . 
  he is now trying to look like he will just be dragnea 's guy ( probably not to piss him off from the start ) , but i 'm pretty sure he has his own agenda . 
  either way , i 'm pretty sure the interest of the country and the people wo n't be his first priority , it 'll probably be like ponta 2.0 . 
  well , still , we 're eastern europe , the `` backwards '' , `` anti-progressive '' , `` uber-conservative '' guys , when a country in we or north america will have a muslim head of government , and when any majority muslim country will have a non-muslim head of government , you let me know , and perhaps we 'll think about it . 
  it 's better to * just * be a corrupt puppet than a corrupt puppet whose husband is a supporter of assad , worked in his government and your brother in law is banned from entering the eu altogether . 
  it was rekt since the election , now was the question of whether we will end up with a crescent up on victoria palace or not . 
   the uk is unlikely to put up a border . 
  then how do they expect to be able to control who enters the uk . 
  eu citizens can travel to ireland regardless of whether they are model citizens or have served more years in prison than they have been outside of prison . 
  one of the main points of brexit was to have the ability to stop criminals from the eu from entering britain , was n't it ? 
   ireland will be required by the eu to put up a border . 
  ireland is not in schengen , thus wo n't be required to do shit . 
  is that some highly sophisticated video editing or is he really retarded ? 
  parallel construction is basically when investigators lie in court about how they obtained certain evidence . 
  so , for example , the intelligence service finds out , through mass surveillance , that you have an assload of drugs at your house and tip off the cops . 
  but the cops ca n't just go to a judge and say `` hey , we got this tip from [ insert intelligence service here ] '' , because the intelligence service should n't have been keeping you under surveillance in the first place . 
  thus , what happens , is that some `` concerned citizen '' calls the cops and says he heard some loud screaming coming from your house and believes someone might be in danger . 
  in pretty much every country , if cops believe someone 's life is in imminent danger , they can enter a house without needing a search warrant . 
  thus , the bullshit story is used in court , concealing the real story of how the intelligence service illegally tapped your phone or whatever . 
  sometimes , there can be legitimate reasons for parallel construction , for example to protect informants , but in those cases the evidence was not obtained illegally , the only reason would be to protect someone who 's life could be in danger . 
  as someone from a former commie country , it really surprises me how easily people in the west buy government bullshit . 
  maybe it 's because they do n't know how it 's like to get fucked by your own government , at least not yet . 
  here in romania , mass surveillance is basically taken for granted . 
  laws mean nothing . 
  it 's not just paranoia , a friend of mine , after taking the baccalaureate exam was called in at the prosecutor 's office . 
  the prosecutor had a huge pile of papers containing transcripts of all his phone conversations in the last few months . 
  though he was n't charged , the intelligence service , who tapped his phone , had absolutely no legal basis to do so , they just did it because his dad was president of the high school parents committee ( they also tapped his dad 's phone ) . 
  i 'm 100 % sure intelligence services in western europe do the exact same illegal shit , they 're just less obvious about it , because unlike the romanian intelligence service , which is de facto above the law , since they get away with pretty much anything , western intelligence services risk scandals if they are caught . 
  the only reason they want a legal framework for mass surveillance , is not because they are n't already doing it , which they are , but because they ca n't use the data which is currently obtained illegally in a court of law , unless they use parallel construction , which is not as easy as it seems . 
  now , regarding the encryption issue , the terrorism argument is complete bullshit . 
  terrorists use encrypted services because they know they ca n't be tracked . 
  as soon as governments get backdoors into them , they will simply move on to other methods of communication , while the rest of us stupidly lament about how we gave up our privacy in exchange for nothing . 
  if you could really trade privacy for security , then countries like china , russia or turkey should be among the safest on earth . 
  yet they are n't . 
  mass surveillance is just a tool for governments to control the people , not to keep them safe . 
   hawkins was concerned that if she did not apply she would be forced `` to join ** a us-style ** two-hour immigration queue '' while the rest of her family `` sail through the uk passport lane '' . 
  tbh , i believed the same thing when i first went to the us : ** expectations ** - i imagined i would be taken in a small ice office , with one guy going through my luggage , another one going through my phone and laptop and asking me uncomfortable questions while a third guy would be inserting a probe into my asshole . 
  expected total time for going through immigration - at least one hour ** reality ** - some bored ass dude who looked like he was high on weed , took a quick glance at my passport and papers , told me to look up at a crappy webcam so he could snap a picture , gave me my papers back and that was it . 
  actual total time of going through immigration - 5 minutes . 
  correlation does not mean causation . 
  i do n't know , but if i would have to guess , i 'd say alcohol . 
  the guy in the thumbnail is iohannis . 
  it says `` 2012 or latest data '' . 
  i imagine syria stopped counting murders after 2010 . 
  but even so , i 'm not sure victims of war , not even victims of war crimes , count as murder , i imagine crimes related to war are classed differently . 
  why is south africa so fucked up ? 
   why did romania invade ? 
  because sfatul \u0162\u0103rii previosly proclaimed the moldavian democratic republic as a federal subject of the russian democratic federative republic . 
  that 's bullshit , we invaded to clear the remaining bolshevik scum , and that was done in a matter of weeks . 
   the only righteous owner of bessarabia are people of bessarabia . 
  except bessarabia is a russian invention from the 19th century . 
  bessarabia is just eastern moldavia . 
   if they wish to unite with romania - fine , but why did n't it happen in the last 25 years ? 
  because politicians who care more about their political interests more than the national interests . 
  snegur proposed to iliescu that he be made vicepresident of romania , iliescu for some reason told him to go fuck himself and that was the end of that . 
  after 2000 , the economic gap between the two countries grew larger and larger and unification became unfeasible . 
  romania is n't west germany , and even if it was , the economic difference between romania and moldova today is even larger than the difference between west and east germany was . 
  there would simply be no way to unite romania and moldova without completely fucking up the economy , that why politicians only talk about it , but there are no concrete plans . 
   we helped you to get independence from turks and you stabbed us in the back when we were weak , of course we paid back , what did you expect ? 
  yeah , that 's why you fought against the ottomans , because you wanted to `` free '' the romanian people , no other interests , right ? 
  also , we did n't stab anyone in the back , we just took back the shit that was ours , unlike you guys , who love to take shit that is n't yours . 
   it was the ussr who invaded you , which was ruled by georgian yeah , a georgian who changed his name to sound russian and engineered the soviet invasion of georgia . 
  however , his nationality is irrelevant , he was a psychotic mass murderer , just like hitler , and if hell exists , i 'm sure they both share a place in its lowest chamber . 
   russians made up only half of its population . 
  yet russia dominated the soviet union and declared itself as the official successor state after its dissolution , not to mention even today it still thinks it has some sort of rightful claim to influence over the former soviet countries . 
  if russia really wanted to , it could have distanced itself from the soviet union after 1991 , yet it did n't , so the responsibility to apologize belongs to russia , and only russia . 
  not exactly 104 % , but around 25 % , which is still definitely way more than normal . 
  chrome runs at about 16 % , which is better , but still more than normal . 
  there 's probably something fucked up about that animation . 
  i 'm not so sure he understands . 
  in fact , i 'm not sure iohannis understands anything at this point , since after less than two years in office the psd is stronger than it has been in more than a decade and the party which brought iohannis to power is in shambles . 
  iohannis is basically constantinescu 2.0 at this point , a president which has won the election on very high hopes then screwed up in the worst way possible . 
  i kind of saw this shit happening ever since the presidential campaign , when iohannis was asked who he thought was the best former president of romania , he named constantinescu . 
  sure , he did n't have many options to choose from , but had he been a little smarter , he would have avoided picking one . 
  i do n't see anything bad about not choosing the `` best '' president , when your options are a crazy megalomaniac ( ceausescu ) , a disgusting criminal ( iliescu ) , an idiot ( constantinescu ) and a sinister clown ( basescu ) .
