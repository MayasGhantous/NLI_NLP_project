  iohannis is dumb . 
  by rejecting sevil shhaideh , he played right into dragnea 's game , who will now make a move eother to propose himself as pm or try to suspend iohannis . 
  he should have let the psd embarrass themselves with a pm with almost no experience and a walking national security threat of a syrian husband . 
  with a little luck , the psd would have fucked up so badly that we would get early elections with a much higher turnout to weed the psd out . 
  however , with iohannis being the dumb fuck that he is , the psd will throw another shitty candidate that iohannis will either have to accept , or face suspension . 
  we did n't invade shit , the russian empire went to shit and bessarabia ** chose ** to unite with romania , it was n't annexed . 
  also , what makes you think you have any claim over a territory whose inhabitants are n't russians , not even slavs , except for the typical disgusting russian grandomania ? 
  we invaded you after you invaded bessarabia , it 's not like we got bored one day and just casually decided to invade the ussr . 
  yup , spot on . 
  so , half of century of suffering under communism as well as annexation of a large chunk of territory are n't good enough reasons ? 
  if not , maybe the fact that they have never apologized for that shit ... 
   rude ? 
  is moldovan already a swear word in romania ? 
  come on i do n't know if rude is the perfect word to describe it , but ignorant as fuck surely is . 
  the differences between the portuguese spoken in portugal and the portuguese spoken in brazil are bigger than between the romanian spoken on both banks of the prut river , yet the brazilians do n't claim they speak brazilian , that would just be stupid . 
   the state may be artificial ( states are a social construct , as opposed to '' natural '' things ) that is true , however the difference between real states and artificial states is that the real states have some history that actually bind them together , like for example the us has its war of independence and founding fathers , they are not merely dejections of failed empires , like moldova or most african countries are . 
   but the moldovan ethnicity is not ok , let 's say moldovan is indeed an ethnicity . 
  then you agree this applies to all moldovans who inhabit the territory of the former principality of moldavia , not just the republic of moldova , right ? 
  but then , you have six millions moldovans in the romanian side and only around 3 million ( if we exclude the soviet transplants ) on the rm side ? 
  if moldovan is a separate identity , how come almost none of the six million moldovans in the romanian side identify themselves as a separate ethnicity ? 
  and another question for you : eminescu is the national poet of both romania and moldova . 
  so please , you tell me , was he moldovan or was he romanian ? 
  as a romanian , this sounds very weird to me . 
  in romania , insulting politicians , especially the ones in power is a national sport . 
  and by `` insulting '' , i mean hardcore profanities , not saying you would n't serve them coffee . 
  for example , a journalist once called iohannis `` onannis '' and a popular anti-ponta slogan was `` puie monta '' . 
  seriously , ukraine ? 
  53 % of romanians view russia positively ? 
  smells like bullshit . 
  there are two main reasons : low turnout and zombie voters . 
  moldova has been run by so-called `` pro-eu '' parties for the last 8 years . 
  the problem with the pro-eu parties was that a bunch of opportunists , not really committed to the pro-eu cause , more committed to their own pockets , including former pro-russians infiltrated these parties ' leadership ranks . 
  the result of this is obvious for all to see , moldova is still poor and corrupt as fuck , in general the shittiest country on the continent . 
  this obviously disgruntled a lot of people , thus the relatively low turnout of 53 % . 
  the second big problem are the zombie voters . 
  these are people irreversibly brainwashed by russian propaganda and vote pro-russia no matter what . 
  they are very disciplined , unlike people from the pro-eu camp who quickly get turned off by corrupt politicians and lies , these people will vote whatever the party throws at them , even a damp smelly rag like dodon . 
  take gagauzia for example , where dodon took over 99 % of votes . 
  it 's pretty much the exact same situation as with romania and the psd . 
  the psd has a large core of disciplined voters , so whenever turnout is low , they win , big time . 
  this is why the psd has consistently been the largest party in parliament ( because fewer people vote in parliamentary elections ) , but has lost almost every presidential election ( the last time they won was in 2000 , when they got incredibly lucky because the right was very divided and iliescu ended up running against fascist nut-job vadim tudor in the second round ) . 
  calling it moldovan is not only rude , but extremely ignorant as well . 
  it is irrelevant where the language started , it was standardized as romanian and moldova uses the exact same standard that was used in romania before 1993 ( before \u00e2 and sunt ) . 
  the republic of moldova is an artificial state created by accident after the dissolution of the ussr . 
  it has no legitimate claim to the former principality of moldavia . 
  the romanian side of moldavia has 6 million people , the moldovan side has 3 million . 
  even the name itself comes from a river , which is located in romania . 
  moldovan existing as a separate identity from romanian is bullshit created by the soviet bullshit factory and is only believed by brainwashed ignorant people who ca n't tell their face apart from their ass . 
  i 'm sure not even dodon believes that bullshit , after all , he is somewhat educated , his mother is a romanian teacher and his children study in a school where most teachers are pro-romanian . 
  he just keeps saying that rhetoric because it fits his electorate , composed of soviet nostalgic 70 year olds and borderline retarded people like a glove . 
  it 's kind of like romanian . 
  the soviets actually went around moldova and tried to standardize `` moldovan '' by picking different regionalisms and making them official words . 
  the resulting monstrosity turned out to be useless , as no one understood it , so then they just took standard romanian , replaced the alphabet with the cyrillic script ( which was n't much of a problem since most people were illiterate back then anyway ) and called it moldovan . 
  that would be the most epic troll donny could pull out without completely fucking up the world . 
  however , in the case of dodon , this joke is expired , it was made up by the russians in the early 1930s . 
  the differences are basically as big as between british english and american english . 
  it would be like trump declaring the official language of the us being american . 
  a funny thing i noticed about moldovans , is that they speak romanian but tend to curse in russian , while the russians in moldova speak russian but tend to curse in romanian . 
   salat\u0103 de boeuf ( beef salad ) is a traditional romanian dish , generally served during all festive and special occasions . 
  it is a combination of finely chopped beef or chicken and root vegetables , folded in mayonnaise and finished with mur\u0103turi , pickled vegetable garnishes . 
  it can be made vegetarian , too . 
  i thought pretty much everyone agrees all isil members should be burned/shot/bombed etc , the implementation of that has been troublesome though . 
   in 2013 , the constitutional court of moldova ruled that romanian is the official language of the country . 
  however , the newly inaugurated president of moldova , igor dodon , claims the official language is moldovan . 
   if , until now , visitors to the moldovan presidency website could choose between romanian , english and russian , starting with dodon 's first day in office , presedinte.md is available in moldovan , english and russian . 
  fun fact - dodon 's own mother is a romanian teacher . 
   i make a difference between those who form the opinion and design the policies and those that follow them . 
  i do n't . 
  mother nature has given us a thing called a brain , which we 're supposed to use . 
  if they were some random conscripts i would understands , conscripts may or may not agree with their leaders policies . 
  but these people were part of the propaganda machine , they were professionals and i 'm pretty sure they were also pretty damn proud about what they were doing . 
  they were not going there to provide some innocent entertainment , they were going there to raise the morale of troops who need that morale in order to be able to continue killing people every day . 
  and they are killing people not even defend their own country , which would be understandable , but they are killing people in order to help putin wave his dick on the international stage . 
   likewise i would n't be happy if the guys in st petersburg that fabricate fake news all around the world would be dead i would be . 
  nobody forced them to work there , they chose to because they get more money than they would get for a normal job . 
  they are knowingly spreading lies and manipulating opinions . 
  they are making prostitution look like a respectable job . 
  did you cry when your friends shot a civilian plane from the sky ? 
  you got ta be fucking kidding me `` artists and charity workers '' is that how the russian propaganda machine is called now ? 
  yeah , sure , i have a mental illness for not feeling sorry the russian propaganda machine just lost a bunch of people who were on their way to entertain a bunch of murderers who kill random civilians , including children , like its nothing . 
  actually i do feel sorry , i would have been happier if it was dmitry rogozin 's plane from yesterday . 
  it was a military plane with the red army 's finest propagandists on board heading for fucking syria . 
  how am i supposed to feel sorry for that ? 
  when they shot the mh17 which was ** civilian ** plane they did n't even apologize . 
  fuck that shit !, 
  because they 're smart enough to know that as long as they go after nobodies like you or me , nobody will give a shit , whereas if they go after a vip there will be repercussions . 
  that 's so lame , that guy gets shot like several time , has a grenade blow up right next to him and does n't die . 
  oops , you 're right , i fucked that up . 
  the liberal-democratic party of moldova , the liberal party and the communist party of the republic of moldova will not take part at the inauguration ceremony of igor dodon . 
  the leader of the communist party , inna supac , said her party does not recognize the legality of the presidential election , thus considers the president is not legitimate . 
  the liberal and liberal democratic parties will also not take part in the ceremony , due to dodon 's statements that the republic of moldova should apologize to transnistria for the 1992 war , but also because he congratulated the new unrecognized leader of transnistria . 
  i do n't understand how the fuck merkel stands any chance of being reelected . 
  i mean , i understand , people make mistakes , politicians make are just people , it would be dumb to assume they do n't make mistakes . 
  but normally , when you make a mistake , you stop , take a step back , try to figure it out , repair the damage somehow . 
  with germany , it 's like they do n't want to admit they made a mistake , they just keep pushing and pushing their shit until it will eventually turn into a complete clusterfuck . 
  you should stfu , it was two israelis ( moshe klughaft and sefi shaked ) who coordinated the psd election campaign .

  adrian nastase was rumored to be both gypsy , as well as gay . 
  i voted for usr , lol . 
   look , as long as she is not stealing and not lying she 's was a nobody , never really heard of her before , but the press says she is close to liviu dragnea and nicusor constantinescu , both disgusting convicts .
