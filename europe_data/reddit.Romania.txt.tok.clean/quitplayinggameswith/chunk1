there is , although the law which makes 11 years of school compulsory was introduced 4 years ago . 
  before 2012 , school up to the 10th grade was mandatory ( that means 10 years ) . 
  since the first year of school , which did n't even exist before 2012 ( it can be compared to the english reception/year 0 and it is included in those 11 years ) , it is unlikely that people who graduated from mandatory school ( 10 years ) will need to study for one more year to get that licence . 
  5-6 years of age ( it used to be 6-7 until 2012 ) to 16-17 years , additionally , the final 2 years of high school are not compulsory . 
  since these 11 years ** include ** the first year of school , which was introduced 4 years ago ( `` preparing grade '' = * clasa preg\u0103titoare * , prior to the 1st grade ) , it is unlikely that people who have graduated from mandatory school after the 10th grade ( school from the 1st to the 10th grade is still considered as mandatory education , along with the preparing grade ) need to go for one more year to school in order to get a licence . 
  the uk is not a federal state , although it is divided into 3 legal areas : england & wales , scotland and northern ireland . 
  and even wales has legislative powers on other matters . 
  because it 's not even a part of the uk ( it 's a british overseas territory in the european union ) , and it has the right to make its own laws regarding marriage ( like scotland has - same-sex marriage in scotland was introduced a year after england and wales approved it , and northern ireland still does n't have same-sex marriage ), 
  85 % of romanian students learn french ? 
  if we take away the percentage of students learning spanish/italian/whatever , german is studied by 10 % or so of students here . 
  * mehrere sch\u00fcler sollen deutsch in rum\u00e4nien lernen * , it 's not that hard a language to learn !, 
  sorry , had read * first * . 
  we 've had another pm already sentenced : adrian nastase . 
  something like that , indeed . 
  but the documentary clearly had a bias , a left-wing one . 
  i watched it , i 'll only give a very short summary though : it 's about the life of several roma people from countries such as the czech republic , slovakia and hungary in canada , having claimed asylum . 
  a family went to canada before , willingly left for hungary , a child was born between leaving and returning to canada , they clung on to that child 's asylum application in order for the whole family to stay , it was rejected because * roma people in hungary are not systematically persecuted and they can be protected by the authorities * , and then they appealed on compassionate grounds . 
  it also shows a football club in hamilton , ontario , with roma people who 've claimed refugee status - some of the players were deported . 
  it also shows another family , a hungarian one , who went to canada in 2000 , claimed asylum , got rejected , and they were forced to return in 2002 , after a tearful good-bye party where a ` good luck ' cake was brought ( this family 's images are black-and-white ) . 
  the documentary was filmed in 2011 . 
  exactly , and i mean * exactly * the same as former prime minister victor ponta 's tactics in the presidential election of 2014 , it 's needless to say he went on to lose by a 10 % margin in the runoff ( and he was the favourite ! ) . 
  with tactics like this , there 's a probability the afd will lose in popularity . 
  not much , but there may be a fall . 
  it 's not likely they 'll be in government ( i suppose a new cdu/csu-spd coalition is the most likely based on current polling , followed by cdu/csu-grune and spd-grune-linke . 
  cdu/csu-fdp is unlikely if the fdp does n't rise enough so the parties have at least a majority of seats between them ) at all . 
  well ... who is going to check whether a person is coming to britain for pleasure , business or work ? 
  after all , he/she might find a job ( either in a newspaper on on the internet ) and circumvent the rule by taking a ferry/plane to france , ireland or wherever in europe , and returning the same day or the day after . 
  i wonder whether this would mean a spike in euroscepticism in ireland , this may be a stupid question indeed but will ireland become a more eurosceptic nation and consider leaving the eu after this decision ? 
  the netherlands . 
  because you can get by pretty easily using only english until you learn the language . 
  i have already explained the difference between de jure ( under the law ) and de facto ( in practice ) . 
  de jure , it was decriminalised , de facto it was still an offence . 
  and i said that i agree with you that lgbt people were still being punished in practice using a loophole in the revised article 200 which speaks about a ` public scandal ' . 
  this map shows changes in laws . 
  so it is not entirely wrong to show that romania decriminalised homosexuality in the 90s . 
  same-sex relationships were ** legalised ** in 2001 , when article 200 was repealed . 
  there is a difference between decriminalising and legalising something . 
  the 1996 revision of article 200 was not entirely meaningless , it was at least a * de jure * ( under the law ) change , which was largely enacted to soften romania 's relationship with the eu . 
  * de jure * ( under the law ) they were not , * de facto * ( in practice ) they were , i agree with you on this . 
  a public scandal was generally assumed to be triggered by at least two or three persons outraged by a same-sex relationship seen by them . 
  there have been situations in which lgbt people were imprisoned because their neighbours had reported them to the police . 
  before 1996 , in the eyes of the law , ** all ** same sex relationships , including those in private , were criminalised . 
  in romania , it got decriminalised in 1996 ( when same-sex relationships in private and not causing a ` public scandal ' were not punished anymore ) , and article 200 itself was repealed under eu pressure in 2001 . 
  so you can say that romania decriminalised it in 1996 and legalised it ( because there is a difference between these two ) in 2001 . 
  thank you for the explanation , had thought refusal of schengen membership triggers the guillotine clause , at least that 's what wikipedia says . 
  schengen is not a requirement for eea membership . 
  schengen members who are not members of the eu ( norway , iceland , switzerland , and tiny liechtenstein ) are only associate members of the schengen agreement , and this is an optional part of the eea agreement ( justice and home affairs are not a part of the eea agreement ) . 
  norway and iceland joined schengen because they were in the nordic passport union ( sweden , denmark and finland did not want border controls with non-eu members of the nordic passport union , so the eu accepted the membership of norway and iceland in the schengen area ) . 
  switzerland , since it is not a part of the eea agreement , having a separate , bilateral agreement with the eu , accepted schengen membership after a referendum in 2005 . 
  had switzerland rejected schengen membership , it would have triggered the end of the bilateral agreements . 
  liechtenstein only officially joined schengen in 2011 . 
  but it had an open border with switzerland before that year , and since switzerland joined schengen in 2008 , liechtenstein was also a de facto member of the schengen area , with its only controlled border being the austrian one . 
  schengen is not a requirement for eea membership . 
  schengen members who are not members of the eu ( norway , switzerland , iceland and tiny liechtenstein ) are only associate members of the schengen agreement , and this is an optional part of the eea agreement ( justice and home affairs are not a part of the eea agreement ) . 
  in either november or december . 
  translation : '' the communication or spreading , by any means , of news , data or false information or documents , knowing that they are false , if by this the national security is threatened , is punished by prison with a length from one year to five years '', 
  there might just be a mechanism to kick a country out of the schengen area - permanent eu residence is only valid in the area , a permit given by hungary , for example , allows its holder to stay in other schengen countries for 90/180 days , and some other countries which agreed to recognise the permits voluntarily ( they did n't have to - romania allowed permit holders without a visa or a waiver to transit the country for 5 days only until 2014 ) , such as romania , croatia and bulgaria . 
  not valid in britain or ireland . 
  if any of the eastern european countries gives residence permits to everyone , and is kicked out of the schengen area , the permit will only be valid in the country that issued it . 
  that means that going to every single country , apart from the one that issued it , will require a visa or a waiver . 
  this has the potential of shaking the whole romanian political system , he is close to tariceanu , who himself is allied to the social democrats , while he is also closely affiliated to the national liberal party ( conservative ) . 
  the most affected party seems to be the social democratic party , and there 's already speculation of a pnl-pmp-udmr coalition ( pmp is the party of the former president basescu , udmr is the hungarians ' party , both in the epp ), 
  it 's not just the social democrats who may screw up things - conservatives ( pnl ) are just as corrupt . 
  apparently , most money will be given to moldova . 
  ( * the republic of moldova is the main beneficiary of bilateral financing through the roaid programme . 
  * ) along with grants ( we like to call them `` unreturnable loans '' ) and low-interest loans ( romania 's been able to borrow money more cheaply since it 's an eu member and the economic situation is more stable - a share of the money passes onto moldova ) . 
  it 's not hard to guess why moldova is the main beneficiary - the historical and personal links are stronger . 
  most romanians ( according to polls ) would like to reunite with moldova and there 's speculation of a referendum in 2018 ( at least in moldova , personally i 'd like to have it here too because the people deserve a say and deserve to have arguments debated and even if most people vote for reunification , people should be able to vote no - i do n't believe the yes campaign should get a free pass even if most romanians are for the reunification ) . 
  the other countries are all eu membership candidates or intend to apply for membership . 
  that applies to *** non-eu countries which are nonetheless eea members *** , such as norway and iceland . 
  liechtenstein had used the emergency brake for a time , but it was warned that it is not a permanent measure so it had to apply for a permanent provision , which was given due to its tiny size ( half the size of the isle of wight ), 
  well , i suppose it could be a way out for britain to stay in the common market , but i do n't think the quotas would be that high !, 
  `` 100 million trillion billion '' . 
  you really made me laugh with this one . 
  for the record , the uk could also have a swiss agreement . 
  no , it 's about a permanent quota , the permit system was reapplied in 2012 and lifted in 2014 as a safety measure for nationals of countries which had their restrictions lifted , before the referendum . 
  a permanent number has not been set though in the referendum , leading to speculation of a ` generous quota ' which would be freedom of movement in all but name . 
  it 's an extended 7-year derogation in the bilateral treaties , they can apply it for three more years if they need it . 
  there 's no emergency brake in eu law , but there 's a provision regarding the emergency brake in the eea agreement , but it 's never been used by any of the non-eu eea members , except liechtenstein which is a very tiny country , with a population of roughly 30 thousand people . 
  switzerland has also been able to temporarily restrict freedom of movement , through a reintroduction of working permit restrictions ( roughly the same way it was applied to eastern european nations ) . 
  i 've been thinking for some time about it , but i 've come to the conclusion that it 's not really worth it . 
  in the netherlands , as long as one party gets enough for one mp , it enters parliament . 
  in romania , there 's a 5 % threshold - which is n't too easy to cross even for the oldest of the newer parties . 
  local issues are n't really important , either . 
  the 5 % threshold per municipality applies too . 
  casting a blank vote . 
  which is ridiculous - the european party represents me while the romanian one does n't . 
  being able to vote for other countries ' parties would really help me make a decision ; if i could do so , i 'd probably vote d66 or radikale . 
  well , we 've officially got a liberal party , the alliance of liberals and democrats ( that 's its name ) , which is a satellite party of the social democratic party ( psd/s & d ) , which itself is a socially conservative , rather economically centrist party . 
  we 've got another party which claims to be liberal , the national liberal party ( pnl/epp ) , but who betrayed its ideology in favour of the epp . 
  it chose to remain in the liberal international , strengthening its unclear ideology . 
  so there 's no real choice , sadly . 
  no party represents my interests . 
  if only i had a decent liberal party to vote , i would vote alde if i could , but there 's no real liberal party here in romania so i am left with no choice . 
  it 's not a surprise that the conservatives won in transylvania , it 's long been a stronghold for them . 
  just like it 's not a surprise that the social democrats won in other parts of the country . 
  it 's been indeed a victory for the social democrats , and a disaster for the conservatives in bucharest - they won 15 % and are in third place . 
  what is interesting is that the political map is not that clear-cut as it once was . 
  social democrats have won previously reliably conservative counties in transylvania , and vice versa in the rest of the country . 
  a mayor has been re-elected from prison , and two have been re-elected while indicted yesterday ( one is a social democrat , one is a conservative and one is linked to the social democrats through former membership of a satellite party ),
