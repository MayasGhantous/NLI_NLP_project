[ why not both ?

   two large lgbt flags ftfy from the title i was expecting to see two very fat lgbt people visiting a church or something and i was wondering why was this a thing, 
  the other half is already trashed ... 
  could also apply for expats . 
  like have one flair for the home country and one for the country you work/live in . 
  as opposed to dual citizenship you could have like an `` e '' or something on the second flag . 
  i just like how iurie leanc\u0103 ( moldova 's pm ) seems to be whispering something into traian b\u0103sescu 's ( romanian president ) ear while viktor orb\u00e1n ( hungarian pm ) looks on very suspiciously or how the serbian pm seems to be eating the kosovo representative . 
   i 'd really love , if we stopped being right about russia ... 
  i 'd really love for russia to stop doing stuff like this . 
  i mean if poland is screaming that the russians are gon na land on mars or save those space sex geckos ( too late apparently ) i 'd love for poland to be right, 
  his story sounds fishy !, 
  how do you go by trains and buses from greece to the netherlands without any border checks ? 
  even if you choose to remain in the eu all times there are border checks at the greek-bulgarian , bulgarian-romanian and romanian-hungarian borders and i am pretty sure you need a visa to get into either romania or bulgaria ( possibly hungary ) . 
  also , how did he managed to walk across the greek-turkish border ? 
  i really liked [ this one .

  hence the comments regarding austrian food and czech wine, 
  i lol 'd, 
  yes but you only produce [ 45,000 tones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wine-producing_countries ), 
  as someone who lives in austria : that 's all they have :( and you can not eat wiener schnitzel everyday :(, 
  east european heaven : * the isp is romanian * the vodka is from poland * the potatoes are from latvia * the food is hungarian * the beer is czeck * the wine is moldavian * everything is run by the austrians east european hell : * the isp is hungarian * the food is austrian * the beer is moldavian * the wine is made by the czechs * there are no potatoes in latvia * ukraine handles nuclear energy * the poles drink all the vodka * everything is run by romanians east european hell v2 : ussr, 
  from this image it looks like he 's pissing on the dutch tulip , 
  they did . 
  in romania we had one suspected case . 
  turns out he had malaria but until the diagnostic was confirmed he was quarantined and his family was confined to their homes . 
  this is the most fucked up thing i have ever heard . 
  how is this racism ? 
   the woman , who lives in berlin and who was rumored to have just returned from africa a week earlier has it occurred to the author that she was removed because she traveled to an area where there have been reported cases ? 
   in the united kingdom , the body of a woman from the gambia who died after falling ill following a flight from the gambia to london was sequestered until it could be tested for ebola oh no , let us not take any precautions with a deadly virus because it might look racists . 
  lets wait and infect some people before we dare test a black woman who was ill after a flight from a country with reported deaths . 
  edit :  despite the pan-european panic , only one person is known to have died in europe from ebola . 
  maybe that 's because european countries actually take precautions like the ones the author is complaining about ? 
  imo ton should be watched by the secret service . 
  reasons : 1 . 
  ton has a hotmail account . 
  ton uses yahoo to search for news . 
  in an entire week ton somehow did not enter any porn site . 
  not even one . 
  this is highly suspicious . 
  i mean he did not even go to / r/watchitfortheplot / . 
  something is very wrong with ton . 
   romania 's centre-left government in romania plans ... just to be 100 % sure it 's about romania . 
  i agree with the idea of a federated europe . 
  but seeing how a lot of people disagree with it i propose the following name : the ** f ** ederated ** u ** nion of the ** c ** ountries and ** k ** ingdoms of ** europe ** edit : i 'm now trying to think of an abbreviation for `` europe ( ans ) fuck yeah '', 
  imagine how awkward the celebration will be in 111 years, 
  we do . 
  there are obviously a lot of american tourists so it 's a good market , 
  i think that , as a scot , *** you *** should decide what is the best way to ruin scotland edit : and i will accept your choise, 
  but how do you make goulash then ? 
  stereotype of romania we absolutely suck at : being the capital of italy :(,

  how will creating more jobs counter the populist wave ? 
  even if they admit that new jobs were created they 'll just gon na say the immigrants stole them edit : / s,

   moldova finally gets access to the black sea   and bucharest drowns win-win situation, 
   duck-beaked thing with tits . 
  then what do you call [ this ] ( http://theinterrobang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/duck-face-15.jpg ) in hungarian ? 
  if you look closely there is a / s at the end of the comment  / s, 
  liked the caption for the one of the photos  the damage was done with a saw , indicating that it was not a natural occurrence [ you do n't say !!!,

  gps works like that . 
  but there are sat nav devices that transmit your position . 
  google uses it to identify traffic jams and plans to have the device change the rote so that you avoid them ( do n't know if the have it already ), 
  we should have a / r/europe poll in parallel, 
  and some of the ones you mentioned are common with serbian and/or bulgarian dishes . 
  i actually posted this to show how common some food dishes are among this region . 
  it is however worth mentioning that sometimes the taste of a particular food is different . 
  for example , the mici are different than the ones i 've had in austria and the czech republic . 
  same can be said for the potato goulash with smoked meat . 
  for me , the hungarian goulash i had in hungary tasted totally different than the one i was used to ( and i liked both versions ), 
   but apparently texas is up for a referendum in the not too distant . . http://youtu.be/s92ftz_-kqe, 
  til [ the channel tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel ) is a blasphemy and a mocking of god , 
  the second you start to restrict the right to vote you open up a huge can of worms with the potential for even more restrictions . 
   people should be able to vote if they have a legitimate stake in the referred territory and how would you define legitimate stake ? 
  or who should decide if a person is legitimate ? 
  anyways , my opinion is that in many cases , the voting people outside the country are often more well informed and less politically biased than the ones inside the country . 
   the uk does n't need an aircraft carrier , we have several destroyers that can shoot down up to 200 of russia 's latest jets considering what happened to hms prince of wales ( and other ships ) i would have thought uk would learn her lesson . 
  and , yes , i know rocket technology is far better today than in ww2 but still , if the jets can sink your ship from several thousand +1 miles away would n't you need some sort of protection ? ^ not ^ trolling , ^ genuine ^ question edit : [ the range seems to be less than previously stated ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_45_destroyer ), 
  [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/sgypgbgdsue?t=1m59s ) [ what he deserves ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxloxugmrki ) [ regarding the situation in urakine ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lpqfmxmeg ), 
   england can escape the eu by the backdoor without anyone noticing you do realize that you can exit the eu any time you want , right ? 
  dam croatians , [ they stole our mps ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20130610ipr11414/html/elections-2014-share-out-of-meps'-seats-among-28-eu-countries ) , 
  all politicians be like : [ shit , run away , run away !!!!!, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/crvefoj.gif ) when will he be visiting north korea then ? 
  i agree with the receiving part . 
  but op should not really complain as romania is part of sepa and every time i have to send money from romania to austria i have to pay fees ( not the other way around ) . 
   i hope scotland has the will to get out of this and realize what shitty fee-culture they live under . 
  i hope scotland make a well informed and mature decision about its independence or uk status . 
  i really hope they do n't get out of the uk just because they have to pay fees also , as / u/bananus _ magnus points out , read the wiki first, 
  op has clearly not read the formatting help section  edit . 
  also : go sweden !!!!, 
   they 're a shoe-in for membership if they pursue that . 
  i 'm not that sure about the `` shoe-in '' part . 
  obviously it would be easier than countries such as serbia , turkey or moldova ( since they were previously part of the eu ) . 
  but you have to consider the politics out there . 
  each eu member has to give its ok vote in order for them to join . 
  and some countries may be facing similar prospects and might see denying entrance to the eu as a strong message to other such movements .
