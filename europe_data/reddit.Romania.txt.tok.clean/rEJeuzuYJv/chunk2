  you also have to talk about the `` parent '' country . 
  maybe not all are happy to lose clay . 
  someone really needs to invent a decent [ smell-o-vision ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smell-o-vision ) asap . 
  although this would probably be one of the last thinks i would try on it , 
  can you please put a youtube link after this happens, 
  just checked the [ prague zoo ] ( http://www.zoopraha.cz/en/ ) . 
  and yes , they have a [ giraffe ] ( http://www.zoopraha.cz/en/animals/come-and-meet/7591-rothschild-s-giraffe ) . 
  better hide her , 
  just watched that without sound . 
  thought mel gibson was getting a blowjob , 
  [ to all lithuanians ] ( http://i1299.photobucket.com/albums/ag70/syifaun/meme/i_know_that_feel_bro_by_rober_raik-d4cxn5a_zps8a0eb9a5.png ), 
  i 'll take your word for it . 
  have n't seen the sky in a long time :( ... at least its finally snowing , 
  is n't thedailymash a satire website ? 
  i 've seen many posts on / r/worldsatire /, 
  this was a big tourist attraction in brasov , romania for a while . 
  i think they removed the bears for safety reasons .

  the ~ ~ anschluss of moldova ~ ~ bilateral reunification requires some sacrifices on our part, 
   that 's just what we need , anti-immigration martyrs good point on this one . 
  never thought of it that way . 
  on the subject of immigration , as a romanian ( currently studying and working in another country ) i ca n't help but wonder at british tabloids papers and especially the comments there . 
  at first it was funny , the whole 29 mil ro&bg are going to come to the uk to get out benefits ( the combined population of the two countries is less then that ) . 
  nowadays its king of boring ( same rhetoric , nothing new ) . 
  maybe , instead of focusing on the rampant racists who comment they should focus on the people that actually plan to immigrate there ( both the good and the bad ) and as you said on plans to help them better integrate . 
   if you go around saying ` the holocaust was n't real , jews deserve to be killed ' in a public place which is what it essentially was , you have every reason to be expected to be called out on it . 
  i 'd expect you 'd be called a moron . 
  but as long as you do not act on it , as long as there is no direct proof that you saying that caused someone else to act on it than its still your right to say it . 
  even if 99.99999999 % of your society considers you a huge moron for saying it . 
  also , the whole holocaust/kill jews thing is going to the extreme side of it . 
  my issue , expressed better by / u/trucidator is the public shaming of these people . 
  by posting their names , faces and ** the place they work ** they are essentially saying : here are some people who we think are morons , go ahead fire them , beat them , shame them . 
  this is a problem because when you start doing this for extreme views you will not stop there . 
  again , as long as they did not physically harm someone or as long as they did not inspired others to do so they are still entitled to their idiotic opinion . 
  my opinion : this is bad , very bad . 
  it contradicts the right to free speech . 
  anyone should be entitled to express their own opinion regardless of what that opinion is . 
  whether you are pro/against immigration , gays , religion ( s ) , countries or science ( global worming for example ) you should at least have the right to say it . 
  if their opinion does not reflect the majority then they already lost . 
  what is the point of publicly humiliating them ? 
  just one question : how many of them do you think will lose their jobs because of this ? 
  just because they expressed an opinion that is unpopular with the majority . 
   after the tobacco reform of july , when tobacco shops became the only points of sale for cigarettes , fidesz realized they fucked the measures up , and out of the 6300 shops in the country , 2500 are near bankrupt due to low sales does this mean that the overall sales of cigarettes dropped in hungary ? 
  if so it might be a good thing to implement here as well . 
  to be honest i would probably suck at placing the us states on a map of the usa . 
  would get the most of the well known states right but as for the rest i would have no idea ... 
  the article reminded me of the [ reverse cowgirl ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/episodes/s16e01-reverse-cowgirl ) south park episode . 
  [ here 's why ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq-g4hatic8 ), 
  [ did n't they do that in 1776 ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sszj6099yy ), 
  only now saw that the topic was [ posted previously ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r23wv/student_loans_to_bulgarians_and_romanians_frozen/ ), 
  i see google translate is just as successful in translating hungarian as it is with romanian . 
  i think not , 
  [ yes it is , very good ] ( http://www.bucharestnotbudapest.com/ ) . 
  i think the funniest confusion between the two capitals was [ this one ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/atheltic-bilbao-fans-arrived-at-budapest-829834 ), 
  do n't tell me some romanian stole your pun too , 
  have n't they done that back in 1997 ? 
  and then bruce willis tried to kill the first lady but was stopped by richard gere ? 
  source : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119395/, 
  yeah , that sounds nice . 
  we can have all those '' * what do you know about country x * '' , '' * what do you like about country x * '' and '' * what happened in your country * '' threads there for a start . 
  seems more appropriate . 
  yes , because those two always go well together , 
  yeah , you 're welcome , 
   i think he is running for president in 2016 . 
  are you saying that in 2016 usa might have a president king ? 
  or a commander-in-chief rogers ? 
  best clock ever !!!, 
  something tells me that if aliens attack europe poland will be the first to get attacked, 
  and i thought you will just vote for the ukgip , 
  what if they beat portugal and iceland beats croatia and they end up in the same group at the world cup playing the first game . 
  in that case he used `` then '' correctly , 
  he probably means [ flat tax ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flat_tax ) . 
  am i right / u/lolkac ? 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_income_tax ) one probably ... 
  good for you !!!, 
  we hope someday to have that belief as well . 
  but it seems to be somewhere in the far far future :(, 
  i wanted to say that you misspelled romania in the title . 
  the i realized you can just say :  x - where 100 % of the politicians are corrupt and lobbyist and 50 % of the population are brainwashed . 
  and replace x with the country of your choice, 
  poland can not into first place . 
  if we wok hard romania can ... 
  our respect for you guys . 
  we need to do this in romania more often !!, 
  good for you . 
  in romania we had a guitarists from a famous band killed by an american diplomat ( he was a soldier with immunity ) and we could not prosecute . 
  as a coincidence he was found not guilty in the usa ( after ignoring 2 stop signs ) . 
  we had a similar problem ( drunk diplomat ) with a russian diplomat . 
  the police could n't do anything as he invoked his immunity, 
   strays exist throughout romania , but the bill only allows euthanasia in bucharest . 
  the bill was approved by the parliament and is now nation wide . 
  i do n't really see what all the fuss is about . 
  other countries do the same thing . 
  in canada the time is 4 business days , in romania 14 . 
  why is it everyone does this but when we do it we 're looked upon as some sort of savages ? 
  edit : checkout the laws in denmark on this subject ... 
  post the result on / r/europe . 
  i 'm interested to see the comparison edit : when the results are ready , of course, 
  apparently , we like to stargaze a lot in romania
