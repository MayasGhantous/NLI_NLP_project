he 's not that wrong , to be honest . 
  a lot was did with the money , but many more could have been done . 
  so , leaving room for more pawny moves . 
  caracal is already a classic , vaslui represents the new-age . 
  [ are you sure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dumitru_prunariu ) ? 
  looks like pictures gathered from / r/gonewild and a few other similar subreddits . 
  rather unexpected , to be honest . 
  let 's put it simply . 
  why would you send 100 trucks that are 2 % full when you can send 5 trucks that are 100 % full and let 's say , two more empty trucks as back-up ( as i 've read earlier through the topic ) ? 
  well , [ he did n't dress bad at all ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/brodskiy%27s_lenin.jpg ) . 
  there were some really terrible sculptures added on that pedestal in the past . 
  also , is there any solid info about what will be added there as a permanent display ? 
  maybe , but 100mbps goes to 12,5 mb , so it would be improbable to do this . 
   local government to pretty much stop any development i really hate when this happens , regardless of the domain of activity where the event occurs . 
  one of the many cycles of life . 
  i 'd die a bit inside if i were to experience issues like this . 
  i often read on reddit that americans have to face throttling , especially on popular websites like netflix and it would be terrible to pay for an overpriced service and still get half of it . 
  our regulations are still pretty permissive , or at least this is how i see things after all these years and an isp that would start throttling would easily lose customers . 
  / u/monghai gave you a link , but that 's not really representative for the majority of the countryside . 
  in the cities , we have about 75 % penetration of internet , so the countryside average should be at around 25 % if the total is just a bit over 50 % . 
  far too less education makes it difficult to bring internet in a place where people literally shit in a hole at the back of their yards . 
  if these basic problems , such as that of paved roads and sewer system would be solved , the countryside would step up the game and people will likely be more inclined to research new things . 
  they start out with the toilet and then they discover the internet . 
  depending on the number of isps in your area , it might be actually good . 
  as it was said already in this topic , most romanian cities face a competition between three major isps . 
   in the real world , fiber is not 100mbps but more like 25 . 
  i pay for 100mbps and i get close to 95mbps download , so i do n't know which is the real world you are referring to . 
  rcs&rds provides free switches from 50mbps to 100mbps and from 100mbps to 200mbps . 
  it depends on where you live . 
  since when secondary school does not feature a three-month holiday ? 
  you can get three months of holiday ( or even more ) even during faculty . 
  considering it 's just at the borders of the european union , i find it enough of a reason for us to take a look at what is happening . 
  when it happens in mexico or in the middle east , we do n't really care , but at least now we should be concerned , that war crimes happen just next to us . 
  i find it not only a case of historic non-accuracy , but also a case of historic scarcity when it comes to information . 
  i finished high school one year ago and after 9 years of history classes , i would n't have learned too much if it were n't for individual study . 
  history books are always the same , even if a new edition appears and so on and i do n't know when the system would change . 
  i find it really unhealthy to study one year about the antiquity and come back later with two pages about the second world war . 
  no , i can find it that cheap in mega image supermarkets in romania . 
  that price is for a 300g loaf of bread that is baked in the supermarket 's bakery . 
  i 'd love to home bake my bread ( i had the opportunity to eat such bread a few times in the past ) but as a student , i hardly have time for such a luxury . 
  jokes on you , i can find bread that costs even 18 eurocents . 
  but why is the situation like this ? 
  educating people over 40 or 50 years old who live in a rural environment is rather difficult , in my opinion . 
  on one hand , the message could hardly arrive in a pure form to them , without being biased by a television or another , as it happens with the majority of the romanian ones . 
  on the other hand , people that do not have at least a basis of politics might not really understand the impact of a candidate 's action . 
  people still care about their own good and they also go along with the `` he did good for the village , there is no need for someone else '' and similar thoughts . 
  a few improvements in the rural life can easily act as a sponge in order to remove the stains from one leader 's life . 
  this , and electoral campaign bribery , of course . 
  apolitical persons might be a solution in order to educate people , but they would be quickly classified as biased by others . 
  because there are voices who ( to an extent , legitimately ) question the independence of certain organizations , agencies and so on , all of them lose credibility when trying to inform people about a certain matter in a transparent way . 
  the problem is actually on the public 's side . 
  going over what / u/poke133 says , that the anti-corruption agency ** may be ** a political tool , the majority of people who vote are uneducated in the field of politics . 
  they are not capable of doing research in order to know more about the past of a certain politician and their vote goes towards the one who gives them more flour and sunflower oil . 
  political campaigns are a great way to back yourself up with the aid of a few `` electoral buckets '' that work as a cheap and somehow , legal bribery . 
  if ukraine enters the eu , i wonder what would happen to moldova , as they are still ... linked to the russian federation . 
  they wo n't have anymore such a direct link ( as ukraine is a geographical bridge and not only ) and maybe moldova could also start its journey towards eu . 
  unfortunately , no . 
  the books are newer and there are mentions of romania and ue or nato , but again , nothing is detailed . 
  i wonder when the post-1989 history will be studied and how biased the displays of the events will be . 
  i was never a fan of radio , but in the past there were quite a few radio stations that were worth listening to . 
  nowadays , the mainstream radios feature the same music , the same hits that i am really sick of . 
  there is just one radio station that i honestly enjoy listening to , ** radio guerilla ** . 
  they tend to avoid all of these popular songs that are the hits of the moment and they have good quality songs in the playlist . 
  other than that , ** magic fm ** is a radio station that features older ( especially pre-2000 ) songs and it is also worth listening to . 
  ** radio romania actualitati ** is good for news , and that 's all about radio stations in romania , but my opinion is highly biased as i am not a fan of the newest pop hits or gossip shows . 
  if i relate to the history that is taught at high schools , as i just finished the 12th grade , i can say that the most emphasis goes on the middle ages , ranging from the xiv to the xvi century . 
  the least mentioned aspect of our history is romania 's participation in the second world war . 
  there are brief mentions of the antonescu regime and about the coup that took place at august 23 1944 . 
  overall , wwii is probably one of the least studied subjects in high school and i have yet to discover the reason behind it . 
  post-1989 history is not something that is talked about at school , you will never hear anything about the mineriads and their implications . 
  the revolution that took place in 1989 is also briefly taught . 
  the situation that is currently on the streets of turkey does not make me think that they fulfill the conditions . 
  this violent period will cease at some point in the future , but it will still leave a stain on turkey 's image . 
  nearly identical . 
  yellow and red are the same , while blue has different shades . 
  the hex code of romania 's blue is 002b7f , while the hex code of chad 's blue is 0c1c8c . 
  if they want to limit the powers of the president , why do n't they change the system from a semi-presidential to a parliamentary republic ? 
  in romania , we use pegi as a game rating system . 
  however , i would not go and talk about this as i find it that physical copies of games are rarely sold . 
  in the last four years i have only purchased fallout : new vegas as a physical copy and i plan to do so with only one or other two games that are cheaper than what steam manages to offer . 
  movies and shows have a rating system but i can not find its name . 
  every number or letter that is posted is encircled , but i can not write it like this here . 
  however : there are movies and shows with no ratings , those being the most child-friendly ones , such as the shows that are solely designed for them . 
  ( ap ) - i 'd translate this roughly to parental agreement . 
  children who are under 12 should watch shows along with an adult or after the adult allowed them himself to do it . 
  a lot of movies and shows have this rating , and even movies like home alone have it . 
  ( 12 ) - children under 12 are not allowed to watch these shows . 
  i do not see too much of a difference between this and ( ap ) . 
  there might be some minor violence and harsher language during these shows . 
  ( 15 ) - children under 16 are not allowed to watch such movies and shows . 
  such movies are not porn or erotic , they do not feature strong violence and gore , but they are generally harsher than ( 12 ) movies , although i have seen a lot of movies that were n't supposed to use this rating . 
  ( 18 ) - our ole ' classic porn , but also erotic movies . 
  gore , such as in saw movies also falls into this category . 
  recently , the law has been changed and such shows are not allowed on tv earlier than 1:00 am and later than 6:00 am . 
  before this , you could have found such movies starting with 12:00 am . 
  these ratings do not actually mean too much . 
  this is because news bulletins provide much more shocking content than a ( 15 ) movie can . 
  we have a tv station , pro tv , and they have a series of news bulletins during daytime . 
  the one at 17:00 , however , is filled with news reports about murders , rapes , robberies and whatnot . 
  i find such a montage , even though it does not depict graphical content , much more shocking for a child than american pie , let 's say .
