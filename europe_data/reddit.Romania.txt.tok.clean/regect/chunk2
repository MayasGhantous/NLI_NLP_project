  are you going to read my mind to see if i did my mental calculations correctly ? 
  and as i mentioned before , how do we even decide whose happiness is worth more ? 
  this is a complex and nuanced issue , and i 'd appreciate it if you gave it the intellectual weight it deserves instead of berating the poor sod for having made his personal decision already . 
  why would anyone make a map that includes regions that were never in the country at the same time ? 
  if i recall , the transnistria governorate region with odessa was promised by the nazis as amends for stomaching the [ second vienna award ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award ) as well as `` temporarily '' ceding land in the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  the plan was that the lands north of the prut would be retaken and extended , as shown on the map , through [ barbarossa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) . 
  it should either look like the historical [ greater romania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/romania_1930_ethnic_map_en.png ) , which is by far the most prevalent and idealised nationalist map , or the [ real 1941 map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/recensamant_1941_judete.png ) . 
  also , in my opinion , even assuming a total axis victory in ww2 , these borders would not have stood for long . 
  romania would 've likely tried to have its cake and eat it too by challenging the [ newly enlarged hungary ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/hungary_1941_ethnic.svg/860px-hungary_1941_ethnic.svg.png ) for full control of transylvania . 
  funnily enough , it is only in this far-fetched hypothetical situation that [ this silly map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tfxt9jz.jpg ) makes sense . 
  consider your reply to / u/atred , which i totally agree with , that aromanian * ie * is simply ` it is ' ( * e * ) , while also claimed to have some kind of affirmative function in his dictionary . 
  now let us consider that many languages use [ echo responses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echo_answer ) alongside ` yes ' , some of them even exclusively so , including grandpa latin , as you also mentioned above . 
  these are so common in romanian that you would n't bat an eye if someone answered * ai fost la cinema ? 
  * ( did you go to the cinema ? ), 
  with * am fost . 
  * ( i did . ), 
  instead of * da . 
  * ( yes . ) . 
  my first hypothesis is either that aromanians generally prefer echo responses , or that they only have echo responses . 
  with that said , i think the dictionary / u/atred linked took the lazy way out when faced with this gap in a rare , endangered language and just put * ie * because it might be the most common verb to echo perhaps . 
  now assuming all these are close enough to being true , my second hypothesis is that ` yes ' was not as basic and common a term as you think it is . 
  both aromanian and romanian share the echo responses inherited from latin , but romanian had much more contact , forced or otherwise , with old slavic . 
  not that aromanians did n't have contact with nearby bulgarians , but romanian was surrounded by slavic speakers . 
  * da * could 've easily passed into common usage in romanian lands alongside the traditional echos because they are n't really competing concepts , in fact they can reinforce each other like most modern romance languages can attest . 
  of course this is all a house of cards argument and i could be totally wrong , but it was fun thinking about it . 
  yeah fuck tolerance !, 
  it was just a prank , bro !, 
  here 's a plausible timeline : 1 . 
  latin starts off only with the verb-repeating way of saying yes directly . 
  it also has a bunch of euphemistic ways of doing it , like * ita * , * etiam * , * sic * , and some other ones i ca n't recall . 
  vulgar latin varieties still mainly used verb-repeating , but these other words continue to exist , probably with some esoteric local connotations . 
  after all , how weird is it that * sic * ( * like that * ) came to mean * yes * in the west , but * and * in romanian ? 
  proto-romanian splits from its western siblings , and then at some point into aromanian and daco-romanian , which is where they stop sharing innovations . 
  note that verb-repeating has been kept to this day in all varieties . 
  ( daco - ) romanian innovates a direct way of saying yes , in this case * ita * -  * ta * \\* -  * da * , just like western varieties innovated their yes from * sic * or * hoc * . 
  i do n't know why they innovated this way . 
  maybe peer pressure from neighboring germanics/slavs ? 
  since there 's nothing wrong with relying on verb-repetition for your affirmatives , aromanian could 've simply skipped this step . 
  i think a whole lot of languages are this way ; it may even be that the yes/no languages are the peculiar ones here . 
  without such ubiquitous uses as * yes * or * and * or * if * , the original words were relegated to being fancy pants demonstratives like * indeed * , * thus * , * furthermore * in aromanian and over time were discarded or replaced by invading vocabulary . 
  personally , i do n't buy it , since the slavic root seems much more likely . 
  in fact , the previous argument can be turned around to support this view : since proto-ro started off only with verb-repeating , it would n't be that much of a bother for the locals to learn a new word ( * da * ) since it 's not competing with any other emphatic yeses/yesses , and then they could communicate with slavs more easily . 
  are you familiar with the phenomenon in history known as [ presentism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presentism_\\ ( literary_and_historical_analysis \\ ) ) ? 
  i read askhistorians often and it seems to be a generally well regarded rule of thumb when it comes to historical analysis . 
  here 's the first paragraph in the wikipedia article on it :  in literary and historical analysis , presentism is the anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past . 
  some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of cultural bias , and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter . 
  the practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common fallacy in historical writing . 
  if you have some time , could you please explain the differences , if any , between the viewpoint you were outlining in your post above , and the concept of presentism as laid out in said wiki article ? 
  it is n't , the english cognate is to adhere and adherence . 
  in esports , koreans who move to the west are also known for having a weird inability to cope with a lack of korean food . 
  it 's possible that despite the availability of foreign foods , many choose to ignore them . 
  it 's a trade off between efficient decision-making ( dictatorship ) and representation with consent ( democracy ) . 
  when the romans were in a time of crisis , they valued a dictator over the senate because quick , decisive action was agreed to be more important than careful deliberation that sought the most optimal outcomes for the senators ( the voting class ) . 
  in times of peace , it was the opposite . 
  a benevolent dictator is the hypothetical combination of these , which is an individual that makes quick decisions that also correspond to what the voting class would 've decided if given unlimited time to deliberate and think . 
  the main downside is that once this one-in-a-million individual dies , it 's almost certain that his successor will fail to live up to expectations and degenerate into a regular dictator , so benevolent dictatorship is not a long term solution to the problem of good governance . 
  however , in the short term it 's better by definition . 
  how are they lower than animals ? 
  even if i 'm being charitable with that interpretation , i 'd put them at the same level at worst . 
  my favourite subtitle translation of `` fuck ! '', 
  was from the film ultraviolet ( 9 % rotten tomato rating ) , where it was `` futu-i ! '' . 
  surprisingly accurate !, 
  think of it like collective bargaining in the context of labour unions . 
  it is , but the status quo is too entrenched to be swayed without strong enough one-way arguments . 
  anybody else notice the derpface-like microtits on the mural in the last pic ? 
  a few random counterexamples : ** saxony **  the names saksamaa and saksa are derived from the name of the germanic tribe of the saxons . 
  [ ... ] in finnish and estonian the words that historically applied to ancient saxons changed their meaning over the centuries to denote the whole country of germany and the germans . 
  ** ionia **  the second major form , used in many languages and in which the common root is `` yun '' or `` ywn '' , is borrowed from the greek name ionia , the ionian tribe region of asia minor . 
  in greek , these forms have never normally been used to denote the whole greek nation or greece . 
  ( examples : al-y\u016bn\u0101n , yunastan , yavana ) ** cathay **  this group of names derives from khitan , an ethnic group that originated in manchuria and conquered parts of northern china . 
  due to long domination of northern china by these nomadic conquerors , it was considered by northwestern people as the land of the khitan . 
  ( examples : \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439 in russian and similar in other east slavics + bulgarian ) i do n't consider it a problem that the netherlands are called holland sometimes . 
  just out of curiosity , are you one of those people that takes offence when us citizens call themselves americans ? 
  you said it , bro !, 
  i can praise a good swimmer for swimming well . 
  i can also praise a bad swimmer for having the foresight to find a better route for himself around the water . 
  the first thing i thought of was the liberum veto , and that turned out great . 
  sorry to interrupt , i just wanted to ask : do n't you think `` who 's in the party '' is an issue some might find important ? 
  that 's a motto i would put my life behind , to be honest . 
  i interpreted it as saying that you can think people are wrong or have a wrong worldview without thinking they 're stupid . 
  you probably think the person you 're replying to is wrong , but would you say he 's mentally buggered because of it ? 
  yeah but who qualifies as a human depends on culture . 
  ideas that lead to acknowledging untermenschen or principles like the three-fifths compromise can be a bit picky when it comes to handing out personhood status . 
  you would think so , but this exact argument was had when croatia seceded from yugoslavia back in the day . 
  milosevic said , `` how would you like it if serb regions seceded from * you * ? 
  '' , and croatia replied that those regions lacked appropriate representation . 
  eventually it came down to war . 
  agreed , with everything except the last sentence . 
  the precise reason may be irrelevant morally , but it gives us a sociological data point . 
  what about john rawls , who described the opposite ? 
  it 's not a settled issue , you know . 
  what 's with all the sarcasm in 1 ) ? 
  is that not a reasonable view , that the average white american is n't as smart or hardworking as their asian immigrant counterparts ? 
  not in the sense he means . 
  in romanian and french , for example , its cognate just means protest or demonstration . 
  in english , it 's more literal and general because it means to make visible or evident . 
  you could say that the aurora borealis is a manifestation of solar wind in earth 's magnetic field . 
  the metaphor is still possible in english , though . 
  protests are a manifestation of people 's discontent . 
  the big difference is that this meaning has crystallised in the other languages , to the point where the specific metaphor has superseded the general meaning .
