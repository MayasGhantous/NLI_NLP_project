hopefully they manage to pick up the ball we dropped , environmentally . 
   ~ ~ ponta 's ~ ~ dragnea 's speech after final exit polls was terrible . 
  ftfy . 
  ponta has been either an incredible pussy or incredibly arrogant , that he did not actually face the press afterwards . 
  he sent his second-in-command to make a statement . 
   it 's like voting for your favorite color while i agree with everything you said in your previous posts , i got ta say , this bit is the most depressing . 
  because it 's mostly true . 
  the even worse part is that all the parties , without exception , are full of the sort of people who can and do think up obscure policies and amendments to laws that will basically allow them to do business with the state and thus leech public funds , when they 're not outright mediating such things for a fee , without even the pretense of law . 
  and that , children , is how you summon cthulhu . 
  just open the vault in the tomb .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding , ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  the matter is moot anyway , this was his last mandate . 
  he is . 
  he 's known on / r/romania as one of the more vocal detractors of the president and supporter of the current pm , who can do no wrong ( the education `` reform '' , public acquisition law , dismantling of various public institutions and his own plagiarism notwithstanding amirite ? ) . 
  there is strong suspicion that this poster , and several others , are actually paid strawmen , and some decisive action has been discussed among the moderators . 
  the oversight has been corrected -- now all links from / r/romania should be solid rather than dashed , 
  if it was n't for the weather ( cold ) and the language ( difficult ) , estonia would be my number 1 country of choice to immigrate to . 
  given the plethora of examples set by formerly-famous women , i 'd say music video + sex tape , but maybe i 'm just a bitter cynic . 
  interestingly enough , it is sometimes used in romanian as `` missing '' , like `` ce-ai c\u00e2\u0219tigat ? '', 
  ( what did you win ? ), 
  `` fix pula . '', 
  ( fuck-all . ), 
  come to think of it , `` pula '' is the romanian `` fuck '' , grammar-wise . 
  [ relevant spanish magazine article is relevant ] ( http://www.eljueves.es/2013/05/29/58_los_usuarios_internet_solo_lee_titular_los_articulos_web.html ) ( * new study shows 58 % of internet users only read the titles of online articles . 
  [ it 's both ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_language#writing_system ) , actually . 
  it 's funny because `` pula '' is romanian for `` dick '' , and `` pakkopulla '' kinda sounds like * bag pula * , meaning `` fuck it '' . 
  [ edit ] it 's one of the reasons we love [ botswana 's currency ] ( http://i.imgur.com/07xp8dt.jpg ) and [ that one town in croatia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8pnrzfq.jpg ) . 
  i think he meant a bar in a port . 
  it 's where pirate captains generally recruit their crew . 
  `` shit , i know this name . 
  i * know * i know it . 
  did i see it in the ikea catalogue , or on a cd sleeve ? 
  shit , which one was it ... ? 
  ... shit , it was that village i took a trip to last week . '', 
  [ dude , really ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqyqtfudrqc ), 
  well , back during the 80 i did n't live in bucharest , and was too young to notice strays . 
  i 've lived in bucharest for about 18 years , and there was never a time that i remember when we * did n't * have stray dogs . 
  the problem is that whenever somebody tries to do anything about it , there 's a huge shitstorm from all types of ngos and such , claiming that killing them after a set period ( as is done everywhere else ) is somehow inhuman . 
  in fact there was a protest against such a law just the other day , and the news channels were full of people ( most of them women above 40 ) crying and literally fainting because aww the poor doggies . 
  oddly enough , when a pack of strays killed a 4-year-old kid ( the incident which started this campaign ) , everybody blamed the kid , his parents , and the owner of the lot where this happened . 
  it was n't in any way the fault of the people ( private individuals and ngos ) who feed the strays instead of adopting or killing them . 
  you might notice i 'm very much * for * killing the strays , mostly because i like to pretend i live in a fucking * civilized * country . 
  yeah -- / r/romania is full of ro\u0219ia montan\u0103-related posts , reflecting most people 's views . 
  \\* * twitch * \\*, 
  well , as i was but a wee lad in the 80s , and given that my parents did n't swear ( either at all or just around me ) , i did n't know that . 
  thank you for the til . 
   numa numa song it 's actually [ moldavian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/o-zone ) , but other than that , spot-on . 
   forced industrialization , forced increase of literacy , great investments in education if it had n't been for these , my grandmother could n't have supported her mother and her son , all the way from birth to college , on a single factory worker 's salary . 
  so i pretty much owe my whole existence to communist education policies ( as my mother was one of my father 's students , after he became a professor ) . 
  good fuckin ' luck with that , though . 
  i love stephen fry * so much * . 
  yeah , it 's mostly a thing with people who were kids of very young at the time of the revolution , in ' 89 . 
  up until then , such language was rather harshly punished by the ( communist ) party , and since , people just took the whole `` freedom of speech '' thing and ran with it . 
  and being party of that demographic myself , i freely admit to using it . 
  not so much as i used to , for sure , but i still drop it every now and then , especially as an expression of discontent or bewilderment . 
  not because we 're offended , though , just on general principle . 
   ` pula mea ' or literally ` my cock ' , is an answer to every question in the universe . 
  examples : how are you ? 
  what do you want to eat ? 
  what is the mass of the sun ? 
  from the [ romanian urbandictionary  ( http://www.123urban.ro/def/pula%20mea )  my cock  extremely versatile expression , useful in a multitude of situations , among which :   1 . 
  expressing assent to an assessment * ( fuck yeah ) *  2 . 
  succintly expressing a long-winded but obvious answer to a questions * ( duuh ) *  3 . 
  as a reaction to a shocking statement or occurence * ( no fuckin ' way !, 
  as a general-purpose interjection * ( the fuck ! ... 
  as a swearword or part of one * ( fuck you ) *  6 . 
  as a reply to a greeting * ( yo ) *  7 . 
  as punctuation in a phrase or sentence * ( fuck ) *  8 . 
  as a general-purpose name for a far-away destination * ( fuckin far away ) *   ** examples **  1 . 
  `` that guy 's an asshole . '', 
   `` my cock ... ''   2 . 
  `` dude , did you manage to chat on that exam ? '', 
   `` my cock ! '', 
  `` dude , john fucked mary . '', 
  i do n't believe that . '', 
  `` my cock !, 
  those sneakers were new ... ''   5 . 
  `` suck my cock ! '', 
  `` what 's up , man ? '', 
   `` my cock , hangin ' around . '', 
  `` so my cock i went to this party and my cock there were no chicks there so i got my shit and cockin ' left . '', 
  `` so i went all the way to my cock to find some batteries . '', 
  that is the stupidest thing i 've heard . 
  no , sadly , i have n't seen it for a few month now ( i check every time i 'm there ... ), 
  that 's part of the 365 group , innit ? 
  mega image , another chain in the group , is all over bucharest . 
  to the point where there is a big one and two small ones on the same street . 
  it 's come to the point where a satire site published an article called [ bucharest man , back from vacation , finds new mega image store in his apartment ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.timesnewroman.ro%2fmonden%2f9949-intors-din-vacanta-un-bucurestean-a-gasit-un-magazin-mega-image-deschis-in-propriul-apartament ), 
  same in romania . 
  and some of the stuff , while weird , is excellent . 
  for instance , i never thought i 'd eat kangaroo steak . 
  it 's great . 
  amalgamated regional militia ? 
  i 'm sad to say , / r/europe is nowhere as awesome as that comic is . 
  some of these europeans seem almost not gay . 
  dude . 
  i 've got the weirdest boner right now . 
  i think [ this * yes , prime minister * clip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zzjxw4mta ) accurately portrays most polls .
