  obviously , if you had more government money , you could develop your region , and then you would n't need government money . 
  but since you need government money , obviously you 're not going to get government money . 
  simple politics . 
   we are special snowflakes . 
  oh they 're gon na love you on / r/tumblrinaction, 
  at least south americans have a good opinion on us ... 
  that 's exactly what happened here . 
  of all my friends , only my girlfriend has learned english in school -- the rest ( myself included ) relied heavily on cartoon network , mtv ( back when they had music and other stuff aimed at younger teenagers ) , movies and so forth . 
  since they 've started dubbing cartoons in romanian , the overall level of english fluency has dropped rather sharply . 
  in my case , it also helped finding an ftp with a bunch of sf/fantasy novels in english . 
  did n't do shit for my pronunciation ( for instance , it took me 4 years to find that when something goes `` awry '' , it goes '' * or eye * '' , not '' * orry * '' ) , but it expanded my vocabulary significantly . 
  hell , by highschool i actually knew english a tad better than the teacher ... 
  hahaha , like that one time the us decided osama bin laden was in iraq , and proceeded to invade afghanistan ? 
  yeah , that was hilarious . 
  wow , holland 's suddenly a lot more tropical than i remembered it . 
  ... just to see how it feels ? 
  * my * religion will have the best of both : one-and-a-half god ( s ) !, 
  while you do make a good point , i should say that lately , imo , most songs turned out sucky . 
  i mean frankly , the last eurovision song i really liked was lordi 's hard rock hallelujah , in 2006 . 
  then again , i 'm a rocker , so maybe that 's why . 
  but my overall impression is that they sound overproduced , and that kinda lowers the quality of the music . 
  also , romania 's entry is , in my opinion , shameful . 
  the guy has a great voice , but the song says nothing whatsoever . 
  also , surprise dubstep !, 
  because that 's what youngsters these days listen to , i suppose . 
  could be , pretty much all the tv channels broadcast it . 
  i saw it in romanian , italian and french . 
  or fort boyard . 
  it is the one thing that unites us europeans , across distance and culture divides : laughing at semi-talented people and their hilarious antics onstage . 
  the humor may be shitty , but generally their political investigations are spot-on ... 
  til margaret thatcher had n't died in the 90s , as i 'd somehow assumed until now . 
  with ponta 's track record , bezbojnicul 's better off not answering the phone ... 
  felicit\u0103ri , \u0219i happy cakeday , 
  yes , but i do it with european smugness and * panache * . 
  american pancakes , oddly enough , chased down with coffee and cigarettes . 
  it might as well be romania , though . 
  posting random pictures of my gorgeous facebook friends would be creepy , though , would n't it ? 
  `` sp\u00e4tzle '' sounds like a yiddish rude word . 
  `` oh , pay him no mind , morrie , he 's a sp\u00e4tzle . '', 
  [ good , good ... ] ( http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs20/f/2007/231/2/8/just_as_planned_by_kiriska.jpg ), 
  you mean the * good * kind ? 
   increase the size of your kebabs while lowering the price fun fact , a small shaorma ( that 's what we call it in romania ) in bucharest is larger and ( marginally ) cheaper than a large shaorma in my home town . 
  then again , [ shaorma is a huge industry ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.evz.ro%2fdetalii%2fstiri%2fce-se-pune-in-shaorma-979569.html ) in romania ( google-translated link ), 
  do you really think he can afford any marijuana ? 
  yes that was insensitive , and i do apologize . 
  so you 're saying that if i were to open a kebab place that also makes chinese-food-kebab , you guys will start throwing money at me ? 
   that 's because language death does not depend on how adapted it is . 
  it has to do with language policy in certain states , with perceived prestige and so on . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  i mean , i 'm not saying * you 're * mistaken , but imagine saying , in romanian , `` i-pak dau de veste domniilor voastre ... '' in every official communication from the government , because that 's how they did it in * [ insert your favorite historical ruler ] * 's time . 
   because hundreds of languages are dieing out fuck 'em . 
  there 's a reason they 're dying out , and that is that they 're used to express ideas that are n't as vital now as they were when the languages themselves were alive . 
  sure , you can invent new words in said languages , but i do n't think that saves them , but rather changes them . 
  for instance , how do you say `` you 'll receive an email with the download link after registration '' in latin , or gottscheerish ? 
  there 's probably a ton of words regarding sheep-shearing or whatever , but the vast majority of europeans probably do n't care . 
  me , i 'd much rather speak a language ( be it natural ( english for instance ) or constructed ( like interlingua or sindarin ) ) that expresses my current needs as efficiently as possible , to as many people as possible . 
  what is eurolang ? 
  ( i mean , can you provide links , examples , etc ? 
  because i figure it * is * what it says on the tin ) . 
  also , interlingua seems a really cool language , but to me at least , it sounds easy to understand but difficult to speak . 
  `` okay , i want to say this , but do i use a spanish root for the word , or a french one ? '', 
  yeah , they 're both informal in romanian as well , i guess i should have clarified . 
  in romanian we have `` gagiu '' , meaning `` dude '' ( not pejoratively , though it 's fairly rare ) , and the feminine `` gagic\u0103 '' , meaning either `` chick '' or `` sweetheart '' . 
  with a bit of luck , we might see her in one soon . 
  i 'm a bit worried that * you * might be serious ... 
  but yeah , that was sarcasm . 
  regarding the article linked : can you prove beyond doubt that tracey zetsche is not a muslim ? 
  no , you can not . 
  therefore muslims are bad . 
  logic !, 
  i 'd like to hear your thoughts on the [ code of hammurabi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/code_of_hammurabi ) ( ~ 1772 bc ) , in that case . 
  do n't laugh at me , man , i 'm pirating as fast as i can here !, 
  second table needs another column , `` pirating shit '' . 
  romania 'd be like 87 % . 
  obviously not , you sicko . 
  for most of us , austria = vienna = the sort-of affordable dream-vacation spot . 
  kinda like prague , but with less trouble ordering a beer . 
  well , it was * big * , lem me tell ya . 
   the first thing that people did was try to clear up the romanian/roma misunderstanding it 's become a reflex by now ... 
  from what little i 've seen of it , estonia 's reputation is very well-deserved . 
  seeing tallinn , at least , was a great experience . 
  also , i should mention i visited [ kiek in de k\u00f6k ] ( http://linnamuuseum.ee/kok/en/ ) solely for its name . 
  nice museum , though . 
   but i am certainly jealous and would also like democracy . 
  as do we all . 
  are you implying we can make scarlett johanssons now ? 
  because that is a disturbing thought . 
  imagine all the creeps dabbling in the whole celeb-pedo-incest thing ... and now i ca n't unthink that . 
  my first thought was `` what , laid side to side , or lengthwise ? '', 
  then i realized it was 1 * million * rather than 1 * meter * . 
  but ... we * already * have a north korea ... 
  but is n't the leader of modern turkey just shitting on everything done by the founder of modern turkey ? 
  like , what would ataturk think of erdogan ? 
   ust fucking despise the romani people who speak the language and have been born in the country , but still prefer stealing and misconduct , just because working with or for the white man is against their culture but when romanians say that , we 're racists and just do n't work hard enough to integrate them . 
  could we please have more content like this on / r/europe ? 
  while ekranoplans are awesome for a variety of reasons , i do n't see this happening , or becoming popular if it does . 
  i base this statement on the ** huge ** crowds of finns with estonian-bought booze taking the ferry back to helsinki . 
  they just would n't fit in a smaller craft , and the tickets would probably be more expensive as well . 
   they asked t. zivjov to approve the budget for the universities - 1 million and the prisons - 10,000 . 
  he looked at the paper and said `` swap the numbers ! '',
