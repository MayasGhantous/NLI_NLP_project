  `` but why ?!, 
  the students are our future ! '', 
  asked the minster ... 
  he said : `` well , we for sure are not going to be students ... '' that would n't have worked in romanian -- `` facultate '' means university , but is also slang for prison . 
  baroque architecture ftw, 
  that is an incredibly * bad * idea . 
  it 's freezing in cologne :(, 
  [ of course . 
  ] ( http://humoroutcasts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kevin-scanlon-1.jpg ), 
  not just any relatives -- the dead ones mostly . 
  does n't that encourage people to see every little thing as a personal * and clearly sexist / racist / - phobic * affront , that fully justifies a tantrum ? 
  and good luck firing such people , you sexist fucking pig . 
  standards of business conduct are oppression !, 
  thanksgiving . 
  black friday . 
  never heard of that here . 
  perhaps some halloween in the uk but that 's about it . 
  black friday has successfully been imported to romania . 
  it 's that wonderful night ( that seems to come around some 3 times / year ) when shops drastically cut the prices they 've been slowly inflating during the previous months , down to something like 80 % of their innitial values . 
  halloween is also very present , especially in speeches on how it 's a satanic celebration that 'll lead to the moral decay of our glorious nation . 
   the idea that fat/large people are `` normal '' and do n't have a very troubling , dangerous health issue is totally alien here . 
  i recall seeing a news story on this one guy , he weighed 200 kg ( ~ 400 lb ) . 
  thing is , he weighed that much because of some weird disease , and he was disgusted with himself and doing everything he could to shed the weight . 
  apparently in america he 'd have been a bit overweight , and offended if you suggested anything was wrong . 
   30c is too hot to go outside   only speaking 1 language . 
  or assuming that locals speak the same language as us when we are on vacation . 
  most people i know speak at least 2 foreign languages , and that 's the case everywhere i went to ( with the exceptions of france and hungary ), 
  they 're paid lip service to here in romania as well . 
  that said , my mother had to take part in a feminism-in-the-workplace seminar thing , and left in complete disgust . 
  apparently american feminists believe women are spineless idiots , who need to be told that they 're constantly oppressed ? 
  seriously ? 
  and this is a big issue that needs to be addressed ( but not actually solved ) in romania as well ? 
  maybe we 're more used to hardship , and yes sexism is a thing , but in the face of adversity , most women i know ( ages ranging from 18 to 90 ) prefer to take stock of the situation and fucking * solve * it , not cry that the big bad patriarchy is opressing them with dress codes or some shit . 
  true . 
  a friend of mine recently started going to a psychiatrist and claims to be much happier with himself than he was before . 
  while i 'm glad for him , i personally see my issues as being * my * issues , to be ( maybe ) shared with a very select few ( family , gf , and maybe 2 or 3 friends ) , but mostly to be dealt with on my own . 
  i do have trust issues , yes . 
  no , fool , it 's a football team ( in like , every former warsaw pact country ), 
  i 'd hoped that sort of mentality would be confined to tumblr . 
  gean\u00ff, 
  not true . 
  some of them are called giani . 
  we are cautiously optimistic . 
  corrupt politicians getting arrested seems like a good idea , but we have seen too many of these convictions come to nothing , to be fully confident that the system works . 
  as an example , one of the so-called `` local barons '' , was convicted to 1 year in prison for election fraud ( a lot of the people who voted to remove former president traian basescu from power turned out to have voted several times , and a lot of them were actually dead ( ie someone else voted in their name ) ) . 
  the conviction was suspended ( he 's still convicted , just wo n't have to actually stay in jail ) , then he ran unopposed as the leader of the social democratic party , won , and now is making a lot of noise about turning away from the past and reinventing the party as a force for justice and democracy -- while in effect barring local party leaders from power positions , while consolidating his own . 
  in an amusing turn of events , ion iliescu is the founder and honorific president of psd , a party known for its huge corruption scandals . 
  victor ponta , the prime minister who tried to silence the fact that his phd thesis was plagiarised from other sources and who is now himself being investigated on corruption charges , is also a member of psd . 
  my heart leaped worth joy reading that . 
  it 's about time, 
  you do realize you 've just invalidated your previous point , do n't you ? 
  i take it you work for a company where anindilyakwa is spoken exclusively ? 
  cause that 's a local language in australia . 
  the film [ congo ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0112715/ ) and [ the book ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) it was based on . 
  no , congo is where they had those white gorillas guarding the diamond mines . 
   most people do n't mean to generalize , 
  the main complaint about it is that it was funded with tax money , meaning we all had to pay for it . 
  the last government even have them a few million euros from the special emergency fund . 
  yes , part of it was funded with disaster relief money . 
  this is not about redditors being atheist jerks . 
  as a romanian , let me tell you , it 's not . 
  most people under 40 think the cathedral is nothing more than a huge ego project for that clown , the patriarch . 
  fuck that guy . 
  and fuck all the politicians who voted to finance the cathedral worth public funds , too . 
  he only sounds like he 's * kicking * you out cause he 's got no guts to * ask * you out . 
  branter ? 
  it 's because they 've never had prince polo . 
  i can see no other explanation . 
  by then moldova will be like `` the uk ? 
  fuck have * they * done for the eu ? 
  we 're not letting them in . '', 
  [ they do n't even need a bus ] ( https://youtu.be/xs3sfnantig ), 
  completely offtopic , if you like alternate history and doggerland , read stephen baxter 's [ northland trilogy ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/series/49789-northland ) . 
   speaking as an englishman i would feel rather annoyed with the snp if they did try and force this through you mean kinda like the scots felt when the english voted to brexit ? 
  remember , the first referendum failed because leaving the uk meant leaving the eu . 
  demolish the other half , build better cities , with blackjack and hookers !, 
  op has seriously misspelled the byzantine empire . 
  fingers crossed, 
  the main factor , imo , and in this particular case , was people shouting `` no violence ! '', 
  anytime someone seemed to get violent . 
  i guess having 50 + people around shutting down violent impulses puts a damper on any rioting . 
  yeah , fuck that guy and the better life he wanted for himself !, 
  hell , people took trains from the other side of the country to get to the protests , a few hundred meters on foot wo n't turn anyone back . 
  if anyone wonders , he 's the guy with the flashlight on his phone . 
  i honestly do n't think it 's something the mayor did , given that on thursday when i went to protest , it took me like 10 minutes to get from the underground to the surface ( 2 minutes on a normal day ) . 
  the crush of people was incredible , and last night there were more people than on thursday . 
  also , the 4 metro stations nearby were crowded but not * that * crowded ( when i passed through there , at least ), 
  if russia said that western media claimed the sun rises in the east i 'd still be circumspect . 
  hello adriang133 , your account has been created , and your password is ` -- ; drop table users ; `, 
  so basically , [ the culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_culture ) ? 
  because i 'd be * so * down with that . 
   romanians [ ... ] are attracted by jobs from this mighty industrial engine . 
  the problem is that a good part of romanians who go to germany do n't go there looking for honest work . 
  and i 'm not saying it 's just the gypsies , either -- being a scumbag and making one 's country look bad has nothing to do with one 's ethnicity . 
  okay , that 's a particular case , but it still only involves romania and hungary . 
  what nobody seems to have spotted is that le canard encha\u00een\u00e9 is a satirical newspaper . 
  then again , people have been known to over-react to articles in the onion , so ... 
  let me blow your mind , good sir/madam : here in romania most hypermarkets are open 24/7 , and the vast majority of [ small shops ] ( http://urbo.ro/sites/default/files/imagecache/photo-big/fotos/2010/36/1/139665/139665-75680-55828.jpg ) are also open around the clock , with salespeople working in like 3 shifts . 
  i should mention that this is the norm throughout the country , rather than an exception . 
  berlusconi would take issue with anything having to do with getting behind merkel .
