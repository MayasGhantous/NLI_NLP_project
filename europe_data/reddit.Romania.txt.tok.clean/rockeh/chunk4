  my serial number indicates i too have been manufactured in romania . 
  my religious views and sexual orientation are standard for my model . 
  more scottish women as the doctor 's companions ? 
  though i doubt any other woman could hold a candle to karen gillan ... 
   i just accept that scotland 's sovereignty 's a matter for the scottish to decide - there 's absolutely no reason for me to hold all that much of an opinion on it . 
  amusingly enough , that 's the very mindset we 've got in romania regarding the reunification with moldova . 
  whoever is offended by it , apparently . 
  hey , why did the chicken cross the road ?

  they were probably the exception -- the rugby players at my highschool were , admittedly , not the brightest of the bunch , but they were all chill dudes . 
  i used to hang out with them sometimes , when skipping classes . 
  to put this in perspective for any american readers -- these guys were a sort of `` jocks '' , while i was one of the `` geeks '' , being in the computer science class and the sort who 'd not pay attention in class due to reading a book . 
  there was never much of a divide between the `` cool '' and `` uncool '' kids , and the lines were drawn very arbitrarily -- stereotypical geeks were seen as cool because they listened to metal and could recommend the best computer games , the `` slick hair and expensive clothes '' crowd tended to play basketball and listen to opera ( no , really ) and the really smart and the knuckledraggers hung out with the filthy rich with no sense of disconnect on any level . 
   it is the strong sense of right and wrong and the idea that everyone should have the ability to live in peace and comfort and not live a life of fear where dying either from bullets or starvation are the options . 
  i 'm not saying that is n't so , but i find that both ironic and amusing , given that until a few hundred years ago , norway was better known for the rampaging berzerkers that 'd kill , rape and pillage anything .

  at the very least you guys could hook up a generator to ataturk 's grave , and get free energy by having him spin in his grave ... 
   amazon is a gold mine and their prices are good even for romanian standards . 
  also , [ there are free books , too ] ( http://hundredzeros.com/ ) . 
  mostly trashy romance novels , but what can ya do . 
   also i use the public library i think that species is extinct ( or at least endangered ) in bucharest ... 
  iirc , that was the apartment of the leader of a drug and/or prostitution ring , though i may be mistaken . 
  the door was metal , and unlike most metal doors , it was not hollow on the inside , but rather filled with packed earth ( do n't ask how they managed to fill it up , i do n't know -- if i did , i 'd do the same to my apartment door ) . 
  [ edit ] upon reading what i posted , i realized i 'm sort-of implying i 'm the leader of a drug and/or prostitution ring . 
  i 'd say it 's not the case , but that 's exactly what the leader of a drug and/or prostitution ring would say ... 
  protip : plenty of libraries have ridiculous discounts sometimes ; i 'll have to ask my gf ( a former bookstore employee ) exactly when this happens , but i can tell you that it 's totally worth it . 
  for instance , this past weekend i bought marion zimmer bradley 's * negurile * ( [ the mists of avalon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_mists_of_avalon ) ) , edited by nemira . 
  the original price was about 30 ron / book ( two volumes ) . 
  i got them for 5 ron / book .

  nobody said he 's incompetent -- if anything , he 's just been careless in his haste to make sure b\u0103sescu is removed from power . 
  yeah , except the `` law '' you invoke was passed post-factum , ie . 
  ponta making sure whatever he does * becomes * legal if it was n't . 
  that 's a gross oversimplification , granted , but that 's more or less what 's been happening . 
  also , i 'm by no means a fan of b\u0103sescu , but ponta seems to be worse . 
  op , repost on / r/romania for maximum damage , 
  but you got ta admit it 's pretty goddamn impressive . 
  ( and is even more so if you see it irl and realize how fuckin ' * big * it is . ),

  fun fact , in romanian slang , `` cancer '' means `` very cold '' . 
  `` ia-\u021bi o geac\u0103 , e cancer afar\u0103 '' = `` take a jacket , it 's fuckin ' cold outside . '', 
   fuck all maths and cunt science and all equations and whomever the fuck invented them .

  i need to get swiss citizenship so i can vote for these people . 
  ... for all the good that campaign 's done so far ... 
  precisely . 
  hence , learn chinese , not danish . 
  i 'm actually far more concerned about the chinese invading european markets than i am about the vikings invading the european mainland ... 
  well , czech , polish , slovak , slovene and bulgarian are all slavic languages , and a good deal of the people in eastern europe ( both in the eu and outside of it ) speak a bit of russian , due to the soviet influence . 
  5 motherfuckin ' languages : 1 . 
  your native language , because you sort of need this one to develop as a sentient . 
  english , because it 's the de facto international language . 
  a romance language . 
  chinese or arabic , because in 20 years , you 're gon na need that . 
  haha , fair point . 
  a huge clusterfuck , imo . 
  i mean , i 'd love to live in an actually united europe ( united sates of europe , as it were ) , but ethnic issues run deep ( think cyprus , on an europe-wide level ) , not to mention i can envision endless bickering on everything ( '' * \\ [ country at the other side of europe \\ ] * ? 
  what the fuck have they ever done for us ? '' ), 
  ftfy, 
  well , the thing is , more economically powerful countries ' opinions might carry more weight , so people in general would listen to what the english , french or germans have to say about the eu , and tend to dismiss countries with smaller economies ( or territory ) , based on the same sound logic that makes people think that more beautiful people are smarter . 
  just sayin ' . 
  it 's much weaker than the uk 's , which was my point . 
   likewise i rarely hear accusations of anti-europeanism aimed at iceland , norway , switzerland , andorra , monaco , san marino or liechtenstein and they are n't even members of the eu !, 
  i guess that 's because their economies are n't as strong as the uk 's . 
  also , you could fit andorra , monaco , san marino and lichtenstein twice over in surrey , and still have some space left , which is probably why most people dismiss them ... 
  i propose a new logo -- the reddit alien riding a bull . 
   transylvania was a part of hungary from 1000 to 1918 , up until the trianon treaty . 
  did n't know that . 
  but i must point out , whenever i was in hungary ( well , budapest ) and there were maps around town ( for instance , the tour dates of a band , with the dates on top of the cities on the map ) , it was greater hungary .
