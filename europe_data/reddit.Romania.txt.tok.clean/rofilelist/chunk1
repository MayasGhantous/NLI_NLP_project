  sincerely yours , ukip . 
  ^ jk ^ we ^ love ^ you ^ too , ^ mate !,

  i want a trade !, 
  our internet for your highways . 
  nice !, 
  [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6j1qwvi.jpg ) are mine , i always forget to buy them . . 
  in case you want to visit it , i 'll leave the [ basic travel giude to romania . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/wiki/travel ), 
  gut !, 
  i know it 's not the norm , i ocasionally go in various places to pick up trash . 
  i lived in germany for a while and the situation looks different there . 
  the main problems romania has : * people often lack the power of example , civic pride , and they are often just lazy ; * the police should fine you if you throw trash on the ground . 
  * we do n't have a good recycling system , most do n't recycle at all . 
  feel free to add some more . . 
  he said it on three different occasions !, 
   but i guess he 's staying for money , power and to avoid jail the sake of romanian citizens . 
  just because he 's afraid of admitting that he 's a dirty liar , money laundering piece of shit . 
  he reminds me of that child in class which teachers love and wo n't ever punish when he does inappropriate things . 
  but not for long , i see some protests coming . 
  too bad that / r/europe dose n't have a black colored jail flair to catch the reader 's eye , like we have on / r/romania . 
  well , yeah , lol . . 
  aw yiss !, 
  heh , not quite . 
  but you should visit and see for yourself !, 
   thank you romania for providing the best integrated immigrants . 
  romania stronk !, 
  haha , i think it 's unlikely , those are just ordinary people at the opening . 
  the hotel is pretty close to our main [ attraction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l9e5gguncu ) so it will be full of tourists . 
  yes , dacians and romans . 
  wow , til !, 
  [ this is how it 's done : ( alba iulia , romania ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjgkebplzse ), 
  wolves , bears , wild boars , the usual stuff . . 
  thanks for taking an interest in it !, 
  yes i do . 
  being so much as stake , the prosecutors make sure that they have a rocksolid case before they get in front of a judge with it . 
  in my oinion the judges are competent too , although the punishments could be more harsh . 
  also , some corrupt judges have been jailed so i do n't think anyone is taking any risks right now . 
  as days go by his criminal case file only gets thicker as the investigation goes further , i 'll say we 're goning to see even more seizure of property or even jail time . 
  not so long ago he also sold two apartments , exchanged one with his father in law ( who 's also a member of the social democratic party ) , he donated a summer house , gave his citroen , and decrared that he owns 1/2 of a house which belonged to his wife until then . 
  i think that something is not right here , and i believe the prosecurors think the same . 
  * two new prisons are being built * the prosecutors [ seized our pm 's aprtment . 
  ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/prosecutors-seize-romanian-prime-ministers-apartment/154092/ ), 
  yes !, 
  this !, 
  also daredevil . . 
  i 've seen solaris ( it was great ) but i have n't seen stalker yet . 
  i 'm glad to hear that !,

  op was just trying to scare you or something . 
  do n't worry , most trains are n't like those and i 've never seen a dirty bus . 
   also , do i have to bring a knife , or mma will be enough ? 
  gun maybe ? 
  no you do n't . 
  in 23 years , i never felt usafe in my country . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/wiki/travel ) is our travel guide , have a great day !, 
  yeah , but it 's still russia ... 
  shh , he 's bad with colors . . 
  yeah , the only one that i could find around here . 
  it sells only at lidl during the `` american week '' . 
  shame they do n't have a `` canadian week '' . 
  that 's such a nice gesture !, 
  i 've only had [ this one ] ( http://city.sigmalive.com/sites/default/files/106210.jpg ) , i 'm wondering if it 's the real deal . 
  deer and hog , apparently . . 
  since they legally owned the weapons , it 's unlikely . . 
   from information gathered by prosecutors until now it seems that the guns and rifles presented were for hunting and also were legally owned . 
  i like your way of thinking !, 
  only 14 % would want romania to exit the eu , and 6 % would n't vote at all . 
  i see your point , but despite bad investments and corruption our country is still evolving with the help of many eu measures and funds .

  savage !, 
  generation z rarely votes from what we saw recently . 
  what you do think that we can do to fix that ? 
  haha !, 
  romanian is a romance language so it 's very similar . 
  do not click on ireland !!!!!!!, 
  it is , over 50.000 in bucharest , 10.000 in cluj , 8.000 in timisoara , 5.000 in sibiu , 3.000 in iasi and 200 in alba iulia ( my city ),
