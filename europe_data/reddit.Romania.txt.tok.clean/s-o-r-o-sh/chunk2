  yes we need an accountability mechanism , and since it 'd be a trans-national force , this should be trans-national accountability ( accountable to both ec and ep ? ) . 
  that 's yet another difference from your colonial police ... this would not be a police that is accountable to germany and polices greece , it 'd be a police accountable to both greece & germany , that polices both greece & germany . 
  nothing colonial about it . 
   ah , so you did n't mean `` wisely '' . 
  it was meant to be an euphemism , do n't take everything so literally . 
   then we have the same issue with eu police and prosecutors too . 
  who keeps them in check ? 
  it 's almost like you 're being intentionally obtuse about how corruption works . 
  i started writing an answer , but it 's long , so let me flip it : what exactly are your concerns ? 
  that it would be useless ? 
  or that it would be oppressive ? 
  or something else ? 
  ( and i bit of hints of why you think that 's a significant risk , would help )  was n't the key finding by the ecj that he could n't force judges to retire at 62 instead of 70 for that particular issue ( which is only one of them ) it was more like `` you ca n't do this suddenly , you have no reason to , if you want to reduce the retirement age you have to do it gradually '' . 
  but , stop for a second and wonder why did orban issue that reform ? 
  was he concerned about judges working too hard , for too long ? 
  the way things work in practice ... he was probably concerned about one particular judge , over 62 years of age , that was close to issuing one particular judgement . 
  eu may have `` won the case '' , but it was probably a pyrrhic victory . 
  of course i was n't suggesting lack of due process . 
  in fact , a stronger injunction process that you propose might work . 
  personally , i 'd just like a form of personal liability in extreme cases , so that politicians who are brazen in their corrupt ways ( like our very own dragnea ) have one additional thing to worry about . 
  there is no good reason that i can see , ** ever ** , for o politician to push controversial legislation on fast-forward ( there are a lot of bad reasons why this happens in practice ) . 
  i 'd want a way to impose personal liability on people who do that , when it turns out ( at the end of their due process ) that indeed said legislation was at odds with eu law . 
   well that 's a pretty patronising statement . 
  who defines `` wisdom '' in this context ? 
  no it 's not . 
  by `` wisely '' i meant `` for the original purpose , not for enrichment of local officials '' . 
  which happens a lot more often that we care to admit . 
  and the control mechanisms are currently pretty weak , all the eu can currently do is say `` we wo n't fund country x anymore '' ( and only for blatant corruption ) - it 'd be so much better for everyone involved if they could directly contribute towards jailing people for misusing eu funds . 
   unless those elected officials are implementing legislation which breaks the eu law . 
  which is what i 'm talking about . 
  we do have mechanisms to deal with that , i just feel that they might be ... ahem ... improved . 
  you know , so that it does n't take * on average * about 2 years * after the infringement ruling * for the case to be closed by the infringing nation . 
  i 'd like decisions that break basic eu rules to be overturnable immediately ( as in e.g. 
  orban 's `` judiciary reforms '' ) , and maybe for serious offenses we could have consequences for the individuals in question , not just the country ( e.g. 
  : temporary interdiction to run for a public office or hold a public office position , for key political figures that decide to promote legislation clearly against basic eu rules & principles , despite warnings ), 
  i thought uk were the ones who fail apart by may ^ ^ * ^ \\ ( * \\ ) ^ after ^ cameron ^ refused ^ the ^ job, 
   i 'm not seeing the massive need . 
  use of eu money is highly politicized and rich countries are always skeptical that poor countries are wisely using their money . 
  such federal law enforcement would go a long way towards ( a ) alleviating those worries , and ( b ) objectively reducing fraud on eu funds . 
  and once we have them , maybe we can have them somehow enforce the eu acquis , so that you do n't get people like orban , or dragnea , who take majority votes in a country and start to do shit with impunity , not fearing anybody . 
  i agree though that 's a more delicate subject . 
   it just seems too cold war for me . 
  the great thing about cold war was that it was cold . 
  i prefer much more a cold one to a hot one , if we are to have one . 
  ( i 'm not really concerned that we 'll start invading countries , it 's not an eu thing - those would be used defensively + as a deterrent ), 
  yeah , but not because of the bull . 
   they also have their flags and bald eagles uniting them hey !, 
  we have a flag too , and while we may not have a bald eagle - we have [ the bull ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/european_union_residence_permit_emblem.svg/500px-european_union_residence_permit_emblem.svg.png ) , that could work , right ? 
  not estonia , but i for one would welcome : - a strong , well-funded eu federal police , attorneys & trans-national courts , which would be habilitated to investigate e.g. 
  fraud on eu funds , trans-national crime , maybe even serious violation of `` eu acquis '' ( something akin to `` treason '' if you wish ) - a federal military - including border guard . 
  i do n't think this should prevent national ones from existing , but will likely diminish their importance over time - a common foreign policy the other ones are roughly fine as they are ( including legislation - let ep decide on general directives , and leave countries implement specific legislation for said directives ) . 
  i think harmonization of fiscal policy & social security is currently a step too far to even consider . 
  it 'll eventually maybe lead to that ... but a long way in the future . 
  what kind of monster would put pineapple in kebab ? 
  ih , i do agree - hence my final comment :  in practical terms , this definition is probably good enough . 
  yes !, 
  mooods , you forgot the chicken !, 
  nobody is claiming that is a good situation to be in , but we certainly have come a long way if `` severe material deprivation '' means you may actually have decent housing & food, 
  denmark trend is slightly concerning , but the absolute figures are still low enough that one should n't read too much into it ( the cuts you mention may completely explain it ) . 
  otoh , i find italy and spain worrisome . 
  these are big countries , it 's bad when this happens to them . 
  ( greece trend is bad too , obviously , but well , greece is not going to bring down eu in case of crisis ; either one of italy or spain , just might ), 
  so , basically , not affording a washing machine , car , tv set and going on holiday would qualify ? 
  i 'm not saying this is a pleasant situation to be in ... but being able to pay for rent , food , keep home adequately warm and face an occasional unexpected expense does n't feel like '' ** severe ** material deprivation '' i do realize though that most people would give up `` eating meat regularly '' for a television set , so in practical terms , this definition is probably good enough . 
  but improving a lot , which is tremendously important . 
  do n't ignore the trends . 
   you could argue that everyone else has weird constitutions uk in a nutshell :d, 
  oh , so now i understand why finland has more metalheads than netherlands ... 
  poland : [ i am dissapoint ] ( https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/pl/va ) .

  gee , i do n't want any more babies !, 
  guess if i decide to emigrate , it wo n't be us ... 
  `` we are sorry . 
  he 's kinda dumb , sometimes '' good enough explanation ? 
  am a simple redditor . 
  i cry seeing how bad our education has fallen . 
  then i look at bulgaria , and i upvote . 
  thanks bros !, 
  yet again , we 're not the last ones in the eu !, 
  aye ... how badly we have fallen . 
  also , hungary , wtf ? 
  have all the martians left you ? 
  [ unsurprisingly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ) - no . 
  wow , first the rape statistics , now this ... crime really is getting high there ^ ( / runs for cover ), 
  you 've oriented your flag wrong , neighbour !, 
  even for 2013 , this ** must ** be wrong . 
  there 's no way in hell romania would n't have cited `` russia '' there . 
  yes , in 2013 too . 
  i go to us about twice a year on average , maybe more . 
  i do n't claim to know us well , how could i ? 
  i mostly visit places populated with ( relatively ) rich people . 
  but i do n't take all my opinions from reddit , either . 
  if your father is really that bad , i agree it may be hopeless . 
  sometimes , fathers talk tough , without also acting tough - would he really kick you out for telling him you 're a liberal ? 
  you know him best ... if he really is so , i feel bad for you :( when i have time - i 'll try as an exercise to go to the_donald , will let you know how it goes . 
  but btw , i do not consider just the republicans to be `` victims '' , i consider all of you guys to be victims of this toxic/divisive style of politics . 
  it really got exacerbated in recent years with the echo-chambers of facebook & co , to the point where it got really bad . 
  pray tell me one who achieved significant things / at the very least , grew his lottery fortune . 
  must be very easy , right ? 
  surely one of the [ remaining 30 % ] ( http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2016/01/why_do_70_percent_of_lottery_w.html ) went on to achieve fame , since my claim is so idiotic ?
