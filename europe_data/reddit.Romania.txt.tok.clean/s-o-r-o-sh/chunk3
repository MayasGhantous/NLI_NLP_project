  started a new business , or made something otherwise remarkable with said money ? 
   in fact , about 70 percent of people who win a lottery or get a big windfall actually end up broke in a few years , according to the national endowment for financial education . 
   unfazed \u028cn\u02c8fe\u026azd / adjective informal :  not disconcerted or perturbed . 
  now , i 'm definitely not a native speaker , but i meant `` unfazed '' as in `` the fact that their world view is a deeply-unrealistic one ( half of americans are mentally ill racists ) does n't disconcert them / prevent them from holding said world view '' . 
  they are troubled by the world they ( believe to ) live in , they are n't troubled by the fact that this hypothetic world is deeply unrealistic . 
  the country that elected obama is the same country that elected trump . 
  it 's not realistic to believe that it changed that much in a few years . 
   you have any suggestions on how i , as an american citizen , can heal these societal divisions ? 
  stop propagating them . 
  tell your friends that they do themselves a disservice by propagating them . 
  for too long , the strategy of both sides was one of `` division '' - of using scare-mongering to try to break-away people from the middle and take them to their side . 
  of fear that the other side is going to `` destroy us all '' and that 's why you should n't even be talking to them . 
  this is the exact same thing that hillary did too - see her `` basket of deplorables '' comment . 
  this needs to stop . 
  you need a strong middle ground . 
  it wo n't come from politicians on either side - they have little interest in that , they need a stable electoral base that wo n't move to `` the other side '' no matter what stupid things they ( the politicians ) do . 
  because the other side is always worse , right ? 
  and they already made sure that you only have two sides to pick from . 
  what can you do ? 
  by all means , stop propagating this madness . 
  i know it 's hard , and it feels wrong to reach to the conservatives , and try to view the world from their perspective , and be a little bit open to their view and concerns and problems . 
  but i believe it 's also the only way possible . 
  and it can only start from the regular people . 
  you most likely have a parent , or grandparent , or uncle who is a republican . 
  remember that he 's not a racist monster , he 's a kind person that helped you grow up & loved you - find bridges with him instead of finding reason to be irritated by him . 
  you as a citizen ca n't do much , this is true . 
  but 50 million of you , can . 
  and those 50 million will have to start with just a few , because that 's the only way it can start . 
  same thing - i meant `` unfazed '' as in `` they really consider this to be a realistic possibility '' . 
  if they are appalled , they clearly do n't question their own world view . 
   we here in the us are taking ** it ** extremely seriously it , right ? 
  see what i mean ? 
  i talked about `` taking him seriously '' ... many of the smart americans are just concerned that an idiot who is utterly unqualified for the job and acts completely random is now in charge , and are angry at the idiots who support him . 
  they are taking `` the situation '' seriously , not the man . 
  populists of his kind thrive on divisions in the society . 
  first thing to do would be to attempt to heal the deep split in the us society . 
  do n't just lament on how utterly unqualified for the job his appointees are - give them ( at least formally ) the benefit of the doubt , and push as primary rhetoric how their current actions ( not their past ! ), 
  are hurting the regular american citizen . 
  you wasted a huge protest on ... what ? 
  not even sure what you protested against , the man had barely taken office and did n't do anything yet ( yes , he issued the `` muslim ban '' order shortly after that . 
  if only you had waited a few days , to protest not on the imaginary future violations of women rights , but on actual violations of the rights of greencard-holding iranians ! ) . 
  should be a carrot-and-stick , not stick-and-no_carrot_for_you . 
  be clear that you ^ ( * ) are open to cooperate on issues that benefit the general public , but you will staunchly oppose when he does things that violate the liberal values ( keyword : does . 
  because talk is cheap , and he talks a lot of crap , if you react to words he 'll just consume all your energy ) . 
  there is still the hope that the intelligence community will take him down . 
  it would be an somewhat-acceptable outcome , that at least avoids the worst-case-scenario ... but , it would set a rather unfortunate precedent ; and not just for you , but for democracies everywhere , because whether we want it or not , us is still a global model . 
  ^ * this applies mostly to public democrat figures , not to the ordinary citizen . 
  but speaks about an attitude that i found to be completely lacking . 
   i do n't understand why this even matters . 
  i sort-of explained [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5uk6p8/the_rise_of_trump_has_led_to_an_unexpected_twist/dduv5mf/ ) . 
  i 'm scared that the dude may literally cause huge disasters of the `` world-ending '' kind , and the people who could stop him wo n't because they 're busy chasing irrelevant illusions of racism and incompetence . 
  until they start taking him seriously , they wo n't be able to mount a serious opposition to trump , he 'll just play them anyway he wants to . 
  i hope that i 'm wrong , and that he 's really just a crazy , lucky , incompetent fool . 
  i really hope so . 
  [ update ] read [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/hitlers-world-may-not-be-so-far-away ) to understand my fears , in the context where i really do believe trump will do everything possible to move production from china to the us . 
  also consider his stance on all-things-related-to-ecology-and-global-warming . 
  fortune has a rather detailed analysis that pegs him at about 3.7 b , if i remember correctly, 
  well , narcissism aside ( which i wo n't dispute  ) , i think the fundamental premise where we disagree is whether trump feels like he has congress / supreme court on his side . 
  i think he considers them `` probably hostile '' and acts as such . 
  he 's not your traditional candidate that cares about the party - he only cares about the `` trump '' brand , and could n't care less about the `` republican '' brand . 
  the `` method behind madness '' needs to be viewed from this perspective - how do you push your agenda if you have no real allies , if you got there * despite * the parties , not supported by them ? 
  and `` the agenda '' ** is ** the trump brand . 
  does n't matter whether it 's rightfully or artificially inflated , as long as it is inflated . 
  i believe that his primary driver for his actions as president will be to `` increase the trump brand '' . 
  if he can do that by artificially creating the feeling that `` he 's very effective '' while doing nothing at all , i 'm reasonably sure that 's the path that he 'll take , as it has the least amount of risk . 
  as long as the `` effective '' feeling persists . 
   if you know of a nicer explanation of the behavior of trump supporters i 'd gladly hear it . 
  i 've seen it before . 
  it 's typically desperation , wanting to `` rock the boat '' - taking the radical approach because `` we need to do something '' . 
  indeed , this often leads to poor choices , but trump does `` rock the boat '' , which is the primary reason why he got elected in the first place . 
  he * is * `` draining the swamp '' - his supporters elected him to make the establishment nervous , and he 's doing just that . 
  the two-party political system in the us kinda ' sucks , and it 's not hard to get the feeling that nobody listens to / cares about your issues , and that you have no voice . 
  so let me take the role of devil 's advocate about `` turning a blind eye to cabinet appointees '' : why do you say that ? 
  remember that most damning information , you 've got via liberal-friendly press . 
  which is by definition not trustworthy , because it 's partisan . 
  are the cabinet choices really bad , or is the press just painting them this way ? 
  hard to know , objectively ... makes sense to wait and see the actual actions they take . 
  here 's the thing about cognitive dissonance : it does n't affect just the stupid . 
  and you ca n't see it , if you 're affected by it . 
  all the press that painted trump as `` literally hitler '' , wants to prove they were right . 
  because , sure as hell they would look stupid if trump was nothing like hitler . 
  we 're good at cherry-picking the evidence that supports our views , and discarding the one that does n't , 
  for lottery winners - i have n't heard of a single one of them doing something remarkable , and there are well-known ( i thought ) statistics that [ a large majority ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/tragic-stories-lottery-winners-article-1.2492941 ) of them end up broke within a few years . 
  for people who inherit wealth - the alternative to the claim that many manage it well would be `` few manage it well '' , which would only help my point . 
  so i see no need to substantiate that claim , given that it does n't help my point . 
  ( if few people who inherit wealth manage it well , it only makes it more remarkable that trump did it , right ? ), 
  what facts do you want ? 
  here : http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vs-other-billionaires-2015-8 read it either as `` he sucks '' or `` he 's better than bill koch '' . 
  your choice . 
  but be aware that 99.999 % of america is not on that list . 
  but that 's what pisses me off . 
  that 's how you get trump - by labeling those that disagree with you as `` mentally ill '' , `` racists '' , `` crazy '' etc. 
  because , how can they disagree when you 're * obviously * right ? 
  what 's the point to engage in meaningful dialogue with the mentally ill ? 
  the liberals seem to be completely unfazed by the prospect that , according to their ( hyperbolic or not ) world view , half of americans are mentally ill racists . 
  i find this deeply troubling . 
  yes it is . 
  which is why there 's probably not a single lottery winner who managed to do something with the newly-found fortune . 
  yes , many ( not all , maybe not even the majority ! ), 
  people who inherit fortunes manage them well , but that 's not because it 's easy & effortless , it 's also because they really are fairly smart , well-educated people ( since you know , their parents had the means to provide them with a decent education ) .
