  why ca n't we just get rid of physical money instead ? 
  i swear it 's a no brainer , do n't know why no politician proposed this already . 
  [ does this qualify ] ( http://userimages01-akm.imvu.com/productdata/stickers_19d4235f3a4a7623878e590b81c619bd.gif ) ? 
  the right to be a flotus ? 
   politically not viable to even propose a ban on alcohol due to the fact that was already tried with devastating consequences well , posters [ like this one ] ( http://sfbaytimeless.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/holy-sisters-of-prune-face-frustration.jpg ) are nearly certain to turn you into an alcoholic , regardless of the associated risks . 
   despite the thumbnail picture , finland is n't actually going to eradicate smokers by killing them all . 
  i think you 're trying to mislead us . 
  forget the picture - how else can you explain the title itself ? 
  it 's not that finland will eradicate smoking - they clearly set sights on the smokers themselves . 
  he 's a really nice and decent guy . 
  also major philanthropist . 
  i can confirm that he does , in fact , sleep . 
  his influence is seriously over-hyped . 
  or are just collecting insurance . 
  this one club that burns suspiciously often . 
  ( no serious injury among the 38 people , afaik ), 
  poor moldova , not even considered `` country '' enough for this map, 
  i blame the lithuanians for that . 
  have yet to meet a single noble pole , they are all plumbers . 
  ok , ok . we can keep the lithuanians out if you insist . 
  definitely get a dog , [ it 's very good at trolling the cats ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7tknrdlxp7oqgsng/giphy.gif ) .

  what do you mean ? 
  the orkney flag has lemon-yellow , whereas ours has ( of course ) honey-yellow . 
  totally different . 
  are you colourblind or something ? 
  can you reclaim us , too ? 
  unlike eesti , we have always been nordic people ... 
  i see that / u/zefo _ dias speaks portuguese - so he 's probably brazilian . 
  as recent events show , russia ca n't even take `` novorossyia '' , when pitted against a ukrainian army that was at the time vastly inferior ( in training & equipment ) to the polish one . 
  i do n't doubt that russia could overrun the baltic states , due to the sheer numeric superiority ; but they probably ca n't overrun either poland or ukraine as things are standing now . 
  that 's because there are not just theoretical `` numbers '' considerations here - you have to consider the willingness of the russian population to actually sustain such a conflict that would no doubt inflict a massive damage to the russian army ( read : russian youth ) . 
  how is putin going to justify that ? 
  rt has its limits you know ... empty propaganda only works until your loved ones start dying . 
  after that you quickly start questioning it . 
  `` how many divisions does the pope of rome have ? '', 
  it 's a flawed statistic . 
  it does n't include honey from the rightful hungarian clay in transylvania . 
  hey !, 
  wan na move over here ? 
  do n't think we do n't know who you are , \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0439 !, 
  there are 2 kinds of poles : those who are there to understand your perspective , and those who are there to change it . 
  it 's all just a big social experiment . 
  the poles at home are staying to write the research paper . 
  eh , was n't really worried , just curious what 's up with the stereotype , 
  disclaimer : not trying to preach / i 'm not a native speaker either  - i write this hoping that a native english speaker might confirm/deny/fill in nuances . 
  my understanding of english is that these sort of expressions are not to be taken literally . 
  sort of like `` i have no < adjective  bone in my body '' - nobody is expecting your bones to be artistic , it just means that you 're not good at arts . 
  same with something `` running deep through the genes '' - it means it 's an old tradition , not that it 's a genetical thingy . 
  wait , i do n't like this stereotype about my next summer vacation . 
  weed i do n't mind , but what 's up with the terrorists ? 
  in all honesty , there was talk of a [ rebel airforce ] ( https://conflictreport.info/2015/01/18/six-questions-answered-about-the-russian-invasion-armys-air-force/ ) that never materialised . 
  i guess ukrainian air defences are too good for russia to risk it . 
  i see erdogan is not good with complex numbers . 
  because the first terrorist is real , while the second is imaginary . 
  anybody could buy those from a corner shop , and besides ukraine has them too , glorious rebels just stole them from the nazi junta . 
  also , tractor drivers can be repurposed for tank drivers ( on rt , at least ) ... but even the russian public might find it hard to believe that tractor drivers were flying mig-29ks, 
  heck , i might be completely misinformed , but i feel just spending some time on / r/europe informed me a bit about some of the differences between european cultures . 
  it 's not a perfect image , but the larger point is that i think an official that wants to be informed about , say , french ethos , can get most of the relevant information easily , without speaking the language . 
  what is true is that most people do n't do that . 
  even if you could inform all government employees about , say , `` russian culture and ethos '' - most would simply not be interested , and it 'd take a major administrative/managerial effort to get that information into the administration . 
  whereas if most of them speak russian - you get that for free . 
  which brings about the second point : it may be a weakness now , for americans . 
  maybe . 
  but if they realise it and setup the mechanism to inform employees about foreign ethos/culture ... they 'll have that mechanism reusable in the future . 
  you can have most employees be bilingual ( e.g. 
  chinese speaking english ) - but it 's kinda ' hard to have them all know arabic , farsi , russian , chinese , french , german , spanish , ~ ~ brasilian ~ ~ portuguese etc. 
  til austria looks like a dick ( rotated 180 \u00b0 ), 
  jaden smith is a fake person, 
  well , it does have potatoes , right ? 
  lithuania would approve . 
  not empty . 
  it was full of snow :p, 
  you could also update the law so that you no longer naturalise vegans , unless they can prove they 're not annoying . 
  that 'd work , right ? 
  last time they did this with mexico . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/55bg0t/why_is_mexico_in_the_reurope_interactive_map/ ), 
  ok , how do i get this guy to put the money where his mouth is ? 
  i 'm willing to bet any amount ( 1/1 rate ) that it wo n't be lepen . 
   a dutch vegan was also turned down for swiss passport for being `` annoying . '', 
  i do n't know about you , but to me this seems both plausible & legitimate reason :p, 
  i think i 've seen this before , it 's quite popular in [ some kind of countries ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/l/v/k/3/t/image.related.articleleadwide.620x349.glvk2i.png/1461652386252.jpg ) ... 
  it really was unfunny . 
  if you wanted to make it funny you should 've at least attempted to simulate an explain-bot , something like this :   of portuguese variety . 
   this text is funny because of the meme that says portuguese women are hairy .

  no , you got it wrong . 
  it 's not `` baltic '' who can encompass all of these - it 's `` russia '', 
  i 'm confused . 
  your username does n't seem to match the flag ... 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  do n't you like [ cake ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c1/21/37/c12137ff1d02bbf582f5412813d625da.jpg ) ?

  and [ bulgaria ] ( http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/2740/natures_flag.jpg ) . 
  because they can not into nordic . 
  and estonia, 
  what do you mean , that is pure propaganda , are you a gay nazi ? 
  what about all the people that hitler killed ? 
  why do you hate jews ? 
  great russia sacrificed itself to save the world from fascism , and this is the gratitude that we get ??
