  you forgot to say that america used napalm during vietnam . 
  on peace-loving civilians that were only defending their country from american imperialism . 
  heck , i think that referendum would be a landslide in bucharest , too !, 
  whoa , what 's with all that passive-aggressiveness towards the agender , genderfluid and genderqueer ? 
  eh - somebody needs to talk some sense into those kids too , right ? 
  talk about shitty fireworks ... 
  let me just identify [ the `` back '' ] ( http://www.explozivnews24.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/situatie-voturi-teleorman-bec.jpg ) for you , so that we do n't have any unfortunate accidents . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  whew , 30-39 , a notch above africa . 
  i wonder why we 're below moldova though . 
  probably it has something to do with our obsession for c-sections . 
  his problem got removed . 
  what was it ? 
  romanian not liking stuff , because romania sucks by default ? 
  whew , the baltics are not included yet . 
  well , setting aside that / u/arschhaar already debunked your links on china , us , uk ... do you have something like this about germany ? 
  france ? 
  spain ? 
  italy ? 
  australia ? 
  japan ? 
  india ? 
  brazil ? 
  yeah i see 5 european languages there but where 's the sixth ? 
  we have : * japanse , hindi , mandarin : asian languages * arrabic : middle-east language * portuguese : south-american language . 
  came here to say this . 
  in [ 70s and 80s things were much worse ] ( https://assets.weforum.org/editor/kdr6tocqjixqwjpjabo-yofc56u3rmobpmes4fmtdfw.jpg ) , and then it all settled down . 
  i do n't fear that this will be permanent - very few things are . 
  well , authoritarian & far right , yes . 
  but calling putin a nazi sympathiser is a bit of a stretch . 
  in front of their names . 
  that may very well be . 
  but if we 're resorting to animal analogies , i can play the exact same game to `` prove '' the opposite point . 
  i was n't trying to say `` gun ban laws are good '' ^ ( * ) , as much as i was trying to say `` this whole wolf metaphor is meaningless and can be easily done both ways '' . 
  ( * ) in particular , i think the evidence supports the idea reasonably strict gun ownership rules are beneficial . 
  yes , widespread gun ownership can work in some very special conditions ( `` switzerland '' ) , but even in a fairly advanced society like the us one it can fail miserably . 
  however , i think it 's none of eu 's business , it works well so far ( in europe ) to let the national governments decide , i do n't see why we 'd change that . 
  uk does n't speak english ? 
  otoh , jackals love it . 
  if enough sheep have guns , they 'll have plenty of dead corpses to feed on . 
  all but the targeted one , of course . 
  it 's okay , if you are dumb we 'll still make you a mp . 
  well , have you ( and / u/telperion87 ) seen the flags ? 
  ( that was my attempt at a joke ; those flags get used in lots of websites where you can select the language ; and brits + portuguese always seem to be offended by the flag choice ) . 
  parody of course , but more accurate than you 'd think . 
  liviu dragnea is sevil shhaideh 's godfather , and she already has a bit of history for `` filling in '' for him . 
  you should n't be . 
  here 's her picture , [ waiting to be nominated ] ( http://www.timesnewroman.ro/monden/poza-zilei-sevil-shhaideh-s-a-prezentat-la-cotroceni-si-asteapta-sa-fie-investita-de-iohannis ) ( parody of course , but more accurate than you 'd think ), 
   mona is a medicinal alcohol that peoples drinks it with water . 
  i thought in vaslui they drink it without water ( but they filter it through bread so that it 's no longer blue ... they do n't drink it `` as is '' like that barbarian ), 
  eh , come on . 
  even in crimea he won : `` gained clay '' . 
  was it worth it ? 
  probably not , fits perfectly the `` won battle , lost war '' pattern . 
  other `` gains '' that may or may not bring him anything of value : - his preferred candidate got to the white house - his ally still rules syria ( or at least part of it ), 
  i agree with the sentiment . 
  and initially , my feeling was , `` well , sucks for her , but of course she 'd be condemned '' . 
  after all , it makes sense : you want to discourage people from fighting for an `` irregular '' army , even when those irregulars happen to be on your side . 
  she should 've joined the proper danish army . 
  that said ... you lost me here :  returning isis fighters have benefited from the so-called aarhus model of reintegration and deradicalisation instead of custodial sentences . 
  this ca n't be right . 
  i get the spirit , and it might even be the right way to do it ... but then , why not apply the same aarhus model to her ? 
  why does she get prison sentence if others get mentors & psychological counselling ? 
  * populism : check * grassroots movement : check * `` anti-imperialist '' - is that a thing ? 
  which empire is m5s fighting ? 
  * internal democracy : who has it , in your opinion ? 
  m5s , or usr ? 
  * gay rights : their official position is that `` they do n't have a position on it '' ( i.e. 
  various members have various opinions , they treat it as an issue of secondary importance ) . 
  if you want to say they are different , i agree . 
  however , they share more than you 'd like to admit ; most importantly , and the defining characteristic , they define themselves as anti-establishment `` un-parties '' ( collection of `` personalities '' who want to change politics , not at all a collection of ideologically-like-minded politicians ; they openly reject the left-right positioning and have people with many ideological orientations among their ranks ), 
  i mean , the labels are completely misleading in romania ... there 's very little ideology left . 
  but if i were to classify them , i 'd say : 1 . 
  psd , the so-called `` socialist '' : authoritarian , conservative , very populist , centrist 2 . 
  pnl , so called `` liberal '' : slightly-liberal , center-right , somewhat-populist 3 . 
  usr , ( new party ) : romania 's version of `` movimiento cinque stelle '' - sans the euroskepticism . 
  all over the spectrum , from pretty-hard-left to very conservative & pretty-hard-right . 
  including a few odball euroskeptics , but largely enthusiastically pro-eu . 
  on average ... 
  i 'd say , most-liberal , centrist party, 
  svetonius does n't seem to support your conclusions on caligula . 
  genuinely interested - do you have sources behind the claims that he might 've been a decent , but denigrated emperor ? 
  or if it 's in svetonius - can you link me to the relevant paragraph ( s ) ? 
  i missed it . 
  thanks for writing this !, 
  their, 
  always wondered why my nieces acted surprised so late . 
  no , you do not understand , management errors are guaranteed to occur , thus buying insurance would not be an error and as such the initial payment can not be reimbursed . 
  true , dat . ^ ( sipping a glass of brennevin ), 
   it has nothing to do with nishta . 
  you meant to say , `` it has nuffin to do with nishta '', 
  do all the mexicans hate slavery , or just mine ? 
  what have you done , now they 're far-left !, 
  religion classes are indeed ubiquitous , but are not mandatory . 
  excellent comment man , i do n't know why it was so down voted ... 
  i asked all my bots to upvote , i ` do n't even give you gold if i were n't so stingy . 
  are finnish saunas huge , or is it more acceptable to stay close to a stranger naked ( in sauna ) than fully dressed ( in the bus station ) ? 
  so did johnson and farage, 
  you are clearly unaware of the swiss prices . 
  they look at germany as `` cheap , qualified labour '' .
