  you may have not heard yet , but s\u0103laj county ceased to exist 48 hours ago . 
  taking advantage of the hectic international situation and lack of attention by the un security council , the neighboring cluj county has silently anschlussed it . 
  as shock troops , they used workers from the waste collection services , who annihilated defense by olfactory attack . 
  after that , they promptly organized a referendum , which they announced through a notification posted on the bulletin board in the lobby of the cluj town hall . 
  they interpreted the lack of participation as silent and joyous consent . 
  for tonight , the local cluj authorities have programmed a large celebration rally in the main city square , at which presence will be mandatory for all city and county employees .

  here 's a bonus one : little janos ^ 1 is playing with his toy slingshot near a romanian church . 
  the priest sees him and says : `` if you do not behave , i 'll baptise you ion ^ 2 and make you romanian . '', 
  the next day little janos is again near the church . 
  the priest sees him and keeps his promise . 
  when he gets home , little janos tells his father : `` my name is ion and i am romanian . '', 
  the father pulls out his belt and gives the boy a correction . 
  janos goes then to his mother and says : `` my name is ion and i am romanian . '', 
  the mother slaps him twice and sends him to his room . 
  finally alone , little janos thinks : `` i 've been romanian for less than 10 minutes , and these dirty hungarians are already oppressing me ! '',

  the first hun horde reaches dacia . 
  the dacians are out and about labouring their fields . 
  `` could you tell us which way is the pannonian plain , please ? '', 
  `` sure , you take the first to the right , then the third to the left etc. . . '' the horde leaves . 
  the next day , a second hun horde arrives . 
  the dacians again give them directions . 
  the third day same thing happens . 
  the dacians , now tired of being interrupted from their work , put up a sign with written directions to the pannonian plain . 
  ... and so it came to pass that those who could read settled in pannonia , but those who could n't remained in dacia .

  `` very well , thank you .

  `` no , thank you . 
  it does n't really matter . '', 
  a little while later , the hungarian says again : '' ... and when we came here 1000 years ago , that same night the romanians stole our horses . '', 
  `` very well , thank you . 
  do you want it written down ? '', 
  `` no , no . 
  it 's no big deal . '', 
  a few moments pass and the hungarian repeats : '' ... 
  but when we came here 1000 years ago , that very night the romanians stole our horses . '', 
  `` very well , thank you . 
  so do you want it written down ? '', 
  `` no , thank you .

  the romanian , by now very angry , shouts : `` it 's not true , we were n't even there ! '',

  libertarianism , shmanarchism . 
  edit : it 's strange to see the ideological ouroboros swallowing its own tail : before wwii , both the extreme left ( bolshevism ) and extreme right ( fascism ) came , though very different reasonings , to the same conclusion : the state means everything , personal freedom means nothing . 
  today , anarchists and libertarians have again a common opinion , but their present position is the polar opposite of the former one : the state means nothing , personal freedom means everything .

   privatization of the freight railroad company : the imf demanded that this company to be privatized by the end of the month , so the government had no choice but rush it . 
  best strategy if you 've just botched your job as cabinet member of a cash-strapped country : blame the imf . 
  nobody likes them anyway . 
  the truth is the government , together with the imf , established the deadline of june 20th 2013 for this privatization ** since the autumn of 2012 ** . 
  so excuse me if all this talk of `` we were forced to rush things '' does n't really sound sincere to me .
