  on the other hand , relu fenechiu , the present transport minister and the moral author of this mess , is not exactly spring chicken at bungling things ( or stealing from the state , depending on who you 're asking ) : he stands accused ( by no other than the national anticorruption directorate ) of selling between 2002-2004 , through businesses he controlled , electrical transformers in an advanced state of deterioration to a state-owned company at prices for brand-new ones , and gaining in the process the jolly little sum of $ 2,800,000 .

  well , you have a funny way of doing it . 
   [ racism is n't just a literal `` the negro race is stupid '' or `` slavs are literally inferior '' . 
  it can express itself more subtly , and `` culture criticism '' is often only thinly veiled racism because nationstates combine culture with sovereignty .

  funny thing is that when the austrians from omv came to romania , it was the romanians [ who had to check for their wallets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrom#privatization_controversy ) . 
   what we really need is another wave of not-a-gypsy posts by romanians , i am really missing those . 
  oh , man , not another one of those poe 's law comments . 
  i can almost hear the * woosh * passing over my head . 
  you truly have a way with words , i 'll give you that . 
  but you are also rambling . 
  let me explain why :  `` the facts '' , `` the narrative '' , `` the strawman '' and `` the ad hominem '' the fact is that irl , romania has given up a long time ago on seeing a single cent from those 120 tons of treasure . 
  but returning at least the ancient manuscripts and the archives of the romanian academy would be a nice gesture of of goodwill . 
  the fact is that , in the very much narrower scope of this thread , when i argumented ( successfully , imho ) against your * narrative * that is romania who still owes something to russia , you chose to dodge that completely , and bring forth the even more pernicious * narrative * that romania is the duplicituous party here , and -- i suppose -- that means that grand and oh-so-to-the-straight-and-narrow russia is absolved of any historical obligations . 
  the fact is that talking about * russian bessarabia * in 2015 , is just about as delusional as talking about british india or dutch indonesia . 
  if you 're looking for a * strawman * , you have one right there . 
  the fact is that it was 4:15 am when i wrote that , on the second page of a reddit thread , dialoguing with someone who keeps changing his * narrative * , ignores lost arguments , and responds with irony and thinly-veiled insults . 
  so , please , do not be so mightily offended that i chose in return to respond with * sarcasm * . 
  an important difference from * ad hominem * . 
  so , live long and prosper . 
  just a final suggestion : perhaps russia should change its national motto to `` nunquam satis '' ( it 's never enough ) . 
  it 's so much more appropriate . 
  so , not only are you saying that russia has no obligations toward romania regarding the treasure , but , in true 19th-century colonial fashion , you claim that russia is the legitimate ruler of the moldavian people !, 
  you truly are a son of mother russia !, 
   russian bessarabia so , 107 years of colonial occupation of an ethnically-foreign territory means an eternal right to that territory ? 
  obviously , you refuse to recognize the right to self-determination . 
  ( you also accept that crimea is ukrainian , i suppose . ), 
   forced local elites to accept a union the union was decided by * sfatul \u021a\u0103rii * , the national council , the democratically-elected parliament of bessarabia . 
  but , obviously , you do not recognize popular representation either . 
   it only took a year for romania to switch sides in march 1918 , russia signed a separate peace with the central powers , ceasing to be a part of the entente , and renouncing by its own accord to all claims to the territories of finland , the baltic states , belarus , and ukraine . 
  that was six months before bessarabia 's national council decided the union with romania . 
  but , obviously , you do not recognize signed treaties either . 
   ` you ' were also among the criminals who sacked his home actually , i 'm glad that you brought that up . 
  yes , romania fought in wwii against russia , and some of the things it did were shameful and beyond what is considered acceptable even during a war . 
  the thing is though , after 1944 romania settled in full that debt , both in blood and in money : * after august 1944 , it fought beside the soviets and against the germans until the war 's end , at the level of 538,000 troops , and incurring 167,000 casualties ; there still are romanian military cemeteries in slovakia today , * it paid 300 million usd in war reparations to russia , as required under the paris peace treaty , * it was under soviet military occupation until 1958 , and the political underling of the soviet union until 1991 , * it was drained of natural resources in the most shamelessly colonial manner , through the so-called sovroms , up until 1958 , * more than 100,000 people were deported to the gulag from bessarabia , and more 20,000 from romania proper . 
   the first to backstab him that is just ridiculously and patently false . 
  during the whole of the 1930s , romania 's nicolae titulescu attempted to sign a peace treaty with the soviets , and was a close friend to maxim litvinov . 
  then in 1939 , soviet russia went and signed the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact with nazi germany . 
  under its secret provisions , it gave in 1940 an ultimatum to romania to evacuate bessarabia and northern bukovina , both majority romanian at the time , or face war . 
  backstabbing ? 
  yes . 
  by russia . 
   the soviets refused to call themselves the successor state of the russian empire . 
  they may very well refused , but that did n't change the rules under which international relations work . 
  and , very conveniently , that refusal did n't include russia 's `` rights '' to its former imperial territories . 
  plus , we 're not talking about soviet russia , we 're talking about today 's russia , pravoslavnik russia , russia which flies the flag with the double-headed eagle of the czars . 
   so , there 's that guy you 're buddies with that 's a poor and misleading analogy . 
  we 're not talking about individuals , we 're talking about national entities , organized political communities of tens of millions of individuals , with obligations , duties and rights supposed to transcend the individual , and lasting long beyond the span of a lifetime . 
   and then you go to his distant relative , today 's russia is not the `` distant relative '' but the direct successor of the soviet union and of the czarist empire , proclaimed as such by itself , and recognized as such by the whole global community . 
   what makes you think that it was n't simply the only part that had survived ? 
  if it is , it would be inconsequential . 
  the obligation still remains . 
  but we do n't really know that , because the mere dialogue about this matter is refused by russia . 
  btw , the return of the pietroasele hoard not only constitutes an admission that parts , if not all , of the treasure still exist , but also constitutes an admission that russia 's obligation to romania is still standing . 
  the matter of the romania 's national treasure has nothing to do with german occupation , nazi or civil war pillagers , but dates back to 1917 , when romania sent it for safekeeping to its wartime ally , russia . 
  not as a loan , not as a gift , not as spoils of war , but for safekeeping . 
  as for the question if it still exists , in 1956 khruschev sent a small part of it back -- the pietroasele hoard -- , as a personal favor to his drinking buddy gheorghe gheorghiu-dej . 
  actually , i agree . 
  i kind of like the french integration model . 
  it 's not the camembert , it 's the kebab . 
  yeah , well , when the joke 's about actual russian troops , it is indeed kinda fizzled out . 
  but here it 's about frozen accounts , so i 'd say about 8/10 on the crack-o-meter . 
  yeah , well , that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
  well , it 's either that , or your butthurt detector must be seriously out of whack . 
  huh . 
  still sore about that world cup match in 1994 , i see . 
   they also lost majority-hungarian regions directly adjacent to their borders was it unjust to the local population of those border strips ? 
  yes . 
  was it unjustified ? 
  the decision to give a protective buffer zone to czechoslovakia and romania was a consequence of the [ military action taken in 1919 by the post-war hungarian leadership against the slovakian and romanian communities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9la_kun#the_soviet_republic.2c_1919 ) , both of which had declared their [ right to self-determination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) . 
  and that 's exactly what the interviewee is saying . 
  so , you 're saying that putin has the status of divinity , the same as the emperor of japan . 
  good to know . 
   i mean the explosives are probably worth more  / s that 's awfully nice , / u/poefi . 
  and that **  / s ** really makes the nasty , poisonous thing you 've just said look all harmless and funny . 
   it 's romania 's fault - they want to steal our glory ... or something  naaah , mate . 
  on this one , the onus is clearly on you .

  it 's funny how you talk about `` contriving a narrative '' while in the same breath you predict the demise of a continent because you met a person on an online forum with an opinion different than yours . 
  i do n't know if the alt-right has a little red book , prescribing what 's right and what 's wrong . 
  or perhaps it 's just op not doing his agitprop job that well . 
  i do n't think posting this article is unrelated . 
  it could be perfectly fitted in a logic of `` white man 's burden '' . 
  also , the fact op posted it in multiple subs simultaneously , as he does with his regular alt-right postings points to the same conclusion : in his view , it 's part of the same propaganda campaign . 
  did i say that ? 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i think the same can be said about the ideology promoted by op . 
  holly mackerel , op , your posting history gave me herpes . 
  < sigh  nevermind ... 
  as i said elsewhere , i 'm not offended by your comment . 
  it was clever and i 've read much worse . 
  i 'm just intrigued by your complete lack of introspection . 
  but , hey , to each his own . 
   i voted to remain you keep saying that , but as it 's impossible to verify as true or false , it 's altogether irrelevant .
