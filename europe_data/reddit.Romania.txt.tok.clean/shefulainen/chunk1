cactus cuz it does n't require much attention like the bonzai and i 'm a lazy bastard, 
  sounds like you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  more of that but on your fact-free ignoramus sub , please . 
  rofl tyt saying trump is tbe safer voice ... i remember cenk losing his mind and entering panic mode on election night as it was getting clearer and clearer he was going to win . 
  sure , there was jimmy dore who `` hated '' hillary with a passion but that does n't make him nor the rest of tyt irrational clowns that lie to push an agenda and also i do n't think he preferred trump over hillary either . 
  but yeah i guess you 're right , when there are only flawed candidates i guess you should suck it up , pick a side you thin its better and you should praise your side to the heavens no matter how bad that candidate is against your own views or no matter the facts that show he or she is a bad candidate and has no business representing you , right ? 
  why fight for what you believe in when you can be a sheep that just follows a side, 
  i mean both but mostly the democratic candidate since he did n't even run for dnc chair, 
  thanks for the input , i guess i did n't take into account how competent he is compared to bernie who i consider a hell of a politician who almost achieved something few thought possible , but the part on the public 's perception on leftist parties as you said is the sad part and i would n't attribute that to corbyn but to this whole apparatus set to oppose any political idea that would be in favor of the general population if it would hurt even a tiny bit the pockets of huge corporations and banks and etc, 
  thanks for explaining what i was trying to say in proper english, 
  thanks for your answer , i really have no info on his management of the party other than some random headlines and news i sometimes see about him so i did n't have any clue about how competent he is . 
  to me he seemed the bernie sanders of uk , but even tho i guess they fight for similar things the difference between him and bernie would be that bernie actually managed to inspire his base even without the name recognition and with the media being kinda biased against him, 
  and about the part on removing nuclear deterrents , no country will ever start removing their nuclear arsenal on their own without the other nuclear powers in the world doing the same thing , so if you consider people who want a world without nuclear weapons extremists then i really have nothing else to add to this conversation that would change your mind, 
  you did n't get my point , when i say right wing extremists i 'm not talking about regular fiscal conservatives or w/e , i 'm talking about people like trump who if you 're telling me the direction he wants to take the world towards is fine and dandy i 'm just not going to take you seriously anymore . 
  now please tell me how corbyn who believes in global warming and wants to do something about it , who belives in refugee rights and wants to help them to the extent that he can , who believes the west should stop bombing muslim countries , who believes certain parts of a society should n't be privatized for the benefit of corporations and not the citizens ( like healthcare ) , pls explain to me how some1 like you who is a centrist can find this guy an extremist and pls do n't tell me that its because he is on the other extreme of trump cuz that 's what i find to be incredibly stupid, 
  could you explain why ?? 
  i 'm genuinely curious cuz i see this blanket statement thrown around all the time but i never get why corbyn gets all the blame, 
  why is it true could you explain ?? 
  neither the article nor the people i always hear say this thing ever give a good explanation why he is a disaster and not the party he is trying to run, 
  why is he an extremist ?? 
  cuz he 's a pacifist ? 
  cuz he believes in socialism ?? 
  since when is caring for other peoples well-fare an extreme position ?? 
  i get this whole left wing vs right wing and if the right wing has extremists who wan na take the world towards a shittier place , then the other side has to have extremists who wan na do the same thing but in the opposite way and the only good way to go is in the middle , i get it i really do but i find it really fucking stupid . 
  corbyn is not a left-wing extremist , he simply talks about things that nobody talked about in a long time and now he has a big platform to do it so the people he 's speaking against do n't like it so they paint him that way to discredit him and the fact that its actually working when we have people like trump and putin and etc in this world is really fucking worrying, 
  to me , an outsider with not a good grasp on what is actually happening in britain and in the labour party , the corbyn situation is what would have happened in america if bernie sanders suddenly became leader of the democratic party surrounded by politicians who take lots of money from corporations and banks ... ofc there would be infighting and the party would seem in shambles , but at least someone at the helm of the party would actually try to steer things back in the right direction . 
  again i 'm not very informed on what 's happening in the labour party , but the way i see it corbyn is trying to fight against a political establishment created by blair which to me is a good thing, 
  lol wtf did birds do to you ? 
  he also said something along the lines that deporting people should be a military operation , i 'll try to find a link for you e : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-us-military-undocumented-immigrants-deport-threat-mexico-border-wall-a7597196.html, 
  did n't he do it in his own country ? 
  i know he was talking about sending the military to deport the `` bad dudes '', 
  the genuine desires of 12 year old kids who spend too much time on the internet do n't concern me tbh , i was pretty extreme myself when i was younger , if you do n't feed the trolls they will just starve to death is my point i guess, 
  that 's xenophobia , racism is strictly about race , both are bad just do n't confuse them and also please do n't act like a victim when your country has the baggage it has regarding discrimination, 
  no you ca n't , that 's xenophobia and i do n't think anyone hates the russian people around here ( i could be wrong tho ), 
  no they do n't and no1 in their right mind would suggest something like that so either these posts u saw were trolls and you should n't pay attention to them or you 're lying and spewing propaganda in which case fuck off, 
  we do n't hate russians , we hate putin , we hate the oligarchy in your country and we hate that russia tries to expand its influence to what it was in the past , i for one have nothing against the russian people and i think your women are the hottest in the world after our own ( maybe they share an equal spot ), 
  this is the best one so far, 
  its on youtube as well tho i 'm not sure if it was uploaded by the guys who made it, 
  i 've got no words to describe how much i love this woman and at the same time how bad i feel for her and the situation she 's in . 
  she deserves nothing but the best in this shitty world because she 's an amazing compassionate human being like you rarely ever find , and yet she struggles to get by day by day , on her own , without complaining and being grateful that she can make the world a cleaner and better place . 
  i 'm tearing up right now and i just wan na go hug that old lady and thank her for reminding me of the potential of goodness in every human being , cuz especially nowadays the world seems such a dark place and a shining light like this amazing woman can bring so much hope, 
  2 months after getting into power , the romanian prime-minister ( who is the puppet of the leader of the social-democrat party liviu dragnea , who could n't become prime-minister because of a criminal sentence he has on record ) passed an executive order through which stealing less than 45000 $ would n't be considered a criminal offense anymore . 
  this executive order was passed under the pretense that prisons in romania are overcrowded ( they are but this is not the solution to this problem ) with the actual intent of pardoning hundreds of corrupt politicians and other affiliates of theirs ( mostly from the social-democratic party ) . 
  the thing is they 've done this in the most slimy way possible , the people protested this law last weekend when they announced that they intend to pass it in parliament , even the president joined the protests and he said he wo n't sign the bill to be law , so their only choice left was to pass this executive order which they did in the middle of the night in secrecy like rats . 
  this happened tuesday night and the next day the population started protesting again in way larger numbers and has continued doing so with numbers increasing day by day , until 4 days later ( today ) the pm announced they will gather to discuss the best way to repeal this law , although they also said they want to pass a similar one this time in parliament with the input of the constitutional court . 
  for now this is a small victory and hopefully the corrupt politicians who are facing charges will also serve some well deserved jail time , but the war against these scum is far from over and tomorrow will probably be the biggest protest yet ( about 500.000 people are expected to show up just in the capital bucharest to protest ), 
  they are desperate , most of them including the leader of the party are facing jail time , for them its do or die and they were banking on the fact that the population would stay ignorant and uninformed like it used to happen in the past . 
  the thing is , romania in recent years got a taste of change towards a real democracy with actual rule of law ( we still got a long way to go to achieve that ) and the younger population does n't accept the bullshit any longer , so psd 's gamble really backfired and now they committed political suicide just 2 months after they got back into power, 
  i do n't think we can afford being optimistic with this kind of scum in power , rather i would expect the worse and be prepared to do anything in our power to actually bring the change we want, 
  its not over yet , they want to pass a similar law this time with the help of the parlament ( which they also control ) . 
  anyway , we have shown we ca n't be pushed over and we will fight any of their attempts to hurt our democracy and rule of law, 
  standard police riot tactics and the help of the legitimate protesters, 
  really good article that explains the situation pretty accurately, 
  no but most just prefer policies that get them more money , does n't matter if these policies hurt the people they represent or not, 
  smth smth deep state smth smth witch hunt smth smth gay frogs etc, 
  you 're on fire m8 , just like california where arnold was born, 
  religion drives them , western intervention just pushes the extreme sides of that religion and also gives them an enemy , i do n't understand what 's so hard to wrap your head around that if you hurt someone they will try to hurt you back and i also do n't understand why you as an average citizen would support something that you do n't gain anything from, 
  i just do n't see how you can agree with an american soldier being radicalized just because he comes from the same culture as you are but when a muslim does it he must have done it because he hates the west for some unrational motive . 
  both hate the other side and both are wrong and if we agree on that why ca n't we agree to see both sides in a similar light and expect the same thing from our side just like we expect from theirs . 
  if its because they are muslims and their actions stem from religion while ours stem from geopolitical interests then i stick by my earlier arguments that you think one side is inferior to the other for bullshit reasons, 
  i never said its simple and i never said it will automatically lead to `` peace '' , i said it certainly wo n't make things worse and it will start a path that can actually lead to peace . 
  also i agree that the radicalized muslims hate the west but i do n't stop there and i 'm actually interested in why they hate the west and what the west can do in order for this hate to stop spreading , and continuing bombing muslim countries certainly does n't help . 
  also i agree with amending immigration and so does corbyn so i do n't see where the problem is in this case , other than the fact that when you say ammending immigration you probably just want to stop muslims from entering europe which is stupid ( and if that 's not what you 're trying to say then i 'm sorry for thinking that you 're just some other right wing nutter who just hates muslims although i 'm not entirely convinced that you are n't ), 
  i 'm not lumping the entire west with the people in charge , i 'm from the west and i certainly do n't lump myself with these war criminals and there are other people like me , i lump the people in charge who want these wars with the idiots like you who support them and think there 's nothing wrong with them . 
  the american soldier joined the war because of bullshit propaganda just like the terrorist did a horrible act because of bullshit propaganda , its just that its different kinds of propaganda , one comes from the rulling class like you say and from corporations who do n't care about killing people for money , and one comes from a stupid backward religion and extremists who teach its most extreme practices in order to defend themselves against something that they see as threatening this backward religion . 
  both are wrong and i wish both would stop and i never treated them with completely different logic systems , in facts that 's exactly what you are doing and its concerning how you do n't realize you 're own argument work against you . 
  you think its ok that the american soldier went to war to avenge his country even tho we both know that the reason for going to war was a complete lie and propaganda , but for some reason you think the muslim who got radicalized in a similar way albeit from a different reason ( not money but religion ) is less of a human or smth than the american soldier . 
  i 'm here judging your comment and i find its filled with the same old right wing extremist propaganda and idiot bullshit they are spouting without any facts to support their claims . 
  how about change the foreign policy and see if it works out or not , cuz it certainly ca n't get worse than what is currently happening , why do n't you see the problem like this i do n't get it ? 
  and who said its gon na be easy ?? 
  do you realize how hard it will be politically to make the military and oil industries lose so much money by stopping intervention in middle-eastern countries or selling weapons to saudis and other terrorist sponsors ?? 
  do you realize how much money will be lost `` just '' to stop killing so many people for bullshit reasons ? 
  i do n't think you do , you 're just here to complain about muslims and how barbaric they are and present no solution to anything, 
   and doing the same thing over and over again while hoping for a different result is not a good way to run a country . 
  that 's good because corbyn wants to try a different direction . 
  what even is your argument i do n't get it , you do n't want to try a road towards peace but you do n't want things to go the same way either , what the fuck do you want to do other than banning a whole religion or starting another holocaust againt muslims ?? 
  or maybe you really think that these 2 `` policies '' are acceptable and wo n't do much more harm in which case i really think there 's no hope for you or for this world for this matter since there are lots more idiots like you who think like this and one even got to power in the most powerful country in the world, 
  the war on terror is just another bullshit reason for western interventionism in the middle east , a bullshit reason that 's accepted only by idiots and the mainstream media who are selling these wars for profits , the real reasons have always been controlling the oil and other geopolitical bullshit reasons ( like being buddy-buddies with the saudis ) . 
  western interventionism has been a problem ever since the cold war ( actually way before that ) and not only in the middle-east , but sure buddy you can keep your head in the sand and pretend that this all started after 9/11 , its not stupid at all rly, 
  its because he 's actually a leftist and not right-winger lite like some of his fellow colleagues and its because leftist policies are fairly popular right now since the right and center-right path has been tried for so long now with the end result being an increasing decline of the middle class and the rich getting obscenely more rich while the world goes to shit, 
  to me its capitalism with no breaks , little to no regulations for banks and corporations in order for them to trade as much and as easy as they can on a market that is as free as possible . 
  this hurts the interests of the average citizen however who is n't rich enough to own a business of his own so he has to work for these banks or corporations who have an interest to make profit which usually means that they prefer to pay bad wages , etc. 
  ( especially in the age of automation where more and more jobs disappear and the gains go more and more only towards the rich ) . 
  it also means easier immigration and free movement of labor so the corporations can hire unskilled immigrants for low end jobs to pay them next to nothing compared to what they would pay a regular citizen , which ofc drags wages lower some more and it feeds the bullshit narrative of the right-wingers that out of the millions that immigrate most are terrorists or undesirables or w/e other negative adjective , which ofc leads to people like trump or le pen gaining popularity etc, 
  yeah i did , problem ?? 
  is this an english class or smth and i 'm supposed to write shakespearian english or what ? 
  nice deflect though , but if you do n't have anything smart to reply back ( maybe you really are 12 ) then mb next time try not to say anything ** cuz ** it wo n't make you look so stupid, 
  ok , so can you bring a real argument to whatever you were trying to say other than i hate jc and i hate labour therefore everything coming from them sucks ?? 
  cuz it makes you look like a 12 year old also please tell me who are the people who will do something to stop it ?? 
  he 's been bragging about how isis will be gone 30 days after he enters office and you tell me what 's changed in 4 months since that happened . 
  theresa may will stop terrorism then ??? 
  there have been 2 attacks in 2 big english cities in the short time she 's been pm , what has she done to change anything ? 
  answer probably is that she cut the police force to make it harder to prevent such attacks . 
  my point is that this is a complicated problem , one that will probably never be solved entirely and continuing on this path which makes us attack every single muslim country we do n't like for bullshit reasons like `` war on terror '' or `` bring peace to the middle east '' ( the actual reasons being oil and big interests ) wo n't change a thing other than make it worse . 
  there need to be more people like corbyn who want to try a new direction , one towards peace and not war , one that has in mind the interest of the average people and not some economical or geopolitical bullshit , but even if there were more people like him it still would n't be enough cuz there are people like you who want to see change happen magically without actually changing anything . 
  i mean , please tell me what change you want to see happen ?? 
  you want to ban all muslims from europe ?? 
  you want to eradicate them from the face of the earth cuz they are a religion of violence ?? 
  peace is bad for you and asking to go in that direction is weak or something so please enfuckinglighten me with a solution, 
  bomb some more muslim countries , that will show the terrorists not to mess with us and it certainly wo n't help their recruitment campaign .
