street lighting is also done by water from the same nuclear power plant ( it 's fluorescent ) . 
  not sure about that . 
  i hear boris johnson wants to build a wall in northern scotland . 
  ( and make mexico pay for it , of course ), 
  nope . 
  nothing new . 
  uk still there , brexit is not done yet . 
  this . 
  we do n't appreciate art . 
  definitely the state should pay for more churches , to help increase the number of those who believe sun rotates around the earth . 
  only 2 in 10 ? 
  that 's scandalous !, 
   mostly for lack of alternatives why not spanish ? 
  or even brazilian ... :p, 
   was n't he the foreign secretary now nhs will get substantial extra funds after brexit !, 
  in your face , germoney !, 
  are we really making the difference between `` people '' '' and `` government '' ? 
  i know what you mean , but it 's a very slippery slope ... 
  there were no referendums on whether romania should take any loans . 
  can we stop paying now ? 
  dream on , dude . 
  madrid-sevilla is 2h by train in spain . 
  a similar distance , bucuresti-timisoara , is in theory 9h , in practice 10h by train in romania . 
  we still have a long way to go ... maybe we 'll get there , but not in 10 years for sure ; 20 is a highly-optimistic `` maybe '' . 
  let 's not get ahead of ourselves , we have a lot of work to do . 
  and will free hundreds of millions of pounds to be used on the nhs, 
  ooooh , but [ they often do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics ) , and quite massively so . 
  not saying it 's the case with russia , i totally expect putin to take no chance on the elections - but the title total bullshit . 
  i would have never guessed it . 
  i always thought that poland is hungary . 
  so what am i to understand from this ... you do n't want back parts like satmar or crisana , you just want a land area that has no connection whatsoever to hungary ? 
  yeah , i know , you like to consider yourself a special snowflake , outside of `` transylvania proper '' . 
  but truth is , by `` transylvania '' most people understand [ this map ] ( http://greentransylvania.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/transylvania-map.jpg ) . 
  look , i grew up there . 
  let 's not beat around the bush - you may not feel superior , but your average fellow co-regional does feel that transylvania ( including its people ) is * better * ( not just `` different '' ) than oltenia , moldova , muntenia/bucharest ... you name it . 
  double points for banat , they feel they 're better than the rest of transylvania too . 
   no catalin will say to john `` nice to meet you john , i 'm from transilvania '' . 
  a lorent will say that , though . 
  maybe , in this example ( if you replace `` will say that '' with `` may say that '' ) . 
  but your example does n't apply to current thread title - as my second paragraph suggests , there are good reasons for mentioning transylvania explicitly ( instead of just `` romania '' ), 
  i have to disagree with / u/uazaa and / u/dexiantoniu ( plenty of people of romanian nationality like to say they are from transylvania ... it 's kinda ' like catalunya in spain or bavaria in germany , they feel they 're superior to the rest of the country ) . 
  but , more to your point - it 's much more interesting to say `` armenian community in transylvania '' than `` armenian community in romania '' . 
  i knew we had armenians in romania , i did n't know we had an armenian community in transylvania ( despite the fact that i grew up + spent most of my life there ), 
  fine , but i might have to insignificantly increase the price , to 99.999 bln eur . 
  after i see the money in my account , i 'll personally deliver you the r8 limited edition , together with a notarised paper where i concede in your favour all my claims on those land territories . 
  includes [ big bulgaria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/soviet_union_-_russian_sfsr_\\ ( 1936 \\ ) . svg/2000px-soviet _ union _ - _ russian_sfsr _ \\ ( 1936 \\ ) . svg.png ) , with vodka and hookers !, 
  only 99.99 bln !, 
  pyotr , that guy is a scammer , he does n't own bulgaria . 
  contact me , i make you good deal , two bulgaria for the price of one . 
  so ... they decided to keep only accalia , adalwolfa , adoff , amaguk , amarog , bardalph , beowulf , bhangi , bjomolf , bledig , botewolf , botolf , bozkurtlar , cana , channing , chanteloup , chinua , conall , conwenna , dib and ethelwulf ? 
  to eliminate the clickbait :  but there 's a catch : everyone can also see exactly who 's looked at their tax returns . 
  who 's that guy from luxembourg ? 
  i ca n't tell . 
  even better , we could call it the holy romanian empire . 
  right ? 
  ( we never had an empire , folks ... c'mon , we wan na see how it is to be an empire ! ), 
   businessadvicefortheprofessionallyretarded@gmail.com the email bounced . 
  did you mistype the address by any chance ? 
  that 's because you do n't get it . 
  they 're all talking ... on imessages :p, 
   sent a song called `` boom boom boomerang '' it was n't a hit , so it returned home . 
   nigel farage look like a nice guy nigel ? 
  pffft ... [ this ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3871/14153414530_e01c9cb1c9_b.jpg ) is a nice-looking guy !, 
   i love how there are people who believe the eu is not authoritarian . 
  who is `` eu 's erdogan '' ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  confirmed : sumo is indeed an asian sport , but it was first developed in west-asia 7 thousand years ago , and over time the fighters migrated eastwards . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  you 'll move to ampelum ? 
  good luck with that . 
   and yet migrants are now crossing it illegally without being stopped . 
  ^ ( [ citation needed ] ) the rest is pure & irrelevant bullshit . 
  like `` villages '' ( 2-3-4 houses in isolated mountain areas ) that apparently need electricity for us to get into schengen ... 
  it 's generic . 
  look up their objections . 
  they 'd have no base to claim that romania 's borders are porous - due to corruption or anything else ( they 're not ; romania spent 1.5 billion eur to secure the border and , while there 's some suspicion on bribes that dna is still investigating , those bribes appear to be on the order of `` millions '' . 
  as far as i understand the vast majority of those money were actually spent usefully , on fairly high-tech electronic monitoring systems , communication equipments & the like . 
  i 've heard literally zero politicians , romanian or foreign , complain about the security of our border ) . 
  i see . 
  well , that 's how vw got in trouble , trying to achieve euro6 without adblue on some models :p, 
  formally ? 
  corruption ( though theoretically that 's not part of the criteria ) . 
  in practice ? 
  intemal politics ( see brexit ) + maybe some economic interests, 
  that 's because we 're talking here about the  modern mechanism used in diesels to combat emissions, 
  what do you mean ? 
  romania meets all schengen criteria for quite a while , the problem is that the member states need to acknowledge this . 
  so far , netherlands has always refused to ( and at times , various other countries joined position with netherlands ) . 
  do you even know how this works in small diesel cars ? 
  i have a euro6 diesel car from the infamous vw group . 
  i do indeed refill adblue every few thousand km , and of course i do n't go to service for that , i have an adblue tank in the trunk , and there are adblue cans [ like this ] ( http://www.kingfisherdirect.co.uk/image/cache/data/greenchem-adblue/includes-spouts-600x600.jpg ) in pretty much every gas station . 
  furthermore , the car wo n't start if the adblue tank is empty . 
  it prints a clear warning on the central console each time the adblue tank is low - something like `` you have 1000km remaining '' . 
  i wish the article is right and that we do move to electric cars . 
  that 'd be nice . 
  but i think we still have a way to go in order to get there ... 
   treaties are an input to law , but they are not the legal code what the hell do you mean ? 
  each country has to make `` eu law '' into their own law . 
  nobody is changing irish tax law retroactively , that 's more like a local law being found to be illegal/incompatible with higher laws , and as a consequence being cancelled ( & all its beneficiaries needing to return benefits ) . 
  surely you understand the concept because a lot of us courts apply similar penalties when deciding that something was illegal .
