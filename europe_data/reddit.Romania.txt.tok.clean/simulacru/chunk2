  take e.g. 
  the case about apple conspiring with publishers on book prices . . now apple has to pay back consumers . 
  is that retroactive application of the law ? 
  ( not a perfect analogy , i agree , but i 'm not familiar enough with us cases to find a better one ) . 
  `` why do the english drive on the right side '' ) . 
  which is a damn good question , since it 's very dangerous to drive on the right side in uk . 
   so , why are you leaving perth ? 
  they 've heard perth is in austria , i.e. 
  austria is upside down too !, 
  the bastards . 
  she 's not wrong , but she 's talking about a [ rather limited subset ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/millionaire-ehsan-abdulaziz-who-said-he-accidentally-tripped-and-penetrated-teen-is-cleared-of-rape-a6774946.html ) of the people on the streets of britain . 
  beh si le b\u00e2tard torture la langue ... 
  ... and your point is ? 
  really . 
  what , if germany does something , it must be a good idea ? 
  and a good idea for everybody , no less - not just for germany 's specific conditions ? 
  if you think so , i may have some suggestions for your country to implement ... which country is that ? 
  kinda misleading title . 
  i understood that the court confirms the glass cartel to be just fine . 
  ( which might not be so far off the truth , come to think of it ), 
  it 's tough to get rid of the miners ... [ we of all people should know that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad ) . 
  but i also believe long term it 's for the better ( including for the miner families ) , and furthermore , if you just ignore this the problem does n't get smaller with time . 
  there * will * be social turmoil in those areas , and that 's exactly the reason why your government needs to start making plans for it asap . 
  otherwise ... 
  i do n't want to know what 'll happen , but for sure it wo n't be anything good . 
  oh , and there 's also the `` small '' detail that you 're poisoning yourselves by burning coal in the cities . 
  it 's not like this is something the bad eu wants just to sell you more energy - it would be objectively better for you , at least from some p.o.v. , to wean yourselves off the coal . 
  ... and your point is ? 
  how about building a nuclear plant ? 
  are the french trying to keep the brits ( or immigrants that already made it to uk ) out of france ? 
  in ** almost 2 ** years ???!!, 
  oh wow ... that 's tragic . 
  i do n't see how the german industry can recover from that . 
  get someone like trump who 'll make the french pay for it . 
  really ? 
  but you can drive e.g. 
  from miami to anchorage , nobody really does it but that 's not the point of the roads , they do n't just connect 2 endpoints , they are infrastructure for all the stuff along the way . 
  also , you may not move people by road on such long distances , but sometimes it may make sense to move freight by road . 
  romanians would be very happy to get the us content for us prices ( which should be feasible if we have common eu regulations ) . 
  and i 'm talking about the `` before taxes '' price , here . 
  unfortunately , we get a much worse deal now . 
  so yeah , to the extent that we afford those accounts now - we would afford them in such a single market , too . 
  if you 're smart , you could win the case easily ... the question is , is it worth it to sue the employer ? 
  ( methodology for winning : after signing the blank resignation letter , you go to a notary and give a statement under oath that on date x , you were forced to sign a blank letter by employer y , and that you have no intention of actually resigning if you get pregnant . 
  then you get pregnant , and if you find out that you were `` resigned '' , you present the notarised declaration in court ) . 
  of course , the state could make this easier by simply passing laws that makes it basically impossible to fire a pregnant woman . 
  `` you can only resign during pregnancy if you give a notarised declaration of your intention to resign , go through 1 week of counselling paid for by the company , and then still maintain your decision by giving an additional notarised declaration that you 're sure you want to resign '' . 
  also , the capital city is budapest , not bucharest !, 
  ( or was it the other way around ? 
  i keep forgetting that ) . 
  and there are other places to invest besides the fucking eastern poland !, 
  and by that we mean center-right , not far-right . 
  we all hate homonazi jews . 
  that 's a lie , and you know it . 
  from quick skimming of [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_foreign_agent_law#implications_for_ngos ) - a ngo must then submit to extensive audits ( that takes manpower away from them ... `` inspectors '' do n't just come in & go away taking stuff you mostly do n't need , they disrupt your workforce by asking for assistance & documentation , and they take away critical documents , effectively preventing you from using them for a while ) - supervisory powers are allowed to intervene and interrupt the internal affairs of the ngo with suspensions for up to 6 months - they have to begin each oral statement with a disclosure that it is being given by a `` foreign agent '' . 
  this alone might skew results and make any polling done by levada irrelevant - in effect , forcing them to close down . 
  but ... but ... we 're on reddit !, 
  right . 
  how much of the us budget went into that concentrated effort ? 
  i 'd guess you need quite a handful of zeroes to describe the percentage ... which is probably not true for russian disinformation efforts . 
  and the mexicans to pay for it . 
  because , why not ? 
  yes ... the difference is that russia puts almost all of its resources into these shitty `` information wars '' , whereas the others put almost no resources at all . 
  want to make a comparison with `` california or italy '' so that you understand ? 
  how are your hospitals ? 
  schools ? 
  roads ? 
  can you travel by car from moscow to vladivostok in the winter ? 
  what percentage of your rural areas have access to internet , gas , electricity , water distribution networks , sewage ? 
  i think it 's easy to panic at the `` abilities '' of putin and how he `` plays chess while we play checkers '' , but in reality all we need to do is stand together and keep our heads cool . 
  if putin does n't manage to break apart eu and nato ( both are clear objectives of his !, 
  ) , then russia will implode . 
  i 'm actually more concerned with how russia breaks apart ( * ) . 
  they are on a tight deadline , and the odds are stacked severely against russia . 
  he ' a good tactician , but he 's no strategist - if you look at stuff like crimeea & donbass , this becomes painfully obvious ( got crimeea ... maybe temporarily ; lost ukraine , probably permanently . 
  great strategic move ! ) . 
  in short - while we should n't minimise the threat posed by putin ( and i actually think part of the refugee crisis problem is actually amplified by him , especially after he saw that `` it works '' ) - we do n't need to panic either . 
  ( * ) as bad as putin is , i would n't want the nuclear weapons to be in the hands of someone like kadyrov . 
  you did n't mention `` non-western '' . 
  also , the biggest russian oil company is lukoil , and they have at least one big refinery in romania ... plenty in other places , i suppose . 
  also , i looked up the largest oil companies in the world ... 3 out of first 4 are chinese , and not only do they have refineries , but they [ apparently run at 70 % capacity ] ( http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2016-09/04/content_26696060.htm ) due to being oversized for current consumption . 
  aramco , the largest oil company , also [ has plenty of refineries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saudi_aramco#list_of_refineries ) . 
  so , who is bullshitting ? 
  come on man . 
  i do n't even like any of the petrostates , and i downright despise putin and the saudi princes . 
  but you 're objectively wrong in your claims . 
  oh wow , there 's a crazy amount of putin-love in this thread . 
  can someone tell me exactly how anything he said is so `` thoughtful '' and `` intelligent '' and `` knowledgeable '' , and why exactly western leaders are `` clowns '' in comparison ? 
  ( if you 're thinking about farage , the apt equivalent in russia would be zhirinovsky , not putin ) . 
  i even see [ some questions considered ballsy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/518n5b/exclusive_interview_with_vladimir_putin_bloomberg/d7aat63 ) even though they are taken directly from [ dugin 's `` foundations of geopolitics '' ] ( http://www.4pt.su/en/content/aleksandr-dugin%e2%80%99s-foundations-geopolitics ) ... some balls , indeed . 
  that 's technically correct , but somewhat irrelevant . 
  `` oil empires '' do produce refined oil products , they do n't just extract oil . 
  and you must agree that e.g. 
  gasoline , paraffin wax or tar are ( a ) produced , and ( b ) useful . 
  pray tell me , what are those chains that `` ennaji loubna '' was talking about , and why was she making the emancipated personal choice of wearing the chains ? 
   incl . 
  taiwan so ... also china ? 
  : runs_for_his_life :, 
  awesome . 
  so i tell you how i feel about something that i perceive a symbol , and your solution is `` educate yourself about other uses of said symbol '' .
