  and i just said it 's the same with swastika ... try to explain to the jews that you 're wearing it as a symbol for good fortune ( that 's literally what the word means )  their personal preference is to dress modestly . 
  really ? 
  well , i 'm not a native english speaker , but the first synonym for `` modest '' that google gave me was `` self-effacing '' , i.e. 
  `` not claiming attention for oneself '' . 
  modest , my ass . 
  wearing a burkini on a beach is anything but modest . 
  oppression of women . 
  look , we have fkk beaches . 
  i would n't even mind having `` burkini beaches '' - that may be a genuinely good idea . 
  i still find it offensive on the regular beach - it smells like `` in your face '' militants  how is it possible that in a ` modern ' world , tanning naked is accepted but keeping your clothes on at the beach is not ? '' right there , awesome use of quotes . 
  they consider being naked while bathing more `` unnatural '' than being fully dressed ... and ignore the fact that fkk beaches are separate , and that actually only a backwards religion would subject them to unnecessary clothing . 
  i get it that they 're psychologically conditioned to be uncomfortable while naked , but there 's nothing natural about that . 
  it 's them who get the modernism wrong , it 's them who had the unfortunate bad luck to grow up in a backwards society . 
  please do n't impose that on us . 
   `` every time i visit morocco , i feel and see more freedom than here in the west . '' seriously ? 
  i hate to say this , but the immediate reaction i get to this , is `` well , just go ! '' . 
  enjoy your freedom there , we seriously would n't want to be keeping you here against your will . 
  it is unfortunate that it has come down to this , but i ca n't empathise with the people who decry `` fascism '' in europe , while at the same time refusing to understand the european sensibilities . 
  look gals , it 's really simple : we do n't like people wearing swastikas , even though they are `` just a sign '' ( and a very old one !, 
  and not inherently criminal ! ) . 
  same way we do n't like nazism , we do n't like militant islam , because it 's really another side of the same coin . 
  it 's criminal , it 's oppressive , it 's anti-liberal ... it 's against everything we stand for . 
  so , while i appreciate the beauty & simplicity in the design of the swastika ( as well as it 's original meaning ) , i do n't use it - it 's not `` just a sign '' . 
  while you may like the burkini , understand that for me it 's not `` just a cloth '' , it 's a symbol . 
  and i do n't like what it stands for . 
   they simply copy-pasted the chinese ? 
  no way . 
  i ca n't believe that . 
   i did n't switch anything i meant , from my estimation ... it was confusing as it made a direct comparison with ro very hard . 
  but you 're right , i misread your message , the percent drop is correct ( and huge ! ), 
  regardless of currency . 
   tallinn gramar ^ ^ * nazi :p ( i wrote tallinn correctly the first time ! ), 
  ^ ( * yes . 
  single m . what are you gon na do about it ? ), 
  you switched to usd , and you miscomputed . 
  what you need to do is to subtract tallinn gdp from estona gdp , subtract talinn population from estonia population , and then re-do gdp per capita without the capital city , to see what 's the drop/increase in the gdp per capita of `` estonia without talinn '' vs `` all of estonia '' . 
  as a comparison - the figures are even more dramatic for romania : ~ $ 9500 gdp per capita for the country , vs. ~ $ 18500 gdp per capita for bucharest . 
  i made the computation for 2013 ( that 's they year where there 's data on bucharest in wikipedia ) . 
  gdp per capita was 6226.15 eur for ro without bucharest , vs. 7081.5 for ro with bucharest . 
  so , a drop of 12.08 % - not nearly as high as greece . 
  it 's actually between finland and sweden . 
  i hate these kind of stats with passion . 
  there are 46 countries in europe ( 40 if you exclude the micro-states , which would really make sense in this case ) . 
  how hard can it be to list all of them ? 
  for god 's sake , at least put everyone in the eu , and make the title about `` eu '' not `` europe '' , at least it your article would make sense this way . 
  what do you want me to copy-paste my original message again ? 
  does n't seem you read it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zb435/turkey_begins_antiis_campaign_in_syria_bbc_news/d6uz1x0 nobody outside turkey ( and saudi arabia . 
  and isis . 
  nice company , there ) recognises ypg as terrorists . 
  only turkey allies ( eu , nato , us ) recognise pkk as terrorists - un , china , russia do not . 
  if you claim they are one and the same , it is only reasonable to assume that in fact pkk are not terrorists either and are only recognised as such by eu+us+nato in order to appease turkey . 
   are you trying to convince us that pkk is not a terrorist organisation ? 
  i see . 
  well , may turks disagree , but you 're entitled to believe they 're not terrorists :p, 
  i added an `` edit '' . 
  the risk is that you gradually decrease your competitiveness , and that can end up hurting you more in the long run . 
  but like you said ... hopefully sch\u00e4uble & the rest know what they 're doing . 
  just know that i lived through that kind of policies and it was n't with a happy ending . 
  germany does n't have big `` natural resources '' windfalls like russia , they need to keep their competitiveness top-notch . 
  is n't the budget surplus after paying debts ? 
  in other words , the government did n't use that money to repay debts ( they might do it in the future , but they did n't do it now ) . 
  it 's like having a deposit & a credit at the same time - definitely doable , just because you have extra money does n't mean that you chose to pay your credit with it . 
  for all you know , they might just put the money in a `` federal reserve fund '' like russia did . 
  [ edit ] also , ceausescu did exactly that . 
  he squeezed all the revenue to repay debts ( ahead of time ! ) . 
  pretty much all economists agree that it was a stupid move , and that those money would 've been better reinvested . 
  because it 's not that easy to do `` big bag investments '' when you 're debt-free , what we ended up with was outdated infrastructure & industry , the `` zero debt '' did n't help us much , we ended up indebted again by importing stuff we could n't ( or could no longer ) do ourselves . 
  now , definitely germany is * not * in the same position . 
  but still , i 'm wired to see big `` budgetary surplus '' as a negative . 
   to say they 're not even sided with them ? 
  that 's just a full on 100 % lie . 
  they definitely are , did i say that they 're not ? 
  i was just pointing out that by transitivity , pkk is allied to turkey . 
   to say they 're not essentially the same thing ? 
  that 's 100 % white washing . 
  * the united states , russia , the united nations , china , nato and the european union are allies of the ypg and not only do they support it but actually cooperate with that group . 
  neither of them recognises ypg as a terrorist organisation . 
  * un , china , russia have not recognised pkk as a terrorist organisation ... however , eu , usa and nato have recognised it as a terrorist organisation . 
  now , one man 's terrorist is another man 's `` freedom fighter '' , but the preponderance of evidence says that if ypg is really exactly the same as pkk , then it 's more likely that pkk is * not * terrorist ( and nato , usa , eu recognised it as such in order to appease turkey ) than it is to say that ypg is terrorist ( basically , nobody outside turkey and saudi arabia sees them as terrorist ) are you trying to convince us that pkk is not a terrorist organisation ? 
  well , if ypg is allied with pkk , and usa are allies of ypg , and turkey is allied with usa ... does that make pkk allied with turkey ? 
  is that really all that good news ? 
  are german schools and hospitals in no need of investment ? 
  i know the german roads are good ... but even so , with such massive infrastructure ... nothing to repair ? 
  is the army not in need of additional broomsticks ? 
  the point is - you can view `` surplus '' not as a sign that everything is rosy , but that as a sign that the government does n't have the capacity to spend all that money wisely . 
  [ edit ] . 
  it 's a question . 
  tell me how i 'm wrong , do n't just downvote . 
  why is a huge surplus `` good news '' ? 
  romanian singer nicu covaci was driven away by securitate ( romania 's version of kgb ) ... when returning home in the '90s he saw that some of the very same people were still ruling , and expressed his dismay in [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adro9oumolc ) - `` in the shadow of the big bear '' ( play of words , `` urss '' , which is how you write `` ussr '' in romanian , reads like `` urs '' , which means `` bear '' - a rather nice coincidence ) . 
  i find it captures rather well the crushed hopes of a generation ; fortunately , things are looking better now , though `` the old guard '' is still far from being completely driven away . 
  [ images are somewhat cheesy , but i included this version of the video because it 's translated and you get a fairly good idea of the song 's content from the translation . ], 
  no , i 'm afraid that one was n't . 
  ( and yes , that one was pretty stupid ... that 's why i said `` well played , if it was played as a humorous response . 
  '' , in the first place ), 
  well played , if it was played as a humorous response . 
  extremely stupid , otherwise . 
  start with orban 's head , see if it works . 
  deer lord , what the duck are you talking about ? 
  no you wo n't .
