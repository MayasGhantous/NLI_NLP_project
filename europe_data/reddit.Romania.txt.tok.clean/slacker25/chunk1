* romania ( born , raised , lived as an adult ) * canada ( studied , lived as an adult ) * us ( currently living in ) * spain ( visited , briefly lived as an adult ) * france * netherlands * bulgaria * moldova * australia * belgium ( very briefly ) * uk ( very briefly ) georgia and greece would be high on my `` to visit '' list . 
  there are things i like and dislike about all of them so i have a hard time picking favorites , but i have to say i did n't like brussels ( the only part of belgium i actually visited ) too much . 
  that sounds a bit like \u0219odo ( which is basically a romanian misspelling of chaud d'eau ) . 
  it 's made with egg yolk , sugar and milk rather than just egg yolk and sugar , though . 
   apart from quebec maybe you might be surprised . 
  quebec 's desire to preserve its language has resulted more in rejecting the us 's cultural influence than the uk 's ( whose presence has been much lengthier and predates quebec nationalism ) . 
  in anglophone canada , the american influence is huge ( seriously , toronto might as well be part of northeastern us ) , in quebec ... not so much . 
  frankly , once you got over the language thing , you might feel more at home in quebec than in the rest of canada . 
  from nato even more so . 
  let 's be honest , moldova has a * long * way to go before being a viable eu candidate but joining nato may have been feasible . 
  however no country with significant border disputes can be in nato ( with exceptions , granted ) so transnistria guarantees no nato for moldova ... 
  it means ( good ) luck .

  what sucks about hertza is that , unlike basarabia , bucovina and bugeac , the region was n't lost until 1944 so it 's much more of a `` recent '' loss than the others . 
  that being said , its population is roughly equal to that of a mid-sized small town , so making it too much of an issue ... 
  in fairness , if we 're talking about the carpathian * basin * , you could make a pretty convincing argument that it ends at the [ southwestern carpathians ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_romanian_carpathians ), 
  there are old bunkers littering the black sea coast . 
  i have no idea why our enlightened rulers thought the danger would come from our tiny , mostly secure shoreline as opposed to our long and indefensible northeastern and northwestern borders , but ... [ romania is the defend !, 
  reasonably safe but it 's a densely populated city of 2 million people so you should be careful . 
  i see you 're from canada . 
  having lived in both cities , i 'd say bucharest is comparable to montreal in terms of safety . 
  one thing : bucharest * does * have stray dogs . 
  not as many as there used to be , but still some . 
  keep your distance from them at all times , even the friendliest one is perfectly capable of biting if it feels threatened and can very easily feel threatened by someone it does n't know . 
  if you leave them alone , they 'll do the same . 
  i figured as much , i just could n't pass up the opportunity for a little banter , 
  i meant that the territories in question are n't seen as romanian . 
  and if that 's what you meant too , then ... clay is always welcome , i guess ... 
  nah , we only bring them up to troll you guys . 
  the romanian population in those areas is small and they were never part of either romania or any of the three principalities , so nobody sees them as romanian in any way . 
  except 14-year old nationalists on youtube , of course ... 
  moldova reverted back to using the latin alphabet after it broke away from the ussr . 
  its national language is already officially declared to be romanian and , iirc , ~ 80 % of moldova 's population are native romanian speakers . 
  integrating moldova into romania would cause 99 problems but language ai n't one . 
  wait ... egypt ? 
  are land claims from 50bc still valid ? 
  [ yeah , greater romania . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_romania ) i doubt anyone seriously considers re-annexing the territory that was lost to bulgaria or ukraine , but unification with moldova is still a fairly popular idea . 
  mulatru ( a ) is sometimes used for people of mixed romanian and gypsy ancestry . 
  it 's not really a nice term , but i would n't call it offensive or racist ... 
  the most believable theory i 've heard is that it was inspired by the [ eruption of thera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minoan_eruption ) and the resulting tsunami . 
  i think hahol is regional , i 've only ever heard it in dobrogea and am ~ 95 % sure it was adopted from the lipovans . 
  muscal is antiquated . 
  i 'm surprised you 've never heard rusnac , though ... 
  i honestly have no idea . 
  i think they 're just supposed to `` sound hungarian '' or something ... also , typo : second one is `` boanghen '' . 
   hairy-soled ( i.e. 
  hairy soles of feet ) -- romanian ( i guess this comes from traditional footwear ) nope , it 's because we 're hobbits . 
  a few of the top of my head : * bozgor , boanghen : hungarian * rusnac , muscal : russian ( second is antiquated ) * rusnac , hahol : ukrainian * ceafa-lata : bulgarian ( means `` thick neck '' ) * turcaflet : turk * macaronar : italian ( means `` pasta eater '' ), 
  i have close relatives in france and some distant ones in germany and moldova . 
  tbh , i 'm not sure the ones from moldova still live there ( pretty sure the ones in germany do , though ) . 
  very , very , * very * slim pickings for us ( unless you go for the debatable and/or fringe bullshit ) , but i 'll go with [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edeleanu_process ) , named after [ this dude . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laz\u0103r_edeleanu ) gasoline turned out to be a thing . 
   other former principalities that were occupied by the ottomans . 
  fyi we actually were n't , and transylvania is far from having never been under ottoman influence . 
  i do n't necessarily disagree with your point of view , but reality is n't as black and white as that . 
  how many times they distill fruit brandy . 
  i do n't remember how we saw it in class , but [ here 's how i see it . 
  on the other hand , we have a shitfuckton of `` union squares '' ... 
  is the food really that different ? 
  aside from the mucenici debate , transylvania 's tendency to put hot peppers in everything and dobrogea 's tendency to put fish in everything , i ca n't really think of anything big ... edit : oh yeah , and the slanina vs pastrama debata . 
  to add to what you said , there are also some religious differences : muslims are heavily concentrated in dobrogea , catholics and protestants in transylvania , and jews used to be concentrated in moldova . 
  there is one . 
  it starts with `` buburuza ruza '' and i 've forgotten the rest of it ...  gods little cow there is an insect called `` god 's cow '' in romanian ( vaca domnului ) , but i 'm not sure it 's the ladybug . 
   1 ) how do the british feel about the american war of independence ? 
  do you think you were wrong or right ? 
  is it taught in a way that makes it seem you actually won ? 
  ( similar to vietnam here ) this question can be applied to other colonial wars of independence , too , like france and spain . 
  none of our business . 
   2 ) how do the french ( and the rest of modern europe ) feel about napoleon ? 
  none of our business . 
   3 ) i have heard many times that germany has a lot of guilt about wwi & wwii , but what about austria , hungary , turkey , and italy ? 
  we were on the right side in ww1  as for ww2 , i think most people agree that joining the axis was justified given the context . 
  unfortunately , many are still ignorant as to our participation in the holocaust . 
  those that are n't consider it a national shame . 
   4 ) are there still socialist parties in parts of more westernized eastern europe like poland , slovakia , and hungary ? 
  is the cold war seen as a mistake on the part of your country ? 
  is it seen more as you being forced into it ? 
  is america framed as the bad guy at all in that time period ? 
  we were forced into it , and people were hoping for the us to come liberate us ... 
  the `` socialist '' ( but not really ) party is still dominant though , unfortunately . 
  aside from what you mentioned , most people agree that the annexation of southern dobrogea was a mistake and that the balkan wars were none of our business . 
  the geopolitical equivalent of removing a tumor using a battle-ax . 
  someone on / r/polandball described hearing romanian as follows ( paraphrased , of course ) :  hey !, 
  this is italian ... no it is n't ... actually , it could be a dialect ... uh ... is that a russian word ? 
  oh boy , where do i start ... 
  i guess the biggest one would be a sort of deeply entrenched short-sighted individualism . 
  individualism tempered by long-term thinking is a great thing since it motivates people to take care of their own problems without making things difficult for others or undermining the social order as , in the long run , such things end up making everything harder for everyone . 
  combined with short-term thinking , however , it results in endemic behaviour aimed at improving one 's * immediate * situation at the expense of everyone else which is , at best , unpleasant and , at worst , mildly anti-social ... hence widespread rudeness , corruption , disregard for public spaces , etc. . . on a lighter note , manele ( trashy turko-gypsy music ) . 
  i just hate that shit . 
  the drinking culture can also be a problem in the countryside . 
  edit : i think / u/elmiraguth was talking about something similar to the first thing i mentioned .
