  i do n't think she is either , though ... 
  to be honest , gypsies tend to be quite easy to tell apart physically ... 
  this is * very * much a belgian thing . 
  i remember a friend from belgium telling me most apartments had one in belgium . 
  i thought it was weird ... 
  russia 's population is comparable to that of all the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 * put together * , and its economy and hdi are either comparable ( 2007 ) or worse ( 2004 ) . 
  i 'll let you imagine what a shitstorm russia 's accession would cause ... 
  [ it was short-lived and established mostly due to soviet influence . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_autonomous_region ), 
  what are you referring to ? 
  the only one i can think of would be the autonomous magyar region that only existed for ~ 10 years at the beginning of communism . 
  the romanian principalities had autonomous regions , but that 's a bit of a different discussion . 
  romania \u2192 canada \u2192 romania \u2192 canada \u2192 spain \u2192 us \u2192 tba i 'd use a `` world '' flair if i could , like i do on / r/europe . 
  meh , i do n't know about that . 
  looking around the ` hood it seems to me that , for poor countries with weak institutions , autonomous regions are more likely to be a liability than a boon \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  romania is highly centralized and it 's been a source of discussion since , roughly , forever . 
  some devolution of powers would probably be for the best , but this needs to be done carefully and intelligently so as to promote cooperation rather than competition ... and our track record for careful and intelligent government reforms is unimpressive ... as for regional * autonomy * , that is against the constitution . 
  well ... if you * insist * , i can think of a way you could be reunited with transylvania ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i hate to say it but i do n't think ukraine will get crimea back . 
  not exactly with the country , but there 's [ a number of places called `` rom\u00e2ni '' in romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rom%c3%a2ni ) ( and moldova , just saying ) . 
  there 's even more of them if you include all those that have rom\u00e2ni as * part * of the name . 
   it always feels wrong to click `` agree '' to something which you 'd follow with a `` but ... '' irl . 
  i 've always interpreted it as : * strongly agree : yes !, 
  * agree : yes , but ... * neutral : well , it depends ... * disagree : no , but ... * strongly disagree : no !, 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=46.3&amp;d=52.1&amp;g=63.8&amp;s=68.2 ) that being said , i 've lived in a number of countries besides romania and am currently in the us . 
  amusingly enough , targoviste was probably more significant from a historical point of view . 
  at rovine and vaslui , the ottomans were only testing out the principalities ' military capability and calugareni was a local front of an austro-ottoman war whereas targoviste fended off an actual annexation attempt . 
  for some reason though , it does n't have the same amount of pop culture cred \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  [ rovine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_rovine ) , [ vaslui ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vaslui ) and [ calugareni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_c%c4%83lug%c4%83reni ) are the ones we circlejerk about the most . 
  fairly important in securing us * some * degree of autonomy from the ottoman empire proper , though luck and diplomacy probably played a bigger role in the long run . 
   any relation , though ? 
  my mom lost her temper one time when i was being a complete brat and gave me a slap . 
  i remember because she apologised for it afterwards , which made me respect her even more . 
  i 'm quite the exception though , unfortunately . 
  hey !, 
  must ... refrain ... from ... racist ... joke ... 
  i find romanian spoken with a * slight * moldavian accent to be lovely ( a heavy one just sounds weird ) . 
  muntenian is - like everything from muntenia - average and unremarkable , the transylvanian accent sounds like a speech impediment and i have no idea where banat got its accent from but it 's wrong ( seriously , `` t '' is not `` c '' ) . 
  they do n't . 
  statistics are fuzzy due to under-reporting , but both the high and low estimates agree that [ turkey is the country with the largest gypsy minority . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) they migrated from northwest india to central europe via turkey and their pattern of settlement clearly shows that ( turkey -  bulgaria/macedonia -  romania/serbia -  hungary -  slovakia ) . 
  the slavery part is true , though . 
  i 've actually wondered if romania might not have been objectively ( not just symbolically ) better off with the presence of the king as a ceremonial but respected figurehead that could steer public opinion in a saner direction from time to time ... oh well , that ship has sailed and it is n't coming back . 
  +1 , though i know this is n't a popular opinion on reddit . 
  [ fun fact  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_i_of_romania#return_and_rehabilitation )  in 1992 , the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations , where he drew large crowds . 
  even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace ( now the national museum of art of romania ) , his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him . 
  meh ... * gypsies are primarily concentrated in the balkans + hungary + slovakia . 
  nobody in that region has clay to spare , and having a gypsy homeland far from where they actually live would be weird . 
  * most countries with significant gypsy minorities are already in the eu so , unless rromastan had eu membership right from the start ( it wo n't ) , gaining citizenship wo n't be very attractive . 
  * my mom taught for awhile in a school in a. . . let 's say disadvantaged ... neighbourhood of bucharest . 
  to quote one mother , black as midnight on a moonless night , on why she would n't send her children to school `` i 'm not sending my kids there , that 's a gypsy school ! '', 
  i 'm sure you can see the relevance ... 
  romanian cuisine is actually not that bad from the health angle . 
  it tastes fattier than it really is , good balance of protein , carbs and fat with lots of vegetables . 
  the real problem is that it takes way too long to cook . 
  if i make a mushroom stew , which is a very simple recipe to begin with , it takes 10-15 mins to chop everything up and 10-15 mins to saute it followed by 30-40 mins in the oven ... and i still have to make some meat to go with that . 
  by comparison , i can fry eggs or meat in butter then make instant rice with the remaining grease and a soup cube ... and i have a complete meal in 15 minutes . 
  edit : and to answer op 's question , i go to church once or twice a year and that 's about it . 
  * kissing , opposite genders : very common , once on each cheek * kissing , two girls : see above * kissing , two dudes : not really , only for * very * close friends and family members * hugging : hell to the no , it was actually a small culture shock to me that it 's the opposite in the us, 
  i 've said it before , but ... eggplant salad ( salata de vinete ) . 
  big fan of mashed beans ( fasole batuta ) and eggplant/capsicum/mushroom puree ( zacusca ) too ... 
  i like spreads . 
  that answer combined with that flair made me do a double-take ... ( soup noodles are called fidea in romanian ), 
  just because i like to be contrarian , i 'm going to slightly disagree with you . 
  to begin with , while romania * is * a nation-state , ethnic minorities have always been an important part of it . 
  for instance , the [ first romanian to make a significant contribution to science ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiru_haret ) was ethnically armenian and [ one of the leaders of the 1848 revolution ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_tell ) was ethnically german . 
  why should they not be considered part of our nation ? 
  aside from which , i find it hard not to have a little sympathy for hungarians in transylvania . 
  imagine , as an exercise in empathy , that as an ethnic romanian you were born not in romania but , say , her\u021ba ... 
  and what does that change , in practice ? 
  germans and hungarians in interwar romania had full religious tolerance , citizenship rights , minority language schools , etc. . . 
  same as the , smaller but existant , german and hungarian minorities in pre-war romania ... and better than the jewish , russian and turkish minorities , for that matter . 
  better for everyone except for the kingdom of romania who lost 7 % of its population in a war it had no reason to join aside for the entente 's promised territorial concessions ... and the 55 % of ethnic romanians in transylvania ( and 10 % of ethnic germans ) who voted for the union with romania ... and the 30 % of ethnic hungarians in transylvania who voted to remain in hungary ... 
  in short , better for everyone except for everyone . 
  also , and this is a cheap shot but i 'll say it anyway , the percentage of ethnic romanians in interwar romania was the same as the percentage of ethnic poles in interwar poland . 
  would you be comfortable applying a similar logic to it ? 
  this is going to be an * extremely * unpopular opinion , and by that i mean that i expect it to be `` beneath threshold '' , but a better solution would have been for romania to not extend as far as it did . 
  restrict our westward expansion to the [ lands of the historical principality of transylvania ] ( http://romaniatourism.com/romania-maps/wallachia-moldavia-transylvania-map.gif ) and organize a voluntary population exchange with hungary . 
  basically the same deal we made with bulgaria for dobruja , which permanently closed * that * discussion and allowed us to , eventually , have peaceful and friendly relations . 
  good fences make good neighbours . 
  oh well ... too late now ... 
  can confirm that we confuse you with russia ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  nitpick : top left is muntenia . 
  bottom left is oltenia ( lion ) combined with banat ( bridge ) . 
  [ sauce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_romanian_coats_of_arms#banat_region ), 
  [ wiki summarizes it pretty well for the 18th and 19th centuries , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania%e2%80%93russia_relations#territorial_clashes ) to which should be added the [ tatarbunary uprising , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatarbunary_uprising ) the [ occupation of northern bukovina and bessarabia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_bessarabia_and_northern_bukovina ) and the [ soviet occupation of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_romania ) from the 20th century ... 
  [ we 're fans !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita#2010_who_data ) one thing i 've noticed is that drinking habits in romania lean more towards a `` drink small amounts throughout the day '' pattern than a `` binge drink until you ca n't stand up anymore '' one . 
  the latter is really not socially acceptable . 
  romanians and hungarians are natural enemies . 
  like romanians and russians . 
  or romanians and turks . 
  or romanians and other romanians . 
  damned romanians ... 
  they ruined romania !, 
  i guess the most unique one would be the [ zmeu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zmeu ) it 's the standard villain in romanian fairy tales and is , somehow , simultaneously a dragon , an ogre and , sometimes , a magician . 
  aside from that , a surprising amount of fairies : good fairies are called z\u00e2ne , evil fairies iele , and you also have s\u00e2nziene which are ambiguous . 
  as for ... * sigh * ... vampires , they are n't a very important part of romanian folklore but the closest thing would be strigoi , which are more of a vampiric ghost or magician than an actual vampire .
