  muntenia/dobrogea master race . 
  although , tbh , standard romanian uses muntenian phonology and moldavian grammatical conventions . 
  bucharest only became prominent around the 16-17th century , so there are n't that many really old buildings . 
  i think the [ mihai voda monastery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihai_vod%c4%83_monastery ) is the oldest one ( it came very close to being demolished during communist times , btw ) . 
  i think the building with the oldest history is the [ baratie church , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucharest_b%c4%83r%c4%83%c8%9bia ) which was founded in the 14th century , but the current building only dates back to the 18th . 
  in romania as a whole , i think the oldest still-standing building is the [ densu\u0219 church . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/densu%c8%99_church ) in its current form , it dates to the 13th century but parts of it are almost certainly much older . 
  a lot of technical terms in romanian are from german as well . 
  off the top of my head : \u0219urub ( from schraube ) , borma\u0219in\u0103 ( from bohrmaschine ) , \u0219aib\u0103 ( from scheibe ) , etc. . . 
  [ fun fact : from 1944 to 1947 , we were the world 's only communist kingdom .

  not exactly keep track , but they did pass down some `` family folklore '' . 
  most interesting stories : * i come from petty nobles/landowners on my dad 's side , of which one branch was actually of the high nobility . 
  then , in the late 18th century , one of my great ^ ^ n - grandfathers sold most of our lands to pay off his gambling debts , after which the family strategy was to marry wealthy but lower-born women . 
  it 's nice to know that my forefathers may have been idiots , but at least they had game . 
  * my grandfather on my mom 's side was ethnically german . 
  according to family folklore , his grandfather ( or great - , i do n't remember ) was an austrian officer who wound up in bucharest during the crimean war when austria occupied it . 
  there was a rumour going around that austria would annex it after the war , so he decided to spend most of his money buying land while it was still cheap . 
  shit did n't play out the way he expected it to ... 
  i do n't know if it 's unique to romania but i doubt too many countries can have , in the same region , temperatures of 40c in summer and [ this bullshit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as9hac3wc9g ) in winter ...

   prague - hardly people who drink blood of the rural people why do provincials always say this about the capital ? 
  people should state which region they 're from before answering , i assure you stereotypes are n't the same from to another . 
  anyway , here 's the stereotypes i 've encountered in bucharest : * bucharest : dishonest assholes * muntenia ( south central ) : rural bucharest , peasents and gypsies * dobrogea ( southeast ) : seaside bucharest , turks and gypsies * moldova ( northeast ) : two-faced alcoholics , half of bucharesters come from there * transylvania ( northwest ) : hard-working but dumb , hungarians and gypsies * oltenia ( southwest ) : lazy and talk a lot of shit but ca n't back any of it up, 
  country/people : that we still exist . 
  seriously , * you * try being the buffer zone between three empires for 500 years and see how you like it . 
  europe : 72 years without a world war and counting :p, 
  i learned that the baltics are arranged in alphabetical order . 
  poland keeps the pattern going , belarus is the combo breaker . 
   romanian if they ever claimed to be central european there 's some degree of debate about that . 
  people from transylvania tend to identify with central europe , but other romanians ... not so much . 
  personally , i could n't care less - i think culture is a continuum rather than a classification anyway - but i always find it weird when people place romania and moldova in different groups . 
  there 's some cultural differences , sure , but i 've been to places * in * romania that felt more foreign than chisinau ... 
  central europeans are like vegans . 
  how do you tell one apart ? 
  do n't worry , they 'll tell you . 
  there might be a few politicians ( actually , i think it 's just basescu ) who advocate uniting with moldova . 
  aside from that , nah . 
  iirc , romania formally renounced any land claims when it joined nato . 
  [ romania has a hungarian enclave right in the middle of it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kely_land ) aside from that , each historical region has its own vibe but i would n't say it is to the point that any of them are more similar to another country , including the ones that are split between us an a neighbour . 
  at least not any of the ones i 've been to . 
  [ you showed up sixty years too late ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin_americanii ! ), 
  still , better late than never . 
   i mean two different languages . 
  where do you draw the line between dialects and languages ? 
  [ there 's a lot of phrases that are * very * similar in romanian and aromanian . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanian_language#common_words_and_phrases ) also , literally any phrase in romanian and moldovan :p, 
  first of all , let me emphasize that romanians have nothing against russia ** ns ** , the people . 
   what is the state of your country 's relationship with russia ? 
  bad . 
  it is seen as a looming threat and source of instability . 
  and frankly , seeing as how 2/5 neighbours are either in active ( ukraine ) or frozen ( moldova ) conflicts with russia , and it has invaded us 2 or 3 times ( depending on how you count ) in the past 100 years , it 's not all that unfounded . 
   how have things changed in the last 5-10 years ? 
  relations have worsened . 
  the war in ukraine has made romanians more concerned than before , the anti-missile shield has made russia more vocal than before . 
   where will things be 5-10 years from now ? 
  probably the same . 
  i see no way , or reason , for them to improve . 
  i also see no way for russia to do anything in romania , or much in moldova , and romania wo n't do anything to upset the status quo , so they 're unlikely to worsen further . 
  probably belarus or kosovo . 
  russia would depend a lot on where . 
  moscow or st.petersburgh , sure ... bumfuck in the middle of siberia , no !, 
  i 'd be cool with moldova though ( since many have said that ) . 
  hell , i have cousins over there ... maybe we can go bowling . 
  [ belarus has a higher murder rate than bosnia , kosovo , macedonia or moldova ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ), 
  the year is 1828 . 
  [ war broke out between russia and turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war_ ( 1828 % e2 % 80 % 931829 \\ ) ) ( for , like , the fifth time ) and the russian army occupied the ottoman vassals of moldavia and wallachia ( for , like , the third time ) . 
  business as usual , you might say , except that after the end of the war the russians were like [ `` nah fam , i think we gun ' stick around ... there 's , like , actual sunlight here '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulamentul_organic#adoption_and_character ) , installed a russian governor and began campaigning for the new territories to be officially annexed . 
  five years later turkey paid its denbts , the russian army withdrew ( though the principalities remained protectorates ) and the annexation never occurred . 
  unlike most hypothetical scenarios , we actually know exactly how it would have turned out . 
  it 's called moldova ... 
  first of all , there 's a difference between segregation and identification . 
  for instance , in romania , people tend to identify pretty strongly with the [ historical region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/romania_historic_regions.svg/1958px-romania_historic_regions.svg.png ) they come from but i would n't say they segregate based on it . 
  gypsies definitely segregate , both voluntarily and not , though some do integrate into romanian society ( and usually identify as such when they do ) . 
  it 's a complex situation and describing it properly would be too long . 
  of other minorities , germans and hungarians from transylvania and banat tend to segregate to some extent , hungarians in particular . 
  in other regions , people of german and hungarian descent overwhelmingly consider themselves romanian . 
  it 's actually not that unusual ( though not extremely common either ) to meet people who have german last names but romanian first names and consider themselves romanian . 
  [ ion-gheorghe maurer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_gheorghe_maurer ) would be an ( in ) famous example . 
  as for smaller minorities , i 've only really met lipovans and tatars . 
  they do segregate to some extent for religious and cultural reasons , but they 're well integrated otherwise . 
  bucharest is close to both the [ mythical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snagov ) and [ probable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comana,_giurgiu ) burial places of vlad the impaler . 
  [ snagov monastery ] ( http://www.rolandia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/snagov-monastery4-1024x621.jpg ) is , actually , a little creepy . 
  never been to [ comana ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/manastirea_comana.jpg ) but it looks like the most stereotypical of all stereotypical monasteries for that part of the country . 
  [ lousy farmers ... ] ( https://youtu.be/quruzbsxyzy ), 
   i could have said the romanians ' , serbs ' and our battles against the turks first of all , i ca n't speak for serbs but i assure you romanians never felt `` the west '' betrayed them against the turks . 
  we were on our own , knew it , and did what we could ... 
  i do understand what you 're trying to say , i just think you 're wrong . 
  no one gave a shit when the german states lost a third of their population during the 30 years ' war , nor did anyone give a shit when france pretty much lost an entire generation during the napoleonic wars , etc. . . `` vae victis '' is the way war works . 
  do n't like it , remain neutral ... 
   did you help or not ? 
  i 'm curious , why do you feel that the west * should * have helped ? 
  hungary had been part of the central powers in ww1 and the axis in ww2 , why would the brits and french help their ennemies ? 
  and the other european countries did n't matter anyway . 
  i can understand czechs and poles when they talk about a `` western betrayal '' , but hungarians ( and romanians ) ... hell no . 
  we picked the wrong side and we got buttfucked . 
  that 's the way it works . 
  i 'd say the biggest thing that `` westerners '' ( european or not ) do n't understand is that there 's no such thing as `` eastern europe '' ( used in the typical sense of the term ) .
