  the czech republic , estonia and romania have about as much in common as austria , norway and portugal ...

  [ it 's pretty much our national drink . 
  area ? 
  though `` c\u0103t\u0103 '' makes me think `` transylvania '' . 
   brasov dialect sounds like `` southern light '' , although if i tell that to the locals they do n't like it lol , i bet they do n't . 
  that being said , i would prefer `` standard '' or `` muntenian '' rather than `` southern '' :d, 
  that 's very hard to answer since , until the mid-19th century , we only have written record from the nobility and clergy which always had a lot of contact with their counterparts in the other principalities . 
  i 'd say that , in the past , moldavia and wallachia probably formed a dialectal continuum . 
  it 's actually a popular joke that buzau and braila , the easternmost counties in wallachia , are in moldavia because ... well ... they speak that way ( a bit ) . 
  if you consider [ aromanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanian_language ) a dialect of romanian , then ... everything . 
  it 's pretty much a separate language with some degree of mutual intelligibility with romanian . 
  aside from that , a * very * thick moldavian accent can sometimes be hard to understand if you 're not used to it and oltenians are the only ones to use the perfect simple colloquially , but i would n't say either constitute radical differences . 
  what dick mine, 
  there 's a lot of contenders , but i 'll go with salata de vinete . 
  basically pureed roasted eggplants mixed with sunflower oil , salt and chopped onions . 
  eaten with bread . 
  some people also eat it with tomatoes , but they 're wrong . 
  worst , imo , would be [ mamaliga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c4%83m%c4%83lig%c4%83 ) . 
  not a huge fan of [ ciulama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciulama ) either , but i can at least make myself eat it ... 
  tastes a bit weird to me , actually . 
  internationally , i like camembert a lot . 
  nationally , `` ca\u015fcaval afumat '' or `` urd\u0103 dulce '' . 
  let 's be friends . 
  off-topic : holy shit , the moment with the bananas in the newspaper * literally * brought back a memory from childhood .

  i do n't like citrus . 
  fuck you , bro .

  my impression was the following : the accent in the republic of moldova is pretty much the same as that in romanian moldova but on steroids + some russian loanwords . 
  if you 're comfortable with dul\u015fi grai , you 'll understand people from the republic just fine . 
  that being said , while meat is very important in romanian cuisine , we do have quite a few vegetarian dishes since a lot of people still keep fasts . 
  they might even be vegan dishes , i 'm not really sure how fasting works . 
  what 's a vegetarian ? 
   measuring those things by volume is still very easy . 
  honestly , i 've always found it awkward and imprecise . 
  even for things for which volume * is * easy to measure . 
  i do it when absolutely necessary ( new recipes , etc. . . ) but , overall , i just use a kitchen scale and measure by weight . 
  lol . 
  romania : [ this is old as fuck but still pretty accurate/relevant ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ziwsvfvg2w ), 
   they kinda dug it up in the 19th century , like everyone else . 
  yes and no . 
  romanians , or at least the educated class among them , started identifying with latin europe at least as early as the 17th century when the moldavian chronicler grigore ureche stated that `` we came from rome '' ( de la rim ne tragem ) . 
  even before that , wallachia had some commercial and cultural ties to the italian city-states ( particularly genoa and venice ) which cemented this idea . 
  the secretary of petru cercel , who was genovese , wrote that the wallachian language was `` a corrupt form of latin . '', 
  there was however a dispute during the 19th century between the transylvanian school ( which saw romanians as an integral part of latin europe ) and moldavian and wallachian thinkers ( which saw romanians as more of a mix between latin , slavic and greek influences ) . 
   romania had replaced slavic words used not really , though it was tried . 
  the percentage of latin words in romanian has grown because we adopted a lot of new words in the 19th century ( indeed , mostly from french ) . 
  however , attempts to replace existing words mostly failed . 
  i do n't know anyone who uses `` nea '' instead of `` zapada '' for snow or `` arina '' instead of `` nisip '' for sand . 
  the oldest recorded text in romanian is from the early 16th century and , [ once transliterated from cyrilic , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac%c8%99u's_letter#transliteration_from_cyrillic ) it 's relatively readable so the language has n't changed * that * much . 
  yup , and `` oui '' comes from `` hoc ille '' via the medieval `` o\u00efl '' . 
  nothing is known clearly but , from the existence of historical minorities , we can guess that the [ principality of wallachia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachia ) : * encouraged the immigration of romanians ( or , more precisely , romance-speaking orthodox ) from moldavia and transylvania by granting tax exemptions ( moldavia and transylvania did the same ) * tolerated the immigration of non-muslims from the ottoman empire ( mostly bulgarians , some armenians , greeks and jews ) ( moldavia did the same , not sure about transylvania ) * tolerated the immigration of saxons ( or , more precisely , german-speaking catholics ) from transylvania in some areas ( campulung and targoviste in particular ) ( moldavia did the same ) * discouraged the immigration of muslims from the ottoman empire as a way to distance itself from it ( moldavia and transylvania did the same ) * gypsies were [ a special case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ), 
  your bread is sweet . 
  even the bread that supposedly is n't still is a bit . 
  it was n't a complete culture shock since i had lived in canada before that ( and their bread is also sweet ) , but i 've never managed to get used to it . 
   all religous groups and ethnicities were treated equal for most of its history [ uhh ... 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum )  what you did under the ceau-era is just blatantly outrageous , and it continues trust me , it sucked for everyone . 
  and i 'm not sure why you think the current situation is the same . 
   trust me , we do n't feel your understanding either . 
  i was talking about me personally . 
  we definitely have plenty of `` gb2 mongolia '' types . 
  you know , i understand transylvania 's historical significance for hungarians , but i wish more hungarians would understand its historical significance for romanians . 
  setting aside any pissing contest and politicized history , it is widely accepted that [ wallachia was founded by a noble from fagaras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachia#creation ) , [ moldavia by a noble from maramures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavia#high_middle_ages ) and that the first recorded romanian polities straddled both sides of the carpathians ( litovoi in gorj + hateg ) . 
  it is also a matter of historical record that wallachia kept the duchies of amlas and fagaras and moldavia those of maramures and , later , ciceu ( albeit under hungarian suzerainty ) until the late 15th century , and that wallachia maintained some fortresses in fagaras until the early 16th century . 
  in fact , this was the main reason wallachia managed to keep some degree of statality . 
  there were three attempts to turn it into an eyalet of which two - [ 1522 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radu_of_afuma%c8%9bi#reign ) and [ 1595 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_c%c4%83lug%c4%83reni#aftermath_of_the_battle ) - were repealed only due to the fact that wallachia could use transylvania as a safe base from which to launch a decisive counter-attack . 
  tl , dr : the region is central to both our country 's history , and i wish both sides would try to understand and respect that a bit more . 
  [ baked , yes . 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mcivcebqvu0/twa3jacyvli/aaaaaaaadao/_rdyin7dbe0/s1600/dscf2248.jpg ) otherwise , not really . 
  that article seems to conflate beauty standards ( i.e. 
  physical traits considered attractive ) with cultural norms ( such as scars or tattoos ) . 
  anyway , to answer op , having lived in both romania and the us i 'd say the only real difference is that men in the us tend to prefer curvier women while men in romania tend to prefer thinner women . 
  i 'm with team usa on this one , in case you 're curious . 
   they 'd probably say '' oooh , prostitutes and cheap labour '' lousy poles , going to italy to steal * our * jobs :(, 
  i agree with your general point but , just to nitpick , `` wallachia '' and `` wallachs '' ( or any variant thereof ) are n't used by romanians at all , it 's an exonym , so the situation is n't that similar . 
  a better analogy would be with moldova ( the country ) and moldova ( the region in romania ) . 
  and we do n't lose our shit about that either ( though we do call the country `` basarabia '' informally ) . 
  prussia yes , and austria too if it counts , but iirc the other german states were something of a mess .

   states with the same cultural heritage . 
  that 's not really possible . 
  it 's not unheard of , especially in mountainous areas , for a village to have a different dialect and traditions than the one next to it .
