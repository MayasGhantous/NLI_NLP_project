  furthermore , due to border changes , immigration and commerce , `` culture '' tends to be a smooth gradient whereas political borders are , by definition , binary and well-defined . 
   area you identify the most with glorious city-state of bucharest :p  ... and possesses the minimal requirements to be a sustainable state based on [ this map ... ] ( http://www.investliveromania.com/img%20map/romania-regions-map2.jpg ) i guess muntenia + dobrogea would be viable . 
  [ there are some in southern ukraine and south-eastern romania as well . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipovans ) my grandmother came from a village that was originally lipovan ( but is now mostly romanian ) . 
  they are generally well integrated but there has been some friction , especially during the early years of communism , though not so much on religious grounds . 
  there are still some so-so stereotypes about them , mostly related to drinking , but you 'd have a hard time finding any group in romania about which there are n't some so-so stereotypes . 
  some of the lipovans are actually descendants of [ skoptsy .

  if transylvania is rightful romanian clay , then budjak and northern bukovina are rightful ukrainian clay ... hertza being in ukraine is still bullshit though . 
  if we stretch the definition of `` region '' a bit : * muntenia + oltenia + dobrogea = ~ 8.5 million people * bulgaria = 7.2 million people so really , * we * would be annexing * them * :d, 
  [ here 's a map . 
  ] ( http://bestofromania.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/village-romanian-traditional-houses.jpg ) the standard romanian village house looks [ like this . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kgfrk6go5ie/uwjrs5cacii/aaaaaaaakk4/pnym7fvqn9u/s1600/gospodarie-atelier+pentru+prelucrarea+parului+de+capra+din+musculesti-petresti%252c+judetul+gorj.-+muzeul+astra-++-+proiect+casa+arhitectura+traditionala+romaneasca+taraneasca.jpg ) there are regional differences in building materials and roof angles , but these are mostly variations on the same theme . 
  this style is particularly prevalent in moldavia ( ne of the country ) , but it 's dominant throughout romania . 
  a [ noticeable variation on this ] ( http://www.agerpres.ro/imageresize?path=%2fmedia%2fimages%2f2014-08%2f08071022-156728387.jpg&amp;size=6 ) is found in dobrogea and baragan ( se of the country ) , houses being lower , longer and often whitewashed in two different colours for the walls and frames ( usually white and blue ) , which ( imo ) looks lovely . 
  another [ noticeable variation ] ( http://mariuscruceru.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/golaesti-muzeul-satului.jpg ) is raised by a level ( or half-level ) to protect against flooding , with the ground floor being sturdier and containing a cellar . 
  you can find them in various regions but they 're typical for muntenia ( south-central ) . 
  culas , [ fortified tower-houses , ] ( https://www.voceavalcii.ro/media/k2/items/cache/185057c39962b9ace310c88446bcc4c7_xl.jpg ) were built by landowners in times of instability during the 18th and 19th centuries . 
  they are almost exclusive to oltenia ( sw region ) . 
  in banat and southern transylvania ( western and central ) , a lot of [ houses have german influence , ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2012/03/18/50a8484f7c42d5a6636c71dd/646x404.jpg ) the half-gabled roof being distinctive . 
  they often have enclosed courtyards and high foundations and windows to protect against flooding . 
  finally , specifically in banat ( western region ) , which was extensively colonized in the 18th and 19th centuries , you can see a lot of [ houses that are more adorned , ] ( http://www.banaterra.eu/romana/files/images/banat_casa_sarbeasca.preview.jpg ) and with a stronger austro-hungarian influence . 
  church architecture is also very , very different from one region to the other but this post is long enough as it is .

  honestly , a lot of romanians barely even know we were in the axis ... and even fewer know that we took an active part in the holocaust . 
  for those who do know , the attitude can be summarized as follows :  [ it was bad with `` der , die , das '' ... 
  but it was worse with `` davai ceas ^ ^ ^ \\ ( wristwatch \\ ) '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantin_t%c4%83nase#death ) this is further complicated by the fact that romania * had * tried to remain neutral in ww2 , going so far as to relinquish three fourths of its territorial gains from ww1 , and was facing the very real possibility of dismemberment if it * did n't * pick a side ... as such , a fair amount of people saw ( and still see ) antonescu as a patriot , if a misguided one , and some even as a hero . 
  by and large , the prevailing attitude was that we were stuck between two bad options and picked one . 
  few people are uncomfortable with it . 
  and that the past is the past . 
  most people do n't care . 
  reminds of a joke i once heard : `` crime is really becoming a problem . 
  even in monaco , billionaires are afraid to leave their homes ... there 's millionaires on the prowl . '', 
   velvet revolution was more or less organised by communists in order to not end like the comrades in romania and maintain their positions in a new regime . 
  amusingly enough , one of the theories about the romanian revolution is that it was essentially a disguised coup d'etat . 
  the guy who came to power afterwards , [ iliescu , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu ) was just as much a communist as ceausescu had been ( in fact , there are allegations that he was a kgb agent ) . 
  coincidentally , he founded the party that won the recent parliamentary elections and is still its honorary president ... 
  when giving flowers , you 're supposed to give an odd number of them . 
  unless it 's for a funeral . 
  or is it the other way around ?

  this suggests that we had a choice in the matter . 
  which we did n't . 
  ivan and johann had a fight , ivan won , ivan re-drew the map as he pleased . 
  fair enough , but ion was by and large just caught in the middle ( as was istvan ) . 
  that being said , if the people of moldova * and * romania want it , the two could unite . 
  if not , no . 
  and moldovans mostly say no ... 
  [ republica macedonia . 
  ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/republica_macedonia ) `` macedonia '' alone usually refers to the historical region ^ ^ ^ ^ \\ ( which ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ mostly ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ greece ) . 
  nationality can happen too , actually , but not so much in europe . 
  i 'm romanian but have a slavic-sounding name and a pale/rosy complexion ( and a noticeable accent , so obviously foreign ) so , in the us , i get russian or ukrainian a lot . 
  there was a funny moment recently . 
  i met an ukrainian girl in a bar and , after i told her my name , she started talking to me in russian ( i think ) . 
  funniest part was that she knew a little romanian too ( she was from chernivtsi/cernauti ) .

  i was talking more from a historical perspective ( except the bit about bucharest being pretty different from the rest of muntenia ... which is really just obvious ) . 
  in terms of cultural differences , you could balkanize any region of romania * ad infinitum * ... to give another example from the one you gave , someone from the northern parts of arges or prahova counties might feel culturally closer to brasov than to calarasi ( source : i have family there ) . 
  i would argue for a three - or four-way split , personally . 
  [ based on this  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/romania_historic_regions.svg/2000px-romania_historic_regions.svg.png ) * muntenia + oltenia ( principality of wallachia ) * moldova + bucovina ( principality of moldavia ) * transylvania + banat + crisana + maramures ( austro-hungarian lands ) * dobrogea is hard to place , could be seen as more connected to wallachia or as its own thing and , frankly , bucharest tends to be quite distinct from the rest of muntenia . 
  afaik , \u015ferb was used in transylvania ( which did not have institutional slavery , at least not since the 18th century ) whereas cl\u0103ca\u0219 was used in moldavia and wallachia ( which did ) . 
   how comparable this is to black slavery in the u.s. 
  relatively comparable , with the caveat that moldavia and wallachia still practiced serfdom at the time and that a serf ( cl\u0103ca\u0219 in romanian ) would have less freedom , * de facto * , than certain categories of gypsy slaves ( though the slaves did have a worse position * de jure * ) . 
  aside from which , gypsies were n't slaves in bulgaria , hungary , serbia or slovakia ( or not recently , in any case ) but i do n't think bulgarians , hungarians , serbs or slovaks are any fonder of them ... 
  well , the oldest surviving romanian ( and moldovan ) chronicle states \u201e de la r\u00eem ne tragem '' ( we descend from rome ) ... 
   ivan takes moldova and merges it into the moldovan ssr , leaves dobruja to the bulgarians , transylvania to the hungarians and wallachia becomes a puppet rump state . 
  this is almost certainly what would have happened during the war , but i 'm not sure about afterwards . 
  for all their faults , the russians were generally in favour of ethnic self-determination so bulgaria had no chance of holding on to northern dobrogea or hungary to most of transilvania . 
  i 'm pretty sure the allies would have won anyway so , in case of a partition , i 'd lean more towards a socialist republic of transylvania ( the russians actually toyed with this idea for awhile ) and twin soviet republics of moldavia and wallachia with dobrogea split between them . 
  edit : that being said , i think the most likely outcome would n't have been a partition but rather a different status within the warsaw pact , more `` tochitura communism '' than `` unofficial soviet republic '' . 
  there was an article with the [ recollections with a cabinet minister from the time of the ultimatum . 
  ] ( http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/constantin-argetoianu-ultimatum-mi-s-au-t-iat-picioarele ) ( article in romanian , sorry ) when moscow demanded bessarabia and bukovina , the romanian government contacted the western powers to see if any would support us against the russians but all said they were willing to consider the annexation as temporary but not to provide actual aid . 
  against this backdrop , a meeting of the ministers was called to determine whether we should accept the ultimatum or unilaterally go to war against russia . 
  the council decided that any attempt to fight would result in a massacre and leave us defenceless , so we were better off retreating until we could secure some allies . 
  it 's interesting to think just how different our history might have been if that one decision had been different ... a principled ( if hopeless ) stand would have averted our entry in the war on the part of the axis , allowed us to argue that we were a neutral country caught up in our neighbours ' bloodthirst and left us in a better diplomatic position after the war . 
  at the same time , we had absolutely no chances of fighting off the russian army while hungary ( which demanded all of transylvania ) and bulgaria ( which demanded all of dobruja ) would no doubt have taken advantage of it ... and i 'm not sure ivanushka would have stopped his tank at the prut either . 
  who knows what might have happened ... 
  i 'm vaguely butthurt about 1410-1989 , but for specific events : mad at others : [ russia 's annexation of budjak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_san_stefano#montenegro.2c_serbia.2c_and_romania ) there is just something so ridiculously insulting and , frankly , a little evil about annexing territory from an ally at the outcome of a war where they provided diplomatic , logistic and military support ... 
  it also indirectly caused an unnecessary conflict with bulgaria and deepened the economic disparity between the regions of muntenia and moldavia ( for the record , i 'm from muntenia but would have preferred a more even development of the country ) . 
  mad at us : [ slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania ) it resulted in chronic dysfunctionality that goes far beyond `` oh noes , we has gypsies . '',
