  to give just one example , noblemen were responsible for local administration but , since their income was mostly drawn from their estates and independent of the situation of the peasants , they had very little incentive to properly collect taxes or enforce laws which caused chronic lack of funds in the central treasuries and inability to develop infrastructure . 
  well , if you have this :  killed in the stalls by a professional you do n't have this :  intoxication from improperly killed pigs intoxications ( and trikinelosis ) happen when the blood is n't properly drained from the pig . 
  theoretically you 're supposed to hire a professional butcher to kill the pig , but traditionally the head of the household ( who might not have any idea what he 's doing ) would do it . 
  [ koline does seem similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig_slaughter#european_tradition ) , the dinner is traditional here too . 
  traditionally , on st.ignatius ( end of december , not sure of the date ) , you 're supposed to slaughter and butcher a pig at home . 
  every year , a couple of hillbillies get intoxication from improperly killed pigs . 
  [ for the stout-hearted , here 's a video of it featuring cristi .

  i think pipera is now part of voluntari , actually ( not sure though ) ... 
  north * west * bucharest ( and parts of downtown ) . 
  northeast bucharest ( represent ! ), 
  is ... not that wealthy . 
  yeah , it 's a recipe we have in common  [ pasc\u0103 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paska_ ( bread \\ ) #pasc . c4 .83 ) is more traditional for easter over here , though . 
   pi\u0161koti til where pi\u0219cot comes from . 
  it 's not specifically for christmas but [ cozonac . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=cozonac&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi3x7eu9dxqahujbsykhvgja_oq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638 ) it 's a puffy-ish sweet bread with various fillings . 
  chocolate , poppy seeds , raisins , walnuts , turkish delight and sweet cheese are the most common . 
  i * think * , but do n't quote me on this , that the filling is supposed to be different based on the holiday it 's made for . 
  i know i mostly ate walnut cozonac at christmas . 
  honestly , london felt closer to paris , in terms of atmosphere and general look , than to any nordic city ... or even amsterdam . 
  you 're definitely not southern , but you 're not northern either . 
  apparently , you 're [ not even gentically northern . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gll0m9y.png ) i think `` western '' is a good way to put it . 
   growing up here , i get the feeling that romanian society is n't racist i 'm going to be honest , i used to think the same way until i lived outside romania for awhile . 
  would you be so kind as to translate for the westerners the saying `` cum r\u0103chita nu e pom , nici \u021biganul nu e om . '', 
  it 's the only easily explainable one , but there 's a lot of other little things . 
  in practice , even during summer - and bucharest often gets 40c in summer ... we get a lot of sun - most gypsies still tend to be noticeable . 
  but yes , many gypsies can pass for darker romanians if they act , dress and talk like romanians . 
   how does gypsy look different from romanians ? 
  not sure if serious but , in case you are , [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/6843077_700b.jpg ) there are some [ very dark romanians , ] ( https://scoutingromania.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/victor-piturca.jpg ) as well as some [ very light gypsies , ] ( http://www.business-review.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/udrea.jpg ) but those are the exceptions to the rule . 
  i never thought about it like this , but ... actually , yes ... though only in one very specific case . 
  ethnic romanians can be any [ shade ] ( http://assets.sport.ro/assets/procinema/2005/10/18/image_galleries/2455/-37_23.jpg ) of [ white , ] ( http://a1.ro/uploads/modules/news/0/2015/9/17/411789/144248793361249526.jpg ) or even [ vaguely asian , ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2016/03/02/56d6e5ea5ab6550cb868aa34/646x404.jpg ) without being considered anything other than romanian . 
  however , ethnic romanians who look gypsy , and [ there are some , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldxnabs.jpg ) are often tacitly ( or sometimes openly ) assumed to be gypsies . 
  well ... my country has [ deep historical ties with armenia , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenians_of_romania ) and [ some with georgia as well . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthim_the_iberian ) they are christian countries , culturally and historically connected to the byzantine empire and the black sea commercial zone ... 
  i think of them as european . 
  i would n't say the same for azerbaijan , to be honest . 
  [ relevant ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/uyywafy05-u?t=35s ), 
  not specifically about romania but about its predecessor states of moldavia and wallachia . 
  between 1829 and 1834 they were , simultaneously : * ottoman vassals ... * ... and russian protectorates ... * ... autonomous ... * ... but ruled by a russian governor ... * ... and two countries ... * ... but had the same government and constitution ... * ... and their joint capital ( bucharest ) had a significant minority of austrian citizens this is the stuff polandball comics are made of . 
  not quite , but overall i 'd go with [ these guys . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufses9ov2py ), 
  i spent my late teens in canada and my adult life split between canada , romania and the us ( and , very briefly , spain ) ... so yes , quite a few in fact . 
   cultural differences it 's hard to answer this question . 
  i doubt anyone has dated a statistically significant sample of people from * any * country - theirs or others - so it depends more on the person than the country . 
  overall , i 'd say latin american girls are definitely more `` fiery '' ( if you know what i mean ) than average , asian girls often give off subtly different social cues than what i 'm used to ( which can make things a bit difficult in relationships ) and german girls have a different sense of , and view of , humour than i 'm used to . 
   funny situations not exactly funny , but ... 
  i was for awhile with a mexican girl who was , physically , very [ maya looking . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maya_peoples ) to be less pc , she [ looked vaguely gypsy . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maya_peoples#/media/file:chichicastenango-004.jpg ) it was a bit of a mind-fuck , to be honest . 
  definitely made me realize that i * do * have some racist prejudices that i did n't think i had ... 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ro&amp;u=http://www.amintiridinepocadeaur.ro/raw/141&amp;prev=search ), 
  i have a ton of them , but here 's three : * a non-negligible percentage of romanians - including some very , very white ones - would find a gypsy in their family tree if they went back far enough * corruption , cronyism and theft have been very significant problems in romania since long before communism ( though communism did n't help either ) * some of the phanariotes were more civilized , competent and enlightened , by far , than most of the voivodes we 've ever had and a somewhat less unpopular one : * the absolute best thing that could have ever happened to us would have been if austria had annexed all three principalities instead of just transylvania, 
  depends by which [ administrative division ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuts_statistical_regions_of_romania ) you go . 
  nuts1 ( macroregions ) , yes . 
  nuts2 ( development regions ) ... technically speaking yes , but i was three years old the one and only time i 've been to the nw region and remember nothing . 
  nuts3 ( counties ) , not even close . 
  i doubt too many people have . 
  at least the gypsy stereotype has * some * truth to it , we do have a lot of them . 
  what i find stranger is that you often hear the stereotype that romania is one of the poorest/least developed countries in the region even though it 's [ literally the opposite ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:rom:bgr:hun&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rom:bgr:hun:mda:srb:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) ( which says more about the region than about romania , to be honest ) . 
   mongol about my ethnicity [ heh heh heh ... ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/history/2015/08/18/turkey-hungary-jointly-commemorate-atilla-the-hun ), 
  tfw that looks like a pretty average neighbourhood in bucharest ... to answer op 's question , there are no `` no-go zones '' in romania , but if you 're in , say , [ aleea livezilor ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@44.3896946,26.0775996,3a,75y,193.88h,87.06t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s_qsqvzxxcrq3yjiowimwiq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo3.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d_qsqvzxxcrq3yjiowimwiq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d157.00659%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656 ) and call for the police , they might take awhile to show up ... 
  never been that far north-west , to be honest . 
  i 'm not knowledgeable , it 's just subjective impressions from having traveled a bit in the area ( and having relatives from campulung-muscel ) . 
  olt actually used to be two counties : olt and romanati . 
  historically , oltenia is west of the olt and muntenia east of it . 
  linguistically though , oltenian regionalisms appear about halfway through arges and teleorman counties but do n't become too noticeable until dolj and gorj just as `` dul\u0219i grai '' starts in buzau but does n't become hardcore until you reach vaslui . 
  it also works for the other end of muntenia , people from pitesti do n't like being called olteni ( those from slatina are semi-okay with it though ) . 
  as for campulung , they do n't even like being called argeseni , let alone olteni . 
  the only one that 's really mainstream is that some internet comedians like to pretend that br\u0103ila and buz\u0103u counties are n't in moldova . 
  aside from that , not getting involved man ... 
  no , communism did not fall from the sky . 
  you could even go a little further and claim that , during the late 40s and 50s , we were for all practical purposes the 16th soviet republic : the ussr controlled all our industries - and 80-90 % of our foreign trade - via sovroms , counties were abolished and replaced with raions , soviet troops were stationed permanently in romania , the russian language was mandatory and heavily promoted , etc. . . 
  but , already in the 60s , we started distancing ourselves from moscow and , by the 70s and 80s , had severed most of our ties . 
  the ussr still had plenty of influence in the country , no doubt about it , but most of the dumbfuckery that went on in the country was not caused by them in any way . 
  i know this is n't a popular view , but much of it * was * our own fault . 
  communism left a [ clear mark on romania , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systematization_ ( romania \\ ) ) but we ca n't really blame the ussr for it . 
  speaking specifically of what the ussr left behind ... the [ apartment buildings built in the 50s and 60s , ] ( https://voiebuna.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/picture281.jpg?w=812 ) [ wall rugs , ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=carpeta+perete&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj4_kzy79dpahxget4khubndo4q_auiccgb ) and i think it 's during that time that [ vodka ] ( http://www.drinkinginamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/scandic-pop-e1360253496661.jpg ) became popular in romania . 
  i mostly drink loose-leaf tea from a local store . 
  favourite , by far , is assam but i can appreciate ceylon or kenyan too . 
  if i can only find bagged tea , twinings . 
  thick , viscous , sugary fruit syrup that you mix with water to make a sort of juice . 
  i think it 's also used for cooking , but i 'm not sure . 
  disclaimer : i 've been ex-pat for awhile  peanut butter you can find it in supermarkets , but it 's really not popular . 
  i do n't like it , personally . 
   jam/jelly/preserves a lot of people make their own , but yes , very popular . 
  jelly not so much , but definitely jams and pickled vegetables . 
   ready to eat meals not really , but you can buy ready-made ( or partially-made ) dishes that are a pain in the ass to make at home ( mici , zacusca , salata de icre , etc. . . )  common breakfast items i grew up on bread with medium-boiled eggs and chocolate milk . 
  sometimes yogurt or cheese too . 
   cereals easy to find in supermarkets . 
  some people appreciate the convenience , some do n't like them . 
   common beverages assuming you mean non-alcoholic , then mineral water and , to a lesser extent , fruit syrups . 
   common condiments salt , pepper and a ton of green stuff that i do n't really know since i 'm not that good a cook ( parsley , oregano , whatever leustean is , etc. . . ) some ready-made seasonings , like vegeta , delikat or maggi , are also pretty popular . 
   when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch no one makes pasta from scratch , but most people make their own tomato sauce ( based on ready-made bulion ) . 
  to be honest , though , pasta with sauce is n't that popular . 
  i 'm more used to pasta being incorporated in soups or baked with cheese and butter . 
   common alcoholic beverages ? 
  anything , lol .
