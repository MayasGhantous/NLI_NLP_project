oh look , the negative product placement style media bashing and ukip disinformation campaigns worked !, 
  time to start our own i guess ... 
  here 's our opinion of a yougov user . 
  ireland, 
  moldova ... our northern ireland, 
  why do you have to bribe , are those illegal in bulgaria ? 
  take it from someone who has lived in it since birth . 
  corruption thrives off the obscurity of those who perpetrate it . 
  the greater the impact , the more universal the consequences , the more difficult corruption becomes . 
  2004 was too soon for romania 's accession to the eu , which is why we joined in 2007 . 
  everything negative you see about romania is engineered by russian eurosceptic money . 
  study the recent sky news episode and many things will come in to light . 
  they only show the inelegant aspects of romanian life , and have systematically eroded romania 's national image trough miserable editorials , documentaries and general news casting formulating attitude and implanting opinion . 
  part of this has to do with undermining moldova 's desire to reunite with romania , and a foreign press slander attack coupled with a pro russian internal campaign featuring slogans such as , `` we do n't want a union with gipsy '' plus online trolling factories signposting , are the forefront of our struggle to reunite with what is as much a part of romania , as bavaria is of germany . 
  we are also presented as a landfill populated by gipsy , for investment deterrence , which helps keep jobs west and makes us less pro-european project oriented , if we see less reward for our participation . 
  the reason you see this in the media is mostly to do with a cohesive european strategy to allow the russian eurosceptic program to spend itself out of balance , forcing the kremlin to waste money they do n't have . 
  however , after the brexit vote , european populist stupidity was underestimated it seems . 
  hiring gipsy to camp in public parks in london , was enough to make british voters think of the eu as a diseased project , infecting the uk with unsustainable and miserable poverty zombies , something that could only be avoided by voting to separate . 
  romania is far better and has far more potential than every other east european country , maybe just shy of poland ... 
  during communism they had to chain gipsy kids to the school desks to keep them in school , because the gipsy learned to survive by sending the kids to do the dirty work , seeing as how we do n't put kids in jail . 
  they would beat them unconscious for hanging around school all day instead of going around stealing or begging to come home with something . 
  they force kids to defecate outside on the ground and compare the faecal matter with that the other family members because they all eat the same thing and if the quantity , odour , colour or consistency was different then that of the others , the father would assume that child spent some of the money he made begging , on something he ate by himself . 
  the punishment for this transgression was always having to eat not only your own shit , but everybody else 's as well , all this while everybody was watching . 
  stop inflating yourself with the illusion that you know shit about shit . 
  it 's impossible to dictate lifestyle parameters or impose behaviour on a different ethnicity , without being a nazi . 
  integrating gipsy , means taking away their kids . 
  there was a time when you could get away with that ... but we have been neutered by the european union since the early 90s . 
  they came in an said that all ethnic minorities in the eu , are to be guaranteed `` inalienable cultural freedoms '' which apparently include child marriages where they put an 9yo girl and an 11yo boy in a room an force them to have sex , only so they can ceremoniously yank the bed sheet out from under them and drape it off a balcony , showcasing two stains , one of red blood proving the 9yo girl was a virgin and another stain of supposed semen proving the 11yo boy is virile . 
  integration means destroying their culture an domesticating them in accordance with our own social values . 
  we are much to tolerant to ever do something like that , and it ca n't be done nowadays because we have a different outlook on `` diversity '' . 
  they might be 3.3 % but they are presented by all european media conglomerates , as 96.7 % of the romanian population in a very sneaky covert subtext format where they never say rroma from romania , just `` romanians '' . 
  this is how we 've come to a reality , where a white romanian presents himself as romanian , only to be told , `` you do n't look romanian '' . 
  there are obvious cultural particularities ... they make up ethnic identities . 
  thinking a nomadic people would want to settle down and integrate , is asinine . 
   it 's not all about gypsies not wanting to integrate . 
  it 's also about romanians not wanting to integrate them . 
  ignorance is bliss , or so i 've heard . 
  about 8 years ago i saw a news documentary about a man who tried to help a gipsy father of 4 , who had as his only source of income , the scrap metal foraging that got him about as much as to buy a loaf of bread and 10 eggs , to feed 5 mouths . 
  the owner of the metal recycling centre , took pity on him and offered him a job as the reception agent , a job that paid more than enough for him and his kids to live comfortably . 
  he promptly refused the offer , arguing that if he took the job , he could n't be out there looking for scrap , and that meant all he 'd ever have is a full stomach , whereas if he were to be going around looking for scrap metal , maybe he 'd stumble across `` a million euros worth of rail road track in an overgrown ditch , forgot there by the communists . '', 
  he also presented not having to wakeup on schedule and answer to somebody as a freedom worth going hungry for , every now and again . 
  try and convince somebody , who thinks in these adventurous terms , to integrate in the banality we call normal life . 
  why are black americans referred to as `` african-americans `` and our gipsy are always `` romanians '' . 
  should we start pushing the term `` south-asian-romanians '' to distinguish ourselves from the inelegant lifestyle of this minority and spare ourselves the damage done to our national identity ? 
  what if some of these syrians start fucking kids as manifestation of their subculture , and foreign press outlets start coming to germany to make documentaries about how the germans are all paedophiles , and every german shown on tv would be a brown skinned buffoon ? 
  would you want to draw lines in this sand , or would you just sit there as your economy goes to shit , because people 's perception would be that , they wo n't want to buy a bmw or volkswagen that was assembled together by fingers which were in sole kid 's asshole earlier that day . 
  ** fucking with national images has consequentness !, 
  ** it 's not racist to try and differentiate yourself !, 
  they 're germans just like all the austrians are germans . 
  language identity + genetic heritage thumps geopolitically awarded citizenship . 
  i 'm thinking it 's these new hdr cameras . 
  either that or global warming . 
   saying that gypsies who have lived in romania for decades or were even born in your country are not romanian is just you being racist . 
  simple as that . 
  the vast majority of rroma from transilvania , only speak hungarian and their own gipsy language , going back generations . 
  are they romanians ? 
  i 'm not trying to be an asshole or anything , but most of the gipsy we have now , are the descendants of those that hid here when the nazi were trying out new soap recipes . 
  they got trapped by the iron curtain for 50 years , but that does n't make them romanians in the slightest , they are very much a ** european ** minority , and everybody needs to start embracing them as a force of nature , indigenous to the european social climate , and by no means a romanian disease , communicable trough freedom of movement . 
  ** our only fault in this is being so tolerant , to the point of appearing indifferent . 
  you do n't find it the least bit curious that nato has 5 germany has 5 and we need 6 ? 
  is it just me , or are our gipsy getting darker ? 
  [ we 're among the least leveraged in eu ] ( http://blog.thomsonreuters.com/index.php/european-government-debt-graphic-of-the-day/ ), 
  italy has 15 , germany has 4 * france has 5 , the uk wo n't say how many they have , but all these seem to be used in foreign theaters around the middle east and northern africa , then there are 5 nato drones collectively owned by bulgaria , czech republic , denmark , estonia , germany , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , norway , poland , romania , slovak republic , slovenia , america and i still do n't get why we need 6 . 
  we do n't really have anything going on anywhere as far as military involvement goes . 
  so what then ? 
  they need more than all of nato has in europe just for romania ? 
  wtf do they plan on doing here with 6 drones ? 
  apart from the uk , does any other european country have drones ? 
  i know latvia has two , on loan from the us and operated by us forces , we have two of those as well . 
  i 'm trying to figure out whether or not this is just the new normal or if maybe things are escalating here to where we need drones now . 
  ** pros : ** exterminating the rat nest national governments and taking power away from the human garbage currently filling the influence trafficking and embezzlement political landfills mascaraing as `` capitals '' . 
  ** cons : ** having to have arguments with morons who do n't understand there are n't any . 
  ** n ** ot in ** e ** mployment , ** e ** ducation or ** t ** raining . 
  ### latin !, 
  you know ... like the other 4 latin countries . 
  romania , ** italy ** , spain , france , portugal . 
  they plan on playing it just like this until the next general election in 2020 . 
  but i do n't see this uncertainty `` twilight zone '' with a crippled pound , helping anyone . 
  you do realise you have to take the kid home for a while , and then bring him back if you `` reject '' him/her . 
  you do n't get to reject a glossier with photos and medical records and iq tests , you have to spend time with the kids themselves . 
  you 'd have to be a sociopath and on beta blockers , to look some 3yo in the eyes , seeing him happy to be in an actual house for the first time in his life , an then tell him he 's skin is too brown an that you 're taking him back to the orphanage , because you 're hoping for a whiter kid . 
  i honestly ca n't imagine what kind of person you 'd have to be , to be able to do that 5 times . 
  the brexit bruised eu businesses have yet to retaliate against the uk economy , mostly because the want to slowly pull everything out undamaged , but that axe is undoubtedly coming down and coming down hard . 
  when the pound lost 12 % of it 's value , all foreign investors in uk assets , lost 12 % of their money . 
  the only reason it 's not worse it 's because everybody stopped cold when cameron resigned without filing art. 50 , giving everyone hope for a miracle switchereu , where they stay or bite their lip and agree to free movement and a norway deal that effectively equates staying , meaning the pound goes back and they do n't eat 12 % brexiter shit for lunch . 
  this is likely a `` mall run '' like the russians had when the rouble went to shit . 
  people cleared the store shelves because the pound dropped 12 % and that meant the next stocking of imports would be a minimum of 12 % more expensive . 
  and here we are , both of us vehemently insisting we 're ** not ** balkan ... , 
  just so we-re clear , this is not some social injustice being made right by the romanian social services . 
  it is in actual fact , just another obstacle purposely put in place so as to enhance the contextual relevancy of social workers in adoption administration and secure yet another reason why they have to be bribed . 
  we have an enormous problem with institutions lobbing for custom tailored laws that make public services almost impossible to deal with , effectively creating a public administration system where no one has any chance of solving a problem or moving forward in life , without having to bribe someone to circumvent laws that limit your rights in a way which obfuscates access to social services and turns all public administration offices , in to a legally ornate for-profit extortion boutique , where people come up with a kilogram of papers to a bolshevik service window where a cunty old woman looks at you like you 're a piece of shit and throws you back your papers saying there 's nothing she can do , blaming another institution with yet another bolshevik service window where some other rancid cunt tells you the same thing . 
  this was all woven in at the `` request '' of the nomenclature profiting from the budget set aside for social services . 
  now they can extort thousands of euro from every couple wishing to adopt , and punish those who have the audacity to walk in to that office without a fat envelope , by using the rroma kids as a threat leverage . 
   ** romanian authorities say families who want to adopt a child will no longer be able to make a choice based on the child 's ethnicity . 
  **  gabriela coman , head of the national authority for the protection of the rights of the child and adoption , presented a new adoption law wednesday . 
  she said ethnicity has been eliminated as a criteria for adoption . 
   some romanians do n't want to adopt a roma child . 
  coman also said prospective adopters are allowed to refuse a maximum of five children . 
   a new adoption law came into effect aug. 12 , aiming to speed up the adoption process from the current average of 18 months to less than a year . 
   around 57,500 children are in state care .
