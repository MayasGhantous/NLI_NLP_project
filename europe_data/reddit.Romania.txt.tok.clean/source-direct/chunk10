  i want to be a european citizen in the true sense . 
  i want a european army , central intelligence , central bank , single currency , border agency , ** and a single european police authority !, 
  ** i want to see a vicious european anti-corruption agency and a european prison for civil representatives found guilty . 
  nationality is for football teams and history books , i want regional municipal or county powers under a federal umbrella . 
  the current eu is not a union of european people , it 's a union of european politicians . 
  it means shit to us !, 
  we want to be united as a community of individuals , the purpose of which is collaboration toward our one true goal , ** contributing to the advancement of human society and the emancipation of all europeans to a fulfilling and meaningful life !, 
  the internet is a series of tubes , that never forget !, 
  the founder of the hungarian euroskeptic party `` jobbik '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b\u00e9la_kov\u00e1cs_ ( politician , _ 1960 )  the hungarian government has accused kov\u00e1cs of spying for the russian government against european union institutions . 
  in september 2014 , the hungarian public prosecutor asked the european parliament to suspend kov\u00e1cs 's mep immunity so that he could be investigated . 
  [ 1 ] the european parliament lifted the immunity on october 14 , 2015 . 
  [ 2 ] b\u00e9la kov\u00e1cs 's russian father served in the military and his son has been ` known to the kgb almost from the day he was born . 
   the vast majority of economic migrants in the uk are from the commonwealth . 
  9 out of 12 million to be exact . 
  only 2 million are from the eu , the largest group being poland with 800.000 and then about another 300.000 from other eastern countries like romania with approx 122.000 . 
  and then there are about another million italians , spanish , portuguese , greeks from souther europe . 
  the leave campaign was a textbook radicalization exercise , where they were antagonised trough misplaced aggression to think their eu is responsible for everything that 's wrong in their country . 
  it will be a few interesting months for the intelligence community , that 's for sure . 
  he means dacia superiore .

  relax ... do n't react emotionally these things , they 're all very likely put together by the kremlin to get us all to bring the hate and amplify the brexit effect , which almost everyone in the uk regrets just days after . 
  i would n't be surprised if these xenophobic idiocies bloom all over the eu , mostly the countries where the sceptic movement has been financed by the kgb recently . 
  ( hungary , france , sweden etc. ), 
  even that whole thing about the laminated `` polish vermin '' cards sounds like it 's 1000 % communist propagandist soviet guerilla tactics . 
  they 're literally starving over there because of the eu sanctions , so this is just the time for them to hit us , when we 're down . 
  stay vigilant , do n't succumb to the creative false flag attitude implantation and opinion fabrication nonsense , that you 're surly to be bombarded with in the next few months wherever you are in europe . 
  relatively they actually wo n't . 
  the access to the property latter stays the same because prices drop because there 's less money around , and that means less customers . 
  the amount of money you pay for housing , relative to income is about to increase and therefore your quality of life will be adversely affected . 
  there are already reports of almost 100 % mortgage application ** rejection ** uk wide . 
  so without job stability banks wo n't lend sending rentals in high demand . 
  what do you think about romania so far ? 
  you should make a text post about your move here . 
  their plan is to collapse the current government by resigning , and force general elections in which they will campaign by promising a majority would bring the instatement of a pro-european prime minister , who 's first act in office , is to be , the invalidation of this referendum from a position of obvious popular support . 
  then they 'll do away with this nonsense and go about saying that this referendum was actually about lack of involvement by the political class in those `` disenfranchised areas '' , and that they got the message and promise to bring about `` change '' from a strong position in a `` reformed european union '' which has now been awaken to the `` local problems '' . 
  the eu has caught up to their bullshit the nanosecond cameron stepped out in front of nr .10 friday morning and fell on his knife only to have an excuse to call in sick for 3 months . 
  that 's why juncker keeps fucking with them to expedite this , he 's trying to rub their nose in shit . 
  maybe their being antisocial to this degree , might have to do with many of them from around poor areas of the uk , being victims of institutional paedophilia . 
  the level of child abuse in those areas was truly frightening in the last 5 decades , and might also be the reason why they failed to succeed in life , to even beneath the point where they feel envious of the immigrant population . 
   what relationship the eu and the uk will establish do n't put your hopes in that basket . 
  the deal with the eu could be whatever you dream it to be , but that still wo n't change the fact that you gathered your toys and left , because you think you 're better than the rest of us . 
  something likely to manifest itself in a spiteful boycott towards british products , by the eu citizens themselves , as customers . 
  brussels can give you a deal that includes passionate oral sex from all eu commissioners , no amount of access to this market can undo the damage you 've done by offending nearly everybody in the other 27 , with rampant xenophobia , not to mention antagonising and encouraging the euroskeptic morons in other countries , hoping to drag somebody else with you . 
  i honestly do n't see how you can come back from this , but there are ways to undo or at least indefinitely postpone this nonsense by never activating art. 50 . 
  having said that , i 'd rather scotland stay and invalidate the referendum rather than dig this hole even deeper and have a premature one themselves . 
  edit : re-phrased . 
  the freedom of movement might still be there but immigration will surely stop , because the economy will contract severely . 
  so not only will immigration stop , it will morph in to mass emigration by both native brits and eu migrants . 
  the real spectacle to watch out for , will start when those millions of immigrants who are only there to make money , will start to leave those houses where they live in bunk beds , 10 to a house , paying # 10 a day and # 3000 a month , all of which goes in to british banks trough the buy to let scheme . 
  the eastern europeans are paying billions in rent and billions in keeping businesses like corner shops and fish and chips take outs alive and thriving . 
  when their jobs go , so do they , and the landlords default on mortgages , of both commercial and residential properties . 
  it might be another 2008 . 
  this referendum was like an airline pilot asking the passengers which buttons to push in the cockpit , without telling them what any of the buttons do , and now everyone is surprised by the fact that the landing gear fell out in mid air and now landing will be either crashing or scraping hard and then crashing . 
  that asshole cameron did this to all of europe , just to get elected again and act all smug tits around the halls of westminster as the churchill of extorting the eu with his bullshit referendum . 
  he did this !, 
  calm your tits !, 
  they said much worse about us because of the gipsys pissing in marble arch . 
  the least european thing to do is to answer these engineered provocations by further dividing east and west . 
  this xenophobia is planted in these unremarkable disenfranchised morons , by eurosceptic propagandists . 
  its not the entire population that thinks like this , its just the undersexed human garbage that is now stuck on that island , whereas a century ago their own people would have gotten rid of them by flushing that british loo on colonies , and gifting them with these types of idiots as a form of social fertiliser . 
  now they 're stuck with them , piling up in council ghettos , fucking each other for child benefit and spending it on canned beer or heroin while they feed the kids hot dog spaghetti on plastic plates . 
  we 've all seen skint , benefits britain , life on the dole , benefits street etc. 
  the real british people , the ones that actually contribute to society , are victims in this brexit , more so than everyone else in europe . 
  or does it , 
  [ berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytydjbpbk6a ) . 
  here we go ... ** : / **, 
  well , if the uk left because of 3.9 % , the welsh should be able to as well , no ? 
  the canadian gipsy scandal was about hungarian gipsy . 
  if they were jews from romania no one would be calling them romanians , but because they 're gipsy , they get put in our basket . 
  the gipsy are an international nomadic community , they fled being made soap out of , and ended up scattered around eastern europe where they got trapped by the iron curtain , and forced to resort to exploiting their kids for survival . 
  have you 've ever considered that maybe some voted leave to provoke this scenario ? 
  they threw one grenade in the spaghetti , that only makes them likely to throw another one . 
  this was more of a tracer vote , ignorant people needed to see if democracy still worked , and so they tested the installation . 
  no one wanted this really , this is cameron 's nightmare . 
  he played with fire to try and extort the big boys . 
  now you all suffer the consequences because we do n't want other member countries to try their luck . 
  this is reverse christianity , you all die for his sins . 
  we do n't have them `` here '' because they 're all working in germany and the netherlands at asml . 
  there was a documentary here about the many romanians in top level positions at eu fortune 500 companies . 
  i meant nisan . 
  in my dystopian view of this , tensions lead to a fence being built , 
  and every time they do move its an eu company , like how we make gearboxes and dashboards and seats and other subassemblies for the german automotive industry , but we do n't get a silicon lithography plant from the americans , that goes to germany , we do n't get a korean kia factory , that goes to england , and so on . 
  in the east we only get what the west throws away , and we only get it if a western company actually keeps the profit and we get a few 275 eur a month pay checks . 
  eastern europe is the scotland of the eu , we get what they do n't want to keep . 
  but make no mistake , we 're not only happy about it , we 're fucking ecstatic !, 
  in about a year or so , donald tump could be on the border line between ireland and ni , giving a speech , urging the prime minister of the uk to allow for a reunification between the two , by saying : ** mister boris , tear down this fence !, 
  ** history does n't repeat itself , it just moves west , 
  it 's `` soft monopolies '' . 
  like germany killing the maybach while every rolls royce has a german name staring back at you when you open the hood . 
  romania and france have 0 competitors for the < 7000 eur automotive sector that is exclusive to dacia . 
  all of eastern europe has a unspoken agreement not to poach factories from the west , despite being much more attractive for the manufacturing sector . 
  none of us are buying chinese solar panels because to do so would cause damage to the german solar companies and lowering revenue for energy companies means no more investments in renewable projects . 
  this framework for cohesive strategy is what the uk threw away yesterday . 
  to play in our sandbox , they now have to allow every thing they do now in terms of unrestricted freedom of travel and labour , they have to participate in aid to humanitarian crises in the region , ( take asylum seekers and give money etc ) and the only thing they get in return , is sloppy seconds access to whatever we throw away . 
  a few hours ago , britain was doing better than it ever has in it 's history , they had 700.000 job vacancies and the highest gdp ever . 
  now they 're thinking about how to maybe , possibly , trough negotiates and compromise , somehow , in a decade maybe ... get back to yesterday .
