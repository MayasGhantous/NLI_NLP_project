  there 's a law that says the referendum can be invalidated if there 's a turnout of less than 75 % . 
  it was 72 % . 
  scotland , ni , wales declare independence and join , a broken england with a 60/40 remain london comes in separately and on own preferential terms . 
  they drag art . 
  50 out for a decade and then have another referendum . 
  this was decided by old uneducated lower middle class yobs from england , no one who actually matters in the uk will swallow this 52.9 when the hardcore repercussions start to bloom . 
  it 's nice to dream , is n't it ? 
  one thing to be mindful of ... 
  if any of those international partners you hope to serenade sweet nothing deals toward , had even an iota of confidence in you 're ability to `` to get a better deal '' and be a better player outside the eu , it would be the eur collapsing double digit percentage points against the dollar . 
  instead it 's the pound , and that says something about the level of confidence in your economically rebellious tantrum . 
  to put things in perspective , a third of a trillion vanished from your economy in 1 hour . 
  that 's more than your current contribution to the eu , for a half of century !, 
  so this brexit was about leaving the commonwealth ? 
  because 9 out of 12 million immigrants are from outside the union . 
  in fact 1 out of every 5 immigrants to the whole of the eu , is a commonwealth muslim . 
  because you ca n't feed ignorance with hunger . 
  when things get to where they seem to be going , people 's opinion will likely do a 180 . 
  yes but what you do n't seem to understand , is that the eu is still the european coal and steel community it was at it 's inception in 1952 . 
  ** it 's not access to a market it 's part ownership of one ** , secured trough an internally orchestrated system to protect national monopolies by substituting competition with collaboration . 
  being with us you had your goods guaranteed a market that was rigged to make sure you had no competitors for whatever you were granted a softly whispered monopoly by 27 potential competitors that got out of your way . 
  this ensures the social identities of everyone in the union . 
  now ... trading with us has to be from an outsider position where you stand against 27 with their own veto , each one defensively demanding you be imposed tariffs on , and outright denied access to certain parts of the market , for fear it would somehow challenge their carefully balanced contextual relevancy . 
  everything you want to sell not only to the eu but also to the major eu partners like usa , china etc , has to be debated among all those who stand to lose something as a result of you competing in their space . 
  this is where you fucked up insurmountably by brexiting . 
  now you 're out and those still in ca n't wait to eat your share , and have 0 reasons to give up anything to let you in from a `` forever out '' position . 
  they might have made a little room for norway , switzerland or even iceland but that 's only because they 're being groomed . 
  you however , are now untouchable and ** `` the must make an example out of '' ** , player . 
  i still have hope something will be done to prevent an actual exit , because being on the outside , aint all it 's been sold to be . 
  yes indeed , `` poverty is relative '' the current level of so called poverty will seem like an era to yearn for , when the real consequences of brexit set in . 
  multinationals that came to the uk for access to 508 million people , are already scouting european destinations to flee too , they wont wait two years from november to do it , because they do n't want to pick last and end up being late to a cascade of relocation incentives from other eu countries , or be around for god knows what exotic after effect this brexshit could have , even months down the line . 
  after about 20 % of the uk industry jumps to the main land , the first to be hurt the hardest are the areas with a majority of socially vulnerable people , like wales and ni . 
  as a german you should have had this explained to you in school . 
  it 's called radicalisation by way of [ false consciousness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_consciousness ) . 
  in russia , the human garbage were told `` hey , you 're not living like human garbage because of your own limitations and inadequateness , you 're human garbage because you 're being kept from greatness by the ** aristocracy ** !, 
  now let 's get together and get rid of 'em quickly , so we can be in charge . 
  ( ** bolshevism ** ) in germany , the human garbage were told `` hey , you 're not living like human garbage because of your own limitations and inadequateness , you 're human garbage because you 're being kept from greatness by the ** jews ** !, 
  now let 's get together and get rid of 'em quickly , so we can be in charge . 
  ( ** fascism ** ) in britain , the human garbage were told `` hey , you 're not living like human garbage because of your own limitations and inadequateness , you 're human garbage because you 're being kept from greatness by the ** european immigrants ** !, 
  now let 's get together and get rid of 'em quickly , so we can be in charge . 
  if things get to where scotland goes , northern ireland and wales are soon to follow . 
  and considering that london voted 60/40 you could see a full circle with england acceding to the eu ( head humbly down ) alongside the broken bits of the once mighty united kingdom . 
  there 's another english speaking island to the left . 
  problem solved . 
  because referendums are seen as opportunities by the unaccomplished , to throw a wrench in the machinery , hoping for a better life . 
   my entire nation voted to remain so i take it you 're scottish then ? 
  why even sweat this then ? 
  should n't you be somewhere doing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4ym9zokszo ) ? 
  the price of produce is 90 % + labour costs , as such , one could say , the british farmers do n't farm the land , ** they farm the eastern europeans !, 
  ** without peasants from eastern europe to work the fields , they 'll all be at the mercy of the local population and their famous chanting repertoire , like `` id rather be a picket than a scab '' and the delusions of salary entitlements that will collapse every farmer by making his produce uncompetitive or downright unaffordable . 
  a few hours ago , britain was doing better than it ever has in it 's history , they had 700.000 job vacancies and the highest gdp ever . 
  now they 're thinking about how to maybe , possibly , trough negotiates and compromise , somehow , in a decade maybe ... ** get back to yesterday ** . 
  you act as if this is a done deal  [ must strike the iron while hot ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4plnnm/brexit_david_cameron_announces_resignation/d4m1gzz ) this is chess not checkers . 
  things need to get very bad for the uk and they need to get very bad quickly , so as to justify a dissolution of the kingdom trough the secession of scotland , wales and the reunification of greater ireland and their immediate return in to the european union . 
  let 's be honest , this was decided by uneducated english yobs , even londoners were 60/40 . 
  now , nature needs to take it 's course . 
  action ... ** consequence ** !, 
  may this this be a lesson for all other countries . 
  referendums in capitalist democracies , mean turning the ditch digging morons in to neo-proletariat morons who think they can overcome their social identities as human garbage , by throwing a wrench in the machinery , whilst having a stupid hopeful look on their face . 
  i feel genuinely sorry for the 48 % stuck in there having to go trough all this , all the while knowing very well , that they 've been dragged in to it by those who they 're stuck paying for to stay at home and collect income support . 
  that being said , i , and i 'm sure many others , will from today on , pay very close attention to everything i buy , just to make sure it was n't manufactured in the uk . 
  i 'm cancelling my vodafone contract today , and i 'd like to urge everyone to do the same . 
  politically they might be able  but we the eu citizens are now scorned by their bullshit , and will spiteful celebrate our europeanness , by no longer buying uk made products and services . 
  for example i 'm switching from vodafone to orange . 
  a million yobs , have decided for 508 million  the glory of democracy in action . 
  the yobs have spoken , 
  [ but most of the kind if immigrants they speak of , are from outside the eu . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad-v3rullk8 ), 
  rumour has it , all new york coke dealers are tapped out . 
  everyone on wall street is pulling a 48h shift , ready to pounce on however this thing goes . 
  for currency jockeys , this is like 9.11 was for gold , only they know it 's happening . 
  nah ... they forgot about us  for three years they 've been bracing themselves for an invasion that never came . 
  i think to some extent they were actually offended by our not flooding their borders . 
  ** right now they 're thinking `` how bad things must have gotten in the uk , if romanians would rather stay in romania ''  ) . 
  ** need n't worry , it looks like they 're on to the turks now . 
  ** what an asshole !, 
  ** the only remain argument i can think to make , is the naked truth . 
  ** the european union is today , what it was in 1952 when it was called the european coal and steel community . 
  ** it 's a community of nations collaborating to protect soft national monopolies , in order to ensure the social identities for workers and have a secure economy by removing unnecessary internal competition . 
  ** basically a conspiracy of compromises to delegate contextual roles to each national entity , as such as to ensure a well balanced access to prosperity for all members . 
  ** being part of this union does not mean mere access to 508 million customers , it means the security of not having 508 million people working against you , in order to get to your customers !, 
  ** being in the eu means you get the certainty of having a slice of the european pie set aside , contingent on abiding by regulations set in place to ensure the certainty of everyone getting their slice . 
  being out , means you get periodically invited to pick trough the crumbs , whilst fighting an unwinnable battle , trying to keep the gigantic appetite of the mighty eu , from eating the slices you have now . 
  try `` 1992 s01 sub '' on kickasstorrents . 
   watch gomorrah thanx for suggesting this , i had no idea about it and i was looking for something similar to [ 1992 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2983290/ ) which i really loved , mostly because of how relatable the plot line was to what 's currently going on with the d.n.a in romania . 
  this referendum is basically asking people if they are happy with their lives and want to keep things stable , or if they do n't like their circumstances and would therefore be willing to gamble , based on the hopeful promise , of an uncertain future . 
  so giving that britain is now doing better than it ever has in it 's history , the majority is likely to be on the side of those who think , having a bird in each hand , is worth more than the unfounded promise of two others on a fence . 
  the notion that being part of the eu is just access to a market in exchange for sovereignty , and being allowed to sell to eu costumers , in exchange for the eu having a say in your busyness , is exactly what the `` leave '' campaigners are trying to mislead the british people with . 
  when in reality it means having part ownership of a market that is collectively managed to ensure prosperity for all shareholders . 
  this involves a level of cooperation and participation that is orchestrated weighing the implications for all parties involved , and is therefor reliant on compromise in some aspects for overall economic stability for all . 
  what the `` leave '' people do n't understand is that the other 27 stay out of their way , like for example the ultra luxury car market in britain is helped out by germany , who [ got out of that busyness ] ( http://www.autoguide.com/.../maybach-officially-dead.html ) and focused on helping them . 
  look at romania and the dacia , we do n't have any eu competition in the low cost segment , and have a wonderful collaboration with the french , because this is how the eu works , by protecting ** invisible national monopolies ** for the ** economic security of 508 million people ** . 
  if not for the eu free movement , the eastern europeans would have drained all the industry from the west , collapsing their every chance at having a middle class . 
  so the brain drain is a carefully balanced exchange where we do n't interfere in poaching factories and they look away from inter-eu migrant workers bleeding billions from their economies by exporting their salaries and bringing them to romania . 
  by being a mere associate , you do n't get a slice of the eu pie set aside for yourself , you 're just someone allowed to pick up crumbs and maybe have a taste if there 's any left . 
  90 % of what the eu is , will never be seen on a piece of legal paper . 
  the eu is allot of careful whispers and handshakes . 
  great , when are the leaving ? 
  their lease is up anyway . 
  if they leave , we should cancel our vodafone contracts . 
   is it not reasonable to change what makes you unhappy ?
