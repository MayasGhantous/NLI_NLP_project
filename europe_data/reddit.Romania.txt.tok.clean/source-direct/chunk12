  why do citizens of the eu have to remain silent about the state they live in ? 
  the problem is , you do n't actually change anything , it 's all just a mirage , your life does n't improve , because of a universal law that governs social identities . 
  your life now , will be your life then . 
  there 's no magic stamp that can change your stance in the grand scheme of things . 
  the more you see people making arguments for leave , the more you see it for what it is . 
  ** a case of conditioned misplaced aggression and oppositional defiance , based on promoting the illusion that everything you ** `` do n't have '' ** is as a result of being ** kept from greatness ** , and not because of your ** limitations and inadequacies ** ( basically the proletariat model ) all framed carefully with arguments based on disinformation and falsehood meant to give you an alternative to your self loathing . 
  misplaced hatred makes it much easier to think your miserable life is as such because of someone else , perhaps someone who did not `` put britain first '' because then you can think of yourself as the ever glorious `` death to traitors '' that way you do n't have to admit to being a lowly unremarkable nothing of a person , in his 50s . 
   we could have the parliament elect the commissioner . 
  [  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jts4rpiuwae ) you need to think this trough . 
  when you promote a social atmosphere where pro-romanian means exclusion and marginalization , and pro-russian-ism is reworded with privileged preferential access to scares comforts , creatures of comfort such as humans , tend to take the path of least resistance . 
  that way they can be susceptible to special interest , lobbing and bribing their way to a designer commission , turning us in to a european `` house of cards '' there 's a reason they set it up the way it is . 
  that 's why most countries with monarchies are more stable . 
  because the infallible ultra privileged royalty , are wholly incorruptible . 
  ** this circus is not defined by nationalism . 
  ** it 's text book radicalization , it relies on exasperating the discomfort and playing on the hopes of the disenfranchised and unaccomplished , by programing them to think themselves empowered to change the status quo , by resetting the establishment with the hope of resetting their unfortunate circumstance , and starting a new , getting a second chance , etc. 
  there 's no way to make an informed decision about the future because you never have all the variables . 
  therefore , the illusion of having arguments is just a veneer over what is actually an emotional path to decision , polarizing society . 
  - a group will always vote against radical change an civil framework disruption , emotionally driven to their choice by an inventory of circumstance in which they asses their life as , well balanced , happy , secure , prosperous , etc. 
  - and another group , that is defined by unfavorable positioning in society , marginalized , unhappy , socially vulnerable and eager to disprove it , etc. 
  these people 's hopes for change make them very susceptible to manipulation and opinion implantation , carefully formulated to have all their insecurity and inferiority anxiety , aimed at a target , which becomes emblematic of their preconceived oppression and barrier to their dream of a new self , all the while rewording adherence to this radical mindset , with the validation , acceptance and sanctuary of camaraderie , among a society of equally unfortunate , like minded and hopeful followers . 
  sadly these people can not be reasoned with , because their unhappiness and hatred of their life takes them beyond the point where they would act responsibly and in self interest , because their desire to change is now so overwhelmingly powerful , to where they are willing to gamble , as they feel they do n't have much to lose , or to stand with , and blindly throw themselves in to the uncertain . 
  ** the only thing this referendum will reveal , is how many uk citizens are happy with their lives , and how many are n't . 
  ** it has nothing what so ever with reasonable choice , nationalism or pro-european-ism . 
  pur\u00e9e these [ nuts ] ( http://www.google.ro/url?url=http://www.albanesecandy.com/nuts/&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=u&amp;ved=0ahukewiw14ibw7lnahwhxbqkhtuzccgqww4iftaa&amp;sig2=hiooa203pa85xywuvwm9aw&amp;usg=afqjcnhpfx3mzcfoor8boyzbvtziy6xjga ) !, 
  you 're thinking of `` aspic '' which is basically stuff in jelly . 
  ours are pig knuckles neck and face meat with off cuts and pig skin cuts , boiled until the meat and various cartilages fall off the bone , then the liquid is boiled further with pig bones cut to expose the marrow and mixed with about 500 + grams of garlic piure and poured in deep plates , over bits of meat , and left to cool over a winter night , until a foamy lair of bubbly lard forms on top which is then garnished with salt pepper and sweet ball pepper paprika before served cold . 
  ** edit ** : i only mentioned `` racituri '' because it seems to be the most objectionable dish when experienced by [ foreigners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjctyt2klru ) , who have been known to reference it as `` pig face jelly '' . 
  they must not have heard about our ** racituri/piftii ** , 
  i wish there were a global referendum to leave the solar system ... 
  the more likely scenario is the eu braking up the uk by allowing accession to scotland and wales and using soft force to thaw out the frozen conflict in northern ireland . 
  [ they 're half way there already . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ok08z/nicola_sturgeon_will_talk_to_brussels_directly/?ref=search_posts ) so it 's likely england would be joining the eu as a separate nation , in about a decade . 
  ** look at all those eastern european names . 
  britain sure needs to secure it 's borders alright , by maybe having another referendum after this one ... ** on leaving the commonwealth . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnmotv9wjvm ) an interview that shows how dispassionate the leader of the `` stay '' campaign is , to the aggravation and disparity of people who stand to see their lives ruined , because this duplicitous cunt legitimized ukip 's nonsense message , just so he could ** extort ** the eu . 
  this kind of politics need to be answered in kind by the european commission . 
  well , boris johnson has just stopped the leave campaigning in response to this . 
  edit : [ sky news live ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60wdzzt8yg&amp;list=wl&amp;index=1 ), 
  premature maturity and having a mobile phone for a parent , at it 's worst . 
   oh wait its the eu . 
  actually it 's you . 
  one out of 5 immigrants coming to the eu is a commonwealth muslim with a british passport . 
   step 1 ) stop importing muslims . 
  heed . 
  he should sign over his entire net worth to a trust that will redistribute the money to post-brexit victims such as people who will lose their jobs , houses , pensions etc. 
  in fact all the top wealthiest brexiters should have papers put in front of them before the referendum . 
  that 'll show they 're all rain making this economic suicide brexit nonsense for their own political gain , being that they 're otherwise unremarkable and have never contributed anything to british welfare , other than hot air , that is . 
  so i suppose the fact that most licit money laundering for covert russian bullshit being done trough london , the fact that the uk has more than half of all the kgb oligarchs as permanent residents , the fact that much of your media and football clubs are russian oligarchy owned , the fact that russian billionaires are celebrated openly even after they gifted putin with a # 30.000.000 yacht , when 298 people were killed on the mh17 , not to mention what happened with alexander litvinenko or gareth williams and the fact that london has more russian operatives than moscow . 
  all these indicate that , even tough euro-skepticism was proven to be financed by the kremlin , in hungary , france , sweden , finland , iceland , greece , france , austria etc. 
  the uk happens to be the only genuinely euro-skeptic movement around , despite the mountain of compromising evidence clearly evident ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say ? 
  is that what i 'm ignorant about ? 
  if what happened with gareth williams were to have happened anywhere else in europe , the sky would have fallen down !, 
  you just wiped it off , and on you went . 
  well in all fairness , its not the states that get bullied , just the ignorant minority who wants to leave . 
  most of this euro-skepticism is kremlin fueled . 
  so bashing the idiots back in line , with strong arguments and an adequate presentation about universal realities of what being a competitor means , is very a gentle measure of dealing with what are effectively treasonous fraternizers with enemy doctrine in a hybrid war . 
  those are gypsy , not romanians they are homeless because that 's how they live , like your travelers . 
  and you 've been doing a good job of making them feel unwelcome , unlike sweden , which means they 'll move on , soon enough . 
  east europeans live in # 10 a day share houses , 10 to a `` buy to let '' house , in bunk beds like oil platform workers . 
  that 's # 36.500 a year per house , which if they were to vanish in the millions , could mean hundreds of thousands of mortgages defaulted on , and tens of thousands of commercial properties would follow because they also spend a lot of money , more then they do on rent , in corner shops and fish and chip shops . 
  another thing that would collapse , is the british horticultural industry , and part of the construction sector . 
  a lot of companies make good money off of people from ee . 
  if brexit happens , many will leave for germany , ireland , ( switzerland is now open market ) , because they ca n't afford to hang around for however long it takes for the uk to come back , and that would be disastrous , for many brits . 
  the points based system is useless if you are open to commonwealth influx from people who 's documentation can be faked for 20 dollars they can have the paperwork of a brain surgeon . 
  i just think it 's unreasonable to blame eu migration for all your troubles , when you have 12.000.000 immigrants and only 2 million of those are from the eu , many of which are seasonal migrants coming and going on 3 hour # 27 flights . 
  you ca n't pick strawberries year round , so although they have a nino , they do n't count as much as the pakistani community for ex . 
  [ if you do n't like immigrants , why bring so many of them here ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4o1du9/5_million_foreigners_granted_citizenship_in_eu_in/ ) and freedom of movement is a holy virtue and fundamental principle because it allows everyone so seek opportunities wherever an opportunity would have him or her . 
  stop thinking about immigrants like flood , the number of people who stay in the uk is limited by how many of them find jobs . 
  i 'd like to see the leavsters like farage and johnson , sign legal documents agreeing to donate everything they own to a trust meant to offer financial relief to the victims of brexit , like people loosing houses , jobs , savings , etc. 
  they 're all promises and no risk . 
  suck it croatia !, 
  if 150.000 mortgages are defaulted on , other owners will scramble to rent , and drive the market down to where renting could be cheaper than paying a 300.000 mortgage for a house now worth 175.000 , and that 's when you pass the point of no return . 
  housing market crash , state of emergency , recession , depression , people being afraid to spend money again , etc. 
  everything will be very affordable , is just that by that time , there wont be anyone there to afford it . 
  not to mention that without a million people there , corner shops an fish and chip shops , barbers , estate agents , gambling parlors and countless other jobs for locals , will simply vanish , and along with them the rent or mortgage contracts for both employees and busynesses also get defaulted on and onward goes the demolition of what is now a very strong economy . 
  and one million is a very very conservative estimate . 
  funny how everyone remembers it like that , but there 's a reason it 's not called the nira . 
  we live in a world of a thousand kosovos . 
  the idea of having capital cities and national governments infringing on the freedoms of neighboring communities for the sake of archaic nationalisms while already enveloped in a supra-governmental community like the european union , is becoming something more and more difficult to justify , and nearly impossible to achieve without significant compromise and damage to the freedoms of many . 
  all mammals fear what they do n't understand . 
  you could stop a billionaire nest from forming in a pocket region with a few laws at a federal level . 
  so your ridiculous redistribution of wealth is communist garbage . 
  self manifestation of wealth under a federal level playing field , is the future !, 
  centralized national governments make it easy to fuck people over if you do n't have to live next door to them , or wallow in the shit you condemn them to . 
  a federation of incorporated european municipalities , takes care of that and then some . 
  why not spew this bullshit to someone from catalonia , see what he thinks . 
  you wan na know why germany is top dog in this woods ? 
  they have ** independent ** lands !, 
  taking away all the power from the entire political class in europe is something you find objectionable ? 
  whose tit are you sucking ? 
  bugetarule . 
  if the economy contracts as most economists have predicted , even the indians and pakistani could float off . 
  the leave campaign forgets to mention that if a million east europeans leave , that 's 100.000 + houses in the buy to let scheme defaulting on their mortgages , not to mention all the other ones from under working class renters and mortgage owners who will find themselves laid off because the investors that came to the uk for 508 million costumers , would now have to flee to the continent . 
  ... and debt . 
  what about when oslo accepts refugees and builds refugee communities away from oslo , in say ... stavanger , bergen and \u00c5lesund ? 
  perhaps a more informed understanding that ** the disillusion of national governments never has to mean the end of national identities !, 
  ** it 's just your administration in the context of the european community that will no longer be proxied trough an intermediary corrupt and costly national government , instead it will be streamlined between local power and federal protection . 
  the sense of nationality wont go away , they 'll still sing anthems before a football game .
