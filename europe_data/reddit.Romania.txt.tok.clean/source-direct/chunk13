  you 'll still have national cuisine , traditions , etc. 
  people need to understand more of this . 
  not with this kind of defeatism , it wont . 
  everything is only a good presentation and a referendum away . 
  not even nuts-3 could work , [ here 's why ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4nycfl/pew_poll_europeans_want_a_more_active_european/d48ht05 ) . 
  except they 're not are they ? 
  intra-national [ inequalities ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4nycfl/pew_poll_europeans_want_a_more_active_european/d48j5va ) are a thing now . 
  actually you have n't  i believe communism and democracy to be equally ridiculous in that they both force the illusion of social equality . 
  in communism you get just as many coupons to buy eggs if you 're a street sweep or a scientist . 
  in a democracy you get the same number of votes if you 're a piece of garbage , or someone that 's a remarkable contributor for the advancement of human society . 
  i said ** `` a european federation of sovereign municipal corporations '' ** , not a usoe mega-state . 
  so basically thousands of monaco like communities , under a federal legislative framework , single currency , intelligence agency , environmental guidelines , etc. 
  if romania had a `` national pot '' , bucharest would be paved with gold and the rest would be horse cart riding neo-serfs starving to death . 
  your system is insane when you think houses in liverpool could n't be given away for 50p , whereas an identical terrace in london is a million + . 
  might it have something to do with london making sure that london is wrapped in industry and wealth , whilst all other areas of the uk are left to rot . 
  there 's a romanian proverb , `` cine-mparte , parte-\u0219i face ! '', 
  but in what i proposed you would have a european council with representatives that are limited in governing over you at a local level . 
  they would only act a mediation in conflicts of regional interest . 
  local tax revenue ** matters ** the basically take money we work for and build their community , while ours is denied organic growth and burdened with all logistics costs , such as infrastructure maintenance . 
  centralized national governments , are the foremost impactfull handbrake on growth . 
  by now they 're all just neo-bolshevik entities . 
  the larger the national structure , the more powerful the administrative oligarchy , the weaker the individual . 
  what rearranging ? 
  you already have a city council that would become like a parliament . 
  and cities that have grown together should be free to negotiate jurisdiction and collaborative projects by themselves , trough local referendums . 
  it would n't be taxation by other countries , because there wont be any other countries , and direct taxation by the eu would be justified for all the benefits of being part of such a community . 
  about foreign investment ... romania has a law that obligates all foreign and domestic companies with a 20 + million eur annual revenue , to register with the fiscal authorities in bucharest and therefore have their headquarters in bucharest . 
  i live in transilvania in cluj and i see that law as a way to obfuscate economic growth from the provinces and bring wealth to the capital . 
  they did this to bring all the big money in their sphere of influence and ensure tenancy for their industrial parks and office buildings . 
  all the money spent in supermarkets and malls in cluj is taxed in bucharest and stays there . 
  when you look at a romanian regional gdp per county map , you see bucharest above everything else because even dough the factories are in the provinces , the headquarters are in the capital . 
  depending on where in the uk you come from you could know more about this undermining by `` residual prioritisation governing '' than most . 
  a lot ended up in london that maybe should n't have . 
  every city in the eu has a `` km 0 '', 
  the agricultural surface has to be under regulation of a european agricultural ministry , eu subsidies already work like this . 
  small remote communities that ca n't ensure basic european charter requirements like have own schools , hospitals etc. 
  can not be cities and would be included in the territory nearest to it . 
  exactly ... look at christiania , lichtenstein , monaco etc. 
  the idea is already there , it just needs more power . 
  reactionary nonsense from people who fear losing something they do n't own to begin with . 
  regions would mean you could end up with a large city of 49 % having to conform to the laws of one or more neighboring cities effectively being limited in their ability to self determine who they are , just as under a national superimposed system . 
  but what is `` their country '' ? 
  could you as a englishman from the uk call northern ireland your country and impose your english values and laws on them ? 
  is n't this why the ira formed in the first place ? 
  why would that be , if every city in europe would basically become it 's own country , free to exert local power and manifest self determination . 
  the eu would envelope these cities as a federal framework , meaning local laws would be adhering to certain federation wide principles . 
  for example making sure to veto a law that would allow the formation of a geopolitical entity where raping children is legal or insufficiently punished . 
  such a system would mean empowerment for all european citizens an the end of national impositions on the freedoms of many . 
  / u/blurandski , / u/darkmoon _ uk , / u/glideer , / u/scundoo what i mean is not to surrender sovereignty and form a united states of europe where our national governments become part of a federation . 
  what i 'm proposing is that every city be semi sovereign , with individual laws that merely conform to a european framework but are in fact tailored for every self defined community . 
  if a city wants to ban smoking there should be no national or supranational body deciding against that , trough a single law covering tens of millions , is should be local power under federal protection . 
  we do n't live in countries , we live in communities , gatherings of like minded individuals coming together to collectivity contribute toward common goals and live life surrounded by a purposely tailored environment . 
  even the leave campaign would like to be in such a system because this , although allowing freedom of travel , would imply powers that limit freedom of establishing residency . 
  if you want to be part of a certain community , you 'd have to seek acceptance by proving to be someone they could welcome in to their lives . 
  also the locally governed welfare state would mean that you wont have to pay as much to finance the delinquent non contributing citizens from other places outside your community . 
  ** i want all national governments dissolved . 
  ** we should be a federal european community of independent [ municipal corporations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/municipal_corporation ) , every city should be an independently governed geopolitical area , part of a federal european government , with a single central bank , a single intelligence agency , a single military structure etc. 
  nationality should be cultural and nothing more . 
  i have faith most of the uk is n't stupid enough to shoot themselves in both legs . 
  brexiters are at most 15 % of the population . 
  there could be a problem if the `` stay in '' voters will be too lazy to show up to vote . 
  then you should n't have read it outloud . 
  that 's how the `` revolution '' in romania was put together . 
  first we sold a lot to the west and grew to where we became dependent on exporting , then they tightened embargo rules and locked us out until we ran out of money , ** but they allowed food to be exported , so the country was famished and people started to revolt out of misery and desperation ** . 
  we 're ok with refugees , they 're [ not ] ( https://www.vice.com/.../afghan-refugees-in-romania-crying-not-hungary - 876 ) ok with us . 
  you 're thinking of the the visegrad group ( the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia ) they formed a united front to reject quotas . 
  we play ball with all eu decisions . 
  how was it `` equalized '' if non of them were bleeding at the end ? 
  we 're ( i 'm ) not ungrateful or ignorant of what we gain . 
  i 'm just pointing out that these funds are not a charitable give away , and that we the net beneficiaries are not the only beneficiaries of these investments . 
  we , the whole of the european community benefit together , even tough the money gets spent within romania 's geopolitical territory , the beneficiaries are ultimately the european industries that strengthen the ** european ** economy . 
  we make a lot of the subcomponents for the german automotive industry , so while not directly making cars , we contribute extensively to that ecosystem , and by having lower wage costs we make it all the more profitable and competitive . 
  therefore , these roads lead to european prosperity , and not romanian benefit . 
  why are ** you ** pretending like you get nothing out of it ? 
  i guess we 'd feel more grateful about it , if it were not for the fact that it feels like were just here for western interest to embezzle funds , by shitting something sub par on our heads and expecting us to say , thanx for the hat . 
  you can not get 100 % eu funds for anything . 
  it 's 80 % from the eu and 20 % from governmental or regional budgets . 
  your being italian and talking about our `` road enjoyment '' , is very ironic , seeing as how one of the biggest [ scandals ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/economic/cnadnr-a-facut-plangere-penala-impotriva-firmei-salini-impregilo-pentru-autostrada-sibiu-orastie-14879589 ) ever in our eu funds misappropriations , is about salini impregilo , an italian company who built us a segment of motorway that ** collapsed after 3 months ** and now has to be repaired at enormous cost because , it turns out they skimped on thousands of tons of reenforcement materials , basically just painting asphalt on unstable dirt . 
  foreign infrastructure companies , cash in all those eu funds for building roads in romania , to reach the new factories , where we 're expected to work for 1.5 eur/hour . 
  so making us look like privileged assholes sittin pretty is not exactly an accurate depiction . 
  and the only reason we have `` new factories '' is because we had to tear down the old ones , because our new western friends did n't like the idea of us empowering various oil rich countries with our extraction and refinery equipment . 
  they had other , more perverse , plans for those dictatorships , so we played ball and adhered to those pre-eu accession embargo rules , even at cost of condemning many of our cites to becoming third world shitholes . 
  how come we do n't hear anyone saying shit about germany taking all that marshall plan money ? 
  the eu says , ** `` hey romania , absorb these funds . 
  '' ** romania grabs it 's crotch and says ** `` absorb this !, 
  '' ** then out of nowhere jumps poland and runs away with everything . 
  ** we need to take back control of our borders !, 
  ** i 'm sick and tired of all these criminals from the various islands around us , coming here on the continent thinking they can do whatever they want and get away with it , because some laws in bruxelles protect them . 
  how much longer can we stand for this ? 
  it was more than one , becali and niculae that we know of , and others suspected of having dilapidated in the billions but the money was never found . 
  now they 've got paszkany as well and there 's the petrom case where patriciu supposedly faked his death in the uk , having bilked us for 650.000.000 eur that we know of . 
  here 's a 2010 [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi5im5mciji ) about some of the former securitate oligarchs that try to explain how they became so wealthy . 
  most of them were foreign intelligence operatives , entrusted with making business contacts in western companies , to get romanian industrial goods past the iron curtain embargo , via various proxy nations . 
  they were basically given special training to undermine foreign economies for profit , and have all come back after 1989 to use that same tradecraft against us , as an infallible intelligence-mafia , either directly behind or offering protection for others involved with corruption ad embezzlement from public acquisitions . 
  ** they 're all in jail or dead now  ** curtesy of the anticorruption crusade currently changing romania . 
  turns out , if you put a bunch a billionaires in jail , all of a sudden the whole world takes notice . 
  well , it 's not like you 'd be going far anyway . 
  from skopje you can drive to timisoara in about 5 and a half hours , 
  cluj-napoca romania junior - $ 500-750 $ middle - $ 1250 - $ 2000 senior - $ 2500 - $ 4000 management - $ 5000 - $ 10000 + * side note * - there are no employee taxes for most it professionals . 
  romanian by far and away !,
