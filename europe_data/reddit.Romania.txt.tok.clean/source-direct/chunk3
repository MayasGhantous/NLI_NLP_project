  as from the 29.07.2016 , several british reporters arrived at the airport in targu-mures , in order to make the journalistic documentary report . 
  the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai waited for them with one car specially rented to develop that activity . 
  subsequently , the reporters and their companion talked about the details of the documentary report and the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai was told that he should ask the people , who were described as `` gunrunner '' , to wear hoods . 
  likewise , he received the questions and the answers he was supposed to provide to the so-called smugglers , including the prices for some weapons . 
  the reports had the following requirements : to do the filming in one isolated wooded area surrounded by hills , the car , used by the smugglers , not to carry the registration plates and the weapons to be covered with a blanket . 
  as the british reporter asked to be produced ak sporting rifles , the defendant p\u00e1ntics attila-csaba asked a different person to borrow him one um sadu , cal .7,62 x39 weapon , arm which was part of the `` collection '' which that person legally held . 
  although the mentioned weapon was lawfully held , its holder was not authorized to take it out from the place of residence or to borrow it , according to the law ( act no . 
  295/2004 on arm and ammunition policy ) . 
  after having fulfilled the requirements of the british reporters , on the 31.07.2016 , in the morning , the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai drove to the hotel in which four people of the british tv channel team were accommodated . 
  those people and he travelled by car from targu-mured to the city of jeica , mures county , where they met with the defendants pantics atilla csaba and pantic levente . 
  the two individuals got into the same off-road car and travelled together with the british reporters . 
  two kilometers away from the meeting place , the defendant pantics atilla csaba stopped the suzuki samurai vehicle and the defendant pantics levente and he got out . 
  subsequently , they put the hoods on ( hoods seized during the house searches ) and one of the british reporters asked the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai to wear also a hood , as he was `` the dealer of the gunrunners '' . 
  as he had no hood , some people of the film crew handed him one hood , one cap and one jacket . 
  subsequently , they made the video material , by asking the questions and by receiving the already prepared answers . 
  the romanian citizens were expressly asked to speak in romanian , even if the mother tongue of the defendants is hungarian . 
  in this context , all data and information verbally communicated and recorded in the video material of the british tv channel , which were disseminated by means of many tv channels and mass-media components , including online , being aware of their fake contents ( the people in the video were no gun runners , but hunters , and the weapons they possessed and produced were sporting rifles duly held ) , jeopardized the national security . 
  to the same effect , by acting in bad faith and by being aware that the sporting rifles which the romanian defendants ( who held firearm permits for some of these , as mentioned above ) provided to them and which they described as weapons of war in the video material , the general public ( the documentary report was broadcast by the british national tv channel ) was provided one scenario which , if it had been real , it would have given the impression that the romanian authorities did not manage or they had no interest in managing a so-called problem generated by the weapon selling in their country , for incompetence or corruption related reasons . 
  besides the turn of phrase , absolutely unacceptable and unreasonable , used by the british reporters and accepted by their employer , the tv channel , the actions of the british journalist group in romania can jeopardize the romanian state 's national security , by misguiding the european authorities and the general public in europe and romania regarding the readiness of the romanian authorities to handle the smuggling of weapons , originating from conflict areas , adjacent to romania , which could enable the providing of extremely dangerous war weapons to some terrorism groups in the western europe ( target of many terrorist attacks in the last years ) and in the middle east . 
  thus , if these actions were real , they would be part of the islamic terrorism financing by romania , by means of the coward and passive complicity of the authorities of this country . 
  if the romanian authorities had not had a rapid and effective response , all these issues would have remained in public memory as their authors wanted to describe them . 
  in this respect , it is taken into consideration the national security concept , as it is provided by art . 
  1 of act no . 
  51/1991 , this law governing all actions related to the national security of romania . 
  the false information , as above mentioned , have generated an insecurity feeling among people , and the institutions and agencies , with competence in the filed of public order and security , have made big efforts , by involving logistic and human resources , in order to identify , as soon as possible , the people in the video material and to counter a possible threat . 
  the prosecutors within diicot -- central structure will proceed , by one letter of request , to the summoning of the british reporters , for them to be interrogated about the above-mentioned issues , pursuant to the provisions of the criminal law and of the law on international legal co-operation . 
  the action was carried out with the assistance of the romanian police . 
  the specialized support was provided by the special operation directorate . 
  the specialized support was provided by the romanian intelligence service . 
  the action was carried out with the assistance of vlad \u0162epe\u015e special intervention brigade within the gendarmerie . 
  there should be mentioned that , throughout the criminal proceeding , the suspects and defendants benefit from the procedural rights and guarantees , provided by the criminal procedure code , as well as from the presumption of innocence . 
  press release 11.08.2016 [ eng ] on the 11.08.2016 , the prosecutors within diicot -- central structure ordered the commencement of the criminal prosecution and the 24 hour-arrest of the defendants szanto aurelian-mihai , p\u00c1ntics attila-csaba and pantics levente , for the commission of the offences of setting-up of one organised criminal group , the violation of regulations on weapons and ammunition and submission of false information . 
  following the tv program , broadcast by one tv channel in the united kingdom and retransmitted by the central and local mass media , having as object the members of one organised criminal group specialized in arm and ammunition smuggling , diicot -- central structure commenced one criminal prosecution focused on the commission , by several individuals , of the offences of setting-up of one organised criminal group , aggravated smuggling and violation of regulations on weapons and ammunition . 
  within this case , it was ordered the carrying out of enquiries , on an urgent basis , with a view to rapidly identifying all individuals described as `` gunrunners '' in the mass media material , in relation to those weapons which were to be sold to people , to identifying the off-road vehicle , as well as with a view to gather all data and information necessary to solve the criminal case . 
  the tv program , broadcast by the british tv channel , was retransmitted by the mass media in romania and other eu member states . 
  according to the review of the related news , as well as to the commentaries disseminated within the public environment , the described offences generated , on the one hand , some reproachful feelings towards romania , and , on the other hand , insecurity among the romanian nationals , considering some possible threats against the national security . 
  thus , the actions produced within the journalistic investigation , carried out by the british tv channel , and the answers of the so-called gunrunners to the questions made by the reporters generated a strong fear among the civilians , as well as a high insecurity feeling . 
  following the investigations and enquiries , carried out within the case , there have been identified the individuals described as `` gunrunners '' in the mass-media material . 
  those individuals wore hoods and sunglasses for them not to be identified . 
  likewise , there have been detected and seized the weapons described in the material of the british reporters . 
  within the investigation carried out , it could be settled that the three people in the mentioned mass-media material are the defendants szanto aurelian-mihai , the so-called `` dealer '' and the one who ensured the translation from/into english and into/from romanian , p\u00c1ntics attila-csaba and pantics levente , individuals who described and offered the fire arms for sale . 
  in fact , according to the enquiries carried out , the so-called journalistic investigation did not rely on real actions and circumstances , but it was created on reporter initiative , by producing some false data and information as real . 
  thus , it could be established that , in the early days of july , 2016 , the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai , romanian citizen , living as a resident in the united kingdom for several years , was called by a british journalist , who he had met before , who proposed him to work as a translator for the british tv channel . 
  the journalist told him that he wanted to make a documentary film on gunrunners and asked him to find people willing to show fire arms . 
  although the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai replied that he had no possibility to produce military weapons , but only sporting rifles , which a friend of him lawfully possessed in romania , the mentioned reporter agreed . 
  subsequently , the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai got into contact with his friend , the defendant p\u00e1ntics attila-csaba , who agreed to do so . 
  thus , he was to make the weapon presentation together with his cousin pantics levente .

   two kilometers away from the meeting place , the defendant pantics atilla csaba stopped the suzuki samurai vehicle and the defendant pantics levente and he got out . 
  subsequently , they put the hoods on ( hoods seized during the house searches ) and ** one of the british reporters asked the defendant szanto aurelian-mihai to wear also a hood , as he was `` the dealer of the gunrunners '' . 
  as he had no hood , some people of the film crew handed him one hood , one cap and one jacket . 
  **  subsequently , they made the video material , by asking the questions and by receiving the already prepared answers .

  ...  `` we 've disused it last night and you 're not behind the cameras today , you 're in front with them '' this exact description was given by szanto , passing tv cameras as he left diicot questioning . 
  ( footage not available online ), 
  3.3 is actually 2.9 and that 2.9 is actually more like a 2.0 because many nino cards were issued to seasonal migrants who have since returned back home to the eu . 
  szanto ( the guy in sun glasses ) is a `` freelancer `` living in london since 2009 . 
  he was the fixer who organised everything , he said he was n't supposed to be in the in the video , but in the day in question , craig , the former british special forces `` arms expert '' handed him a balaclava and said `` we 've disused it last night and you 're not behind the cameras today , you 're in front with them '' , 
  this possible misunderstanding is ruled out by the fact that every aspect of what the protagonists did , was literally scripted . 
  they were instructed how to react what to say and were provided sky masks and vests for authenticity . 
  furthermore , the footage is actually `` second take '' meaning they filmed for a while and then realized a microphone was malfunctioning , and they reshot the scenes repeating everything including the dialog . 
  all these are officially written as statements by the three romanians currently under arrest . 
  on a side note , that ak-47 lookalike is actually a crippled version called [ ak-74 ] ( http://www.earme.ro/ak-74/ant-3007/ ) and it 's a semi automatic hunting rifle that could never even be modified in to an ak-47 because only some components are similar , but the internal mechanisms are completely different , something the former british special forces `` arms expert '' accompanying ramsay should have noticed immediately . 
   hard line anti-russian optically yes . 
  in reality , being the watchful and protective zookeepers at the russian oligarchy exhibit known as london , would beg to differ . 
  if putin ever retires , he 'll likely do so , to new life as a yacht enthusiast football team owner , somewhere in england . 
  `` poor journalism '' is what sky news is guilty of , as an organisation . 
  they wo n't go to jail for that , but hopefully there will be some consequences . 
  stuart ramsay however , contacted the romanian authorities about his dealings with supposed gun traffickers . 
  this brought on an official investigation by the romanian anti-organised crime agency and the romanian intelligence service as it is a matter of national security . 
  when they caught the men in the video , they confessed to being paid 2000 eur , to act as gun traffickers and bring their personal hunting rifles as props , and were told that the footage was going to be presented as a staged reproduction of what an actual illegal weapons trade in eastern europe might look like . 
  they then aired the edited footage as an actual encounter with gun traffickers added in some clips from the charlie hebdo attacks , and presented romania as an unscrupulous shithole , where for 1700 eur a romanian would sell an ak-47 to anyone , including an isis attacker , and then sit back and watch the news showing western europeans being murdered , whilst counting his 1700 eur and laughing . 
  what ramsay did is the same as calling in a fake bomb threat . 
  you ca n't preoccupy anti terrorism and national security resources with fake bullshit , and not go to jail ... 
  i do n't even want to think what they would do to someone who does something like this in the us . 
   meanwhile we 're one of the few countries to actually send troops to eastern europe . 
  name something consequential that was ever a confrontational position against russia . 
  you keep lip singing in the choir and you think no one is noticing , always quick to add to something where adding does n't make a difference , coming in to help lift something that everybody else is already carrying . 
  whatever yo do is always timid as if you 're going out of your way to look dispassionate in your involvement . 
  what actual value is there in being another participant to military exercises when you knowingly empower them trough laundering the money they use to buy influence and further their ambitions globally ? 
  anywhere else in europe , if the owner of a football club would have gifted putin a 30 million pound yacht , his life would not have been worth shit the very next second , especially after a passenger jet with 300 , mostly european people , was shot down by guerilla mercenaries that you helped pay for . 
  your relationship with russia is duplicitous-semi-reluctantly-complicit , in leaving behind this trail of atrocities they 've financed with your help . 
  do we really need to go in to the gutless prostitution of moral values exemplified with the lack of diplomatic sanctions following the damming alexander litvinenko report ? 
  according to this map , stuart ramsay staged that gun trafficking editorial in central europe not eastern . 
   we have been playing the mainlanders against each other for centuries that perfidious albion smirk was knocked clean off your stiff upper lip the day the coal and steel community was funded . 
  your guild might still have some influential actors playing in foreign theatres , but they 've become like an inside joke that everyone forces themselves to laugh about . 
  even the complex dealings with the americans , the terrorist credit score rating systems and the `` arm '' in everyone 's pocket , are `` cautiously tolerated '' , and what once was , is not likely to ever be again , you 've made quite sure of that . 
   a few years ago we were one of the only countries pushing for tougher sanctions against russia a carefully mimicking of opposition , slightly on a more offensive note than the rest , perhaps to overcompensate for the true role you play in the russian context . 
  do we really need to get in to the whole thing about your bending over to become a western european kitsch theme park for their kgb oligarchy , babysitting strategically held wealth in and around london ? 
   `` as a romanian '' one day account ... why do n't you ask csaba , zsolt , levente and szanto , the four magyar idiots from the sky news frame-job article , why they jumped at the opportunity to make romania look like a morally bankrupt eastern shithole , by dressing up as ** romanian ** gun trafikers ? 
  or maybe look up beke istvan and stop pretending to be romanian on here . 
  it 's a pathetic attempt to bank some leverage for post-brexit negotiations with the eu . 
  they 're trying to threaten the eu with `` closer ties '' with russia like iceland , turkey and every other eu satellite yelling up the fortress walls . 
  but how much closer can you really get ? 
  i mean after what happened with gareth williams when he got close to the truth about the russian covert money floating around london , not to mention the splendid cover-up ... what 's left really ? 
  perhaps throwing an icelandic style bitch fit , and threatening to host the russian fleet in the channel . 
  there are 3 separate investigations in to the staged editorial : ** sky news ** is being accused of national defamation for airing the footage without due diligence in verifying the validity of claims made . 
  ** stuart ramsay ** and the other 3 sky news crew members with him are accused of `` providing false information in matters related to national security '' ** ( staging an illegal arms trade an then notifying romanian authorities about it , is the effective equivalent of falsely calling in a bomb threat ) ** which is punishable by up to 10 years in jail . 
  ** the 3 morons with balaclavas ** are already under arrest for forming a criminal conspiracy and misuse of firearms and ammunitions . 
  ca n't seem to find it again .
