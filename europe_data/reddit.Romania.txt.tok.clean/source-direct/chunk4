   romania 's first period of deflation since the fall of communism deepened as low oil and electricity tariffs kept price growth subdued despite the waning effect of a reduction in sales tax . 
   consumer prices fell 0.8 percent from a year earlier in july after declining 0.7 percent the previous month , the national statistics institute said wednesday in an e-mailed statement . 
  the median estimate in a bloomberg survey of 10 economists was for a 0.7 percent drop . 
  prices decreased 0.2 percent from june . 
   the deflation figures are unlikely to surprise the central bank , which said this week that price declines in the european union 's second-poorest member would persist for longer than it had initially forecast . 
  monetary-policy makers kept borrowing costs unchanged at a record-low for a 10th meeting last week , predicting inflation will only return in 2017 . 
   `` inflationary pressures are likely to remain weak in the short term , '' eugen sinca , a bucharest-based economist at erste group bank ag , said in a note . 
  `` however , one should n't overlook that weak inflationary pressures at present are mainly related to transitory factors , like the reduction of administered prices for energy before elections and lower oil prices . 
  as some of these effects could vanish in the future , inflation is likely to join an upward trend in late-2017 and 2018 . ''  the leu strengthened 0.1 percent to 4.4563 against the euro at 12:35 p.m. in bucharest . 
  it 's this year 's third-best performer among eastern european currencies tracked by bloomberg with a gain of 1.5 percent . 
   food prices rose 1.25 percent from a year earlier in july , while non-food items dropped 2.2 percent and services costs declined 0.9 percent , the institute said . 
  there were no legal consequences soy why would his sacking be justifiable ? 
  if what he did was that bad , he 'd have gone to jail for 3 months or something .

  if you look at how we piss on each other here on reddit , you can figure it out for yourself . 
  i 'm 99 % positive , that russian financed euroscepticism and divide an conquer tactics , are what birthed that brexit you 're nursing . 
  so you tell me ... 
   winning the information war as revisionist , autocratic states like russia sharpen their use -- and abuse -- of disinformation , liberal democracies are failing to keep pace . 
  the kremlin 's use of information as a weapon is not new , but its sophistication and intensity are increasing . 
  belatedly , the west has begun to realize that disinformation poses a serious threat to the united states and its european allies , primarily the `` frontline states '' -- poland , the baltic states , the czech republic , slovakia and ukraine -- but also to western europe and north america . 
  how has russia 's pollution of the information space shaped international discourse on alliances , organizations , public institutions and mainstream media ? 
  what can be done to filter these digital toxins from our democratic system ? 
   `` winning the information war : techniques and counter-strategies to russian propaganda in central and eastern europe '' is the latest report from cepa 's information warfare initiative . 
  conducted in partnership with the legatum institute , it analyzes the impact of russian disinformation by drawing on dozens of case studies , some directly commissioned by the authors and others detailed by on-the-ground monitors . 
  project chairs edward lucas and peter pomerantsev synthesize those works and analyze the tools of russian information warfare -- overt propaganda channels as well as the political forces , civil society actors , businesses and public figures who use them . 
  the report also looks at several examples of policies russia has enacted to spread disinformation throughout central and eastern europe . 
   winning the information war concludes with a comprehensive set of recommendations -- also produced as a stand-alone report -- to defend against and ultimately defeat russia 's disinformation machine . 
   how would we keep them in places they do n't like . 
  by deaning anyone who does n't stay in his given country , any right to seek asylum in the other 27 . 
  you could also keep them centralised with money , i 'm assuming this will all crystallize in a eu funded social welfare program for all migrants , as opposed to having them apply to national unemployment wherever they end up . 
  we all have to contribute to a eu social relief fund for migrants , and have all migrants with refugee status receive an allowance , contingent on adhering to a few guidelines , such as staying where you 're placed , seeking integration by learning the local language etc. 
  that would be the case if this were the first such attack on our national issue or some foolish mistake . 
  but seeing as how this is a systemic problem with the anti-romanian tone in british media , things will have to involve diplomatic repercussions burrowing deeper in to what exactly swims at the bottom of this . 
  i hope there is at least some paragraph in one of our notoriously vague and very interpretable laws , that will allow for a criminal framing of his actions in all this , as such as to see him brought here to stand trial . 
  i 'm thinking ... 
  undermining national security , falsifying evidence , falsifying a police report , criminal conspiracy , criminal defamation , etc. 
  hell we even have some law that says ** if you even so much as attempt ** to buy a firearm or munitions , you go to jail for 3 to 5 . 
  what you do n't understand is that , we the east need to play along with redistribution , as redistribution is the key deterrent to keep migrants from coming to europe in the first place . 
  one there 's an eu wide strategy that could mean migrant 's wo n't have the certainty of ending up in a western wealthy country if they come to europe , they 'll think twice about setting off . 
  now , they can trek across borders and stop wherever they decide they want to , and no one can stop any of them from piling up in the well developed and very generous countries like germany and sweden etc. 
  but if they think that maybe they could end up 40 to a room in a disused school in bulgaria , fighting for a slice of bread , they wo n't see this european dream with the same eyes any more , and stay home . 
  i remember seeing something like every country that turns away migrants will have to pay the eu 250.000 per migrant . 
  so you 'd basically vote to empower your government to erode away what little patience brussels has left for you , after all the visegr\u00e1d group tantrums , or bleed all eu funds and then some from your already struggling economy . 
  if the brexit prooved anything , it was that frightening people with foreigners to secure powers for the nationalists , comes at the expense of the economy . 
  you 'll have some very satisfied conservatives waiting in line to apply for unemployment . 
   have these been released to the public ? 
  yes i posted the link in my other comment on here . 
   the bbc is still a point of pride i think . 
  well ... they did fuck up our beloved top gear , so ... no . 
  they can eat a bag of dicks , as well as the rest . 
  you mean middle earth ? 
   i 'm honestly not sure which side to believe well seeing as how diicot have surveillance videos of ramsay meeting with two of the acting traffickers in front of a hotel , 300 kilometres from where he told romanian authorities he was , i 'm thinking he 's caught red handed on this one . 
  i hope this leads to an investigation in to all the other romanian `` actors '' who 's romanianness was purposely editorialized in an inelegant light by these subversive perfidious albion agents . 
  i want those gipsy from `` the romanians are coming '' to come forward and say how were they recruited , by whom , for how much and what was asked of them . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/justitie/sky+news+stuart+ramsay+imagini+reactie ) the freshly released evidence of stuart ramsay meeting with the `` actors '' he hired for his staged editorial , talking casually in front of a hotel . 
  i hope his career goes to shit behind this . 
  yeah ... crime rates here dropped to a 20 year low this year . 
  we have by far the lowest gun ownership rate in europe , as well as the lowest level of gun crimes , meaning that the vatican and all the sleepy lovy-dovy scandinavian countries are more rowdy than us . 
  people hear romania they think russia ... 
  there was an interview recently about just how safe things are here , and some italian guy living in cluj was amazed at the fact that we did not have bars on ground floor windows , and that his girlfriend could go walk her dog by herself at 12-a-clock at night . 
  misconceptions about eastern europe in general is what keeps people from understanding just how peaceful things are here . 
  somebody 's been downloading the wire , eh ? 
  there are some bargains on mobile.de , but i would n't go so far as to call them a steal . 
  last year everybody laughed when rumours started to fly around the romanian community in london , that somebody was recruiting elderly gipsy in romanian villages and bringing them to london by the bus load , for the exclusive purpose of having them sleep rough and camp out in high visibility public places , as guerilla advertising meant to put up people 's noses at what the eu had to offer and why they should vote leave . 
  an odious human circus that was clearly engineered propaganda for opinion moulding and attitude implantation paving the way to brexit at the expense of romania 's public image . 
  now that i think of it , there was a gipsy family and a house full of romanian farm workers , that just happened to have moved in a couple of vacant houses on `` benefits street '' , only to be featured as the `` new element '' . 
  but it does indeed make you wonder , who else have they paid and what did they have them do ... 
  again with this misinformation idiocy ... romania joined the eu in 2007 , but unlike poland who joined in 2004 , we did not have mediate access to the labour market , meaning we could travel visa free throughout the eu but only as tourists , and we could work , but only as self employed . 
  the uk lifted this restriction in 2014 when romanians already accumulated there for 7 years since 2007 , were finally able to request a national insurance number like the poles had for 10 years by then , despite romania joining only 3 years after poland . 
  that 152.000 romanian flood , was sold to you by the leave campaign as an unsustainable number , despite them knowing full well that those 152.000 were mostly already there since 2007 and represented 7 years worth of immigrants and not a single year `` invasion '' . 
  the total number of national insurance numbers issued to eu citizens originating from romania , ** does not represent the number of actual romanians currently living in the uk !, 
  ** more than a third of those nino cards are in romania , in the wallets of various people who ** worked ** in the uk for any period of time . 
  many 18yo romanian boys , work summers in the eu to make enough for a used bmw off mobile.de , the 300 euro it costs to register it and the other 300 it costs to get your licence . 
  another sizeable category of romanian immigrants to the uk are the seasonal horticultural workers picking strawberries in the midlands . 
  those are the romanians you never see , because they live sleep and work in caravans in the middle of a field . 
  so when you hear there are 183.000 romanians in the uk , subtract 60.000 who went home already , and another 60.000 who are only there for 6 months every season and it 's not like you can see them anyway ... now try and compare the magnitude of the anti-romanian propaganda , with the actual number of romanians , and keep in mind that there are 12.000.000 migrants in the uk , 3.000.000 of which are illegal asians from the commonwealth . 
  [ they just admitted they were paid 2000 euro to act as gun traffickers , by a individual named stuart ramsay from sky news !,

  ** update : ** romanian investigators confirmed the whole thing was staged by the british journalists , ruling out any possible misunderstanding . 
  the protagonists were told what to say , how to react , and what to wear and were purposely recruited trough a romanian speaking media consultant who is a resident in the uk since 2009 . 
  stuart ramsay to be placed under official investigation by romanian authorities romanian ambassador to the uk to contact british authorities and ofcom , requesting a formal inquiry in to sky news . 
  ** update 2 : ** balaclava wearing `` gang leader '' is actually 36yo vodafone accounts manager [ pantics levente ] ( http://admin.stiripesurse.ro/media/image/201608/w620/media-147082380126143900.jpg ) . 
  official statement from ( diicot ) `` sky news chief correspondent stuart ramsay paid the alleged gun dealers eur 2,000 for their role in the feature report and provided the four romanian citizen with equipment , such as vests , and wrote the lines they used while being filmed . '', 
  ** update 3 : ** footage shown on sky news is `` second take '' apparently half way trough filming one of the 4 sky news crew members realised a microphone was defective and stopped filming . 
  ** stuart ramsay quoted saying `` no problem boys , let 's do this again from the beginning . '', 
  and then yelling `` action ! '', 
  like a hollywood director would . 
  ** also confirmed , all aspects of the scenario were decided in detail and written in by stuart ramsay while he was still in london , the details were then e-mailed to his liaison before his arrival in romania . 
  the names of those involved are csaba pantics , aurelian szanto and levente pantics , they are all ethnic magyars , including the person they rented the green off road vehicle from , and the village where filming took place has a 90 % hungarian population .

  they 're not really poachers , they 're more like poaching sherpas . 
  foreign morons come in , they pay 10k eur , and they get an all inclusive carpathian safari , and they get to shoot a bear , wolf or large deer . 
  they did fake it . 
  those morons are just `` braconieri '' ( wildlife poachers ) and those guns are the guns they make available to micro-penis survivors , who come to romania to trophy hunt bears , being that over 50 % of europe 's population of brown bears is in the romanian carpathian mountains . 
  they wo n't investigate the gun toting idiots based on the notification received from sky news . 
  if you look in the linked [ agerpres article ] ( http://www.agerpres.ro/justitie/2016/08/08/horodniceanu-despre-ancheta-sky-news-nu-excludem-o-tentativa-de-discreditare-armele-par-a-fi-de-vanatoare-10-23-44 ) you can see horodniceanu 's quote :  nu excludem niciuna dintre variante .
