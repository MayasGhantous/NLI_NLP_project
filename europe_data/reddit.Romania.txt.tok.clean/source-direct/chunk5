  we have contacted our institutional partners in the intelligence services as well as law enforcement . 
  ** we will investigate this issue , but we are not excluding an attempt at defamation . 
  it later felt like my proposing we `` strike back '' with our own documentaries about a certain scandalous national shame issue they 've been going trough since the 60s , was broadly generalising and offending people who had and would have nothing to do with us as a nation . 
  lately , i 've come to question whether or not these divisive and sensationalist editorial darts flying east , might be false flagging attempts at driving a wedge where the iron curtain used to be . 
  i think it 's better to be a bit less impulsive with the comebacks . 
  fun = = propaganda, 
  when i saw the `` head '' of that supposed `` mafia gang '' struggling to load that ak with that tiny 10 round mag , i almost laughed ... not to mention that those 10 rounders are regulation hunting mags for civilian aks , modified to semi-auto , very common with law abiding hunters . 
  they could have at least gone to the trouble to get an abs 30 round of ebay for plausibility . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dprixghpcy0 ) the video in question , where you can see what are probably wildlife poachers with legally owned hunting rifles , being passed off as gun smugglers prepared to sell guns to anyone including isis . 
  and [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wk0sn/gang_selling_ak47s_bound_for_western_europe/ ) the reddit post about it from yesterday . 
  peugeot just posted the greatest margins in europe , at ** 6.4 % ** . 
  renault is still strong at a decent 4.0 % . 
  [ you should see this . 
  ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/afghan-refugees-in-romania-crying-not-hungary-876 ), 
  well actually for some of us it 's the refugees who refuse to take our help , and not our refusal to take them in . 
  many of these people are looking to get the most out of this unfortunate thing they are going trough , and eastern europe although having grown significantly in the past few years , is less attractive to refugees in a world where western governments give them monthly allowances that exceed our medium wages . 
   why ? 
  this is why . 
  ** workforce skills are a tradable commodity just like a manufactured product , there can never be a distinction between an individual providing his services , and a company providing it 's services . 
  ** a free market economy means unrestricted access to the best profit opportunity , for both companies as groups of individuals and labourers by themselves as individuals . 
  eastern europe demolished it 's communist era factories and allowed the west to have it 's greatest growth period in history , all under the promises of western investment , western integration and western market access . 
  it 's been 26 years ... you have two choices . 
  do what you promised and pivot to high container value products and high end services and bring the manufacturing sector east like was promised . 
  do n't !, 
  and shut the fuck up about the eastern workforce getting on a plane and relocating next to the factories they were promised . 
  the west came in and took everything worth taking , to where even the tap water in bucharest is sold to us by a french company , the dutch own most of the large scale farmlands , the germans own gas and power distribution , the austrians have cut down most of our forests and there 's a cackle of british real estate developers at every turn , and a british money laundering industry in bed with our thieving politicians , not to mention all the eu funds we get , go straight to some italian company who pretends to build roads , but actually pockets 99 % of the money and paints a black streak across a hill somewhere , only to have it collapse 6 months in . 
  it seems to me that the eu did a very poor job at informing it 's 300 million western community about the insurmountable value that came from the sacrifice of the 200 million from the eastern half , who were betrayed by the west in 1944 and sold in to communist slavery for 60 years , again , so that the west could breathe the refined air of prosperity , at our expense . 
  well no more ... 
  lol finland 's is poisonous !, 
   ( i remember from braking bad ), 
  reaganomics in romania ... 
  any day now ... 
  i mean i know we were supposed to come in 2014 , but something came up and we just never got around to it . 
  but we 're definitely thinking about it , you 're in our top 30 for sure . 
  get back to us when you are standing in line for a visa to enter scotland . 
  my theory is that scandinavians are so nice and socially considerate , because being in-door societies , they adapted to an evolutionary model where millennia of scarcity of resources and deadly winters , have cleansed their gene pool of assholes , by environmental attrition . 
  i would n't describe them as `` neat ''  but they 're definitely cluttered . 
  by making it impossible for people in public administration to extort bribes , as well as making it impossible for the citizens themselves to make any such payments without there being an electronic trace of the transaction . 
  you could also argue that it would be impossible for anyone to launder money or buy properties and luxury goods without the origin of that income being clearly visible . 
  what 's he saying ? 
  it 's just how things are here , you ca n't control these expressive standards , like how the americans are on the imperial system . 
  people just started expressing prices in deutsche marks since the early 90s , and that just transitioned to euros in the early 2000s . 
  many people were circumstantially motivated to go `` in search of opportunity '' , and they were very rarely from among the upper echelon . 
  visegrad group = dollar store caucus . 
  buy gold and hide it in the woods . 
  a possible alternative would be contactless cip-on-banknote with a centralised scanning terminal at every business end , and id required for every transaction . 
  that way , we could still see the patterns , but the currency is still physical and conveys confidence and security to 99 % of all users , as well as allowing for an unprecedented advantage over criminal behaviour involving money . 
  looking at printed electronics and the polymer banknotes in canada , australia , romania etc. 
  you can already see it coming . 
  ** yes ** an ** `` independent '' ** scotland would be not only welcome but worth sacrificing and fighting for . 
  but if we 're taking about burning that candle at both ends by having a scotland still part of the uk and using the pound , the answer would have to be ... ( ** meh ... ** ) . 
  the idea of having the uk have the leverage against the eu , that comes with holding scotland economically hostage , is an absolute non starter . 
  in romania it was supposed to be adopted in 2019 , but it got postponed to an indefinite 2025 . 
  but romanians already think in euros , from rent , phone credit and contracts , car prices , real estate , large appliances , bank loans , vacations , plane tickets , electronics , services , almost everything is in eur , so much so that many people ca n't figure out the value of something expressed in ron , until they convert it 's price to euros . 
  ** i only wish that by the time romania goes euro , the euro would have gone exclusively electronic . 
  ** that would be the end of 95 % of all corruption . 
  nooo , that 's no good !, 
  they could go there as mere fanboys and then be sent back as hardened and well trained dormant cells , which could do allot more damage . 
  that guy was just an asshole , nothing like the paedophile hunters i gave as an example . 
  they can promise them whatever falls the softest on their ears , to gently push them out of that eu parliament . 
  after they no longer have influence an leverage the other eu countries will decide how an what to do and it 's not like the uk will be in any position to do anything about it then . 
  all the politicians are being unnecesaryliy understanding and nice with the pledges and promises , now when we 're al in this box along with this schroedinger brexit , because by running away from the event horizon and not activating that article when cameron first stepped foot in brussels and met with the eu officials after the referendum , they 've shown their hand . 
  hollande must have forgotten that in the past few weeks , an eu border agency was formed and it has authority over all the external borders of the union . 
  these idiots are trying to secure means by which to kill themselves and become martyrs in the process . 
  who the fuck cares if they signed off on life , the idea is to lure them in a trap if they want to get themselves means by which to take more people with them . 
  ** yes ** seven . 
  military intelligence . 
  i think doing this as a civilian is ** crazy as fuck !, 
  ** possibly illegal , and not the vanilla kind of illegal , like get tortured in an undisclosed location kind of illegal  it ca n't be a diy thing like the pedo hunters , for something like this , it would have to be a bunch of professionals with psych degrees to finesse their way in to the minds of these homicidal/suicidal assholes . 
  but the whole point is ** to hear about it !, 
  ** that 's how deterrents work . 
  they rarely bust `` pirates '' they mostly chase `` pirate ship builders '', 
  i do n't understand why is n't there an intelligence programme to bait these idiots in a honey pot scheme ? 
  should n't there be thousands of on-line agents pretending to be isis and trying to recruit `` lone wolfs '' ? 
  for example , there are [ these guys in the uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo4jsgnlmgw ) who call themselves `` paedophile hunters '' , they entrap pedos on-line by pretending to be minors , and then they shame them by publishing the encounters for everyone to see . 
  i think that after a few of these idiots at risk for radicalization would be shown on tv looking stupid as hell tying cross in to syria or showing up somewhere to pick up a gun or a bomb or some shit , and being brutality thrown to the ground by 20 swat fighters then sent on their way to at least 2 whole decades of downtime , maybe all the other morons out there would think twice about getting on the path to martyrdom , by way of fucking facebook . 
  why the fuck has n't this been going on ? 
  the whole point of eastward expansion for nato and the eu was so that you wo n't end up having to defend yourselves and your jobs ** from ** eastern europe !, 
  people keep overlooking that eastern europe has a population of over 200.000.000 , whereas russia has 144.000.000 . 
  ** eastern europe was not a fragment of the soviet union , eastern europe was the soviet union !, 
  ** edit : my first time being golded , ** thank you ** ... whoever you are :d . 
   the us justice department says it has successfully apprehended and charged the alleged founder and operator of kickasstorrents , the world 's largest and most notorious bittorrent distribution site . 
  artem vaulin , a 30-year-old man from kharkiv , ukraine , was arrested today in poland on behalf of the us , which has requested his extradition for crimes related to running the site . 
  vaulin now faces two counts of criminal copyright infringement , one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement , and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering . 
  all of the sites domains are in the process of being seized , while access to the site appears to have halted . 
   `` vaulin is charged with running today 's most visited illegal file-sharing website , responsible for unlawfully distributing well over $ 1 billion of copyrighted materials , '' wrote leslie r. caldwell , the assistant attorney general of the justice department 's criminal division , in a statement . 
  `` in an effort to evade law enforcement , vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits . 
  his arrest in poland , however , demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run , but they can not hide from justice . '', 
   vaulin is said to have distributed more than $ 1 billion in copyrighted materials  torrent sites have long held that they are compliant with the digital millennium copyright act , and therefore also protected by its safe harbor provisions . 
  because sites like kickasstorrents only allow users to provide links to pirated content , the defense goes that those sites should not be held responsible for what users do with that freedom . 
  however , authorities say vaulin 's operation often skirted takedown requests using lengthy demands . 
   when asked by hollywood movie studios or other intellectual property holders to remove links to copyrighted content on the site , kickasstorrents is said to have rejected takedown notices based on meeting an entire list of sometimes arcane and confusing criteria , writes ars technica . 
  demands included showing proof of both copyright ownership and that the content in question is in fact legally copyrighted , but kickasstorrents never appeared to indicate which one of those requests was not fulfilled when responding to notices . 
  the federal affidavit says kickasstorrents was also taking in more than $ 16 million in advertising revenue as of this year . 
  not really , and definitely not around here . 
  it 's called , oppositionally defiant personality disorder . 
  i bet most of this is like spike lee 's do the right thing . 
  british people are simply not used to 30 \u00b0 c and above , 
  romania - 621,573 ( 2011 census ) 850,000 ( estimated ) hungary - 205,984 ( census ) 394,000-1 ,000,000 ( estimated ) [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_diaspora ) i 'm really not trying to be an asshole or anything , but there 's also the issue of a third of our gipsy ( the majority from transilvania ) are hungarian gipsy who do n't speak more than 10 words of romanian . 
  if we go by language identity , the hungarian gipsy are by far the most numerous in europe .
