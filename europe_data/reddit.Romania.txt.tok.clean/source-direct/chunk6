  ( evidently excepting the 5.000.000 in turkey , if we count turkey in europe ), 
  i guess things are moving rather quickly in romania , i just saw an article saying that the median income is now 500 + eur in all major cities not just bucharest . 
  leaving aside the standing in line like some asshole for 6 hours , it costs 380 ron for the biometric , and 330 for the other one , how many of our expatiates do you presume have bothered to afford themselves the unnecessary luxury of a passport , when they can stroll willy nilly throughout the 31 countries in this neighbourhood , with just their identity card ? 
  they never count out the economic immigrants who work in other eu countries , they have a cnp ( nin ) they get added to the census . 
  that 's why i 've been saying that the leave campaign was wrong to say there are 260.000 romanians in the uk , because that 's just the number of nino cards issued to romanian citizens , however about a third of those only went to the uk for a few months to work . 
  it 's kind of a right of passage here to work the summer abroad when you turn 18 , to make enough money for a nice car and driving school costs . 
  this continues for the university students who have to work pay rent during the school year , who sometimes work summers picking strawberries or work construction , and make enough for a comfortable living nice clothes a nice phone and a laptop for when they come back to school . 
  in 20 years those gipsy who have left , will have had so many gipsy kids in those other countries , that our gipsy will seem the fewer and better ones , like the spanish gitanos are now  the gipsy are an international nomadic community . 
  the only reason there are more in the balkans is because they hid there in in the 30s and 40s when they were being chased around by the westerners who were tying to make soap out of them . 
  they got trapped on the wrong side of the iron curtain for a few decades , but that 's not enough reason for them to be associated with us as our inelegant export . 
  hungary has as many gipsy as we do , in half the size land area and population , but apart for that whole canada scandal a few years back they do n't really get that much flack about it . 
  we drew the short stick because they insisted on no longer being called gipsy or tigani/cigany , and they came up with `` rroma '' their word for `` man '' / `` human '' / `` person '' and we let it happen because we were kissing eu accession ass at the time and were in no position to come off as racially discriminatory eastern peasants . 
  now , whether they be hungarian , czech , slovak , bulgarian , croatian , serbian , polish etc , they 're all romanians in the minds of everyone who sees some of them anywhere in europe . 
  cheer up . 
  you have something like 7 times more km of motorway per capita than we do . 
  we suck at building roads . 
  i always assumed registering kids in the western countries was a clear advantage from a healthcare perspective . 
  that particular prefabricated concrete monstrosity , has 37 stairways , 750 apartments and is about 40.000 square meters . 
  thieving priests do n't command as much authority as they once did . 
  crafty cunts , 
  if they think romanians would leave the house on a sunday , just to stamp something having to do with gayness , they 're in for quite the surprise . 
  i predict a turnout of below 10 % ... very below ... , 
  might just be ... 
  actually this is not about people leaving , it 's about deaths vs new births . 
  they still count you as a citizen if you leave , up until you renounce your birth citizenship . 
  this is because there are n't as many citizens being born because young romanians are registering their offspring in western eu countries where they work , even if they plan on returning to romania in a few years . 
  real estate in romania is currently booming , with 10 % + annual yields . 
  my grandmother 's village has rds 1000mbps fiber hookups , but no sewer or gas networks  romanian priorities ...

  pfff ... ** we 're still # 1 at being shaped like a fish !, 
  no one should want that . 
  the us gives allot of power to the states themselves which is ridiculous and idiotic . 
  europe should be politically streamlined from a federal level directly down to local municipal government . 
  a european presidency and parliament , and municipal councils with a local mayor , that 's it !, 
  any form on national government is just there for influence trafficking and general thievery . 
  the uk was never meant to be a democracy without the all essential exile quotas , which were instrumental in disenfranchising the * `` less scientific social element '' * , and empowering the remarkable contributors to the advancement of british science , with resources that would have otherwise been used to finance the welfare state .

  one must tailor his reddit comments , by mirroring the target audience . 
  i could give a shit about the `` people 's brexit ''  ) it 's the xenophobic attacks on eastern europeans that bring about the fly tipping of my many opinions on here . 
  it 's not the british nobel laureates giving out laminated cards and setting fire to shops , it 's the drooling citizens of the anglia pedophile belt . 
  as such , i would hate to look back on this and think there was an opportunity to reflect this reality , that might have been missed because of lack of vigilance on my part , to project the inelegant qualities of another culture , which seems very egger to single out and harass individuals of another nationality , going on on preconceived notions about their quality as people .

  you 're a cunt hair away from africa , you can literally drive to africa in 6 hours , and you complain about 40 ? 
  romania gets 40 , 42 in the south and an average high of 36 which is imperceptibly less than what you get ... ** but we come off of -30 winters !, 
  i foresee a future loophole in which every polish and romanian already there , will be gay marring somebody every 5 years  . 
  at least none of our idiots are running away to join isis .

   davis , the secretary for state for exiting the european union , who leads the newly established ministry dismissed the idea that the uk could expel three million migrants from the eu who already live in britain . 
  speaking to the mail on sunday , he said he wanted to secure a `` generous settlement '' for both eu migrants already in the uk and for uk citizens who live in continental europe . 
  davis denied that he was using uk citizens in the eu as a `` bargaining counter . '', 
  ** if large numbers of migrants arrive in the uk ahead of brexit , `` we may have to say that the ` right to indefinite leave to remain ' protection only applies before a certain date , '' davis said . 
  ** ** `` we may have to deal with that , '' davis said in the interview . 
  `` there are a variety of possibilities . '', 
  one of those possibilities would be to allow residence only to migrants who arrive before a set date , he said . 
  ** ** brexit ` buffer ' ** unlike prime minister theresa may , davis was an outspoken proponent of brexit during the referendum campaign . 
  he has rejected forecasts that leaving the eu would cause a recession in the uk . 
  outside of the bloc , the uk would become the `` most open-market and open-minded country in the world , '' he said . 
  new trade deals would also `` buffer any turbulence '' caused by the split , davis added . 
  ** immigration still key ** the uk official vowed to take a tough line in negotiating brexit terms . 
  he also dismissed claims that the eu would refuse to negotiate before london officially triggers exit procedure . 
  `` we do n't have to do any negotiations , just find out where their interests are . 
  it 's not the same thing , '' he said , adding that london would `` know the shape of the deal '' by the time it triggered article 50 which marks the start of two years of formal negotiations .

  after what happened in america you can clearly see that the origin of the attackers is irrelevant . 
  the idiots who are susceptible to to being used like this , are a plentiful . 
  and to say the uk avoided something is to disregard the eurosceptic propaganda that lead to brexit as something other than a well orchestrated and well financed hibrid attack against both british and european interest . 
  anywhere you see euroscepticism or precursor events that lead to ultra nationalist movements , think textbook kgb undermining tradecraft . 
  i suspect the russians are behind isis and radicalising these undersexed mentally ill morons , as an attempt to destabilise europe trough pushing the electorate to eurosceptic ultranationalist solutions . 
  therefore france and the uk will always get the heavy end of this covert game because they are too of the main eu pillers and the only european countries with a nuclear arsenal . 
  when i made a comment yesterday about boris 's `` in any sense leaving europe '' comment , and pointed out they 're going for a in-between model , i got hella downvotes . 
  today the colours become even more vivid . 
  i put 55 % on the british and the japanese swapping islands . 
  why are we the only ones to get three asterisks ? 
  is that a good thing ? 
  so apparently they 're going for an in-between model where they plan to appease everyone , and are likely to end up misrepresenting both the 52 % and the 48 % ... nice . 
  80.000 ads on olx for romania 10.000 of which are for jobs outside romania mostly in the eu . 
  if the european people do n't like what their representatives in brussels give up in a negotiation with the uk , there will be protests all over europe and calling for boycotting uk goods and services .
