  its asinine to keep having these phantasmagorical expectations of a `` better deal '' , expecting theresa 's team of back slapping extroverts to come away from brussels with a ham under each arm . 
  why would an italian company be put in a situation where they have to compete in a free market environment against a uk competitor , while their tax money goes to dealing with the migrant crisis instead of further developing the infrastructure , while the uk company can just come in and profit like they own the place , whilst the uk government `` opts out '' of taking it 's share of migrants ? 
  you do n't share the burden , you do n't eat here !, 
  and there 's no cherry picking the market access to suit your economy , like asking to have access to the financial services and automotive markets as a half measure to be reciprocated with a half measure in freedom of movement for goods and labour . 
  50 % of the working population in the uk wakes up and has a job exclusivity because a customer from the continent creates demand for whatever he or she makes . 
   02/07/16 09:10:21 pm order status : confirmed 05/07/16 02:12:24 pm order status : shipped, 
  for immigrants working construction , the norm is 12h/day 6 days a week so about 300h/month . 
  for something that labour intensive you 're likely to get 4-600 eur . 
  it actually is n't , when you think about the fact that 4 out of 22 million people left for the west , and of those 4 million 99 % were young people . 
  our entire onanist generation is destroying the fertility rate and increasing profits for the cellulose industry , because of this damn internet . 
  those are carpenter positions at a facility that makes prefabricated concrete elements in dublin , and they offer free housing and transportation + a daily lunch , on top of that $ 1861 , but it does say it 's a 200 + hour a month job , so maybe that 's why there are no local contenders . 
  i 'm already seeing [ ads ] ( http://img12.olx.ro/images_mercadorro/108114010_1_1000x700_angajam-operatori-linie-productie-pentru-irlanda-cluj-napoca_rev002.jpg ) on romanian websites , for factory workers needed in ireland . 
  there seem to be [ more of them ] ( http://img05.olx.ro/images_mercadorro/61583446_1_1000x700_dulgheri-irlanda-urgent-cluj-napoca_rev001.jpg ) nowadays . 
  it 's looking like it , and i bet that 's why boris got out so gracefully after gunning for pm as hard as he did these pasts months . 
  teresa will get nothing but doors shut in her face in brussels if she tries to negotiate anything before actually filing that art. 50 , and then come back home with some plot line that leads to a general election , that 'll see boris on the throne whit no actual brexit , just a brexit man as a frontrunner with a brexit kind of attitude in talks with the eu . 
  lets give them some credit over there , i mean after all , they are a ** parliamentary ** democracy and the herd has never been known to lead the shepherds . 
   the owner 's 23-year-old daughter , andreea ** abraham ** they might be romanian jews , which makes this a disheartening throw back to 1930s germany . 
  social democratic party ( sdp ) would be like partidul social democrat ( psd ) in romania , which is renowned for being the moscow connection , populist public funds dilapidation strike team . 
  their roster is basically a nomenclature of the most odious communist thieves that ruined romania since the 90s . 
  romanians have used visa free travel to work in construction in europe since 1990 the point was to stop immigrants from taking british jobs , whereas blocking work access but allowing tourism , means they go there with a selfie stick and sun glasses and are on a job site in two hours , working illegally for cash in hand . 
  so then probably romania would vito your bullshit hopes and dreams of a better deal . 
  there were many attempts at informing your less sophisticated electorate about the numerous advantages of being in in a political union . 
  you chose to do the xenophobic world wide shame thing instead . 
  we 're good either way . 
  have fun watching your leaders grovel . 
  leverage to hold against an outsider is just one of them . 
  canada just buckled and gave in to visa free entry for romanians , because their precious trade deal with the eu was in our hands . 
  learn from their journey . 
  as long as they keep the draw bridge open for tourism , there will be eastern europeans working there . 
  the only thing they do by over bureaucratising the labour market , is promoting yet another incentive for tax evasion . 
  you think local businesses , whether they be construction agriculture or whatever , are going to put up with their ridiculous laziness , salary demands and propensity to unionise and go on strike every two weeks , when they could get 10 skilled `` tourists '' to do it hassle free and for half the pay ? 
  there 's a reason those unemployed people were overlooked in favour of immigrant workers . 
  the culture of entitlement and system scamming over there , is so extensive that it 's become simply incompatible with any ambitions taught of by some nationalist politicians . 
  their hopes to build a better future is severely flawed in that its conjured up from the assumption the people there would want to build it , when in fact they all ventured down this path under the assumption it would all be built for them . 
   not saying it 'll turn canary wharf into a craphole they can make some swanky lofts out of it . 
  i remember many were complaining about lack of decent housing because of the immigrants . 
  it 's total , look at the graph in the article . 
  ant those are 7 years worth of romanian immigrants , because romania became part of the eu in 2007 and was only allowed access to the labour market in 2014 , so many got there as 90 day tourists and worked without paperwork , until 2014 when everybody already there was able to apply for a nino card so they all sorted out their situation in the 2014-2015 time period making it look like there were that many in a single year . 
  i 'm not seeing a contrary argument here , so i 'll try again . 
  how do you as an independent nation hope to grow your gdp trough international business ? 
  what is it you hope to produce that 's not already being produced ? 
  what is it you hope to offer others that is not catered to by someone already ? 
  how is it you 're suppose to grow without challenging the contextual relevancy of bigger players ? 
  are you imagining a world in which you could sell mclarens to the americans and the chinese while ferrari and porsche lose market share over there ? 
  i think you 're desperately hopeful , and willingly ignorant about the delicate nature of global trade . 
  you seem to be omitting that the uk can not simply do economically better with other nations as trade partners , without it diminishing the position an incumbent partner to that nation you hope to court . 
  who is supposed to do with less , so as to allow you to do more ? 
  these positions of influence are very delicately woven . 
  its as if a recently divorced idiot would have divorced his wife to get to have more sex , only to find himself in a world where all the women are married already , and now all he can do is fuck himself . 
  there 's not even 180.000 of us and they made all those fucking xenophobic articles and documentaries ? 
  not to mention it 's more like 120.000 because many applied for nino cards to work there for a few months and then came home . 
  you do understand an economy could collapse in 90 days right ? 
  that 's how long it takes to default on mortgages and business loans . 
  you ca n't have yourselves a 5 year social experiment , on an empty stomach . 
  that 's nothing ... we had a romanian princess arrested for organising and hosting ** dog fighting ** , also in the u s of a  ), 
  i hope they get freedom of movement for that billion `` highly skilled workers '' . 
  gypsies are not romanians , if they were jews from romania no one would be speaking about them as romanians . 
  gypsies are an international nomadic community . 
  the ones from romania are from romania simply because their grandparents came here shortly before the second world war ** from all the other european countries ** . 
  just because they got trapped in here with us by the iron curtain , for 51 years since 1948 to 1989 , does n't make them ours to outsource !, 
  are we now supposed to be held responsible for the inelegant actions and lifestyle of a separate `` international '' culture , because we allowed them refuge when they were fleeing being made soap out of ? 
  are we blaming all the brits for the actions of jihadi john ? 
  are we blaming the french for their french born middle eastern origin terrorists and the paris and brussels attacks ? 
  believe it or not , hungary and slovakia have more gipsy per capita than we do , do you have any assessment to make about their class ? 
  a few clarifications . 
   the romanian community has been one of the fastest growing in the uk , reaching an estimated 223,000 in 2015 , and more national insurance numbers were issued to romanians than any other nationality in the year to march . 
  its not growing , it was already grown in the 7 years prior to work restrictions being lifted when romanians could travel and work as self employed but were not allowed access to job market , until 2014 . 
  the numbers represent the romanians already there for up to 7 years , and not a single one year `` invasion '' as presented in the media . 
  the office for national statistics numbers for national insurance numbers issued to romanians is not a reliable indicator of how many romanians there are in the uk . 
  the real number is at least a third less , because many romanians applied for national insurance numbers to work there as seasonal workers , in the horticultural industry , but have since returned to romania whilst still being featured in the official numbers . 
  there are many students who work at least one summer in the uk picking strawberries and asparagus etcetera , as a way to make a lot of money in a few months , to afford rent and living costs in the larger romanian cities where they frequent a university , this practice enables them to focus on their studies without having to keep a job during the school months . 
  we have a lot of wallets in romania , containing nino cards , that have not been in the uk for more than 4-6 months and are not likely to return again . 
  there should be a system that imposes periodical renewal of status . 
  victim ? 
  well i suppose being the victims of unreasonable treatment by misguided and misinformed cold war era pencil pushers , now turned policy makers , could constitute victimization . 
  well that would be a very unpopular opinion to have nowadays , considering everybody is almost 12 % poorer because of the plummeting pound . 
  what constitutes a `` sexual attack '' though ? 
  could this have been some over zealous grabassery perpetrated by some drunken morons , or are we taking about actual rape ? 
  ** not trying to offend . 
  genuinely inquiring . 
  germany is smart  why pay eastern workers 1700 eur when you can rebuild said decaying infrastructure with people who would work for room and board ? 
  had this been on the guardian ... maybe . 
  but the telegraph is/was viscerally in favor of leaving . 
  they 're `` willing '' to no longer look at us like we 're second class europeans ? 
  god bless us everyone !, 
  ** manufacturing companies wo n't stay or invest in britain because the working class people have a propensity to unionize and strike for every ridiculous reason imaginable . 
  ** companies get advised by british consultancy firms to avoid hiring a majority of `` locals '' for this most specific reason . 
  they also only invest in places with access to immigrant workers for this same reason . 
  this underbelly is limited to the `` lower class '' it 's not a national thing , the goldman sachs group have no such issues with their employees . 
  i think britain needs to crack down on unions , like america did in the 80s , and admit to themselves that this is very much their own creation , and not that of workers from eastern countries . 
   a flight from timisoara to bucharest costs a lot more than a flight from timisoara to london . 
  not any more . 
  cluj - luton 29 eur cluj - bucharest 22 eur * for the 6 am flight on 22.07.2016 wizz air, 
  its those damn australians who wo n't print us [ our plastic money ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up6qh0ozj_4 ) fast enough . 
  you could be neighbours with prince charles in valea zalanului for about 50.000 pounds . 
  ca n't do that in the uk ... 
   no one should enter in the next 10 years . 
  these are subtext darts  ) she 's basically saying , if you leave to save face and plan to negotiate yourselves a way back in in 4 years or so , you 're fucked , because fuck you for doing this . 
  my understanding is that this was a trap from the very beginning . 
  apparently there are two flavours of referendums , one is compulsory and legally binding , and the other is the vanilla kind like they just had , which is basic an opinion poll , that leaves the decision up to the representatives in parliament , giving that they 're a `` parliamentary democracy '' .
