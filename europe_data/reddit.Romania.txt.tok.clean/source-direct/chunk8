  they were basically given the practice dummy to see what they do with it , and now that they 've fucked it , it needs cleaning at most , but the real thing has n't even been touched or in any danger this whole time . 
  it 'll be interesting to see how they flip this around , but since cameron came out nr .10 and quit on the spot , without waiting to do so after meeting with brussels and activating art. 50 as he was supposed to do , and what everyone was expecting , its pretty obvious what 's going on here . 
   as he left his car in a parking lot , he motioned toward two romanian women sitting on the sidewalk next to bags of recyclables , surreptitiously begging for change . 
  i 'm growing very fascinated with this new superpower some people seem to have in determining somebody 's nationality by just looking at them  ) those women i 'm assuming were rroma and therefore could have been slovak , hungarian , bulgarian , czech , polish , serbian , albanian , greek , macedonian , croatian , slovenian ... etcetera i think i 's because in their vindaloo part of the world everybody who looks the same comes from the same place . 
  i also find it ridiculous to hear pakies and `` slumdog millionaires '' referencing how their gipsy cousins are `` rummaging trough bins '' when their entire country is basically a sovereign land fill and each and every one of them has relatives back there eating something from a garbage pile , right now , as i 'm sitting here writing this . 
   what a world we live in ... 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uclhtvfex6vhg-l7m_vhbubq ) 's a youtoube channel that two romanian guys set up last year , documenting their ongoing british job market adventure , beginning with work as warehouse staff in birmingham . 
  it 's by far the most accurate introspection about average romanians in the uk , and about as far as possible from the channel 4 depiction of romanians as rroma . 
  the eu sees people as social capital . 
  so if a british bank is to be allowed to invest it 's capital in a foreign economy to make a profit , so should a british citizen be allowed to invest himself in a foreign economy and profit . 
  ** ( it costs the uk 250.000 in education spending to put a single citizen trough to high school , so when an engineer from another country comes to the uk , you can reason he 's investing at least a million in the uk economy ) ** free movement of capital means every company can seek the best opportunity to make the most profit it can , regardless of where that is in the free market territory , then people should also be allowed to seek the same thing . 
  the idea is not exclusive to the academic level , it also applies to the lower social branches , like the working class . 
  its purpose is to maximize the contributive potential of every eu citizen and company , therefore conveying limitless access to emancipation growth and prosperity for everyone . 
  for example , if a bunch of eastern europeans go to the west midlands to pick strawberries , they empower the local entrepreneur with their value as workers , together with him turning a patch of dirt in to a productive enterprise , that is actively contributing to the economic momentum of our european economy . 
  whereas if they were to be kept from this platform for cooperation , the eastern europeans value as workers would be wasted in eastern europe on para economic subsistence level agriculture , and the entrepreneur from the west midlands would be sitting on a piece of worthless dirt , claiming income support . 
  i hope you can somewhat understand the value and mechanics of allowing as many partnerships as possible to form , between as many individuals as possible , or 508 million in our case . 
  i 'd like to know if you find this comprehensible .

  we 've got 9 out of the 15 cities with the fastest internet in the whole world www.romania-insider.com/broadband-internet-romania/ this is from 22 apr 2015 , when the 2016 figures come in , they 'll show almost 20 % growth . 
  we 're being held back from the official title of # 1 because of the lower speeds in our numerous rural communities , but as far as cities go , we 're on top . 
  but this is dangerous ground for democratic structures . 
  look at this referendum , and tell me what do you do when the comfortable constitute an electoral majority and can establish the course of your life , according to their needs to stay comfortable . 
  equal vote should mean equal contribution . 
  there is no encouragement . 
  they 've tried everything and nothing works . 
  the greatest challenge in modern times is to promote a social atmosphere where people and economies grow out of a profound desire to climb the social latter . 
  but complacency wins every time , once they get to a comfortable enough place , they just plop a deuce and wallow in it blaming everybody else for the smell . 
  ** populism = sanctuary and camaraderie for the unremarkable human garbage . 
  ** as an ideology its a resource for justifications and ego gymnastics where people who 's lives are shit , despite the being surrounded by access to opportunity , are now helped in to thinking their circumstances are as a result of ( * insert populist argument here * ) . 
  having a points based system only means letting al the indians and pakistani come in on fake documents they can buy for # 20 over there , saying they 're all brain surgeons , while eu applicants get bumped . 
  if you want to control immigration how about you start by sending back the millions of vindaloo commonwealthers that came there on student visa in the 90s , and never left . 
  you expect to keep your jobs that are related to 50 % of your exports to us in the eu , but only want share your work opportunities with the 9 million non eu jihadi john ethnic variety , and have the audacity to bitch to us about our 2 million , living working and integrating there ? 
  there is no access to this market without complete freedom of movement !, 
  if you do n't like it go sing at the next table . 
   there is a feeling that we are being smothered and worse that we are being replaced with cheap non unionised workers . 
  i have a friend who works at a uk based recruitment company , and i asked her , why do they keep recruiting people from eastern europe , if everyone there is racist and hates them . 
  and she said it 's basically because every company that plans on operating some facilities in the uk , is advised by consultants to avoid hiring a majority of `` locals '' because they have a propensity to unionise and go on strike for every ridiculous reason imaginable or quit without giving notice and possibly come to work for a short while then start dragging their feet to get fired so they can go back to income support . 
  she said that 's why they 're advised to mix the workforce with at least 50 % immigrants , who are , in their view , much more obedient and hard working . 
  she also said they simply wont build anything anywhere they do n't have access to foreigners and that the senior managers have a side `` business '' in buying up dilapidated housed even as far as 100 miles from the new location of these factories and warehouses , for the purposes of renting them out to the eastern european worker for # 70 a week , averaging # 3000 a month from a house sometimes not even worth # 30.000 and on top of the # 10 a day rent they also have a fee of about # 5 - # 8 a day for transportation to and from work , by people carrier , she said that they wont even consider hiring people who do n't live in those houses and that they have to advise workers when they arrive , not to complain about conditions and rent prices , because they just wont get called up for work any more , being that they 're all on zero hour contracts at a workforce agency . 
  in all this exploitative mess , i have failed to see how the european union is at fault . 
  it sounds more like you 're being fucked over by your own people ( as is tradition ) . 
  so not so much being fucked by immigrants as , being fucked ** with ** immigrants . 
  it really looks like you have some internal laws and wealth redistribution things to sort out first , before you start blaming the eu , who ironically could have helped out in a bunch of ways by pressuring the uk to get rid of things like the zero hours nonsense . 
  now you 're stuck in there with those neo-aristocrat oligarchs , with no access to the eu court of justice and no leverage , they basically own you again like in serfdom times . 
  you 'll still get fucked , only the torture dildo actually changes , now in stead of eastern europeans , they 'll bring in commonwealth workers from places like india and pakistan . 
  `` a culture of corruption '' basically the mayor took a bribe to rubber stamp an authorisation for a concrete bunker in an old factory to be used as a night club . 
  then the corrupt piece of shit fire department pencil pushers visited the concrete death trap , as they were required by law , but only walked in to inquire about the owners and get their bribes , without even so much as casually pointing out out of an informed professional opinion , that the sound proofing in there is possibly deadly if it catches fire , like it happened with the the station in 2003 , in rhode island , something that average people knew from seeing the discovery documentary , and knowing that type of sponge sound proofing is referred to as `` solid gasoline '' . 
  not to mention that out of the 64 dead , only 28 died in the actual fire , the rest died in hospitals because of nosocomial infections as a result of hospitals using diluted disinfectants that were sometimes watered down to 2000 times what they were supposed to be . 
  the whole thing imploded recently with a huge scandal and the director of hexy pharma , the company responsible for diluting disinfectants , ended up in a car crash that left the body unrecognisable , many suspecting he faked his death , giving that everyone is almost 100 % sure he was an operative for the romanian foreign intelligence service , and that they 're all involved in a public funds dilapidation mafia that stole about 500 billion from the romanian economy in the past 26 years . 
  ( for perspective , the city of dubai cost 350 billion to be built ), 
  we took down the government last year , after that nightclub fire , with nation wide protests of about 30.000 , from a population of 20mln . 
  / u/ladadadas thank you for this  just got me a free map of the eu :d i taught i might as well get one with the uk on there , as it seems they 're limited edition now . 
  and they wonder why we 're all for the abolishment of national governments and profoundly fascinated with the idea of a federal european union . 
  it was written erroneously for profiling purposes . 
  you are being watched !, 
  dude ... seriously ? 
  the cuban missile crisis was about actual nukes !, 
  those were n't interceptors , they were short range icbms with nuclear warheads . 
  what we have at deveselu is basically a really fancy stratospheric fly swatter . 
  just like our ** defensive ** shield is a `` provocation '', 
  i 'm all for a trade deal , i want tariff free back an forth commerce . 
  what i cant get over is the uk having full access to profit here whilst restricting freedom of movement to eu citizens , despite there only being 2 million of us in a country that has a whopping 10 million immigrants from the commonwealth . 
  why should we allow you to make 50 % + of your money from us when we do n't even get 50 % access to the work opportunities you have ? 
  if you genuinely have a problem with immigration why bother us lowly 2 million ? 
  why not go after the non-eu migrants as well ? 
  there were asian heritage leave campaigners , who literally pandered to their constituency of mostly asian people , arguments like `` let 's leave so we can shut down the eu border and make it easier for you to bring more family members over from india or pakistan '' so the eu that raised you from europe 's sick man is now supposed to be at the back of the cue behind countries like india ? 
  good ... 
  i was afraid brussels would pussy out in this and go the understanding and mildly over generous route , like they seem to do about everything . 
  i was thinking that if they budge on freedom of movement but still allow them to make a profit here , we should have mass protests all over europe to demand a referendum where we get to decide what relationship the eu should be allowed to have with the uk . 
  if they used populism to fuck us , here 's populism coming to fuck them right back . 
  they do n't get to have us as customers , and only share their work opportunities with the 9 million commonwealth while our lowly 2 million europeans get harassed and called vermin . 
  they want to resolve their supposed immigration problems ? 
  before any kinds of talks of limiting eu migration , we need to see mass commonwealth deportations . 
  at least 4.5 out of the 9 million . 
  let 'em fend for themselves in the `` international opportunities '' they think will have them , and that 's of course , if we do n't get there first and with a bigger appetite . 
  ** we call dibs on that nissan factory !, 
  ** this is all because everyone is speculating that the uk will never actually file art. 50 . 
  ** things went up the second camerun stepped down without filing first and then allowing for a pro-leave successor to negotiate an eu deal . 
  the more it looks like this will play out as a staying in with more benefits , the more markets gain back ground or even exceed pre referendum peaks . 
  when you hear them talk about a `` close relationship '' with the uk , its to do with the intelligence community in both countries , that 's what the arm ecosystem and snownen 's documents were all about . 
  unremarkable people being led to believe that their not doing well in the fifth wealthiest place on earth , is somehow the fault of immigration , and not their own limitation and inadequateness . 
  [ like michael gove ruled out running for pm  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i0quwug-o ), 
  well you ** can ** be sure . 
  because if they budge in brussels , we 'll start protesting all over europe , asking for an eu wide referendum , on britain being allowed in the common market without freedom of movement . 
  and given the recent outbursts of xenophobia against our citizens living in the uk , you can pretty much figure out how that 'll play out . 
  making a forest of impaled ottomans . 
  judging by how the media is depicting them as regretful , i do n't think this is too far fetched . 
   i 've spoken to people who voted leave , and immigration seems to be highest on their list of reasons to leave . 
  despite the fact that out of the 12 million immigrants in the uk , only 2 million are from the eu and only 1.2 million of them are from easter nations , 800.000 of them from poland . 
  despite the fact that there are 1.5 million brits living in the eu . 
  despite the fact that even with all the border control in the world you 're unable to repatriate some of the 9 million indians and pakistanis , because you 're trapped with putting up with them and the jihadi john element , by the kingdom 's `` special '' foreign policy on the commonwealth . 
  it was clearly the eu at fault here . 
  that boris guy is the most odious cunt ever to have lived .
