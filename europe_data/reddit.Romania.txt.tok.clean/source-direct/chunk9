  he was the mayor of london for 8 years and was nothing but ribbon cutting for european or multinational companies that came there for all of europe , and he was celebrating the european dream in the biggest city in europe , welcoming everybody who was coming there to contribute and live from all over europe , only to come out in favour of leaving , and bite every hand that ever fed him . 
  ** if the eu was so bad , how come he has n't said a mumbling fucking word about it , while he was getting his picture taken with eastern european workers on the many job sites in london ? 
  ** russian name , turkish ancestry , british cunt . 
  yes ... but the cost to teach the neo-proletariat `` zombie apocalypse  '' such a lesson , would be insurmountably damaging to the country , or rather at that time `` countries '' . 
  i ca n't think of them allowing the unity of the kingdom to be the price in all this . 
  if they frame it as `` would you rather we break up as a nation , lose all power in europe and see companies relocate , whilst still in the freedom of movement space , like norway and the swiss , for practical economic survival reasons , because the eu ca n't / wo n't break a core principle for anyone ! '', 
  ** or ** `` let us go back to before this nightmare started in the first place '' i think the firm secessionist opposition by scotland , northern ireland , gibraltar and to a more phantasmagorical but not exactly impossible extent , `` the incorporated municipality of london '' are the ** key ** to getting the nationalists on board and happy enough about it to where they wo n't be disgruntled with the pulling back from the edge scheme . 
  i think , the taught of a hadrian 's wall check point , a united ireland , a spanish flag on gibraltar , are more than enough to `` massage '' public opinions about this , to where even the most unreasonable zombie would see value in accepting a turn around . 
  there will likely be a second chance for the british people to vote on this eu issue , but its not likely to be another referendum . 
  everything they say seems to be pointing to some scenario where article 50 never gets activated . 
  there will probably be a polarised general election in which one side will campaign for annulment , and `` stability '' . 
  they are likely to get a majority and prop up a pm who wont activate art. 50 , and justify it by invoking that the house majority democratically trumps the narrow margin referendum result . 
  rumor has it britain could n't have been part of schengen zone even if they wanted , because of security concerns pertaining to immigration from the commonwealth . 
  it was either one or the other and being that they were in the eu , they `` opted '' ( without actual choice ) to never pursue that aspect . 
  lol ... 
  try and convince easterners will ya, 
  please ... all the eu has to do is come out with a statement saying they wont entertain any more discussions with the uk for the next year , give a united front of 27 doors shutting , and the british economy would collapse in 5 minutes . 
  how come we do n't have some of these nationalist moron movements in romania ? 
  i almost feel left out , pretty soon everyone will be able to blame everything that 's wrong in their country on idiots , like the uk is doing now . 
  we 'll just be sitting here like a bunch of assholes with no excuse . 
  why is n't russia investing in a eurosceptic party here ? 
  i feel like the only kid in an english boarding school that 's not getting molested . 
  what 's so wrong about us ? 
  wikipedia 's definition of `` tribute ''  ** `` in case of alliances , lesser parties may pay tribute to more powerful parties as a sign of allegiance and often in order to finance projects that benefited both parties . 
  the mighty empire on which the sun never sets , is now ** hoping to be allowed ** to pay tribute to the european union . 
  so which is the `` empire '' here ? 
  i agree with this . 
  i think people still do n't realise how powerful the european union is . 
  to put things in perspective , in about 90 days from now , the greatest empire ever in existence , an empire on which the sun never set , will humbly pull out a chair at a very unassuming table in brussels , praying to god for the opportunity to be allowed to pay ** tribute ** . 
  i 'll take it !, 
  romania did it first , 
  but do n't you agree that powerlessness in having a say would be a very effective motivational tool in mobilizing everyone as such as to dissolve that supposedly disadvantaged demographic ? 
  in practice , this would have to be upheld by a legal framework that devices social benefits as zero interest loans , to be paid back in installments immediately after regaining employment . 
  failure to return those funds should be considered community theft and the now perpetrator of social benefits fraud should be forcefully employed in a community development project having to do with civil engineering projects or any impactful development , in the inters of the community , as opposed to the current community service obligation such as street sweeping or other menial activities . 
  far from it ... but not for lack of trying . 
  the empathy is the very existence of the social welfare state . 
  the solution is simple actually . 
  income dependency should mean disenfranchisement . 
  no value no vote . 
  the greatest challenge of modern macro economics , is motivating the individual to seek personal evolution in whichever form they should desire . 
  but the establishment can only provide access to prosperity , it ca n't eat for the hungry . 
  evidently some find value in the social identities available with the jobs in those communities , enough so to where they sacrifice comfort , health and dignity to get to embrace and cherish opportunity , that no one there already seems even remotely willing to seize . 
  what makes these people like they are , is a culture of entitlement , alongside an oppositionally defiant attitude toward anything that challenges their comfort or in any way confronts them with the the idea that their circumstance is the result of their own shortcomings . 
   claiming that everyone are better of because immigration is just ridiculous . 
  like for example this kind of immigration just makes life worse to natives who work in low paying jobs . 
  they just ca n't compete with immigrants who are ready to work for lower salary and worse working conditions . 
  and i was enlightening you to the fact that most are actually better off because they benefit extensively from the buy to let scheme where the basically become property or portfolio owners in 10-15 years on the back of hard working immigrants . 
  yes they work in low paying jobs , but it costs them 50 % of everything they make just to be there . 
  do you really actually `` have '' sovereignty when you have to pay for it ? 
  even if they leave , they have to pay tribute to the eu . 
  and being that they were an empire once , this will be beyond humiliating . 
  these sort of insults demand to be made with a link to some verifiable information . 
  except of course in proposing it 's mimicked incompetence . 
  they never really wanted nor expected to leave , now they 're all grovelling for the escape hatch . 
   have you looked at the reasons why immigration affects low income areas more than middle and upper income areas ? 
  no but let me guess . 
  delusions of entitlement , laziness , and frustration over no longer being able to extort local employers with striking . 
  let 's face it , there 's absolutely no argument you can bring in defence of people who despite being born in insurmountable access to opportunity , as evidenced by the immensely successful majority , in a country with the best universities in the universe , with extensive social protection , free healthcare etc. 
  yet somehow inadequate in competing in the job market against a malnourished immigrant who had to learn a new language to get to eat what you throw away . 
  i 'm sick and tired of these populist ego circumventing excuses . 
  you 're not doing well in the fifth wealthiest country on the planet is do to your own limitations and inadequateness !, 
  there is no sanctuary for the unremarkable in the modern world . 
  either you work hard or somebody comes in in works hard in your stead . 
  keep in mind that eastern european immigrants live in ** buy to let ** properties , basically a type of mortgage where you pay an advance and use the rental income to pay the mortgage . 
  if the 2 million eu migrants in the uk leave tomorrow morning , the uk economy collapses in september and brings the world with it , because it would mean 300.000 properties defaulting on their mortgage . 
  adjusted per population it would be the equivalent of what happened in the us in 2008 , ** only 40 times worse **, 
  so why has n't the sky fallen down in italy and spain where there are a million romanians in each and probably another million east europeans from other eastern countries ? 
   i am so sick of medias presenting uk like it 's a 3rd reich . 
  there 's method to this madness . 
  this is all happening to discredit leavers and pave the way to the great october fakeout , when they plan to find a way to stay in the eu and do so with public support . 
  i agree whit that . 
  you can actually see how juncker is actively trying to rub their nose in shit , by forcing them to activate art. 50 basically they were trying to extort the union with this referendum , now they 've shit the bed and everyone in brussels is trying to make them pay dearly . 
  hopefully , egos will subside on both sides . 
  unfortunately these `` interesting people '' are gon na keep fucking us sideways , until we get our shit together and form a european central intelligence agency . 
  the consensus now is to let them fuck us because it 's costing them allot of money and its further crippling their economy with adventurous divide and conquer bullshit dreams . 
  evidently as of friday morning this kind of thinking is dead . 
  we 're about to see populism and nationalism take a real hit around here . 
  which was sold as horse from romania and bought as horse by an ** austrian ** company , who changed the paper work and sold it as beef . 
  this has a purpose in sending a message , but it wo n't happen because it does n't need to . 
  hearing cameron yesterday you could hear the subtext of how they plan on getting out from under this . 
  they plan on collapsing the government in protest and therefore forcing general elections in october , and the campaign of these elections will be on staying in for both tory and labour who will form a majority with a pro european pm who 's first job will be to annul the referendum and say that they won campaigning on annulment and therefore justify their majority as democratically in favour of staying , and then blame the referendum on xenophobia and misinformation and view it as a vote of protest against the political class as a whole , and not as anti european . 
  even if you look at how the media is playing this , you can clearly see it 's far from a celebration . 
  brexit voters are made to look like senile yobs and the ones that are n't are shown as regretful . 
  because all euroscepticism is financed by the kremlin . 
  that crocked mouth of his ended up like that from eating too much mongoloid dick cheese . 
  he used to work in finance and was part of the first generation of money launderers for the kgb . 
  he 's also married to a german woman who has family in east germany and is very likely a kgb operative herself . 
  the hungarian ukip , the eurosceptic party `` jobbik '' , was founded by a man named b\u00e9la kov\u00e1cs who was [ uncovered ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hungarian-far-right-party-politician-accused-being-kgb - spy-1467498 ) to be a 20 year veteran kgb agent who was married to woman who was also married to a japanese nuclear physicist at the same time . 
  she 's also from east germany . 
   it 's in the name , it has one goal and it achieved it well ... it looks like they do n't keep shit actually , because scotland , northern ireland and gibraltar all want to leave the kingdom . 
  the day when westminster activates art . 
  50 , the united kingdom becomes the half island nation of welsh-anglia . 
  ** so how the fuck are they suppose to have a united kingdom independence party , with no united kingdom ? 
  ** if anything , what they actually achieved , is to ** disunite ** the kingdom , and quite effectively so . 
  ** they should go by dkip from now on . 
  well that must mean you 're one of the 2 million cunts getting paid from the national budget . 
  that 's you 're bullshit troll nonsense . 
  romanians want complete federalization and standardization of social services and all bureaucracies at a pan european level . 
  the eu needs to take itself more seriously and get allot more involved in the lives of eu citizens . 
  this european by national proxy bullshit does n't work .
