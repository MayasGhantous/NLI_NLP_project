you just described racism , congratulations . 
  and then people like you get pissed off when others generalize about romania !, 
  no , those are the roma ( gypsies ) . 
  nope , it 's a joke about the device that does something else rather than what it was designed to do . 
  ( and i 've heard it with various vegetables . ), 
  i know a romanian version of this . 
  ` what is big , makes a lot of noise and cuts carrots in 3 ? 
  the romanian cut-carrots-in-5 machine . ', 
  two of my favorite films are [ l'auberge espagnole ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283900/ ) and its sequel , [ les poupees russes ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409184/ ) . 
  a local film i really liked is [ amintiri din epoca de aur ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1422122/ ) . 
  i do n't usually watch romanian movies , but this one was funny and it brought back a lot of memories . 
  they both pretended to be leading experts in everything . 
  his wife was a chemist and my grandma worked with her once upon a time ; of course if you did any kind of research in chemistry , you had to add elena ceausescu as an author , even though she had n't contributed with anything ... so she had tons of published papers . 
  the sad thing is that i hear young people saying this too . 
  i can understand it coming from the older generation , but from 25 year olds ? 
  the comments on that post make my brain hurt . 
  yes , i would like to be locked in my own country , have to queue from 3 am to get a bottle of milk and go to jail because a relative of mine escaped to a different country !, 
  but hey , it 's fine since the state gave you a house !, 
  ( for the record , my parents had to buy theirs , and after the communist regime fell they saved up and managed to buy a second , bigger apartment . ), 
  life is n't as shitty here as some people try to make it sound . 
  yes , some have it bad , but i 'm sick and tired of the `` boo hoo , romania is such a shithole and it 's impossible to have anything good here ! '' . 
  well , you can leave if it 's such a shithole , the borders are open and you can work almost anywhere in the eu . 
  go pick strawberries if that 's what you can do , get a job with a multinational if * that 's * what you can do . 
  no one 's forcing you to work for 50 years in a factory anymore . 
  and the thing that pisses me off the most : the people who complain have no clue whatsoever about what 's going on in other countries !, 
  they 've never set foot anywhere else and they think western europe is the promised land . 
  well , like my boyfriend 's cousin found out , just because 900 pounds sounds like a lot of money for a romanian , in england it means you wo n't afford anything and you 'll come back in 3 months poorer than you left . 
  / rant over, 
  i am very happy that my parents decided to pierce my earrings when i was too young to understand . 
  i would be too scared to do it now ... 
  most of the people i know ( romania ) have pieced their children 's ears and i do n't see the problem . 
  it 's usually done at the hospital right after the child is born . 
  it 's pain that lasts a few seconds and if you do n't like the holes , you can let them close by themselves . 
  i do n't understand why someone would want to ban this ... 
  by the way , is n't calling it `` fresh milk '' wrong ? 
  i mean , fresh milk is what you get from a cow . 
  you need to boil it straight away otherwise it goes bad . 
  pasteurized or uht , that 's not fresh anymore ... 
  i will investigate next time i 'm in a supermarket , because i 'm really curious now . 
  also , for the record , the taste of milk ( of any type ) is disgusting :p my parents always tried to give me milk when i was a kid , but it almost made me throw up , bleh . 
  especially when it cooled off and got caimac ( sorry , do n't know the english word ) . 
  i tried milk straight from a cow and it was very , very slightly better , but i still wo n't drink milk by itself . 
  with coffee or hot chocolate it 's great . 
  ok , i 'm confused . 
  i thought all the milk in romanian supermarkets was uht . 
  i saw a couple of `` fresh milk dispensers '' , but i do n't trust that milk honestly . 
  can you give me some examples of uht/pasteurized ? 
  i 'm guessing the milk that comes in plastic bags is pasteurized , and the milk that comes in cartons is uht ? 
  on topic - uht , because it lasts for ages and i never run out of milk the morning i do decide to have coffee . 
  i have friends in vienna and they sometimes speak in a dialect that sounds very weird to me . 
  i do n't know german , so i never understand anything anyway , but this dialect has different sounds compared to the `` standard '' german they usually speak . 
  i have no idea what it 's called , they just call it `` dialect '' . 
  the only dialect word they use mixed with regular german sounds like `` gael '' and means `` cool '' ( it 's probably not spelled that way ) . 
  i 've heard dutch and spanish and the `` hhhh '' sound does not seem the same to me . 
  in dutch it 's like a cat spitting out a large hairball . 
  in spanish it 's a harsher `` g '' ( or , well , a harsher `` h '' for me , actually ) . 
  the will smith song , palm trees , beaches and girls in shorts and rollerblades ( this might be from the music video ... ), 
  fubu was something i aspired to , but never owned !, 
  the economy was shit back when my mom went to france , so she could n't afford something as fancy as a hoodie . 
  i do remember some kids at school with fubu t-shirts and they were the coolest . 
  uk : drunk women puking in ditches france : good wine , croissants , rude , bad english speakers netherlands : holland . 
  always high . 
  hungary : trying to steal transylvania russia : too close for comfort , already stole basarabia from us bulgaria : romania 's somewhat poorer little sister spain : this is where we gather strawberries germany : source of cheap bmws , only 100.000 km , driven by the manager 's personal driver , stellar condition ( until the motor falls out ), 
  probably somewhere in southern spain . 
  i like the weather and i know the language already . 
  not having freezing cold winters would be so nice !, 
  if the socket seems loose , i will hold it , otherwise i wo n't . 
  i 'm early 30s in romania , so bad electrical installations were definitely a thing in my childhood . 
  roumania or rumania . 
  it 's very , very old spelling and it just rubs me the wrong way . 
  i 've lived in bucharest my entire life and i ca n't argue with anything you said . 
  budapest is clearly superior . 
  it is !, 
  i can pronounce the rest of the sounds decently , but the ` r ' , geez . . no . 
  i am not the same person , but my brother was super cool with his chicago bulls cap in the early 90s . 
  i actually think our mom bought it from france !, 
  being from a poorer country ( and older than the average redditor ) means my answer will be boring : the only time i took a school trip outside romania was when i finished university ( 2004 ) and it was just to the bulgarian seaside . 
  i did go on school trips before that , but it was just inside the country . 
  i finished school before romania joined the eu , so travel outside the borders was difficult ( visas etc ) in addition to expensive . 
  in bulgaria we went to albena and we did what people do at the seaside : go to the beach , swim , go to the disco , drink . 
  i do remember that the bulgarian seaside was ahead of the romanian one at that point - they had a lot of activities ( parasailing , jet skis ) and the touristic area was very animated . 
  getting your hair braided with little plastic beads was very popular and i still love how those braids looked on me . 
  piggybacking onto your reply ... 
  there 's a t-shirt company who has an entire collection based on romanian idioms translated to english ( https://ruvix.ro/categorie-produs/tricouri-romgleza ) . 
  i 'm gon na explain a few . 
  * `` a plimba ursul '' - `` to walk the bear '' - to go away . 
  usually said in imperative to someone you do n't want to see/talk to anymore . 
  * `` a fi praf '' - `` to be dust '' - to be very bad ( at something ) . 
  * `` a calca pe bec '' - `` to step on the light bulb '' - to do something wrong . 
  `` a bate campii '' - `` to beat the fields '' - to ramble on about something incorrect and/or boring . 
  * `` tufa de venetia '' - `` venice bush '' ( the plant ) - someone who is completely clueless about something . 
  usually used in a school context - `` i am a venice bush when it comes to math '' . 
  * `` a taia frunze la caini '' - `` to cut leaves for dogs '' - to laze around , to not do anything . 
  very similar to `` rubbing the mint '' . 
  * `` in puii mei '' - `` in my chickens '' - for fuck 's sake . 
  `` puii '' is an euphemism for `` pula '' ( dick ) , because they both start with the same two letters and you can switch words midway if you are in polite company , but want to keep the meaning of the phrase . 
  the rude version is `` in pula mea '' , which means `` in my dick '' . 
  - `` what my feather ? '', 
  - what the fuck ? 
  again , `` pana '' is an euphemism for `` pula '' .
