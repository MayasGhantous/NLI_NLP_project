  even as it stands , eu 's budget is at 1 % of the combined member states gni . 
  i 'd advise to take everything / u/paludosa2 says with a huge grain of salt as he 's extremely biased . 
  he 's not after objectivity with reliable sources , more after shouting ukip agenda . 
  it 's as if he 's paid to push that agenda with a daily quota of link and comments . 
  you can always count on him , even in this moments of acute crisis for europe that can push us on the brink of another huge recession ( if economic sanctions will take effect , which i think is the case ) , to ignore the big picture and focus on drumming up ukip agenda . 
   ed pilkington reports from the emergency un security council meeting that vitaly churkin , the russian diplomatic representative at the un , has just shown the other members of the council what he claimed was a letter from viktor yanukovich , the ousted president of ukraine who is now in exile in russia . 
   in the letter , the former leader of the troubled country calls on the russian president vladimir putin to use his military to invade parts of ukraine . 
  churkin reads :  `` as the legitimate elected representative , i say the events in kiev have resulted in ukraine being on the brink of civil war . 
  the rights of people in crimea are being threatened . 
  under the influence of western countries , there are open acts of terror . 
  i would call on the president of russia , mr putin , to use the armed forces of the russian federation to establish peace and defend the people of ukraine . ''  samantha power , the us ambassador to the un , has just taken the floor with this acerbic riposte : `` so many of the assertions made this afternoon are without basis in reality '' . 
  it 's like we 're in a bad action movie . 
  it converts to the local currency , which for uk is the pound . 
  ( . co.uk ) for . com it [ converts to dollars . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=96+euro+in+proper+money&amp;cad=h ) ukraine was just invaded by russia and you mock the euro from uk . 
  get your priorities straight . 
  you really need to provide a source for the claim that chevron did not have the right to build a prospecting well and additional infrastructure on that land . 
  because i highly doubt that 's the case with all the public scrutiny involved around the issue of fracking . 
  private property on a leased land is still private property . 
  that protest turned violent , the protesters destroyed chevron 's fence and hailed it as a victory . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ec0d9i9s ) . 
  even if you claim that there 's corruption behind how the town hall leased the land to chevron , the gendarmerie were legally obliged to intervene and defend private property . 
  i took part in numerous unauthorized protests last summer that blocked road traffic and was never arrested . 
  each protest march was finished by a sit-in at a crossroad in the city center , in effect blocking the traffic for an hour , and we still did not get arrested . 
  i agree with you . 
  i always looked with suspicion to russia whenever i read news about its policies to invest a lot in military but somehow dismissed it as them having to protect a lot of land with a somewhat heterogenous population in a couple of regions . 
  it never crossed my mind they are keen on invasion so close to europe . 
  it was a bit of a shock . 
  nationalist rethoric used to annex crimea reeks of ww2 similarities . 
  war is too fucked up . 
  what 's happening to ukraine resonated with normal people in eastern europe . 
  so in a sense the government is obliged to increase spending in defence . 
  i think it 's fair to say that russia just became the common enemy for europe . 
  the years to come will be crucial for eu . 
  seems like we 're exiting one crisis and plunging into another . 
  damn , the resemblance is staggering . 
  going to war on nationalistic arguments will never go well . 
  you have a very superficial understanding of the eu . 
  it 's very improbable that the uk will leave the single market . 
  even the most hardcore anti-eu party in the uk advocates to remain in eea . 
  to use your analogy , members of the eea are those groupies that hang around with cool kids but have very little to say in what the group does . 
  one of the biggest mistakes , on which everyone seems to agree , is that a common fiscal policy is needed in order to have a single currency . 
  how will britain convince other countries to accept the pound if they themselves argued to keep the currency ? 
  this is in part why scotland will not be able to keep the pound if it secedes from britain . 
  so if they are going to attempt to make a stronger union they 'll struggle with the same issues . 
  we attempt to fix issues within the eu by reforming treaties . 
   yanukovych says there should be constitutional reform by the end of the year , presidential elections in december and then a new constitution should be adopted . 
   arms need to be handed over , armed gunmen need to leave the streets and buildings and squares `` unblocked '' . 
   he says the west `` connived with the euromaidan forces '' and must bear responsibility for what has happened there . 
   he 's now stopped speaking but is taking questions . 
   yanukovych begins by saying it is high time for him to announce his decision `` to fight for the future of ukraine against those who use fear and power '' . 
   he says he was forced to leave ukraine because of the threat to his life and his relatives ' life . 
   ukraine has been taken over by fascists , representing a minority of the ukrainian people , he says . 
  from the live feed [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-taking-over-airports-live-updates ), 
   but ukraine is neither a nato member nor eu , so on what grounds would the eu militarily stand up for them ? 
  yep , that 's right : based on the un charter , maybe the nato charter ( `` regional stability '' ) . 
  i do n't think the eu will stand up militarily for ukraine . 
  but russia is going to be seen as an aggressor here . 
  no matter what the official russian stance will be on this , intelligence agencies will keep western leaders informed on what 's really going on there . 
  and this kind of sovereignty aggression will cause armies across eu to mobilize/hold drills/etc . 
  i 'd be very surprised if these militias were not russian . 
  no country would give that amount of military gear to undisciplined paramilitary militias when it aims for stability in the region , which is what russia wants until the referendum . 
  at some point they 'll be called russian peacekeepers . 
  russia is treading on a very thin line here . 
  they `` secure '' crimea until the referendum on becoming part of the russian federation takes place . 
  at some point they will have to recognize that the military units are russian peacekeepers . 
  i do n't think any country would give that amount of military gear we 're seeing to ideologically driven militia . 
  it 's a recipe for disaster and instability . 
  exactly the opposite of what they 're trying to achieve there . 
  until may i suspect eu will mobilize a lot of army at the border with russia and ukraine . 
  while diplomatic talks will take place , i believe military escalation will be the norm , as european countries take defensive positions at the border .

  what benefits does uk have from keeping gibraltar ? 
  it 's in a strategic location . 
  i 'll pose the question again , are you a ukip party member that does n't really know what he is talking about when it comes to financial markets and just drums up the party agenda ? 
  btw : third world is a term from the cold war . 
  look it up . 
  it makes no sense to use it . 
  i feel that the crisis led to a new low in the economic debate in europe . 
  populists exploit the ignorance of people with regards to the financial sector and move the debate from academia/researchers to people that ca n't grasps basic notions in financial markets . 
  the superficial analysis of financial markets with quotes from a guy in newspaper that does n't provide sources and writes an article on out of context extracts seem to be typical of the debate around economy in ukip 's agenda . 
  i do n't mind , as i understand that their target are people that have never seen a scientific paper on finance but feel that they should shape economic policy . 
  what i do mind is that he does n't disclose that he is a member of ukip ( if that 's the case ) , as i 'd know that there will be no debate if i reply , he 'll simply ignore me and drum along that party agenda . 
  full disclosure , are you a ukip party member ? 
  yes/no because you drum up party agenda constantly over here while you do n't seem to have a job . 
  / u/trucidator admitted to being ukip . 
  seconded , i 'm fairly certain that 2  3 for extremely large values of 2 . 
  as much as you 'd like to self-victimize , a different opinion is not the real reason why this thread will get downvoted . 
  it 's because you are wrong in your assessment . 
  there are days in which this subreddit reads as an eu skeptics circlejerk . 
  stay a while and listen . 
  agreed that the spark of the protests was not signing the association agreement with the eu . 
  but after berkut brutally beat protesters they turned anti-corruption . 
  you need the viewpoint of an eastern european . 
  we 're fed up with corruption . 
  the only reason why i 've lost count of the ex-ministers/ministers in office jailed for corruption in romania in the last two years is because the eu demanded independence for the justice system and set clear demands on how we should tackle the problem . 
  the national anticorruption directorate ( [ dna ] ( http://www.pna.ro/index.xhtml ) ) was set up in 2002 , during the accession talks , as an institution specialized in corrupted politicians . 
  it would have never happened if it was n't a clear demand from the eu . 
  the very prime minister that signed the law which established dna was jailed by its prosecutors . 
  as an anecdote , someone in / r/romania [ said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/1x2o0t/radu_maz%c4%83re_pus_sub_urm%c4%83rire_penal%c4%83_pentru_abuz/cf7l6sb ) that he 'll get a dna tattoo if the very corrupt mayor of constanta , [ radu mazare ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=radu+mazare&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bvghu43wg86rhqfxroggda&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1105&amp;dpr=0.9 ) , will be jailed .
