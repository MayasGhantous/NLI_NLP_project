  actually there were no deaths linked to police brutality during the occupy protests . 
  also if you check the references for that number there are :  `` man found dead in tent during occupy okla. . city protest ; police say death not suspicious ''  two deaths near occupy camps in oakland and burlington . 
   with description : a man was killed after a fight broke out close to the occupy camp in oakland , california , but it is not clear if he was a protester . 
  in burlington , vermont , a 35-year-old war veteran apparently shot himself in the head in a tent at an occupy camp . 
  i could not find a reference that links the killings to police brutality . 
  there are only 3 deaths referenced , from 32 . 
  this number is clearly wrong . 
  source for the number for occupy wall street ? 
  is n't that law pretty similar to a law against protests in russia ? 
  the part about ngo 's needing to register as ` foreign agents ' if they receive international funding ? 
  it 's funny that you call it totalitarian when news channels say it resembles a law from russia . 
  snap elections , there 's no reason to be against it . 
  it will release the pressure . 
  people are getting way to radical . 
  the political process is designed exactly for this . 
  and it 's badly needed . 
  the opposition will see exactly how much support they have in the population and perhaps further russian integration will be part of their policy , once they are in the government .

  [ theory of mind - under the sea ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qjotuv-mm8 ) we actually have a subreddit with good romanian music , if anyone wants to check it out : / r/rolistentothis, 
  it truly depends on the intern 's specialization . 
  i have a friend that started this year as an intern in morphopathology ( autopsies ) and takes ~ 1000 euros a month , mostly because of toxicity perk ( spor de toxicitate 100 % ) among others . 
  formol is very toxic . 
  shhh , do n't come here with facts , it 's generalization time . 
  we are , after all , talking about big business , big banks and big bureaucrats . 
  i 'm used to this kind of political speech in romania , where party members insult each other , call themselves liars , thieves , corrupt , and on top of it all , our prime minister blames the president on everything he fails to accomplish . 
  it degraded so low that there is not longer a political conflict on relevant issues , only calling each other names and doing very little . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that they feel no responsibility whatsoever , just shouting , be it from the sides or from the government . 
  and nothing comes out of this . 
  how did you find this subreddit ? 
  most likely you do n't even know how the eu works . 
  by generalizing evil into big companies , big bureaucrats , big business he 's actually not saying anything . 
  he 's just feeding into the circlejerk and fear-mongering . 
  a 14 year old could make that speech . 
  go to r/circlejerk and they 'll tell you all about banksters and evil corporations , evil big business and evil immigrants . 
  truth is , he 's an entertainer , a joke in the eu , he has no plan because plans are bureaucratic and we 're all up in pitchforks against that !, 
  they are payed to write laws and make reforms , but instead ukip members skip commisions , rarely go to vote , do n't draft laws . 
  basically not doing what the electorate told them to ( doing their job ) . 
  instead , he makes generalizing speeches that are meaningless to eu . 
  but then again , he posted the speech on youtube , so we know that the real reason was to drum up the ukip circlejerk and say nothing of essence . 
  i also suspect you 're actually a ukip member spamming here . 
  what do you mean by saying it was n't allowed to bring it up ? 
  it was the sole reason they went . 
  from the description :  this infoclip illustrates the visit of the ep delegation to washington d.c. , usa concerning the us surveillance programmes and their impact on eu citizens ' privacy . 
  the big difference is that only a few select countries opened the work market to poland in 2004 : the uk , sweden , the netherlands and denmark . 
  the rest opened only in 2011 . 
  for comparison , mass emigration from romania happened when spain and italy opened their labour markets to us in 2007 . 
  1 million romanians now live in spain , while 1.2 millions are in italy . 
  what happened to the uk in 2004 was similar to what happened to spain and italy in 2007 . 
  if you want to draw a parallel you 'll need to look at what happened to germany after labor restrictions were lifted for polish people , in 2011 . 
  i wonder why do you call catherine ashton corrupt and incompetent . 
  she led the negociations with iran in geneva and she is responsible for the treaty between serbia and kosovo . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-talks-lady-ashton-geneva-triumph ) . 
  it even took me less than 10 seconds to find the text on which they voted , with all the amendments and final approved draft . 
  and it 's the first time i open that site . 
  i 'm honestly amazed at the transparency level . 
  it 's densely packed with information but the structure is very intuitive for a tech savvy person . 
  i think he refers to a centralised state and culturally relatively uniform . 
  can you find the borrow rate of the eu anywhere on the internet ? 
  i think you missed my point , i never said that credit ratings are useless . 
  i 'm saying that this particular credit rating for the eu is in reality no news and useless . 
   issuing a different credit rating for 1 % budget is , in my opinion , useless . 
  because member states already have different ratings , and the amount of money is not significant . 
  i considered the other questions moot because they address technical aspects of computing a credit rating for the budget of a political union of member states , a subject on which i have no specialization . 
  on top of that , it 's 1 % of the member states so it 's hard to believe it will ever be in danger of default . 
  i maintain my view that a credit rating on eu is useless . 
  eu 's annual budget is [ 1 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union ) of the total budgets of member states . 
  as a side-note , this is why cameron 's stubbornness to decrease it with a few billion euros was silly and only for political gain . 
   a spokesman for the agency said : `` the downgrade ... reflects our view of weaker credit worthiness among the 28 eu member states , including among net creditors to the eu 's budget . 
  issuing a different credit rating for 1 % budget is , in my opinion , useless . 
  i find it really odd since the annual eu budget is just [ 1 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union ) of the combined budgets of the member states . 
  the us government was downgraded to aa + in 2011 by s&p . if we were to look at the us , as you suggest , the downgrade is great news . 
  in reality , it 's no news . 
   investors often ignore ratings , as evidenced by the rally in treasuries after the u.s. lost its top grade at s&p in 2011 . 
  yields on sovereign securities last year moved in the opposite direction from what ratings suggested in more than half of 32 upgrades , downgrades and changes in credit outlook , according to data compiled by bloomberg . 
  no one really cares about this rating , especially because :  the eu budget is financed by contributions from the 28 member states and not eu-wide bond sales , and its credit rating is based on the perceived sovereignty of its members . 
  there is little risk that the eu will not be able to access capital markets , s&p said . 
  from [ bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-20/european-union-loses-aaa-credit-rating-at-s-p-on-weaker-cohesion.html ), 
  should n't the daily mail update the article in question if they were proven wrong and even the metropolitan police issued an apology ? 
  i think you missed the countless explanations in this subreddit of what 3rd world country means . 
  it is cold war terminology . 
  look it up . 
  i can listen to the show here . 
  treaties are not put up to referendum because the heads of states dictate foreign policy . 
  if we had a constitution passed this would not have been an issue .
