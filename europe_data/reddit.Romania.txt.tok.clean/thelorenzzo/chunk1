massive , wide-spread protests did a fairly decent job though . 
  we used to way that romania has 2 good neighbors - serbia and the black sea . 
  nowadays , i guess our closest allies are moldova and bulgaria , though moldova is slowly drifting away since they elected a pro-russian president . 
  i 'd celebrate . 
  our politicians suck , the parliament is a shit-show , infrastructure projects are handled by idiots , public money is stolen like crazy by the ruling party ... 
  i do n't need sovereignity with these retards in power . 
  i 'll take merkel over dragnea , thank you very much . 
  no more exits , that 's for sure . 
  that sweet eu single market & them eu funds are way too valuable . 
  just look at hungary and poland . 
  their governments are openly anti-eu , but they are n't seriously discussing any exit votes . 
  some romanian politicians have also been critical of the eu recently , but none would dare to try pulling us out . 
  futu-\u021bi ceapa c\u0103prii m\u0103-tii = fuck your mother 's goat 's onion this one 's my favorite, 
  nicolae ceau\u0219escu in romania throughout the 80s . 
  his austerity measures and export policy made him widely hated by the population . 
  yet , he remained in power because everyone feared his regime . 
  sure , he only lasted 9 years , but only because he kept all the real power to himself and got betrayed by the army . 
  erdogan seems smarter than that and he has already taken care of the army . 
  as a romanian , i love these threads . 
  type : fiber speed : 1 gbps down / 500 mbps up price : 39 lei ( 8.6 $ ) area : urban also , from my parents ' house out in the countryside : type : fiber speed : 100 mbps down / 50 mbps up price : 28 lei ( 6.2 $ ) area : rural no caps for either of them . 
  yeah , sorry , the $ 46k probably refers to his bank deposits or salary . 
  the source does n't look very reliable though , but it 's the only one i could find in english . 
  according to romanian sources , he 's not very wealthy though - less than $ 1m . 
  * a freca menta * = rub the mint = do nothing * a da la ra\u021be * = give to the ducks = puke * m\u0103 doare \u00een pul\u0103 / cur/cot * = my dick/ass/elbow hurts = i do n't care * m\u0103 sco\u021bi din pepeni * = you take me out of my watermelons = you are annoying * a da cu mucii \u00een fasole * = throw boogers in the beans = screw ( something ) up, 
  president klaus iohannis : $ 46k according to [ one source ] ( http://muzul.com/celebrity/klaus-johannis/ ) . 
  might be higher , but not by much . 
  he also owns 3 houses and 2 apartments and made $ 20k last year from royalties on his book . 
  pm sorin grindeanu : his fortune is pretty confusing . 
  he loaned $ 40k to 2 companies , owes $ 44.8 k to a bank and sold an apartment for $ 30k . 
  his wife also made almost $ 10k by renting land . 
  they have no bank deposits .

  more than the 0 cents i 'd give to cos. 
  yes , you may start planning your takeover of the romanian air consuming market :d, 
  virtually none in romania . 
  they are not a recognized religion and probably never will be . 
  except for very few lunatics , no one will ever pay to unlock their stupid levels . 
  we 'd rather pay for air, 
  we have a populist left ( psd ) , which is even worse . 
  it 's viewed a lot better than ww2 , that 's for sure . 
  once it ended we got transylvania , bessarabia ( current rep. of moldova territory ) and bukovina . 
  these were territories with an overwhelming romanian majority that had been occupied by austria-hungary and russia for years . 
  all we ever wanted back then was to reunite the romanian population and we did a pretty good job at that . 
  our national day is december 1st because transylvania was the last region to join the kingdom of romania on this day in 1918 . 
  so yeah , history books like ww1 . 
  i have never been carded in romania . 
  ever . 
  not even when i was a child . 
  usually , people assume you buy it for your parents since you probably would n't spend 15 $ on vodka as a child anyway , given how alcohol is sold in stores that also have toys , candy and coca-cola . 
  even our own musicians sing mostly in english . 
  i actually feel weird hearing songs in romanian now . 
  i guess it 's not all that bad , since they can reach a much wider audience . 
  take inna or alexandra stan . 
  i doubt i would 've heard mr. saxobeat on british radio if it were in romanian . 
  it 's easy . 
  take a very well developed public transit system that covers almost the entire city and all small towns surrounding it , then add crazy bureaucracy and taxes for getting the car authorised to hit the road . 
  that 's how we did it in bucharest , yet it 's still the worst place to drive in romania . 
  maybe we should raise those stupid taxes even more . 
  perfectly true . 
  also , lots of money and resources were poured into gigantic projects with zero regards to safety and human lives . 
  this meant jobs . 
  jobs that could kill you though . 
  examples : [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube%e2%80%93black_sea_canal ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament ), 
  never trust internet polls , no matter which site they are on . 
  it 's incredibly easy to fake their results to push an agenda . 
  in romania , we have our fair share of nationalist-extremist sites and there are probably quite a few youngsters paying attention to them , but they barely represent small groups of people who could not integrate into society and blame their own failures on foreign influence . 
  they believe the orthodox church should have ( more ) political influence and fail to see how corrupt priests are . 
  they believe the eu ( and sometimes illuminati gets thrown in there as well as the usual jewish scapegoats ) wants to exploit them and take away their national identity , failing to see how corrupt their beloved romanian politicians are even though we have almost daily convictions . 
  if anything , we should all praise the eu for making us jail their corrupt asses . 
  first , i must clearly underline that my entire argument applies only to romania . 
  we joined the eu 3 years later than other ee countries . 
  it was never the 55 + generation that wanted it , but the people born in the 70s and 80s , who lived their adulthood in democracy and could appreciate what the eu stands for . 
  as far as jobs go , this is definitely true for romania . 
  * literally * everybody had jobs . 
  however , i do n't find it acceptable to trade job security for civil rights . 
  sure , one could work and get state-sponsored housing in one of the many ugly apartment buildings built on top of green areas and residential neighborhoods . 
  one could earn some money at the end of the month and then queue for hours in front of grocery stores to get some of the rationalized , poor quality food . 
  what was the point of working an abusive 6-day week , in poor safety conditions , for a rather small amount of money if you could do very few things with it ? 
  how is this better than capitalism ? 
  the older generations are already retired and love to complain about today 's society because they fail to understand it . 
  again , this may apply to some extent to other ee countries , but romania was different . 
  we followed the horrifying stalinist policies in the 50s and praised our soviet overlords just like everyone else , but since ceausescu rose to power in the 60s , things went to shit . 
  while the rest of ee was relaxing economic policies , following gorbachev 's guidelines , we were doing the opposite . 
  food was rationalized and the people were more oppressed than ever . 
  ceausescu was , in fact , following a north korean model since the late 70s and was an outspoken admirer of kim jong-il and his socialist police state . 
  if soviet communism was bad to the rest of the region , imagine what the nk model was doing to us . 
  old people were ignorant to all that . 
  as far as they were concerned , communism was awesome because they had jobs . 
  the younger generations were the ones who started the '89 revolution and overthrew the regime . 
  by 1991 it became quite obvious that our ` revolution ' was more of a coup and we were slowly descending back into dictatorship , similarily to how belarus turned out later . 
  it was n't the older generation that took a stand , but rather the young university students in bucharest , which were literally butchered during the protests . 
  i went on quite a bit here . 
  tl ; dr : romanian communism got jobs for everyone , but it sucked badly . 
  old people did nothing to help us get rid of it and they never supported the eu . 
  we and our parents were politically awesome . 
  \\* drops mike \\*, 
  is there a source for this ? 
  i 'm a youngster in ee and can confirm that i am 99 % pro eu , and i have yet to meet someone who is a part of my generation that hates it . 
  ironically , it 's actually the older generation that hates it and keeps preaching how communism was so much better and everybody had jobs and so on . 
  you 'd think they would have a different opinion given they lived in the stupidity of romanian communism .
