but they are a primarily kurdish force , not syrian arabic . 
  they mostly operate in the regions inhabited by the kurdish minority and do n't even particularly oppose the regime . 
  hence i do n't think they should really be considered `` rebels '' . 
  they seem to be a sideshow to the real civil war in syria . 
  get out of here with your logic . 
  [ all border walls are fascist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fascist_protective_rampart ) !, 
  yup . 
  some of the strongest non-isis rebel groups seem to be [ radical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_nusra ) [ islamists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_front_%28syria%29 ) as well . 
  it 's really hard to find any meaningful `` good guys '' in syria . 
  it is indeed wrong to make up right-wing conspiracy theories . 
  it 's more effective to simply point out the public policy of german and eu elites . 
  the explanation i remember from previous threads is that what 's really happening is not `` expropriation '' but merely a form of `` temporary forced renting '' . 
  yup , that 's germany for you . 
  the leading country in europe . 
  because there 's no good reason to think it would turn out differently from iraq . 
  how do you maintain order over millions of angry brutalized people ? 
  there is no obvious alternative government for the large sunni areas of iraq and syria . 
  any western ground invasion of isis territory will have to install a puppet government and deal with a very long violent insurgency . 
  this is highly misleading for romania . 
  the [ 2012 parliamentary election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_legislative_election,_2012 ) was won with 58 % by usl but they are not `` social democrat '' . 
  it has since split up . 
  a better way to measure this would be to count national mps by european party affiliation ( like epp versus pes ) . 
  in romania usl contained a mix of them . 
  poland technically has two center-right parties but one of them is actually part of [ aecr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_european_conservatives_and_reformists ) which is to the right of the epp . 
  the cost of safe travel is much lower than the cost of accommodation anyway . 
  if germany wants to take refugees with `` no limit '' let it do so without using the danger of the journey as a deterrent . 
  it should offer equal chances of resettlement to people who apply from the camps . 
   misconception : this is something that will be applied nation-wide to all people   not true . 
  this is a local , * short-term * solution to a very * short-term * problem . 
  this seems naive . 
  this is not a short term problem as all , germany seems committed to accepting very large number of people . 
  it seems very likely that in such a situation temporary measures will become permanent . 
   this is a problem that berlin wanted to tackle anyway i 'm sorry but what people do with their own private property is not an issue for politicians to discuss . 
  if people want to buy apartments as investments and leave them empty then it 's their fundamental right to do so . 
   misconception : the flats are stolen from people . 
    not true . 
  the owners receive compensation and how is that compensation calculated ? 
  as far as i know berlin also recently introduced rent control so it seems that the state will be able to decide the amount more or less arbitrarily . 
   the european commission expects a further 5 million refugees who will arrive in the next 3 years . 
  any better source than bild for this number ? 
   the period ( 3 years ) based on the assumption that at least as much time is necessary in order to * pacify the trouble spots in the middle east diplomatically and largely eliminate the escape causes . 
  * this is one of the dumbest things i 've ever read . 
   why is 1 million such a huge deal ? 
  it 's not . 
  we go from 120k to 1m and then the flow will stop and the problem will be solved . 
  me neither . 
  what 's the deal with posts debunking falsehoods that are not even widely publicized ? 
  the second part of the title is a statement which appears in the first paragraph . 
  hopefully this wo n't be considered editorialization , it serves to explain the extent of the crisis . 
   so [ central european countries ] will have to get used to that . 
  notice how he 's not offering any sort of choice to the people currently living in those countries . 
   fasicm is increasing rapidly not really . 
  there is far more to fascism than xenophobia , things like the promotion of an explicitly militarist culture and the total subjection of the citizen to the `` greater '' interest of the state . 
  the [ danish people 's party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_people%27s_party ) is classified as far-right and recently [ became the second largest party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_general_election,_2015 ) . 
  since the right-wing parties won the election overall the dpp could have asked for the prime minister post . 
  instead they opted to support a goverment from the * third * largest party , probably because they had more experience in government . 
  feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong in my interpretation of events , i 'm not danish . 
  would hitler or mussolini give up such an easy route to power ? 
   i think the conservative party in the uk is to the left of obama by most measures this is probably true . 
  i would love to see a properly detailed study which attempted to compare parties across national borders . 
  statements like `` the us is to the left of the eu '' and `` france is to the left of germany '' makes intuitive sense but it would be great if somebody could measure this properly . 
   the declared objective of agenda 2010 was to `` promote economic growth '' and , thus , `` reduce unemployment '' . 
  what i 'm seeing is spectacularly successful neoliberal economic policy which turned germany into the strongest economy in europe . 
  if anything it is the current cdu-dominated government that is coasting on the past achievements of the spd . 
  as far as i know the spd has largely repudiated agenda 2010 and thus have nothing but themselves to blame for electoral failure . 
   eastern europe got lots of problems on it 's own , if there are problems with minorities i actually disagree with this . 
  the biggest minority where i am from is formed by [ hungarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians_in_romania ) . 
  they have their [ own party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_union_of_hungarians_in_romania ) which is quite successful and highly relevant in our multi-party democracy . 
  our second largest minority is the rroma , a people which the west has [ failed to integrate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_romani_repatriation ) as well . 
  other minorities are not large or angry enough to cause any sort of meaningful problems . 
  being lectured by the west is quite infuriating . 
  we are dealing with our current citizens in a reasonable manner . 
  we do n't get [ major terrorist attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_norway_attacks ) , [ race riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_french_riots ) and our governments feels no particular need to [ assassinate it 's citizens ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/08/europe/uk-syria-drone-strike/ ) . 
  our problem is not actually with minorities , but with western idealists looking to `` increase diversity '' . 
  please kindly fuck off . 
   does anyone have an explanation as to why ? 
  this seems to be a european issue the short answer is that the us has very few muslims compared to europe . 
  some groups are harder to integrate than others , in a way that is proportional to cultural differences between the immigrants and host societies . 
  the gap between secular western and religious muslim cultures is probably the biggest that exists today in the world . 
   you know that those values only work in a society that is n't homogeneous , right ? 
  you can tolerate people without inviting them to move in . 
  good fences make good neighbors . 
  maybe what you 're seeing is your own opinion moving to the right . 
  this makes you more likely to notice leftist bias in the news you read because you disagree with it . 
  what logic ? 
  i am just pointing out a controversial but well-documented fact . 
  draw your own conclusions . 
  i am not stating that all refugees are terrorists . 
  it 's just that people fleeing conflict and brutality are * not * immune to the same kind of violent ideology which flourishes in conflict . 
  furthermore it is quite rational to treat large masses of them as a security risk . 
  some like to claim that a refugee who is fleeing isis would never turn to jihadism . 
  but it 's worth noting that the list of people who oppose isis also includes [ al-qaeda 's local affiliate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_nusra#open_fights_nusra.e2.80.93isil_.282013.e2.80.932015.29 ) . 
  it seems to me that you 're not actually disagreeing with me in any major way . 
   are we just making shit up now ? 
  what am i making up ? 
   terrorism is caused by ideology and religion is a major part in that . 
  do you disagree with my statement ? 
  please elaborate . 
   that is a risk europe has to take . 
  why ?
