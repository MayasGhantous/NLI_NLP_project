  because the eu says so ? 
  many of the countries in the east do n't want to take such a risk and their decision should be respected . 
   for several extended periods of their lives , the european system has near total control over them . 
  but that 's just not how our societies work . 
  we do n't brainwash people , we encourage them to be free and make up their own minds . 
  some sort of heavy-handed indoctrination could be used to stamp out islamism but europe society is just not willing to do that . 
  or maybe we should recognize that integrating muslim minorities is extremely difficult due to vast cultural differences and accepting more people will just make things harder . 
  and maybe the best way for people with vastly different values to coexist is by separating them in distinct countries with distinct laws that reflect local concerns . 
   it 's stupid and polarising while adding nothing of value . 
  so are mandatory quotas . 
  and this conversation . 
  i think that '' [ culture war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_war ) '' is an appropriate metaphor for the current conflict between the eastern and western eu . 
  the dynamic seems similar to that between the north and south in the us with one side considering the other to be culturally inferior . 
   you want terrorists ? 
  because this is how you get terrorists . 
  there 's an even easier way to get terrorists : just welcome large scale immigration from the muslim world . 
   alienate people enough , and they 'll get pissed off . 
  yes , hurt feelings are excuse for terrorism . 
   well i 'm glad to know terrorism is completely linked to where you 're from . 
  terrorism is caused by ideology and religion is a major part in that . 
   the profile of a typical european muslim terrorist is this : born and raised in europe  petty crime  jail  angry  terrorism . 
  i agree  it 's very very rare for recent arrivals to plan or commit terrorists acts . 
  so it 's mostly a long term ( multi-decade ) problem . 
  how reassuring . 
   as much as our media would like us to . 
  [ citation needed ] . 
  it seems to me that romania in general is far more interested in it 's own internal issues . 
  i would like to point out that `` today refugees , tomorrow terrorists '' is not just a slogan . 
  this has actually happened in the past . 
  [ dzhokhar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dzhokhar_tsarnaev ) and [ tamerlan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamerlan_tsarnaev ) tsarnaev came to the us as refugee children at ages 9 and 16 . 
  several years later they carried out the [ boston marathon bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_marathon_bombing ) . 
  they * literally * turned from refugees to terrorists . 
    nobody is pushing forced homogeneity . 
   except far righters explicitly saying they want their countries `` pure '' the demographic composition of a country is naturally mostly stagnant . 
  it is the eu that is * forcing change * through refugee resettlement . 
  the left is the aggressor here . 
   forced homogeneity is a policy pushed especially by the far right . 
  nobody is pushing forced homogeneity . 
  what is happening is the exact opposite of it . 
  all these people want is to keep syrians away . 
  since the syrians do n't even want to go to the baltics it seems like an easy win-win scenario . 
  but the left still call us all racists . 
   wo n't turning those in dire need away radicalize them ? 
  sure it will . 
  refusing welfare for non-citizens totally excuses terrorism . 
  after all , hungary does not belong to the hungarians , it belongs to the entire world . 
  no , but forcing resettlement is something that the ussr did extensively . 
   implying the protest against immigrants was organised because people fear far left instead of just being xenophobic . 
  forced diversity is a policy pushed especially by the far left . 
  the native people are right to push back . 
  forced population transfer was frequently used by the soviet union , including in the baltic states . 
  there are clear parallels between than and the mandatory quotas imposed by the eu . 
   [ smoked up leftist hippy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/stalin_in_exile_1915.jpg ), 
  yes , because terrorism is always the west 's fault . 
  we hurt their feelings and deserve to get bombed . 
   it 's quite extraordinary how one can be defending countries not wanting to take a couple thousand while giving asylum to tens of thousand in greece . 
  read my [ earlier answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ly3k0/disputed_eu_migrant_plan_voted_in_eu_ministers/cvargs8 ) . 
  i think we need to draw a distinction between [ temporary camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#camps ) and [ full resettlement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#resettlement ) . 
  make no mistake : the people risking their lives to reach germany have no intention of going back to syria . 
  they intend to settle in the west permanently . 
  that 's what you get if you accept migrants . 
  nigel warned you . 
   setting up camps requires money , supplies and only a relatively small amount of space . 
  the eu can provide the necessary resources . 
  since those people will be concentrated in just a couple locations the rest of the country does n't need to worry that much . 
  it would definitely be better than letting large groups of people roam around europe disregarding local laws . 
  i do n't think your questions really need to be answered in on a point-by-point basis . 
  setting up camps requires money , supplies and only a relatively small amount of space . 
  if lebanon can do it then so can any other eu country . 
  the un usually helps with this kind of stuff but in our case the eu can provide the necessary resources . 
  the reason we 're not doing this is that the eu does n't want to just provide basic shelter . 
  it wants to attempt to fully integrate these people into european societies . 
  this is a much bigger project which will ultimately occupy some countries for decades . 
  what the eu needs to do is recognize that it 's capability to absorb migrants is limited , establish some sort of ceiling and for the rest only provide accommodation comparable to that from un camps . 
  this is what can stop this mad rush to germany . 
   not carrying out their duties under dublin accords . 
  migrants are largely uncooperative . 
  when countries attempt to enforce the rules they 're labelled nazis . 
  this is the primary reason countries have opted to `` let them pass '' . 
   others ( romania ) are so fundamentally corrupt that any chance of border controls would have top rely on foreign troops . 
  fuck you too . 
   but is something that has to be done and quickly . 
  you can put up tents quickly . 
  not that hard . 
   yes let 's try out best to stop the flood of migrants . 
  now tell me how are you going to go about it . 
  establish [ camps on the borders ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/14/refugee-crisis-eu-governments-set-to-back-new-internment-camps?cmp=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld ) and detain anyone who attempts to leave . 
  also draw a clear distinction between providing `` safe refuge '' and `` resettlement '' . 
  resettlement ( what the eu is currently demanding from member states ) should only be provided to a subset of refugees on a purely voluntary basis . 
  many of these people are attempting to travel from turkey to germany . 
  if they 're assigned to romania or bulgaria they 'll actually end up worse off since these countries are poorer than turkey . 
   so yea we fucked up a lot with turks and the french fucked up with the algerians . 
  and the brittish with the pakistanis . 
  pretty much all the muslim minorities in the west are sending recruits to isis . 
  maybe we should learn from your mistakes and not accept large minorities from extremely different cultures . 
  especially since they want to come to romania anyway . 
  it 's win-win !, 
   without the eu you 'd be dealing with this crisis by yourself . 
  hungary seems to be quite capable of dealing with the crisis . 
  these people want to reach western europe so all they have to do is divert the flow .
