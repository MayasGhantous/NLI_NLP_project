  but still the city has much to offer . 
  houses are cheaper than in washington , an hour to the south . 
  unlike many suburbs , the city offers public transport and a diverse population . 
  such diversity is an economic boon as well as a comfort , providing niche markets for small businesses . 
  baltimore is now home to nepalese grocery shops and to a car service that takes darfuri refugees to work . 
  this is not to paint america as a paradise for asylum-seekers . 
  the country has accepted just 70,000 refugees annually in recent years . 
  to put that in perspective , 1.5 m refugees may reach germany this year . 
  nor is america 's welcome uniform . 
  if many europeans fret about sharing generous welfare systems , lots of americans fear infiltration by terrorists . 
  some conservative states , such as south carolina , have seen angry public meetings about syrian refugees in towns that have received none . 
  a trophy for scaremongering goes to donald trump , the businessman and republican presidential candidate . 
  if elected , he promises to expel all syrian refugees in case islamic extremists lurk in their midst , suggesting that asylum-seekers may be `` the greatest trojan horse of all time '' . 
  in fact , refugees are screened by several intelligence and security agencies for 18 months or more . 
  david miliband , a former british foreign secretary who heads the irc , jokes that securing refugee status is the most arduous route to america that does not involve swimming the atlantic . 
  baltimore and other post-industrial cities can not absorb every would-be refugee . 
  yet such hardscrabble places show that welcoming outsiders is not just a question of kindness . 
  done right , offering a haven can be an act of enlightened self-interest . 
   if you want the eu to do something , give it the power to do it . 
  giving the eu more powers would only make things worse . 
  migration is an issue that is too divisive to be handled at the union level . 
  the eu should back off and let individual countries make their own policies . 
  this article is all over the place . 
  i think the simple explanation is that putin has successfully created a new frozen conflict in eastern ukraine and sees no possible gain from further military escalation . 
  in the meantime ukraine is still a mess and not particularly improving . 
  god dammit germany !, 
  political violence is wrong , even against filthy leftist pigs . 
  yeah , let 's celebrate rioting . 
  perhaps we should also burn a few cars to mark the occasion ? 
  not to mention that the eu countries with opt-outs for the euro and migration policy are feeling quite good about their decisions . 
  it would be really nice to read an explanation more elaborate than calling akp voters poor and stupid . 
  these people are not interested in greece , they are going to germany because it 's welcoming them . 
  germany should fly them over , or otherwise accept responsibility for their deaths . 
  this is unbelievable . 
  here we have a journalist on state media loudly proclaiming that all must support the government and it 's unpopular policies because otherwise chaos would follow . 
  this is the kind of argument that you would expect to see in support of assad and mubarak , not angela merkel . 
  if you want merkel to stay in power then you must argue that her policies are right , not that we need to rally around the leader . 
  such arguments do not belong in a democracy . 
   i would n't disqualify turkey 's eu membership based purely on that . 
  even if they explicitly try to keep minorities out of parliament ? 
   the uk system is far worse . 
  not really . 
  under first-past-the-post rules the kurds would not have any trouble because they are geographically concentrated in the south-east . 
  they would be as successful as the snp . 
  what the fuck is up with a 10 % election threshold ? 
  as far as i know this is especially designed to keep the kurdish party out of parliament . 
  is this correct ? 
  i think this threshold by itself is enough to reject turkey 's eu membership bid . 
  1 ) you ca n't pay money instead . 
  as far as i know this was in one of the initial drafts but was dropped . 
  2 ) the numbers are already large and will probably grow 3 ) i do n't think these people will leave if syria stabilizes . 
  they would be stupid to do so . 
  it 's far more likely that they will eventually become eu citizens . 
   most of the muslims in belgium like things the wait they are . 
  this sounds very dubious and is difficult to reconcile with endless claims of discrimination and alienation . 
  germany needs * more * fighting , not less . 
   is the number of muslim people big enough in belgium so that political parties like this stand a chance to get any kind of power ? 
  according to wikipedia the number of muslims in belgium is about 6 % , roughly similar to the hungarian minority in romania . 
  it 's obviously possible for them to elect an [ udmr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmr ) - like party to parliament and it 's plausible that it might eventually become part of a ruling coalition . 
  it 's not clear that muslims in belgium support this party in a sufficiently disciplined way . 
  belgium is multi-party democracy with many small parties divided among ethnic lines . 
  they have `` french '' parties and `` flemish '' parties . 
  as islam is growing it makes sense to me that they will eventually have parties which appeal primarily to `` muslims '' . 
  this is what multi-culturalism looks like . 
  he 's not doing what the eu wants . 
  i 've seen multiple declarations urging national leaders to show `` vision '' on the migration issue and go against the wishes of their voters . 
  this seems to be a code word for `` compliance to brussels '' . 
  this is not right . 
  qualified majority voting was approved as part of the eu treaties and the people did not expect this to lead to large-scale mandatory resettlement . 
  many are justifiably angry that fine print is used to push through unexpected large changes . 
  what exactly are the criteria for being a safe country ? 
  i think simply being safe from active persecution should be sufficient . 
  being poor in turkey should not be an excuse for claiming asylum in the eu . 
  if turkey is defined as `` not safe '' then we should try to get on the same list and avoid taking in these people . 
  we have neither the means nor the will to take care of them . 
  tl ; dr : all hail our lord and saviour nigel farage !, 
  because communism was totalitarian evil imposed from the outside . 
  you might just as well ask the poles why they feel hostile towards nazism . 
  and was vichy france really all that bad ? 
  incoming : western progressives bashing backwards easterners . 
  just fuck off with your culture wars . 
  so denmark never had a minority government ? 
  it 's possible to name a prime minister without a majority in parliament and hope that he gets enough votes from third parties to pass anyway . 
  it 's frequently the case that multiple coalitions are possible , for example a left + center or right + center . 
  in semi-presidential systems ( like portugal ) this frequently ends up being decided by the president nominating the pm . 
  this is perfectly normal and constitutional . 
  the pm needs to be confirmed by parliament anyway . 
  if he fails to get a majority then i assume the process restart . 
  the comments on that tweet are horrible . 
   britain will lobby the european union and its member states to stop taxing tampons and other women 's sanitary products ** as luxury items ** , rather than necessities  currently , tampons and sanitary products are ** taxed at 5 percent ** in britain is this 5 % excessive ? 
  i see no reason to treat this differently than soap and toothpaste . 
  historically eastern europe has been a contested borderland between much larger and stronger countries with very strong opinions about how the world should be run . 
  today those neighbors are a resurgent imperialist russia and a do-gooding germany who apparently believes that it 's our responsibility to solve muslim civil wars through population transfer . 
  if i could i would teleport my country as far away from europe as possible . 
  apparently the [ antipode ] ( http://www.antipodr.com/ ) of romania would be somewhere in the south-west pacific ocean next to new zeeland . 
  that would be a much better neighborhood . 
   unless pis amends constitution to institute theocracy . 
  do n't like the weather ? 
  you get to move to europe !, 
  good luck with that .
