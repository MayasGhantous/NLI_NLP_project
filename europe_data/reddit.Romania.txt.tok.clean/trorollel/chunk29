  if the eurofederalists get their way eventually the only supreme court will be at the eu level . 
  date is `` 2 september 2015 '' . 
  your idea of `` working together '' seems to imply treating sovereign countries like the us treats wyoming . 
  fuck your union . 
  something like this is almost certainly going to happen . 
  the countries in the east are too poor to take care of their own citizens properly . 
  the only way we can house refugees in conditions acceptable to western activists would be to spend significantly more on per-capita basis than we spend on our native poor . 
  i 'm also eagerly awaiting eu demands for affirmative action , giving foreigners preferential treatment compared to natives . 
  it will be awesome . 
   this wo n't happen because germany imports 25 % of all czech exports bullshit . 
  you can have a free trade area without coercive political union . 
  the eu wants to turn all the nation states of eastern europe into mere provinces . 
  this is far more dangerous than mere corruption . 
  this is correct . 
  most of eastern europe does n't have a refugee problem . 
  our problem is with western attempts at social engineering . 
  we have an eu problem . 
  let 's hope italian trains do n't switch tracks . 
    huge advances in social and gender equality  that 's somehow questionable and partially just lies . 
  in romania the communist party [ severely limited both abortion and contraception ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decree_770 ) in order to increase the birth rate . 
  i see you are a member of the labour party . 
  how do you feel about jeremy corbyn and his recent [ decision ] to appoint ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11944144/jeremy-corbyn-appoints-top-advisor-who-once-defended-terrorism.html ) [ seumas milne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seumas_milne ) as a senior aide ? 
  among other controversial views this guy has [ publicly sided with putin against nato ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/nato-peace-threat-ukraine-military-conflict ) and has the following to say about communism :  for all its brutalities and failures , communism in the soviet union , eastern europe and elsewhere delivered rapid industrialisation , mass education , job security and huge advances in social and gender equality . 
  it encompassed genuine idealism and commitment ... its existence helped to drive up welfare standards in the west , boosted the anticolonial movement and provided a powerful counterweight to western global domination . 
  as somebody from eastern europe the current leadership of your party horrifies me . 
  among [ various other criticisms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seumas_milne#views ) this guy is an apologist for communism :  for all its brutalities and failures , communism in the soviet union , eastern europe and elsewhere delivered rapid industrialisation , mass education , job security and huge advances in social and gender equality . 
  it encompassed genuine idealism and commitment ... its existence helped to drive up welfare standards in the west , boosted the anticolonial movement and provided a powerful counterweight to western global domination . 
   i had little regard for the militant secularism and nationalism harbored by many within turkey 's old establishment . 
  the party enjoyed support from democrats , liberals and some social democrats who were eager to balance the excesses of the stern old secularist regime . 
  things are how they are for good reasons . 
  the secularism of the turkish military had served the country well for decades . 
  why challenge it ? 
  yes . 
  i ca n't think of any meaningful way to objectively measure corruption . 
  the best that can be done is to measure people 's subjective perceptions to some kind of uniform standard . 
   she stood by her remarks , saying she had used the word occupation `` with a small o '' and had not been referring to the second world war . 
  she denied islamophobia and said street prayers were a threat to public order , arguing they were `` not a race , ethnicity or religion , but a behaviour '' . 
  better data [ here ] ( https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) . 
  the most corrupt eu countries are bulgaria , romania , italy and greece at the same level . 
  yay ? 
    under modern laws this would be considered a major violation of human rights . 
   banning hate speech is a common thing . 
  i was referring to the banning of paganism . 
  everything about it was banned , not just advocating violence against christians . 
  the notion of `` hate speech '' is poorly defined and can be extended in ways that can be considered abusive . 
  it 's worth noting that cameron 's strategy * explicitly * includes [ targeting non-violent extremists ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/29/cameron-backing-theresa-may-counter-extremism-strategy-fundamental-shift ) because they provide a `` gateway '' to terrorism . 
    what you 're basically advocating for is pure totalitarianism . 
   no , no i am not . 
  if you have weird ass ideas and preach the killing of infidels off to an isolated prison with you where nobody can hear you scream and no young impressionable mind can have access to your hate speech . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're really serious . 
  it really is totalitarianism . 
  would you really apply the same standard to somebody who advocates for the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism ? 
  because there 's not much of a difference . 
  after all , communist revolutions have happened and have resulted in massacres of various forms of `` class enemies '' . 
   one would hope the opposition to it would involve more than just the muslims . 
  i think people are sadly resigned to it . 
  i found a very accurate explanation in [ / r/ukpolitics ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3phd5t/muslims_condemn_britains_plans_to_combat_extremism/cw6bqob ) :  this , the snoopers charter , and all the other assaults on our civil liberties are the result of a desperate scramble to try to counter the mistake we originally made - letting these people come here in the first place . 
   muslims should have put their own house in order years ago in the uk what does the even mean ? 
  you ca n't go blaming groups for actions of individuals . 
  the uk prides itself on being a relatively free country . 
  this means that people are free to make up their own minds even if that means rejecting it 's culture at large . 
  this applies to muslims as well . 
  if somebody is not happy with a `` moderate preacher '' he can seek the `` harder stuff '' and such behavior is mostly protected by the state . 
  i do n't think there 's any good way to combat extremism other than waiting for people to convince themselves to get along . 
   to be perfectly honest , i 'm not convinced this approach will work either . 
  i think it 's actually likely to breed further suspicion and resentment and make minority relations * worse * . 
   in reality banning ideas works out great . 
  why did old pagans disappear and christianity took their place ? 
  because pagan religions were banned . 
  under modern laws this would be considered a major violation of human rights . 
  what you 're basically advocating for is pure totalitarianism . 
  it does work but it requires a massive repressive apparatus and a great willingness to use violence . 
  this is ( happily ) lacking in most western countries . 
  heavy-handed but half-hearted attempts at enforcing orthodoxy will mostly just breed more resentment . 
  germany [ used to do it ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) in the 90s :  foreigners entering via safe third states in which they are not persecuted but can find protection do not have a right to asylum . 
  according to the `` first country concept '' , a refugee must seek protection in the state in which he/she first entered `` safe territory '' after fleeing from his/her home country . 
  hungary has similar laws [ right now ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/06/us-europe-migrants-hungary-iduskcn0pg10e20150706 ) . 
  they are denying asylum to anyone who crosses from countries considered safe . 
  all of hungary 's neighbors are considered safe . 
  this is not really comparable to having * actual laws * which severely punish apostasy and homosexuality . 
   i mean we can edit these agreements to fit present scenario right ? 
  yes . 
  it 's [ been done before ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) . 
  this is false . 
  countries can and should reject refugees which pass through other safe countries where they could claim asylum . 
  this legalistic argument is wrong and is invoked by people who want to accept as many immigrants as possible for unrelated ideological reasons . 
  laws of western countries are based to some extent on the bible . 
  as muslim minorities grow some laws might end up being inspired by the koran . 
  this is a normal part of democracy : the laws of the state will tend to match the values of the voters . 
  this ca n't be prevented by separation of church and state , all that says is that the state ca n't support one religion to the detriment of others . 
  i would like to point out a [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:apostasy_laws_in_2013.svg ) of countries where [ apostasy is illegal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apostasy#where_punished ) . 
  those are all islamic countries . 
  here is also a [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:world_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg ) of the legal status of homosexuality . 
  notice the overlap . 
   ` up with your hands ! ', 
  yelled a savage voice . 
   a handsome , tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol , while his small sister , about two years younger , made the same gesture with a fragment of wood . 
  both of them were dressed in the blue shorts , grey shirts , and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies . 
  winston raised his hands above his head , but with an uneasy feeling , so vicious was the boy 's demeanour , that it was not altogether a game . 
   ` you 're a traitor ! ',
