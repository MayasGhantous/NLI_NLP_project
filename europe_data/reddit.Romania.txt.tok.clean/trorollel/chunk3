  careful what you wish for . 
    do n't let people illegally enter your country . 
   this is not a `` solution '' unless you can actually explain how you will make this happen . 
  what happens today is that people leave refugee camps in turkey , cross multiple borders illegally and are then granted full resettlement in germany . 
  this is something that the people in refugee camps can also apply for but their chances of success are quite low . 
  what the eu should do is deport the illegal migrants back to the camps and only grant resettlement through legal channels . 
  then there would no longer be much of an incentive to risk your life crossing the mediterranean . 
  turkey was only used as an example here ; the eu could just as well organize camps on greek islands or in sicily . 
  plans along those lines have actually been proposed ; this is not just some hare-brained idea from an internet shithole . 
   asylum for the common asylum policy , european laws or framework laws will lay down measures for a common european asylum system , implying a qualified majority vote . 
  i do n't think many people expected that a clause about `` asylum policy '' would ever be used to force large scale mandatory resettlement quotas . 
  it can be argued that fine print is being abused . 
   we ca n't afford to require decisions by unanimity for matters that are urgent . 
  at this point the worse solution is no solution . 
  but this is not a solution . 
  assigning quotas treats a symptom ( masses of people ) in a way make the problem * worse * ( by encouraging more to come ) . 
  what we should be doing is find way to stop the flow of people , not accommodate it . 
   we need to put the interests of the indigenous people of the eu above all others . 
  then maybe you should change your flag . 
  til the world [ hotar ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hotar#romanian ) is shared with hungarian . 
  but it 's rarely used . 
   in the us we 're in a federal system  europe is actually a group of sovereign states exactly . 
  i think the west is failing to realize just how important national independence and self-determination is for some people . 
  most of the countries in the east have historically been unable to determine their own destinies and were instead dominated by stronger neighbors . 
  the eu seems to be bent on showing that this is still true . 
  so in your opinion it would be ok for the eu to legalize gay marriage across all it 's member states against the will of it 's members ? 
  i 'm sorry but i think all countries in the union should preserve their sovereignty . 
  we joined in order to cooperate in a mutually advantageous way , not to be dictated to . 
  [ he also hates his own country ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/3ly5na/european_interior_ministers_have_agreed_a_deal_to/cvahhrm ) :  romania comes out as the backwards , prejudiced country it really is . 
  he is scum . 
  the fact that we do n't want to live in the same country is the biggest thing that unites us with these migrants . 
  romania 's problem is not with refugees , it 's with the fucking eu . 
   refugees do n't automatically gain citizenship . 
  no , but the majority eventually will gain citizenship . 
  these people are not coming here temporarily , they are settling down . 
   also , welfare in bulgaria is temporary . 
  i suspect the welfare regime is different for refugees . 
  it will be fun when the eu starts forcing us to give better benefits for refugees than we give to our own poor citizens . 
  i know our current quota is `` a few thousand '' but it will eventually reach `` a few tens of thousands '' . 
  my claim that the total number will go significantly over 120000 is based on public declarations of eu politicians . 
  it 's not a conspiracy , it 's policy . 
   basically any international agreement is a trade-off of sovereignties to a certain degree . 
  yes . 
  and over the last month the eu trade-off became a very very bad one . 
   it goes without saying that a nation state can not claim full sovereignty and decide on everything by itself while they 're a member in an union . 
  we should stop being a member then . 
  the uk has the right idea , fuck this union !, 
  mass resettlement was not part of the original deal . 
  if it was we would have probably never joined . 
  no , fuck the eu . 
  romanian democracy is working just fine . 
  this is an external entity imposing it 's will upon us . 
  we should refuse to comply . 
  they deserve to lose very very badly over this . 
   a few thousand refugees it 's not just `` a few thousand '' . 
  the 120000 currently up for relocation is just a drop in the bucket . 
  once quotas are established they will be increased again and again . 
  here is [ a direct quote ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34329825 ) :  the number of those needing to relocation will probably have to be ** revised upwards significantly ** this is very large scale demographic experiment carried out by the west . 
  it must be stopped at all cost . 
  this is for romania to decide . 
  the exact interpretation of who exactly is allowed to request asylum differs between countries and has been changed in the past . 
  notably the german [ 1993 compromise ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) :  ** foreigners entering via safe third states ** in which they are not persecuted but can find protection ** do not have a right to asylum ** . 
   your country signed dublin ii before , another treaty , which had , until recently , required refugee quotas . 
  source ? 
  as far as i know refugee quotas are a new proposal . 
   notably , there is absolutely nothing in there that says you 're no longer a refugee if you do n't stay in the first safe country , as is often claimed . 
  that 's just made up . 
  all laws are made up and can be remade . 
  the current definition is obviously vulnerable to abuse by asylum shopping . 
  it must be changed . 
   refugees spurn france in search for better life if france is not good enough for you then you should lose your refugee status . 
   because his opinion does n't agree with yours ? 
  because he 's arguing in bad faith . 
  not all form of `` help '' are equal . 
  the quota request is absolutely unacceptable . 
   the sheer amount of indecision is really a bad thing here and an axe at the foundations of the eu . 
  what indecision ? 
  countries are pretty set in their position . 
  this is a major internal conflict . 
  germany imposed border controls . 
  this qualifies as `` spiraling out of control '' . 
  if you want to help everybody which wants to go to germany you should help them equally . 
  using the danger of traveling across europe illegally as a way to reduce intake is absolutely perverse . 
  you are forcing people to risk their lives in order to prove themselves worthy of living in your country . 
  this is no better than having them fight to the death for your amusement , and considerably less honest . 
  i have a feeling that we 'll see more and more eu flags burning . 
   it 's just odd to find people protesting the oceanification of their land in the middle of the sahara do n't you think ? 
  no it 's not . 
  people can be concerned about things outside their direct immediate experience . 
   he 's only just been elected leader . 
  and has n't fucked any pigs yet . 
  is this haram ? 
  this sounds haram . 
   so what you 're saying that smugglers can run the border between croatia and bih without ever getting caught ? 
  there is a difference between catching smugglers and stopping large numbers of migrants from crossing . 
  the latter would require using too much violence, 
   we also learned that refugees will protest and demonstrate until they are let through . 
  nope . 
  after hungary closed it 's border with serbia it stayed closed , despite violent protests . 
  what we learned is that walls work .
