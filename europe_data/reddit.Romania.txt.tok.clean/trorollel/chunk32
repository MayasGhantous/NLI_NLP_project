  you seem to be pretending that the eu is already a single super-stage when it is clear not . 
  the member countries still maintain their sovereignty . 
  even if the eu suddenly became a super-state overnight ( as some people clearly desire ) what would follow is not `` decisive action '' but a massive outbreak of separatism . 
  the problem is that fundamentally voters in ( e.g ) hungary are not willing to recognize the votes of germans as legitimate on all issues . 
  especially not on asylum and immigration policy . 
  if you ignore this then the union will break it 's citizens will be happy to see it . 
  the only way the eu can survive is by allowing it 's members to set different policies on sensitive issues . 
  this seems to be behind a paywall . 
  can somebody post the full content ? 
  greece could have defaulted on their debt and gone back to the drachma . 
  that might have actually been better for greece . 
  it would have been painful in the short term but eventually they would have recovered . 
  i think the reason this did n't happen is because of syriza 's political desire to continue as part of the eu and euro . 
  they were fools in attempting to `` renegotiate '' the bailouts , it was obvious that they had no leverage and failure was inevitable . 
  germany ( and a few others ) is allowing refugees to apply for asylum despite traveling through multiple safe countries . 
  this is what makes people to travel illegally halfway across the continent . 
  the countries that are encouraging this asylum shopping behavior are the ones that should deal with the consequences . 
  please note that this is article is about violence * between the refugees * . 
  this seems like a big deal . 
  the plan seems to be that turkey will keep migrants in eu-funded camps in exchange for : * money . 
  * visa relaxation for turks . 
  * eu takes 500k and redistributes them . 
  once ? 
  * possible diplomatic support for a syrian buffer zone ? 
  i do n't see how russia would agree . 
  at least the eu is recognizing that it needs to limit the flow rather than accommodate it . 
   a plan forced through last month to share 120,000 refugees across the eu triggered a huge row between governments . 
  if berlin and brussels agreed to take an additional 500,000 from turkey , germany would insist they be spread across the eu , * inviting a backlash * . 
  no kidding . 
  a jump of more than 4x . 
  remember how the first redistribution applied to 40k migrants , and then 120k were added on top ? 
  i wonder what 's next after 500k . 
  tougher how ? 
  force them out of the eu ? 
  bomb the acropolis ? 
   as a young healthy man i find it very concerning that people think that i would n't have the right to flee from a war zone . 
  once upon a time you would have been lynched for a comment like that , but now you get upvotes . 
   he 's pro-putin [ citation needed ], 
   jean-claude mailly , leader of force ouvri\u00e8re ( workers ' strength ) , declared that `` you can fight a management without being violent . 
  this is not part of our traditions . '' but does he really know the traditions of french syndicalism in the first place ? 
   the airline workers have embraced the roots of french trade unionism : anarcho-syndicalism ( syndicalisme means trade union in french ) . 
  in the late 19th century , it was a workers ' movement that advocated ** direct action ** by the working class . 
  this entire article is basically an endorsement of left-wing thuggery . 
   it 's really time to take a reasonable approach on the topic , * without any ideological bs . 
  * but people who opposes unbounded mass immigration from the muslim world are `` extremists '' and `` mindless zombies '' ? 
  because nothing says `` mindless zombie '' quite like changing you political affiliation when facts change . 
  it seems to me that you are the one who is filled with ideological bs . 
  yeah , peace is so boring . 
  let 's have a little ethnic conflict to spice things up !, 
   the eu is just another way . 
  exactly . 
  giving politicians another way to do unaccountable shit is * bad * . 
   maybe the problem is shitty politicians ? 
  politicians are universally shitty . 
  this is why we limit their power and try to kick out some of the worse ones on every elections . 
  what we should n't do is give them ways to pass legislation in less accountable ways . 
   europe needs to stop complaining about the fine print and get it signed or we will fall behind . 
  this is the dumbest argument ever . 
  i hope you 're trolling . 
  ideally the ep should be used for eu-wide issues . 
  what this article shows is that it 's being used by national governments to pass legislation which would otherwise fail or which they do n't want to claim responsibility for . 
  it 's being explicitly used this way because it is less accountable and it allows national elites to shrug and say `` the eu made me do it '' . 
  are you seriously ok with giving your government ways to work around the national legislature ? 
  assad is dropping more bombs on his citizens . 
  you see no problem with intentionally working around national parliaments ? 
  do n't be paranoid . 
  the excesses of student politics are entirely harmless and it 's not like academics ever get to influence policy . 
  so [ did kim jong-un ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_korean_parliamentary_election,_2014 ) . 
   now there may be some rebels who are semi-secular enough to not be considered terrorists but they are likely a minority even among so called moderate rebels , imho . 
  i agree , sadly . 
   other countries sometimes asked british meps to push legislation through the ** european parliament ** . 
  i fail to see how strengthening the ep is a good thing . 
  what we should do is weaken the eu overall . 
  you are overestimating germany 's importance to the wider world . 
  i do n't think the kurds should be included in `` opposition to assad '' . 
  it 's very likely that if other rebels were defeated they would cooperate with the regime . 
    if nato had to pick between sweden and turkey . 
  they would pick us . 
   not really . 
  nato is about values , not size of army . 
  turkey has the second largest army in nato . 
  also , fuck your values !, 
   50 or 60 years ago , when the job was highly respected , males dominated . 
  was early education ever `` highly respected '' ? 
  as far as i know you can teach stuff like kindergarten and primary school without a college degree . 
  in romania this changed recently and now primary teachers have to go back and get degrees . 
   karen bradley told a fringe meeting at conservative party conference that other countries sometimes asked british meps to push legislation through the european parliament so it could not be blocked by their own national legislatures . 
  european democracy in action !, 
  the insanity spawned by nazi guilt is absolutely amazing . 
  silly right-wingers . 
  freedom of speech does n't mean freedom from consequences . 
  you will always be free to express your views online . 
  it 's just that if those views are `` incorrect '' we will do our best to ruin your life and then feel smug about it . 
  welcome to the future . 
  yup . 
  it 's a pretty well known fact that among the rebels other than isis the strongest groups are islamists as well . 
  if a sharia-ruled syrian state is a better outcome than an sharia-ruled caliphate with global ambitions is up to you . 
  putin designates all opposition to assad as terrorists . 
  it 's a simpler worldview . 
  luckily for the eu most people do n't actually know what caused the popups .
