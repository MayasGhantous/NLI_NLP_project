   usually the chancellor has a majority behind him in parliament the european commission in theory need a majority in the european parliament but in practice it has always relied on a grand coalition of the major center-right and center-left parties . 
  here is the vote for [ approving the junker commission ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-election-of-the-commission-appointment-of-the-juncker-commission-approbation.html#/##vote-tabs-list-2 ) . 
  notice how it passed with 60 % support from epp , s&d and alde . 
  i think that such grand coalitions are largely unhealthy . 
  democracy should be competitive . 
   directly from national democracies yes , `` directly from somebody else '' . 
  this is generally called `` indirectly '' . 
  the european comission technically needs to be approved with a majority of the eu parliament just like the governments of many countries . 
  in practice the eu parliament has always operated as a grand coalition . 
  all important decisions are made through negotiation and the results of european elections are largely irrelevant . 
   you just need 4 countries representing at least 35 % of total eu population to block any decision at eu level . 
  according to this [ voting calculator ] the uk + all of eastern europe is still not enough to block a decision in the full council . 
  i included : * poland * romania * bulgaria * hungary * czech republic * slovakia * lithuania * latvia * estonia * croatia * slovenia * uk together these 12 countries make up only 33.02 of population . 
  if you add finland then the proposal fails but not due to population but because 16 members need to be in favor . 
  does not seem vast at all . 
  i agree with his argument . 
  please explain why you think he 's wrong . 
   you 're using the term `` should '' a lot , but you 're giving very little justification as to why any of us should want the same thing you want . 
  you 're willing to trade of national sovereignty so that the eu can be a powerful independent actor on the world stage . 
  i do n't believe this is a trade worth making because i do n't really  small countries only have de jure independence , not a de facto one . 
  small countries are indeed very limited in what they can do internationally . 
  but they can make defensive alliances while preserving a lot of independence for internal affairs . 
  the eu is not like that . 
  it wants to be far more than a cooperative club , it wants to mold it 's members into a particular vision and is willing to do so against their will . 
  it 's likely that we will see even more of that in the future . 
  for example people in brussels might very well decide that abortion * must * be legal all across the eu . 
  countries like poland would be forced to accept this no matter what their own citizens vote for . 
  this would be justified by saying that across the eu people are in favor of this so the decision is democratic . 
  even weak countries like the baltics have vastly more control over their own laws than american states . 
  this independence is worth preserving against the ambitions of brussels . 
   at the heart of the eu is the assertion that the continent of europe is -- or should become -- a demos , a single political entity . 
  that is incorrect . 
  the european continent self-evidently has a long history of cultural , social , linguistic , and political diversity . 
  the effort to force it into an artificial unity is being made , and must be made , through undemocratic meas . 
   china builds road right around `` nail house '' as owner luo baogen refuses to sell what that seems to show is that communist china has stronger private property protections than germany . 
  it 's a very reasonable assumption that most of them wo n't leave . 
  people do n't risk their life crossing borders from turkey all the way to germany just for temporary safety . 
  they go to germany because they want to live in germany , permanently . 
   they can obtain german citizenship just like anybody else with a decent job . 
  and that 's exactly what most of them will attempt to do . 
  if all they wanted was safety they could have found that in many countries along the way . 
  they 're claiming asylum in germany because they want to become permanent residents and eventually citizens . 
  it 's possible - and also wrong . 
  i know that it is technically legal based on eminent domain . 
  but such laws should only be invoked for projects like highways . 
  what is happening in germany seems to be straight forward nationalization . 
  the government is taking away private property because it wants it to be used in a different way . 
  it seems to me that germany has successfully removed nazism but under the mask of a supposedly liberal society there are still deep totalitarian tendencies . 
  they are effectively nationalizing private property in order to redistribute it . 
  this policy is not compatible with any sane definition of freedom . 
  edit : i know that this is technically legal based on eminent domain . 
  such laws should only be used infrastructure projects , not nationalization . 
  what 's happening in germany is that the government is taking away private property so that it can use it in `` better ways '' . 
  german politicians do n't debate in english , they debate in their own language . 
  their arguments are literally incomprehensible to the wider eu population . 
  we have to turn to translations from the english press instead . 
  it 's also worth noting that for the 2014 european parliament elections major parties put forward `` spitzenkandidats '' . 
  they even attempted to [ organize tv debates ] ( https://euobserver.com/news/124235 ) , but did so in * german * . 
  only ~ 13 % according to the [ 2001 ukrainian census ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budjak#ethnic_groups_and_demographics ) . 
  that are should really be pink, 
  language borders are very wrong in several areas . 
  you should have picked an existing linguistic map . 
  i assume that `` particularly serious crime '' does not include rioting but is rather intended to prevent known terrorists and war criminals from claiming sanctuary . 
  you can claim that people who reach germany should have applied for asylum along the way and are therefore not entitled to refugee status . 
  but if you do actually grant them this status then you also ca n't deport them . 
   wo n't she be better among her own people ? 
  you 're right , we should fix this . 
  she should bring [ her people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudeten_germans ) with her so that she wo n't feel alone . 
  the czechs will enjoy the diversity and it 's unlikely [ that germans will radicalize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudeten_german_party ) . 
   the european scientific community has been pan-european since natural philosophy was practiced in monasteries . 
  if by `` european '' you mean `` global '' then yes , otherwise it is nonsense . 
   nation states are an artificial creation conceived by elites eager to enhance their influence . 
  does that also apply to the proposals for a scottish state ? 
  catalonia ? 
  what about kurdistan ? 
  nation states exist in order to recognize the fact that large groups of people who consider themselves `` different '' should have a right to govern themselves . 
  on the contrary , i would say that the eu itself is `` an artificial creation conceived by elites eager to enhance their influence '' . 
  it started with the recognition that former great powers like france and germany could n't really compete with the us and ussr and could continue to be relevant by joining forces . 
   influence , power , potential , agency , global clout and sovereignty that is genuine as opposed to imaginary sovereignty of small states . 
  most of that does n't actually sound desirable at all . 
  all small countries really need to do is maintain their independence and take reasonable care of their citizens . 
  we should not seek `` power and influence '' . 
  what europe needs is defensive alliances ( nato ) and free cooperation between sovereign states ( like the earlier eu ) . 
  we do n't need any sort of coercive federalism implied in `` ever closer union '' . 
  what we need is a * looser * union . 
  in particular it should never be possible for eu institutions to impose their will upon member states , democratically or not . 
  i pretty much hold opposite opinions on every point of this article . 
  you [ ca n't deport asylum seekers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) . 
  if they commit crimes you need to punish them locally . 
   `` the university exchange programme erasmus is barely mentioned in the business sections of newspapers , yet erasmus has created the first generation of young europeans . 
  i call it a sexual revolution : a young catalan man meets a flemish girl -- they fall in love , they get married and they become european , as do their children . 
  the erasmus idea should be compulsory -- not just for students , but also for taxi drivers , plumbers and other workers . '', 
  this is not only unbelievably manipulative and heavy-handed but also largely pointless . 
  in europe `` national identity '' is defined primarily through the native language . 
  since there is no single `` eurolang '' the notion of an unifying `` european identity '' is simply not plausible . 
  whatever culture europeans share is also shared with countries like canada and australia . 
  europe is a collection of independent nation states and that 's all it should ever be . 
  when i saw this i assumed it was just a repost . 
  some people like to post this kind of crap just to recycle the anger . 
  but the date is 2015.10.01 , today .
