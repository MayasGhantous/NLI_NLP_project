  hungary will build a wall on it 's border with croatia and close that border too . 
   so all we accomplished the last week is to delay the flood into austria and eventually germany . 
  they will probably go through slovenia directly into austria . 
   that 's not a viable options because people will not be able to rebuild a life due to that . 
  but the vast majority of refugees must return to syria after the war . 
  we ca n't just transfer all of syria 's population to other countries . 
  i think there is a confusion between offering safe refuge and [ resettlement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee_resettlement#resettlement ) . 
  if countries want to offer resettlement for some refugees then that 's fine , but the eu seems to be pushing in the direction of * mandating * that eu countries provide full resettlement for * everyone * . 
  this is not acceptable . 
  what we should do is build camps on the eu borders ( either inside the eu or out ) and keep refugees there until it 's safe for them to return . 
  if countries want to offer resettlement they should do so on a purely voluntary basis . 
  and if somebody leave the camps and attempts to force his way to germany he must be * deported * back to the same camp . 
  the title is confusing but it seems to be the title from yle.fi , the finnish state broadcaster . 
  the fact that this is a new single-day record is largely irrelevant . 
  i bet many countries broke new records in the last few weeks . 
  i was going to say [ citation needed ] but then i [ found this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3lelw8/thanks_mod_team_youre_the_best/cv5w1to ) . 
  my editorialisation was restricted to punctuation . 
  is this not allowed ? 
  here is the original title of the article :  merkel wants ` binding ' eu refugee quotas with no ceiling if you search the web for this exact title you will find lots of identical articles . 
  as far as i know this means that article and title comes unmodified from afp . 
  i 'm not sure that the title is accurate , but it comes from afp . 
  maybe they just connected some separate out-of-context quotes ? 
   but we need a common asylum system . 
  that 's the only option if the eu should survive the next few years . 
  i 'd rather leave the eu than accept mandatory quotas . 
   so you only want the part of the democracy that suits you best ? 
  i want democracy at a national level . 
  that works much better . 
  if my country is overruled on the asylum issue because of democracy at the eu level i would rather leave the union than comply . 
  i think it should just let them settle in bosnia . 
  it will be easy to make them [ feel like at home ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3167057/isis-stronghold-discovered-picturesque-european-village-ready-respond-summons-jihad.html ) . 
  where is the hungarian wall ? 
  til bosnia uses the . ba domain . 
  i think this kind of incident makes a good argument in favor of reinstating the death penalty in the eu . 
  this is worse than i expected . 
  [ let the hate flow through you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oy6dwhai70 ), 
  lol, 
  so how are mandatory quotas supposed to work again ? 
  what if these people are sent to poland and start protesting for passage into germany ? 
   you have probably spoken that opinion in front of lots of people and none of them have labeled you a nazi . 
  you have . 
   muslim women are capable of standing up for * ourselves *  by [ susan carland ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2521155.htm )  susan teaches gender studies , politics , and sociology at monash university , with a special focus on muslim women and muslims in australia . 
   she converted to islam at the age of 19 . 
  fucking white people . 
   all 3 became very angry and said that oktoberfest is offensive and intolerant towards muslims i do n't believe this . 
  what about tunnels ? 
  today the border between serbia and hungary looked quite a bit like syria . 
  the mistake is understandable . 
  this video is in polish , is there any translated transcript anywhere ? 
  otherwise the post is pointless because most people ca n't understand anything . 
  you can already take people through the [ unhcr resettlement program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#resettlement ) . 
  many countries do so , in a controlled manner . 
  the problem is that you are basically offering full resettlement to everybody who sets foot in germany . 
  this is what causes this huge flood of people crossing borders illegally . 
  you should recognize that you ca n't offer resettlement to everybody and that most refugees will have to wait in camps for the end of the war . 
  a limited program which gives equal treatment to refugees currently in turkey/lebanon would be much fairer and more orderly . 
  this is what the uk is doing . 
   turkey is not on the list of safe third countries , mostly because you ca n't ensure people get a fair asylum process . 
  they 're full . 
  that 's not a reasonable definition of `` safe '' . 
  what `` safe '' should mean in this context is `` not at war '' . 
  no it 's not . 
  the dublin agreement only applies to the eu . 
  turkey is a safe country which already hosts millions of refugees . 
  if the 1993 compromise were still applied correctly anyone who set foot in turkey would lose the right to asylum in europe . 
  there would no longer be any incentive to cross the aegean to greece since everybody who did would be deported back to the camps . 
  all of those comments are harmless . 
  the most they can do is make the anti-immigration camp look bad . 
  large scale censorship against `` xenofobia '' and `` racism '' is too vague and can too easily be abused to silence legitimate concerns . 
  it is far better to err on the side of freedom and allow angry people to spew their bile . 
  in case you were wondering what `` tightens asylum laws '' means : http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html  ** foreigners entering via safe third states ** in which they are not persecuted but can find protection ** do not have a right to asylum ** . 
  according to the `` first country concept '' , a refugee must seek protection in the state in which he/she first entered `` safe territory '' after fleeing from his/her home country . 
  we should adopt something similar at the eu level . 
   * limited * mandatory distribution is n't the amount assigned to poland larger than the 10k obama has `` generously '' offered to take ? 
   the question before europe 's national leaders is not whether they should welcome immigrants but how to cope the arrogance is breathtaking . 
   `` when is it ok to beat your wife ? '', 
  when she opposes immigration . 
  i do n't think this applies to denmark . 
  you already have an opt-out and are probably a net contributor to eu funds . 
  this declaration is aimed at eastern countries . 
   correct me if i 'm wrong , but without welfare these people would be pretty fucked . 
  not really . 
  they could run from poland to germany and get help from the local syrian community . 
   they could also make sure these people can not work in other countries too could they not ? 
  there are plenty of countries where illegal employment ( without a contract ) is quite common . 
  probably not germany though . 
  under the [ 1993 compromise ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) the german basic law was amended to this effect :  foreigners ** entering via safe third states ** in which they are not persecuted but can find protection ** do not have a right to asylum ** . 
  according to the `` first country concept '' , a refugee must seek protection in the state in which he/she first entered `` safe territory '' after fleeing from his/her home country . 
  once people leave refugee camps they in order to go to a `` better country '' they should no longer be considered refugees but illegal migrants instead . 
   we do n't need to debate on who is and is n't a refugee yes we do . 
  too many people on the pro-immigration side are abusing the definition to prevent any sort of sane policy . 
   ask countries to provide six months of accommodation  have a drop-dead clause that says that if no agreement can be reached by that time , the eu will agree to deport to the most-likely source country and member countries agree to not penalize other member countries for doing so . 
  that 's not plausible . 
  once migrants are accepted they are going to stay there and nobody is willing to kick the out . 
  any temporary accommodation should be provided as centralized refugee camps . 
  that requires no distribution among countries . 
  i think eastern europe should be willing to accept this . 
  no amount of money is worth [ race riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_french_riots ) . 
   it gave no detail on how the asylum-seekers would be shared out . 
  so what the fuck did they agree on ?
