  the principle of `` safe state '' would not apply only to the eu but worldwide . 
  refugees who leave camps in turkey in order to reach germany would be deported right away , by greece . 
  this would remove any incentive for `` asylum shopping '' and largely stop the migration crisis ( including the drownings ) . 
  if germany and other northern countries want to offer resettlement they should do so by picking a fixed number of people from the camps . 
  they can help as many people as they feel like without forcing them to risk their lives crossing the mediterranean . 
  hooray , it 's `` let 's pretend to follow the law '' time again . 
  i think we should demand a return of the [ 1993 german asylum compromise ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) . 
  key point :  foreigners entering via safe third states in which they are not persecuted but can find protection do not have a right to asylum . 
  according to the ** `` first country concept '' ** , a refugee must seek protection in the state in which he/she first entered `` safe territory '' after fleeing from his/her home country . 
  applying this principle syrian refugees would be forced to seek protection in the first safe state that they cross into , most likely turkey or lebanon . 
  the principle of `` safe state '' would not apply only to the eu but most neighboring countries as well . 
  refugees who leave camps in turkey in order to reach germany would be deported straight back . 
  this would remove any incentive for `` asylum shopping '' and largely stop the migration crisis ( including the drownings ) . 
  if germany and other northern countries want to offer resettlement they should do so by picking a fixed number of people from the camps . 
  they can help as many people as they feel like without forcing them to risk their lives crossing the mediterranean . 
  obviously forcing any sort of `` mandatory quotas '' on other eu countries is absolutely unacceptable . 
   what about the opinions of the citizens ? 
  what if they do n't want to be forced into a multicultural society ? 
  it seems that the western leftist hive mind has turned quite sharply against nationalism in any form . 
  we 're up for a rough ride . 
   so the purport from the country that is among the ones taking the least refugees while accepting the largest sums of money is : no refugees , because they 're too expensive ? 
  no , eastern european countries do n't want to take these refugees because they do n't think they 're capable of properly integrating them into their local societies . 
  this is something that many western countries have failed at as well . 
  now they have to run `` counter-extremism '' programs and spy on their own citizens . 
  no amount of money is worth having to deal with such problems . 
  between losing eu funds and accepting refugees i 'd go with the former . 
  when mandatory quotas were first proposed it was for 20000 people , now we 're up to 160000 . 
  i do n't think we should accept this unless we 're willing to distribute millions of people . 
  because that 's how many would come to europe . 
  you can find the numeric quotas in [ this document ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/communication_on_the_european_agenda_on_migration_annex_en.pdf ), 
   this is just propaganda . 
  just like mein kampf . 
  because nobody would actually say such horrible things and then take action . 
  the eu is pushing for an unpopular refugee redistribution scheme . 
  the uk has an opt-out but it 's not surprising that watching this insanity unfold makes them want to quit . 
  it proves that the union is getting worse , not better . 
  it even makes me want to quit , and romania has overwhelmingly benefited from the eu . 
  according [ this document ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/communication_on_the_european_agenda_on_migration_annex_en.pdf ) describing asylum quotas the uk would have to receive 11.54 % . 
  this is only if it accepts to participate , which is very unlikely . 
  according to the poll posted above only 8 % would be willing to accept more than 10k people in the uk , which would be the uk 's quota when applied to a total of ~ 100k people . 
  it 's very likely that the eu/germany would try to apply the quotas for a much larger number of people . 
   or turkey ? 
  not an eu member , but a strategic partner . 
  let them take in millions of refugees ? 
  they are already taking in millions . 
  you can provide further funding for the camps . 
  if you want to offer resettlement you should offer equal chances to refugees currently living in turkey . 
  stop encouraging people to risk their lives . 
  [ this is what david cameron is doing ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/cameron-bows-to-pressure-to-allow-more-syrian-refugees-into-britain ) :  people selected to come to the uk are likely to be drawn from the unhcr camps on the border of syria and not from calais or other locations near the country . 
   contrary to what you believe those rights do n't entail ` you stop being a refugee once you leave the country you 're fleeing . ', 
  being a refugee should not grant the right to shop around for the best country to resettle . 
  but western policy allows this and in fact actively encourages it . 
  people do n't risk their lives crossing the sea from turkey to greece because turkey is unsafe . 
  turkey is safe . 
  they are crossing because countries in the west are actively rewarding this behavior with benefits far more generous that those available in turkey . 
  if you were serious about helping people you would ensure that people currently in camps near the syrian border get the same help as the people who prove themselves worthy by reaching your territory . 
  it is western policy which makes people risk their lives and drown their children . 
   true : romanians moving here are just economic migrants , while syrians are actually fleeing an active warzone . 
  if all they wanted was to flee an active warzone then they would not leave turkey and go through multiple peaceful states in order to reach germany . 
  it 's also worth noting that romanians are crossing borders legally . 
   wanting to help out in no way whatsoever . 
  your immigration policy is insane and it is our duty to point that out . 
  you should be grateful for eastern european opposition . 
   thanks for that . 
  you are welcome . 
  not all immigrants are the same . 
  muslim minorities are problematic because they have a problem with extremism . 
  this seems to be an issues in all western countries . 
  we should learn from your mistakes and avoid them . 
  i do n't think it will last for 10 years . 
  what is currently drawing the migrants is the insane policy of certain northern countries , and it ca n't possibly last . 
  eurosceptic parties will see a massive boost ( beyond the current 15-20 % ) and force a change of policy . 
  we will also start seeing euroscepticism in the east , where it has been so far abset . 
  it 's also possible that several eu members will leave over the next 10 years . 
  `` romania is a poor country '' is a quote from a migrant . 
  the second post is about a private donation by volunteers . 
  i 'm curious , has this crisis impacted the polish election ? 
  have the parties taken distinct positions ? 
  the hungarian goverment 's reaction has been indeed quite erratic . 
  but they are dealing with tens of thousands of people who are unwilling to follow the law . 
  some confusion is to be expected . 
  [ non-sequitur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non_sequitur_%28logic%29 ) the fact that many eastern europeans went to the western europe does not in way imply that the remaining eastern europeans must provide resettlement to muslims . 
  i wonder how the russians feel about this . 
   her bluff could get called it absolutely should get called . 
  eastern europeans should n't have to live with muslim ghettos so that germans can feel good about helping . 
  fuck the germans . 
  this actually makes a lot of sense . 
  life for them would be much better in turkey than romania , let alone germany . 
  i ca n't imagine how `` redistribution quotas '' could possibly work . 
  how are we supposed to keep them here ? 
  no worries , the open-borders propaganda machine will fix them . 
  fine by me . 
  i think it 's time for everybody to recognize that `` open borders '' is an absolute disaster . 
  his numbers are not really that wrong . 
  syrians who are currently living in turkey and lebanon should have the same asylum rights as the ones who leave the camps and risk their lives to go to europe . 
  the fact that only a fraction or the willing reach europe is due to the fact that the route is dangerous . 
  relying on this to reduce the number of asylum seekers that reach germany is perverse and cruel . 
  if the eu wants to offer resettlement to syrian refugees it should be honest about the scale of the problem . 
  we are dealing with millions of people here . 
  turkey is not a warzone .
