but in all fairness , [ rural ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=romanian+villages&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1643&amp;bih=932&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=y9dcvlpeeegsygov9odoca&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) romania is not categorised by such poverty . 
  actually he has somewhat of a point . 
  it is part of their culture . 
  worst criminal case i ever heard from the nl . 
  they should do that ... 
  do you think there are arrestees in the netherlands ? 
  lol, 
  in romania we also have [ these ] ( http://www.nineoclock.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/imagine51.jpg ) , [ these ] ( http://www.gtspirit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/romanian-police-gets-jaguar-xfr-01.jpg ) and [ these ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/romanian-police-car-27576898.jpg ) . 
  i would love to live in a place like that , 
  glad you like it , and hope to see you again !, 
  thank you , 
  [ 13 second timelapse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puxg1ytrkp4&amp;list=uuakggqlzrlxuv9pkmii_keg ) i took a few weeks ago . 
  do n't lie . 
  this was taken yesterday . 
  i know you swedes ... 
  i watch `` welcom to sweden '', 
  apply cold water to burned area . 
  yep . 
  romania is the 4th highest country in the world for quality of life of software developers , after uk , us and germany . 
  are you sure you are in germany ? 
  i see / u/egozid 's reply much more * german * . 
  you 'd think that that 's a joke , but it is n't . 
  in romania you get 1gbps for about 13 euros, 
  depends on your job . 
  if you work in it , with an average romanian salary you would live better than in norway with a bigger salary . 
  i 'm starting to like you #nohomo . 
  free parking spot !, 
  yes and yes , 
  i agree with you on all points , but , as under any circumstance , being `` that kid in class '' , makes you look like a douche ( no offence ) . 
  why do you say it 's a dying language ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken , it 's the second official language in europe . 
  actually , i would recommend coming to transylvania , not only / r/transylvania, 
  lol, 
  you sir do not appreciate fine butter !, 
  you made me burst my milk out my nose . 
  sorry , but that song was a cheap james bond theme knock-off . 
  you sir !, 
  hey , they were actually good !, 
  i shall wait then . 
  actually , when i was a kid we did that in my home town . 
  have no idea where it came from . 
  my girlfriend is hungarian !, 
  * going to grab a bucket . 
  yep . 
  at least in bucovina , there were some people making them . 
  we had them for a few years . 
  same here . 
  in romania we eat lamb roast and we dye eggs red . 
  these is specific to easter . 
  otherwise , holiday food : [ sarmale ] ( http://ow.ly/vxmkx ) , [ mancare rece ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=mancarica+rece&amp;oq=mancarica+rece&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2379j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=2&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=utf-8#q=mancare+rece ) , [ salata de boeuf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salat%c4%83_de_boeuf ) and for desert [ cozonac ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cozonac ) and [ pasca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pasc%c4%83 ), 
  not really . 
  `` sarcini '' is tasks . 
  same in romania, 
  errands,

  france is very racist towards eastern europe . 
  you should n't really expect compassion when you still treat other nations like crap . 
  the jungle book, 
  should be . 
  it 's better than the current carphatian gardens . 
  now it 's nice , with much less weird . 
  the city is great . 
  very young due to the universities , very multicultural due to the many ethnicities . 
  you should at least come and visit , 
  it 's the greatest city [ you 've never heard of ] ( http://www.bestcityineurope.com/welcome/ ) . 
  and the european youth capital this year . 
  so pretty much downtown is expensive , and also buying your own land anywhere in the city is expensive . 
  but other than the city center , prices are pretty decent . 
  last year i bought my apartment via loan , and i got a 3 bedroom , 67 square meters , 2 balconies , 2 bathrooms with 56k euro , and in a decent neighborhood ( the best if you ask me ) . 
  but that was last year . 
  this year , of what i hear , you ca n't find under 1000 euros per square meter . 
  [ i got that reference !, 
  in cluj-napoca , romania you can get [ this ] ( http://olx.ro/oferta/casa-5-camera-160-mp-teren-800-mp-interservisan-id2vt27.html#7b89be5bfe ) little cozy house , or an apartment in the [ city center ] ( http://olx.ro/oferta/apartament-de-lux-in-zona-ultracentrala-piata-matei-corvin-id4mf1u.html#7b89be5bfe ), 
  spoiler alert : the shepherd died . 
  [ nope ] ( http://memecrunch.com/meme/15mxy/anchorman/image.png ), 
  i can only imagine a german stealing a bike because he saw something he could fix/improve . 
  do n't worry . 
  you 'll probably get it back with an electric motor or something . 
  lol , sure bro . 
   if it was a german car , it would n't have broken down . 
  yeah , lol , when both are actually asian ... 
  [ this is my wireless ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/7sfdgci834b7tdg/screenshot%202015-05-14%2019.38.29.png?dl=0 ) edit : 8 euros, 
  everybody should treat religion as he or she sees fit . 
  edit : and also , traditional easter eggs in romania are red , and the famous `` incondeiate '' eggs . 
  all fair and true facts , but besides my initial statement . 
  is it a free day tomorrow because it 's the end of winter or a christian holiday ? 
   pretty much everyone accepts that explanation is religious backpedaling . 
  this i did not understand . 
  based on your statement i imagine you are pretty young . 
  well , when i was a kid , we did n't have any sort of rabbits , and eggs were dyed only red http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_egg#christian_traditions, 
  i 'm sorry , there must be some confusion . 
  here we celebrate a christian holiday , and not the end of winter . 
  just how on the 24th of december we celebrate another religious holiday , and not the roman holiday of saturnalia . 
  and here we do n't actually have a rabbit in our traditions , that 's something we brought over like we did with valentines day , but the eggs do have a significance : it is said that a woman brought a basket of eggs at the feet of the crucified jesus . 
  when the centurion stabbed him with the spear , the blood covered the eggs . 
  that 's why , traditionally in romania , we dye the eggs red . 
  of course !, 
  bon appetit to that lamb !, 
  of course !, 
  sadly it is n't the reason tomorrow is a free day , so i hope you 'll do your best at pushing those carts tomorrow at work !,
