being all passive . 
  what are you supposed to do at a peaceful protest ? 
  asking in all seriousness , i 've never been to another protest before , so what else is there to do outside of chanting and holding signs , thus asking for what you want and showing the world what 's happening ? 
  i do n't know how people would define `` feeling european '' when you , in fact , * are * european . 
  it 's like being a man and asked if you actually feel like a man . 
  it seems to me that this whole `` feeling european '' promotes differences and it makes people who do n't share much history with other european countries to feel disconnected and less european . 
  see the users from northern countries who responded here . 
  it 's not ok . you 're a part of europe and that 's it . 
  we should n't be encouraged to doubt that , to judge if we * feel * european . 
  i see , thanks !, 
  wow , i 'd love to taste that kind of bread , if only they 'll ever bake such a thing here . 
  are n't they more similar to donuts ? 
  shops in romania sell them alongside donuts , i always thought they were like a different type of donut . 
  all his fish thieves are probably white and male as well , he should ban them too . 
  gypsies consist of about 3 % of romanians , so they could n't have skewed the numbers so badly just by themselves . 
  oh i see , so it does n't have to be the last name . 
  thank you !, 
   if your fathers name is sigurjon , your last name becomes sigurjonson or sigurjonsdottir depending on your gender then what will sigurjonson 's son be named ? 
  i 'll have to assume it wo n't be sigurjonsonson , what happens then ? 
  haha , it 's a blessing in disguise to have a family member or an so to eat the left overs . 
  my boyfriend does n't mind one bit when we go out to eat and he `` has to '' finish what i get . 
   when i was a kid my parents made us eat everything on the plate to show how nice it was and be polite , whereas in some families they like to leave a little on the plate to show they 're full and there 's no need for extra . 
  interesting , i did n't know that . 
  wish it worked in romania !, 
  here , there 's the custom of serving your guests * a lot * of food , no matter how much they protest , and it 's best to eat everything to show how good it was , like in your family . 
  i ca n't eat much and it 's a pain when going on a visit . 
  * roll over belly up *, 
  uk is the first at household ... 
  i recently saw a tv show about teaching parents to cook healthy meals for their kids and there was a ( wealthy ) british family with 5 kids who , after dinner , simply threw away all the leftovers and there was plenty of food left . 
  i wondered if it 's something common or it was just those people , but the numbers here say it 's common ... 
  ugh , i wish , but it wo n't be too soon because the politicians are corrupt and really do n't care enough yet about this to do anything . 
   is this an important issue amongst romanians ? 
  yes , but not because of faith , but because the public just found out exactly how much money the state stuffs into the church 's pockets . 
  basically , the church 's staff is paid about double what our doctors are paid , nevermind the building of a cathedral worth 6mil euros with public money and other insanely expensive churches . 
  only extremists approve of that , most people are enraged because come on , we do n't have money for decent hospitals , but we have plenty to build fancy cathedrals in which we can pray that we do n't die in shitty hospitals . 
  also , the trust in the church has dropped over the years . 
  the church is losing its credibility because it keeps doing stupid things that even the believers do n't approve of : they interfered in the proceedings of a famous person 's funeral - the guy wanted to be incinerated , the church protested that he should be buried or else no priest will do the funeral sermon or whatever it 's called . 
  it was a huge fuss . 
  the church also started making its own brand of candles , approved and blessed by the church , obviously . 
  they protested against the use of the cross on manhole covers and against privately owned cemeteries . 
  and others that i ca n't remember or articulate properly at this hour . 
  basically , it 's not a matter of faith , of belief in god , it 's a matter of the church as an institution being a piece of work . 
  believers do n't like what 's happening either , let alone atheists , so that 's what might drive romania to put a stop to sponsoring the church with public money . 
  off the top of my head : the romans , the ottomans , the byzantine empire + the mongols and various other countries . 
  i only recall one conflict we started , and that was with the bulgarians to take a land they got back in the end . 
  other than that , romania was pretty much like a small brother bullied out of his toys and out of his own room . 
  romania 's flag in its natural environment would look macabre : red - ground splattered with puddles of blood ( of the heroes that defended the country ) ; yellow - a wheat field ; blue - a river in the distance . 
  we were invaded a little too much . 
  oh , there are a dozen sites for that , i 'm subscribed to a few and i 've actually run into some pretty good books like [ this one ] ( http://www.amazon.com/angel-death-row-penalty-defense/dp/1607144344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1346255106&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=angel+of+death+row ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.amazon.com/power-habit-what-life-business/dp/1400069289/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1346255137&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=power+of+habit ) that i found when they were free for a couple of days . 
  if possible , invest in an e-reader like the kindle . 
  amazon is a gold mine and their prices are good even for romanian standards . 
  and long live public libraries !, 
  i miss the one from pitesti . 
   poor journalism on reuters ' part . 
  exactly . 
  the official results are n't even out yet , and reuters wrote about the victory * yesterday * : sun jul 29 , 2012 6:29 pm edt . 
  to be fair , i have no idea who authorized that money-sucking pile of concrete . 
  i recently read that the [ orthodox church had more profit last year than mcdonald 's had in romania ] ( http://translate.google.ro/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=es&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.realitatea.net%2fpatriarhia-romana-a-avut-un-profit-mai-mare-decat-mcdonald-s-in-2011_969137.html ) . 
  the church is supported by the state and i believe it had a * big * word to say about building that cathedral . 
  there was a wave of rage in romanians when we first heard about it , most people argued that `` the money they put into that cathedral should 've gone towards the dying medical system '' , but nobody cared about our protests . 
  no , the exact question at the census was `` to which religion do you think you belong to ? '', 
  ( [ here ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/p.pdf ) , it 's in romanian , somebody linked you before ) . 
  i really wish they asked about personal belief and not about religion , i 'm 100 % sure the graph would 've been completely different . 
   to this question people will respond with the general `` faith '' in their family , which simply means they were baptized ( or whatever ) and possibly married in such church or the other . 
  precisely . 
  i have many many friends my age who genuinely do n't care about religion and said they answered `` orthodox '' at the census because that 's their `` official '' religion , even if they do n't practice it . 
  they 're packed mostly with the elderly and the less privileged . 
  not to say that adults do n't go there , but they 're not the majority . 
  i honestly believe that most romanians are agnostics ( they do n't care or think about religion much ) or `` light '' christians as i call them - the ones that honestly believe in god , but only go to church on special occasions . 
   the orthodox church definitely did n't have it so bad since it rebounded so fast after the revolution , while the catholic church ( especially greek catholicism , which was prevalent in transylvania ) has almost completely disappeared . 
  romanians are mostly orthodox , so i 'm not surprised . 
  as for attending mass on easter and celebrating christmas , that 's about the most they do . 
  i think easter and christmas have turned into cultural traditions rather than religious celebrations . 
  it 's mostly cultural , plenty of people say they 're orthodox because they were raised that way even though they do n't generally care about religion , do n't go to church , do n't practice their religion . 
  only the elderly are truly religious , you 'd rarely see young folk in a church . 
  i do n't get why you got downvoted , everything you said was true . 
  romania is so religious partly because it was a form of survival , of defiance , you said it well , of the dictatorship . 
  and romania resembles slovakia with being `` cultural christians '' as well - i know plenty of people who label themselves as orthodox , but do n't practice their religion . 
  here , the most religious are the elderly , rarely will you see young adults in a church . 
  thus , romania has a national anthem about protecting itself and standing up to invaders - [ here it is in english , the long version ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de%c8%99teapt%c4%83-te,_rom%c3%a2ne!#original_verses_in_romanian ) . 
  not quite accurate . 
  romania is * swimming * in metal bands , but since national labels seem to think that metal and most branches of rock wo n't bring them profit , the bands tend to stay underground . 
  zdob si zdub ca n't be beat , but this year 's song was catchy and really good too . 
   i ca n't wait for the satw comic about this ... ha , me neither , [ the comic when satellite won ] ( http://satwcomic.com/eurovision-2010 ) was great , but i ca n't seem to find one for last year 's contest ... 
  i loved the dude 's voice !, 
  too bad it was too soft to win , but eurovision is now known for the quality it promotes . 
  yet google says [ hungarians are gypsies ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ezn0a.png ) . 
  now that 's a twist . 
  how does * that * spark into someone 's brain , though ? 
   `` kurac '' means cock in croatian and serbian , but it is used in coloquial conversation as a comma , punctuation mark , universal pronoun , much like `` fuck '' is in english , yet you ca n't hear it on television . 
  that makes all talk on television seem incredibly uptight , official , insincere and unauthentic . 
  huh . 
  in romania , many people tend to use `` ce pula mea '' or `` baga-mi-as pula '' like a comma ( sort of * what the cock * and * stick my cock * ) , yet here it is still considered an annoyance . 
   `` pizda '' , however , is a sinonym for `` pi\u010dka '' that is considerd slimy and disgusting , and refering to any woman as `` pizda '' in any situation whatsoever is simply unthinkable . 
  women can refer to their own sex organs as `` pizda '' but it is ment to show disdain and provoke unease . 
  guys however get called a `` pizda '' often , and it means they are gullible , naive or bitchy . 
  it 's the same in romanian , same word , same meanings . 
  wow . 
  this whole read is fascinating . 
  hopefully , they only have one partner for a long time .
