you are entitled to your own opinions , not your own facts . 
  you are however not entitled to stand without correction of your counterfactual opinions . 
  i agree with that statement . 
  sadly enough but people are being called racist too easily in these times ( regarding the refugee crisis ) . 
  from my point of view , i ** really ** , ** really ** , ** really ** want all this shitstorm to end well . 
  but at the rate civil unrest is going , all the videos going online with some of the refugee being assholes and countries not being able to apply the law because it 's deemed racist , excuse me , but i wo n't be holding my breath . 
  my statement about `` i 'm off '' was n't meant as a refusal to discuss with y' all ( wanted to make that clear ) . 
  what i managed to translate from that draft you linked , all i could think of was the fact that that paper ( being xenophobic and racist as you say ) wrote a fake story about the alleged gang rape ? 
  they even quote policeman : aftonbladet has talked with s\u00f6dermalm police station officer carl lauffs . 
  - they are minors . 
  i know no more details of the case , says lauffs . '', 
  if they indeed faked it , they should be seeing some charges, 
  one of your fellow swede posted it somewhere in / r/europe . 
  and since when people are n't entitled to an opinion ? 
  suddenly , hungary is getting all the shit from eu because they want to enforce the law ( how dare they do a check for all those immigrants that want to pass freely through europe , damn racists thats what they are ) . 
  now a site posting that a gangrape happened is too extreme right winged . 
  i 'm off, 
   have fallen and remained low over the last ** 50 years ** sadly enough , i ca n't read that , i do n't know the language . 
  but i do believe what you are saying . 
  i do n't want sweden to become a hell-hole , seeing how many people are going over there . 
  in romania we do have some high unemployment rates for the gypsy population because they are quite reluctant to integrate in the society . 
  if you say the crime rates have remained low for 50years , great on them , that means they have a nice society ( in the last 50 years ) from which only 20years where in the eu . 
  let 's see if the rates will remain low, 
  again with the double wrongs . 
  i 'm romanian , and i 'm sure you can find a bunch of examples but from what / r/europe , and especially sweden redditors are saying , they are truly screwed . 
  here 's another article on that matter . 
  http://www.jihadwatch.org/2014/04/when-it-comes-to-rapes-islamized-sweden-is-already-in-a-state-of-war hell , i know lots of our gypsies migrated north for easy money and welfare but i have yet to see an article about violent crimes against the people of the land . 
  initially , the anger was towards piedone , the mayor of the district in which the tragedy happened . 
  before that , people were mad of oprea ( a minister in the government , for the escorting policeman death ) . 
  to be honest , his resignation came as a big surprise . 
  very big surprise . 
  i doubt anyone was expecting it . 
  people protested last night towards those 2 ( piedone , oprea ) . 
  but those two fuckwits did n't have a spine to resign . 
  i know its hard to understand , and i am having real difficulties trying to explain how we got here with this clusterfuck of political spews , but each and every deceitful thing ponta did , his party did kept adding and adding and adding . 
  i 'm sorry i ca n't give a clear snapshot of the situation but all the suppressed anger tipped off with this fire . 
  maybe other people can give more details on this . 
  maybe coaming through this post might give more info . 
  the anger is directed towards this dude because , till recently , he was also the leader of the usl party which was another group of lowlifes . 
  having clear majority in parliament and having ponta as president would have been romanias worst nightmare in 2014 ( when klaus iohannis won ) . 
  and in regards to your positive view about the government , i 'll give it to ponta , he did make some good moves ( lowering the vat , rising some salaries for medics , teachers and such ) . 
  but that just was n't enough to clear his name . 
  from my point of view , he took one for the team . 
  i do n't think his resignation will end up like he would think ( all things will settle down and romanians will forget all about the corruption ) . 
  people are happy he left because more and more were asking for his resignation . 
  he is being prosecuted right now for lots of things . 
  hell , other pms resigned for less . 
  in ending , while i do agree you have a point about the randomness of things ( a fire tragedy leading to the fall of a countries ' government ) , the fall was due a long time . 
  people that protested last night wanted justice to be served . 
  i sure hope good things will come of this tho . 
  have any good tehnocrats willing to occupy a government position in a south eastern europe country ? 
  have a read over here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victor_ponta because seeing 32 ( and counting ) people ( young people ) being burnt alive and 130 critical has a very strong effect on people . 
  i know i wept when seeing all the confessions . 
  it 's heart-breaking . 
  i know you can say that people die more than that on streets , in auto accidents daily , and you 'll be right . 
  but those do n't have the same impact . 
  those young people went to a concert and ended up in a body bag . 
  they had absolutely no blame in this . 
  people driving know they are exposing themselves to a risk when running 100kmh on roads . 
  imainge you , going in a pub and ( god forbid ) , it burns to the ground . 
  i know that was went through my mind when i saw the disaster . 
  he is the image of the `` its good enough '' man . 
  when basescu was president , ponta had a meeting with him about some imf loan . 
  this was his attention span : https://imgur.com/8z6l1ug he had no problem when people outside of romania complained and complained in 2014 presidential elections . 
  lots of expats were not able to vote . 
  he was pm then , he knew elections were coming , he knew how many expats there are , but he did jackshit to prepare for the mass of people that wanted to vote . 
  he has a very dismissive attitude . 
  there were several acts like that ( corrupt laws , each one of them covering each others back , he denied the construction of a very important highway ( which our ford/dacia plants really need to still be competitive on the market , lots of people working in those plants ) but he accepted the construction of a highway in one of his henchmens ' district . 
  he rushed to grand opening of a highway on 14th nov 2014 ( i think ) , right before the 2nd ballot of presidential voting , only so that he will be there and gloat at his realisation `` look guys , i 'm giving you a highway , now vote me '' . 
  guess what , that highway now is being decomissioned because it 's unsafe ( some structural layers are missing ) and is very dangerous for public safety ( basically , its going down-hill , literally ) . 
  as you can see , those examples did n't imply direct deaths . 
  i 'm not denying his actions had some indirect effects on some people ( even death maybe ) , but the nightclub disaster deaths i can relate with . 
  call me a hypocrite , but that 's why i think the nightclub disaster was the straw that broke the camels ' back . 
  people have had it with the corruption ( they had several tries at making corruption legal , by law ), 
  the night club disaster was the tipping point . 
  ponta did a lot of shady things : forgery , fraud , plagiarism for which he is being prosecuted for . 
  and many more . 
  that with all the corruption involved ( several government emergency ordinances to cover their shit ) . 
  i 'm tuning in the news and even the journalists are saying its quite tough to explain to someone which resides outside of romania how can a nightclub fire can lead to the fall of a government . 
  all i can say , he had it coming from long time ago . 
  a quick search on google got me several ministers and pms that resigned from `` trivial '' things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_resignations_from_government the pm of south korea resigned when a ferry capsized : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chung_hong-won a policeman , escorting ( an official escort ) the minister of internal affairs in his fricking trip to the barber , died . 
  try to imagine that . 
  that minister had over 1600 escorts this year only . 
  in my point of view , ponta took one for the team . 
  but the results wo n't be as he expected . 
  the people really dislike his party and his acolytes . 
  thanks . 
  it 's the straw taht broke it, 
  thanks . 
  being the leader of the executive power in a country , you have the responsibility to have the parliaments law be enforced . 
  when you are the boss ( lets say ) of all local city hall leaders ( mayors ) and those mayors are going haywire left and right , not doing their jobs ( while you are helping them do that , or just leaving them alone doing their corrupt things ) , it really is your fault and you should resign . 
  the people have always manifested against the corruption in different city halls ( hell , i 'd say more than 50 % are dirty ) and if you , as a pm , the boss of those mayors do jack shit to make it clear , you have some blame to it . 
  later news , the mayor of bucharests sector 4 resigned too ( the infamous piedone ) . 
  that just enhances my point . 
  it 's a fricking domino effect . 
  and i 'm liking it . 
  even if its going the other way ( the big fishes ( ponta ) falling first , and barely afterwards the small ones are falling ) , its great news . 
  now all i can hope no new shitstains will take their spots, 
  see / u/rurikton link and my explanations for it . 
  there will surely be more articles in due time this too : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rdp3w/more_than_10000_people_gather_in_bucharest/cwn87w8,
