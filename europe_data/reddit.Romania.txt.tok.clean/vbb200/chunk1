holly hell , do those words look strange written together !, 
  you 're right . 
  fucking up an army , on the other hand ... 
  it is good because it sends the message that this kind of behavior is not allowed in europe . 
  serbia is a european country after all . 
  haha . 
  the serbs will fuck them up . 
  romania , by any chance ? 
  the suits do n't fit . 
  they 're too big . 
  who dresses these guys ? 
  they could do a better job , imo . 
  * acute lead poisoning, 
  paris is filthy . 
  fuck her right in the pussy . 
  bulz is the shit !, 
  at first i was surprised that i understood some of those words . 
  then it hit me : most of them are romanian . 
  shit 's fucked up . 
  0 % blood alcohol is what i call ` master race ' . 
  the title says ` apartments ' . 
  are there no houses in poland ? 
  i like your analogies . 
  ukraine and moldova are no longer satellites . 
  each country where orthodoxy is predominant has its own orthodox church . 
  that 's why you 've heard of the russian orthodox , greek orthodox , romanian orthodox , bulgarian orthodox , serbian orthodox church etc. 
  regarding doctrine , it 's basically identical . 
  it 's also very similar to the catholic doctrine ( the great schism in 1054 and all that ) . 
  they each have their own '' pope '' called a patriarch . 
  another interesting thing is the existence , in romania at least , of the greek catholic church . 
  it 's almost identical to the orthodox one but it 's '' rulled '' by the pope . 
  christian ( mostly orthodox ) . 
  sadly , i ca n't see your flair . 
  i was referring to romania . 
  the majority of romanians support the church so the government is , more or less , obligated to respect the people 's will : to back up the church . 
  and yes , in romania the state is not completely separated from the church . 
  you forgot to mention bribes . 
  there is nothing wrong in supporting those things . 
  the bad thing is that they are doing it just to get votes . 
  after that , they say `` fuck it '' and do whatever they want . 
  he ai n't got shit on goku , my friend . 
  but is n't vegeta cancer ? 
  i agree with you . 
  i was comparing cluj with most of the cities in romania . 
  also , i 've been to other countries and some were indeed cleaner but some were not . 
  breathing some of that sweet , sweet air right now . 
  come on , man . 
  it 's pretty clean . 
  `` dna is an independent entity in its reports with the courts , with the prosecutor 's offices attached to these courts , as well as in its relations with the other public authorities . '',

  give them time . 
  naa . 
  we do n't get money because we do n't ask for it . 
  ooh , you poor bastard . 
  sadly , the majority of those gangs are made up of romanian gypsies . 
  and people hear only the first part . 
  i 've read somewhere that out currency is called `` leu '' because lions used to live around these parts . 
  we stronk, 
  i agree . 
  it was a good day . 
  if it 's ok for my rights to be taken away than it 's ok to occupy a central square and throw firebombs at the police . 
  power to the people !, 
  so you think a child has the mental capacity to choose if he lives or dies ? 
  this is fucked up on so many levels . 
  mainly for the higher wages . 
  the lack of medical instruments and generally poor working conditions does n't help either . 
  i do n't know how medicine is taught in ireland but here med school lasts 6 years . 
  the last 3 years are clinical years but students can talk to patients , attend surgeries or other procedures from the very beginning . 
  you are correct . 
  also another thing that attracts them is direct access to patients whilst they are still in school . 
  not many universities offer that . 
  yup . 
  also a lot of swedes . 
  behave . 
  i have n't heard of italian students but i have a lot of french and swedish colleagues !, 
  where does this gas come from ? 
  hear hear !, 
  all kidding aside : `` by 1900 it had the largest economy in europe , a factor that played a major role in its entry into world war i and world war ii . '',

  time for another world war !, 
  people have to pay you money in order to label products like : champagne , cognac ... also , you guys like to eat snails and frog legs .

  judging by your spelling you do n't deserve a job , moron . 
  edit : you 've changed `` there '' to `` there 're '' . 
  way to go , cunt !, 
  edit : not so fast , cunt !, 
  that and the lack of education in general . 
  you say that you moved here . 
  then you must have noticed that a lot of the population lives in rural areas . 
  actually about [ half ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/romania/rural-population-percent-of-total-population-wb-data.html ) of the population . 
  these girls have basically zero knowledge of family planning . 
  so they get pregnant at a very young age and what do they do ... they get abortions .
