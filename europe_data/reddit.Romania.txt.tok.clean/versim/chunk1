when was the attack supposed to have occurred ? 
  if the light shoving at the end qualifies as an `` attack '' , then i 've been serially assaulted each time i 've taken the subway . 
  a dump by any other name would smell as sour . 
  the last people remaining on a sinking ship usually are n't the highest-quality ones . 
  they should file a class-action lawsuit together with estonia . 
  very little . 
  i know they feature in the following the following communist-era joke :  a romanian , a latvian , and an american are discussing their diets . 
  the romanian brags : `` thanks to the mechanization of our agriculture , the modern romanian eats 2000 calories per day . '', 
  the latvian scoffs : `` hah !, 
  we have managed to increase consumption to 2500 calories per day . '', 
  the american says : `` that 's nothing . 
  we americans eat 3000 calories per day . '', 
  the latvian is incredulous : `` that 's impossible !, 
  no-one can eat that many potatoes ! '', 
  so i guess they produce a lot of potatoes ? 
  do n't be mad once you see that serbia wants your flag . 
  if you liked it , then you should have put a coat of arms on it . 
  is anything made on purpose ? 
  or are all man 's creations just the product of the remorseless laws of physics applied to an accidental arrangement of matter in an indifferent void ? 
  you do n't need to lick them -- there are * manlier * ( in a manner of speaking ) adhesives that you can use . 
  why must these maps keep bringing up the molotov-ribbentrop pact ? 
   we both want the pillar of hercules really bad  friendship between nations is important . 
  do n't let hercules 's pillar come between your two countries . 
  the carpathians are quite beautiful -- i consider them the poor man 's alps . 
  but you 'll have to watch out for bears , wolves , and shepherds ' dogs ( which are trained to fight the aforementioned bears and wolves , and so are not very friendly ) -- if you manage to get there at all . 
  we rank last in the eu for the quality of our road and rail systems , and the government acts as though timetables , touristic information , and the like are closely guarded state secrets . 
  nothing is available on the internet . 
  even finding out whether your train is delayed requires filling out two forms in triplicate , while a clerk suspiciously studies your face , trying to discern your nefarious purpose . 
  why are you asking so many questions about the delay ? 
  are you perhaps responsible for the delay ? 
  yes , i 'm exaggerating slightly : romania is a fine place to visit . 
  but there exist more attractive destinations nearby ( in croatia and slovenia , for example ) . 
  perhaps for these reasons , romania has by [ far ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/6/6c/tourism_intensity%2c_2015_%28nights_spent_by_residents_and_non-residents_at_tourist_accommodation_establishments_per_inhabitant%29_v2.png ) the fewest tourists per capita in the eu . 
  it is a beautiful country with a sunny climate , architecturally stunning cities , and excellent beaches . 
  as a result , swarms of tourists descend on spain each year . 
  mallorca has fallen to the germans , while the british are holed up in gibraltar , biding their time and sending the occasional pensioner further afield . 
  spanish residents who are fed up with the sheer number of tourists are advised to consult with romania , the eu leader in tourist deterrence . 
  that sounds like an uneducated viewpoint , comrade . 
  but do n't worry : your thinking will soon be corrected through children 's patriotic re-education . 
  no problem . 
  we 'll just allow people to identify as skunks , so that they can spatter such intruders with their bodily fluids . 
  keep `` making up ground '' at this rate and you might just become as `` competitive '' as us . 
  how dare you suggest that we stage protests at the slightest provocation ? 
  i hereby summon all romanians to the polish embassy to protest such polish slanderousness starting at 16:00 . 
  participants are asked to stay for the protests in solidarity with the polish people , which will continue as scheduled at 18:00 . 
  al jazeera has both an english-language service and an arabic-language service . 
  in my experience , the english-language service is quite decent and without any religious bias ( although it does have a slight left-wing bias ) . 
  i can not vouch for the arabic-language service , however . 
  we have a hungarian enclave in central romania which occasionally agitates for greater autonomy . 
  our version of the above joke goes :  a hungarian boy marries a romanian girl , and asks his father how to act on their wedding night . 
   `` first , son , you must carry the bride in your arms across the threshold . 
  then , you must lay her gently upon the bed and remove your clothes . 
  after that ... well , i trust you 'll know how to proceed . '', 
   when the boy comes to breakfast the next morning , the father asks him how it went . 
   `` first , i carried my wife in my arms across the threshold , just like you said . '', 
   `` good , good , and then ? '', 
   `` i gently lay her upon the bed and removed my clothes . '', 
   `` excellent , excellent , and then ? '', 
   `` i masturbated furiously and ejaculated upon my wife . '', 
   `` what ?!, 
  why the devil did you do that ? '', 
   `` to show her that the hungarian is autonomous and independent ! '', 
  twice ? 
  did you enjoy coming again ? 
  convicted witches . 
  crosses are prohibited in many romanian schools to avoid offending students who happen to be vampires . 
  trigger warning : the netherlands is referred to as holland ( olanda ) . 
  why is the rate for the balkans so much lower than the rate for all the balkan countries listed ? 
  are there tons of law-abiding croatians in germany that make up for the rest of us ? 
  if i understand correctly , the `` work efficiency '' purports to measure the profit an employer makes off an employee ( the higher the blue number , the more valuable an employee 's labor relative to the cost of hiring that employee ) . 
  but the salary is measured nominally while the productivity is adjusted for purchasing power parity , which may magnify the differences between different countries . 
  i 'm not sure how things are in belgium , but in countries like the uk ( not to mention romania ) there are even greater shortages of teachers and nurses . 
  here you go . 
  it 's on the house . 
  it sounds bad , but let 's wait to hear the full context . 
  he might have continued : '' ... insofar as scumbags are useful but under-appreciated components of a healthy society . 
  and to clear up a point of confusion : use * my * name to wipe your traitorous gobs and my * brother 's * name to wipe your sanctimonious fannies . '', 
  that sucks . 
  romania is a strong democracy : we 're led by a con-man and his drunkard puppet , exactly as the electorate wanted . 
  the british certainly found an interesting way to give 'em [ both barrels ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/%22give%27em_both_barrels%22_-_nara_-_513619.jpg ) . 
  they 're worthy adversaries in the battle for last place in the eu league tables . 
  i do n't know -- mountain ranges can be wide , so you would have to decide where along the mountain chain the border should be drawn . 
  it would make more sense to have borders follow major rivers . 
  perhaps ... the danube ? 
  although the two are unrelated , it is interesting to note that while the us was in the midst of the great depression , the ussr underwent a [ famine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) which resulted in approximately 5 million deaths . 
  `` consumers '' it is , then . 
  no -- the only source of fake news is soros . 
  hello , mr. reddit . 
  you showed me a funny picture of a dog , once . 
  now i want to purchase that dog . 
  can i into e-commerce ? 
  the percentages given in the article are off by a factor of 10 . 
  sweden 's population only increased by 1.4 % , germany 's by 0.76 % , and so on . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8102195/3-10072017-ap-en.pdf/a61ce1ca-1efd-41df-86a2-bb495daabdab ) is the actual data . 
  here 's another pair : [ stockholm ] ( https://en.aegeanair.com/-/media/destinations/stockholm/stockholm_final_cover.jpg ) vs. [ bucharest ] ( https://www.romaniaexperience.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ferentari-bucharest-dangerous-place-02.jpg ) . 
  it really makes you wonder why more western europeans are n't moving to eastern europe . 
  so poland has a low level of human development because they 're so high all the time ? 
  perhaps germany could host an international gathering of some sort to show those anarchistic poles how to behave in an orderly fashion . 
  according to [ oecd data ] ( https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm ) , greece has seen an even steeper decline in productivity , and italy has been stagnating for longer than the uk . 
  as an eastern european , i very much disagree with the immigration policies of western europe , but i agree that they are miles ahead of us in terms of european values .
