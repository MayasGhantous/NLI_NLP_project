  at this rate , i expect romania to enter the 21st century in about 100 years . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  if all preliminary results are indeed reviewed by an independent commission , i do n't see what the fuss is about . 
  as long as voters can be sure that their votes will be fairly counted in the end , it hardly matters whether there are some errors at the beginning . 
  however , your explanation for the discrepancies does n't seem particularly likely ( unless i 'm misinformed ) . 
  from what i understand , the afd is much more popular than miscellaneous other parties whose names may sound similar ( e.g. , the add ) . 
  so if someone says `` the a?d won 7 % of the vote and the a?d won 1 % '' , and you ca n't hear the second initials due to a poor telephone connection , it would beggar belief to assume that the add won 7 % and the afd won 1 % . 
  also , if you find yourself thinking `` that 's impossible -- nobody could be so stupid !, 
  '' , you should probably think again . 
  one explanation for the discrepancy is that some vote-counters refused to count votes for the afd in the second round . 
  is there a better explanation for the discrepancy or is there some mechanism in germany for detecting such fraud ? 
  because if such fraud can and does occur without detection , and if an * enormous * scandal does not ensue , then germany can no longer be considered a democratic country . 
  second-rate ? 
  trump is the bigliest dictator you 've ever seen -- absolutely tremendous !, 
  yes . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/kdh58pc ) is a chart comparing the net emigration rate per 1000 people in romania ( blue ) with that in portugal ( green ) . 
  the data is taken from [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tsdde230&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=data ) . 
  note that when romania acceded to the eu in 2007 , over 1 in 50 of its citizens left . 
  while countries like portugal have been bleeding population for a few years , romania has been hemorrhaging population for a few decades . 
  however , while it certainly is a huge issue , it seems to have more or less stabilized since 2010 . 
  well , that 's one way to end the dispute between romania and hungary over transylvania . 
  ok , she 's about to become a vampire , but is she single ? 
  yes , the blame for the holocaust needs to be put where it belongs : on the people who accepted the people who rejected hitler from art school to art school . 
  let me get this straight . 
  you watched a commercial about a man delivering a halting monologue to no-one in particular while someone wearing a bear suit sneaks into his cab , and the aspect of it that struck you as weird was that it was * self-deprecating * ? 
   my definition of optimal is `` maximising total payoff '' . 
  this is quite possible . 
  right , but your total payoff is a function of your strategy * and * your opponents ' strategies . 
  there is no such thing as the total payoff of a particular strategy . 
   tit-for-tat is the in between of compliant and extortionate strategies . 
  you can almost always beat it ( up to probabilistic degeneration ) in large populations with a compliant strategy how so ? 
  when matched against compliant opponents , a player implementing a tit-for-tat strategy will always cooperate , and all players will receive the same payoff . 
  in any event , we seem to agree that the most successful strategies involve punishing defection , though we might disagree about how often and/or to what extent defection should be punished . 
   deliberately altering to a defection-dominated based strategy minimises payoff for both players , and is exceptionally foolish . 
  but there are n't two players -- there are 28 players . 
  the reason for taking a hardline stance on brexit negotiations is to prevent * other * members of the eu from defecting . 
  and this can only be accomplished if the uk 's payoff from leaving the eu is quite negative indeed . 
  there is no such thing as an `` optimal '' position in an iterated prisoner 's dilemma , as the success of one 's strategy depends on the strategies adopted by one 's opponents . 
  however , the `` tit-for-tat '' strategy is generally quite successful against a variety of opposing strategies , while strategies which do n't punish defection fare quite poorly . 
  britain has defected , so game theory counsels the eu to show that such defection is not advantageous . 
  to be fair to her , the uk will only leave the eu after she graduates ( unless may conducts brexit negotiations at warp speed ) , so she may have hoped to secure a job while still a eu citizen . 
  it 's not unreasonable to expect that british citizens currently working for european institutions ( and eu citizens working for the british civil service ) will be allowed to remain at their posts even after brexit . 
  the article is much funnier if you imagine that `` davy '' is some random bloke they interviewed in the street . 
  do n't they want to get revenge on those lazy romanians for stealing british jobs ? 
  this is a chance to see how we like it when the shoe 's on the other foot . 
   ( we 'd be rather keen on it , actually . ), 
  i have no problem with germany being welcoming to african and middle eastern immigrants -- they 're a rich country and have resources to spend on integrating them into society . 
  but even with all these resources , immigration has caused substantial social problems , including increasing crime , welfare dependency , and far-right sentiment among the native population . 
  if even germany is susceptible to these problems , imagine the impact on eastern europe , which is far poorer than germany and lacks strong democratic traditions . 
  when we joined the eu , we signed up for uncontrolled immigration from other european countries ; we did not sign up for uncontrolled immigration from africa and the middle east , and germany has no right to force such immigration upon us . 
  studies [ show ] ( http://giovanniperi.ucdavis.edu/uploads/5/6/8/2/56826033/labor_market_beerli_peri_2015.pdf ) that immigration from eu countries has had * no * effect on swiss wages . 
  this stands to reason : immigration increases the supply of labor , but it also increases the demand for goods ; the two tend to cancel each other out . 
  so people must have some * other * reason for opposing immigration . 
  perhaps they , like you , are not fond of the additional construction occurring in their country . 
  but this seems unlikely : anti-immigration swiss politicians do not rant about environmental protections , but about expelling [ black ] ( https://qz.com/617050/switzerlands-largest-political-party-insists-on-depicting-foreigners-as-black-sheep/ ) sheep from the country . 
  yes , switzerland has accepted a larger number of immigrants than most other european countries ; but the backlash against this policy is firmly rooted in xenophobia , and not in any noble impulse . 
  yeah , the author of the paper i cited offers the interpretation you mention ; earlier data , provided in the lower set of tables on pg . 
  39 , suggests the interpretation i mentioned . 
  ( according to the latter figures , switzerland was only 25 % richer than its peer countries in 1910 , but 83 % richer in 1950 . ), 
  i 'm no economic historian , so i have no idea which interpretation is correct . 
  at any rate , the main point i wished to make was that xenophobia was not responsible for switzerland 's success , and i think * both * sets of data support this conclusion . 
  it was only after switzerland became rich that its immigration policy significantly diverged from that of its neighbors ; and since then , switzerland has been losing economic ground . 
  switzerland was not involved in any wars since the mid-19th century , well before wwi . 
  but in 1851 , it lagged behind many of its neighbors ( see the table on pg . 
  39 of the following [ source ] ( http://www.unige.ch/ses/dsec/repec/files/14091.pdf ) ) . 
  its relative growth mainly occurred between 1910 and 1950 , when the rest of europe was either involved in wars or recovering from them . 
  the rest of europe has been catching up since then . 
  switzerland is successful because its policy of neutrality allowed it to avoid ( and profit from ) the wars plaguing the rest of europe . 
  its xenophobia has nothing to do with its success . 
  they probably want to separate passengers from their laptops so they can secretly rifle through their files ( edit : and/or install surveillance programs ) . 
  unfortunately , the us has plenty of thermonuclear weapons ( e.g. , google and microsoft ) while the eu has one dirty bomb ( sap ) . 
  `` congratulations on your election , mr. macron !, 
  i wish you a long life , strong health , and a resistance to polonium . 
  you 'll need it . '', 
  `` than -- wait , what was that last part ? '', 
  `` err ... i said i hope you resist poland . 
  they might travel through germany to launch a surprise attack on france , you know . '', 
  i do n't speak russian , but i did read the translated version of the article . 
  it asserts that macron is a psychopath and insinuates ( but does not state outright ) that he is gay . 
  an obsession with homosexuality is , of course , to be expected of russian publications . 
  ( a photograph of a shirtless macron is helpfully included for the reader 's examination . ), 
  the author , however , does submit an altogether original idea : that because macron is a ( gay ) psychopath , he can not comprehend any relation with a woman other than a mother-son relation . 
  this , the author claims , explains why he married a much older woman . 
  but is n't it troubling that someone can lose an election on the mere technicality that twice as many people voted for their opponent ? 
  those 1 % are probably politicians -- the lack of corruption in ireland must really be hurting them financially . 
  i do n't know anybody who takes the position that * all * documents obtained through hacking should be disregarded , regardless of their content . 
  if a document were to reveal that macron planned to return france to its napoleonic glory days by invading spain , i would hope that the electorate would take that document into consideration . 
  in this case , however , people are generally ignoring the documents because they are uninteresting and/or fabricated . 
  i think they 'd react the same way if le pen were the subject of the hack . 
  is there a particular document you believe to be worthy of greater consideration ?
