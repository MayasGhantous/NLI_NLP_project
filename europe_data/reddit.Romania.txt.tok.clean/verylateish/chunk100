  exactly my thought !, 
  instead of * knok * * knok * it 's * bum * * bum * ? 
  my grandma is transylvanian saxon . 
  her dialect is more like luxembourgese than saxon tho . 
  huh ?!, 
  yeah right !, 
  edit : . i. 
  i do n't know if it 's true but i thought is funny when i 've read it . 
   of course that 's only what i remember cuz the story was a little longer . 
  it was a joke . 
   i 've read in my childhood that when he was there he convinced rural turks that magyars are kinda turkish themselves by using a few phrases with carefully chosen hungarian words very similar with turkish words . 
  this way he won their trust and they shared their music to him . 
  i guess it 's just a nice legend though . 
  because it is . 
  very tiny . 
  i would n't mind if it would be him and a battalion of turkish soldiers the only ** two ** contestants in that ~ ~ movie ~ ~ reality show . 
  those were like 5 or 6 people ... 
  i 'll be generous and say 20 ... for sure !, 
  thank god i was born 8 years after his death . 
  but i would n't mind a little * reality * * tv * like that in turkey . 
  he did n't end well with all his * eternal * thingy . 
  we hate you back then but we hate austrians and russians way more . 
  up until 1867 . 
  and 1878 for some of us . 
  i guess so ... russia is a big player in this game . 
  ukraine is a small kid here . 
  okay then , 
  they never did and never will !, 
  i look at myself and i really think you 're wrong . 
  i 'm merciful with the weak . 
  and we 're still stronger and alive . 
  you and us !, 
  must be in our blood !, 
  you do n't exactly are indifferent . 
  we just see them like we see any foreigner . . 
  i 'm just amazed they came in our snowy land !, 
  talk about yourself only . 
  not for too * many * * people * . 
  and we have so * many * * people * on earth . 
  good !, 
  you 're forgiven !, 
  not every person is a man . 
  of course . 
  well . . 
  i use soap from farmacy . 
  having a purse help . 
  dowvotes for having a purse ?!, 
  i have many things in it , the little soap is only one thing !, 
  wait until they 'll tell you that `` they do n't have soap at home ... . '' !, 
  we had the russian/soviets , habsburg and ottoman empires !, 
  beat that if you can hahaha :d, 
  neither any romanian principality did ( or transylvania ) . 
  hell , turks were n't even allowed to settle or build mosques here . 
  maybe that 's why we do n't hate them so much ... hmmm, 
  nobody was back then . 
  they were for some of us op . 
  catholic prince from turkey ? 
  in a majority protestant state ? 
  state as in noblemen of course . 
  and then austrians with their re-catholicisation came !, 
  a phanariot guy would 've been a charm for us . 
  oh , russians did n't had any interest in us . 
  they dreamed about constantinople ... not transylvania . 
  i do n't think the phanariotes could 've been a thing for us since we were n't an orthodox principality ( the princes were n't at least ) . 
  russians were n't even able to keep moldova and wallachia , they would n't be exactly able to keep us back then . 
  austria and their re-catholicisation was able though ... unfortunately !, 
  having your family in a paid ( by the state ) position , as an official , is abusse of power and illegal here , punishable with prison . 
  there it is not . 
  not to mention about lobbying which is also illegal here and seen as corruption fwik . 
  eu country not european . 
  bulgaria is n't the most corrupt european country . 
  i hope erdogan will * expire * too until then . 
  you ca n't laugh of your equal . 
  even your writing is pen twister ... :d nice language nonetheless . 
  it means `` i like how your language sound '' in your language ! ^ ^ / s : ^ d, 
  good jesus . . is worse than polish . 
  ( 0 . o ) it has a czech/slovak vibe for my ears . 
  you must be very bright . 
  lol, 
  yeah right !, 
  edit : yeah right !, 
  i stand on my statement !, 
  those things always enrage me . 
  to be completely honest ottomans keep us away from the catholic habsburgs and that was a good thing for my denomination . 
  after austria came everything goes down for us . 
  disclaimer : i 'm talking about transylvania and the protestant church ( reformed ) . 
  edit : thanks for downvotes but that 's how it was !, 
  very good from what i understand . 
  must be bart\u00f3k b\u00e9la 's `` fault '' . 
  have my upvote for the link and the effort . 
  rwkmrmk ?!? 
  i ca n't even think how can that simple word ( ** \u010dmrlj ** ) would be pronounced , imagine if i 'd try to learn how to say something more complex lolol ( 0 . o ), 
  i 'll never put my panties in a bet so pants it is !, 
  and i also put my favourite shoes !, 
  i 'll put a skirt too : ^ p, 
  so that 's number one . 
  i bet my pants he will got more . 
  and i also bet my fav shoes that marie will be praised . 
  i 'm sick of this rape on our conscience !, 
  enough it 's enough !,
