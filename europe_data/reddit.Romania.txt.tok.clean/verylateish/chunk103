  not to mention that i 'm not ethically the same as the majority in this country . 
  i pray this thread wo n't end up genocided by mods . 
  your gov like to bring hate . 
  usually russian people are one of the best friends ever . . as long politics are away from discussions . 
  nah . . same thing as romanians trying to relate with bolohoveni from ukraine . 
  russia is such a big country that i ca n't even think about what common ancient history you could have ? 
  and i talk about the european part of russia only . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love russia !, 
  i just have a grudge with your political life . 
  otherwise russia is what i always dreamed to see !, 
  damn . . 
  i look at your name and your flair ... and then at your answer to / u/atred !, 
  is so polandballish that i laugh my eyes out !, 
  :d disclaimer : i like the answer !, 
  i hate your gov though mr / r/russia mod . 
  bistro is russian though . . and from that time !, 
  kievan rus has rus in it 's name . . so russia in their mind !, 
  simple , as some minds , 
  oh god ... 
  we are those lizzards ( thank god we 're not spider-like or i 'll die looking in the mirror ) but we ca n't really see how we look because we have something implanted in our lizzard brains . . geeee : ^ p, 
  yes !, 
  that 's the movie !, 
  god i hate fat men with moustache . . because of this movie :d thank you !, 
  i 'm not worried . 
  uk was an important asset for eu , no doubt about it , but losing it does n't mean much for us anyways . 
  it means more for them . 
  a continental country 's exit ( france , italy ) would 've been worse . 
  but if so . . we better start federalisation or start thinking about where 's our new master ( for you is france or germany , for me is war or russia ) . 
  the post-truth news and people falling for populism is a big concern though . 
  and those things are the ones who send us in the gutter . . not brexit . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  fortunately it is n't and we know that . 
  in communist times it was a blessing i think . 
   oh and my cable provider has bollywood classic and bollywood tv films . 
  two channels with 24 hours of exclusively indian movies . 
  well , 40 years ago ( or more ) it was an indian movie who was translated like that in romania . 
  my grandparents loved that movie so much that i had to see it at least 4 times lol . 
  and when i 've seen that question i instantly thought about that movie and how that title suits my perception about modern india . . a country formed by a mixture of a very ancient culture ( cultures ) and british influences . 
  a flower and two gardneners . 
   disclaimer : keep in mind that 's just my ** absolutely ** ** uninformed ** opinion/first thought , nothing more . 
  you 're welcome . 
  no thanks . 
  yeah . . 
  i really like those drums . 
  ask your new prez . 
  of course you 're not , your country is tho !, 
  you have no idea how morbid we are . 
  must be a republic in russia . . they usually have * republics * there !, 
  that 'll be no fight !, 
  as long as you keep your promises !, 
  against it ?

  a flower and two gardeners .

  if they 'll see such a horrible statement ... : ^ d, 
  thanks for not nietzsche-ing us !, 
  because its gov. 
  i reported it .

  looks like brexit is presented in india like a nuclear bomb on eu !, 
  i 'll send myself there . 
  so we get married . 
  : ^ ) edit : send your arse here in the snow and i 'll be there in the sun . . !, 
  hate it !, 
  i got enough here and i 'm sick of so much narnia !, 
  upvote it though since it looks cute . 
  tell that to my dad . . and run like hell after !, 
  move a little to the east and you 'll have more narnia than you can handle . 
  no problem .

  i can cut wood , shovelling snow is a joke for me , i can even teach law . . just let me see that damn sun !!!, 
  : '' ( e : ^ / s : ^ d, 
  i 'm not slavic but i 'm eastern european . 
  at least here i never heard something like that . 
  stares in the countryside . . yes , but that 's curiosity . 
  if you 're from northern india you may be mistaken with our most `` not loved '' minority but that 's nothing to be scared about since we are n't violent . 
  in cities yes . 
  i live in the countryside and here only people close to my age may speak english . 
  in the eastern side of the country they are into italian for some reasons . 
  yes , if you take in consideration european federalists . 
  but we are n't many unfortunately . 
  it 's a mixed thing . 
  and also depends of the country . 
  it 's 58 but i cut the laughs from the price . 
  look again at your wallet and kiss it good bye mr. rich westerner !, 
  i 'm good here on the ground . 
  i like the sea ( i tremble a little when i see it first ) and every summer i go to the beach . . only . . but i really do n't feel like i need to swim . 
  * shivers * ^ ^ ^ ^ ewww, 
  i 'm cursed ... !, 
  it 's 30 inside and it 's so cozy to see the blizzard on the window while you 're only in a t-shirt and panties !, 
   and we have p\u00e1linka !!!,
