  to be right it does n't mean it 's also something good . 
  it 's like we two have an argument about a meteorite who 's gon na hit the earth , i say it will and you say it wo n't . . and the meteorite hit the earth . 
  the last thing for me it would be to be glad i was right . 
  these things remained in general western audience mind sice the myth of dracula the vampire exists . 
  well , when you 're right you 're right , 
  i really do n't remember the name . 
  it was that guy and some spanish authority killed his family/kids ... 
  it was awesome , until i sleep unfortunately :(, 
  unfortunately ( in this case ) i 'm right : '' (, 
  i know that . 
  absolutely . 
  it was * ibero * which kinda was out of place there  happy new year by the way !!, 
  romanian . . 
  ibero ... ?!, 
  hmmmm , 
  i 'll put kerosene on his body and put him in fire myself if i could !, 
  those virgins would have only a handful of ash to play with : ^ ), 
  it 's almost like romanian . 
  even when it 's spoken . . for my ears of course !, 
  thanks !, 
   i thought so . 
  i 've seen once a movie in catalan language and i was amazed why it 's subtitled . . until i figure it out that it 's not in romanian lol disclaimer : my native tongue is not romanian . 
  p\u0103i . . cum am reac\u021bionat ?!, 
  but without those tragedies we would n't be alive today , no ? 
  so let 's celebrate them too . . cheers, 
  i know about that too . 
  but it 's normal to have a feud with those who kinda made your national tragedy come true . 
  we 're sorry now !, 
  it 's because those shootings their neighbours had . 
  but they 'll go back to sleep in no time, 
  yup . 
  we 're split in half . 
  the peaceful part is in the east !, 
  you have no idea ^ ^ / s : ^ d, 
  ( 0 . o ) this guy knows things !, 
  i 'm there . . 00:00 the best minute of liv ... :d, 
  only 3 guys ( 2 ?! ), 
  have anything to do with that . 
  most of us are peace loving people ... kinda !, 
  without dragnea 's face ? 
  what language is that in the middle ? 
  is almost like romanian 0 . o, 
  booooooo ... !!!!, 
  not even in ottoman times they were allowed to settle here . 
  so i do n't worry too much . 
  bulgaria though . . 
  i wo n't pretend nothing , i just made fun of your comment . 
  well , then check your wallet while you talk to me . . and your door is n't locked by the way edit : thanks for downvoting me . 
  i hope he 'll die in flames !!!!, 
  downvote all you want , that 's what i hope it will happen to that person and i wo n't change my mind !, 
  happy new year from romania !, 
  not from there . . but they have some , unfortunately :( e : they have . 
  and it 's normal i guess !, 
  those romania vs. turkey quarrels are over since wwi , 
  it 's also because stereotypes and lack of knowledge . 
  fortunately i know a few poles and i changed their minds about this country , 
  as / u/lazo said . 
  other than correcting peoples like you ? 
  of course , i party since we 're in 2017 since one hour hahahaha :d, 
  say what mate omg i met my math teacher ... . 
  wikipedia ? 
  yup ... edit : come here and see us . 
  my house is 700 plus squares meters . 
  made in here not in your sensible west by the way  you 're welcome here my friend !, 
  i never forget , 
  thank you for what you did for me at the colectiv remembrance !, 
  i wo n't forget that !, 
  and thank god you wo n't heard romanians speaking bad about albanians or macedonians or ... god forbade russians . 
  prejudice is what keep us apart and unfortunately make us kill eachother with tens of millions sometimes . 
   people have their idiotic views and some smart ass will jump on them and create a political view . 
  edit : ending my sentence and some words . . 
  be careful since you 'll be downvoted just like me !, 
  say you 're born in 1987 at least ... be careful my southern neighbour , be very careful . . !, 
  i think you 're wrong with at least another 15 years lol at least we are known as gypsies in latin america since longer than that ( * hungaros * ) : ^ ) ( must 've been a romanian conspiracy hmmm ), 
   western europe is not eastern europe 's parents . . for romania it kinda is . . in the general mentality . 
  france and italy help in the 19th . 
  century , language etc etc imo, 
  that 's also the year when your * mafiossi * started to be caught in romania ( timi\u015foara especially ) . 
  i wo n't give sources . . it 's something i 've heard only , 
   it really does n't feel that long . . 
  huh ?!? 
  o.o for me is more than half of my life !, 
  edit : for the downvoters . 
  i 'm sorry i was n't born earlier and without sense of humour . 
  what can i do . . :p, 
  poles hate romanians more than russians in polls too . 
  no need to feel :( about it either . 
  we are the champions anyways , since despite their prejudices and despite our own politicians sometimes we are ** there ** !, 
  a country who was poorest than moldova is richer than all its neighbours beside one and is more democratic than that one too ( i say it as a * one 's * ethnic as you know  ) !, 
  i say we better do n't give one spit on what internet informed ( or infirmed ) people say and work for this country to be better . . like we always did !, 
  fuck them and their preconceived opinions anyways !, 
  ** ** edit ** : thank you good soul , whoever you are !!!!!!, 
  do n't bother . . , 
  too bad you have no idea what you 're talking about . . especially when you talk about romania . . 
  that year i also finally reached 10 years old !, 
  hmmmmmmmmmm : ^ ), 
  naughty holidays , 
  well . . dammit , i think i kinda want them all : ^ d, 
  if only google was invented in eastern europe ... lolol okay school time : it can be abidas or adibas or anything in between .
