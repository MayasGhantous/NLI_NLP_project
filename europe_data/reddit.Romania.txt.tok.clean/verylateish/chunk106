  france would be closer though . . 
  or a golf one . . but in that case everyone would look like trump . 
  spotted the swede . . : ^ p, 
  more stripes means more * abibbas * usually : ^ d, 
  i 'm white enough myself ... especially since this damn winter came :d, 
  i do n't know if it 's a joke or not but i know a guy from mehedin\u021bi county ( close to serbia ) who looks just like that !!!!, 
  ( without the guns and with a smaller beard . . incredible ), 
  i thought so first but then i looked at his flair  `` serbian ... isis . . naaaah '', 
  as always vaslui county is rising an entire region to the next level . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ / s :p, 
  must be a football pitch . . 
  you 'll have a stellar future as a priest :p, 
  i think the portuguese one . . or the turkish one . . hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i 'll edit my post since i 'm not sure . . it 's like a box of cookies : ^ d edit : the spaniard or the swede . . ?!, 
  where 's the irish one ??? 
  ** yes !!, 
  ** victory \u270c, 
  yes . . 
  i see : ^ d, 
  i barely have internet connection where i am . . plus i 'm on the phone and i have no idea how to do it . 
  : / edit : why the downvotes ? 
  i was only honest . 
  eh . . well . 
  well yes !, 
  i forgot about gays . . 
  booooooo !!!, 
  men . . thinking only about themselves like always !!, 
  then you better submit it !, 
  we need a place to talk about boys too !, 
  must be in banat somewhere lol, 
  i 'm not sure if you 're aware but that user is born in rep. of moldova . 
  not even i would try to have an argument with him about what moldovans are , 
  where 's the one with men ??? 
  girls in this sub need a map too . . ya heathens !, 
  the pics must 've been made in march and before artificial tan was a thing . . lol, 
  romanians . . the only pink people on the continent . 
  say what ?!, 
  not even psd likes russia here !, 
  lol, 
  15 % is waaaaaaaay to much !, 
  nobody i ever know like russia , not even my communist grandpa !, 
  maybe it 's about russian geography and people . 
  if so . . 
  i like russia too , 
  that 's because it was a joke about their language . 
  i 'm sorry for them but sometimes stupidity pays off . 
  it 's a moldavian - romanian dictionary from what i remember made up by a guy . 
  stati i think it was his name . 
  other romanian/moldovan user should be more into these things tho . 
  even more ... if you know what i mean . 
  / r/anormaldayinadysfunctionalfamily ... . say hello toooo eastern europe guys ... !!!!, 
  i guess it 's only that they make fouls of themselves when they do that . 
  as a romanian speaker ( more or less ) i feel bad for people like them since it only make people laugh . 
  not to mention that some of them are n't exactly glad about that . . / u/gaudeamuss knows more . .  but since they feel like that . . go for it guys !, 
  even if it 's not my mother tongue i speak romanian with a s\u0103tm\u0103rean / moro\u015fan / o\u015fan accent . 
  and regardless , those from bucharest would say it 's still romanian ( because it is ) not something else even if i could sound even more weird than you for their fancy ears : ^ d, 
  western moldova with all medieval capitals of the principality and the river from which it took its name are in present day romania . 
  rep. of moldova is arguably 1/3 of the real moldova . 
  eastern romanians are moldovans in fact and they made romania since their prince was the one who was elected as a ruler by those in the south ( bucharest ) , not the other way , when the united principalities were formed . 
  edit : united principalities is the first name romania had . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , danubian principalities was a thing too . 
  omg ... what did you just say !!!!, 
  i hope portuguese users are too busy and not interested in this topic , or else you 're as good as dead : ^ d, 
  it 's not even a dialect , is a * speech * !, 
  it has an accent only and some regionalisms . 
  just like every romanian speech ( grai/graiuri in romanian ) . 
  where i live romanians speak even more different than the official language but they do n't call what they speak something different . 
  god no . . 
  i mean if that news was on t.v. !, 
  of course the vid it 's not for television i guess . 
  no telly ?!, 
  smart choice !, 
  only now ... ? 
  i would n't try to be anything in turkey 's gov right now if i 'll be her/him !, 
  i hold some hope for you guys but it kinda fainted these years unfortunately . 
  big surprise . . ?!, 
  i wonder why erdi does n't shut down internet completely ? 
  edit : does television stations said that in turkey ? 
  ( the burning i mean ), 
  i just hope petre roman gon na dye his hair in jail . 
  the old one will die long before this trial will be over . 
  he will end up in our future history books as a criminal in the end !, 
  that 's he 's punishment anyway . . ion iliescu the ** the ** ** criminal !!!, 
  ** hahahahahahaha our laughs and piss on his grave are n't enough for what he did !,
