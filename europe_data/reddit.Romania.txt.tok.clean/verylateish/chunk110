  i know , 
  wanting or not i 'm part of the greater `` eastern european culture '' in your eyes and i will be/was associated with russians , czechs , albanians . . even greeks and lithuanians , so moldova is nothing for me since i live in a country very close to that country ; linguistically wise at least . 
  we must challenge this . . it 's a sickness !, 
  jesus . . a chinese !, 
  how those small island are by the way ? 
  edit : 1 word, 
  yeah . . that 's from moldova .

  trolling has it 's limits mate . 
  we all know they will but this is a poor taste trolling . 
  edit : thanks for your downvotes . . from someone like you it 's a badge of honour !,

  it 's a little far from mommy 's attick/basemen ... where these people live !, 
  it said that '' * ` ungary * should take their ancestral lands back and push the brown romanians aback to the black sea '' . 
  it was embarrassing for me as a human being and as a hungarian living in romania .
