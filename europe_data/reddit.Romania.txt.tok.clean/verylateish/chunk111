  from all our banknotes * you * choose the least valuable one . 
  you 're a shame for all luxembourgers .

  e : * i * * know * * you * * did n't * * make * * the * * map * * do n't * * worry * . 
  and a lot of slapfights too hahahaha, 
  http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-make-sweet-and-salty-popcorn/ but i guess the right answer would be ** sweet ** if i look at your flair . 
  this one is definitely one of those in the heavy category of pain since many wo n't be happy being in one or another `` category '' ( region ) . 
  i already prepared my popcorn , 
  this thread has great potential to become a big pain in the butt for mods . 
  i disagree . 
  let her rot in a jail in europe . 
  no and no . 
  my necee and that girl are still children under eu law . 
  unfortunately that 's the least i can do . 
  i 'd treat them how we do it here ... but unfortunately we have mods . 
  oh ... so i 'm abussed by them now lololol be serious please . 
  i may be young but i lived outside enough to know what an abuser is . 
  i 'm okay with that as long as one person changed it 's mind from `` let 's kill her '' to `` hmmm ... maybe she should only stay in prison '' . 
  i only think it 's routine for someone like her to be raped there .
