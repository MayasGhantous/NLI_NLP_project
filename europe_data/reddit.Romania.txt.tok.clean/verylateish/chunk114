  no no ... 
  i 'm not sure which is which in the written form . 
  :d \u0102 = ? 
  but to be honest both the start of that word oand last sounds like a mixture between both letters to me . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ damn try . 
  maybe you need a cold bath before you sleep . 
  on these heat ... 
  that 's a hard one . 
  i 'm not even sure if i wrote that correctly since it 's how i perceived aromanian ( southern balkans `` romanian '' ) . 
  \u042a\u041c\u0428\u042f\u0422\u042a kinda but i 'm not sure which is '' \u00c2 '' and which is '' \u0102 '' in bulgarian alphabet . 
  no , i 'll be very careful with it dear . 
  very very ^ very ... careful, 
  ask your dad if `` frumos '' or `` mf\u015fat '' ring bell . 
   there 's some of those in hungarian too , cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 dialect comes to mind . 
  oh honey but you 'll be tired tomorrow it 's better to sleep now and tomorrow evening i 'll be ready for you come , here is the bed ... and think about me . 
  okay nite nite . 
  transylvanian romanian is same thing ( almost ) as moldovan , oltenian , muntenian etc romanian . 
  there 's no difference except some local words which are kinda obsolete by now . 
  there is an accent though but everyone in constan\u021ba will understand somebody from where i live ( satu-mare ) without problems . 
  weeeell ... that guy is from transnistria while a.i. 
  cuza was from gala\u021bi . 
  big difference . 
  oh ... just trying to cut a rebel thread on my dress go to sleep dear * you 'll * * wake * * up * * early * * in * * the * * morning *, 
   for a reason that i forgot treason . 
  oh yeah ... very lovable indeed \u2702 \u2702 \u2702, 
  no no no ... aromanian is imo a different language than romanian . 
  i barely understand half of it . 
  it 's more like bulgarian and slovenian than bulgarian and macedonian . 
  in my opinion of course . 
  really ??? 
  so you 're not only romanian but best romanian aka moldovan too ? 
  you just made me * `` love '' * men even more !, 
  extraordinary !, 
  i 'm hungarian but one of my grandmother is transylvanian saxon . 
  so i 'm kinda like you hahaha :d . 
  so he understand romanian . 
  i asked if he understand romanian or aromanian because for me aromanian is quite different from romanian . 
  oh common !, 
  he did it for prestige ... like all men !, 
  a woman would 've been way better . 
  i have turkish friends irl and except the * hunger * written on their face in the ramadan days the only difference is that they smoke cannabis and i do n't even know how that thing smells like hahahaha :d, 
  oh so your dad 's family was a vlach one ? 
  i knew there are a handful of romanian people in bulgaria but i never thought i 'll stumble in one lol does your dad understand romanian or aromanian ? 
  i 'm very curious !, 
  i live in northern transylvania but we also have a house in wallachia ( northern muntenia ) and close to that house there 's a village where most people talk in bulgarian between eachother even today . 
  do n't remember about that battle !, 
  like always dem germans and their damn reichs !, 
  i 'm not a big fan of him . 
  too much attention to the west and way too less to where the `` doom '' came from . 
  really ?!, 
  wow !, 
  so , they have vlach ( romanian ) roots or they just learn the language ? 
  i know there 's many vlach families in serbia on the timok valet . 
  are they related to those ? 
  i love these stuffs by the way . 
  beehehehehe daniel 's lyrics are spot on !, 
  and that 's how we ended up under communism !, 
  without steve maybe we could 've moved to france or something in the end ... or at least italy . 
  f. . k the pope !!!, 
  in fact lot 's of villages from there were re-made or straight up founded with people from bulgaria since at least 15 century . 
  they are romanians now of course but many of their ancestors came ( were taken ) from bulgaria . 
  wallachia was kinda a safe heaven for many revolutionaries from all over the balkans . 
  we 'll take good care of it : ^ p ^ ^ i ^ ^ knew ^ ^ he 'll ^ ^ surrender ^ ^ when ^ ^ big ^ ^ guns ^ ^ come . 
  yes !, 
  they 're the ones . 
  even if from what i know those in wallachia converted back to orthodoxy or mixed with other catholic people since i only know about bulgarian orthodoxes there and ( to be back on the topic of this thread ) they are called serbians . 
  we 'll take everything !, 
  or else you 'll have only british tourists there . 
  you choose, 
  you 're right here . 
  you only need to pump money and power in church 's arse . 
  soon gigi becali and daniel will be saints in romania ... 
  i think gigi will be in greece too lol, 
  not only . 
  there 's lot 's of romanians in moldova ( the region in romania ) which are roman catholic . 
  especially in bac\u0103u , neam\u021b and ia\u015fi . 
  also not to forget about uniates in transylvania . 
  oh and we even have bulgarian roman catholics in banat ( if i remember exactly ) / u/malon1, 
  yes in dobruja . 
  well , from what i see the trend is that every summer all bulgaria 's sea shore will be rightful romanian soil soon hahahaha so be afraid , be very afraid !!!, 
  i get that but since poland and romania do n't even share a border ( or the same linguistic family , christian denomination etc ) these similarities are incredible . 
  for me at least . 
  f. . . steve !, 
  the only good thing he did was to consolidate a state . 
  saint my arse, 
  yes . 
  we even have something like 80.000 or so muslims hahahaha, 
  to be honest i believe that even vlad would 've be a saint now if he was * kinder * with the church . 
  but you 're right . 
  that damn stephen bringing catholicism to us is an unforgivable offense for a protestant like me . 
  / u/istencsaszar knows * kinder *, 
  so only a knyaz !, 
  such a pleb ^ ^ / s : ^ d yeah just like saint stephen for hungarians and saint stephen the great and holly for romanians . 
  both were everything else but saints . 
  oh ... so that 's the first czar ? 
  or he got another title after he became christian ? 
  i 've heard about simeon , we even had a lesson about him in junior high . 
  hmmmm ... blinding his son , ceding his concubine ... sounds like a great guy . 
   ( do n't worry , it 's just a joke ), 
  got it from / u/malon1 .
