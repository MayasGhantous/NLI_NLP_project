  thank you . 
  yes but i thought , since it 's a bulgarian movie that they 'll show something more ... bulgaria stronk-like . 
   not to mention that - as a woman - i 'm quite mad at that khan now !, 
  yep i get it now , 
  oh ... so the guys with furs on their helmets are serbian . 
  i thought they 're bulgarian since it was a bulgarian movie and the older guy looks like he talks from a position of power ... you know what i mean . 
  hmmm til thanks !, 
  incredible how similar they are to our politicians . 
  i even see some comments here about a territorial defence force and if i remember correctly , there was a discussion some time ago in romania about something similar . 
  some sort of armed force under parliamentary control . 
  i start thinking that both romanian and polish politicians have the same master or they meet periodically and discuss what to do next , because from what i see they copy every move from eachother lol . 
  and i talk about our entire political class not only pis and psd . 
  okay it 's a joke but sometimes it makes you think . 
  so ... what they 're talking about there ? 
  : i 'd like to have boris ' tent , it 's cute . 
  to be honest since is almost 40 degrees here i 'll only need those boxers and a bra right now . 
  i do n't mind but fortunately ( or unfortunately ) i 'm a female . 
  lol hahaha xd, 
  oh i know that . 
  lucky bastards !, 
  i hope so but i have big doubts . 
  i know ... kinda . 
  but here men are extremely ashamed to be compared to ... `` gays ' . 
  aahaha, 
  huh ?!, 
  thanks for renewing bulgarian alphabet !, 
  those who love it need that . 
  asking anything ( from human/gay rights to a cigarette ) is a horrible thing in our country sometimes . 
   from personal experience sorry !, 
  shhhhh !, 
  shut your mouth !, 
  they were here since forever . 
  without communism of course . 
  you 're gay ?!?!, 
  i need some tips about my clothes . 
  help please !, 
  good !, 
  was n't he arrested ? 
   ... the guy who picked up the remains of ottoman empire and created ** turkey ** ftfy e : to see an arabised guy destroying something which was almost holly for a country we used to consider friendly is quite disturbing . 
  and those who think that are at least na\u00efve if not plain stupid . 
  not even us who are in eu know what eu money did for us and they expect that from a brainwashed population ?!, 
  i 'm not exactly ... offended ( cuz reasons ) . 
  forcing people to learn their language in a foreign/useless alphabet is ... and i say it with indulgence ... fascist ( not to say a form of ethic and cultural cleaning ) . 
  and they pose as communists lol, 
  i think all this help is pointless and stupid . 
  my opinion of course . 
  not much . 
  except some heavy storms . 
  oh ... and a fat arse clown from russia ( who 's on eu travel ban list ) tried to pass thorough our air space even if he was n't allowed in 2014 either . 
  he was sent back home again . 
  obviously he think that a huge arse as him should be above the law in another countries too ... just like in russia . 
  wow thanks for that !, 
  it 's long but at least i 'll learn some more things about that place . 
  what baffles me though is how in the hell some people there can access eu funds ?!? 
  i 've seen it on tv . 
  some sort of factory made with eu funds . 
  hill tribes , plains tribes , mountain tribes ... they 're all uncivilized and in great need of russian culture and * democracy * . 
  those barbarians do n't know it yet but thankfully russia will bring the light to them ... with tanks if necessary . 
  hail tovarisch putin !, 
  exactly . 
  and to be honest it 's quite a smart move ( from an oppressor point of view ) since learning romanian in cyrillic is useless so parents will choose to send their children to a school where they at least learn something useful aka russian language in its proper version not some bastardized romanian filled with archaic terms and in an alphabet nobody use for it . 
  haaaahaha touch\u00e9, 
  but i 'll be gentle . 
  mommy knows best, 
  now you 're naughty . 
  i 'm sure a good spanking will teach you to behave, 
  same as in transnistria . 
  from what i know the few ( ? ), 
  schools who teach in romanian do it in cyrillic alphabet . 
  i mean ... 
  i wish i would know how to make you `` comme to mommy '', 
  i wish i 'd knew how . 
  not at all . 
  neither am i. 
  and i still rather have luka instead putin . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  come come ... to mommy sssssss, 
  when was the last time when a person died officially ? 
  and they did n't put it in practice . 
  neither did russia ... officially . 
   yeah ... well . 
  i rather took luka instead of putin any day . 
  i mean that if dictatorship in russia would be more like in belarus ... 
  do n't be too confident . 
  that 's all it matters for us anyway ssssssssssssssss, 
  be scared ... be very scared !, 
  e : oh no ... be intrigued be intrigued ** damn **, 
  those were little boys ( okay in the orthdox priests cases here they were closer to your age ) not men !, 
  i would n't mind to oppress you a little though, 
  yea ... 
  same things here . 
  i even know a guy who put pvc windows to a 17 century water mill . 
  hail modernization lolol, 
  to be honest since i 'm not a boy i was n't exactly oppressed by catholicism or ( and from what i see on t.v. ), 
  orthodoxy . 
  sticking this would be great mods !, 
  so ... not exactly great news at all . 
  ** this ** one hundred times this !, 
  edit : downvote me all you want but unfortunately we kinda know how those power hungry politicians work . 
  too bad for us : '' (,
