  they successfully made their grindeanu to back off . 
  i wonder if duda will do the same as grindeanu . 
  he can do it especially since he ca n't be removed by poland 's dragnea . 
  surprising move . 
  i 'm entitled to do that since i was oppressed by your kin !, 
  black pow ... oh wait, 
  it is ? 
  i 'm not very knowledgeable about navalniy 's politics . 
  anyways ... you 're right . 
  even if a progressive party/leader would ( by some miracle ) be in charge of russia , they would n't be able to change much . 
  people 's mentality is too ingrained in the past and nationalism is way to present in their minds ( we are a superpower/empire etc ) that it will take a century to really change something . 
  not to mention that they 're just way too huge . 
  if a small country like my own did n't recovered from * the * * past * , imagine how long it will take for russia ( the russias ) to recover . 
  a spike in your papist arse . 
  that 's what it has . ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry !, 
  thank you, 
  i was thinking about crimea mostly . 
  and you 're right . 
  to be honest if russia would be more like belarus i would n't mind if they 'll annex transnistria . 
  unfortunately gorbachev/yeltsin era is long gone from russia 's mentality . 
  now the `` we stronk '' thinking prevails . 
  not if transylvania will do it first, 
  he 's catholic . 
   migrant crisis now hitting r/europe you 're late to the party . 
  i do n't think so . 
  it really represented us more . 
  imo of course . 
  e : f. . k you too then !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ said ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ putin, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ thank ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you !, 
  4/4 like russian money . 
  not that guy but ... their ideology move around communism , russia-nism and orthodoxy . 
  it 's very close with two branches of our own nationalism . 
  that 's how you call them ? 
  they wo n't get tired as long as eu money pour there in the same time with russian propaganda . 
  russia can absorb anything by the way . 
  you should know that better than me . 
  for me anything from before 1999 is ancient history, 
  we 're talking about 2017 europe not 1950s . 
  are you really comparing france and u.k. overseas territories with what russia does today ?!, 
  ca n't argue that . 
  and the parliament will vote them . 
  my friend , i really really like poland but my country usually follows your lead ( with a few years delay ) and that 's exactly what we do n't need as an example now !, 
  absolutely but those democracies did n't annexed territories from that country . 
  ( let 's not go into `` but they kill negroes '' argument ) of course . 
  it does n't mean it 's right or that i have to agree with it . 
  now honestly . 
  do you like how russian people live today ? 
  beaten when they have a different opinion . 
  killed by islamist because they `` do n't exist '' in sharia law enclaves . 
  robbed by a handful of kissarse thugs ... etc etc etc, 
  really ?!, 
  comparing ancient `` democracy '' with what we have is like comparing roman republic with french republic . 
  obviously some countries from * russia 's * * sphere * * of * * influence * have a prefference for something else . 
  not to mention that most of what ~ ~ athens ~ ~ moscow think is it 's sphere of influence is more democratic than the metropolis . 
  comparing germany 's money with moldova 's one it 's a huuuuge stretch . 
  and the same is comparing yeltsin russia with putin 's russia . 
  i do n't know about poland but here a judge ca n't be `` removed '' . 
  it 's one of the things that make a person to be free to judge other people 's actions . 
  if you 're afraid that you 'll lose your job you ca n't do that . 
  having all the power in your hands it 's the end of democracy . 
  imo e : no offence meant for our polish friends . 
  out of the window with factual news !, 
  here comes mr sensational !, 
  ** breaking ** ** news ** a chicken made two eggs in two minutes !!!!!!, 
  lol, 
  i 'm not sarcastic . 
  piecekeepers ... well that 's sarcastic . 
  i know they are n't communists but they are a dictatorship . 
  dictatorship of mafia is still dictatorship . 
  especially for those who try to speak/learn romanian it 's quite visible and not a nice thing . 
  what i find idiotic is that eu founds go there . 
  eu founds for moldova go there too . 
  incredible !, 
  well ... 
  i asked for russia not for the ** defunct ** ussr . 
  `` war of words '' is sensationalist for you ?!, 
  jesus guys , this guy/girl really need a big dose of british or romanian press to recover his/her senses . 
  are you bald , big and hairy ? 
  some bombs you must have since you 're a terrorist . 
  i think it 's with the help of chi\u015fin\u0103u airport which is in moldova . 
  that 's how they get everything from russia nowadays . 
  yeah about that . 
  those are socialists as much as our socdems are social democrats and me a nazi white supremacist . 
  * peacekeepers *, 
  plot twist  a fine young slovakian ~ ~ woman ~ ~ man best ftfy, 
  those are everywhere . 
  really !, 
  i think they can walk from bratislava to vienna . 
  that 's the joke hehehe, 
  bald guy on a hairy bear . 
  many dictatorships fancy themselves as republic and democratic . 
  it 's an old communist practice . 
  i declare independence !, 
  hmmm ... nope , nothing changed !, 
  i guess i have to look for a big bad and hairy guy to support my statement without really look like he does that . 
  i live in the green area of romania and my parents own a house in the red zone . 
  at the last biggish earthquake we were ( of course ) in the second house . 
  my mum and i woke up the entire village with our screams and my dad did n't even bothered to stop snoring . 
  damn this is a ** dark ** comment .
