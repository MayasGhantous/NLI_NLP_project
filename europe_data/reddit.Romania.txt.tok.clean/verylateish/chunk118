  but they 're quite similar to yours . 
  for political opinions and personal stuff pm please . 
  oh ... you do n't have to tell me everything about her . 
  now i really want to kill this guy !, 
  i thought it 's true you mother ... . . !!!!!!, 
  how dare you !, 
  no tinfoil hats/fedora wearers allowed !, 
  trans ?!, 
  i never knew a trans . 
  she was woman ... or it is woman now ... 
  hmmm ... mutual friend ?!, 
  she 's from england ? 
  i do n't mind !, 
  if it 's okay for you it 's okay for me . . my friend !, 
  op you 're right !, 
  it will be a mistake . 
  from what i know , add-in someone as your friend here would fill your inbox with everything they write . 
  am i right ? 
  dunno much ( or anything ) about your personality , hell i do n't even know your gender , but what you said here in this thread it 's very close to what i think . 
  incredible !, 
  i rather think that nordics ( and all of us ) should * into * estonia . 
  especially into their epolitics . 
  me too !, 
  jesus christ ... wtf i really found my polish self ?!, 
  i ca n't understand anything in estonian or finnish unfortunately . 
  we 're kinda the basques of eastern europe hahaha, 
  imagine how it is to be a non indo-european in here hehehe , 
  well , it 's a different situation for romanians . 
  you have slavic countries/people/languages around you while romanians do n't have anything remotely related to a romance language around them but aromanian and ( now dead and buried ) dalmatian . 
  just like you know what slavic language is the most similar with polish . 
   but other romanian speakers may have different opinions , that 's why i said * imo * . 
  it does hehehe . 
  aromanian is almost romanian . 
  even i can understand some of it . 
  i 'd say italian ( dunno what dialect specifically ) is second and catalan third . 
  of course that 's only my opinion . 
  oh , i thought it 's some sort of online game lolol . 
  for a romanian speaker ( imo ) the closest is aromanian and the furthest is portuguese , with italian , catalan , french in between . 
  rumantsch is black magic for me . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i 'm not sure what 's wos . 
  i 'm into civil code more than in the penal one . 
  and that 's how portuguese is for a romanian speaker . 
  your guessing skills are good . 
   i never learned spanish in school . 
  i guess understanding spanish/italian is for me like it will be for you to understand serbian/bulgarian . 
  law , history and geography are my things too . 
  i kinda was forced to learn two languages since i 'm a minority in romania . 
  so i know my mother tongue and of course romanian . 
  the other two are french ( i lived five years in a francophone african country when i was a little girl ) and italian ( thanks to my romanian ) . 
  i can understand written spanish , more or less and i kinda get some portuguese too . 
  i hate physics and math . 
  we as in ... 
  i know about the short ( ? ), 
  ** i ** and ** e ** . 
  it always is . 
  and even more when it 's about russia . 
  e : and now i realized why some things are downvoted . 
  to be hidden !, 
  lol, 
  looks like i 've found my soulmate !, 
  \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 i know three languages and i understand quite well another two-four . 
  but i barely can write in my native one correctly hahaha :d, 
  out where ? ^ ^ / s :p, 
  look , they even have two different tipes of ** i ** !, 
  i 'm a wiki student too ( sometimes ) but i never go into linguistics . 
  that 's worse than chemistry for me and i really suck at chemistry ... no , really , ** i 'm ** ** very ** ** bad ** at chemistry lolol kudos to you !, 
  you must be a languages student or professor . 
  i\u0151t ? 
  * iemen * gion * jak now i kinda understand why cyrillic alphabet it 's used by so many countries . 
  i understood that . 
  and i would n't mind to see a normal russia but since that 's not possible i 'm pleased with the one we have now as long as it does n't go full retard . 
  really ?!, 
  so that 's how you write * rz * . 
  i wonder what your and polish linguists had against the poor leter ** j ** ? 
  and that 's how you start a new trend in / r/europe . 
  kill the mods ! ^ ^ / s :d, 
  hahaha i had to google that . 
  good one !, 
  [ yellow ] - mordor :p, 
  c'mon , it 's a piece of art in front of cwrwwrwrwrw . ^ ^ / s : ^ ), 
  op is polish from what i know . 
  oh f. . k , you talked about the welsh redditor . 
  their history of `` changing '' is n't exactly great . 
  so i rather have them like they are now than see them transforming in something else . 
  i barely put him to sleep . 
  there there li 'll knighty monk there there !, 
  how about we burn some heathens now ? 
  yeah ?
