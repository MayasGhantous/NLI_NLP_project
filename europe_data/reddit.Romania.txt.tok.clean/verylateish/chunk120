  i mean , where the hell is our sense of humour guys ?!, 
  well , he definitely was n't a dictator . 
  but after ceau\u015fescu we kinda have a `` nose '' for those who want to be one . 
  the one who want that now is dragnea ( no * escu * unfortunately ) . 
  hmmm ... iliescu has n't done that though . 
  he even lost prez elections in 96 or 97 ( i was n't born back then so i 'm not very sure when it was lol ) . 
  looks like * luca\u015fescu * is worse than iliescu . 
  iliescu is the one most similar with lukashenko/a . 
  not a militarist like antonescu and not exactly like ceau\u015fescu but far from a normal democratic leader . 
  at least until ' 97 . 
  in his last prez mandate he was n't like that anymore ( at least that 's what i 've heard ) . 
  what a big can of worms i 've opened , did n't i ? 
  the one i hate the most is ion iliescu . 
  well that 's rude !, 
  : ^ ) edit1 : wow there 's a flood of downvotes on this thread lolol looks like i touch in a very inappropriate way something holly for some people . 
  shame on me !, 
  edit2 : i did n't talk about you / u/putin-the-fabulous of course . 
  hmmm til . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll call him alexandru luca\u015fescu from now on . 
  so ... both are correct in latin script ? 
  nice !, 
  you can even use that little thingy in the right as a christmas tree . 
  portugal is belarus in disguise confirmed !, 
  that 's why you sound kinda slavic . 
  i always thought their * dear * * leader * 's name was lukasenko but half of reddit call him lukasenka . 
  what 's his real name for god sake ? 
  this is what my friends from that area told me . 
  looks like it was built by iron guard members back in the 40 's and the inscription on it say that * they * 'll came back stronger . 
  e1 : * they * as in who built the cross i assumed . 
  e2 : google `` crucea legionarilor moreni '' looks like it was built in 1936 . 
  kinda ( very ) shitty resolution though . 
  i made it with an old phone and my photographic skills are close to non-existent . 
  please be gentle . 
  i doubt you can drive even a moped on it . 
  but i may be wrong . 
   sex orgies  krupp was asked to leave italy i would n't expected for such an attitude from the country who gave us berlusconi !,

   death cult religion it 's still present and prosperous . 
  we had too much trajans . 
  the last one was president for ten years .

  it was danube who moved romulus and remus to italy .

  dijayball in da house peopleeeeee !,

  to be honest , any huge construction is financed by morally questionable persons , be them ancient or modern . 
  both heroes and scum for two different nations .

  both my countries always looked up on the west . 
  one less than the other but still . 
  i really enjoy it !, 
  you have an incredible country ... and some gorgeous boys too , 
  i 'm cool with this since wisdom and superiority came with it . 
   e : not in our piece of dixie europe ... but i wo n't talk about that . 
  i was there . 
  i had so many preconceptions about it ( kinda like an american , western european or pole before visiting romania ) but a guy here on reddit kinda cool it down my fears and jesus i 've seen one of the most gorgeous country ever with my own eyes . 
  paying a bribe ( my brother , since i have no money ) to an albanian cop , for not having a motorcycle licence , was great too ... 
  i 'm quite claustrophobic and jail is n't exactly my favourite place . 
  all in all it is a great country !, 
  my opinion , of course . 
  edit ^ ^ like ^ ^ always : and our guide in the northernmost mountains was an ** absolutely ** ** gorgeous ** guy !, 
  oh god ...
