  at least you acknowledge my age superiority and wisdom ... even if i 'd gladly scratch your face for that * `` granny * '' !, 
  :d suck it and shut up !!!!, 
  or i 'll send yer uncle with his toy !!!, 
  here , have a toy and let the grownups talk . ^ / s :d, 
  yes but using english internet could change your mind not only about your actual system of gov but about many things like : lgbt rights , human rights , your right to a lawyer . . etc  kinda like it was for us here . 
  well ... 
  i think that 's quite unfortunate . 
  having www on your disposal and do n't use it ? 
  not to mention that for some `` situations '' you got only one part of the story . 
  that 's another chapter of `` dictators little handbook '' unfortunately , making people lazy ... even in their minds . 
  it 's quite normal since you have a giant , like the russian internet , on your disposal . 
  and your economy/system does n't really push youngsters to learn english or any western language since it 's of no use . 
   how stupid politicians were have * cough * * cough * go to the back of the line , we were here first !, 
  i rather think they 're more present on russian language boards . 
  / u/azgarr am i right ? 
  unfortunately i do n't have too much exposure to chinese humour . 
  true . 
  hey hey hey !!!, 
  watch your mouth little boy !, 
  how dare you to call me old ? 
  i 'm only older than your prepubescent arse !, 
  hey , i 'm inviting little cats not little kids ... even if you are a kid for me of course . 
  in your ... emmm ... food of course !, 
  come come, 
  you ca n't please these spoiled brats . 
  i 'll use laaaaard ... come kitty kitty kitty ... look , i have lard ... 
  oh man , i found the ~ ~ german ~ ~ chinese . 
  i guess my sense of humour is not exactly ... like in china ? 
  it was a joke . 
  okay ... ya spoiled little catholic !, 
  i 'll use a wooden one instead . 
  deal ? 
  i changed my mind . 
  the spike is hot ... now !, 
  i use welder gloves . 
  is your * `` person '' * ready ? 
  i 've spilled coffee on my phone laughing !, 
  `` it might have been unpleasant '' haaaahahaha :d . 
  i rather be careful than sorry . 
  at least i did n't put that iron spike in fire . 
  edit for those with a * german * sense of humour : ** it ** ** is ** ** a ** ** joke !, 
  some of those most ancient thingies look like sz\u00e9kely runes . 
  e : `` thingies '' because i have no idea what is the english word for them . 
  nah ... if i 'd had a dirty mind i would 've said `` it looks like a damn catholic arse in need for an iron spike '' . 
  it kinda look like an arse ... ( 0 . o ), 
  i 'm a stupid n\u00fc ren then hahaha e : because i did n't understood what you said . 
  i 'm a what ?!, 
  well ... at least i 'm aware now that we crossed our legs even in ancient china . 
   e : okay now , it was a joke for f. . . sake !, 
  ooookay ... ( o.o ) . 
  say again ?!?!, 
  edit : damn , i must admit that i 'm a stupid n\u00fc ren . 
  they 're the bo s ( s ) ... : ^ ), 
  what a. . . ?!, 
  ( 0 . o ) i 'll be scared to ask for a map with how they call the people living in those countries . 
  seriously now . 
  how does a hungarian woman would be called in mandarin ? 
  edit : my country 's name is so stereotypically chinese . 
  south park would be proud . 
  he does n't have the best czech words . 
  in czechia and slovenia . 
  to visit his in-laws . 
  yeah right hahahaha, 
  neither am i a city . 
   do n't worry i live in a small village too . 
  czech republic president material right here . 
  til any drunkard look like a crook for danes . 
  in romania even villages have coa . 
  i guess it 's for ... tradition sake ? 
  i understand it 's not exactly its flag/coa but more of a logo . 
  what ?!, 
  ankara has a huge history ( look up for ancyra ) . 
  not to even start about the other places in anatolia or the european part of turkey . 
  you have lot 's of history there , more than most of us . 
  our president would be quite a unifier . 
  when you have an idiot in power trying hard to be an islamic putin you got that . 
  it would be laughable if it would n't be sad . 
  for turkey and all of us . 
  that made in the u.s.a. spoils the pic big time ! ^ / s : ^ d, 
  wow it looks like something coming from an engine !, 
  you 're right . 
  but this pic still give me a cozy home-like feeling . 
  have three of those a fountain in each of them and food for one year . 
  those guy who want to get them will loose some time before get them all and in the mean time your real army is there . 
  surprise !, 
  weirdest castle i ever seen ( in pics ) . 
  i guess it was even weirder for the one who tried to get it . 
  nice !, 
  those hills look so much as the hills surrounding my village . 
  incredible but i feel like home when i look at this picture ... bar the mountain unfortunately . 
  i have no idea what 's that . 
  everything !, 
  i 'm very curious about those things . 
  i guess it 's like lesbianism is for guys . 
  interesting . 
  tell me more !, 
  at least you 're gay ? 
  or is only some strange fetish ? 
  please teach me about men , oh you great lord of darkest sexuality !, 
  exactly !,
