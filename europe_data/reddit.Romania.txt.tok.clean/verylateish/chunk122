  only pl and hu , or more exactly pis and orb\u00e1n . 
  so that 's why you gave up to south stream , so they 'll make two nord streams ? 
  embrace your easterness , be cool with it and make peace with yourself . 
  i figure it out , 
  from what i know a ladyboy has a penis . 
  what you described there is you transforming in a woman . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  men are strange . 
  speak what against them ? 
  we 're seven different countries with different interests . 
  not to mention that v4 did n't said anything against us or our own eu politics ( which to be honest are nonexistent here ) and we see them as four different countries pl , cz , sk , hu not like a group . 
  you like your beard , wan na look like that guy but you also wish to be a ladyboy ?!, 
  ( 0 . o ) i have to say that now i 'm very confused . 
  e : men and their fetishes . 
  i never said i want to * remove * you . 
   e : you wish to become one ?!, 
  and what 's stopping you ? 
  and here we are going backwards . 
  ouch !, 
  looks like that . 
  lol edit : hungary speaking for romania . 
  well ... 
  i know . 
  i kinda am able to read a text in cyrillic ( like a first grader lol ) . 
  i just found trump/tramp amusing . 
  hey , this could even catch up . 
  trump the tramp . 
   russia , however , is suspiciously intact coincidence ? 
  i think not . ^ / s, 
  take some lessons from us , son . 
  our navy sheep commandos sank a russian military ship . 
  remove pagan ladyboys . 
  booooooo !!!, 
  trump is literally a ** tramp ** in russian ( ucrainian ? ) . 
  that was a `` sad '' day for my self-esteem . 
  i literally panicked thinking that someone hacked my laptop or my account . 
  i 'll never forgive / r/europe mods for that !, 
  yes !!!, 
  me too !, 
  lol, 
  indeed and it 's annoying as hell . 
  well , i must admit i like this p. . a very much . 
  eastern europe is n't only v4 . 
  ^ this !, 
  indeed , 28 years ago they had half of europe . 
  everyone does that unfortunately . 
  except turkey . 
  russia shrinking ?!, 
  from what i 've seen they 're growing . . abkhazia , ossetia , transnistria , donbass , crimea ... 
  gib sebi ghi\u021b\u0103 or you 'll stay there forever !, 
  edit : / s, 
  holland ?!, 
  ( o.o ) kill the heretic !, 
  is n't a wall there ?!, 
  anyway , sweden is horrible !, 
  trust me !, 
  mudslim all over there ... ^ / s : ^ d, 
  a pole broke my bike . 
  crime rates ? 
  it looks so tropical for someone who does n't know better . 
  it 's a good propaganda poster for south-eastern asian workers . 
  `` come to usssssssss '' : ^ d e : aaaand i 'm downvoted . 
  i should 've learn from that estonian guy on r/askeurope that your sense of humour is n't exactly there ... :(, 
  the worse country , according to t_d i guess :d, 
  thanks !, 
  hahahaha e1 : russia , castrating ~ ~ scandinavia ~ ~ sweden since 17th century ( or was it 18th ... ?! ) . 
  i think you can expand this to most of we . 
  sweden and finland ... jesus christ guys , you look like * cough * * cough * something . 
  i kinda get it . 
  it 's dragnea :d in our language ... ewww, 
  oohhhh ... that !, 
  damn !, 
  thank you , you 're the boss !, 
  with `` f '' ?!, 
  e : it was just a question . 
  a genuine one . 
  now i know what it means that ** f ** . 
  i googled `` vucic gay nickname '' and got nothing . 
  i reckon i 'm not very knowledgeable about gays though . 
  say what 's his nickname cuz i 'm dying here !, 
  in english ? 
  unfortunately i do n't know serbian at all . 
  e : aaaand of course i 'm downvoted . 
  big surprise lolol, 
  i was sure this is the case . 
  thanks for the details . 
  he 's gay ?!, 
  dunno about that but you surely are the first orthodox majority country to have one . 
  call her horv\u00e1t and be done with it . 
  is she a slave of serbia 's dragnea ? 
  a bunch of heretics ... oh wait, 
  could be . 
  unfortunately i ca n't get rid of this habit . 
  really ?!, 
  c'mon i 'm not that bad . 
  i may be a little bitchy but not very . 
  it was expected with a shitty politician like livu\u021b . 
  nah . . it 's more like a telenovela . 
  with some paramilitary forces recruited from vaslui we could annex not only moldova but the entire south of ukraine . 
  must be some sort of transmissible disease then because the p.m. in question just came back from croatia .
