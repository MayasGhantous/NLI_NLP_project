  looks like us . 
  welcome in eastern europe ... we have bureaucracy !, 
  : / yes ... what ? 
  where did you know that ? 
  who are you ? 
  funny thing is that most of us know that only when it 's suitable to them/us or their/our agenda , here and irl . 
  it was easy since i 'm not exactly stupid . 
  for some of us unfortunately it was very hard . 
   e1 : us/our e2 : i ca n't put myself out of it since i 'm from here too . 
  to be honest , while i 've travelled through serbia , montenegro and albania and back here , i only found great people . 
  except a cop who charged us 50 euros for a mistake i made . 
  :( no warmongers whatsoever and i would n't mind if it would stay the same . 
  after what trump did i guess this is a must . 
  this !!, 
  what about white boys from europe who become terrorists ? 
  would you say it 's a '' * brown * '' '' * girl * '' somewhere they were eager to please too ? 
  or is just our eastern good old misogynist thinking i 'm so much used with ? 
  we had a 17yo boy in romania who 's in jail now too but i never heard once someone thinking he was brainwashed by a `` brown woman '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i know your posts and i liked them mostly but turning this into girls are stupid is not something i like . 
  cheers . 
  / u/executivemonkey for moderator petition online !, 
  that 's because they have a real `` other choice '' while in hungary they do n't yet . 
  edit : i have no idea why i 'm downvoted since i hate the guy like any normal in the head human being . 
  but i recognise there 's not any real alternative to him in hungary today unfortunately . 
  same could be said about us . 
  why they elected trump ? 
  in hungary 's case is more a lack of a better choice ( and that 's not exactly fidesz/orb \u00e1n 's fault ) and lack of interest in politics . 
  okay . 
  ** they ** lol i 'm sick of some people mistaking the party/man in charge with an entire population !, 
  usa = / = trump just like hungary = / = orb\u00e1n, 
  oh , absolutely but i do n't think / u/rainfolder had turbofolk in mind when he ask the first question hahaha edit : i 'm blind !!!, 
  i just skipped what / u/bitchshutupandlisten said . 
  they 're into expanding their pockets and find a way to escape prison more than anything . 
  but i guess your politicians are very similar to them anyway . 
  to be honest i 'm quite a lefty myself and i 'm very welcoming to any increase in at least minimum wage which is way too low , if only they 'll start investing in infrastructure and stop trying to find themselves a way out of prison for stealing public money ... eh , one can only dream . 
  hummm ... 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  only in south-western romania some songs sound like in serbia , in the rest of the country not so much to not at all . 
  at least for my ears . 
  quick guys , send dragnea in bulgaria !, 
  if he 's hungarian i 'm from oltenia !, 
  mures ... clearly a `` mongol '' !!! 1 !!, 
  ! 11 ! ^ / s : ^ d, 
  some people just do n't get it . 
  hate it 's a form of mental blindness . 
  everyone who talks bad ( jokingly or not ) about romania must be a hungarian for `` some '' romanians . 
  when i talk good about romania to `` some '' hungarians i 'm not hungarian anymore for them either . 
  i really doubt that unfortunately . 
  only an idiot can ask such question . 
  e : fast on downvotes slow on thinking . 
  you know how those ( you ) people are named ? 
  fuck you portugal , made me cry at almost 2 am !, 
  i know and i 'm not sad at all , 
  portugal have my heart !, 
  again . 
  bulgaria laaaa, 
  i do n't like this crap !, 
  portugaaaaalllll !!, 
  australia will go down !, 
  huh ... til too !!!, 
  wtf ?!, 
  is anyone famous for their english folk ?!, 
  a non-english i mean . 
  lot 's of germanic genes around here . 
  my grandma is german . 
  but i guess you know better . 
  to be completely honest now ... 
  i was more interested in those who sang it . 
  but i 'm sure the song was gorgeous too !, 
  it 's one of my fav . 
  oh my god spain !, 
  o.o made me dream tonight, 
  they 're way too normal !, 
  australia ... you sang so nice !, 
  i like your heart portugal !, 
  do n't put this on a r/iwanttokillmyself type of sub !, 
  in romania ?!, 
  netherlands is for me !, 
  their song make me cry !, 
  wow armenia you 're song is so african american at first !, 
  super nice !, 
  i would n't mind him to win , i live closer to budapest than bucharest anyway :d edit : it 's true guys , do n't downvote me for a non-political fact !, 
  i only know two songs , hungary and romania . 
  * hungary at first sounded like that bulgarian guy ( the one who look like a woman sometimes , damn i forgot his name ) and then i do n't exactly know at what it sounds . 
  * romania goes full austria/bavaria/switzerland ... with a big romanian pop in the mix . 
  i like them both !, 
  edit : i 'm very subjective here since i only know those two songs . 
  yes unfortunately . 
  that 's why it kinda lost it 's charm . 
  democracy is extremism for extremists, 
  the ~ ~ bible ~ ~ constitution is not for plebs !, 
  it 's for the ~ ~ church ~ ~ government to explain it to you my son , now go and work for your ~ ~ noble ~ ~ oligarch and think abot paying your taxes too , or else you 'll ~ ~ burn ~ ~ ~ ~ in ~ ~ ~ ~ hell ~ ~ rot in jail !, 
  bless you all !, 
  it 's a little better than our politics though but still lame as f. :d, 
  same thing . 
  at least football is nice to look at . 
  except the first two none of the rest is in eu . 
  allowing ro and bg in schengen would mean zip for russia by the way . 
  but it 's nice to imagine ... ( i guess that 's what all these idiots think ), 
  yes , because all of them are from romania no ?
