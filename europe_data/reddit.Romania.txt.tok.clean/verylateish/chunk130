  well , to be honest both countries are huge and stereotypes are inevitable . 
  too bad politicians use them to make you kill eachother . 
  i kinda heard that but ... 
  i did n't believe it . 
  it 's true ?!, 
  i know about people in moldova who think romanians are fascist ( i 'm from a minority in romanian and they do n't look fascist at all ) . 
  yeeeah ... among those may be common knowledge . 
  but really , they do n't think about people there ? 
  i ask as an inhabitant of a small country without firearms or whatever those are named . 
  of course . 
  i would n't even want to imagine how they feel . 
  unfortunately contractors or idiots or ... have mums too . 
  and those killed by them have some mums who cry at home too . 
  looks like you know things , 
  only volunteers ? 
  not only hers lol, 
  i know about tourists . 
  i 'm just curious if some of those tourists are conscripts . 
  conscripts ? 
  man ... have some desert there in russia for calling me a man !, 
  e : ^ / s,
