  damn !!!, 
  yeah ... not many people are shorter than me unfortunately . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  you 're smaller than me . 
  so a kid !, 
  : ^ p ps : a damn smart one though . 
  i 'm only 19 . , 
  well , so it was ceau\u015fescu in the first half of his regime . 
  then he start becoming insane . 
  wow really ?!, 
  til, 
  last year . 
  huh ?!, 
  you really confuse me big time !, 
  this should be stikied too . 
  we need help here .

  two years ago 17yolds were so different . 
  am i talking to the same guy ?!, 
  are you living in south-eastern romania ? 
  ` cuz you really sound like that friend of mine !, 
  must be a 17yolds boys thingy i did n't see while in high . 
  i 'll never understand why turkey is in this situation without communism or/and weak economy . 
  it must be that your leaders through time want you to be weak and stupid , kinda like our populists ( social-dems here , imagine that ) here ? 
  it is a rare thing for me though . 
  oh god ... you sound almost like another reddit friend of mine . 
  politically wise you 're like the sun and the moon but ... age and girl-wise you both could n't be more similar . 
  jilava is my favourite slavic word ( czechs have it too ) , especially when a politician relocate his arse there . 
  * dorel * , cernavod\u0103 ... those two words together kinda scare the hell out of me . 
  i thought the name of that place came from the legendary founder of wallachia , negru vod\u0103 . 
  til . 
  damn ... 
  i really hated this guy . 
  he was such an a. . hole in at least three movies i 've seen in my childhood . 
  boooo !!!, 
  :d edit : he really is a great talent if only his pic here scared me . 
   out of interest all of them ?!?!, 
  ( 0 . o ) well , i guess you wo n't like a girl who look like a wrestler and behave like a chav either . 
  absolutely . 
  but try to look at what i 've said from my pleb-ish perspective . 
  pkk , ira , eta ... wo n't just kill me today only because they can , while isis is just like * the * * void * was in / r/place , they 'll kill me only for the lulz . 
  not that i endorse in any way or form terrorism . 
  yeah , you 're right ... when you 're right , you 're right !, 
  just try it , 
  did n't knew the duke of alba was galician . 
  it came from silva ( or something like that ) which i think it means forest in latin . 
  unfortunately my latin is worse than my german . 
  in romania we missed and cry out loud for an ambassador since two years until they remember we kinda are currently close to ukraine ( only god knows what 's next ) and blessed us with a guy . . not quite here yet but pending . 
  hans klemm , like we did n't had enough german herre : ^ d ex `` rule of law and law enforcement at the u.s. embassy in kabul afghanistan ; ex ambassador in timor-leste 2007-2010 . 
  usually we got only great guys . 
  except nicole and some aunties , i did n't saw women here !, 
  i 'm one .

  no leben ... supporting ... but i 'm okay with your troops here as long as they speak * american * . 
  good . 
  let 's make an alliance and invade * spain * ... what could go wrong ? 
  jump in the ocean ... brazil here i come !, 
  at least there i 'll have only ~ ~ argentina ~ ~ germany to worry about . 
  yes since the other language is the official one . 
  aaah so that 's the cis ' flag !, 
  til thanks !, 
  hahahaha, 
  i would like that too . 
  unfortunately we ( eu ) kinda move too slow when it 's about a lot of things and veeeeery slow when it 's about a common army . 
  i know that . 
  but at least they do n't threaten us with tanks and nuclear strikes every time they are dissatisfied . 
  he 's hot . 
  :d dunno much about his policies but i 'm sure mlp 's ones would be way worse . 
  yes . 
  unfortunately they do n't see us as countries but as zone of influence . 
  portugal . 
  only one neighbour and no minus 25 in the winter . 
  i just hope russia wo n't choose spain though lol, 
  i 'm from a - let 's say ... less loved - minority here but i never had any kind of problems whatsoever . 
  not even in the south where people like me are n't very common . 
  our parliament second chamber 's president , mr. dragnea . 
  he should be in jail not in that position ... that 's what he 's famous for . 
  teleorman is rich now . 
  since dragnea  . 
  i think the area close to motru in gj and mh is quite poor too . 
  they have problems with unemployment there . 
  if it 's good at 4 a.m. ca n't hurt at 7 . 
  lol nah , have faith in god and go with the p\u00e1linka flow . 
  unfortunately politicians ( aka not normal people ) do care about their arses more , so they stir the s #at up from time to time ... so that we forget about their shady businesses with our money . 
  it sure is ... for those who knows them . 
  where i live nobody think about that crap at all . 
  no way mate !, 
  methanol in our fruit p\u00e1linka ?!,
