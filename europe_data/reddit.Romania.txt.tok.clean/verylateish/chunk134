  i just looked what it means . 
  i 'm not a bud , 
  i 'm very sorry but my english knowledge is n't very impressive . 
  you do n't need to downvote me only for a question , in the end we 're in a q/a sub . 
  e : and i still do n't understand . 
  a what ? 
  it 's weirder than usual here . 
  we had snow two weeks ago and i suffer from sun burning since three days ago ( it 's effin horrible ) . 
  now is cold-ish and rain . 
  looks like we gon na have minus 5 this week too . 
  welcome to romania !, 
  minus 22 or ... ?!, 
  you can choose ?!, 
  if yes , i 'm all for it but if not ... dubbing is stupid . 
  and expensive too . 
  now i 'd wish to know russian . 
   edit : saved your comment for further investigation . 
  anime ?!, 
  oh well , i have friends who do that so ... 
  i wo n't hurt you . 
   your english proficiency is low because of it imo . 
  dubbing is the worst thing you can do to a people . 
  trust me , i 've learned more english from t.v. 
  than in school . 
  that dialect who 's words end up in ** u ** , i do n't know the name , i understand more . 
  e : downvotes even here ?!, 
  wtf ?!, 
  it 's just my opinion for f. . . sake !, 
  i 'm very curious , there were in the past different dialects/speeches in russia . 
  i mean those in alaska or vladivostok wrote the same as those in moscow and sp back in late 1700 's ? 
  italian is more or less kinda understandable . 
  listening to normal italians talking , oh boy ... : / edit : written italian is way easier . 
  because you definitely are a devil of course . 
  a little one but very smart little devil . 
  edit : yes i know you 're tall !!, 
  i 'm absolutely sure you are ... not !, 
  little angel eh ... hahaha, 
  grrrr oh , let me change this phrase entirely : `` i want to kill you now , istencs\u00e1sz\u00e1r !!!!!!!! '', 
  some little corrections . 
  usually we have more ballots the single exception is presidential elections ( which i did n't participate yet since my age was n't exactly proper for that ) . 
  you sign before you vote too . 
  * for local elections we have 3 : mayor , local council , county council . 
  * for parliament we have 2 : senat , deputies chamber . 
  * for presidend we have 1 : i guess that 's obvious :d, 
  no we do n't understand eachother . 
  let 's say it like that , pay attention ... ** you 're ** ** always ** ** right ** ** verylateish ** . 
  now say it too ... `` you 're, 
  i was sure !, 
  no you 're not , i am !, 
  i 'm always right : ^ d, 
  at least say it : `` you 're always right '' . 
  imagination is one of humanity 's strongest tools . 
  with kolozsv\u00e1r / cluj as a capital and a federation ... and more open mindedness , why not ? 
  it was more of a joke . 
  but for a * \u021b\u0103r\u0103ncu\u021b\u0103 * like me bucharest is something completely different from any point of view . 
  maybe it 's my area which is different in fact hmmmm , 
  sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld ( szeklerland ) i guess and some parts of danube delta maybe . 
  and of course bucharest . 
  hungary , for personal reasons . 
  since arabs * told * us about it few years ago . 
  eastern part they say but as an inhabitant of a north-western part of romania i think we 'll very red neck-ish when we do n't use hats in the sun . 
   in a serious note , stereotyping much here , eastern and south-western parts . 
  here ?!, 
  edit : bless be you !, 
  hahahaha edit2 : i live in a village in nowere romania . 
  no , it 's normal . 
  we 're red first though and it 's very painful . 
  i did ?!, 
  yeah , i 'm super happy ... lol, 
  i use my garden and the sun ... when it 's here . 
  hmm . . thank you !, 
  hey , i tan myself in the garden . 
  what about us ? 
  well , i 'm not orange mr prahova  le : te \u021bin minte , 
  calling girls who like to have a tan ... well . 
  sour grapes ... ? 
  hmmmm, 
  dunno about other ee countries but here is a thing . 
  people who look like ghosts now ( it was quite a bad weather this spring ) will look at least orange ( if not brown ) in august . 
  nothing i 've heard about . 
  not exactly . 
  i live in a village and people start to wonder about things like `` wtf we have a damn bizzard in april ?!??? '', 
  i know it 's a thing which is happening not a chinese conspiracy . 
  not much unfortunately . 
  i do n't mix paper with glass in the trash bins but that 's about as much as i do . 
  as long as they do n't want to shove their religious belives down my throat i have nothing with them . 
  it 's not like i 'm atheist either ( even if i do n't go to church and my beliefs are n't exactly well structured ) . 
  in fact i had some religious conversations with some people from my village ( the neo-protestant hardcore type ) and we did n't transformed the convos in * fights * . 
  anyway , except the neo-protestant people , in my village only old people go to church ... be them orthodox or reformed and a young religious person is usually laugh at by its friends . 
  lol now that you mentioned it ... hahaha oh , be careful associating ** tak ** with czechs and poles only since scandinavians use it too . 
  even in romanian it has a meaning . 
  of course . 
   and us . 
  dunno about the entire country but i know i 'm proud about tolerance here . 
  . . despite their not so liked ethnicity . 
  last time i boiled ( yeeaaah i know ) some i almost burned my house . 
  where should i 've knew what kind of palinka is boiled-able and what kind is not !, 
  it has many names ... fear of it ... edit : seriously now , stay away from our own if you 're not use with it and you like to drink alot / u/xvoxnihili . 
  oh shut up ... ya old person !, 
  well ... in that case you 're absolutely right .
