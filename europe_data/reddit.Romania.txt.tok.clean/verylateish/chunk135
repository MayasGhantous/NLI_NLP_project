  it 's more of a rhetorical question . 
  i mean , nobody force us to use flairs so if we think ( are afraid ) we 'll be dw because of them then we should not use them . 
  plum brandy !, 
  it can knock down an elephant . 
  for my ears polish does n't sound like russian at all . 
  but i 've heard people speaking polish and russian irl but never macedonian . 
  i guess it 's all about perception . 
  i must 've been mistaken you for another user !, 
  sorry again . 
  that 's because bulgarian has the \u0103 and \u00e2 just like romanian but ( for your/mine ears ) in a wierd language . 
  imo as funnier and ugly a language sounds for one as much that language is related with one 's language . 
  that 's because you find familiar words or sounds pronounced in a ( for you/me ) wierd way . 
  latin-ized ? 
  til as a native hungarian and romanian citizen ( speaking the language ) this is a new one . 
  thank you very much for the input . 
  not bulgarian , since you 're from bucharest ? 
   flairs nobody force us to put one here or on / r/europe . 
  likes : * * stupid * questions are n't erased . 
  * even if i live here and i travelled around our continent i learn new things . 
  dislikes : * none ... yet, 
  unfortunately human brain is '' * of * * tricky * '' . 
  we usually associate unrelated things only because for us those things look similarly enough . 
  you understand russian , if i remember correctly , do you understand what those people say ? 
  genuinely curious !, 
  duch and english are in the same group ( germanic ) and quite similar . 
  macedonian and romanian , in my opinion , are way more different . 
  ** hungarian ?!, 
  both of you made that connexion only because a song sounds * arabic * for you . 
  i only looked at news and it does n't sound one bit arabic for me . 
  arabic ?!, 
  german * r * is more arabic than this language . 
  a wierd mix of what i know serbian bulgarian russian sound like with lot 's of * ski * in it . 
  very slavic . 
  my opinion . 
  hehehe , 
  yes . 
  i have an ethnic connection with hungary . 
  traitor !, 
  since according to my father i `` ca n't even boil water '' it 's pizza . 
  thank you italy !, 
  `` br\u00e2nz\u0103 de burduf '' of course . 
  digi24 . 
  i trust them . 
  fake news here is rtv and a3 . 
  they 're like junkie news on steroids . 
  `` oh look , another human being ! '', 
  lol, 
  do n't even think to keep the windows open or you 'll die !, 
  i 'm both . . 
  so i included hungary too in my statement it in a way, 
  do you want to die , do n't you ? 
  huh ?!, 
  the door and the window is open !!!!!!, 
  think about your health !!!, 
  but ... 
  i 'll close both and bring you two aspirin . . and a blanket !, 
  ( cuz it 's only 35 degrees outside ) lol, 
  oh . . the almighty ** curent ** . 
  it 's a very important thing here lol, 
  corruption !, 
  albania is awesome !, 
  i was there . 
  unfortunately some people there live in worse conditions than here , but that 's only cuz of their idiotic rulers and lack of vision from their govs. 
  the people there are incredibly hospitable !, 
  so they look for a better life . . that 's it . 
  my opinion . 
  i think some of the mods are the same . 
  it was a suggestion only anyway . 
  maybe they could made a similar thing on / r/europe . 
  i bite that thing on top , since i never could rip it with my hand and then peel half of it and ate it then peel it to the `` tale ? '', 
  and eat the rest . 
  that 's it . 
  this sub is about europe not usa . 
  trump questions should be put in another place . 
  but since i guess some will do that here too , you better ask that on / r/europemeta . 
  it was today i think . 
  at least today i see it . 
  nice :p i feel like russia now lolol : ^ d edit : less developed but with way more bigger weapons . 
  no , he said that a nation with allies is a successful nation . 
  and he reckons russia 's * war * . 
  look up !, 
  see what that `` defense secretary '' nominee , or whatever , said about nato . 
  you have tanks ?!, 
  i love it !, 
  bring more !, 
  that 's what i think .
