  your username it 's confusing for people on / r/europe just as german compound words are for me :d, 
  they have * metode * my friend : ^ p, 
  usually steel doors are the number one sign for a thief that it 's something valuable there . 
  i 'm not from bucharest ( not even close ) so for me north is pipera and some parts of district 1 , 
  steel door aka rich family ? 
  i 'm only 19 and her dialect is transylvanian saxon and she pushed me to learn it so hard that i start hating the language . 
  now she gave up hahaha, 
  hehehe you 're a funny baguette  danke !, 
  yes of course but i can understand them since i know ( kinda ) english language . 
  unfortunately my german is a joke so if the compound words do n't have spaces i 'm confused . 
  i thought gottkanzler is a family name : ^ d, 
  that 's the spirit , 
  they are quite confusing for a non-native , 
  i know since my mother tongue has them too and my grandma is german . . 
  unfortunately i was n't able to learn almost anything in german , to her great pain : ^ d i surely wo n't tell her i did n't knew what gottkanzler is , the pain could kill her lolol, 
  now i get it . 
  thank you !, 
  i googled that word and only german sites comes up . . and some schulz pics lolol, 
  who ? 
  he won in spain though . . after how many parliamentary elections ? 
  * summer can be very hot . 
  we have more than 40 centigrade sometimes . 
  usually 30-35 . 
  mostly in july and august . 
  * autumn is hot in september and can be quite cold and with snow in october but rarely . 
  * winter is very cold ( for my taste at least ) with heavy snow , blizzards and minus 25 or less sometimes . 
  * spring is my fav season . 
  march is usually still a winter month were i live but april and first part of may is awesome . 
  last part of may is usually summer already . 
  it 's not louisiana-like humid but it is n't arizona-dry either . 
  all in all a temperate continental climate . 
  now it 's cold and we have snow on the ground . . and i hate it :d, 
  : ^ ) edit : oh now i see it 's the head of the govs you said not head of states . 
  then dacian ciolo\u015f has my vote . 
  north bucharest and ilfov county . 
  bastards ! ^ ^ / s : ^ d, 
  we have our share but i think many confuse curiosity ( especially in the countryside ) with racism . . 
  they should visit black sea resorts in the summer and see how * racist * girls are with black guys hehehe , 
  it was downvoted ?!, 
  maybe by people who think any eastern european is a dumb racist redneck and will linch black people on the spot . . or something like that lolol, 
  not in romania though , 
  who gives a dime on traditional architecture when you 're in valhalla . . in the morning you 're f 'd though if police find you . 
  here is n't mexico , you 'll be free after you 'll say `` trump hate russia '' : ^ d,
