  the evil greek teach him that , 
  everybody forget about : * b\u0103icoi - could be translated as * hey * * testicle * * izvorul pizda babei - * old * * woman * * cunt * spring they say is very healthy to drink from that spring lolol :p, 
  not to mention jean calvin : ^ d, 
  of course , but not * basically * * everyone * , 
  i 'm okay now , just a little shaken lol : ^ ), 
  i 'm protestant and wierd as it might be for other people , i have some icons in my house . 
  in my room i have a big catholic one with the scene of nativity and another four very little ones ( 2 catholic and 2 orthodox ) with virgin mary and baby jesus . 
  disclaimer : despite being a calvinist i live in a heavy orthodox/catholic rural area ( only my village is majority protestant here ) and my parents are friends with two catholic priests and with our village orthodox priest family . 
  edit : i 'm not quite religious though lol, 
  i 'm guessing you talk about bucharest not romania . 
  and even in bucharest and the south there are big communities of non-orthodox people . 
  especially when writing lol :d, 
  shut up !!!!, 
  then i like the nederlands more than i thought !, 
  here , have three kisses, 
  nah , it 's his fault !, 
  unfortunately i did . . it 's not possible to keep anything in you when it 's about kkk ... 
  your music is gorgeous !, 
  so do n't complain !!, 
  here is . . 
  where ? 
  grrrrrrr i 'm triggered now !!!!, 
  think about your parents and you 'll have an easier time not to hate them . 
  some of us talk like some of them . . not all though , 
  what about in s\u0103tmar and maramure\u0219 ? 
  you seem more knowledgeable than anyone i 've heard . 
  why should those from slatina do n't like to be called olteni since even their county is named olt ?!, 
  dunno much about ppl from arge\u0219 though . . maybe they are similar with those from v\u00e2lcea ? 
  a kk thrown on his head would fit him more in my opinion !, 
  for me they looked more stuck-up . 
   ftfy :p i hate smart kids . . grrrr :p, 
  how do you think they are , in regard to how we are ? 
  leather jackets thugs wannabes or nice and helpful ? 
  of course at * your * * age * you 'll be unable to told that to me since i 'm older than you ! ^ / s : ^ dd, 
  hmmmmmmmm kk would suit * him * just well !, 
  or kkk .

  traitor !!, 
  ! ^ / s seriously now , thanks for answering  where were you in italy ? 
  i 've seen their youth while in ibiza and they were quite arrogant and wear leather jackets even when it 's more than 30 outside lolol . . but they were only young male tourists .
