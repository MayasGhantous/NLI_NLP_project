  i `` understand '' killings and robbing in big cities but ( coming from a little village from nw romania ) i ca n't cope with this . 
  i was very curious about albania , but i think i 'll try to satisfy my curiosity another time . 
  :( edit : cannabis ?!, 
  okay now , i may be completely ignorant but is n't police business to find those things/places/people whatever ?!, 
  i mean , we do n't talk about himalayan glaciers here !, 
  no offence but if that 's true i could go to afghanistan cos it 's sounds same ( regarding safety and those guys have higher mountains ) . 
  sexual orientation : ** it 's not a choice ** ** it 's not a disease ** those words were written in reality on that banner !, 
  peace  i 'm 18 wednesday , so i can drink until i drop dead ( from a legal point of view ) . 
  and finally ride my motorcycle on a public road !, 
  i live in a country where i 'm a minority ( a historical one , but minority nevertheless ) , in a village which has no less than 6 ( six ) ethnic groups . 
  so , excepting the case i would be ( god forbid !!! ), 
  raped by somebody from a different group ( and cos of it became insane ) i do n't think i would . 
  plus , even if you would be right , who would want to immigrate in szatm\u00e1r / maramaros except few brits and germans who want to live in the middle of the nature ( read it as `` in the middle of nowhere '' hahahahaha ) ? 
  sorry , i think i overreacted ( well , i definitely overreacted ) . 
  i really need to be more chill when talking to nice people here . 
  i 'm not that bitchy irl , but on the internet , i do n't know why , i 'm very circumspect about anything and everything and behave like a bitch with people like you who do n't deserve that . 
  it 's not who i am at all !, 
  again , i 'm very sorry !, 
  haha now i realized how it sounds . 
  no , i was n't drunk since it 's illegal for me to do that until wednesday :p i think i was carried away by my emotions , like always when talking about religious stuff , because i kinda believe in something but i 'm not sure in what ... * or i want to believe . 
  * ^ yup , ^ i ^ sounded ^ drunk . 
  ^ i 'm ^ so ^ ashamed ^ :(, 
  op , there is n't any sub for ukip members to circlejerk ? 
  if it is then please stay there . 
  and btw , you seem to hate people from this country for some reason , it could be because you were scammed by somebody from here or because you are a member of a minority yourself and try to find another scapegoat for mainstream english public ? 
  looks like they 're stealing the precious english air , in op 's opinion . 
  you should joke about something else !, 
  and very much would kill myself before doing that !, 
  it was his statement !, 
  i do n't think i was wrong . 
  i absolutely want to ... are you insane ? 
  edit : just questioning . 
  that 's stupid , of course i believe in anything only for ... nothing . 
  i very much believe in something , , really do n't know what but i do . 
  looks like jesus , with a funny hat . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  i knew that already !, 
  i just said `` iron curtain '' cos it was , somehow , even for you , from a political point of view . 
  and it 's ma'am if you 're into protocols , 
  i 'm sorry if i , somehow , offended someone with my very own way of not-knowledge  from the communist countries . 
  that 's alright with you ? 
  i do n't know how much of human face anything under the iron curtain was , but my uncle could rise our family only by working there . 
  disclaimer : my uncle is my father 's single brother . 
  he is dead now , unfortunately !, 
  too bad you guys ( all of you ex . 
  yugoslavs ) were n't able , back then , to just let the nationalism apart and go on together . 
  you would 've been a shining example for all of us eastern europeans just like you were in the communist times . 
  wow !, 
  yeah i know about mr. hollande but like you 've said ... berlusconi takes the cherry on top of the cake , especially since he was corrupt like hell !, 
  i think you confuse us with paris . 
  well , he should say it then !, 
  i ca n't imagine an hungarian or romanian black !, 
  just like i ca n't a white nigerian . 
  i 'm sorry , but i that 's the way it is !, 
  edit : downvoting wo n't change the fact that from an ethnic point of view , romanians and hungarians are white and nigerians are black . 
  i really did n't understand what 's wrong with that ?!, 
  total war for them , i 'm hungarian not sz\u00e9kely , if that 's what they want . 
  and they do n't . 
  i think !, 
  spoiling the fun those germans !, 
  ze me i 'm very dangerous now . 
  i 'll definitely drink an esspresso now and go to sleep , dreaming about that guy !, 
  edit : i zero gon na dream about that guy , he 's older than me dad !, 
  she has a. ... ze husband ? 
  crocs in scots are usually philippinos . 
  yeah right . 
  bollocks , why crap around those midgets when you have berlusconi just a little southeast across the alps . 
  those merkel things must be boring like hell . 
  ive see it two nights ago . 
  was on tcm . 
  try to stop me , you idiot !, 
  `` you know what , i want to buy a dress from your shop !, 
  and i very much want you to put it on me `` . 
  imagine if you 'll be fed sweets for couple of ages and then you 'll receive a big sour lemon ... 
  even i will be out there throwing stones in anything on me sight . 
  well , most of germans ca n't st. ... ... ... ... ... . ; ^ d i hope it 's okay now , 
  not to mention that germans ca n't stand inferior than them workers in an third world country ( in their opinion ) !, 
  to be honest i even saw poles who tried to do the `` we 're superior than you '' game here . . was a bad game for them here ( dunno if it 's same in another parts of the country ) . 
  i think political parties are , in a way , quite like their political ancestors . 
  and in romania there 's no recent ancestors but the communist party which is a big fan of dealing with low representation of women , but in the same time it was just like anything else before world war 2 . 
  what we see is lots of women in judicial system and almost nothing in political life . 
  it 's very much our fault too , but do you comprehend even the idea of an feminist movement in romania ? 
  cos i do n't . 
  workers unions in private sector is practically non-existent !, 
  you say the truth there . 
  i understand , we usually talk in english so it 's ok to be neutral ( gender wise ) when we talk , a little bit more than in romanian that 's it . 
  anyway i do n't mind , i 'm just tired to correct people . 
  but it 's my fault , i should have choose a name like `` virgin mary '' or something like that lolol : ^ d, 
  i may be from satu mare but i 'm sure i know where 's my country 's borders ; ^ d there is lots of brown in the south and in tulcea county . 
  looks like the biggest river in `` normal in the head '' europe does n't bring too much kids ( read as prospects/prosperity ) . 
  edit : as a matter of fact i think you are right and i 'm very wrong , that 's north bulgaria !!!, 
  fuck that phone and my stupid arrogance !, 
  thank you !, 
  that 's a long name :d, 
  really ?!, 
  as a matter of fact , i think it 's very much possible . 
  edit : no need for downvoting a simpleton like me !, 
  unfortunately you 're right . 
  wow !!!, 
  that 's wrong !,
