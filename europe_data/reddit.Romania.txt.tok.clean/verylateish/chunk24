  my deepest respect for them !, 
  as a countryside inhabitant my personal opinion is exactly on the contrary to yours . 
  that 's why we should n't use it . 
   but common sense would say i 'm more right than you :p, 
  maybe , just maybe , majority of those who leave and do n't come back have higher education . 
  because i absolutely ca n't believe that majority of those who leave are like that . 
  i guess your grandchildren will talk italian with moldovan accent ... : ^ \u00fe, 
  lol your answer is exactly like the stereotypical polandball for bulgaria :d, 
  when you 'll have five pensioners living on the back of one working person , i think you 'll see why it is n't exactly good for a country to have lowering demographics . 
  it was a joke , one based on stereotypes and quite bad but a joke nonetheless . 
  i think . 
  let the lamb out of this and i 'm with you 100 % , 
  same is asia , i think . 
  damn , you got me !, 
  to be completely honest , i also use reddit to improve my english and romanian skills and it kinda worked , 
  well , i tried to be a lady lol it does seems like an ( a ? ), 
  easy thing , until you realize how much chaos is in there : / disclaimer : i know i 've made tons of mistakes here too :d, 
  happy easter , ya schismatics : ^ \u00fe, 
  now that you said it . . no `` a 's '' or `` an 's '' in the title . 
  not to say i do n't appreciate his tips . 
  those `` a 's '' and `` an 's '' always confused me . 
  `` you 're supposed to put that before this because this may be that but sounds like this so ... . . '' jesus christ !!!, 
  english language is such a pain in the rear sometimes !, 
  oh shut your wallet , you 're not that big !, 
  darko szarko number two , gim me one like this guy and i 'll ... definitely recommend anything else but : / ... france will rule the world !, 
  edit : anything else but france edit 2 : many words . 
  i 'm always spot on / s :d, 
  politicians , both spectre of the same crap , are thieves and more or less cc judges are appointed by the thieves . 
  sometimes , thieves have an argument and then we , normal stupid people , kill each other and after some time you 'll see ( if still alive and sane ) the same thieves ( or their families , followers etc ) kissing eachother on the cheeks on tv . 
  after the war is over !, 
  i do n't quite know what 's going on there . 
  when i 'll figure it out ... 
  i 'll do my best to send you back into oblivion , until then we must be friends :d, 
  i 'm a very peaceful woman myself , but i still like to argue . . here , not irl , 
  small . . 
  the gov can suck . . d if cc say it and the prez is just a prolonged tentacle of cc which is the last defense in front of dictatorship . 
  at least that 's what i think it is here . 
  not sure about the judges mortality , but fuck me if anything here would dare to say anything bad about them ( i mean officials of course ) . 
  i kinda hate cc president . 
  but i 'm nobody ... so i suck it and shut up . 
  not to mention that i also hate some of their shits !, 
  damn , and i thought i 'll have a fight here !, 
  i 'm not upset . 
  i hope you are aware i do n't quite exactly share your political views by the way :d, 
  and ... who 's the one who dares to judge it ? 
  who 's the one who gon na say the verdict is constitutional , if the constitutional court is out ? . . 
  i know , but taking with someone is better than ignoring . 
  and i learn a lot from him , so . . edit : readability, 
  well . . , i wo n't judge people only because they have a different political view . 
  he/she was nice enough to answer my questions and even if i do n't resonate with it . 
  it 's not like he 's ( that guy who died ) austrian president ( pm ) . 
  that was a lapsus in the statement , nothing unusual . 
  our cc does it too , but it 's verdicts are n't questioned . 
  i wo n't say anything about what i feel about it . 
  edit : dang m8 , you really got some downvotes !, 
  what the hell ? 
  so , no matter if the gov does n't publish something cc approved ( approved or . . ) this law is legal . 
  i like that !, 
  do n't hate me , i kinda understand your position ( we had something similar few years ago ) but i strongly believe a constitutional court should be able to rule above everything and any particular interests should be left aside when it 's about this institution . 
  you really must develop it , so i understand what you mean . 
  oh i know that , i 'll be a law student next year ( of course you see i did n't say i 'll try to . . , damn i 'm so confident lol ) . 
  the question is how you do that , sueing the constitutional court ? 
  i ca n't do that , our cc it is exactly that !, 
  :d romanian cc is not only the third chamber of the parliament here , they are the chamber , if a law gets there of course . 
  so ... who won ? 
  thank you !, 
  i was sure it is something wrong with my perception of the word since i 've seen it used before in english when it 's about tragedies , but since in this country 's official language ( and other languages i more or less know , from indo-european family ) it means something closer to a happy thing i assumed they were wrong in this case . 
  i always assume idiotic things , do n't mind me , 
  this !, 
  this till the end of times !, 
  many in the we unconsciously ( since they know how we struggle ) probably projected their own problems when it 's about securing immigrants wellbeing . 
  unfortunately we lack their resources and damn me if i 'll be supportive to keep them from my own money when my grandma has a pension closer to zero that 1000 , and i talk about ron 's not $ even if i 'm very much left leaning and i really find their fate horrible . 
  well , i tell you something . . that 's confusing !, 
  :d how the hell they did that ?!, 
  who accused them ? 
  how `` they '' appointed judges to `` judge '' this case ? 
  who appointed them ? ... 
  damn !, 
  confirmed confusion right there :d, 
  is n't constitutional court the supreme court ? 
  were n't they supposed to defend the supreme law of a country , the constitution ?!, 
  edit : a very late edit , i 'm very interested in law and if my questions are somehow stupid that 's because i 'm still very young and stupid myself . 
  i just want to learn , that 's it . 
  downvote away boys , 
  looks like it 's quite a difference between albanians from albania and their brethren from ex-yu . 
  could be the only good thing a repression did for a country , make you less religious  oh and i visited albania last autumn by the way , gorgeous landscape and beautiful inhabitants , 
  and dutch soldiers guard it . . oh wait !, 
  in fact i think is not unlikely . 
  it 's not like it did n't happened before ( sephardic jews who converted to christianity in spain ... ) and communists in albania were quite crazy and probably prone to use medieval `` teachings '' to reach their goals . 
  yep , i 've seen that now , 
  are/were catholics so much into their faith to respect the lent ? 
  nobody i know here , be it catholic or orthodox do that , except some old people and from what i know it was n't very different back in the days . 
  sorry , i may sound stupid but i 'm reformed ( kinda , since i do n't quite attended church at all lol ) and i 'm not exactly the most knowledgeable person when it 's about apostolic churches . 
  thanks a bunch for the link !, 
  i 'm not able to read it now ( too long + on the phone + without google translate my bosnian is zero ) but i save it for later . 
  very interesting , thank you again !, 
  77 % that 's crazy !, 
  i think ** commemoration ** would suit better than ** anniversary ** in this case . 
  but since my english is crap i may be very wrong . 
  wait a sec , i get it how they would know if you 're a muslim ( you would n't eat pork ) but catholic ... ?!,
