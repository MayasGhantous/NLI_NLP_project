  rain rain and more rain , every time i talk to her we talk about rain : /, 
  how 's the snow around your stuck car ? 
  i 'm not joking . 
  ** what ** ?!? 
  i 'll do anything for that :'(, 
  now i see , even saturday ?!? 
  yeah , the minimum here will be -22 , saturday : / . 
  thank you god , i appreciate it very much . . not :(, 
  all my childhood i was afraid by the `` goat ! '', 
  is the russians fault anyway , and finns , since this c. . py weather come from there !!!, 
  damn them !, 
  you lucky bastarts , we had -28 last night and the worse is still to come : '' ( i want summer !!!, 
  please god !, 
  depends what you like , i do n't like red wine ... put me down like nothing else  try tokaj !, 
  get real people !!, 
  i do n't know about that , but i can send . 
  must talk to my dad though : /, 
  tur\u021b , you can bet your self on it  i hate it !, 
  you must focus on something and from nowhere came a romanian word , it 's hard even for me : /, 
  you need p\u00e1link\u00e1 ?!, 
  our is stronger than anything else !, 
  really !, 
  you can set a huge condominium in fire with it : /, 
  yes , that 's from greece to czech and ukraine !, 
  we mingled eachother like crazy back in the days !, 
  edit : what 's wrong , a little , with your assumption is that aromanian is a dialect of romanian . 
  it 's my opinion that it is a different language , which i do n't understand . 
  my opinion . 
  edit 2 : of course , we did n't even touch eachother !, 
  heavy ment red , very red : / for the winter is , boiled red-ish wine with cinnamon and sugar . 
  if you want ** heavy ** we have something else , plum brandy 80 \u00b0 at least !, 
  i have wine , much too heavy and dry for my taste though . 
  my mum has her stash of wine , for her friends and our grannies , made with honey . 
  delicious , 
  keep him !, 
  in like seven countries even , beat that , 
  oh god , you did n't . . !, 
  it 's more like condolences : / it 's -19 on a car thermometer now , i 'm not sure how reliable it is tho . 
  gulf stream has almost nothing to do with our climate , we 're far too east , meddi5e . 
  scandinavia is way warmer than russian steppe . 
  i 've seen on telly two days ago that on the mountains the temp feel was -69 . 
  i know it was because of the wind . . but really now , here was -10 !, 
  where 's that lovely may : '' (, 
  cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 's are the `` worse '' for those who do n't know romanian and even for those who know it , cuz they use lots of romanian words as `` spital '' and `` ma\u0219in\u0103 '' , the rural folks who never attend a class of magyar that is . 
  edit : that 's a hearsay though , i never was there , so do n't put to much credence to it , 
  like you did n't know we have those kind of temperatures ? 
  i think you forget how north europe is in fact and that we , very unfortunately , are located quite close to the russian/ukrainian steppe  it 's colder here than in most of we and even parts of ne , f. . kin continental climate :'(, 
  oh , would be a dream come true !, 
  i want some green grass ( not on the table since i 'm not a cow . . physically at least ) !!!, 
  unusual ?!? 
  ( 0 . o ) i remember few years ago the snow was almost to our windows . 
  well , the morning is the colder ( not sure if it 's the right way to say it ) part of the . . night . 
  i absolutely hate the winter , with passion !, 
  except the last half of december of course , 
  yeah , you try to be a 18yo girl with two bro 's and share the bathroom with them  edit : to not that . 
  in the daytime ?!?!, 
  looks like we 'll have up ( or should i say down ? ), 
  till -25 in the next two nights , fortunately not where i live . . 
  thank goodness lol, 
  not really , we 're a family of five and i 'm the only girl ( with two idiots as bigger brothers ) . 
  the third bathroom was built only four years ago when my father extend the house ( to my relief and joy ) . 
  nah , you kinda spoke from . . your toilet . 
  i live in the countryside and we have three indoor toilets . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've learned something new . 
  man , you really have some . . 
  dialects !!!, 
  wow !, 
  indeed !, 
  what 's there in ne ? 
  only german speaking people or . . ? 
  that 's insane !, 
  my friends live here , so i do n't have a good insight into urban turkish youth , unfortunately . 
  oh , ex-girlfriend ... hmmm , now depends on how you broke up / s : ^ ), 
  well , from what i see and what i 've heard from some turkish friends , he 's an idiot . 
  he likes power and that is n't very good for his country , he may not be stupid but the way he leads turkey is idiotic ... so he 's an idiot . 
  more or less idiot then , from our pov , 
  my first thought was `` blackmail , that wo n't get you anywhere turkey '' . 
  but , more or less , he 's kinda right even if we do n't like it . 
  they are overwhelmed by those people , lebanon too , plus the problems with the kurds and all those suicide attacks and the cherry on top they have an idiot as president . 
  i wonder what any of us will think about this situation if we were in their shoes . 
  edit : they not their, 
  oh , well it 's still funny ... especially since i understand what he was into  thanks , really !, 
  really ?!, 
  well , i 'm not very well versed in this but she seems to do her job . 
  of course i may be wrong . 
  those were canadians fortunately . . or unfortunately , 
  does n't look very appealing these days , with all the snow and freezing cold but at least it 's better than in the southern counties . 
  i like you better , at least you know us !, 
  we are , but we still profit !, 
  who 's he  ? 
  now i look at snow !, 
  so you think we better keep it there ? 
  why not have it ? 
  but tourists may or not come , while that thing is there for sure !, 
  damn , that 's nothing mr mod , we only have a friendly talk  could you tell to my friend , who erased my/his comments , please , 
  you 're red after those three days of pain ?!, 
  your brother does a portuguese skin only cos he can tan ?!, 
  swedes can tan my american friend !, 
  i know how it is , i live in this environment and i 'm sick of what i 've seen until now .
