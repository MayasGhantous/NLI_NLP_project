  and yeah , i 'm hungarian ... not a crazy one lolol and i do n't have any kind of separatist mentality . 
  that 's obvious , what they lack is fear of authorities , police in this instance and prison , which will be better than almost anything they had back home . . 
  i think . 
  it 's first time in my life when i preferred an american/russian type of police and prisons for us : /, 
  hahaha yeah , pretty likely he 'll be raped by me : ^ ), 
  i thought about that too ( unveiled women ... etc ) but , and i do n't necessarily think about this sole incident , if maybe for afghans it could be true . . syrians surely have seen unveiled women . 
  not to mention they absolutely saw them in turkey and the balkans . 
  why they did not behaved like that in serbia or croatia but do that in germany , finland , france ?!? 
  could be cos they see we police and public as not tough enough ? 
  i think i will , i 'm a country girl who knows how to kick a guy 's balls and i bite too  no worries , i know how western europe is since i 've travelled a lot . . my bf is irish lol , that 's why i was very surprised by what 's going on . 
  thank you !, 
  well , those other women were individuals too , it 's not like they all were a group and what happened to them was only in one place and in a small timespan . 
  and regardless , me as an individual am still part of the group who was targeted . 
  not to mention that i think it would be a shame for what we all stand for , to be forced to change my friendly behavior and dressing code only to be safe in europe or to suit some people 's archaic worldview . 
  excuse my english , i 'm on the phone and my blood boils when i read about things like that , 
  what the hell is going on ?!? 
  where the f. . . there idiots think they are ? 
  did n't they saw a woman until now ? 
  and hitlers and ... c'mon now , let 's no fall in the other extreme . 
  though , as a woman , i find this sexual-assault epidemia very disturbing and even concerning ( as in i 'm concerned about my own security , cos i 'll go to w europe soon ) . 
  edit : i absolutely exaggerated when i put hitler there , beside lepen and trump , for the sake of comparation . 
  one extreme is to just let everyone in , the other is . . just like the american op said `` more lepens and trumps '' , so why not more hitlers if we are into that . 
  why be pleased with a clown like trump when we can have a mastermind ? 
  oh , those glorious things , i have tears in my eyes ... : ^ d, 
  how so ? 
  it was a joke , of course i can make fun of everything i want here . . we 're not yet into politically correct censure . 
  yet !, 
  vampiress . 
  and i 'll be back always ... `` i 'm your conscience ... hahaha '' be careful ... 
  i do n't use that , got enough in my language ( my grandpa is the master in those things , romanian and hungarian lol ) . 
  but i use a lot the word `` pula '' : ^ d, 
  usually , from your neck of the wood , it is !, 
  not so much !, 
  i care about them , they are human beings who said their mind !, 
  you know what , f. . k allah !, 
  and that gamer . . mohammed !, 
  and maybe i do n't buy the paper , but we know about it , . . 
  i may buy it if i 'll be in paris/lyon again . 
  in bikini and smoking pot !, 
  i 've seen on reddit , do n't remember where , that if you insult allah you have three days for repentance , but if you 'll insult mohammed you must be killed immediately . 
  dunno if true , so do n't just jump in my head people !!!!!!, 
  that 's like putting the prophet before the god he represent !, 
  haram like f. . k !!!, 
  i know that ** i ** never heard about that paper before the attacks , neither anyone i know , and now we all know what is charlie hebdo !, 
  that 's why i said what i 've said !, 
  i never intended any kind of disrespect and i definitely do n't know their current state . 
  if you think my post was anything else than that ... 
   he 's a jolly ** black ** man ... ftfy :p edit : fix it to suit to your neighborhood , american !, 
  santa , you blasphemous atheist !!!, 
  yes , it 's my right to do that !, 
  a right i 've earn from birth , as a eastern european , to swear at god , jesus , virgin mary , all . . 3 billion saints , pope , patriarchs , churches , pastors and any god known in thee galaxies besides our own and . . and yes , to swear at allah and mohammed too !, 
  but that 's just me , a barbarian woman from the butthole of europe and i do n't know any better : ^ ), 
  that 's cynicism \u00d7 10 ... and very true in the same time . 
  yeah , i think you 're quite spot on . 
  he did n't cared a lot about his own people back in 2011 , when all this tragedy started , so he definitely do n't give a damn about our opinions . 
  but would n't be a thrill to have , at least , someone close to him here , doing a ama ? 
  maybe russia is a better deal for you , eh ? 
  because a ministry for propaganda it 's just that , boosting patriotic duty kinda feeling in its own people and spreading all sorts of dirt in enemies head . 
  i 'm a future lawyer and a girl , trust me , i know how it works  late edit : not that you , if ukrainian , would n't be completely entitled to pay your enemy with the same coin !, 
  by the way , if i walk i 'll be in ukraine in less than one hour from my home , 
  yep , you 're joking :d, 
  you 're joking , do n't you ? 
  my parents vaccinated the hell out of me , they knew i could n't go to central africa without tons of vaccines . . so they gave it to me :'( thanks god !, 
  plus the usual two i 've got when i was a couple of months old , so yes . . they knew what 's best for me ; ^ ), 
  trust me , i 'm with you here !, 
  i 'm very much for ukraine in this conflict , not that it means anything , but my belief is that . . even if for the moment propaganda ( lies and spreading crap ) can be useful , in the long run will bite you in the ass big time . 
  ukraine should just get rid of corrupted crooks and say the truth , this is the way to be trusted and respected by everyone in the end . 
  thank you !, 
  i think i 'll read it tomorrow . 
  but this was about / r/europe , 
  ( \u00d3_\u00d2 ) prison for one month sounds great , where do i sign ? 
  . . they 'd be better than in a hellhound in arizona for a million kilometres ( not miles and soccer is football ) , 
  i 'm 18 and i think i 'll very much do something like that too , if nobody would say is forbidden . 
  no , i would n't but still . . 
  they 're like two sisters who hate eachother , but are . . well , still sisters : ^ ), 
  well , to be honest i do n't think they 're quite independent even now . 
  no , do n't take my words for something different !, 
  yes , ukraine is very much entitled to defend itself by any means its consider . 
  i just think the truth is better than propaganda , which usualy is more lies dressed in semi-true shelves , my two cents . 
  thank you for the link , i know and it 's still propaganda !, 
  russia is a giant , ukraine is just a country who never had independence until , more or less , now !, 
  big difference . 
  and still , a propaganda ministry is stupid , no matter who play with it . 
  they were usually from the naples area , but if you know more ... 
  unfortunately it 'll change in couple of days here :( minus 25 for me in january !, 
  f. . k !!, 
  edit : it went plus 14 where i live , oh life in december , 
  awww , only for them poor !, 
  france and germany must be education hubs !, 
  mmmm ?!, 
  late edit : france has calais jungle and lots of ghettoes , we do n't !, 
  oh and lot 's of us can speak their language and less than one dozen french can speak magyar or romanian . 
  i had to praise my smart ass  . 
  you left some mafiosos at me door and i send them packing into your prisons , so give me a break about those gypsies . . or i 'll start talking about your pedos ... !, 
  thank you !, 
  like in a `` counter propaganda '' ? 
  i 'm still in school , i kinda am remembered those things , 
  oookay , let 's hope it 's not that !, 
  is it ? 
  information politics ministry ?!,
