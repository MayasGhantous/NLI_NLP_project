  well , i really am in `` one of those days '' and i do n't feel confrontational at all , quite a bit of to be honest :( italy is a country who can build a fucking school !, 
  damn , italy could bring literacy in a country like c.a.r. 
  and feel nothing , money wise !, 
  why do you need some idiot with at least ten slave concubines back home to build a school in italy ?!, 
  i 'm sorry but it 's not normal , at least for me it does n't seem normal . 
  i do n't think we even had one this century , except the king 's flag . . oh , you mean the communist one ? 
  lol, 
  since when my ego is involved in this . 
  i 'm not very egotistical . 
  i do n't think italy should cover its way of life only because some big shot from the middle east will build a school !, 
  that 's all !, 
  for god sake , you sound like some african country in front of the british master . . xix th century type of things !, 
  i 'm outraged by your answer sir . . nah , just joking : ^ ), 
  that 's just horribly wrong !, 
  since when borders matters in schengen ?!, 
  they care about `` stealing jerbs , benefits , gypsies ... ... '' , of course those things ( when exists . . just like all of us and more moving to britain ) are there regardless of schengen but they do n't quite seems to know that . 
  `` could '' is the name !, 
  we have a boy here ... * clap * * clap * * clap * bravo !, 
  i 'm always right ... more or less, 
  do n't push it . . and i still think i 'm right , somehow . . !, 
  right : /, 
  i did n't mean no disrespect or something . . 
  i know :( but i still want to believe t. . . 
  damn , you really know how to make a woman sad :(, 
  you know more than me about that place !, 
  kind of normal seeing your flair , 
  i know how they enjoy those ... unfortunately :d, 
  no , it would n't be such a fuss because japanese do n't come here in droves and africans usually like a good build man ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ absolutely ^ ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ ^ stand ^ ^ ^ them ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yeah ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right, 
  what ? 
  or you could 've been so kind to just say that to the poster who i 've responded . 
  i absolutely know what was about , it was a big deal here few days ago !, 
  i think you are more or less right , and pivo must be a beer ? 
  tatars and turks are very okay . 
  yeah , i think you 're right ... even if in a way you called me a ... female dog : ^ d but it 's not normal !, 
  we all kinda live according to that saying and it 's wrong !, 
  i know  you are from britain , so english ... for us :p ok , if someone from there was so offended . . in the place i am uk is called anglia . 
  i 'm very sorry , but that 's the truth . 
  if i must lie for useless karma . . 
  i wo n't do it lol, 
  what ?!?!, 
  ^ ^ got ^ ^ a ^ ^ purse ^ ^ with ^ ^ that ^ ^ flag ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ say ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ world, 
   broken away part of ~ ~ armenia ~ ~ azerbaijan . 
  inhabited by armenians , i think . 
  your flag is cool . 
  even some of the people living there are cool too , your politicians instead ... are like our own : /, 
  of course you like it , sneaky english . . they find a way to put that flair even there ... 
  unfortunately we have the african flag . . romania vs. chad , they even sued us for god sake !, 
  do n't push your luck mate . . hmmm :p, 
  banning short skirts ?!, 
  be serious , i know germany is kinda . . meh those days , but that 's way too much !, 
  how many ? 
  they are `` historical '' minority or . . ? 
  those five minutes are a big fu to everyone and everything we ( you and me and everyone in europe ) stand for !, 
  it 's insane and insulting for our culture !, 
  edit : downvotes are n't similar with an answer !, 
  i rather build the school myself , alone !, 
  fuck his money !, 
  edit : downvote me , but i rather try that before kissing some ass only for money !, 
  does that mr. mohammad bin ... something . . bin . . gon na go to pompeii ? 
  must be a thrilling experience to see his face when he 'll see all those `` lucky '' . . hmmm things sculpted into the walls . 
  i heard that :d not to mention they have a very ugly punishment for corruption sometimes : /, 
  in one month they 'll start writing three books and have at least twelve mortal illness on square millimeter . 
  and romania accepted the bosnian and slovakian gypsies in their country because ... eastern europe shall do what we say !, 
  you know , not every roma in this world is from romania . 
  i 'm a leftist myself , i 'm kinda socialist , but i 'm not suicidal tho !, 
  i see . 
  hmmmm so , if we go back ( in time ) to my first comment ... you 're not a gentleman and ( if you are ) a french , if you do n't admit i was , more or less , right !, 
  well , except france who integrate them just fine  but they 're still mens de voyage or something . 
  it was stopped ? 
  honestly i was a kid when they started deporting them , but i still remember that some ex-yugo families ( i think from bosnia ) were shipped to romania . . ( i must ask my brother if it 's true though , he worked there then ) . 
  as a matter of fact , yes !, 
  i usually go to ireland by land since i hate flying  they have some nice caravan cars , mostly white and mercedes/renault and vw is their cars . 
  sow them twice only , so i may be way of tho . 
  it was just a joke . 
  just how much brain you need be an idiot ? 
  muslims are not necessarily bad , just like christianity is n't all flowers , got turkish friends irl who are just like me . 
  unfortunately what 's wrong with the actual trend is that we do n't know when it gon na end and how much of them gon na be here ( as in quota and things like that ) . 
  integration wo n't happen , not in western europe at least , they think about them quite bad ( men are women like . . ) , but here if they 'll be somehow made to stay , they will be integrated ... those four or five of them :d, 
  i have no idea how much is the tax but i know i 've paid 1.55 $ per litre . 
  and since we have , supposedly , oil we should probably pay a little less . 
  how much is there ? 
  in euros please :p, 
  less ? 
  we even have oil and we still pay more than almost anyone else in europe !, 
  i reckon i may be wrong tho . . 
  i have a crazy idea , every would-be candidates for a political position should live at least two years in a ghetto !, 
  or four in prison . 
  bet my ass they 'll think different in one week at most . 
  hmmmm , regarding your video . . wild bears are not really my cup of tea !, 
  we have way too many and they are quite dangerous ( i know a shepherd who eat only vegetables because of bears , horrible thing ) !, 
  * if you say anything in romanian or hungarian , anything at all , you 'll be loved !, 
  just do n't say it to the wrong people ( it 's like belgium in a way ) :d tourist are as much of an attraction for locals as horse and carts are for tourists , you 'll be welcomed in almost every place and by any person . 
  ( just came back from albania , i had the same fears and i was so pleasingly surprised ) . 
  * in the countryside ... ?!, 
  it 's not somalia here , we even have money . . our own money . . jesus christ !, 
  * not on the country , in the cities . . sometimes even kids can cope what you say . 
  use your french . . :p * you can rent a car . 
  i know in belgium there 's no such thing but you 'll learn here , i guess . 
  * like 90 % less than in brussels and i talk about bucharest here , in the country you must be very very very unlucky to even have the `` chance '' to see how an attempt it is ( in a village they 'll just jump in the robber 's head in no time , in my region at least ) . 
  nor is nigeria or congo , but most of them black guys do n't call for sharia4 . .
