  i need a king here mate : ^ p, 
  ive heard but i do n't want to see things like that . . especially since i 'll be in mexico in february !, 
  i do n't want to compare anything with anything when anything living thing is murdered ... !!!, 
  animals included !, 
  i never watch anything die . . except in movies . . but those titles kinda make me put my head down by my self !, 
  when i 'll see a pic i 'll give my opinion . 
  until then ...

  i 'm only 19 my friend and i live on their money . . and i mostly study or stay here on reddit . . so , i ca n't really say them anything . 
  since they do n't force me to do anything , except study sometimes . 
   we 're not exactly peasant here, 
  do n't make me lose my hope to see a * damn * * sexy * king on our continent !, 
  say anything you want about spain but until sweden wo n't change the actual king with that * yummy * prince , they have the best looking monarch by far !, 
  i do n't even feel like commenting here !, 
  it 's so sad and it makes me so angry that i better stay away !, 
  by the way , thanks for those links / u/lolaruns, 
  shhhhh !!!, 
  say central for god sake otherwise you 're dead !!!!, 
  absolutely , every painting in europe was `` whitewashed '' since every king and noble in europe was black who ruled over the white slaves !, 
  but the white slaves somehow find a way to enslave the blacks from africa ( i mean that 's insulting for the real african slaves ) and somehow all these black nobles disappeared when photography was invented ( it 's not explained how though ) . 
  not to mention that he has a fetish for the ( of course ) black jane austen and her books about black english upper-middle class !, 
  what 's a little annoying is that even if romans were black and celts were black that damn julius caesar was white because . . of course . . he massacred the black celts !, 
  fortunately he 's a joke . 
  unfortunately is that american guy , i forgot his name . . he 's dead now , who 's theory about some native-american civilization from mexico and that they were in fact black ( based on some statues ) has some support in some american unis and those people are in existence even today . 
  that 's stealing their history and calling them frauds . 
  nothing can compete !, 
  i 'd rather see some isis videos than read those titles again !, 
  ewww, 
  ive read only the titles and i had to go outside for some fresh air !, 
  : / and is cold outside !!!!!, 
  if he 's right all the nobel prizes ever for everything from history to chemistry to literature from all times wo n't be enough for such a genius !, 
  some american afrocentrics gon na have a huge orgasm when they 'll see that :d edit : okay okay . . even some european afrocentrists will have it !, 
  egmond codfried comes to mind ahahaha, 
  if he would had punched some faces last time when he was in our parliament ( especially the one of the senat president ) i would n't mind if he 'll play decebal , trajan , attila , vlad dracula , \u00c1rp\u00e1d , michael the brave and mathias corvin characters in one movie !, 
  damn , i 'll even pay him to play in that movie lolol, 
  yay !!!, 
  we have a winner !, 
  we have some land indeed . 
  mostly my grandparents ( from both sides ) since my parents have have other things to take care about but we help sometimes . 
  i hate it too !, 
  i even get sick ( muscular fever and then a huge flu ) after two days of picking plums for that stupid p\u00e1link\u00e1 !!!!, 
  but at least i did it to myself since nobody 's forcing me to do it .
