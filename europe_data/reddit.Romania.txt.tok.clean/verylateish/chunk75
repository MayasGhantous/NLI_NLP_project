  and , neither so are irish people , for me at least . 
  you argue against what then ? 
  cos from what i understand you praise nationalism and i only explained that nationalism can be complicated in some remote corners of europe . 
  i 'm not exactly a good english writer/speaker , so maybe it 's my fault . 
  no it 's not . 
  it may be a part of it , but it is not eastern europe . 
  nice . . one, 
  it 's not about that , i have cold places very close to where i live . 
  it 's just the unknown , i guess . 
  * papist *, 
  and you live in central europe while the baltics are north european . 
  please !, 
  have you ever been in the balkans ? 
  what define us and why ? 
  genuine question . 
  yes but surrounding area and pacific ocean is something i dreamt about since i was 10 . 
  coming back from krakow i see :p ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  no , he 's right . 
  petropavlovsk kamtchaski it is . 
  being a european is how i 'm proud about both !, 
  as a nationalist i 'll be bound to hate the other part by default . 
  i 'm not an immigrant , i was born here and so were all of my ancestors . 
  that 's the problem most of * nationalists * have in many countries on the continent , they are n't sure if hating their old ( as in historical ) minorities is the game for winning votes or the new minorities hahaha so if i just gon na move there only cos i like the weather in bundoran ? 
  what about that ? 
  out with me ? 
  hahahahaha that 's a good one !, 
  you could have said . . nice , the city/town/resort !, 
  i thought you said * nice *, 
  and that 's eastern europe ? 
  it 's like mexico is at fault for isis 's hummers and tanks . 
  now i really do n't understand you !, 
  please explain !, 
  no it 's not !!!!, 
  eastern europe is made by more than one country !, 
  i live in one and it 's defo not russia . 
  i do n't understand . 
  i said something wrong ? 
  i know . 
  i was wondering if our irish friend know that too, 
  how can i be proud of romania 's accomplishments when i 'm hungarian ? 
  how can i be proud of hungary 's accomplishments when i live in romania ? 
  okay , i get what you said but maybe some other words should 've been used . 
  by the way , if i 'll get married with my fiancee , who 's irish , it 'll be a multicultural thing , no ? 
  have an upvote anyways , for not being a dick , 
  because you sound like their countries are some sort of monoculture strongholds or something . 
  where 'd you live ? 
  maybe we can exchange clowns, 
  are you aware about baltic states demographic figures ? 
  since when that 's required ?!, 
  i do n't have anything to do with my country 's accomplishments or wrongdoings anyway . 
  i do n't even belong to the ethnic group this country took its name from . 
  so i should be ashamed of myself or something , or be less proud of what i am ? 
  lot 's of exotic places are a part of france . 
  tahiti is one of those places i want to see as long i 'm young . 
  yeah , i 've seen your * complicated * flair but i did n't look up to see what it is about . . 
  i 'll do that now  edit : marseillais ? 
  oh c'mon , you 're just showing of about your empire now !, 
  yes you do know how . 
  i guess i 'll try it next year . 
  well , this is a nice gesture indeed . 
  people like this kind of things here in reddit . 
  :d i 'm sure , just like anyone with a little brain , that 's just a guy/girl/party who stopped by a creek ( look at the trees in the background ) and made a pic . 
  or something like that . 
  pics please :p maybe next time i 'll try to see some of your beaches , last year i only see your mountains and capital city . 
  but you know that already , 
  you forgot your beaches and excellent mountain roads , 
  it said there in the title `` in your country '' , so / u/ohran is from/live in tahiti . 
  who knows , 
  petropavlovsk and the surroundings , now that 's something i want to see before i die . 
  try transf\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015fan in the winter . . for the * thrills * ^ ^ ^ ^ / s or \u021aara oa\u015fului / avass\u00e1g ( that heathen from carei forgot about us ) on christmas time . 
  take something for hangover with you though , since `` tur\u021b \u021buic\u0103 '' abuse is for conoseurs only . . and you 'll have lots of * abuse * shoved down your throat, 
  get out of here !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s even now i have nightmares about those movies ughh !!, 
  that 's a very strange pic indeed . 
  definitely the owner does n't live there . 
  hell , looking at the missing window and the unkempt grass makes me think nobody lives there . 
  on the other hand it 's connected to electricity and the roof * suffered * some sort of fixing attempt , so ... hmmmm my first thought was that 's some kind of stable , now i 'm not sure what to belive . 
  i remember him now . 
  thanks , 
  i 've heard about him here on reddit ( from one of your posts , if i 'm not mistaking ) . 
  i 'll look up for him . 
  and you said you 're on the opposite side ... of the danube maybe . 
  ** we ** ** are ** ** the ** ** wrong ** ** people ** ** !, 
  that 's so * us * hahaha yeah , low pay check make you do worse unfortunately . 
  life imprisonment , no parole , will change some minds there . 
  we had one who got 30 years , only to stay 15 there , since he 's older than 60 . 
  do n't swear !, 
  are n't the judges immune from anything ? 
  burn them !!!, 
  i 'll definitely gon na be banned for this from some subs . 
  maybe , i 'm not sure about it though . 
  i know dna people from my county and from prahova and all of them are 30-ish . 
  interesting , i never heard about that . 
  the guy we investigate is not our first banker anyways , not even the second imo . 
  edit : for the downvoter , adrian vasilescu is the second one imo . 
  yeah i got it now . 
  it said something about our country 's evolution though and how easy many of us could go back in time , mentality wise . 
  nobody can * fix * the political system , all we can do is change our mentality and make stealing from the * state * * - * * people * something shameful . 
  but i do n't have much hopes . 
  why ?
