  back in the mediaeval day , not yesterday . 
  in case of war , of course . 
  otherwise , that piece of land can do its kaliningradic things for all i , and the rest of the world , cares . 
  absolutely !, 
  what i 've tried to say is that if something closely similar would happen here the backslash would be against all muslims . . especially in the little towns . 
  my opinion though , so take it with a train filled with salt , 
  and i 'm staying here in my little village in eastern europe and ca n't believe my eyes : / if ** one ** would be arrested in bucharest , or anywhere here , for planning such things ... would be a big backslash alover the country . 
  belgium seems cool with that . 
  let 's just kill people to please . . 
  what ?!, 
  kinda off topic . 
  i remember my very racist grand-gramma who said after brussels terrorist attacks `` are they crazy ? 
  how would allah would want that ?! '', 
  and she 's very anti muslim ... :d, 
  and i thought he 's italian . . paolo . 
  jpaolo m. . fudjees , john paul . . the pope !, 
  you 're just like them . 
  ca n't believe you were buddy-buddy with those over-emotional poles back in the day . 
  yeah right , like anyone gon na invade that place lithuania or poland are such a menace to russia ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  `` the nato '' ** is ** those eastern european countries . 
  russia do its military exercises on its territory and nato do its military exercises on its territory . 
  i really do n't see where 's the problem !, 
  baltics are beyond this , their emotions are just . . not there, 
  yes , the sith has more emotions than you guys : ^ p edit : that 's a joke by the way !, 
  at least is not for girls , yet !, 
  i think the article is right about men having a little problem there .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ outta ^ ^ ^ ^ here ^ ^ ^ ^ cos ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ face ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ red ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ boiled ^ ^ ^ ^ crab ^ ^ ^ ^ !, 
  oh , i know that . 
  mine too ( brothers and father ) unfortunately,

  i do n't know if to laugh or cry : /, 
  iss suchs simples languagesis justs likeses yours . . s ^ ^ / s : ^ ), 
  i do n't know , could be , but theirs gymnastics and hockey teams were great . 
  and i do n't think those girls from the gymnastic team used drugs , would kill them . . but i 'm not exactly an expert .

  i live in a house made of the same glass and only cos i live here does n't made me immune to this `` throwing stones '' desease my friend . 
  i think your answer was not nice even if you as a person are \u263a, 
  it was a joke my catholic friend  edit : fuck you too , downvoters !,
