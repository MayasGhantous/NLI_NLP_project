  german swiss ? 
  ... ca n't escape it, 
  ** finally ** ** a ** ** good ** ** thing ** ** !, 
  second one !!!!!!!!, 
  shut up !, 
  never heard about that place in \u00c1rad county . 
  yeeeeesss !!!!!, 
  then they should avoid all those idiotic fights and riots in france !, 
  1848 - b\u00e9szt day of liv ^ ^ 1 ^ ^ 8 ^ ^ 4 ^ ^ 9 ^ ^ cri ^ ^ evri ^ ^ tiem ^ ^, 
  ** edit : austrians are here with their downvotes edit 2 : take that downvoters * 2 * * - * * 0 *, 
  pay them 100 $ and send those idiots home ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i would n't go alone . . if i 'll ever go there , or in any religious country !, 
  thank you , by the way !!, 
  hellenised . 
  you 're right i 'm one of those fractions and i love this country !, 
  it 's just absolutely bullocks to force somebody to became you . 
  it 's stupid and makes you loose half of your county ... if you know what i mean : /, 
  tell me about it . . : /, 
  are you sure they did n't ? 
  not that integration ( aka assimilation ) is something good . 
  i 'm hungarian , should i became romanian to be a `` good citizen '' of my country ? 
  and no , those greeks from anatolia are helenised natives , just like my ancestors were n't magyars originally . 
  no , we 're quite alright financially . 
  it 's just . . 
  i ca n't cope with idiocy and that 's one of them . 
  i mean , come here guys but do n't wear shorts if you 're a woman and drink only in your hotel/chamber . . rwanda is better . 
  same here , romania is a nation state . 
  they came and settle ... maybe they did but 2000 years ago . 
  they 're as much foreign and invadors as greeks from anatolia are ? 
  i 'm not romanian , ethnically speaking , i live here and my ancestors lived here since 900ac at least , so my grudge has nothing to do with romanians or romania but with minorities . 
  looks like i must stay put then , or ask my dad to sell the house lololol, 
  first time in my life when i said such thing, 
  what you said does n't sound good for my ears as a minority in my country . 
  only extremists say such things here . 
  just my opinion , i 've no feud with greece or albania . 
  i guess i 'm white but i 'm a woman , can i do that ? 
  ignorats believe today 's isis = islam back in the days . 
  using same scale i should hate catholics guys for burning my evangelical kin !, 
  exactly !, 
   even by medieval european standards yeah right !, 
  burning innocent women and impaling `` turks '' was such a civil thing ^ ^ / s i do n't say they were wrong impaling though . . lololol, 
  this caesar had a good thing with cleo though , up until he was kiled by `` nationalists '' , 
  ** in ** ** march ** ? 
  and we hear about it in june ?!? 
  i 'm with you tonight against england , even if i hate your politicians !, 
  nobody 's hate you guys , most of us hate your imperial ( i 'm bigger/stronger than you so i can fk you whenever i want ) politics , that 's all . 
  there 's no interethnic tensions here , unfortunately nationalists from hungary and southern romania try to push their crap down our throats . 
  edit : not everyone from there are like that . 
  finland stole lots of s #t from others . . ** not ** !, 
  but i think you 're not exactly wrong though . 
  imagine how much we could steal being united ^ ^ / s, 
  it could be as you say , fortunately ( or unfortunately , for us ) communism has as much to do with a welfare state as nationalism with people wellbeing . 
  my parents lived in both here in romania back in the 80s, 
  of course you ca n't after only 700 years ... we 're here since 1200 years ( even if i think we 're mostly locals in fact ) and still new here according to some people, 
  yes he does n't say that , but europe is n't only a handful of european countries who stole from their colonies ... 
  i may do that but everything has a start . 
  nationalism 's children are fanaticism and fascism unfortunately . 
  nationalism is not the answer !, 
  i 'm european and i belong to a minority in my country . 
  nationalism , from the majority here and from my own ethnic group is something i abhorred since i was born because it 's dangerous and a threatening menace for my good life . 
  i 'd just put them in jail , all of them . 
  and every one should be put with two eastern europeans inmates and three arab/north african / muslim ones . 
  there would be the ultimate fun, 
  yeah right , everyone in europe back in the day were slave owners who took everything from other people . 
  no european was ever exploited by non-europeans ever . . 
  please . . 
   . . you remember with tears of joy how the bashibozuk . . 
  very surprised to find out / r/europe has / u/losangelesturk as a member !, 
  since he 's at least 200 + years old and has tears of joy in his old eyes while he remember those bashbouzouk killings in his youth / s, 
  hmmm so i , as a romanian magyar , can have my cultural autonomy but a turk in bulgaria can not ? 
  why ? 
  yeah , what a hell is wrong with these people ? 
  do that , or else ... 
  hehehe upvoted , 
  put some `` superior than ya '' behavior on the net there . . 
  `` asylum seekers in sweden who commit any kind of crime will be sent in romania and bulgaria the next day '' ... `` locals in both eastern european countries celebrate the news , north of the danube szeklers fraternity with romanians reached the highest peak , lots of them cut big branches from trees chanting some song and for some unknown reason sharping one end of them . 
  both nationalities forgot about their hate for eachother ... must be a miracle '' that 's a better clickbait than this . 
  that `` some '' country is in europe , it kinda is 1/4 of europe . 
  so they 're already here . 
  with their good and bad they 're one of us . 
  edit : downvotes wo n't change that . 
  and trust me guys , i 'm so far from a russia lover as it gets . 
  i know it kinda is hahaha, 
  there there , poor / u/xnicolex , 
  same thing here . 
  thumbs up / u/bristlerider . 
  i used to like rain and clouds , not so much anymore :(, 
  and those people will be absolutely right . 
  words ca n't express how stupid this is !, 
  look up for chechen wars . 
  on / r/europe ? 
  you need new glasses my friend !, 
  yes i was wrong , sorry !, 
  just as you were when you assumed `` decent '' one 's do `` exclusively illegal work '' . 
  i 'd mock the hell out of your shoes master , but i do n't know where you live , spain or germany . . 
  so long master , let 's hope our laser swords wo n't meet ... 
  okay i 'm quite ignorant about star wars, 
  the `` there '' i 've heard about - never been unfortunately . 
  the `` this '' sounds like something i heard before but ca n't remember where , that before looking up for the band  edit : so . . you 're ~ 45 ? 
  you definitely said it in your first post before i replied .
