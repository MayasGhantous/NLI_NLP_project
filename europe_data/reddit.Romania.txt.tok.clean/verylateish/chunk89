  `` best weapons eva ' , ask ukraine ! '', 
  call now russiantourists123, 
  i 'll absolutely be a fine * dad * . 
  okay , now this is the most stupid thing i 've ever heard . 
  nah , they have other abrahamic religion to f. . k with . 
  who needs hospitals when ** god ** is with you ?!? 
  and since he 's with you and he kinda is a big guy , we must build a house for him . 
  ^ / s ugghhhh, 
  not exactly . 
  made a roof of skin ... korwin 's skin !, 
  it 's ** up ** per hungary of course . 
  i ca n't see my village . 
  damn !, 
  there 's a mountain range there . 
  a big one . 
  well , you guys were n't exactly genocidal against jews . 
  you had your faults but that 's not one of them . 
  at least that 's what i know . 
  we all were idiots back then . 
  populism and poor education can do that unfortunately . 
  denmark and netherlands are different countries . 
  those countries do n't even share a border . 
  ** good !, 
  prepare yourself for some jungle office ya damn monkey !, 
  thank you !, 
  \u2661 e : it 's for all magyars not only for hungary !, 
  cesspool ; / r/romania please refrain the `` wtf '' use with me . 
  use hell instead . 
  how 's bavaria by the way ? 
  absolutely . 
  i 'm breathing superiority !, 
  you being insane ? 
  it 's clearly possible since you 're a catholic . 
  excellent description !!!, 
  are you insane ? 
  vojvodina is a part of banat . 
  i think the entire banat was one of the most ( historically ) diverse place in europe . 
  hungarians , romanians , serbians , croatians , slovaks , ukrainians , bulgarians , germans etc. . . and it still kinda is . 
  a very interesting place . 
  unfortunately ( fortunately ? ), 
  we have bad relations only with eachother . 
  the slavic nations who surround us are all right for us ... except for slovakia sometimes . 
  this is not true . 
  they never insulted hungary or hungarians from romania for being hungarians . 
  i should know that do n't you think ? 
  well ... it kinda has . 
  the revolution took place in transylvania too . 
   surrounded by slavs there 's some ~ ~ germans ~ ~ germanic people in the western part though . 
  thank you !, 
  i know now . 
  yes . 
  i understand that now . 
  they respected him too much even . 
  yup . 
  i got it now . 
  c'mon , even you can see i just pokin ' you !, 
  really ?!, 
  i 'm sure even you can see how turkish/azerbaijani this sounds . 
  edit : your flair is kinda trollish . 
  russia ** needs ** ?!? 
  oh ... all right !, 
  never . 
  they have their own personal weapons . 
  i have both brothers in the army and even if they are n't like those guys , they 've seen how it is . 
  be serious . 
  they can explore territorial expansion in non-turkish lands in syria but even there is kinda * ugh * for them . 
  in the north would be complete suicide without russia 's help . 
  are you even seriously asking this question !? 
  it 's a troll . 
  congratulations for living such wonderful times !, 
  nobody is sane in that region . 
  cyprus is close by but they have problems too . 
  it 's only turkey 's prez who think is a good thing to play s\u00fcleyman the magnificent game unfortunately . 
  especially since tzar putin and bigly emperor trump is like him , poor europe can suck it or die in his * majestic * opinion . 
  if an american official , let 's say pence , comes to your country . 
  do you think he gon na came without armed `` bodyguards '' ?!, 
  lol even our officials have those . 
  pushovers ?!, 
  not with us . 
  the monkey poet name translated in english . 
  now i wait a serbian user to say the family name . 
  albania is orange serbia is green . 
  nothing is written only op knows what it means . 
  i guess you belive this . 
  well , it may suck to live in a corrupt country but it definitely suck to be seen more corrupt than you really are , especially when at least two schengen countries are worse than you . 
  but with them eu will stay as good as it is but with us no . 
  i get it mate , i kinda know it since i was born . 
  and that 's why we 'll love multi-speed eu , at least we gon na officially become what we are de facto . 
  i 've heard something about caucasian languages , so i was n't totally wrong at least . 
  yes . 
  i wo n't explain it since honestly i 've no idea why you deny our access in schengen . 
  i guess it 's because you think a 1 second stop at the hungarian border ( if even that ) will stop us from exiting the country or something . 
  and i guess populism must be fed from time to time too . 
  k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m my friend from the future !, 
  looks like those pesky dutchies finally go under water . 
  it took them quite a long time i must admit . 
  well ... better late than never . 
  at least we 'll die fully european now lololol, 
  ilyrian languages were i.e. 
  languages , related ( if not quite the same ) with thracian languages .
