  albanian is belived to be their sole * descendant * . 
  i 've read something about a relation with some caucasians languages ( georgian ?!? ), 
  but i guess it 's not a very reliable theory . 
  yes , but we 'll have augustus instead . 
  let the americans have caesar . 
  that 's why i kinda start to appreciate even our politicians . 
  at least a prime-minister never said something so stupid from a historical point of view in a looooong time here . 
  then no impaling for you dracula !, 
  now go back in your coffin !, 
  so ... where 's the netherlands in all this ? 
  what war ?!, 
  independence from whom ? 
  edit : sometimes , even if i hate them , i think our politicians are quite sane in comparison with politicians from ( now ) most countries in the world . 
  well , we never had drunkards * in office except basescu ... which your prez visited hahaha ( they must 've had a hell of a time together lol ) but he never looked drunk in public . 
  * we had crazy types like ceausescu or the iron guard though . 
  i know . 
  i just answered to what / u/zombiepiratefrspace said about how we could be cautiously optimistic . 
  i 'm not and almost nobody here is about these things . 
  we already know we are 2nd class eu citizens and in a multi-speed eu we 'll definitely gon na be in the last speed ( almost non-eu ) no matter what we 'll want . 
  honestly this is a good way for transforming a very pro eu country in something else unfortunately . 
  you can * blow * some people before * impaling * though . 
  thank you !, 
  it would be quite a shame to have somebody as a head of state like the `` personalities '' you named . 
  nobody in eu has such politicians in charge yet . 
  edit : i remember one czech prez was ... let 's say hmmm not exactly sober some years ago when he was in romania . 
  i was very young back then and i forgot the year and if it 's the same guy you have now though but he was obviously drunk . 
  unfortunately our prez back then was a former ship captain and i guess they had a drinking contest or something . 
  username checking out . 
  if it 's not ruled by a sultan , tzar or habsburg i 'm all for it !, 
  absolutely !, 
  we are still very optimistic about schengen too . ^ ^ / s, 
  not that czech prez is very enthusiastic either from what i 've heard ( or is the former one ?!, 
  i assume that user is talking about states . 
  at least somebody did it . 
  life imprisonment is way too small of a punishment for rape !, 
  e : i 'm biased since i was almost a victim . 
  well . . volcanoes kind of throwing rocks out of them . 
  wallachia too :d, 
  we are many !, 
  i really do n't care !, 
  i was just curious since your message was kinda ... too much . 
  i 'm sorry if i sounded l like that !, 
  i never intended to sound like that . 
  it migh be my poor english fault ... 
  i 'm sorry for it . 
   so . . `` shtokavian '' is in fact the official language in croatia and serbia ? 
  ** finally ** this is the movie !, 
  well . . mini-whatever !, 
  thank you very much !!!, 
  e : yeeeeesssssss i finally can sleep !, 
  damn movie , i love it !, 
  where have you been ( if you can say of course ) ? 
  the region/county is enough . 
  it 's not like italian is understandable for my grandma either haha pointy yugoslav nose and tanned ? 
  very hand-talking ? 
  ** that 's ** ** it ** ... or maybe you had a car with italian plates !, 
  i know that . 
  whenever my mum is asked why she 's so white , she answer `` i 'm hungarian '' ( which is true for all my family ) and i say i was stolen from my real family ( my bf irish mum belive it for two days ... stupid old bitch ! ) . 
  do n't worry . 
  soon you 'll see that in some study romania is closer to iraq ( only god knows how ) and two users ( more like one with two acc ) will use it in a thread to bash this country ... while accusing it of islamophobia . 
  that 's not so amazing in europe unfortunately . 
  every language has * traces * from many different languages . 
  i barely can understand some written spanish but i can cope very well with even spoken italian . 
  upvoted for the french :d, 
  off topic !, 
  pleaseeeee tell me the name of that catalan movie where a. . . kinda robin hood guy with a long black hair revolted against spanish governor ... the guy who hunt him was a bald guy !, 
  i forgot the name of that damn movie !, 
  e : when i 've seen that movie i thought is in romanian and i could n't understand why they translate it ... even though i also did n't understood what they said . 
  lol, 
  romanian ?!? 
  i thought you guys do n't exactly understand romanian at all . 
  hmm ... til, 
  can a croat peasant who live close to slovenia understand ( or kinda understand ) a serbian peasant from timok valley ( or kosovo ) if they meet in a. . . 
  i do n't know . . train compartment ? 
  i 'm very curious !, 
  very well said !, 
  wow !, 
  finns talk latin just like a swede or norwegian would !, 
  it 's something there which reminds me about those languages lol now ... this * type * of latin sounds less dry but still dry-ish . 
  i 'm sure back then romans had ... 
  i do n't know , more colour in their speech . 
  at least it does n't sound like vatican latin , that type would dry sahara . 
  edit : i understand what is written there in the same measure as i understand written aromanian ... more or less 60-70 % . 
  absolutely . 
  for me latin sounds ... ** dry ** for some reason . 
  i guess it 's because we do n't exactly know how it was really spoken . 
  well that 's a language i 'll never be able to learn . 
  are you okay in the head ? 
  they were same . 
  same lagers and same idiocy only with a different cloth . 
  fuck them both !, 
  good !, 
  put everyone in europe in this box genetically ... kinda lol . 
  or just out them almost all by language . 
  what a little bulb is my region :d, 
  in what region and century ? 
  edit : yes ... your downvotes would surely change my mind about my reality . 
  smart !, 
  ughh, 
  after two days of plum picking for my family this autumn i was sick one week .
