  i do n't think the rest of the people who did that for almost two weeks need any kind of `` exercise '' after it . 
  i confused catalan with romanian for at least 5 minutes when i stumbled upon a catalan movie on tv . 
  it was my first encounter with that fabulous language lol . 
  this !, 
  nobody ever think about that . 
  it 's only romanian is heavily influenced by slavic languages but never italian , french etc are influenced by germanic ones , or spanish and portuguese by germanic and arabic . 
  they do n't like girls . 
  they 're into games mostly ... video games : /, 
  is he ... has it ? 
  well ... hmmmmmmm, 
  maybe he 's a metrosexual dog who loves his * silhouette * . 
  :d edit : ** i ** ** just ** ** love ** ** that ** ** smile **, 
  i 'm sorry if my comments are out of touch or offensive !, 
  a forum is a place where different people express their different opinions . . good ones or wrong ones . . about different things . 
  some of those opinions may be wrong and some are spot on . 
  you think my opinion is wrong . 
  i can live with that , 
  aaaaawwwwwww what a face \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 he looks like he 's laughing even ( it 's a he ... 
  i can see the * cough * ) god !, 
  he also look like my dog would n't be enough of a meal for him either hahahaha, 
  i think i 'll keep my sweet flair  : * ya dog, 
  definitely what i said did n't sounds right ... but what you said sounds even worse . 
  do ... what ? 
  i want your flair !, 
  how can i get it ? 
  we are a politicall continent ... so * mod * accordingly . 
  in rs ? 
  true * mici * are made out of pork . 
  i live in romania . 
  thank you !, 
  i have no idea what that is but we always were just fine here . 
  `` i do n't know or care '' . . my generation 's answer !, 
  avoid your generation mistakes . 
  have some understanding for serbs or muslims . 
  and so they should have for you !, 
  and all of you for us hahaha :d, 
  i 'll sue a serb in no time and since i have internet i 'll sue the judge too if he 's an idiot !, 
  if you have problems p.m. !, 
  do you really need to call names on people ? 
  hahaha it 's because i kinda know albania ( i love it ) and i guess you felt some need to insult me ... especially since you live in the west ( ? 
  i understand you ... 
  i 'm from a minority too . 
  i just say that if someone oppressed someone else on any kind of base there it can be filmed these days . 
  does n't it ? 
  no , what you 're talking about is another nation 's interference in a sovereign nation business . 
  if you do that serbia will do it and we gon na have a war . 
  let 's avoid it , 
  it 's not nice to downvote me while we talk  look up and see what we 're talking about my albanian friend , 
  who 's oppressive on who ? 
  there 's eu law and internet and phone cameras . 
  everyone can just film or record an abuse . 
  i doubt a war is a good thing for anyone . 
  edit : thank you for your downvote ( whoever you are ) !, 
  war is absolutely a good thing . 
  are you pleased now ? 
  talk to eachother . 
  it 's the only solid solution . 
  war gains are only temporary . 
  a reaction will always cause a counter reaction . 
  and so on and so forth and ... . until we have another war were people die and party leaders have a sun bath in ibiza . 
  serbian and croatian and sometimes bosniak leaders are hand in hand to milk you dry and make you kill eachother only for profit !, 
  oh but you 're wrong ... russia would love a war there . 
  it 's something which will made people look away from their craps in ukraine and syria ... and a little debauchery is good . 
  not to mention how many criminals can just die in a war instead their prisons etc etc etc edit : excellent hahahaha, 
  i said * almost * sice they are in majority there . 
  i doubt croatia would do anything without eu or nato backing . 
  hey ... 
  i 'm not some pro republika srpska fan girl here . 
  i just say how i think it will be . 
  we ai n't in the '90s are we ? 
  i really never understand that hate anyway . 
  we could cope here , hungarians and romanians and you could n't !, 
  are you sure croatia will send its army in a place where serbs live almost exclusively only to preserve another country 's existence ? 
  if so ... kudos for your courage guys !, 
  pork is necessary for us to live ... and some turkey/chicken meat for me ... , 
  i do n't think croatia will do anything if eu say no . 
  imo of course . 
  indians will be very upset on bosniaks now !, 
  me too since i do n't like cow meat at all :d edit : we really should made a thread . 
  what 's the best ... beef , pork , mixed ... etc seriously !, 
  this sound very like here . 
  unfortunately : /, 
  pork meat ? 
  ** this **, 
  in my opinion if eu will go down in the next years ( not going to ) we in the east will be at the mercy of our ex-communist kleptocracy . 
  i dunno about croatia but we do n't want that here again !, 
  what 's that ? 
  that 's why i love eu . 
  it made borders meaningless between eachother . 
  if nato or eu wo n't care . . it will be a very short war and you know it . 
  e : war not was, 
  you were n't insulted by my first statement ?!, 
  damn : ^ d i 'll do it for a day of backpacking tour since i 'm not very capable financially to stay over night ... at least not without my dad 's money lolol, 
  not another redhead ... pleaseeeeee :d, 
  do n't be . 
  the climate is worse here than there in the winter and first 2/3 of spring . 
  with few exceptions ... like today  it 's beautiful outside today !, 
  where 's mine ? 
   `` hot '' sun of march damn ... and i expect cold days of april and/or `` lamb 's snow '' . 
  greece here i come !!!,
