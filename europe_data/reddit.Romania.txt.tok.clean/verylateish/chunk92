  nothing at all . 
  except it 's so damn crowded with the world 's biggest thieves !, 
  i 'd like to visit :d, 
  well , what fell over them is a boat too and theirs look so tiny . 
  i know . 
  that 's why i respect your country a little more than some of its neighbours , 
  you are right :d, 
  well they are . . : /, 
  oh god ... you do n't want to see my cd 's from back then ... we had an obsession for domesticated birds/animals . 
  mods are always bad there . 
  :( but usually they are very kind . 
  too bad your region flair is monaco-like but you can be assumed as a very rich person in the same way . 
  until i listen the first song i thought you 're from indonesia or monaco lolol :d, 
  i 'm not aromanian !, 
  but i 'm still from a minority in romania ( the second hated one hahahaha ) . 
  now i see that even your username is ... 
  first one is spot on for what we had back then . 
  the second one not so much unfortunately since i live in the countryside . 
  yes me . 
  and if you 're so hateful against anything greek then talk to a rock and avoid looking in the mirror . 
  it 's a european language which is dying !, 
  in school ?!, 
  damn we sang only stupid songs in school !, 
  ... not that 's a very bright song either but still ... e : poland in reverse ? 
  it stil is but not there, 
  that 's because they are ... not born here though hahahaha, 
  i was 6 yo and absolutely in love of them all . 
  rip those two guys in that little thingy . 
  i 'm not into money and * game * is a must for us too sometimes . 
  not to mention that some of us like an older guy . 
  not only you have fantasies hahaha edit : * you * as in guys of course . 
  best ship ever for me !, 
  for my seasick and fear of deep water this is just perfect . 
  about 20 yo women and more than 30 yo men . 
  are you sure ? 
  no bamboo club anymore ... 
  i guess that 's what you 're talking about since fair hair guys are n't exactly successful here lololol, 
  both my brothers were there ... unfortunately for my mum . 
  e : unfortunately for me they 're still alive :d, 
  i know this song is n't very urban for romanians and very greek for ... well greeks . 
  but is kinda how our ancestors spoke more or less . 
  it 's a language which will be lost . 
  wikipedia says lots of not so true things unfortunately ... especially the en . 
  one !, 
  not quite . 
  majority are romanians in here . 
  i 'm not szekler by the way !, 
  it 's an ancient language and you better accept it . 
  it 's something not many of us listened and not many of us accepted it as a different language/people . 
  be open minded my friend , 
  it 's kinda ... balkan language before us !, 
  i 'm sorry romanian and greek nationals !, 
  it 's another language and it should be preserved . 
  edit : this post wo n't have much life here anyway . 
  too bad since we 're not the same anyway and in a way we are same . 
  i hate deep water but this is a gorgeous piece of art !, 
  never heard about that . 
  do you have a source ? 
  oh ... do n't worry i do n't want to know her or something . 
  i was just curious where was she from . 
  german names can be found almost everywhere in romania ( and other names too ) and most of times it only means you maybe had some distant german ( or whatever ) ancestor . 
  my family name it means literally croatian . 
  oh ... that 's kinda long ago for me . 
  i had to google what y2k means lol  where was she from ? 
  me too . 
  with my romanian i can kinda understand written italian . 
  not 100 % but i get the gist of at least 7 of 10 phrases and i never study it ... not to mention romanian is n't even my mother tongue . 
  of course but it does n't mean hungarian has n't borrowed words from other languages and viceversa . 
  indeed . 
  especially since the connection with hu , ukr , bul , srb are known while the alb connection is only a guessing exercise . 
  i do n't have one on my phone . 
  i must ask my brother when i 'll be back home . 
  in three days i 'll be back . 
  remember me in 3 days  edit : please remember me in 3 days !, 
  i swear i have no pic with him !, 
  i 'm not and ... 
  i 'm stupid no ? 
  he 's a guy . 
  :d edit : i 'm sorry . . 
  i assumed you 're ... 
  i was in the north last time . 
  but i was n't too much in contact with people ... except that gorgeous guide !, 
  :d now our guide is an old man unfortunately : /, 
  first time in south . 
  yes , 
  i 'm in albania now and i ca n't make a difference between ** r ** 's at all . 
  it sounds the same for me . 
  i guess devils like it too then . 
  albanian is quite wierd for my ears , especially with that english-like ** r ** . 
  this !!!, 
  at least hun and rom have a lot of connection here . 
  same with hun/rom and ger and slavic languages . 
  feck you :d, 
  yes . 
  i wish we have such problems here . 
  and pineapple on pizza is good . 
  italians please do n't kill me !, 
  that 's because we are . 
  nah ... we do n't exactly care about him anyway . 
  i live in the countryside and in romania !,
