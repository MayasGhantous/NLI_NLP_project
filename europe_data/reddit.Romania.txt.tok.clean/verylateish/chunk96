  look better . 
  e : not to mention they stayed there even now . 
  same like us . 
  not like other bigger and richer countries . 
  we in the east took it seriously and what that guy said affect us way more than our western cousins . 
  that guy 's statement play exactly the russian game and some of you ca n't even see that . 
  since when kosovo is in romania/transylvania ?!, 
  is iran same as israel ? 
  as a matter of fact our soldiers were in kosovo and bosnia too and even in albania back in the '90s . 
  then do n't defend the moderation of commitment because that 's exactly what russia wants . 
  and still poland was one of the biggest men provider in both those wars . 
  my brothers were under polish command two times in afghanistan . 
  neither we were when we fought for you in iraq !, 
  commitment for what ?!, 
  in korea it was against communists ( usa vs ussr/china ) , kuwait it was for oil and saudi arabia ( ca n't understand why iran is an enemy but ksa is an ally ) , balkans ... it 's a shame how late nato intervention took place in bosnia and what stupid bombing took place over serbia ( and even then we , a non-nato country helped america against the best neighbouring country we had ) . 
  and since even we , a non-nato member back then , lost people there and since this year we 're at 2 % for defence i expect to be defended if shit hit the fan around here . 
  why should we start a war ?!, 
  we fought in your wars for the single reason to be protected from a war if it gon na be the case . 
  but so did georgia and look how good they are now . 
  not my country . 
  and we were n't even a nato member back then . 
  baltics were in afghanistan my friend !, 
  the problem with afghanistan is that we were n't even a nato member and we still participated . 
  in iraq too . 
  and now what we get , trump 's bullshit and the middle finger ? 
  in what war provoked by my country american soldiers died since we are in nato ?!, 
  in what war defending my country american soldiers died since we are in nato ? 
  the answer is zero !, 
  we died in your wars ( if you 're american ) not the other way round . 
  so what now ? 
  finally a eu army or not ? 
  by the way , as a sister of two soldiers who were in afghanistan and iraq i 'm curious if mr trump 's country would do the same sacrifice our country and my family did for his country . 
  because our soldiers were sent there with a reason and it was n't for fun , it was for securing our country 's security when/if time comes . 
  e : and yes we know security is not for free , that 's why we lost men and women in your war against terror !, 
  awwww poor little puppy !, 
  you are so strong !, 
  constan\u021ba is not in wallachia tho . 
   it is in dobrogea/dobruja ... or whatever the name is in english . 
  really now ? 
  okay, 
  i know how maramure\u0219 is . 
  ** this **, 
  it 's how those pensioners said lololololol :d, 
  i 'm not a man . 
  so i ignore those maps ! ^ ^ / s : ^ d, 
  how dare he wear that name ?!, 
  he does n't have anything to do with our people ( say what mate ?!, 
  ) , go back to your people ( like were you mofo 's ? ) . 
  and that was in our parliament and our party is with them too !, 
  since my family name means croat i bet my arse i have some slavic in me too . 
  i 'm a / r/europe user since more than two years and i 've never seen that thread , of course i did n't comment there and i absolutely do n't think about croatia as a fascist state !, 
  so ... generalisation , just like they did to your country . 
  my singular opinion though . 
  edit : thank you for dw 's !, 
  how can a jewish bulgarian look so white ?!, 
  it 's imposible !, 
  are you sure you 're bulgarian ? 
  no they do n't . 
  i know i do n't look slavic , from an american pov at least . 
  otherwise more than half of scandinavia would look slavic . 
  hungarians too , do n't forget !, 
  i 'll * slave * your arse for that !, 
  e : / s, 
  i doubt there 's any pensioner around . 
  they 're busy getting their 100 ron and spit on our president ... just as our * social * * democrats * order them !, 
  as a left winger i 'm completely destroyed ... politically wise . 
  no ottoman empire descendants around here . 
  the principalities were n't * turkified * , we were only tributary semi-states . 
  transylvania was even better than the other ~ ~ three ~ ~ two , or royal hungary :'( maybe that 's why nobody here hate turkey , quite the contrary to be honest . 
  how old is he ?!, 
  does he know geography and/or history ? 
  is he normal in the head ? 
  ^ ^ / s :d, 
  what 's that ? 
  it 's the other way round mate . 
  lot 's of south-eastern european blood in ottomans/turkey . 
  `` way too white '' . . `` are you sure you 're romanian ? '' . 
  hahahahaha :d, 
  op is from romania . 
  it 's ** ron ** mr. farage , ron !!, 
  ! ^ ^ / s :d, 
  turkey in europe is more for `` how to iritate american teens '' not europeans . 
  damn i do n't blame putin for those little green men . 
  north africa has lot 's of farming . 
  and no , i do n't know it from games lolol :d, 
  my land as in my own personal one , which is not mine but my father 's ... no . 
  but if you mean not used land . 
  why not ?!, 
  there 's alot of land in the green zone in my country where scotland 's national plant is abundant unfortunately , so why not put that land to good use and pay some taxes for it too ? 
  oh shut up , m\u00e1ramaros does n't have the best soil !, 
  this !!, 
  good land poor maintenance . 
  or `` foreigners gon na stole our land '' crap . 
  i live in a blue part tho . 
  : downvotes for truth ?!, 
  or for me living in the blue area ? 
  yeah ... you 're right . 
  it would n't be that bad if european alde would just distance themselves from our alde though . 
  or at least from its leader c.p. 
  that would be extremely easy .
