  the world is getting ridiculous , 
  try to buy food for them in the winter . 
  those things eat like it 's the end of the world and milk is barely seen when is cold . 
  i guess who sell it for your laptop did it to a slaughterhouse or to a guy who ... you know !, 
  i 'm a cow myself so i absolutely can be an advisor !, 
  try feed them in the winter !, 
  i 've heard . 
  and i live where the cows live ... in the countryside . 
  some people just let them go and they do the same with horses . 
  you forgot the farts , cows fart very very strong and very very smelly ughh !, 
   the rest is prefect !, 
  yes sir/m ` am !, 
  grrrrr ca n't wait to send my cowish overlordess this info !, 
  i 'm into law not math or . . god forbid . . chemistry or physics . 
  but i 'm young enough to learn . 
  thank you !, 
  i do that on that very downvoted comment . 
  but i can be a wolf if needed !, 
  i 'm very bad at physics and chemistry unfortunately . 
  bulgarian one !, 
  very very nice , very important * trump * * voice *, 
  and as an absolute cow i 'll just turn my tail and * brrrr * on ya !, 
  i just appreciate that someone who 's not from greece knows the name of a letter in greek alphabet . 
  that 's all . 
  of course it does n't have any point except appreciation for that guy/girl knowing something not many of us know . 
  that 's it . 
  well ... that 's life . 
  meaningless . 
  oh god !, 
  this is awesome !, 
  okay . . 
  i ca n't stop laughing now :d, 
  ladies and gents ... this guy/girl know greek alphabet !!!, 
  let 's give him/her the best applauds ever ^ ^ ^ ^ since ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ absolutely ^ ^ ^ ^ incapable ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ understand ^ ^ ^ ^ it . 
  no edit at all !, 
  bring it on guys !, 
  only minus 22 ? 
  here is minus 25 since two weeks ago !, 
  lol i can just imagine how a cow would dance like * zorba * !, 
  okay , that 's a `` capo d'opera '' !, 
  awww she 's so cuteeee !!!, 
  the problem is as you said it ... they 'll be back in no time , while the crooked politicians will be free to enjoy the money they stole from us . 
  enough is enough , we were stoled and lied and made fun of for way too long !, 
  they have villas in miami or on the como lake and our children die in hospitals because we lack money for medicine !, 
  fuck them !, 
  the saddest thing for me is that this protest is against socdem and alde affiliated parties which on a eu level are my favourites but here are complete rubbish !, 
  and that 's how conservatives will win more votes in eu parliament . 
  because i rather die than vote for these two parties . 
  even someone from echr gave italy as an example for us . 
  incredible !, 
   of course a hungarian ... oh . . c'mon now !, 
  it 's not even something good ... is just reality . 
  i barely understand you . 
  but . . thanks  ... 
  that 's why you downvote me ? 
  i know how turks are and i also hate our own politicians and thiefs way more than any turkish anything !, 
  i 'm sure you confuse them with your big brother/or mother who gon na intervene there . 
  keep your sticks down guys !, 
  we need turkey here . 
  so you better stay out those greek shat ... !, 
  : ^ d edit : you know what , i really am amazed by your downvotes !, 
  i say the truth for my country in that unfortunate case ... downvote away if what i 've said is offensive to anyone ... 
  looks like we 're both downvoted  i 'm not too much into any kind of games unfortunately , 
  you just backed my statement . 
  he can suck my `` virtual '' dick then !, 
  fuck him !, 
  it 's not about nato , it 's about eu . 
  if your country had a war with a eu country nato is obsolete for us and we become enemies . 
  unfortunately !, 
  awesome ?!, 
  i 'm not sure since i have no idea about wargames !, 
  i really ca n't even think about something like that between hungary and romania . 
  it would be ... stupid !, 
  with eu !, 
  and that 's how we 'll loose our best ally on the black sea . 
  : '' ( edit : why the downvotes ? 
  turkey is our best hope for a strong navy in the black sea . 
  so if what you say it will be reality . . we can say bye bye to that and say welcome to two very strong military navy 's as enemies . . 
  instead of one . 
  le : bulgaria does n't have a navy and neither we . 
  it 's because you offered asylum to those soldiers or something else ? 
  i ask because you said `` so predictable '' . 
  my dad ( who knows my grandma 's talking ) said that he understands better how his luxembourgish . . colleague . . talk than anyone from germany . 
  that 's it . 
  try to find a dictionary or something since i 'm dead meat when it 's about german language . 
  hey hey ... keep a cool head mate !, 
  lol, 
  this is just ... stupid if true !, 
  i guess from mongolia only mongols came . 
  from what i know turks came from a little west . 
  that 's another problem . 
  your gov can do that only to create a problem and if it escalates i bet my best shoes that all turkish population would back them only because a turkish ship was drowned . 
  it 's very easy and the best `` weapon '' semi-dictators use to gain more popularity . 
  i said ** more ** ** like ** !, 
  transylvanian saxon dialect is nothing like saxon dialect from saxony . 
   disputed waters that 's the problem . 
  especially when you have guns . 
  those are arabs . 
  serbs met them in bosnia only as mercenaries/mujahedins . 
  turks are n't desert people and neither are bosniaks .
