what 's to stop a country from voting to turn an ethnic group into slaves ? 
  when everyone votes , the small ethnic group , say - gypsies - might not have enough votes to maintain their liberty at a referendum . 
  all it takes is 50 % + 1 to cancel their liberties . 
  that 's democracy , too . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydroelectricity_in_romania ), 
  we have two working units already , and they generate 23 % of romania 's necessary energy . 
  the plan is to have 4 units generating 40 % of the necessary energy . 
  hydro is 27 % now . 
  that means about half the energy is `` clean '' , at the moment , and more in the future . 
   warsaw 's roman catholic archbishop because the church needs to be involved in our vaginas , never mind our souls . 
   if he has such a problem with abortions he should be practicing in a country where they are illegal or become a preacher or a morals philosopher , but give up practice . 
  because it 's the life of the patient at stake here , and the patient , as well as other doctors , have varied opinions on this issue . 
  thus , the doctor enforcing his own morality onto his patients at their expense is a betrayal . 
  why should his views be inflicted onto the life of someone else ? 
  is his moral sense so precious that they would let people suffer instead of helping out ? 
  is n't helping out patients his duty ? 
  he could give up his practice and become a philosopher of morals or preacher if he so wanted , not play doctor and let people suffer . 
   trade , travel , work and enjoy this magnificent continent the day romania was admitted in eu we got the right to trade , travel , work and enjoy eu . 
  we 've been here , in europe , fighting ottomans and such for 2000 years , but we needed visas to travel and enjoy . 
  it 's been the only good thing coming out of our membership in eu . 
  it used to feel like an open-air prison before . 
  i remember the day when a visa for west germany was as precious and hard to get as a winning lottery ticket . 
  google translate equilibrium start : input :  they probably ran it through google translate once or twice . 
  output :  google translation is probably looking at it once or twice .

  i am sure even 2 year olds are included in that blanket statement , because there is no mention of being otherwise , and the statement was pretty forceful . 
   roma are not criminals . 
  criminals are criminals . 
  no guys , i found it - it is not being roma , but wearing underpants that identifies 100 % of all criminals . 
  i say we should target people wearing underpants . 
  even between roma there are a few honest ones , but between criminals , 100 % wear underpants while planning and committing crimes . 
  every country on this earth would be perfect , were it not for the humans inhabiting it . 
  they probably do n't want people to live in italy , that 's why they are smearing it with shit like this . 
  also , disincentivizing remote work . 
  yes , what would stop those people from keeping the money abroad ? 
  nothing . 
  this only accomplishes a reduction in inbound money . 
  as a romanian who is staying home , i am amazed at this us-vs-them mentality in the press and comments . 
  i sure do n't want the uk to be less integrated or romanian children to grow separated from their working parents , but remember , it 's easy to blame a clearly delineated group . 
  unrelated tensions are happily vented at immigrants without much consideration about their validity . 
  it 's fear created for political purposes and massaged into a frenzy . 
  politics of fear - just like the war on terror - the scourge of our times . 
  fear catches on and spreads so much faster . 
  i know one , she 's cleaning my house . 
  i trust her with the keys . 
  i am very impressed by her moral behavior . 
  she never tried to pass off as romanian . 
  her son-in-law though just got out of prison . 
  the good ones have to suffer for the bad ones , and that 's very sad . 
  that would not mean accounts from cyprus can be accessed . 
  only uk accounts . 
  subsidiaries in other countries are independent entities , they do n't share accounts . 
   all the eu wants is that cyprus comes up with 1/3 of the rescue money itself . 
  that does not sound like an unreasonable requirement . 
  russian oligarch money do not belong to cyprus , or eu . 
  they are just in transit through cyprus . 
  they come from outside cyprus and eventually , are intended to leave cyprus . 
  to make an analogy , how about a mayor beef up the budget of his town with 10 % of the pocket money of all travelers passing through ? 
  because they need money and travelers have money on them . 
  would that be unfair ? 
   cyprus accepts the loan for the eu and manages to loan the other 7 billion from russia . 
  cyprus can pretend for a while longer everything is fine but its role as tax haven will diminish . 
  or , maybe , people see cyprus as having a backbone and sticking up for their investors . 
  having both the backing of eu and russia makes it `` double blessed '' , an even more attractive destination . 
  betting that russians wo n't let their money be seized , other investors will get confidence . 
  after the idea of plundering people 's accounts has been aired , cyprus immediately ceased to be a credible offshore destination . 
  no way to fix that now , even if nothing happens . 
   `` our domestic restaurants have not been , and will not be , impacted because we do not use any meat from europe '' the fault clearly lays with europe . 
  it 's the meat from europe that has horse in it , not their fault . 
  what could they have done ? 
  what can an honest american business do when opening shop in europe ? 
  horses just kamikaze themselves into taco bell kitchens here . 
  not if they say it is n't . 
  even rain water has been declared state property in some places , those who collect it being punished . 
  then you have to buy water at whatever rate the govt imposed monopoly desires . 
  please look up the [ bechtel caused disaster in bolivia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_cochabamba_protests ) from year 2000 . 
  [ [ convenient video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86n20ioigke ) ] ** tl ; dr ** world bank imposed water privatization -  bechtel lobbied for contract -  bechtel lobbied for privatizing rain water also -  raised the price of water to an impossible level -  people protested -  army was brought in to shoot them, 
   romania has only been a capitalist country for 20 years romania has only been an ** oligarchic ** country for 20 years ftfy, 
  i 've been in physics and informatics olympiada :-) some of my best school memories . 
  you should unroll the red carpet for mandache , if he chooses to stay in uk . 
  i 'd prefer him back in ro . 
  if by greece you mean the banks , then yes . 
  but only 10 % was for the people . 
  this crisis passes the risk accumulated by bad investments onto the shoulders of the population . 
  in other words , you ca n't put a strong horse and a sickly horse pull the same cart . 
  they would just stumble each other . 
  in the eurozone , with the current interest rate and exchange rate , only one of germany or greece might have an advantage . 
  greece ca n't keep up , so they are better off out of the euro . 
  the problem of greece is membership to eurozone . 
  it is unsustainable to have a currency that benefits germany ( interest rate , exchange rate ) and greece at the same time . 
  they are too different . 
  greece had to pay for that . 
  problem is , the architect does n't make photos and a photo is not a copy of a building . 
  it 's just a 2d image in a specific lighting and angle . 
  a photo of a building is as much a copyright infringement as sharing the name of a movie . 
  it 's not like that . 
  migrant workers make important contributions to the labour market in both high and low-skilled occupations . 
  migrants contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in individual benefits .
