   many of our freedoms are clearly too fundamental to be put up for popular election . 
  people also ca n't vote on laws of nature . 
  they can vote all they want that `` there is no global warming '' , that wo n't change reality one inch . 
  some things ca n't be decided by vote . 
  great advice , i did n't know any of the names . 
  alternatively ... people could buy [ romanian cheese ] ( http://beta.images.theglobeandmail.com/ffe/news/politics/article8286551.ece/alternates/w620/web-eu-trade05nw1.jpg ) , it 's just one type we simply call `` cheese '' . 
  but emmentaler we call `` cascaval '' and it 's not cheese . 
  you ca n't avoid it in many european cities , it was funny to see it treated as a rare special food by the clueless anime writers . 
   d\u00f6ner kebab i prefer kofta kebab ( minced meat kebab ) served with grilled hot peppers . 
  beats d\u00f6ner in my opinion . 
  do i still count as united with the turks ? 
  the countries at the top are going to see their jobs automated first . 
  just like ceausescu , in romania , before 1989 . 
  he was on all channels , always talking authoritarian bullshit to us . 
  `` has no value '' -  that 's a common line in romanian gipsy music ( manele ) . 
   create only specialists in subjects they choose at age 16 . who knows what they will want to do for the rest of their lives that 's the point . 
  you ca n't get by with math , physics and chemistry like in the 20th century . 
  they are too fast changing and require lifelong updating . 
  once you finished school , you have to continue learning . 
  there are thousands of online and offline courses now . 
  school is not the end of education , but a starting point . 
  if there 's one school subject that was not of any use to me , it was chemistry . 
  i not even once needed to know the formula of water or carbon dioxide in the two decades that followed school . 
  wasted a ton of time on it . 
  on the other hand , english and geography are some of the best things i learned in school . 
   some people know what other people think , no matter what . 
  it 's not the same thing . 
  windows is a for-pay product , and ie is part of windows . 
  chrome and google search are free ( as in free of payment , you 're the product ) . 
  android is open source too , except for a bunch of google apps which are free to use . 
  the main thing that google makes money off is advertising , but it is not a monopoly in that field . 
  then comes the play store - i do n't get why they have a problem with it . 
  android allows for alternate app stores , and google play is open to anyone who wants to publish an app , even their competition ( facebook , for example ) . 
  can we sue wikipedia for having a monopoly on enciclopedias ? 
  patriotism level : absolute, 
   if all those are freshened up and painted in warmer colors [ done in bucharest ] ( https://www.google.ro/maps/@44.4608223,26.0711481,3a,75y,314.46h,97.06t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1svl84ytmigvvgchsh8fnr-a!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dvl84ytmigvvgchsh8fnr-a%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d341.92007%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ro ) , well , a large portion at least . 
  there are still many blocks with pain from 1980 's . 
  the whole process was free in my part of the city , done with money from the city hall ( we have more tax income in our city hall than most ) . 
  for a few months , we had workers around all the windows of the block , up to the 10th floor . 
  pretty weird privacy moment . 
  and they did n't just paint the buildings , but also added thermal insulation . 
  the project was meant for insulating buildings , but changing their look was a much needed refresh of the city . 
   it seems ridiculous to apply it solely to men , turning them into some sort of dehumanized resource to be expended on the battlefield while women are spared it 's probably related to differences in reproduction roles . 
  a woman can only have a pregnancy at one time and a small few in total , but a man could father hundreds of kids if need be . 
  society has a better chance balance after the war if there are enough women . 
  you mean europe has neets ? 
  nah , it just ruffles their feathers a little bit , making them look more photogenic . 
  all castles are public ( state ) property except for peles which was recuperated by our ex-king . 
  everything is brutalist here ( what was built after 1950 ) . 
  i had a shock when i learned there was a name for this austere style . 
  i just thought it was the result of a generation of architects that had ideology-based education . 
  many of us have a parent from transylvania and a parent from moldavia or wallachia . 
  we see all three provinces as one single nation . 
  i agree . 
  [ here is the romanian plan .

  how do you know it 's not just a really well chilled vodka ? 
   saxons are german minority that came in transylvania in like 12 century and went back to germany at the end of the 20th . 
   i 'll sell your children that 's just as true as the obama birth certificate accusations . 
  if anything , i 'd like to have more ethnic germans in romania . 
  they have a civilizing influence . 
  ciorba is a kind of food in romanian too ( sour soup ) . 
  manele has the same general topic with r&b -  bragging about being rich , having sexy women , enemies should die of envy . 
   the toadlike appearance of the singer and his name is `` salam '' which translates to salami or sausage . 
  hey , revolutionary comrades got to eat too . 
  just been under that bridge a week ago . 
  here is [ a close up ] ( https://imgur.com/a/f75ki ) . 
  hint - there 's a surprising statue behind the bridge . 
  there 's also [ a cave in the mountain side ] ( https://www.google.ro/search?q=pestera+veterani&amp;num=100&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjsupj-7_juahuevbqkhzijclkq_auicigb&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=595 ) on the river bank , that used to be occupied by romans , later by austrians as a fort . 
   sex education is skewed/not prominent . 
  that figures , sex being the principal subject of religion .

  of course , the general trend in turkey being involution , they 'd stop teaching evolution . 
  eu is concerned with unity and cooperation and uk does n't offer that , the compensation money for brexit is a minor footnote to the real problem . 
  yes , exactly like that except communists . 
  how can a policeman with firearm protect people from a swerving truck ? 
  or a suicide bomber ? 
  terrorists can adapt . 
  putting guns in the hands of policemen is like putting strict tsa rules at airports - the terrorists will bomb a mall instead , or a crowded bus station . 
   watch out where the huskies go  an ' do n't you eat that yellow snow ( [ f.z. 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlippge45wm ) ), 
  interesting fact about germany , i had no idea they are into this stuff . 
  we got pretty good mineral water in romania as well . 
  as i travelled to many countries , i found a new appreciation for the quality of water back home . 
  it also reflects in the quality of wine and beer . 
  now that 's a nice paper . 
  so , if anyone has more information about this kind of economic simulations , how precise/useful are the predictions ? 
  does it compare to deep learning / ai ? 
  visited brazil last year and on the way back , i had a stop in portugal . 
  i loved the accent in brazil more . 
  sorry guys , it just sounds like music . 
  i would n't mind if countries on the other side of the globe joined , but the eu name would obviously have to change before that happens . 
  was it something like : '' *** be evil '' ? 
  i 'm wondering if *** was `` do '' or `` do n't '' . 
  what if you 're innocently walking on the sidewalk and a drunken driver runs you over ? 
  people die of someone else 's fault even without terrorism , and the number of victims is even greater . 
  it was a rational fear , but more people died of crossing the street that month in eu and nobody 's changing the policy of the country based on road accidents . 
  terrorism fear should be on the same level with falling in the bathroom fear . 
  well , they have police in germany .
