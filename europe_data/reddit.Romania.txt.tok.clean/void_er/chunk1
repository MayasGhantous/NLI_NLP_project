we can easily help them no we ca n't easily . 
  it takes lots and lots of resources to deal with all the direct and indirect issues . 
   but we ca n't directly help those in african or asian countries for example . 
  if you 're talking about a war torn region , yes we can . 
  nato can curb-stomp any army in that region . 
  the problem is that the us has its own problems and is tired of getting shafted by its european allies ... and the eu is too ridden with white guild , colonial guild and unwilling to take the blame if anything goes wrong . 
   also , this could actually prove to be quite a nice boost to the workforce in eu in longterm no it wo n't . 
  the eu needs skilled workers . 
  unskilled jobs ... they have plenty to choose from - and pick people who are not likely to cause problems and integrate well . 
   if managed properly ofcourse . 
  not gon na happen . 
  but then , lets spin this around . 
  in the same way , we get racial tensions from european natives . 
  the media may not want to say it , but some groups of immigrants or refugees have issues compared to the native population . 
  so when someone is beaten up , raped or killed for being an atheist , a jew , a woman `` who asked for it '' , gays , people who drink beer , apostasy , blasphemy , etc. 
  what will happen ? 
  that person knows that no other group would have done it - not even the `` right wing '' , `` neo-con '' , `` nazis '' as the media portraits all anti-immigration groups . 
  what other group will have popular support for stoning people for something like sex outside marriage ? 
  no one but muslims !, 
  and if the authorities continue to allow things like this do you not think that it will radicalize people against muslims ? 
  if someone raped your daughter or sister or mother for `` being a whore who asked for it '' will you , or i or everyone not want vengeance ? 
  letting in all immigrants who are not compatible with western culture will not magically make them like us . 
  it will not stop them from radicalizing . 
  this will lead to racial , ( religious and cultural ) tensions . 
  edit : words . 
  what about the other 3 billion people who are even more poor than the enonomic immigrants and live in even worse conditions ? 
  of course very few terrorists are going come as refugees . 
  they have plenty of money , so they will take a plane . 
  their work as terrorist recruiters starts only once they are here in the eu . 
  that 's a lot better than muslims . 
  i do not see vietnamese going all crazy over someone disrespecting their religion by some guy in some other country and burning shit . 
   saftey from more than a decade from nato and the eu eu is n't giving eastern europe any safety . 
  the us is doing that . 
  you guys do n't even pay for your military . 
   only response we get its `` fuck you its your problem '' . 
  you are a bunch of hypocrites , you make me sick . 
  we say this because the pro mass-immigration politicians are stupid as fuck . 
  europe simply can not support so many immigrants - many of which are economic immigrants , not actual refugees . 
  you push your heads in the sand about everything but the home refugee crisis . 
  western europe is cowardly and so afraid of being called colonial powers that they are unwilling to do what is necessary to actually protect people . 
  we ** know ** what happens in syria and iraq : mass murder , mass rape , genocide , slavery , chemical weapons , etc. 
  but you are militarily and morally too week to intervene and actually do something productive and help all of those people . 
  you do this because the us is unwilling to take the lead here , so you ca n't make them pay for everything and then blame them for everything that went wrong so you can remain smug in your superior morality . 
  yeah , the left would say : `` fuck them ! '', 
  because eu/us is filled by idiot politicians ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  they did n't enter eu through hungary . 
  they did it from greece . 
  the sad thing is that they could easily do it : * give incentives to have kids ( for the ** middle class ** ) * migrants from eastern-europe * migrants from non-muslim asian countries . 
  the danube - natural border ftw . 
  yes ... it also may depend on something like : global relative numbers in the whole world , or local , per country and then averaged . 
  most of the jews are in israel and the us . 
  so even if in the islamic world , most jewish people are persecuted , the number of jews in the us and israel skew that . 
   to turn it into an ally ? 
  russia does not want to be an ally . 
   to avoid war ? 
  this is plain stupid . 
  if russia ca n't be counted on to behave peacefully , as a fellow great power , then inviting it into your alliance is a bad strategy . 
   to bring peace ? 
  you do n't need a massive one world alliance to have world peace . 
  different organizations can trade and have a peaceful relations w/o needing to be military allies . 
  do we ally ourselves with best korea or isis to not start a war with them ? 
  that 's bs . 
  ukraine is not in nato . 
  it was n't trying to get it in nato . 
  the us has no actual obligation to protect ukraine . 
  the eu however , is to one throwing it under the bus . 
  the eu ( fr & ger ) is : * 1 , too afraid to do anything for fear of getting its gas cut * 2 , more preoccupied with trying to push out the us influence * and 3 , is downsizing its already weak military forces . 
  if the eu is unwilling to move its pinkie to do anything about ukraine , why the hell should the us involve itself ? 
  so it can get shit on by the self-righteous france and germany ? 
  they 're better off concentrating on sk and japan . 
  it shows that they are committed to our defense . 
  ignoring russia 's actions , shows that you do not have the will to take action . 
  nothing will happen now or even in 5-10 years . 
  later though , some political changes may result ... what if the us is forced ( by its debt and anti-us european sentiments , ) to pull out of europe or even nato altogether . 
  what then ? 
  sure , the russians probably wo n't try to invade western europe , but the other countries - close to russia 's border ? 
  why would you invite the enemy in your alliance ? 
  if the us becomes isolationist or pulls out of europe , i do n't think the eu has the willingness to protect the countries at the border with russia - even those in the eu . 
   yes , but in threads like these , that is not really relevant it very much is ( relevant ) : * sweden is a breeding ground for the progressive pc culture . 
  * any dissent from the accepted authoritarian ideology is immediately deigned as racist * censorship gets worse * any facts that show a different side than that of the establishment , is marginalized . 
  the progressives will attack any challenge to their ideology , because the narrative is more important than the truth . 
  what you perceive as right wing extremists are actually a multitude of different groups : * very few right wing extremists * a lot of moderate conservatives * people who oppose mindless immigration * a lot of left wing libertarians . 
  why is it that any one who is n't on your bigoted side is immediately deemed a racist ? 
   reddit is leftist it is . 
  take a look at the [ political compass ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/test ) test there are two axis as seen [ here  ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2 ) * left-right axis ( the traditional socialism vs capitalism ) * libertarian-authoritatian axis ( pc culture , censorship and social conservatives fall in the same category here ) so , reddit is left , but we tend to be more on the libertarian side . 
  have you ever considered that you are actually a bigot ? 
  ... and that your own bias - that you are in the right - is making you ignore all the legitimate points the other side has ? 
   it makes no sense to blame russia for being the best at it . 
  well , i am blaming it . 
   it does make sense to blame a country for aiding nazism , or furthering stalinism this is a double standard . 
  besides , the west aided the ussr as well . 
   yeah , but it was not the soviets who installed ceaucescu but romanian communists interested in going their own course , independent from the soviet union . 
  but soviets brought the communists here . 
  and while ceaucescu ( who is only the last communist president ) distanced himself from the soviets , the ussr would not have tolerated any departure from communism in romania . 
  if all of a sudden everybody in romania decided to become a democrat country , the red army ( or armies from neighboring countries ) would have been here within days . 
  the ussr exported their political system here . 
  as long as the soviets were strong enough , there could be no way to have any other political system than communism . 
  another reason why we had such terrible oppression is not just because we had such terrible `` supreme leaders '' . 
  they were terrible enough on their own , but we also had to pay a huge war debt to the soviets .
