  and we were forced to `` trade '' at criminal rates . 
  it is the allies who put that huge debt over romania - which combined with a political system as terrible as communism , crippled the country for over half a century . 
   blaming russia for the failures of your own communists is completely bonkers . 
  the soviets exported them . 
  given russia 's current behavior , we can see that they have n't changed their spots . 
  when the russians tear down their monuments of lenin and stalin , denounce communism , apologize the way germany did for hitler and return the romanian treasure they `` keep safe '' for us , i 'm going to keep blaming them . 
   the red scourge made romania join the nazis and attack the soviet union ? 
  actually yes . 
  the russian empire and its successor - the soviet union was well known for its desire to annex parts of romania ( among its many other territorial ambitions ) . 
  the allies were unwilling to deny the ussr 's territorial ambitions . 
  nazi germany had a policy of national self-determination , so we joined the war on their side . 
   were it the reds that appointed a north korea style dictator to to rule over your country ? 
  yes ? 
  romania 's population 's support for a communist party was pretty much non-existent . 
  many of the communist leaders were imported communists ( ussr agents ) . 
  the elections were massively fraudulent and we could n't do anything about it because of the red army . 
  the west did n't care enough about us to make a fuss . 
  so yes , it was soviet backed leaders who ruled over us at first . 
  dissidents , intellectuals , `` chiaburi '' ( peasants who were well off ) or anyone who was perceived as a threat were sent to prison , to rot in work camps or had their livelihood confiscated . 
  and then , the communists chose an uneducated common thief to lead us . 
  ( he was convicted to jail as a terrorist thief because he stole copper wire from trains in a time of war . 
  he got the terrorist part so he 'd stay longer in prison . ), 
  so yeah , the common romanian did n't have that much of a choice in our leaders . 
   which is weird because bucharest does n't have that big a muslim community . 
  not yet . 
  about 10 million . 
  lol, 
  romania looks like it will keep investing in it ( and stem disciplines in general ) . 
  we still have a high percentage of population in the rural area , so the effects of the low birthrates can be alleviated by shifting population from the rural area to the urban area . 
  when the automation crisis comes in the next two decades , romania may be well situated to take advantage of worker resources ( in stem ) that will keep ( or increase ) in value . 
  we may not have the private/corporate power of other countries , but we 'll probably keep a strong workforce . 
   if the investor party can properly demonstrate ... and who are the arbitrators they have to prove that to ? 
  corporate lawyers ? 
  as bad as governments can be , corporations ** will ** , not can , ** will ** be orders of magnitude worse . 
  wow , and i thought sweden was fucked up . 
  you nordics are a really different kind of crazy . 
  plus , if romania gets moldova back , it will also have a russian minority that can be `` oppressed '' ... and you know what russia does when their minorities get `` oppressed '' . 
  what i wonder is this : in eastern countries we sometimes have some shitty ( and sometimes not shitty ) laws that the eu is forcing us to change . 
  just how is germany being allowed to have laws that make it a criminal crime for citizens to criticize foreign political leaders ? 
  the us messed up and russia is going to win big from all of this . 
  well there you go . 
  those are high iq immigrants from country with an iq already close to that of germany . 
  culturally they were also relatively close to germany compared to the current wave . 
  eastern countries also had a very good education in stem . 
  i know that in romania for example , kids were about 1-2 years ahead of some western countries . 
  look at average iq per country of this wave of immigration . 
  coupled with bad economy , bad nutrition , bad education , bad culture and society , war ... how do people expect random economic migrants and refugees to score anywhere close to the native population and well integrated immigrants ? 
   raise taxes on the rich wonder what sweden will do when they start to cut into the bone with the taxes . 
  well ... it is a swedish study . 
  any swedish study that has anything to do with gender , immigration , iq is n't worth anything . 
  they censor , fudge and ignore data so much that it is n't even funny . 
  how can you have a proper study when half the data is censored and the other half is politically correct ? 
   i went to school with immigrants . 
  when was that ? 
  and were they were they from ? 
   i thought the slowest was left behind and eaten by predators . 
  that 's capitalism . 
   a herd of cows is as slow as the slowest cow . 
  this is in socialism . 
   basically , results from all demographics , poor or rich , are declining . 
  of course it is . 
  and that is because of immigration as well . 
  that is a normal result of economic , societal and cultural degradation . 
   that `` foreign god '' attitude the west clearly have their own problems . 
  but their culture does have many qualities that are admirable . 
  their societies are more free and they have a better standard of living . 
  if we ignore the new immigrant wave , they have lower criminality , etc. 
  what i am talking about is the admirable qualities of western culture , which we ourselves approve of . 
  it is sad that many african and middle eastern immigrants come to the west but make no attempt to learn the language , integrate , respect the local cultural norms and laws . 
  they want the free money , but they want to change europe into a copy of the failed states they came from . 
  it is even more sad that eu politicians and many among the population care so little about the bad stuff that comes out of this mass immigration situation . 
  our liberals are n't that much about pc-ness . 
  in romania , liberal is more aligned to capitalism . 
  it is the psd ( former prc aka commies , fsn aka commies , pdsr , etc ) who are more about welfare . 
  and they do n't need immigrants to buy votes from the way the west does . 
  we already have that . 
   would be just as much ee 's fault for the exact same reason that you attribute to west not necessarily . 
  i am not really afraid of the cultural impact on eastern europe . 
  by the time it is truly felt in ee , the west will be truly fubar . 
  we do n't have your white guilt . 
  we do n't have colonialism . 
  our conflicts were always about border conflicts - relatively small pieces of land . 
  if there is talk about guilt ... it is the ottomans - to whom we were forced to pay tribute and the ** blood tax ** and who enslaved us , it is the west , ottomans and russia who invaded us . 
  they have guilt ; we do not . 
  we are too resistant to the regressive left indoctrination . 
  it is too close to communist propaganda to swallow it , anyway . 
  what is going to hurt is the economy . 
   we always have a choice and here is the problem . 
  if western europe degenerates and becomes a third world shit-hole ... will eastern europe have any chance of survival ? 
  if your economy collapses from the strain , do you not think it will propagate ? 
  if that happens it is going to be us - eastern europe , who will feel it first because we are at the bottom of the pyramid . 
   at least speak for yourself . 
  what ? 
  are you saying that eastern europeans look at people who emigrate to the west badly ? 
  what , do they lose their cultural identity and become a foreign abomination ? 
  what about all of the workers from eastern europe that work in the eu ? 
  is there anything wrong with that ? 
  who do you speak for ? 
  edit : letter, 
  it is also because we look up to the western countries .
