  we see what we missed because of the communist regimes . 
  we want our countries to be more like the western countries at their best ... but we 're afraid that they are going to be turned into shit-holes . 
  we appreciate people who left eastern europe , settled into the west and forget a good life for themselves . 
  some of us want to do the same or hope that our countries will become rich enough that we 'll have a similar standard of living . 
  it is baffling to us that we , who have a much lower stake care more about the west than western citizens . 
  we 're angry because the best things about western civilization are being slowly destroyed . 
  and as the west degenerates , they will take eastern europe with them . 
   that the open borders are the cause of the problems . 
  this is actually the main problem . 
   besides this not being true oh , please . 
  i suppose that japan china and and korea is not racist ? 
  there 's nothing like that in s america ? 
  africa in particular has no problem , right ? 
  islamist countries do n't murder blasphemers , atheists , `` witches '' or chop up reformers . 
   muslims do get treated badly by the west really ? 
   and much more so than other populations . 
  oh ... now it 's an epidemic of racism ? 
  i guess the reason shiia and sunni want to murder each other is because of the west . 
  their own tribal conflict and history is unimportant . 
  the reason they slaughter apostates and gays is because of the west . 
  it 's not the fault of the west that most of the middle east and africa are filled with failed countries . 
  you want to feel guilty about colonialism ? 
  do n't drag the rest of us into it . 
  and i see no one talks about the ottomans ' colonialism . 
  about the blood tax , about how they castrated their slaves - or that even in this day and age , ** after the british empire imposed the end of slavery ** , the middle eastern countries still have slavery . 
   she 's putting the blame on something that did not cause the problem , only to further her own agenda . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the reason why muslims do not integrate and have so many terrorists is not the fault of the west . 
  western culture is the least bigoted in the world , so any problem muslim have in europe is ( mostly ) of their own making . 
   if you start a political discussion by lying , you will never reach a truthful outcome . 
  what lies ? 
  with the pressure in the west and assuming this crisis will continue next year as well , it will start trickling in the east as well . 
  true enough . 
  the muslims we have here : * tartars ( well integrated and kinda distrustful of foreign muslims ) and * recent immigrants : did n't get hundreds of mosques with radical extremist imams but we 're part of the eu and this wo n't stay contained to the west . 
   if anything , that would be puttting the horse behind the cart . 
  oh look my left leg is missing . 
  i did it myself because ... reasons . 
  whatever shall i do ? 
  it kind of hurts . 
  i know !, 
  i not going to bandage it . 
  i 'm going to cut the other leg as well . 
  i 'm sure this is going to make things better . 
   once part of the ottoman empire ( yes i know about the significant autonomy ) so technically , we were n't part of the ottoman empire . 
  and not all of romania was under ottoman influence . 
  yeah , the equivalent of christian moderates are the muslim reformers , like maajid nawaz . 
  yeah . 
  that 's the same in most of eastern europe , i think . 
  but no one is seriously saying that we should kill or imprison gays . 
  marriage and adoption for gays ? 
  sure most east-europeans are against it . 
  the rest ? 
  not their business . 
   minimize the overall number of dead people resulting from this conflict . 
  what i want to minimize is the number of dead people who are ** not ** terrorists . 
  and these are note the only victims . 
  what about the western kids that go to school with muslims and get the shit beaten out of them ? 
  what about the atheists and reformers in the muslim world who get murdered every day ? 
  if we in the west are terrorized into de facto blasphemy laws , what chance do they have ? 
  what about the genocide , rape and mass murder committed by isis ? 
  before you can fix something you have to recognize and admit that there is something wrong . 
  one way or the other , they 'll find some way to get offended in this day and age : israel , drones , not raping and murdering , a complete stranger in a country that has nothing to do with extremists do something that offends them - but which is completely in line with western values . 
  no , doing nothing is not the solution . 
   security guard presence has quadrupled in the last couple of years . 
  really ? 
  first time i 've heard this . 
  so , are some of these officers becoming private security ? 
  i hope this is n't going to turn into a south africa type of thing . 
  how are swedes reacting to this phenomenon ? 
  the taxes there are huge , but there is also the expectation of good institutions . 
  is n't paying twice for the same thing ( police and private security ) upsetting people ? 
  it 's probably the influx of mass immigration that caused the gov 's to not have enough money to pay for everything . 
  this coupled to the huge increase of work and danger the police has to deal with , have caused them to leave the sinking boat . 
  what i was wondering , is if the police people who left gave a more in-dept reason than : `` not enough money '' - like why exactly are they so overworked , why is n't the government paying them , etc. 
  is this only about the pay ? 
  or are there other reasons for this , like government , regulations , pc culture , laws , effects of too much immigration , etc ? 
  ** edit ** : i 'm being down-voted because just questioning the regressive left means i am an evil , dirty , nazi racist or whatever . 
  that was the only sane candidate from the democrats . 
  there 's three people the establisment does n't want :  trump - because he 's not a corporate whore and he might actually change some things ... and the constipation , government parasites and media find this abhorrent . 
   rand paul - he 's libertarian and kind of military isolationist . 
   sanders - he 's so socialist he 's almost a communist . 
  the democrats know that a little socialism assures having a trough to get them votes , but too much of it will hasten the destruction of the us economy . 
  the corporate ideal candidates were suposet to the jeb bush and h. clinton . 
  no matter who won , it would be a continuation of `` how things are done '' . 
  the popularity of carson , trump and sanders are the result of the disgust towards the politicians . 
  carson is a likable fellow , but i do n't think he has the actual political , military and economic know how on how to be a good president . 
  he 's smart enough to listen though . 
  also he 'd not be as divisive as obama , which is why he 's so respected by the conservatives . 
  he is n't the kind of person to play the racial card or incite racial and class tensions as obama has reveled in . 
  trump is very against pc-ness - which is hell on the left - specificallly the `` regressive left '' - as maajid nawaz describes them . 
  he 's very attractive to those who are disgusted by the authoritarian left . 
  the minorities who are fed up by the left 's bigotry of low expectations will also like trump ( and carson as well ) . 
  and trump ... even though he 's called a racist , misogynist or crazy , is obviously none of that . 
  he 's politically and economically savvy to be a good president . 
  and he 's not so crazy with the religion issues that most conservatives candidates are - he 's kind of moderate on those issues . 
   i expect both the right and the left to be concerned about this . 
  the liberals are going to start to feel stupid in a few years . 
  they were the ones who got more immigrants to get more votes . 
  for now , they are still not worried , because the islamist parties are likely to vote with them on most issues ... but in a few years , the islamic vote will be so strong that they 'll have too much power . 
  and pass them forward . 
  i saw your pm address to the eu parliament ( i think ) and he was quite eloquent on the subject .
