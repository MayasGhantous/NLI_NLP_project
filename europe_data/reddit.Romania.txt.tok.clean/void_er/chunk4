  what the west does is not even double standards . 
  when hungary did it , it was well within its rights and duties to protect eu 's external border . 
  this time , they and russia will go as allies ... and the middle east will be poland . 
  can confirm . 
  source : mother , father , grandparents . 
  we love germans . 
   it had to happen , our society is naive for the most part . 
  this is why east-europeans were against all of this ... because we know what is going to happen . 
  it is why , i think , a lot of us are frustrated with the the west . 
  we 've experienced communism , so we know what a fucked up regime it was and how it destroyed our economy and culture . 
  all of the bad stuff that we have ( corruption , stupidity , fucked up culture , etc ) and want to improve - to become more like the western world , is ten times worse in the middle east and africa . 
  and the leaders of the eu somehow think that they can fix it while keeping their pristine cloak of smug superiority . 
  the truth is that there are two ways to fix any shitty country : 1 . let them fix it by themselves , giving aid where you can ; 2 . do what the us did with japan and germany after ww2 . 
   we are talking about citizens with immigrant background , ie 2nd + generation immigrants . 
  i 'm was referring to very new citizens ( 1st gen ) and the very many immigrants and refugees in sweden . 
   i disagree . 
  each individual has a direct relationship to the state . 
  and yet whites are supposed to have white guilt for suposedly how terribly racist they are . 
   there is only one entity that is responsible for fixing problems and improving living conditions in a country , and that is the government . 
  no , it is a national/cultural issue . 
  if one part of the population is 3-10-30 times more likely to commit violence/rape/murder then that group has a problem . 
  we should bring attention to the problem and try to fix it . 
   every time you compare group a to group b , you 'll find that there are statistically relevant differences between them ... 
  yes . 
   ... are very significant differences . 
  yes . 
   the latter would not justify discrimination towards ... 
  yes . 
  not justified to discriminate against individuals . 
  but it is a justification for policy changes - because that 's what nations do . 
  they look at education and say : need more x. 
  they look at crime and say : too much . 
  they look at mental illness , depression , health , etc. 
  and then , they ( should ) implement policies that do the most good using the least amount of resources . 
   not in the eyes of law it does n't . 
  it should n't . 
  everyone should be equal under the law . 
   the latter would not justify discrimination towards men , nor would you encourage all men to `` show responsibility and solve the problem '' . 
  and this it the hypocrisy of the regressive left : on the one hand : `` teach men not to rape '' and `` white guilt '' , but on the other : `` profiling is bad '' and `` crime statistics about certain minority groups are racist '' . 
   nor would you encourage all men to `` show responsibility and solve the problem '' . 
  yes . 
  but i 'm not asking for group x to highhandedly solve problem a in their group . 
  i 'm asking to : * first : them and other groups to acknowledge it . 
  ( and we 're still at this stage . 
  we 're still in the denial phase . ), 
  * second : put policies in place to mitigate or solve the problem . 
  we ca n't get to the second step , because we still deny that there is a problem . 
   you can ** counter ** that with similar things coming from the other end of the spectrum -- the `` rape statistics '' in sweden sure , i 'll give you that . 
  these studies are really weird because they differ from country to country or what the authors consider to be rape . 
  sometimes they include ( or not ) things like `` eye-rape '' , but think that male rape is not rape unless it is forced penetration of some particular kind . 
  spousal rape is sometimes included and other times it is n't . 
  what it is better to do is compare like to like : as one ** type ** of rape in a country with the exact same type in another country . 
  so the statistics here are kind of messed up ... 
  but then again ... the left authoritarians comes with things like : `` oh we are so progressive that we report rape far more than other countries . '', 
  but here they ignore that there are statistics for both actual convictions and estimated rapes . 
   all the examples you mentioned seem like reasonable assumptions to me , although i 'd have to see those problematic studies that you saw for myself . 
  the most ... unprofessional and anti-scientific is the .77 cents myth . 
  this takes average income without taking into accounts hours , overtime , job type . 
  the most funny thing is that the place that this myth comes from - the actual study ( sometimes in the seventies or eighties i think ) - actually concludes that after you take into account these simple factors , the income difference goes down significantly . 
  and yet obama actually repeated the .77 cents thing . 
   ultimately , swedish citizens are perpetuating the crimes . 
  no they are n't . 
  immigrants are not citizens until they get citizenship . 
  and most importantly you ca n't blame white people - who pay takes and take in refugees and immigrants and call them racist even though a disproportional amount of the violence committed comes from immigrants and refugees . 
   making racially-colored studies is not relevant to begin with yes it is . 
  you need to name the problem before you can fix it . 
  those minorities must show responsibility , try to fix the problem , assimilate and not call everyone racist the moment a problem is pointed out . 
   but then again they also have the most skewed class distribution and belong to the demographics that are more prone to crime regardless of background . 
  again this is completely false . 
  you take poor non-muslim asians and their crime is lower . 
  compare indians with pakistanis , chinese with muslims . 
  culture matters . 
  no , when people lie over and over , when they misrepresent studies and data , you are going to be more and more skeptic of their assertions . 
  so , until i see the study ( something non-biased ) , that says that ** native , white swedes ** are perpetrating those crimes ... and that they are actually crimes and not `` cyber-violence '' i 'm not going to put much trust in what they say . 
  some examples of why i do n't trust the regressive left narrative : * that myth that women get payed .77 cents per dollar compared to men * that 1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted in universities . 
  * crime statistics * human rights violations in islam i actually delved a bit into these and checked the facts . 
  and what do i get ? 
  lies , bad studies , pseudoscience , and so on . 
  of course i 'm skeptic . 
  i 'm wondering what exactly goes through their mind . 
  these guys have millions and billions at their disposal . 
  there 's plenty of women who would be perfectly willing to play the concubine for a few years . 
  hey !, 
  swedes are n't racist . 
  do you think that if the riffraff was sent back to their country they would n't rape ? 
  sweden is n't so racist that they would allow non-white , non-swede women to be raped instead of the white descendants of slavers and colonialists . 
  and then ... when they rape someone from their own country , they might not be treated well by their native government , courts and prison . 
  that would be simply horrid . 
  that 's what i was thinking . 
  where do those numbers come ? 
  is it white people doing it ? 
  or is it tribal conflicts ? 
  just like violence against jews ... 
  i think it is a higher chance ( statistically ) that the average immigrant is far more likely to do it than - not the average white - but a certified nazi . 
  and of course they conveniently forget ( or who knows - maybe they actually do n't know ) that it was white people ( specifically - the british empire ) who stopped slavery . 
  they do n't care that ** all of africa ** had slaves . 
  that some countries in africa got huge amounts of income from slavery . 
  they were sold like cattle not only to europeans , but the ottoman empire ( who castrated their slaves ) . 
  the british empire used one third of their budget trying to stop slavery . 
  can you imagine that ?
