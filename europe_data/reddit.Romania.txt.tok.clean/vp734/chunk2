  that 's one of the things i hate about the ` great union ' . 
  you should read this article to give you an idea of the general context and the demands of the transylvanians : http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/controversa-a-vrut-iuliu-maniu-autonomia-ardealului-139672.html also , there 's this false idea that romanians ( vlachs ) in transylvania were continually oppressed , which is false . 
  people seem to think that all romanians here were forced into being peasants , while hungarians were all part of the opressing class . 
  that 's false ; there were many vlach nobles here , even though some chose to adopt hungarian culture over the generations . 
  likewise , there were hungarian peasants . 
  in fact , they ( hungarians , romanians , etc. ), 
  often revolted against the nobility alongside . 
  the interethnic conflict has n't always existed , and it 's mostly a result of the rise of nationalism , so it goes back two centuries , more or less . 
  also , let 's not forget about the import of people from the other regions of romania during the communist regime which ultimately sought to dilute the sense of identity that was left among transylvanians . 
  another thing that disgusts me is the wipe-out of the romanian church united with rome ( greek-catholic ) -- that was dominant among romanians in transylvania before communism -- at the behest of the romanian orthodox church which heavily collaborated with the regime and came out stronger than ever after the revolution . 
  not only do they now build kitsch churches at an alarming rate , but they also refuse to give back the buildings that were confiscated by the communists only to be handed to them ; many of these churches or parts of them are being destroyed only to bring them closer to the orthodox style or whatever the hell they 're doing . 
  even though the term * t\u0103tar * is sometimes used in romania to designate a person of mongol origin , in its more widely accepted meaning it refers to a number of turkic peoples , including cumans . 
  there were various iranian peoples that throughout history have settled on the territory of present-day romania : sarmatians , iazyges , roxolani , scythians , etc. 
  do n't forget to check out / r/europeanculture !, 
  he 's referring to the population of greenland , which is about 55,000 . 
  500 million eur is the the annual block grant from the danish state to greenland , according to the article . 
  btw my name is actually vlad and i 'm from transylvania . 
   nah , it 's actually the flag of transylvania . 
  huh ? 
  as are `` wallachia '' and `` wallonia '' . 
  yes i was exaggerating , but i think you know what i 'm trying to say . 
  do n't get me wrong , it bothers me just as much when i encounter ponta fans , the kind that blame everything on b\u0103sescu . 
  i would just like people to be a little more impartial , if possible . 
  it would also help if those that discuss politics ( not just on reddit ) had a memory span longer than that of a goldfish . 
  tell me about it ... 
  i ca n't fucking stand the pm either , but the circlejerk in favour of b\u0103sescu and against the pm that you can find on / r/romania outmatches even the circlejerk on / r/murica , and supposedly the latter is satire . 
  what does mongolia have to do with the fact that he is hungarian ? 
  actually , why do i even bother asking ? 
  you must be one of * those * people ... 
  i misunderstood what he said . 
  i thought he was confused as to why they used footage from the same tv station for both romania and moldova . 
  but now i see that he was actually saying that since it 's the same language it should n't be counted twice . 
  my bad . 
  actually the footage is from protv chi\u0219in\u0103u , so the presenters and reporters are most likely moldovan .

  for example , this time you can see norway , iceland and turkey were included . 
  i do n't like to make maps that compile data from different sources since most of the time the methodology used in two studies is n't exactly the same .

  people ( well , usually old people , but not only ) sometimes take a nap around that time , so it 's considered rude to make noise . 
  at least that 's what happens here .

  he did n't say that he was `` a senior officer in ** communist ** intelligence services '' , and / r/cmatei just pointed out that turcescu was only 14 in 1989 , when the regime fell . 
  so , why did you add `` communist '' in the title ? 
   some pointers for the conflicts between moldova and wallachia ? 
  the [ battle of soci ] ( http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/b%c4%83t%c4%83lia_de_la_soci_\\ ( 7_martie_1471 \\ ) ) and the [ battle of finta ] ( http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/b%c4%83t%c4%83lia_de_la_finta_\\ ( 17/27 _ mai_1653 \\ ) ) are only two examples . 
  there are others , but i do n't remember the names . 
   the history of the the romanians from south of the danube especially those part of what is known as the second bulgarian empire also , no one seemed interested in explaining the peculiar similarities between the romanian language and albanian , that suggest a coexistence of the two ethno-linguistic groups somewhere in the balkans . 
  we are told that the similarities are there because they share words of dacian or thracian origin , something which is absurd and the most simplistic explanation . 
  the fact is that people do n't like to talk about this because they feel that would be against what we * have * to believe , i.e. 
  the fact that there was this daco-roman continuity on the territory of present day romania . 
   the fact that cumans ( a turkic people ) had an important role in our history from about the 11th to the 14th century . 
  cumans are not the only ones that are left out . 
  there were also avars , pechenegs , gepids , goths , sarmatians , iazyges , among other populations of the migration period that left their mark culturally as well as genetically , to some extent . 
  but since this would contradict the simplistic perspective on the ethnogenesis of the romanian people , they are only briefly mentioned , if at all . 
  well the history that is taught here is the history of the romanian people . 
  so , as you can imagine , not only are a lot of events and personalities presented in a false or distorted way to fit the nationalist agenda of the last 50 years , but what bothers me just as much is that we were taught close to nothing about transylvania . 
  why ? 
  well , probably because the imbeciles decide what kids should be taught believe that since the region was n't ruled by romanian voivodes ( well there was john hunyadi that was of vlach ( romanian ) ancestry and probably some others , just like there were countless nobles throughout transylvania that were vlachs , contrary to what we are led to believe , i.e. 
  that romanians were always persecuted ) we should n't learn about it very much . 
  of course , this leads to a lot of ignorance among people that end up believing that there 've always been ethnic tensions between romanians and hungarians , among other absurdities . 
  generally , one of the most common errors that persist in the history program is the projection of current problems and ideals in the past : for example , many believe that michael the brave united the romanian principalities driven by nationalist fervour and was aiming for `` national unity '' . 
  keep in mind that all this happened around 1600 , when there was no such thing as nationalism . 
  other aspects of the history of the romanian principalities that are left out of the books include the recurrent conflicts that existed between wallachia and moldavia ; sometimes they even allied with szeklers or hungarians to fight off each other . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  it was part of the kingdom of hungary for hundreds of years before it was part of the austro-hungarian empire . 
  and even then they had autonomy , for fuck 's sake . 
  what is your opinion on the ttip ? 
   they clearly told me that in the current situation they do not want autonomy . 
  at least the young and educated ones . 
  the population is made up of different people , both educated and uneducated , young and old . 
  just because you encountered some young educated people that oppose autonomy that does n't mean that all educated young people do , nor does it mean that the majority of the population opposes it . 
  everyone 's vote weighs the same . 
   because it will be worse for them . 
  they can not live only from tourism there . 
  and maybe services , but who will open offices when their biggest city has 38,000 inhabitants ? 
  that 's for the inhabitants to decide , all of them ( young , old , hungarians , romanians , etc. ) . 
  i really do n't understand some people 's double standard on issues like this . 
  for example , i 'm fairly certain that almost all of the romanians that oppose the szeklers ' right to decide if they want autonomy are totally perfect with the fact that romanian transylvanians chose to unite with romania ( even though transylvania 's autonomy was soon abolished by the government , contrary to the will of those that voted for the union ) . 
  sure , i would like szeklerland to be part of transylvania if the latter ever becomes autonomous , as it 's been for centuries before ( while maintaining some autonomy for itself ) , but that 's not for me to decide ; the people that live there have that right . 
  oh come on ... every time there 's a story about cluj on / r/romania , people start talking about the fact that we do n't have a metro . 
  calm down . 
  there are other cities that might be better suited for you , especially in transylvania ( you mentioned bra\u0219ov but there are others ) : cluj , timi\u0219oara , sibiu , t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 , etc. 
  people here are considered less rude , we do n't have problems such as stray dogs , much more central-european ( you might find it a little more close to slovakia in terms of culture ) , rich history , beautiful buildings , the region seems to be developing very fast , it 's more foreigner-friendly and multicultural . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  the fact that they live in a peaceful region has led to them not needing an army . 
  is n't that a consequence of being peaceful , rather than the cause ? 
  yes . 
  they 're such a diligent , industrious , creative , organized nation with great history and culture . 
  10/10 , would love to be a part of . 
   so if transylvania means a place where hungarians and romanians live inside romania , then the partium should also be considered part of it . 
  nowhere does it say that transylvania * means * a place where hungarians and romanians live inside romania . 
  the map just depicts the region of transylvania proper . 
  seriously , you are reading to much into it and ascribing it more meaning than it is supposed to convey .
