  just look at the source link i posted in this thread ...

  you should compare the gdp per capita before the war with that right at the end of the communist regime , not with the gdp from 2014 . 
  also , this comparison should be made between countries that were at a similar level before in order to get a more accurate idea of what the communist regime has done .

  ** description : ** students participating in second stage of tertiary education in science and technology fields of study , as a percentage of the population 20-29 year old . 
  this table includes the total number of students in tertiary programs which leads to an advanced research qualification ( isced level 6 ) , in the educational fields science , mathematics and computing and engineering , manufacturing and construction . 
  the levels and fields of education and training used follow the 1997 version of the international standard classification of education ( isced97 ) and the eurostat manual of fields of education and training ( 1999 ) . 
  there is a commune in romania where there are ** 28 ** churches ( orthodox , all of them , what else ) . 
  these villages lack drainage systems ... 
  i think it also has to do with the fact that there are many cities without ring roads and that leads to big trucks being forced to pass right through them and they create a lot of noise , and in some cases it actually damages the buildings . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  however , the title of the eurostat table is ` proportion of population living in households considering that they suffer from noise ' and i thought that it did n't convey what this data actually represents , because it does n't specify what kind of noise it is referring to . 
  i also considered shortening it by compressing ` eu , iceland and norway ' to just ` eea ' but then that would include liechtenstein for which there is no data available and it would exclude croatia which is not part of the eea yet . 
  also , it only furthers the confusion since the average reader on reddit might not know about what ` eea ' stands for . 
  note that malta is number one in this map . 
  ** edit : ** but i know that feeling ... thank zalmoxis i 'm not living in a block of flats anymore . 
  you mean the title sounds confusing ? 
  yes , i agree , but how else would you have named it ?

  i ca n't find anything related to this concept on the eurostat website . 
  there is however a wikipedia article on the subject : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_exclusion . 
  yeah well i forgot to point out that these numbers represent the expenditures on social protection as a percentage of total general government expenditures .

   i find it sad they want so desperately to be considered `` central '' europe after they 've been associated with eastern europe for so long . 
  before the communists took over these countries had much more in common with central european and western european countries than you think -- culturally , religiously , economically , historically , etc. 
  i 'd even say transylvania was central european until a few decades ago ... 
  nobody likes to be placed in eastern europe . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  also , do you think that the speed also counts as a distinctive element ? 
  for example , people in southern romania talk quite fast compared to those in the north . 
  is that taken into account when comparing the varieties of a language ? 
   how is a `` dialect '' different from `` accent + regionalisms '' ? 
  well we know that the distinction between a language and a dialect is blurred too ... 
  however , in my opinion , the varieties of romanian within romania are very easily intelligible regardless of where in the country you are from . 
  but of course i 'm no linguist , and i thought that there must be more substantial differences in order for a language variety to qualify as a dialect . 
  i 'm probably wrong . 
  share of people ... 
  source : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/4-18122013-bp/en/4-18122013-bp-en.pdf . 
  sadly , there are no dialects of the romanian language within romania ( anymore ) . 
  we do have differing accents and regionalisms though , but that 's something pretty much every language has . 
  however , when i was living in italy they taught us a bit of piemont\u00e8is . 
  such an interesting language/dialect -- a blend of italian and french . 
   this is arguably what has driven romanians from some regions to isolate in mountains and live quiet for centuries , just to descend to low lands when the situation eased ; around the 12th century in wallachia and later in transylvania . 
  that 's interesting . 
  where exactly did you find that information ? 
  i know there are legends regarding the founding rulers of both wallachia and moldavia around the 12 ^ th and 13 ^ th centuries , but that does n't mean that vlachs did n't inhabit these lands before . 
  it 's true , i should have added it among the causes that i enumerated . 
   western europe was shielded from foreign invasions by the sea on one side and buffer zones as eastern european lands on the other for the whole time . 
  this is mostly true , but that does n't mean that western european states did n't fight among themselves . 
  that 's what i meant to say with that last phrase : the people living in this region were n't the only ones that had to defend themselves , thus wasting resources . 
  we sure love to blame the `` invaders '' . 
  does he really blame them for `` burning and destroying everything in their path '' ? 
  maybe he does n't know that the inhabitants of wallachia and moldavia ( he thinks they were romanians , as if national identity was actually a thing in those times ) regularly did exactly that when they did n't feel like facing the enemies in combat . 
  here 's part of my response to a comment made a while ago when someone argued that the romanian principalities valiantly opposed the turks , thus managing to maintain autonomy . 
   also , the way we usually resisted the ottoman attacks -- by employing the strategy of the scorched earth -- , even though sometimes effective , is one of the reasons why we have started to stagnate in terms of culture and civilization compared to western medieval states , among the most visible effects of this being a certain lack of fortified medieval cities ( which determined weak administration , the lack of universities , etc. ), 
  and bad or nonexistent infrastructure . 
  one of the reasons for this is , of course , the fact that the strategy was most suitable for rural settlements which in my opinion favoured the preponderence of this semi-permanent type of establishments . 
  while the strategy might have deterred or even worked to repel the invaders , it has certainly impoverished and caused stagnation in the principalities , effects of which can be observed , to some extent , even today . 
  my point is that history is much more complicated than it seems and -- while i know that this was n't supposed to be a comprehensive lecture about the history of romania -- this does n't mean we should continue to spew this nationalistic propaganda . 
  the causes for the lagging behind of romania are multiple and intercorrelated and range from the short reigns caused by a strange succession system in the principalities , corruption ( it is widely known that the `` nobles '' that aspired to become rulers could just ask the sultan to grant them the title , in exchange for a hefty bribe , of course ) , the indifference and inability of most of these rulers to develop the regions and improve the infrastructure , the tributes that the principalities had to pay to the ottomans as suzerain territorial entities of the empire . 
  i would even argue that the orthodox church itself should take some of the blame for this ; religion played a major role during the middle ages , and the divide between the orthodox east and catholic and protestant west is too clear not to consider that it might have had something to do with the predominant denominations . 
  of course , last but not least , the communist regime : it managed to pretty much destroy the improvements made since the mid-nineteenth century . 
  to think that western europe was bereft of wars while we , `` romanians '' , managed to shield them from the invaders is idiotic . 
  edit : added a sentence about the communist regime . 
  thanks . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i used colorbrewer for the color scheme and it looked good , but i see now that it 's too similar to the grey color used for countries with no data available .

  edit : and various iranian peoples . 
  i think it does actually , seeing that one of the targets of the eu is to raise the share of renewable energy consumed in transport to at least 10 % by 2020 . http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/energy/introduction therefore , i assume that the transportation sector is taken into account . 
  here it is : [ share of renewables in energy consumption in the eu & norway \\ ( 2012 \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dvwsod6.png ) . 
  well ... 
  i started with the map that you sent me that had non-eu countries coloured . 
  the first thing i did was to remove the text and colour from those countries , and then i inserted the numbers only for the eu countries . 
  because i was n't paying attention i did n't really notice norway , until now , having linked the pdf ... 
  this is n't the only mistake apparently : i should have specified in the title that this data represents the share of renewables in energy consumption , not production . 
  oh well , it 's my first map , something had to go wrong . 
  i think you mean 98.5 % of norway 's renewable energy comes from hydropower . 
  but it is even higher indeed : norway 's share of renewable energy is 64.5 % . 
  edit : actually it was 98.5 % of norway 's energy generation in 2008 , but this map represents the consumption of energy . 
  corrected version ( includes norway and specifies that it refers to the share of renewables in energy consumption ) : http://i.imgur.com/dvwsod6.png source : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/8-10032014-ap/en/8-10032014-ap-en.pdf, 
  interesting . 
  i did n't know about this . 
  what for ? 
  the budget allocated for it may very well be relatively small . 
  but what they do is they pass various amendments to the budget ; that 's how they increase the money given to the church quite significantly . 
  and the money goes mostly to the romanian orthodox church in return for ` support ' provided for the politicians during elections . 
  it 's a vicious cycle . 
   by law , the state is obliged to provide support for church construction and for the renovation of dilapidated buildings . 
  in my opinion the state should only give the church money for buildings and monuments of historical and cultural value ( such as putna and others ) , not help them build more , especially since the new ones are very `` kitschy '' . 
  there is no free trade agreement between the eu and africa . 
  what exactly are you talking about ?
