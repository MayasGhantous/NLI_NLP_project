  all of the kings and emperors of the gypsies seem to be overweight . 
  - [ emperor iulian i ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/iulian_r%c4%83dulescu ) of the gypsies everywhere - [ king daniel i ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_cioab%c4%83 ) of the gypsies from romania - international [ king dorin i ] ( http://www.dorincioaba.ro/ ) of the gypsies - international [ king ilie i ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilie_badea_st%c4%83nescu ) of the christian gypsies everywhere no mustaches though . 
  : there might be others that i 'm not aware about . 
  well the majority of people would be against countries renouncing their independent foreign policy and national interests . 
  while this might have disadvantages as we can see in the poor coordination of this crisis , you ca n't just force this process and transfer all the powers to the eu level . 
  maybe it will happen eventually , but it 's clear that at the moment there is n't the political and popular will for such drastic changes . 
  and assuming again that you 're referring to the eu , i do n't agree that we `` congratulate ourselves over meaningless bullshit '' . 
  the eu has achieved great things , and i think that while it 's not the most influential international actor , it does benefit its members to be a part of it . 
  you do know there are multiple countries in europe with different foreign policies and interests , do n't you ? 
  hell , even russia is in europe ( partially ) . 
  belarus is in europe . 
  do you expect them to have an attitude even remotely similar to countries like poland or romania on this issue ? 
  of course not . 
  if you were talking about the eu , then yes , i agree that the overall reaction has been quite mild . 
  but there are a few things you should note . 
  first , we do n't have a unified military . 
  also , the us does n't depend nearly as much on trade with russia as some eu countries do . 
  therefore , the sanctions do n't affect your country as much as some of the countries that have been reluctant towards imposing further sanctions . 
  what i 'm saying is that you should take these things into consideration if you really wish to compare the us with europe . 
  i never said that the shooting was n't two-sided . 
  yes , there were some protesters with guns . 
  but the authorities should n't have started using guns , because that 's what led to this . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_killed_during_euromaidan ) 's a wikipedia page with references for almost all of the victims listed . 
  what does that have to do with this ? 
  also , the eu offered ukraine a deal . 
  is that wrong ? 
  why is n't it wrong that russia stuck its nose for more than 20 years in ukrainian politics ? 
  while yanukovych was democratically elected , that does n't mean that people ca n't protest against him . 
  and that 's what they 've been doing , until the authorities started using lethal force . 
  that 's when things got ugly . 
  yeah , it 's always the eu 's fault . 
  they also killed a hundred civilians and invaded crimea , right ? 
  i think that 's actually produced in the moldova region in romania . 
  the present-day republic of moldova ( sometimes called bessarabia ) and the romanian region called moldova together form the historical region of the principality of moldavia ( which also included the northern part of bukovina , as well as the southern budjak region ) , as it 's known in english and other languages . 
  in romanian , ` moldova ' can be used to refer to all three territorial entities . 
  but i can see how it 's confusing . 
  this is hardly news . 
  we know that there are extremists among the leading politicians of ukraine . 
  it 's just that this ca n't be used as an excuse for invading a sovereign country . 
  if they tried to commit genocide or other crimes against the population , then yes , that would constitute a reason to try to topple their government . 
  but this has not been the case . 
  here 's a list compiled by / u/regularjerk not so long ago . 
  it contains romanian phrasemes and their translation ( both literal and approximate ) . 
  i just added some diacritic marks and made a few minor corrections .

  is it so hard to just tell me ? 
  interesting . 
  i know that among the rebels there are terrorist groups , but i did n't expect that number . 
  do you have any sources to back that up ? 
  also , have there really been polls done during the war period that confirm what you just said , that assad is supported by the majority of syrians ? 
  and what exactly are they propagating ? 
  what do you need the gun for ? 
  i think they want to imitate the churches which usually have a cross on the roof ( or on the bell tower ) . 
  i 've seen gipsy houses with the dollar and euro symbols on top of their ` towers ' . 
  i view that as a collective trademark law and it seems fair . 
  are you also against trademark laws in general or just this particular kind ? 
  besides , there are similar laws even in the us . 
  my bad . 
  if it 's a poll it should be representative . 
  there 's no need to ask the entire population in order for it to be representative , as long as the sampling is done by taking into account the characteristics of the groups ( age , ethnicity , religion , social status , income , etc. ), 
  within the population . 
  he was just saying that there does n't seem to be any correlation between the revolution and this . 
  until you find who did it and why , you ca n't just be so sure that the ` revolutionaries ' did it and consequently discredit the whole euromaidan movement ( which is what the op is trying to do here ) . 
  without proof you could just as easily accuse the russians . 
   democracy has nothing to do with peoples fundamental rights . 
  it 's the exact opposite - ** they can be removed in a democratic way . 
  ** wrong , if that happens it 's called tyranny of the majority , which is not democratic . 
  but i do n't get it , why do n't you just move to north korea ? 
  the supreme leader will decide what 's good and what 's wrong , you wo n't have to worry about anything . 
  no , that 's not democracy . 
  because it goes against her rights . 
  see , democracy is n't only about being able to vote , but it also helps to protect peoples ' fundamental rights . 
  but it would all be better if one person gets to decide everything , would n't it ? 
   europe of freedom and democracy ( the least bad , because they are anti-eu , ** but sadly also democratic . 
  ** ) oh , so you prefer having no say at all in how things run in your country and in the union ? 
  but then , why do you even complain ? 
  why should anyone care about your opinion , especially those in power ? 
   `` global warming '' is a normal cycle , and happens every 800 years or so . 
  can you post links to at least 2-3 scientific studies that confirm that , or at least name such studies ? 
  oh , and some random fact about two armies hundreds of years ago is n't a source . 
  especially considering that global warming only started about 100 years ago . 
  i do n't think so . 
  if i remember correctly my geopolitics professor said that , as strange as it is , this book has n't been translated into english , even though it has an enormous impact on russia 's policies . 
  to be fair , the ukrainians are biased too . 
  after all , it 's their country we 're talking about . 
  however , i agree that / u/kistoul should provide some arguments to support the idea that crimea should join russia . 
  i know , that 's why i said that russia should n't have intervened militarily . 
  i think most of us agree that a referendum in crimea would be the best choice . 
  however , what most of us do n't agree with is russia 's military intervention and the total disrespect for ukrainian sovereignty reflected in their actions . 
  were n't yanukovych 's authorities the ones that started using lethal force against the protesters ? 
  if so , at that point , what do you expect people to do ? 
  go home ? 
  forget about it ?
