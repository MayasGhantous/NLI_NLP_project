  romanian has this feature too : doi ( m ) / dou\u0103 ( f ) and for ` one ' , as well : unu ( m ) / una ( f ) also , just like in the example you gave , when talking about the hour ( two o'clock ) , the feminine is generally preferred ( at least in standard romanian ) . 
  i 'll have you know that transylvania * is * in central europe !, 
  i 'm not really christian myself , as i do n't believe in the existence of the deity , but i appreciate a lot of what christianity stands for , among which most of its teachings . 
  hence when i see people use their alleged christian identity to support their racist and xenophobic views , it just makes me sick . 
  how does one reconcile their argument of christian identity in this case with an attitude of complete reluctance to help people in need ? 
  what does this chrstian identity even stand for and mean if such an important precept is ignored ? 
  is he immortal ?

  is this why my post regarding the cooperation between the romanian police and the schengen area has apparently been removed from the subreddit ? 
  i posted it hours before you made this change and it does n't even concern immigration or the refugee crisis specifically . 
  is this really necessary ? 
  i speak : * romanian * italian * english * german ( intermediate , learning ) * french ( basics ) i used to be able to speak basic : * latin * piemontese i can understand most of the other romance languages , especially if written . 
  i would like to learn : * hungarian * hebrew * norwegian, 
  why do you feel the need to insult him for his opinion ? 
  honest question . 
   french is understood and spoken by 24 % of the population no , it 's not . 
  maybe understood on a very superficial level if written . 
  almost never spoken . 
  it used to be the case , up to and including the interwar period , especially in wallachia and moldavia where it serverd as * lingua franca * among the intelligentsia , but it certainly is n't anymore . 
   that 's assuming you only use the us and romanian layouts . 
  yes , that 's true , it can get more annoying if you keep adding languages , but even then i still think it 's a good shortcut . 
  yeah , i do n't think i 've ever seen hotnews use diacritic marks . 
  also , even those that use diacritics often use the wrong ones . 
  you can switch between layouts using alt + shift on a pc . 
  it makes it very easy to use diacritics . 
  and i consider myself romanian too , just that i also consider myself transylvanian . 
  what 's so hard to understand ? 
  just that i do n't have a problem with the fact that some people might consider themselves romanians or transylvanians , or both , or none , etc. , yet you do , and you also think that opinions that do n't align perfectly with your own identity should n't be allowed . 
  that 's why i say that you 're an extremist . 
  if free speech in this country would ever be limited to what you , personally , agree with , then it should n't be surprising if people would want to leave . 
  you are an extremist , one who likes to shove their view of the world down other peoples ' throats . 
   completely undermining the statehood of the romanian republic by adopting a flag that does n't actually represent anyone officially is completely another . 
  how the hell does it undermine anything ? 
  and why does the simple fact that there is no current political-territorial entity named transylvania means that people can not identify with the flag ? 
  there are many flags that currently represent no extant country or region , yet we should n't forget about them . 
  you know that transylvania was an entity for much longer than romania has been ? 
   in the current geopolitical context , the chances of transylvania ever separating from romania again , without a major war against hungary , are null . 
  again , you imply that the simple flying of that flag means that the person doing so wishes for secession , and maybe unification with hungary . 
  that is false . 
  maybe few people do , but they 're not a majority . 
  and even then , they 're free to express their opinions . 
  `` let me tell you about your region and how bad things are between the varios ethic groups there . '', 
  this is the annoying attitude that i noticed mostly romanians that are not from transylvania have . 
  they tell you how you should hate your ( hungarian ) neighbour , that anyone who gets along should go to hungary . 
  newsflash : if you would actually meet transylvanian hungarians , you would find that they 're very much just normal people . 
  you would find that they 're not constantly obsessed with the fact that transylvania is part of romania . 
  you are the ones who just ca n't let it go and try to leave peacefully . 
  you like to incite tensions , just like the far-right people in hungary do . 
   moldova is already on its way to eu accession and our own institutions are far too centralized and incompetent to help it develop . 
  that 's one of the reasons i am somewhat in favour of the unification : the fact that it will make people realize that federalization is beneficial and -- i would say -- necessary , not just for the region that would be incorporated , but for the whole country . 
  i think the constituent states should be based on the historical regions . 
  of course , the unification should n't happen anytime soon , but only after moldova becomes somewhat more developed . 
  thanks . 
  i already decided that from now on i will include the word in the original script as well , along with the transliteration , so adding the ipa would make the map a bit too cluttered , although i do agree that it is a great idea . 
  anyway , it 's hard to find the ipa notation for a lot of the less widely spoken languages . 
  the pons site could help though , thanks for telling me about it . 
  so i ca n't promise anything right now , but maybe i will give it a try .

  some other croatians said that it should be * svjetlo * . 
  so , which one is it ? 
  i did look it up , it 's not like i just tried to guess the word . 
  apparently there was a mistake on wiktionary , which i used as the main reference . 
  it will be fixed soon and i 'll post the updated map in the comments . 
  thanks . 
  it will be corrected in the updated version which i will post later in the comments .

  yes , i only noticed it just now . 
  it seems that the program i used also coloured that language region even though i never even intended to show the persian word for it . 
  i will correct it later and maybe even add it . 
  corrected and updated version : http://i.imgur.com/xpuowxt.jpg . 
  if you do , do n't forget to also post on / r/etymologymaps . 
  you 're welcome . 
  you should also check out / r/etymologymaps . 
  my main reference was [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/ ) , where i found the form and etymology of the words for `` valley '' in various european languages . 
  i used [ mapmaker ] ( https://github.com/cainesap/mapmaker ) to quickly assign the words to each language on the svg template that comes with the program . 
  i then used [ inkscape ] ( https://inkscape.org/ ) to add the legend and export the image as png . 
  it 's not a pretentious or complex word and that 's the meaning that 's attributed the most to it , as far as i 've seen and heard . 
   it does n't have to in order to prove my point . 
  just a majority in a certain area and there you go : hillbilly provincialist tribalism . 
  or 50 % + 1 , just to be cynical . 
  well , i think there 's a difference between expats being a majority in some neighbourhood , maybe , and them being a majority in a sizeable region . 
   i think you meant to use another word than that one . 
  do you even know what that word means ? 
  'cause it does n't mean what you think it means in the context you 've written it . 
   here 's and adjective to use in the future and not mock yourself over lack of words to use : amalgamation . 
   `` sanctioned '' ... whoever reads that word either thinks the unionism happened at gunpoint or that you 're a nitwit that does n't know how , what & when to put words into context . 
   i mean it , change that goddamn word with ` amalgamated ' . 
  haralambie ... 
  i used the word in the sense of `` to authorize , approve , or allow '' not `` to impose a sanction on ; penalize , especially by way of discipline '' . 
  you know ... a word can have multiple meanings . 
  edit : changed `` minority '' to `` majority '' in the first sentence . 
  no , it 's not the same thing . 
  romanian expats do n't all live in the same area where they form a majority . 
  next you 're going to say that other distinct historical and cultural regions do n't actually exist and that they 've never existed : banat , transylvania , wallachia , moldavia , \u021aara mo\u021bilor , \u021aara oa\u0219ului , etc. 
  are those nonexistent as well ? 
  or do you think things only exist after they 've been sanctioned by the state ? 
  there 's no lie . 
  people have been calling it that for a long time . 
  the inhabitants there identify as sz\u00e9kelys or sz\u00e9kely hungarian , [ and there are numerous toponyms derived from their ethnonym ] ( https://arnoldplaton.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/localitati-cu-nume-secuiesti/ ) .
