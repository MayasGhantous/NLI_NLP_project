i found a russia today ( i know ... ) english article http://rt.com/politics/268804-russia-bill-nazi-collaborators/ to be sure i also found the source they are quoting ( link in russian ) http://izvestia.ru/news/587953, 
  so i googled his name to see if he looks like a bond villain ( he does ) and then i see this picture http://i.imgur.com/lbzplhf.jpg that is a bmw motorcycle, 
  nissan aprio and lada largus . 
  you will find their looks very famiiliar, 
  so this is why there is all that horse riding on eurosport, 
  yeah it is . 
  consent laws are to protect minors so a 17 year old wo n't go to jail for sleeping with 15 or 16 . 
  a 18 year old wo n't go to jail if they have sex with a 16 year old either . 
  we have a 3 year ( 36 months ) limit . 
  if you are 20 + you are going to jail, 
  came here for this . 
  not dissapointed, 
   wow , lucky me there are literally 6 billion people that have it worse than you, 
  jesus fuck some people . 
  some of you idiots never realize how lucky you are to live here, 
  the daughters move in with their husbands duh !, 
  but those husbands live with their mothers ? 
  yeah it 's judet . 
  well jude\u021b ( \u021b = tz ) \u021a is a special character so my guess that ? 
  is because the site did n't recognize it, 
  also in our case it was harder to get tertiary education . 
  now we have diploma mills universities and i expect the % to increase . 
  ca n't wait for more stupid people with diplomas . 
  do not get me wrong in the past there are not so few who somehow managed to get a diploma and be dumb as a rock but now that number will increase, 
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/behind_the_overlay/ or https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/behindtheoverlay/ljipkdpcjbmhkdjjmbbaggebcednbbme very useful, 
  and that is on top of the military spending usa does for all that ** free ** healthcare europe has, 
  if only poland had guns . 
  they could have opposed nazi germany and the soviet union, 
  it how you would say coup from coup d'etat, 
  the russians did n't come because of the coanda 's super duper laser, 
  yeah the last booing at this level i remember was in greece against paul hamm at gymnastics . 
  but that was daylight robbery, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  there are no russian troops in crimeea, 
   and udmr will join them oh fuck off edit : also til technocacatii are actually good, 
  i think that is a reaction to the dna arrests . 
  if those percentages were about your typical garcea they would be different, 
  the bad history is the one you guys are being thought in your russian schools sure romania joined the axis specifically to fight against russia but you know in 1944 they were greated as libertators . 
  ok then, 
  you made me curious that snopes articles is quoting la times . 
  every other article i can find regarding that also quotes la times . 
  the other newspapers that are n't quoting la times are part of tronc who owns la times . 
  molly hennessy-fiske from la times quotes 2 fbi sources . 
  either way i give up, 
  so he did n't frequent the club ? 
  because he did, 
  do you know [ j-five ft charlie chaplin modern times ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxqj-r7z0kw ) . 
  at one time you think they speak in romanian ( sounds like : ce mandre sunt ... ) but you ca n't quite get it ... it was made up language for the song, 
  see you know when you are arguing with stupid when they attack your nationality * when that has got no relevance . 
  so no i do not think you are racist ... * or race or sex or age or other irelevant shit like that, 
  i understand how it works . 
  what you are describing is simply not a democracy . 
  i am not saying it is a better or worse system , just that it is not a democracy because in a democracy presidents ( or the person in charge ) are not elected with less than 50 % of the vote, 
  no , people voted for his party . 
  democracy is when you actually vote for the guy in charge . 
  not one person in the uk voted for cameron, 
  so that is why old people fall for scams more easily !, 
  they grow wiser and wiser, 
  valcea is special . 
  if you do not have problems with the law you are not mayor material here . 
  he is not sentenced . 
  he is indicted for now . 
  not saying this makes it better but he could n't be mayor if he was already sentenced . 
  if he is sentenced in these 4 years he will lose his place . 
  considering the justice system he could be able to serve out his term before he is convicted . 
  but he will be convicted ... there is no way he can get away with it, 
  it says so much about germany 's football youth system . 
  germany has produced better turkish players ( 3 million population ) than turkey ( 80 million ), 
  you guys are orthodox right ? 
  honestly how are the romanians ? 
  there are some socilaist policies that are still beneficial to this country . 
  who made mayo without eggs ? 
  ha we talked about that . 
  rice is poor people food apparently, 
  that seemed rude ? 
  what i meant by that was to say how simmilar our cooking is ps in my job i spoke with lots of foreigners . 
  white cheese is not something they use . 
  they did n't even knew the word in their native language i did discover that the swedes have something close to the sarma though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarma_ ( food ) kaldomar, 
  oh god we are the same . 
  it 's like we are neighbours or something, 
  you mash a bunch of garlic with cooking oil and salt . 
  [ even kids can do it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abmmvdtmwcm ) then at the end you add ~ ~ whipping cream ( i hope that is the correct english word ) ~ ~ not the sweet kind . 
  edit : the correct word is sourcream . 
  some people add yogurt instead . 
  the normal receipe is with dill . 
  i hate dill you do not need to be master chef . 
  i know how to make 6 things and 2 of them are mayonase and garlic cream, 
  in 1998 our national football team ate more bread than the entire french hotel they were at . 
  the chefs there said they had to buy bread for our compatriots, 
  i am pretty sure we are numba one !, 
  at abortions in europe, 
   this country lives off of seasonal work in the eu and western union/moneygram paychecks . 
  no it fucking does n't . 
  god i hate the `` diaspora salveaza ( saves ) romania '' people, 
  rakija means rachiu in romania ( thank you wiki ) . 
  it 's a more loose term . 
  vodka is rachiu for example . 
  regional differences aside palinca is double refined fruit rachiu . 
  all palinca is rachiu but all rachiu is not palinca,
