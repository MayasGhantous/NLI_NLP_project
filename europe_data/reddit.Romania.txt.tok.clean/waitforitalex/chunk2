  wat is your opinion of palinka ? 
  ( i think that is how they write it ) we and hungarians have it in common . 
  palinca for us . 
  i had people from different nationalities try it and it 's an even split between those who like it or hate it . 
  nah it 's done . 
  there is a reason they tried this via emergency decree before parliament began their mandate, 
  you watch more rtv and a3 more than me believe me . 
  honestly it is ironic . 
  people like you who know a3 and rtv are saying know because you are actually watching . 
  i have no clue really and btw if you are so easily influenced by what you see on tv it does n't mean everyone is the same ps let me guess . 
  you do not even live in romania ? 
   are you defending what psd is doing ? 
  but when people were protesting basescu in the streets they were crazy idiots . 
  now the people in the streets are a bunch of patriots, 
   they won the elections by manipulating people unlike which party ? 
  let us remember basescu won an election on the 16 % universal tax promise . 
  the majority of the people were already taxed that and poor people were taxed even lower but they still voted based on that . 
  ponta was responsible for a club fire too many young people did n't vote in other elections either and statistically parliamentary elections have had low turnouts for years . 
  listen i agree in my opinion voting should be mandatory but i am tired of seeing `` they won because few people voted '' . 
  not now i mean is it said all the time . 
  if pnl and usr won i doubt you would have had the same speech . 
  it 's funny how voting is important now . 
  it was n't when basescu was impeached, 
  the planner ( ? ), 
  the project designer ? 
  i do n't know the proper name . 
  the project was badly made so until they remade it they could n't start . 
  december 2015 was the deadline . 
  my town rm valcea received mutiple eu grants to modernize downtown . 
  98 % eu funds , 2 % local money . 
  guess which town must now pay 80 % of the bill because they did n't finish on time . 
  12 fucking million euros, 
   because apparently there 's so few black actors in romania . 
  his name is cabral, 
   i do n't expect the government to pay my pension even if my contribution is 2-3 times higher than average contributions . 
  that 's why i 'll live off my savings when i 'll retire . 
  if you will save enough to live off another 20 + years good for you . 
  not many will be in your position and will want to be compensated accordingly becasue plenty will have lower pensions than they deserve the peasant demanding a bigger pension is not the one drainig the system the pension system is broken due to the judges , aviation and the army + police but that is another discussion . 
  edit : how could i forget the many special pensions that our representatives have voted for . 
   it 's kinda unfair to pay the pensions for baby boomers , especially when the working population is leaving the country . 
  it is n't . 
  this logic will be used against us in the future . 
  i am sure there are plenty who made this country worse but most of them were victims too  i never was a mod on softpedia . 
  probably a username coincidence ? 
  well the guy is fumator ** ul ** so yeah ca n't stand the guy, 
   did they ever had decent salaries and contributions in order to have now decent pensions ? 
  should i remind you that we had oranges and bananas only on christmas ? 
  ** do you have any idea what their purchasing power was back then ? 
  ** so what they should be punished today ? 
  btw softpedia is more enjoyable now without you as moderator, 
  so is johannis in the same boat . 
  he did n't have time either ? 
  it 's not about bragging btw . 
  tell me what exactly did he do, 
  man i hope younger people wo n't talk shit about us when we are old . 
  fucking lazy fuckers ... look at them they want decent pensions boooo, 
  something . 
  anything . 
  he did nothing, 
  the final results will look like psd ~ 44-45 % + alde ~ 6 % = will be above 50 % even if the real results will be below this due to redistribution pnl ~ 20 % ( romanian right ) usr ~ 10 ( new party will ally themselves with pnl ) udmr above 5 % surely ; hungarian party ( they said they want to join psd + alde ) pmp ( basescu 's party ) around ~ 5 % most likely to be above, 
  google '' [ country ] population map density '' tell us how many you see where red means higher density . 
  then let 's see if you consider to be in the right . 
  i waited like 3 minutes to vote . 
  in that time 2 people made the `` can i keep the tablet after voting '' joke . 
  the voting is between 7 am - 21 pm . 
  the people there must be thrilled to hear that original joke over and over, 
  edit : the reason why i am voted is because of my opinion on the diaspora . 
  reddit is filled with diaspora people . 
  that is why i do not even go on r/romania sure why not . 
  i am sure the takedown of my logic was amazing but nah i also tried to respond to your post but i wrote that instead . 
  in order to be upvoted i need to say ciolos is great , pnl amazing and psd is corrupt . 
  sure he did shit and pnl is as corrupt as psd but what do i know compared to fuckers who left the country . 
  i only criticize because of the inferiority complex i have . 
  you guys know better . 
  just like when people like you saved romania by voting basescu . 
  he was great . 
  sure he was president 10 years but everything bad was psd 's fault, 
   i do n't want to dismiss your concerns but it is pretty obvious you have very little real knowledge about what you 're talking about . 
  i know more than you because i actualy live here  at the presidential elections the place of residence should n't be an issue . 
  well your guys cry so much about people who voted in multiple places . 
  you know voting turism that you hate so much . 
  which i agree btw . 
  voting turism would n't be possible if the only place you could vote was what it 's written in the buletin ( national id ) . 
  or register way before the vote . 
  but if they did that they would be accused of rigging the system  i think your comments about the smugness of romanians abroad and the false claim about `` special privileges '' has more to do with your own feelings of inferiority exactly . 
  if you dare critize it it 's because of ones feeling of inferiority . 
  diaspora salveaza ( english for saves ) romania . 
  never heard that one . 
  i also do not hear abot how the money from diaspora saved the economy . 
   regarding the pension , do n't worry , as long as we pay into a pension system in the place were we live and work that 's where we 'll get the retirement money from . 
  ** nobody will ask ** for money from the romanian pension system as long as they worked and contributed legally in italy or germany . 
  of course they will . 
  because plenty of you wo n't have the years required to get the pension from those countries . 
  and you know that because you made sure to write '' as long as we pay into a pension system '' and `` contributed legally '' because you know plenty wo n't have the years . 
  but that wo n't stop them from asking and they will vote for psd when that time comes because they will promise them pensions, 
  you can vote in the place that it says on your buletin . 
  also when you leave in a foreign place you should say where exactly you are not expect the electoral bureau to know you went to ibiza spain and they should be expecting you . 
  because all the queues also happened because people were n't registered . 
  you guys are the ones who want to vote via sms . 
  ** so yeah i think you are expecting special priviliges not to mention the smug attitute when we are told that romanians in other countries ( diaspora ) are saving romania .
