  our `` dick '' word , pula , is a national currency in botswana , a river in ecuador , a beautiful city in croatia ( near the place that airplane was diverted from ) , a village in hungary , and two in italy ( one of which sounds extremly funny : santa margherita di pula-saint margherita of the dick ), 
  i do n't want pure socialism . 
  i want a change and some political options . 
  so the red neo-liberals have chance to win ? 
  great !, 
  i ca n't wait for the exact same shit . 
  am i the only one who thinks this entire swiss problem is the svp trying to influence the mep elections ? 
  as a total , statistically is richer . 
  but you know how it is , there are lies , big lies , huge lies and statistical lies . 
   today 's africa would have been seen as rich and not africa . 
  africa as it was 150 years ago was n't seen as rich by a guy who lived 150 years ago . 
  but africa of 2014 would be seen as rich by a guy who lived 150 years ago . 
  today 's africa would have been seen as rich and not africa . 
  3.5 is very little for a country that wants to develop . 
  that 's a developed country normal growth . 
  also , strong agricultural output means if this year it does n't rain enough we are back where we started with our growth because our agriculture is medieval ( pray to god that it rains because we do n't have irrigation systems ) . 
  i would n't say it 's great news . 
  until i see a  6 % growth and feel it like it felt in 2008 and 2007 i 'd would n't say the crisis is over . 
  no one gets my username . 
  it 's meant to mean to be what the fuck with an eastern european accent which is close to waterfuck . 
  i hate that title with all my guts . 
  the poor guy had a collection ... at least he should talk to the police so that they can open a museum of weapons with what he had . 
  weapons dating back from the 1600 . 
  you know guys , he may have a lot of freedom in turkey ... he has the freedom to do anything . 
  it means something like confidence , trust , belief that you 'll realize something , belief in someone and also hope . 
  i like the word because it is n't used anymore and it makes it sound a lot more profound than the preferred modern counterpart '' \u00eencredere '' ( to believe in something - crede ( believe ) `` in `` crede ) . 
  it 's something different when you say to someone '' \u00eemi pun n\u0103dejdea \u00een tine '' ( i put my confidence in you ) than the preferred today version `` am \u00eencredere \u00een tine '' ( i believe in you ) . 
  it may be because the only place you would normally find this expression is in old literature books and old people 's language . 
  i think i 'm actually in love with old people language before all these french , latin , english etc. 
  borrowed words became so common . 
  i mean people used to speak so nice but that 's only my opinion , whenever i drop some old fashioned word in a sentence people sometimes look at me like i 've took the conversation to a high level they are not comfortable with . 
  or if i drop a regionalism word like i 'm a peasant . 
  regionalism - ( that 's what we call words used only in some parts of the country , usually still used by old people in the countryside ), 
  the coolest one from what i 've visited is amsterdam . 
  it was the youngest , most dynamic city i 've seen in europe . 
  but then again i have n't seen berlin and london and that may influence my decision . 
  i think that the next art capital of the world will be either amsterdam or berlin . 
  paris is dead in the water and new york is dying . 
  and i 've never seen so much dynamism as i 've seen in amsterdam . 
  yeah but you know in our central-balkan region ethnicity is such a useless word sometimes . 
  you can have a guy named horvath play in the romanian national football team and say he 's a romanian , in the hungarian football team and say he 's a hungarian or in the croatian football team an say , maybe the most rightfully , that he 's croatian . 
  yes , some of them recognize their ethnicity and that 's how we say who 's what but it does n't really matter at the end . 
  but i would n't call the gypsies , the hungarians and the saxons immigrants . 
  serbia was yogoslavia, 
  statistically the poverty was a lot like in north korea but the difference was that in romania you were able and it was tolerated by the party to produce food at home . 
  for example to have a pig which you cut and eat on christmas like it 's our tradition and stuff . 
  and usually the workers in the cities had their parents living in villages and having animals and stuff like a lot of these people still have now . 
  so i would n't say there was a famine in romania during ceausescu but it sucked nonetheless, 
  now i start thinking about the guys who swam the danube into yugoslavia to escape ceausescu . 
  that would 've been hard . 
  i was n't criticizing the eu for imposing some restrictions on the swiss as it does not respect ghe treaties it signed . 
  i was only criticizing the / r/europe userbase which can be very hypocritical at times . 
  i like how some users here who said when the merkel report on romanian and bulgarian migrants came out that the report is so positive about the romanian and bulgarians because they follow only the interests of westerner employer and not westerner employee and that the romgarian immigrants are bad for the job market . 
  i also like how some of those users said here that `` hey swiss , if the market is free , the job market should also be free '' . 
  keep up the hypocrisy / r/europe , it suits you well . 
  and also , i 'm a big europhile but if the people of a country vote against the eu they should be respected not like we did with lisabon where the people were treated like in the soviet union : `` if the people do n't want it there 's something wrong with the people and not with our brilliant party '' . 
  in this thread i see only people saying '' fuck them we do n't care , they are small and unimportant , we should fuck them in the ass so they learn how to vote next time '' which is n't a very * european * attitude imo . 
  that 's like a 5 min of a good drive . 
  and it 's filled with tourists, 
  yeah , in biology i learned biology if i think about it but nobody put it in contradiction with religion . 
  we learned evolution , did n't call it that way , everything was fine . 
  after that i went to france and there my science teacher was an absolute beast . 
  he taught us everything about evolution and at the end when everything was understood and logical he said : this is the theory of evolution which came as quite a shock to anyone who wanted to debate it at first . 
  i do n't think there are any important creationist organizations in romania other than the romanian orthodox church ( bor ) but creationism is widespread in romania . 
  it has to do with us being a very superstitious country but what 's interesting about romanian creationism is that , like many other things in romania , it 's basically a joke . 
  everybody believes in creationism but nobody really believes in creationism and at the end nobody really cares . 
  when i was in school i remember talking about creationism but not in biology class ( we had a stupid teacher who did n't know how to teach ) but in geography where i had a brilliant teacher . 
  and the general tendency was , you know , nobody really knows , the fossils are fake , the bible does n't really sound right , it 's a debate and that 's all . 
  in religion classes i had first a teacher who believed in god and all that but did n't really care about the classes because he thought that religion should n't be taught in schools so we all had the mark 10 ( the highest ) and nobody cared . 
  and after that i had a teacher when i was in high school which tried to tell us that creationism is the only way but everybody was making fun of her with stuff `` god says we should n't pray to idols , are n't religious objects idols ? '', 
  or did n't really care and had the mark 10 . 
  if i think about it the majority of people from these schools are creationists now because of some sort of superstition ( if you do n't believe in god he will beat you [ that 's literally how we say in romanian ] ) but they only way that 's affecting society is that sometimes the priests blackmail people into giving money . 
  and the american style neo-protestant loud creationists are seen as nutjobs my the large silent majority . 
  if anyone wants to come to romania to find an even better one i warn you these 2 are the only ones . 
  yes but in romania the printed press is dead , contrary to the uk one which is dying ours is in really close to being dissconected totally from life support . 
  the newspaper that started this campaign for example became online only because nobody was buying the printed version and it was n't some hipster newspaper , it was and it is one of the mainstream ones . 
  i have n't seen a printed , mainstream newspaper with more than 10 pages since 2007 because it 's too expensive to print more and people do n't buy it . 
  yes . 
  not political or serious news , but there are a lot of shitty articles from the daily mail about paranormal stuff and shit like that . 
  if the daily mail does n't give the dose of superstitions they come with the beautiful phrase : `` the british researchers '' or `` the american researchers '' which is every radio station/newspaper excuse to fill up the time with useless information like `` the british researchers found out that having sex doggy style you can reduce the risk of ass cancer '' . 
  because is not totalitarian policing and it 's not secret . 
   all are problems are from communism 100 % nope . 
  this is stupid and disrespectful of an entire generation of people who had the `` luck '' to be born during the communist regime . 
  if you look at the communist regime and its history you 'll find out that after the soviet occupation the regime started to get a much more romanian and less sovietic . 
  the period of ceausescu is called by some historians ( and i really like the term ) national-communism , like a derivative of the national-socialism of hitler . 
  why ? 
  because it had a lot of elements of the 30 's romanian fascism which was the beautiful product of your idealized interwar period . 
  the problems i talk about can be found at the begging of the romanian project of a national state . 
  read about junimea 's ideas of `` forms without substance '' `` before we had any village teachers , we created village schools , and before we had any professors , we opened universities , and [ thus ] we falsified public instruction . 
  before we had a culture outside of the schools , we created the romanian atheneum and cultural associations , and we despised the spirit of the literary societies . 
  before we had even a shade of original scientific activity , we created the romanian academic society , with philological , historical-archaeological , natural sciences departments , and we falsified the idea of an academy . 
  before we had any notable artists , we created the music conservatory ; before we had a single worthy painter , we created the fine art schools ; before we had a single valuable play , we founded the national theatre , and we devalued and falsified all these forms of culture . 
  romania the same big meaningless names of problems : corruption , bad organization , bad everything , stupid people . 
  i claim the problem is more profound than that and the problem is the way the country is founded . 
  from the founding fathers myth ( emperor trajan and decebal ) to the way the country is organized around which principles and how are this principles put into practice here . 
  i think romania 's problem , in a very simplistic way of saying , is that we just took raw principles from the west and put them in practice here without any adaptation to the local context and we are still doing that now . 
  damn oltenian , promoting only themselves . 
  :d here are some other beautiful cities that maybe deserve a visit .
