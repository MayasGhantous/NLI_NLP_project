  why the hell is it secret ? 
  i take it as some classic british eu-bashing . 
  i like how the press functions these days . 
  you ca n't simply tell the truth about something . 
  you have to take one side of the coin and explain it . 
  if some guy is saying the nordics are the gods the other guy has to say they are demons but no one has the guts to say that they are just normal human being . 
  so you mention the blogs which demonstrated that what the daily mail did was lying and then you just take the same arguments , write them down again , give it a different title and you get your article . 
  way to go !, 
  the romanian one might as well be considered austrian because it was discovered in transylvania when transylvania was part of the austrian empire and also , it was discovered by an austrian ( the place of birth is controversial , he might have been transylvanian saxon ), 
  i 'm the living stereotype that transylvanian romanians are slow and do n't get the jokes . 
  :d i thought it 's a romanian name from chernivtsi or something that was `` ukrainized '' because a lot of names end in ` escu in romania ... look at our presidents since ceausescu : iliescu , constantinescu , basescu . 
  do you know what 's the most european value that europeans have for me . 
  the fact that they 've learned throughout their bloody history that small differences do n't matter in the common struggle for freedom and equality . 
  and in this sense the bosnians , the serbs or the ukrainians that you 've colored here in a very xenophobic way in red are more european than you . 
  if today , the european values are in danger , is because of you and your xenophobic and maybe racist ideas about some people and not because of the poorer countries who aspire at those values but more or less have n't reached them yet . 
  i 'm sorry to tell you , as a leftist myself ( probably people would label me that ) that your comment here for me looks like some sort of leftist paranoia : yes there is a revolution in ukraine but `` mefiez-vous '' they are fascist infiltrated so we should n't look at it so nicely . 
  my friend , let me tell you as a eastern european now that this is n't your wet dream revolution . 
  this is just a big fuck you to corrupt politicians and the result of almost no confidence in the institutions of the state . 
  it 's normal for extreme right wingers to be a part of such a protest in eastern europe because in countries that do n't work , the last justification for some people to still follow that country and see themselves as citizens is extreme right mythology . 
  it 's sad but true . 
  at least the us states have some legislative power . 
  this guy has no legislative power constitutionally but he assumes some right now . 
  not applying the law , that 's quite a statement . 
  is n't that very close to declaring independence ? 
  i 'm not criticizing the policemen there but the police as a part of the government and yes you could say that basically the government is to blame for the violence . 
  i really hate this `` syrian civil war '' logic here ( assad is bad but al quaeda on the rebel side is just as bad ) . 
  i do n't want to say the protesters here are saints that only defend themselves but this is still a normal and natural reaction from a mass of protesters , the problem here is not that the protesters are violent but that the police , whom actual job is to prevent that the protesters do n't turn violent , is violent . 
  this is n't about comparing ( in this american logic about syria ) who is more bad than the other by comparing in some almost mathematical way the violence of both sides and their means of screwing each other over so that we help the least powerful so there 's a fair fight . 
  what we have here are to sides which are both bad because both of them are violent . 
  but nevertheless one side is guilty , and that 's the police , because it was their job that this moment is n't reached . 
  i ca n't wait for the time european english will appear . 
  it would be the strangest dialect of english with a lot of french , german , italian etc. 
  words in it . 
  like ciao , we all use ciao in europe or servus in central europe . 
  what 's sad is not that they have a pathetic go at `` we are the good guys , they are the bad guys '' style of propaganda bu that they have a basis on which to build that propaganda . 
  of course most of it are lies but the problems exist at a basic level . 
  mass surveillance , torture , xenophobia exist in our societies and becoming all defensive in front of this attempt of propaganda and saying `` you russians are the worst and should n't be talking about this '' instead of saying `` why are we accepting things like this and how can we change them so in the future '' is the wrong way to see this . 
  i think this should be seen as a distorted mirror put in front of ourselves . 
  we may like some traits we see in this mirror ( gay loving ) but we should n't ignore the bad traits we see in there just because the guy who put the mirror in front of us is even uglier than us . 
  at first i thought that the money is kept in a bag by the state so it 's not lost in bad investments that 's would be a bad move . 
  i read now somewhere that norway is one of the biggest holder of capital in the world . 
  i think that 's where the money is . 
  i know that you keep all of that money in a fund . 
  how do you deal with inflation ? 
  what if before you decide that the oil is gone and it 's time to start spending that money a huge inflation comes and all of that money becomes toilet paper ? 
  1 . acquire catnip 2 . put them in a cage 3 . drive them far away ( 4 . in the eventuality of you living in a civilized country call animal control or just send them to a ngo that finds homes for abandoned animals and tell them they are strays and you saved them . ), 
  if this did n't solve the problem 1 . acquire catnip 2 . put them in a cage 3 . take them to a vet to put them down do n't poison the suns of bitches , it 's not a human thing to do . 
  i was in basel during the euro 2012 , there 's a great portugese and an italian community there that will make you enjoy the game like it 's on the stadium . 
  germany-italy was quite an experience . 
  urma [ you can buy me with a coffe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob1qhqeypm8 ) [ all wrong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbej9s_eml4 ) [ cine iubeste si lasa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqj0mwwwq4 ) ( my personal favorite ), 
  you also have those asshole neighbors that poison others pets because they took a piss on the flowers they planted in the front of the block of flats which by the way is public space . 
  i know the kind . 
  the stupid , lazy peasants that were the joke of the village before the communist regimes moved them to the cities where they think they are better than anyone else . 
  they are the scum of the earth . 
  [ dacia 1100 ] ( http://www.romaniancars.ro/sites/default/files/romaniancars%20files/dacia-1100.jpg ) is not to be forgotten . 
  also , [ dacia 1310 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/mhv_dacia_1310_estate_01.jpg ) needs to be on that list . 
  also the evergreen [ aro ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/aro_romania.jpg ) and let 's not forget the truck that cut your breath ( because of the thick black smoke that it left behind ) [ roman ] ( http://images02.olx.ro/ui/15/29/12/1317200880_257482712_2-camion-roman-raba-cluj-napoca.jpg ), 
  yep it is . 
  dacia was renault based since the beginning that 's why renault bought it after and made the logan and sandero . 
  austro-hungarian traditions do n't die easily . 
  evolution does n't `` think '' . 
  if the big fish with big fish genes reproduced because it was thrown back into the ocean when he was small and fished only after he made baby fishes with big fish genes nothing will evolve to become smaller because evolution `` thinks '' that how they survive . 
  `` transyvanian '' is n't considered a romanian dialect because is very similar to romanian but there are some differences . 
  also , is only spoken in northern transylvania above the tarnava mare river . 
  we say `` no '' which is an interjection that basically means everything . 
  ( it 's not a negation ) . 
  it can mean `` so '' sometimes . 
  `` ni '' which means `` look ! '', 
  and it 's `` uite ! '', 
  in romanian . 
  i am is `` eu sunt '' in romanian but `` io \u00ees '' in transylvania . 
  he is is el e ( romanian ) but el \u00eei ( transylvania ) . 
  to go is `` a merge '' in romanian but a mere in transylvania ( yet at first person is the same conjugation `` eu merg '' in both at the second person a guy from bucharest would say `` tu mergi '' a guy from cluj would say `` tu meri '' . ) . 
  to eat is also conjugated differently ( eu m\u00e2n\u00e2nc / eu m\u00e2nc , el m\u00e2n\u00e2nc\u0103 / el m\u00e2nc\u0103 ) . 
  bread also has a different transylvanian cousin in romanian pit\u0103 instead of the correct p\u00e2ine . 
  musai is must in transylvania and in romanian is trebuie but we usually use trebuie or tre in transylvania . 
  some regional words that mostly old people still use like '' f\u0103g\u0103d\u0103u '' for bar , `` c\u0103tan\u0103 '' for soldier etc. 
  some words we use differently i 've discovered because of my friends from the south like bathtub ( van\u0103 for me and cad\u0103 for them ) , swing ( hint\u0103 for me and leag\u0103n for them ) and a few more . 
  and of course the accent , we have sounds which do n't exist in romanian like the french \u00e8 when it 's a romanian e at the end of a word or a `` ea '' at the end of a word and a strange o ( which i think is found in hungarian but i do n't know which one is it because hungarian has too many o 's ) instead of the romanian combination oa which should be read in romanian o a. ni is also read strangely a bit like in hungarian . 
  i really want to help them but i ca n't find any baltic products in any supermarket . 
  but the conservatives want to get rid of immigrants ` couse they took their juuuaabb . 
  i do n't think they will do anything concrete anti immigrants and will maybe become the 1st economy in europe . 
  not without immigrants you wont . 
  you need a population boom to achieve that goal and i do n't see it coming from more babies . 
  man , that country is awesome . 
  rotterdam , after a life of living in cities with old 2-3-4 stories building seeing skyscrapers was quite a culture sock . 
  do n't feel bad . 
  the most recent swedish history i know is when you switched driving sides in 60 something . 
  i do n't think so ... 
  i ca n't think of any jokes about southern transylvania . 
  there are jokes about transylvanians but they are more about the slow and calm northern transylvanians . 
  or the one when the hungarians first arrived in transylvania they found a beautiful empty land . 
  they left their horses to go and drink water and when they came back they found a ticket that said `` thank you for the horse '' which works on the stereotype about romanians that they are thieves and makes more fun of romanians than of hungarians . 
  even if it makes fun of hungarian nationalism . 
  but there are also anti romanian nationalism jokes like when ceausescu went in a visit in szekelyfold he asked a kid - what your name , son of a the dacian people ? 
  we also have this in romania . 
  [ ada milea - ceausescu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v2n29mlxro ) translation ceausescu is n't dead , he 's watching over us ceausescu is a school ceausescu is a disease he 's in me and he 's in you he 's in blocks and factories today everybody carries him ceausescu never dies ceausescu is n't dead , history has tricked us his wooden language is walking slowly trough our old language we are the living and the dead !, 
  ceausesti we are all . 
  young people not getting jobs is n't a immigration problem . 
  young romanians have the exact same problem with the lack of experience .
