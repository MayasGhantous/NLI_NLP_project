  the blood of prunes ... before and after every meal or task . 
  i was looking here and i thought : well our are n't that bad , they are simplistic but not that bad . 
  so i did a search on google to find our if we had any funny ones in romania . 
  boy was i wrong . 
  here [ try it with a woman too ] ( http://imgur.com/vht435p ) is what it says there . 
  vote change !, 
  neagu florin mihail [ the man who brings the rain , well being and prosperity in your house ] ( http://imgur.com/dosf09q ) ( i really do n't want it to rain in my house ) and to end it our to favorites candidates for mayors in to different villages [ vasile laba and muia marcel ] ( http://imgur.com/ujqlmd6 ) i feel bad making fun of their names but they roughly translate into : vasile handjob and blowjob marcel . 
  * transylvanians * are proud is what i wrote there . 
  this is what i could find in my head beautiful and close to vienna . 
  it is actually very good wine , and the vodka is just the best i have ever tasted . 
  also cheap as hell ( not really because of european taxes but i think it 's still cheaper than anything produced in the ue ), 
  the guys working in money printing factories ? 
  i personally think that the actual problem is `` no industry '' . 
  in school they teach history from the national-communist era o ceausescu : nationalistic , badly documented and very romantic . 
  in schools you 're taught that history was like this and that 's it . 
  not how to study documents , how to understand different opinions over a matter and finally to understand an event from your personal point of view and not a nationalistic one . 
  but hey , romania is a poor country . 
  without the indoctrination of its people that everything around us ( turks , hungarians , russians ) is trying to kill us it would n't be so united . 
  if you look at it , the biggest problems romania has are in its organization and that includes its territorial organization `` but how can we make big strong regions based on the historical regions when the hungarians eat our babies '' and national unity is under assault . 
  i split europe in 3 ways : by their recent past : the iron curtain splits it in east and west . 
  geographically : i personally prefer : * france , uk , ireland , belgium and holland in the west * spain , portugal , italy , greece , bulgaria and the former yugoslavs in the south * romania , hungary , slovakia , czech republic , germany , austria , switzerland and poland in central europe * finland , sweden , denmark and norway in northern europe and * russia , estonia , latvia , lithuania , belarus , ukraine , moldova in eastern europe and then there is the 3rd way i split europe which is culturally but is more of a historical split because some of the mentalities that i use to make this are basically lost in the modern countries of today . 
  ok , this is my opinion and i 'm not willing to offend anybody please do n't downvote me or kill me or whatever . 
  i 'll also put a little why . 
  so here it goes : * france and the uk+i reland in the west ( because they both had colonies `` recently '' with which that still have strong ties ) * spain and portugal in the south west ( because they both had colonies before the french and the brits and they are n't so attached to them ) * italy in the south ( you 're all alone :( because you 're quite strange if you look at it ) * greece , bulgaria , fyrom , serbia , albania , wallachia in the south east ( they all have a ottoman past and history even if some of them are more influenced by it than others ) * czech republic , slovakia , hungary , transylvania , slovenia , croatia , austria , tirol , galicia in the center south . 
  ( yep , the austrian empire , well that empire was at least 100 years of this regions history , and some quite recent history too . 
  you can find architectural things in common in almost all the big cities of these countries + some common things like the hungarian playing cards and stuff ) maybe poland here too , i have n't worked that out yet . 
  * germany in the center north ( germany , you 're like italy but in the north ) * norway , finland , sweden , denmark in the north ( so much history in common ) * russia , some ukraine , belarus , moldova in the east . 
  ( die hard orthodox countries ) * maybe make a region for all the left out countries but i 'm not sure about it : poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia . 
  start shitting on me nationalists . 
  of course romania is the most split up country because i know the differences between the regions better but i could split other countries up just as well ( like the uk , spain , france , germany or italy ) but i have n't quite got the big cultural differences between your regions . 
  like why are the guys from marseille saying they do n't like the north or what 's the big difference between a northern german and a southern one . 
  coop is not a local chain , is swiss and everywhere in switzerland . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coop_ ( switzerland ), 
  shitty translation and romanian pessimism ( for a romanian everything romanian is bad and stupid ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de%c8%99teapt%c4%83-te,_rom%c3%a2ne !, 
  ) you 'll find a more poetic translation which is closer to what you would hear in romanian . 
  i like my national anthem . 
  they do n't walk to germany . 
  cluj-luton is 50 euros if you get it in time . 
  steal a phone , sell it , you 're in the uk . 
  germany has the same restrictions towards romania as the uk has . 
  and germany will also be lifting them in 2014 . 
  it 's not the restrictions that are stopping them , is that your shitty country 's not worth the effort . 
  all the `` romanians are going to invade us '' episode plus some shows i watched . 
  of course , not every news piece of show you have there are bad but some are simply terrible . 
  exemple no1 . 
  romania : great idea badly made . 
  uk : more arrogant than the french . 
  ( your media not your people ), 
  even better beer . 
  not this again . 
  i know your country is fucked up but there is no reason to blame two poor countries who ca n't defend themselves so your politicians get away with it . 
  grow up , britain . 
  i lived there for 3 months . 
  a very small country in which beauty is concentrated in every square mile . 
  maribor is a great city to live in , ljubjana is an awesome city , bled is breathtaking , celje is the best place on earth and koper is the best experience i had on the seaside so far . 
  and the best part about this is that you can do all these locations by bike :d i 'm romanian so the only thing i 'm not used with is the calmness that everybody has there . 
  i really thought my neighbors were dead because i could n't hear a thing . 
  it 's such a quiet and relaxing country . 
  and the people there are just awesome . 
  most of the urban population lives in ceausescu style [ flats ] ( http://www.cronicaromana.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blocuri-vechi.jpg ) or have built some 2 stories villas like [ this ] ( http://i.clubafaceri.ro/clients/32/61238/68/case-de-vanzare-dambul-rotund-cluj-napoca-79353_big.jpg ) ( if they 've been in spain ) because a 2 story house is a symbol of wealth . 
  some ( mostly old ) live in poorer houses like [ this one ] ( http://www.cluj-case.ro/upload/oferte/original/vanzari-case-vile-cluj-dambul-rotund-51562.jpg ) but we also have some traditional houses : [ transylvanian saxon house ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2011-04-21-8522878-56-casa-saseasca.jpg ) [ hungarians in apuseni ] ( http://360ideas.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/rimetea.jpg ) [ romanians from maramures ] ( http://p1.picof.net/casa-traditionala-din-maramures-60045-l.jpg ) [ romanians from oltenia ] ( http://www.infopensiuni.ro/cazare-ramnicu-valcea/obiective-turistice-ramnicu-valcea/oltenia-de-sub-munte_36/poza-36_oltenia-de-sub-munte-casuta.jpg ) [ romanians from bukovina ] ( http://img.dollo.ro/2010/08/casa-batrana2.jpg ) oh , and i almost forgot : the architectural masterpieces the gypsies build from the money they get from begging in your wealthier country     http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/3682459456_148bd683d4.jpg, 
  in alsace , where my parents live is full of german coins , some french ones and if i get lucky i get spanish or portuguese ones . 
  the only irish euro i 've got is still in my wallet ( the lucky coin ) . 
  imagine that in the year 2150 we will be one great european country and have a roma minority . 
  because the therm roma was used during the great massacre of 2092 we have to call them , politically correct , europas . 
  your grand grandson wants to live in china because he found a nice girl there on the a cybersex site but he 's told `` unfortunately europeans do n't have a good image in china though due to the amount of europas begging on the streets . '', 
  i know that you do n't mean it and that you 're intelligent enough to make the difference between romanians and romas but it 's awful to have a bad image because of some other people with some strange traditions . 
  matthias corvinus is my personal hero and even though he was born in my city he 's not my country 's hero :(, 
  well some may say when they say that they live somewhere `` i stay in x city '' in romanian . 
  your phrase would be like `` stau in pula '' roughly translated to `` i stay in a cock '' which is a way of saying that you 've got a cock up your ass . 
  you do n't want that phrase translated into romanian . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tw7gd9j7l4 ) i think it 's made there . 
  it cracks me up every time . 
  for those of you who do n't know pula is the vulgar for penis in romanian . 
  it 's basically a video of people running around yelling `` penis '' for me . 
  if the hungarians admit that something is coming from romanian you know it 's true . 
  i really want to see if the new regions will make romania will improve this rate . 
  my opinion , they wo n't but you 'll have at least 4 years of politicians blaming the fact that the regions are new and not yet used to work this way . 
  no , it 's because we have no left in romania . 
  the only `` left-on-paper '' party is the psd but they are in an alliance with the liberals and conservators ( do n't ask ) called usl which calls itself `` a center-right alliance '' . 
  so if you do n't count populist parties made by tv hosts which some call left wing there are no political parties in the romanian parliament which can be put on the left of the political spectrum . 
  yeah sure , they are refugees but they will stay in europe a little bit longer after the conflicts in their home countries are over . 
  then start a riot because their rights are n't respected and because there are too many infidels in europe . 
  so my kind of federalism , regions not national countries . 
  that 's mainly the euro crisis in a nutshell . 
  instead of investing in southern countries , northern countries sent loans and received immigrants . 
  nah , it 's sad that i think romania is pretty good on the 66th place because it 's better that italy , bulgaria , montenegro , serbia , macedonia , albania and greece so it 's not the last place in europe . 
  tallinn is an awesome city , they were in the soviet union and russian empire . 
  and they are one of the only three finno-ugric national languages in europe together with hungarian and finnish so their language probably sounds pretty strange . 
  who ? 
  france thinks they are the most arrogant and the least arrogant . 
  i think this thing may be bullshit . 
  i 've heard of it . 
  there is one old guy in cluj that represents pas . 
  one guy , 300k city . 
  you want to know the best part about this ? 
  some of them do n't have a toilet inside the palace and some of them live in a tent next to the palace . 
  [ well it 's not like all gypsies in romania live in huge houses .
