  my reasoning is that if russia manages to create enough tensions between us ( not that we do n't create that tension ourselves sometimes ) , they can attack a torn eu , especially one which will receive limited support from the us . 
  will uk or france , the only two countries with nuclear capabilities , one who 'll leave the eu and one who 's growing eurosceptic , risk a nuclear war with russia over , say , estonia ? 
  the war on terror was a pretext for invading a 3rd world country . 
  do not underestimate russia . 
  that 's a bit selfish , is n't it ? 
  i 'm not trying to be rude here , but even if we spend 2 % for defense ( which is in our budget now ) , we are still poorer countries . 
  our 2 % matters up to a point . 
  if something happens , how will germany , as a country obligated to respond to article 5 , be able to help us ? 
  last time , the americans did n't come this far east unless it was to bomb us because we were allied with you and our oil was very important to the german war machine . 
  sounds nice !, 
  i 'm not extremely fond of our national anthem because of the rhythm , but i love [ this marching song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jzglj_cyy ) . 
  romania is finally at 2 % . 
  or so i think . 
  there 's a period of instability going on right now , but our new budget should have 2 % for defense . 
  then again , when shits hits the fan , us wo n't come and italy and spain have an obligation to answer article 5 . 
  let 's see how they 'll do then . 
  no more neutral spain this time . 
   it means he gets to control the black sea ports in a de facto nature while ensuring nato wo n't get anywhere near ukraine . 
  well , the romanian marine forces and loads of americans are already exercising in the black sea . 
  just last friday three russian planes tried to troll us and the americans by passing by in full speed and refusing to communicate . 
  what ? 
  this is just for show right ? 
  i find it hard to believe . 
  ** trump : ** i expect you to return crimea to ukraine , vladimir ** putin : ** of course donald * hysterical laughter *, 
  i think in the nordic countries kids are being taught who to call in case their parents get physically aggressive and i think this is also important because how can they tell ( or who can they tell ) if they 're not being taught/encouraged to do it . 
  in certain cases i think it has to do with it not being a problem . 
  a lack of legislation against something can also mean that something is n't a phenomenon that needs to be banned through law . 
  i can guess this could be at least switzerland 's and belgium 's case . 
  i 'm not betting on it though . 
  someone made a good argument in favor of this , but i can not find the comment anymore . 
   romanija clearly romanian clay . 
  boys , gather up !, 
  - we call them `` elve\u0163ia '' . 
  - federal state and multiple official languages . 
  - not in the eu . 
  - delicious chocolate . 
  - hold everyone 's money and they 're neutral . 
  - have guns , but better regulations than us . 
  - direct democracy . 
  - women gained the right to vote much later than other countries . 
  - beautiful country . 
  they 're all here . 
  all of them . 
  you can opt out of ebu for example afaik . 
  that 's good to hear . 
  i do n't know much about them , save for le pen , but i think macron is the better choice . 
   macron : 64 % ( +1 ) vs le pen : 36 % ( -1 ) for some reason i thought le pen would get a worse score against fillon , but maybe it 's the scandal that took a tool on preferences ? 
  yeah , that 's sad . 
  lucky poland . 
  well , yeah , i know about ny , but not more than the average european and certainly not enough to know about anything specific about that area . 
  would have preferred somewhere in california tho  ) ), 
  what should i know about providence , rhode island ? 
  cause i guess that 's where romania is located on the map . 
  on the bright side , we now border norway , denmark , italy , switzerland and slovakia . 
   who should pay for it ? 
  every country which wants to have this . 
  it would be just like a tax . 
  yay . 
  that 's great news . 
  wow , poland , not one year of negative growth ? 
  or is it because you joined earlier ? 
  anyway , everyone line up for ode to joy now !, 
  we 've been protesting so much in the last 3 years or so that honestly ... you start the year expecting to have to protest at one point . 
  at least i do . 
  it 's just the way things are here as long as sdp/alde hold majority in the parliament . 
  we talk a lot on our subreddit about the protests and after we did the romanian flag with colored paper and phone flashlights , someone suggested that we should also do the european flag . 
  some of us said that it would be too hard ( because of the stars ) and anyway something like this has to be initiated by the facebook pages who usually share messages about the protests in order for people to coordinate . 
  since everyone on our subreddit is fb-phobic and unlikely to write to the people who manage these pages about this idea , it probably wo n't happen . 
  could have been nice though . 
  however , just so you know , at our protests i 've seen several european flags and national flags ( german , american , canadian , bulgarian , slovenian , etc. ), 
  funny thing about the slovenia flag ... we could n't see it very well at first and could only make out the colors . 
  i was shocked for a second because i thought it was russian . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think it matters if he wore any nazi symbols which is prohibited by law in several countries . 
  edit :  austria strictly prohibits the public display and/or proliferation of all insignia/symbols , emblems , uniforms ( full or partial ) , flags , etc. , clearly associated with the national socialist german workers party ( nsdap , commonly known as the nazi party ) . 
  there are legal exceptions for works of art ( including books , films , theatre performances , computer games , and educational/memorial public exhibitions , etc. 
  ) , these however do not apply if the respective work promotes national socialism ( as this is generally prohibited in austria ) . 
  the law has been amended to include commonly recognized replacements or slightly modified depictions of nazi symbols . 
  violations of the badges act 1960 ( abzeichengesetz 1960 ) , which prohibits the public display of nazi symbols , are punishable by up to $ 4000 . - fine and up to 1 month imprisonment . 
  however , if the violation is deemed an attempt to promote national socialism , the prohibition act 1947 ( verbotsgesetz 1947 ) is applied , which allows for up to 10 years imprisonment . 
  trading medals , uniforms , or other memorabilia however is n't illegal in austria . 
  he 's arrested on charges of glorifying the nazis though . 
   wait , what are you guys protesting now ? 
  i like how it becomes a romanian stereotype to protest . 
  in bulgaria 's `` america first , bulgaria second '' they were also saying `` forget romanians , they 're always protesting '' . 
  hahaha !, 
  well , here 's the simplified tl ; dr : - echr judges romania for prison overcrowding and says we need to solve the problem . 
  - sdp/alde who currently hold the parliament and the government and who are the most corrupt parties we have try to use this excuse to free or help corrupt politicians , but especially sdp leader liviu dragnea . 
  on 31st january at night they gave two emergency ordinances that were basically meant to decriminalize some corruption acts such as abuse of power . 
  many people protested that night until 2-3am . 
  - after protests that initially started before they even gave these two emergency ordinances , and which peaked when there were 600k people protesting throughout romania , not even mentioning the diaspora or the bulgarian citizens who protested for us , the government repealed those emergency ordinances through another emergency ordinance . 
  now it 's up to the parliament ( where sdp and alde have majority ) to approve or reject the appeal . 
  and there 's also a law project similar to the first two eos in the parliament , waiting to be discussed . 
  so it 's a mess basically . 
  - people want to get rid of these things forever and get the government to resign . 
  up until now only the moj resigned , but he 's a pawn in a bigger game so it does n't satisfy us . 
   what amount of people are there ? 
  yesterday there were 70k in bucharest , but there were people protesting in major cities as well . 
  diaspora was also protesting . 
  totally agree . 
  it would be nice if we could contact accept , mozaiq , coruptia ucide and impreuna rezistam to help us organize a march .
