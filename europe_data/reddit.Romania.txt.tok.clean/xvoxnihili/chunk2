  - a is pronounced like in `` father '' - \u0103 is pronounced like in `` above '' - \u0163 is pronounced ts like in tsunami . 
  - \u015f is pronounced sh like in shark . 
  there 's also \u00e2 and \u00ee , but ca n't think of how to explain their pronunciation . 
  it 's kind of like when you say `` ugh '' . 
  for example : - tanc = tank - \u0163\u00e2nc = a way of saying little child or little boy, 
  lol, 
  da , da . 
  oooo !, 
  trist !, 
   we will use your organs for good my friend . 
  aur !, 
  well , i know a couple of things directed at my country that were n't jokes . 
  nu \u015ftiu exact care . . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/s3hb59pjaoo?t=5 ), 
  haha, 
  unfortunately ... 
  haha, 
  haha . 
  god , i hope our government did n't fuck that up too . 
  thanks for the indication !, 
  the leave campaign was right all along !!, 
  do you mean trump ? 
  well , what can we do ? 
  the situation with defense spending in europe is not exactly good and i get that western europeans are not worried or that `` defense spending loses votes in germany '' as someone told me , but there 's a different situation in the east . 
  we 're neighbours with ukraine and crimea is less than 500km away , putin has a high interest in the black sea and has threatened us a good number of times . 
  and this is just romania , there 's also a tension filled situation in the baltic area . 
  trump is an idiot and makes threats and shit , but the defense spending should increase nonetheless , whether it 's for nato or for creating a common eu defense . 
  even obama said it . 
  and like i said . . it 's smart . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  i get that europeans feel insulted by trump 's attitude , i do too for a number of reasons , but trump is a temporary problem ( or so i hope ) and while we can remain firm in our relationship with him , we should also not betray our interests to stick it trump . 
  more about it [ here ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romania-expands-tax-incentives-software-programmers/ ) . 
  we know what we 're dealing with . 
  edit : and besides , we made a commitment . 
  investing in defense when we 're in this position is being smart . 
  is n't 2024 the deadline ? 
  why is trump rushing everyone ? 
  we spend 2 % too since january 2017 iirc , but apparently no newspaper mentions this . 
  good . 
  maybe crimea wo n't ever be returned , but at least russia will suffer for it . 
  you ca n't do stuff without consequences . 
  he feels inferior . 
  that 's all that comment tells us . 
  they 're still shit , but as bad as during those days . 
  it 's probably not the last time we 'll protest as psd will make the next 3 years and 9 months very hard . 
  there are still some protests going on , but the numbers are quite small . 
  2016 support for home country democracy in romania was pretty big and then 2017 happened . 
   .  as a side note , greece is ... oh well . 
  of course . 
  those who want the eu to be destroyed are probably not even the majority . 
  i should have mentioned `` some brexiters '' , but i thought people would assume i do n't mean all of them . 
   `` it 's pretty early to discuss these things . 
  it 's common here , for us , for a concept that barely took off , to already have analysts that foresee the end of the process . 
  no , romania just signed two or three days ago the letter of intent to be part of this european prosecutor 's office project , thus it 's a long way until a strengthened cooperation is achieved , as i called it , in order to proceed to the next phase . 
  therefore , it 's much too early to talk about such thing , '' iohannis stated , when asked regarding the scenarios according to which chief-prosecutor of the national anticorruption directorate ( dna ) laura codru\u0163a kovesi could be proposed to take over the lead of the european prosecutor 's office . 
  she said not before brexit ends iirc . 
  i do n't think that once you leave you should have a say in who does what or whatever the eu should be . 
  because whatever the eu countries do regarding internal matters after the uk leaves is no longer uk 's business . 
  sure , you might have an opinion , but if that opinion is * i hope the eu falls apart * , do n't expect sympathy from those who are in the union and support it , with its good and bad parts . 
  this man has humor . 
  lol, 
  how can i blame ignorance ? 
  i obviously did not mean every brexiter wishes that . 
  i 'm not triggered as i think uk should not stay in the eu right now as it is clear , like you said , that they do n't fit in at the moment . 
  i 'm just pointing out my experience with brexiters and op literally gave an example themselves . 
  obviously i did n't mean every brexiter , just the ones i 've seen do this and i 've seen quite a few . 
  while french people tend to be negative towards the eu , only around 30 % expressed a desire to leave . 
  greece , for example , has a much higher negative opinion on the eu , but they would n't vote out either . 
  there 's a difference between * i would be okay with france having a referendum because i see the people want to leave * and * i hope the eu breaks up * . 
  that 's not what i said or even implied . 
  and it is not your or farage 's place to tell other countries what to do . 
  that 's bad . 
  ca n't seem to find an article on that tho . 
  could you please share ? 
  love it when it 's not okay to do that to dutch/german people , but it 's okay to do that to romanians and even defend it ... 
  quite a few of them with farage in the lead . 
  being okay with scotland having a referendum and wanting the eu to be destroyed are two vastly different things . 
  being okay with scotland having a referendum and wanting the eu to be destroyed are two vastly different things . 
  but not [ romanians . . ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img/2008/05/12/810289.jpg ) or dogs . 
  it did happen . 
  [ in spain . 
  did n't a spanish shop wrote `` no romanians or dogs allowed '' on a sign ? 
  edit : [ yep ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img/2008/05/12/810289.jpg ), 
  i 've always said that if there is something spiteful about brexiters is that they do n't just want to leave the eu , they want the eu to be destroyed . 
  petty . 
  if poland has it bad on this sub , i do n't know what our situation can be called ... 
  even poles forget they get picked on by others and then pick on us too . 
  lol , buddy , chill . 
  this is a forum , not a private conversation . 
  everyone will answer whatever they want . 
  hey , portugal , wan na switch ? 
  [  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/ka9wcth35n3ak/giphy.gif ), 
  denmark has an opt out i think . 
  poland will have to use it at some point . 
  romania does n't either , but like poland , it 's obligated to at some point . 
  sweden is obligated as well , but intentionally avoids meeting criteria to join euro . 
  our romanian version ( obviously not official ) says something similar : note : a pretty literal translation and i 'm not good at it so yeah . 
  corrections welcome . 
   those who had the luck  to find good friends  those who know what love is  should stand next to us singing  a dear soul can make you happy on this earth  those who did n't feel the love  should leave crying original lyrics of this third and fourth verse :  cine a avut norocul  de prieteni buni s\u0103 dea  cine \u0219tie ce-i iubirea  l\u00e2ng\u0103 noi c\u00e2nt\u00e2nd s\u0103 stea  fericit un suflet drag  te poate face pe p\u0103m\u00e2nt  cine n-a sim\u021bit iubirea  plece dintre noi pl\u00e2ng\u00e2nd . 
  you will be .
