  since we had communism , we had it too , but it 's not the same thing when there 's only one option and voting is just a play pretend . 
  western democracies have educated their people with the notion that their vote counts while also being able to grasp basic political notions . 
  the voting is n't mandatory anymore , but since the people have grown with it , they find it normal ( as it is ) to and express their democratic right and responsibility . 
  our presidential elections have the biggest voting presence ( around 60 % ) which probably happens because of the `` simplicity '' of the elections . 
  parliamentary elections like the recent one we had in december last year when sdp won ? 
  40 % people voted and sdp won 45 % of the votes . 
  then they made a coalition with alde ( 6 % ) and udmr ( 6 % ) . 
  it may be democratic , but it certainly is n't representative at all . 
  believe me , we would too . 
  nope , he 's not barred . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think only certain convicted politicians can get barred from politics for a period of time . 
  yep . 
  protests in weekend will grow in numbers . 
  we will not give up until this danger passes . 
  and hopefully until grindeanu and his cabinet are out . 
  romania 's politics are more often driven out of interests rather than ideology , but the liberal party ( pnl ) and the centrist party ( usr ) are the least corrupted ones . 
  the new centrist party is n't corrupted at all yet . 
  romania 's sdp is a shame for european sdp . 
  i believe there was even a petition for the european sdp to separate themselves from the romanian sdp . 
  alde is the same . 
  they recently criticize the eu and their leader hinted at roexit a week ago or so . 
  like what alde member would do that ? 
  everyone here on / r/europe kept asking me if it 's a joke , but no , it is n't , because they do n't care about the ideology , they just know that the eu is an obstacle in their dirty business . 
  our economical/financial education is very bad . 
  all sdp/alde do is promise people an increase in pensions and salaries , spend irresponsibly in the budget , cut taxes , steal some money ( from our budget because they ca n't steal from the eu and that is why they have close to no interest in the eu ) and fuck our deficit . 
  this is the reason why alde leader calin popescu tariceanu has criticized the 3 % deficit limit imposed by the eu . 
  by the time another coalition comes to power , they fuck our funds so badly that the new coalition has to make some cuts which angers the uneducated people who welcome the irresponsible measures sdp/alde promises . 
  that 's why you always hear the uneducated people here say , `` of course we 'll vote sdp , they give us some money . 
  those other parties only cut pensions and salaries . '', 
  i do agree with the sentiment of wanting a better salary or pension , but they will keep getting cut if we do n't raise them strategically . 
  thank you !, 
  still more to go . 
  hopefully we can achieve our goals . 
  it 's a dirty fight from sdp/alde . 
  no , the danger has not passed yet . 
  his resignation is too little , too late . 
   president klaus iohannis , the superior council of magistracy and the ombudsman all gave notice to the constitutional court regarding these oes . 
  the first two were about a constitutional conflict between the executive power and the judiciary power and between the executive power and the legislative power . 
  the last one was for the exception of unconstitutionality . 
  all three were rejected by the court . 
  now , eo14 , which is supposed to repeal eo13 , has to go through the parliament where sdp/alde has a majority . 
  they might reject eo14 which means that eo13 will be going through the parliament as well . 
  it all depends if the parliament will reject eo14 or not . 
  if they do , a complicated time will follow and it wo n't be good at all . 
  there certainly is . 
  since the danger of eo13 has not passed yet and since the people do n't trust the sdp/alde coalition anymore , they wo n't stop until they 'll at least make sure eo13 is gone forever . 
  after that , there will be calls for sorin grindeanu ( pm ) to resign along with his whole cabinet . 
  most of us want liviu dragnea ( sdp leader ) to fall too because he 's the head of all these fucked up moves , but we do n't know if we can make it happen . 
  background : - on 11th december , elections were won by sdp ( social democrats ) who made a coalition with alde and udmr ( hungarian minority party ) . 
  - although the government of prime minister sorin grindeanu repeatedly denied that there were government ordinance bills regarding the pardoning and amnesty of committed crimes , there were strong rumors in the media that the government intended to pass such bills on 18 january 2017 , mere days after the government was sworn in . 
  since the government did not publish the government meeting 's agenda for that day , the president of romania , klaus iohannis , took it upon himself to attend and preside over the meeting , as envisioned by article 87 of the constitution of romania . 
  after a private meeting between the president , the prime minister and the justice minister ( florin iordache ) , the government meeting was convened and presided over by the president together with the prime minister . 
  despite the prime minister 's initial attempt to block the press ' attendance and subsequent avoidance of the subject , the president announced to the media that there were two bills regarding the pardoning of crimes and the amendment of the penal code of romania . 
  he further announced that the prime minister assured him that these ordinances would not be passed without a transparent process , which included consulting with the relevant judicial institutions , as well as the public . 
  - protests against this bill have been going on since 18th january , but they were smaller ( 5000 across romania ) and foreign media did n't give them much attention . 
  - 31st january : although the government meeting 's agenda only included the approval of the proposed 2017 budget , the cabinet secretly introduced and approved the ordinance bills during the meeting that evening . 
  once florin iordache , the justice minister , announced to the press that evening that the bills had been approved , a protest started taking place 30 minutes afterwards . 
  within two hours , the protest swelled to 15,000 people despite the late hours and cold weather . 
  due to the small initial presence of the gendarmes , the victoria palace was completely surrounded by the protesters and the main entrances blocked ( although the people inside managed to leave through other entrances ) . 
  the protest only subsided by 2 am . 
  - 1st february : this is the only day where protests got violent . 
  after 10pm a group of hooligans mixed with the crowd and started throwing molotov cocktails and rocks at the gendarmes . 
  they were eventually separated and contained . 
  the protesters actually tried to stop them , but they could n't . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think one of them admitted he was paid . 
  this was interesting because there were rumors on social media about hooligans showing up ever since the morning and although secret service informed the minister of internal affairs , she said she did not know , that they did n't come in a group and could n't be stopped . 
  a few days later , a few other hooligans tried the same thing , but they were stopped by the gendarmes before they could mix with the crowd . 
  a lot of people believe that the minister of internal affairs knew , but refused to take actions . 
  - 5th february : although the grindeanu cabinet adopted a new ordinance bill repealing the original bill , over 600,000 people came out to protest , thus making the protests the largest in romania 's history . 
  the uncertain constitutionality of the new ordinance ( the repealing one ) , as well as the refusal of the government to meet any other demands ( resignation of the justice minister , resignation of the cabinet ) , led the protesters to question the government 's determination and the finality of the matter . 
  furthermore , prime minister grindeanu stated that the government will try instead to pass the majority of the content from the original ordinance in a new bill through parliament ( where sdp and alde have a comfortable majority ) , angering protesters further . 
  - between 1,500 and 2,500 people rallied in support of the grindeanu government at cotroceni palace during the afternoon . 
  the protesters demanded the resignation of president klaus iohannis . 
  the number of pro government protesters raised to a maximum of 4000 in the following days . 
  - sdp leader , liviu dragnea , stated that he did not organize these protests although he talked about doing this before . 
  he claimed that although he did nor organize these protests , he knew they were coming because the people voted for his party and supported his governing plan . 
  this plan , however , never included these emergency ordinances . 
  - an interesting and pretty convincing rumor , although not confirmed officially , but supported by some journalists , is that many pro government protesters were actually rallied by other sdp members ( most probably instructed by the sdp leader ) who brought ( some of ) them from other romanian cities to bucharest to protest in front of the cotroceni palace . 
  some claim they were paid , but these are just rumors . 
  - however , this does not mean that sdp does n't have supporters , it 's just that often sdp supporters do not go out to protest . 
  instead , they are very organized during elections , whereas the other parties ' electorates are less so . 
  keep in mind that romania sees its biggest voting presence during presidential elections and that only 39-40 % people voted in parliamentary elections . 
  a true , sad fact . 
  - 7th february : president klaus iohannis holds a speech in parliament about the government and criticizes it not only for the eos , corruption and a lack of transparency , but also for the way they refuse to accept responsibility for what they did because the government did not even dismiss the minister of justice let alone resign or take any form of responsibility . 
  members of sdp and alde walk out of the parliament during his speech and protest verbally . 
  - 8th february : protests continue and numbers are lower due to people having to work and due to the very cold weather , but the numbers are also rising as the weekend approaches . 
  although i do not have a number for the protesters across the country , there were 9000 + in bucharest last evening , protesting in -5 \u00b0 c temperature while it was snowing . 
  protests are expected to grow in number during the weekend as government continues to ignore the people and insult them . 
  - the no confidence motion took place yesterday , but it obviously failed as sdp/alde hold the majority . 
  even so , worth mentioning is that sdp/alde/udmr abstained from the vote at the order of the party leaders ( liviu dragnea , calin popescu tariceanu and hunor kelemen ) . 
  some people say that the reason they abstain was fear of certain party members who might be secretly against what this government is doing to their image and who would be willing to vote for the no confidence motion . 
  - president iohannis tried to communicate with pro government protesters today , but they did n't seem to want to talk with him and just yelled for his resignation . 
  - ** who was against these emergency ordinances besides protesters in romania : ** a few sdp members who resigned , a sdp member that did not resign but publicly denounced the emergency ordinances , some sdp & alde voters ( the sdp member who publicly denounced the eos , but did not resign , declared that a survey shows that sdp lost 23 % of the support , but i did not take this for a fact ) , udmr ( also part of the parliamentary coalition ) , the opposition ( save romania union and national liberal party ) , a significant part of the romanian diaspora , some bulgarian citizens , some moldovan citizens , the eu , some nato countries including canada and the us ( who was very outspoken about it ) , switzerland , several embassies ( but i guess this can be included in the eu part ) , the american chamber of commerce , romanian ngos and others . 
  - ** actions besides citizens protesting : ** the opposition ( usr + pnl ) submitted a no-confidence motion against the government ( which failed ) , pnl submitted a law proposal for the repeal of the emergency ordinances ( which was ignored ) and both parties protested during parliamentary sessions . 
  usr also had a `` occupy wall street '' sort of protest for 5 days . 
  president klaus iohannis , the superior council of magistracy and the ombudsman all gave notice to the constitutional court regarding these oes . 
  the first two were about a constitutional conflict between the executive power and the judiciary power and between the executive power and the legislative power . 
  the last one was for the exception of unconstitutionality . 
  all three were rejected by the court . 
  now , eo14 , which is supposed to repeal eo13 , has to go through the parliament where sdp/alde has a majority .
