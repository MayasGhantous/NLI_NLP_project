  i do n't think any country will allow uk to have any more opt outs . 
  in the end , eu aims for a political and economical union . 
  but then again look at sweden . 
  we 're not giving her away to the eu . 
  she will not have time for us anymore and boy , do we need her . 
  i think our president said we co-initiated this project , but i ca n't find english sources . 
  some eu citizens will leave for sure . 
  not all , of course . 
  it 's not just brexit , it 's the uk being different after brexit . 
  many of them prefer stability so they will either move back home or relocate in another eu country if they have the money . 
  it 's cheap because nobody punishes your companies for hiring them at a lower wage than they would a local . 
  portugalia the rebel . 
  sorry dude , i 'm not the one saying racists brexiters are only a meme . 
  but i guess it 's easy for you to say that . 
  those are not questionable sources at all . 
  did you want a link to the sun perhaps ? 
  so in the end , whether or not those murders were linked to brexit racists or not , attacks did happen and just because they did n't end up in murder does not mean they do n't matter . 
   they do not seem to think they were linked . 
  mhm . 
  okay , let 's scratch that if you think it was n't . 
  how about this : http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/uk-polish-man-latest-victim-hate-crime-surge-160913153112373.html http://www.dw.com/en/eastern-european-migrants-in-the-uk-face-growing-hostility/a-19562199, 
   the eu has negatively impacted british lives and livelihoods lol , did it really ? 
  i do n't think people were mad that the uk wanted to leave , i think people were mad that instead of making a decision on facts , they voted based on ukip 's propaganda . 
  okay , but they 're certainly not a meme . 
  they are people who have attacked eu citizens in the uk . 
  some were even killed . 
  we should not make light of that either . 
  both the eu and the uk should address this issue first thing . 
  the lives of people should not be a * bargaining chip * . 
  this is a whole new level of `` are you really sure you want to proceed ? '' . 
  lol, 
  [ i guess we should listen and watch this video once again to remember where we were and where we are now . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4rjjkxsamq ), 
  by  there 's no hard and soft brexit when it comes to citizens . 
  i meant that i assume that uk will be more sensible than this :  healthy poo consistency : no access to public fund and have to pay an nhs surcharge . 
   penultimate hardness : you can stay as long as you either earn # 38k , work in the nhs or work in a doctororal level job . 
   they 're in a very good relations with uk and ready to sacrifice a lot on eu stage to further their own political games . 
  well then i hope they 'll be reasonable . 
  there 's no hard and soft brexit when it comes to citizens . 
  uk would be really dumb not to agree on talking about this first thing . 
  secure the rights of eu citizens and uk nationals and then we can fight on whatever else , but this is something that needs immediate attention and a lot of sensible discussion . 
   imagine if an eastern european country blocks a deal for whatever reason , that will cause a lot of tension internally . 
  i hate how you put that . 
  after all , it 's not like doing something they do n't have the right to do . 
  but we will most likely not block anything unless our inputs are not taken into consideration and the deal goes against ee interests in a really bad way . 
  pretty spot on for romania . 
  our president has said that the most important thing is securing rights for eu citizens in the uk , but that obviously also means securing rights for uk nationals . 
  he does n't want the people to have to go through really scary times and not know what will happen to them . 
  he wants the eu and the uk to really settle this in a way everyone will know what their future holds and what to do to get through brexit . 
  i do n't believe in either soft or hard brexit , i believe the eu must conclude their priorities and stand their ground when they have to . 
  there are certain things which you can not compromise . 
  we had 20c yesterday . 
  ouch . 
  yes , of course . 
  well , i assume it 's half circlejerk , half really feeling bad . 
  nothing wrong with some people feeling bad about the whole thing . 
  it is certainly not a pleasant scenario for some . 
  and humor releases tension . 
  i think scottish independence will make it even more important and defining and historical . 
  [ ... ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/135e47vkw6tm6a/giphy.gif ), 
  you should definitely try to get some expert advice on that . 
  even if they do n't know exactly what will happen , they might tell you what 's best to do . 
  i 'm sure it wo n't happen overnight . 
  good luck uk !, 
  you 'll need it !, 
  maybe you can come back one day if you want !, 
  ^ ^ la ^ ^ revedere ^ ^ is ^ ^ kind ^ ^ of ^ ^ like ^ ^ until ^ ^ we ^ ^ meet ^ ^ again ^ ^ so ... ^ ^ maybe . 
   take any article about `` foreigner crime '' in any eastern european newspaper . 
  that same article could just as well be from a western european newspaper from the 60s . 
  i do n't know what that means . 
   we 've been there , done that . 
  and now we tend to have a holier-than-thou attitude about it . 
  yeah , i guess being safe from russian occupation and communism does that . 
  romania will start a campaign to inform parents of the dangers of not vaccinating your child . 
  first they * must * meet with a couple of specialists that will give them proper information and then if they still refuse to vaccinate their child they will have to sign a document that says they 're responsible for what happens to their child . 
  the parents who refuse to take part in this procedure ( counseling + signing the form ) might be sanctioned , but it is not clear yet on how . 
  initially they wanted to impose fines of 550 euros but that might not go through . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/lower-quality-of-same-food-brands-in-eastern-europe-raises-eyebrows/ for slovakia and hungary it is proved . 
  that 's cringy alright . 
  the brits are coming . 
  roma people , like any other citizens of the eu , are free to move within the eu . 
  if they do n't abide by the law , they can be sent back afaik . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  i thought western europe were masters at integrating minorities and they are never , ever racists or xenophobes . 
  and you know who else is net receiver ? 
  spain , belgium , greece , portugal , slovenia , slovakia , poland , cyprus , croatia , bulgaria , czechia , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , luxembourg and malta . 
  that is not fair or democratic . 
  we did take refugees . 
  wait a second , i 'll be back with relevant links that show you otherwise .

   if we had a constitution which said that we owned the earth , it would n't be tolerated internationally . 
  this example makes no sense . 
   `` might makes right '' no , might and especially russia 's might ends in mass murder for eastern countries , but it makes nothing right . 
  let 's remember how many of those russian minorities arrived in their host countries . 
  let 's remember the deportations of the locals . 
  it 's not as simple as you think it is . 
  yep . 
  a lot of people from russian minorities intentionally create problems for the host country ... and a lot of them are in said countries because russia occupied those countries by force in the time of the soviet union and deported locals to places like siberia . 
  even if that was the case , i do n't know , all i can say is ... fuck the soviet union and whatever they promised to it . 
  the soviet union does not exist anymore .
