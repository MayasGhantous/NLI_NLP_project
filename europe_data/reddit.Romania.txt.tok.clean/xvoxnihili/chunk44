   eastern europe became very eurosceptic citation needed , good sir . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm from romania , we do n't know of this `` world cup '' you 're speaking of , whatever it is . 
  ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ team ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ too ^ ^ ^ shitty ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ qualify ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ yet ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ manage ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ beat ^ ^ ^ countries ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ chile ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ friendlies . 
  well , germany just recently declared war on the netherlands after the wehrmacht hanged a family of bicycles . 
  finland showed up and said their bicycles are more abused than the dutch ones , just to prove to the dutch that they 're doing * better * in the statistics . 
   what do you think about the future of the eu ? 
  and what about the future of europe ? 
  i think eu will continue to have its problems , but it 's not going to crash anytime soon as some think . 
  europe , generally , has thrived through worse times . 
  i think we 'll be alright , but we do need to be careful of certain dangers such as populism . 
   what do you think are the best and worst things about living in europe ? 
  best thing ? 
  the rich culture , the fascinating history , being able to just travel and meet all these different people with whom you still share some sort of european heritage . 
  the eu is a big pro . 
  i do n't know what 's the worst thing about living in europe though . 
  i guess maybe the fact that we were not always this friendly with each other and that had and still has consequences . 
   what is the general opinion about argentina ? 
  i 'd say it 's overall positive because of a lack of knowledge ( not implying that if there was more knowledge of argentina , it would be seen negatively , but whatever people know of argentina here , it 's nothing bad ) . 
  mostly known for football . 
  well , yeah , i mean , a celebration of some kind is due , but it is not common to make a trip afaik . 
   how much of roman history do you learn in highschool ? 
  quite a bit since they 're partly our ancestors . 
   which kind of stereotypes exist in your country about argentina ? 
  good at football . 
   in argentina after end highschool almost always the entire classroom decide to travel to bariloche . 
  in your country after highschool everyone agree to travel to some place ? 
  which one ? 
  i do n't think we have that . 
   argentina  slavbros boy , you have a romance speaking country here in eastern europe and you choose slavs to be your bros ? 
   where are you from and how are argentinians seen in your country ? 
  romania . 
  i do n't think we talk a lot about argentinians . 
  i think you 're just generally viewed as people who are good at football . 
  i do n't think there are people who hold bad views of argentinians , but most people do n't know a lot about your country . 
  guess i 'm guilty of that too . 
   what 's the best place to visit on holidays ? 
  well , each region of our country has its perks , but transylvania is more visited by tourists . 
   what 's the best food on the continent ? 
  eastern europe has some good food , but so does southern europe . 
   where can you find the prettiest women in europe ? 
  depends on your preferences . 
  countries like serbia are fond of nationalism and recent history and they paint russia as an important friend . 
  how would eu and nato trust them to have a clear judgement ? 
  remember that in the eu , they 'd get veto power and some of us would n't like certain things , especially in relation to russia , to be vetoed just because they are sentimental about russia . 
  i do n't have anything against serbian people or serbia and if they 're really committed to join , they should be able to , but the concern is there and it is founded . 
  maybe , but the point is russia and eu/nato are at odds so of course people have their worries . 
  russia represents a great friend of serbia , more so since the kosovo war . 
   why would that be ? 
  because they 're quite friendly to russia . 
  well , our crazy corrupt idiots won with 45 % of the votes with a 40 % turnout and they tried to legalize corruption so ... it can happen when a lot of other people simply do n't care . 
  thankfully , we protested massively and we stopped them , but there are still some `` milder '' attempts and there are still protests . 
  since january , people have been protesting on and off , but in smaller numbers . 
  they 're more preoccupied with fucking up the economy right now though , but they still try here and there to save their corrupt members and friends from going to jail . 
  the biggest problem here is the people that never vote and how to make them vote and preferably vote with responsibility . 
  well imagine that romania was supposed to be in schengen 6 years ago when we met the criteria according to the eu parliament . 
  we 're still not in it because it can be vetoed by other member states and 3 countries have done so the last time it was put to vote . 
  so you never know . 
  yes , you may not be blocked forever from entering the eu , but you will sure have a bad economical experience throughout the waiting period . 
  shut up lithuania !, 
  * drinks some more \u0163uic\u0103 *, 
   we are doing just fine you dropped an / s ? 
  he seems quite amused . 
  ~ ~ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ handsome ~ ~, 
  but the point is , even if you get spain 's approval , which i doubt , you have a lot of countries which have their own reservations and might as well block you . 
  any country in the eu can block catalonia from entering . 
  i think we 'd have our reservations as well . 
  this is so weird and funny . 
  the dutch are known to be obsessed with bikes . 
  if they could be something when they grow up , they 'd be bikes . 
  germany killed the mama , tata and bebe bikes . 
  come to ours . 
   and they are fending off polish criticisms that their proposed `` nord stream 2 '' gas pipeline from russia to germany will make europe more dependent on russia . 
  and it is n't just poland which criticizes the ns2 , a big number of cee countries do . 
   this also applies to posts that have been posted in the last few hours . 
  nooo mr mod do n't delet terminator president plox . 
  :( but yeah i agree . 
  there needs to be a break from time to time . 
  edit : a / u/canadianman22 stole my salat\u0103 . 
  you think germany was n't going to attack france ? 
  you think france , treaty with poland or not , would have stood there and watch hitler go at it and be like `` nah , it 's not my problem , obviously it wo n't affect me '' ? 
  france , at the very least , was going to fight either way and your condescending tone about helping a nation of people invaded by two major powers at once is quite obnoxious to be honest . 
  common sense ? 
  do n't put your fingers in electrical sockets , you 'll get shocked . 
  maybe , but i can blame them for little will to argue in favor of those in the east . 
  you are right , though i expected france to care at least a bit as we used to have some close ties with them . 
  they did declare war when poland was invaded by germany so there 's that . 
  did n't happen with the su tho . 
  okay , but transylvania had a romanian majority . 
  nobody just `` gave us territory '' , we were entitled to it because the majority of people were romanian . 
  that has nothing to do with anything . 
  i ca n't talk about something that would have saved my older family members and all these people from the cancer that was the soviet occupation , the deportations and communism ? 
  tell me more . 
  yes , but let 's remember death is n't always the worst thing . 
  the communist prisons , especially for those who were `` enemies of the state '' , which could even mean someone who said something against communism or the leader and was heard by a neighbour who happened to be a `` informator '' , were horrific . 
  we 're judging cases of extreme torture even today . 
  and then there was the deportations , the lack of food or basic human necessities and the orphanages . 
  things were complicated . 
  many factors to take into account . 
  i 'm not saying having millions die for this would have been wonderful , i 'm just thinking about all those others who suffered or died under such a system and who could have had a different way of life if things would have gone diiferently . 
   it just was n't going to end well for either sides .
