  that , of course , is true , but we 'd also be standing in different positions today . 
  imagine a eastern europe that would n't have been touched by all of that . 
  sure , that does n't mean it would have been a paradise , maybe not even 100 % on western level , but it sure would have been nicer . 
  anyway . 
  it 's spilt milk . 
  but that did happen anyway , did n't it ? 
  not in millions , sure , but so many people were tortured and killed because of the soviet occupation and the communism that lasted half a century . 
   maybe if the rest of europe had n't collaborated with the nazis so enthusiastically , they could have been beaten in a shorter timeframe . 
  this is an oversimplification and slight distortion of reality . 
  the deaths came anyway . 
  it tends to happen during years of soviet occupation and half a century of communism . 
  they were just as tired and they 'd be outnumbered . 
  the allies should have fucked up the ussr as soon as germany was over . 
  what 's the point of preventing germany from a dictatorial takeover if the soviet union was going to do the same ( which was common knowledge among the leaders i guess ) . 
  instead , influence contracts were signed by the ussr with other allies to see who gets to influence what in eastern europe . 
  ~ ~ why did germany receive allied aid in restoration after wwii and the eastern nations did n't ? ~ ~ edit : got it . 
  totally escaped me . 
   eight days later , nazi germany invaded the second polish republic . 
  expecting military aid from britain and france , poland chose not to execute its alliance with romania in order to be able to use the romanian bridgehead . 
  romania officially remained neutral and , under pressure from the soviet union and germany , interned the fleeing polish government after its members had crossed the polish-romanian border on 17 september , forcing them to relegate their authority to what became the polish government-in-exile . 
   after the assassination of prime minister armand c\u0103linescu on 21 september king carol ii tried to maintain neutrality for several months longer , but the surrender of the third french republic and the retreat of british forces from continental europe rendered the assurances that both countries had made to romania meaningless . 
   in 1940 , romania 's territorial gains made following world war i were largely undone . 
  in july , after a soviet ultimatum , romania had to give up bessarabia and northern bukovina . 
  and then the fascists resorted to a coup and took the power and joined the axis . 
  the real bummer is that temperatures like this are felt even stronger by humans . 
  like it could be 40 outside , but you could feel as if it 's 45 instead . 
  mainly in the cities where the concrete holds and radiates so much heat . 
  plus , pollution and other factors make heat even more unbearable . 
  he always looks so stiff ... and this picture ... 
  it looks like all happiness has drained from the world and it borders on creepy . 
  still funny though . 
  actually that works for us as well since they both pledged to protect us too . 
  there are attempts , here and there , but there are still protests , here and there . 
  this guy is actually popular abroad . 
  personally , i 'm not a fan of the genre . 
  i do n't think many romanians here on reddit are . 
  yeah , i do n't think this dude , the leader of the social democrats , who said this , particularly cares whether or not someone is of german ethnicity or whatever , but he knows he 's scoring points with the conservative electorate by trying to discredit a romanian with a foreign ethnicity as someone who does n't have romania 's interest at heart , and as long as you 're on his side to help him gain more power , you could be anyone . 
  yes , that did happen , especially making jabs at his foreign name . 
  but what is funny about him being attacked for being a `` foreigner '' or having a `` foreign name '' and his german ethnicity ( which is laughable considering the saxons were here for a long time ) is that the dude who did it was also supportive of a muslim woman with a foreign name . 
  he was like `` we will not sell our country to *** klaus werner johannis *** , but we will give it to my close friend , *** sevil shhaideh *** !! '', 
  when he was asked why was he making jabs at the president but not at this woman he was like `` please , be respectful , mrs. shhaideh is a romanian citizen . '', 
  like ????????????? 
  the irony of it all is amazing . 
  what i meant is that the romanian recipe and the russian one are still different . 
  still they 're different . 
  more like `` beef salad '' . 
  take that croatia !, 
  here we come turkey !, 
  * says as politicians are fucking up the economy *, 
  here 's what it looks like [ inside ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2m3uthra_ic/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
   salat\u0103 de boeuf is a traditional romanian dish , generally served during all festive and special occasions . 
  it is a combination of finely chopped beef or chicken and root vegetables , folded in mayonnaise and finished with mur\u0103turi , pickled vegetable garnishes . 
  it can be made vegetarian , too . 
  i see . 
  thanks . 
  no joke or banter , what 's wrong with `` mother '' ? 
   the purer you are , the more quality you get . 
   i am a nazi i 'm just going to read your comment like this because what you said is bullshit and has nothing to do with the matter at hand . 
  `` better people '' ... lol what ? 
  more annoying than us getting shittier food for the same or more money ? 
  you got your priorities straight i guess . 
  maybe they could let go of crimea ( although they should n't and it should never be recognized as part of russia ) , but it 's harder to let go of donbass since it 's a different situation there and ukraine still has a grip on it . 
   should return to russia what a little bitch . 
  lol, 
  not really . 
  a lot of these products are same price , in some cases more expensive or less , but generally around the same price . 
  protv did a news report on a similar thing . 
  they took two meat cans , same product , same quantity , one from romania and one from germany and they compared them . 
  the one from germany had 87 % meat and the romanian one had 65 % . 
  the german one was 99 euro cents while the romanian one was 1,50 euros . 
  it is truly annoying that people do not realize this is a nasty thing that should be combated . 
  keep in mind that those are more nato related issues than the eu . 
   eastern european passports . 
  oh fuck off with bullshit like this . 
  scumbags . 
  there are poor people in dire need of things that do n't go out stealing them and claiming it 's an anti globalist protest or whatever . 
  this is no longer about sticking it to the big man , but rather about fucking over the little man . 
  if there are genuine protesters somewhere in that city , they should make sure they do not let these nasty people near them and the police should arrest these idiots on site . 
  pepper spray to the face and off to the police station you nasty thieves . 
   anti israel and thus antisemitic viewpoints . 
  you do know there are anti israel jews right ? 
  they 're antisemitic too ? 
  anti israel = / = antisemitic, 
  i love how none of them have signs so people can see their message or even act like normal protesters . 
  like shit we had 600k out one night with no incidents . 
  it seems counterproductive to literally destroy so much . 
  both us presidents : will you ... will you dance with me vladimir ? 
  putin : * blushes *, 
  these protests have been in the news here , apparently lots of violence and stuff . 
  it certainly does . 
  romania was third on that list and moldova is n't even in this list so i 'm a bit skeptical . 
  from what i 've read ...  on paper it is primarily a regional initiative to improve north-south infrastructure links in central and eastern europe , but concerns about its political implications linger . 
  i did n't even know about the three seas initiative . 
  this is interesting . 
  and apparently it 's not seen in the best of light by some in brussels . 
  that makes no sense . 
   we need to tie germany into us more , integrate their manufactury , economy , and military so much that they ca n't disentangle . 
  make their help a legal requirement . 
  that will give us insurance , that will defend us . 
  the american 's will always have one foot out the door .
