  damn . 
  it 'll only be us and the swedes then . 
  nato is not the enemy unless you plan to make it the enemy and with what happened and still happens in ukraine ... we 're pretty sure russia is dedicated to be viewed as a country with an aggressive foreign policy which , if it were n't for nato , could have also waged war in any of their neighbours overnight . 
  we fear you , we 've been proven right many times and we need protection from you . 
  it 's that simple . 
  * do n't they ? 
  woah , chill . 
  i was just pointing out that the name fyrom is not really used a lot , mainly because it 's long , and that if they were forced to change their name , a lot people would still call them what they 're used to calling them because the rest of europe does n't have the same intense feelings about the subject to make the effort . 
  it 's not something against the greeks or anything . 
   people started saying that transylvania is hungarian either . 
  a lot of hungarians say that , unfortunately . 
  there has always been tension over that . 
  it 's from tumblr . 
  no one , at least here , really calls macedonia fyrom or anything else . 
  for us it 's macedonia . 
  context has to be really , really formal for someone to use fyrom . 
  it 's a goddamn long name and always being called `` former x republic '' sounds weird . 
  i also do n't know how macedonians feel about being called `` former republic of yugoslavia '' because i do n't know what feelings they have towards yugoslavia and their time in it . 
  i 'm not knowledgeable about that . 
  so yeah , you can force a name change on them , but a lot of people who always called them macedonia will still call them that . 
  it 's a bit similar with czech republic . 
  it seems a huge thing for them to be called czechia , but they 've always been czechia here . 
  then i give up . 
  anyway , it surely is n't something i have n't heard before . 
  haha . 
  yeah , i admit it was surprising maia got as much as she did , but i do n't know ... like people already knew who dodon was . 
  he had all sorts of crazy ideas even before this . 
  maybe my initial comment was a bit salty considering romania 's situation too , but i 'm just really angry that he 's getting away with so much shit . 
  what do moldovans say ? 
  any protests ? 
  we do n't hear much over here . 
  wait ... 
  i think i might be connecting the dots . 
  was that a jab at bucharest on how we 're all gypsies ? 
  cause it ca n't be about moldovans even though it usually is . 
  now you got ta explain . 
  i need to know what i was insulted about . 
  haha . 
  thank you . 
   i do n't look different hungarians do n't look different though ? 
  like they 're not indians or something . 
  of course you do n't look different . 
  do n't think i 'd be able to tell a romanian and hungarian apart if they did n't open their mouths . 
   i 'm more into romanianess than most bucharesters  not sure what this means . 
  just curious so do n't take it offensively : do you feel romanian at all ? 
  i mean , i know there must be something , because you speak the language , but i mean generally ? 
  i 've heard him on tv just now ... all i can say is that he is who the moldovan people voted for . 
  a * moldovan * president who offers no solutions to their problems and barely even speaks the country 's language anymore . 
  a putin loving cockroach . 
  well , good luck moldova !, 
  we have a street and a high-school named after him . 
  hungary 's own erdogan . 
  i posted an article with a similar theme back when erdogan was going after g\u00fclen . 
   you could cut off everything east and south of germany and nato would n't be realistically weakened . 
  overall , you seem to be pretty supportive of soviet invasion and occupation , as if you 're trying to justify it somehow . 
  `` oh come one , it was n't that bad . 
  they only occupied , stole , raped and murdered their way through your country . 
  but it 's okay because *** i think *** you were a shithole anyway . 
  look at all the good things the su has done . '', 
  it is pretty simple : we did not want to be part of the war , but we were dragged into it by the soviet union . 
  if we would have been left alone , we 'd be a better country today . 
  same with moldova , which is a much more complex subject . 
  moldova would have been better off being a part of our country , there 's no debating that . 
   and what have soviets done to romania that surpasses what they did to poland for example ? 
  come on . 
  this ai n't a competition . 
  poland has been butchered by both germany and the su and they are right to be wary of the russians . 
  the germans , at least , tried to make amends . 
  yes , germany fucked us too , not as bad as the su knowing the war outcome , but they did trick us . 
  but , at the end of the day , the soviet union occupied us for 15 years and we had one of the toughest communist regimes for 50 . 
  blood was spilled to get rid of it . 
  what the soviet union did to us , to the moldovans , to the people living in those areas ... plain horror . 
  and the effects ( political , social , economical , etc. ), 
  are still there today . 
  moldova , at the very least , is a mess . 
  i 'm not trying to defend what romania did as an ally to germany , and i 'm talking about the holocaust , what we did when in our short time as a fascist country was horrible . 
  but at least we 're trying to make amends to these people . 
  i will never put the soviet union anywhere near a positive column . 
  they have dragged us down so much . 
  we initially wanted to be neutral . 
  france fell and the su then issued a ultimatum and annexed our lands in 1940 . 
  then the fascist ** coup ** happened and we allied ourselves with germany against the soviet union and we did invade them . 
  they are the ones who provoked that . 
   of all eastern european countries that russia took over or wronged in some way , romanians have by far the least right to be sore . 
  yeah , no . 
  yeah . 
  that 's what it means . 
   is n't that logical ? 
  if your neighbors started buying guns and installing firing positions in their houses because they 're afraid of you , would n't you be concerned ? 
  well , i 'd mainly be concerned as to why those countries think i will attack them . 
  we have a saying here ... `` if 10 people tell you you 're drunk , it 's time for you to go to bed . '', 
  but we 're both clever enough to know that russian leaders are well aware of what they 're playing at . 
  you 're damn right it 's in our blood to be wary of the russians . 
  all they ever did to us throughout history was fucked up . 
  i do n't know why that would surprise you . 
  if i kept abusing you occasionally , would n't you fear i 'd start beating you again , especially if i 'd say so multiple times ? 
  would n't you find ways to protect yourself ? 
  logical , no ? 
  we do not have american masters . 
  we 're just not willing to be your puppets anymore .
