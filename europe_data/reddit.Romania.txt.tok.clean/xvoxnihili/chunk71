  ** pnl ** ( national liberals ) - honestly , quite the mess . 
  not as corrupt as psd , but they have their problems . 
  i think a bigger problem with pnl is the fact that they do n't know what to do with themselves anymore . 
  like they have no idea . 
  anyway , they 're a historical party in romania and they 're voted by both older and younger people who have some liberal notions but do retain some conservative views as well . 
  the name of the party says it all . 
  it was basically the main alternative to psd until usr showed up . 
  ** usr ** ( save romania union ) - new party that contains contains both right wing and left wing people . 
  syncretic politics basically . 
  this has affected the party recently , being unable to have a proper stance regarding certain subjects as members had different views . 
  their main cause is fighting corruption and promoting transparency . 
  they 're mostly voted by young people from urban areas . 
  ** udmr ** ( democratic alliance of hungarians in romania ) - hungarian minority party currently in coalition with psd . 
  less corrupt than psd , but still a sort of hungarian psd . 
  unlike psd , they can scream `` discrimination policy '' if the dna ( anti corruption directorate ) catches one of their members with some shady business . 
  since they 're a small party , usually only voted by the hungarian minority , they try to enter ruling coalitions to support their policies , which usually are about the hungarian minority . 
  ** alde ** ( alliance of liberals and democrats ) - small party which is always in cahoots with psd . 
  i do n't even know what to tell you about them other than that they 're corrupt as well and are not like the european alde . 
  their leader even made some anti eu comments which got him a lot of criticism . 
  i do n't even know who votes for them or why . 
  for me they 're just a party which helps psd make coalitions in parliament for majority . 
  ** pmp ** ( people 's movement party ) - a pretty traditionalist party led by former president basescu . 
  they support the reunification with moldova and stuff like that . 
  if we are n't confused with gypsies , we 're still called ( not by everyone obviously ) poor , uneducated , etc. 
  romanians are disliked as well , just not as much as gypsies . 
  home alone ... jesus do they ever get tired of playing that movie every goddamn year . 
  same with titanic though . 
  1 ) grading is from 1 to 10 . 
  10 is best , 1 worst . 
  you need a 5 minimum to pass a class and the bacalaureat ( national exam at the end of high-school , 12th grade ) has to be passed with at least a 6 , but that 's a whole other discussion . 
  to explain better how grading works throughout the two semesters we have here , i 'll use an example : you have a certain subject . 
  you have to have , say , at least 3 marks throughout the semester ( random number , number of marks needed vary based on the importance of the subject , can go from 2 to even 7 ) . 
  at the end of semesters , those 3 marks are added up ( 7 +7 +10 = 24 ) and divided by the number of marks ( 24/3 = 8 ) . 
  at the end of the year , the marks for each of the two semesters are added up and divided again to give you the yearly mark for that specific subject/class . 
  2 ) high-school students are divided by field : - mathematics and computer programming - earth studies - more biology and stuff like that . 
  - philology - social studies , languages , etc. 
  - vocational programs - music , art , etc. 
  - economical programs - may have forgotten one or two , but those are the most important ones i think . 
  now all these students have most of the same classes despite being different fields . 
  the difference is how many hours of a subject they have per week and whether or not certain subjects are compulsory for all of the 4 years of high-school or not . 
  to explain that , a student who 's in the mathematics and computer programming field will not only have more math and technology lessons per week than a philology student , but math is compulsory for all of the 4 years for him , while the philology student only has math classes for two years out of four . 
  to clarify how this is done : philology students and math students are not in the same classroom . 
  most high-schools have a class for each field . 
  for example class 12a might be a math class while 12b can be a philology class . 
  3 ) there are no advanced classes , just optional courses . 
  4 ) yes . 
  5 ) there are optional classes outside of the mandatory ones . 
  6 ) there is definitely homework here . 
   5 to 10 years ago there was a vocal minority in slovakia that was openly hostile towards hungarians . 
  the epitome of the entire movement was jan slota , a drunken idiot , who was also a politician of the slovak national party . 
  in his drunken rants he threatened to get into tanks and level budapest to the ground and bragged about how hungarians came here on donkeys . 
  we had a guy like this too . 
  hungarians must be thinking `` basescu '' , but nah . 
  basescu was a child compared to this one who 's similar to what you 're describing . 
   though that sentiment is dying along with our older generation so you do n't hear much about it nowadays . 
  the slovak national party is even in coalition with most-hid which is a hungarian minority party right now . 
  i think a part of it might be that there is a new boogeyman nowadays in the mena migrants . 
  our ( most corrupt and biggest ) ruling party is also in coalition with our hungarian minority party . 
  huh . 
  such similarities . 
  - russians are still disliked and they 're probably going to be disliked for a very long time . 
  - hungarians are mostly ignored nowadays if they do n't start talking about #revisetrianon and stuff like that . 
  there is some dislike and suspicion towards them though , but not from everyone . 
  granted , they do n't like us very much either . 
  just yesterday a hungarian answered a similar question here saying we 're viewed , and i quote , as * a backstabbing bunch * . 
  - gypsies are still not liked . 
  but we are a very disliked minority ourselves . 
  more than poles and bulgarians , less than gypsies ( but this does n't matter as most confuse us with them so yeah ) . 
  my friends , family and a lot of conationals have experienced xenophobia while traveling . 
  even people from countries like cee countries , where our burden should be more understood , can act hateful towards us . 
  i think the situation might worsen a bit between us and hungary . 
  what would happen is that we have to consider that many times , in the east , the eu is a fighter against corruption and russian influence . 
  some states may able to stay strong against corruption , but russian influence would definitely grow and that could cause all sorts of tensions , not only between the eastern states and russia , but between the eastern states themselves . 
  there would be friendliness , but not the same as when we were member states and had to cooperate anyway . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  then again , afaik , bulgaria has received a lot of refugees . 
  i heard around 25k . 
  how are things going with them ? 
  yes , but not enforced i think . 
  tennis most probably . 
  handball too . 
  serbia : we 've never had problems with them , but we do n't have much of a relationship either . 
  personally , i think their government is a bit too russia friendly for my taste . 
  otherwise i 'm sure they 're nice people . 
  bulgaria : i mean ... brolgaria . 
  hungary : remove magyar , they iz of worst . 
  i 'm kidding . 
  there is some animosity , but some people also get along . 
  it 's all fine and dandy until someone mentions #revisetrianon . 
  ukraine : we do n't interact much , we 've had some teritorial issues , but it 's in the past . 
  we support them in their way to eu/nato . 
  moldova : missing : child abducted by russians . 
  child developed split personality . 
  at times it shows signs of stockholm syndrome too . 
   wait what ? 
  in romania i always hear how bulgaria is tackling corruption and other matters better . 
  i think it 's a conspiracy so we both get better . 
  never heard that . 
  romania is doing better . 
  granted , the eu did not give bulgaria the push to have their own dna so that might be a reason .
