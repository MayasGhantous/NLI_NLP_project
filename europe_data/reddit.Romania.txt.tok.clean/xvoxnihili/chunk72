   we also have great relations with serbia , we do n't have any problems with serbia , but we do n't have much of a relation with them . 
  what ? 
  i 've never seen a hungarian on this website say anything bad of austria . 
  i think they kinda love you guys . 
  some even want to ... get back together . 
  haha, 
  thank you !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoqox-o5vp8 ) . 
  aggressive in what sense ? 
  well not only saxons but among our minority groups : saxons , hungarians , gypsies , turks , etc. , saxons are the most liked . 
  they have a rich culture here . 
  our president is a transylvanian saxon . 
  it is easier to asses who 's liked more when it comes to historical communities rather than what immigrants from which country are liked more . 
  most liked : saxons . 
  most disliked : gypsies . 
  i have never changed my opinion on / r/europe . 
  poland itself voted for the quota and then refused to respect the decision taken by the majority . 
  they have the choice of either being sanctioned or abiding by the vote . 
  besides that , they 're also dealing with a government that abuses its power to break the rule of law . 
  rule of law is a fundamental principle held by the eu . 
  i do n't hate poland or poles , i just have my own opinion . 
  there was indeed a change of tone tho . 
  i 've received lots of downvotes because of my opinions , but it did n't change my view . 
  last year , things were different . 
  that not enough russians dislike their government/putin to make a change . 
  and lol @ downvoting me . 
  all i stated were facts . 
  just came from the town . 
  had a few drinks with some friends . 
  we were always , and we still are to a degree , a agriculture focused country . 
  we were n't dirt poor , but we were n't very rich either . 
  during the interwar period we were top oil exporters in the world and that 's what later led to it playing a important part in the german war machine . 
  and yeah , we have a brutal history . 
  honestly , we have so many chances of developing so much , but some people and some politicians just want to see the world burn . 
  i think we did alright . 
  poland did better but they were closer to the west and we had a bit of a tougher regime over here . 
  still not enough . 
  we 'd actually be doing much better right now if it were n't for some stupid people and corrupt politicians . 
  yes . 
  and we were the only people who got out of communism violently , through a revolution . 
  but we actually did n't have access to the outside non communist world , we barely knew what democracy meant , but we did know that whatever we had , it was n't freedom . 
  today 's russians have the access and all the examples they need . 
  `` are you a turk ? '', 
  - do you not understand anything ? 
  `` rome was n't build in a day '' `` to drown like a gypsy at the shore '' - to not be able to finish something , see something through . 
  `` indian queue '' `` to smoke like a turk '' - to smoke a lot . 
  `` big as a russian tank '' `` french kiss '' `` speak chinese '' - not understand what one says . 
   `` in rome do as the romans do ''  `` rome was n't build in a day ''  `` all the roads lead to rome '' i think we have these too , especially the * rome was n't build in a day *, 
  how is x in power in the first place ? 
   and please , do not tell me that putin is in power while no one in russia supports him . 
  would make some people quite angry and it probably would n't be respected . 
  nonsense , casual drinking is part of the european culture . 
  well , i did have the opportunity as i attended a debate in bucharest part of the citizens ' dialogues . 
  i did n't ask him anything , i listened , but if i had to ask , i would have asked about how can we , romanians , trust the two tier eu considering the schengen problem , especially since one of the main subjects of the debate was juncker 's white paper . 
  but juncker ultimately said that he really hopes to see romania in schengen by 2019 . 
  it 's a problem that should have been solved , like , yesterday , but meh . 
  it 's called bucur low floor apparently from what i see on wiki , but it does n't have a regular model name .

  this man knows things . 
  i do n't drink coffee . 
  tea for me . 
  or wine . 
  or beer . 
  oops . 
  yes . 
  them too . 
  yes . 
  there was a specific woman who would always offer to read my palm when i passed by her . 
  yeah ... no , thanks . 
  they root verbally for our football team . 
  they do not try to hide it . 
  just be careful with taxis , some scumbags who see you 're a foreigner tend to try to overcharge you , but there are certain taxi services you can use to prevent that . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/wiki/travel ) our travel guide where you 'll find some tips and you can ask / r/romania if there something you did not find . 
  the social democrats , alde , pru ( far right party that did n't make it in the parliament ) . 
  shhhh romanian best latin anything haha . 
  i 'm just bored . 
  romanian best latin accent ^ ^ / s, 
   it seems that racism especially in organized groups is becoming more prevalent well how did you come to this conclusion and can we see some sources ? 
  most of the historical community , the tatars , live in the dobrogea region . 
  they 're cool afaik . 
  as for turks who have come here recently , most of them own small business and they 're okay . 
  the result of the erdogan referendum was overall `` no '' here . 
  i wish they did . 
  they always end up coming to cities to look for food nowadays . 
  of course that economically speaking it is better than our currency because it has more value , but the rest i do n't know since we do n't use euros yet . 
  no , not just americans , but generally the west and the north seem to think blue eyes and blond hair should be the beauty standard . 
  oh jeez , y' all sure love blue eyed blondes a lot . 
  ** - go to hell !, 
  ** - shit !, 
  ** - to hell !, 
  ( literally ) ** pula mea . . ** - my dick . 
  speaking of this there was a comedian talking about how romanians use `` pula mea '' as punctuation . 
  i do n't use this as much as i did in my teen years . 
  what i do say on a daily basis is `` ce dracu ? '', 
  which means `` what the hell ? 
  at the moment , i 'd say psd + the economy = disaster . 
  ~ ~ been there , done that and it did n't work out as good as you 'd think ~ ~ oh , i see , serbia is looking to be liberated and get some freedom . 
  [ done . 
  we cooperate a lot with the us , more than some countries in the area , but i wish we 'd be considered a bit more equal . 
  what about us ?
