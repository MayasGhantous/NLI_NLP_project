  not very good because it does n't have enough content . 
  there 's a lot of popular shows that are on the american netflix , but not on ours . 
  bad luck . 
  i think southern countries are friendlier . 
  bucharest and cluj . 
  bucharest is the capital so it 's smug while cluj wants to be the capital and it 's like `` we 're so much better than bucharest '' . 
  it 's basically a circlejerk nowadays . 
  as for most smug country ... 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe uk and the netherlands ? 
  the netherlands more specifically towards us , politically at least . 
  it can be common as many fled there during and right after communism . 
  yes , true . 
  probably wwii which in turn led to the romanian holocaust , losing basarabia ( which endured russification ) , communism , soviet occupation , deportations , etc. 
  that 's ... infuriating . 
  and it happens a lot . 
  for example , a university student was denied stay in hotel somewhere in western europe ( i forgot which country it was ) because they thought that since she 's a romanian , she must be a prostitute . 
  - saying or asking if romania is a slavic country or if we 're slavs . 
  - confusing bucharest with budapest . 
  - acting surprised that romania is not one big ghetto where people are starving on the streets and getting stabbed or whatever . 
  - assuming we 're roma . 
  a very small percent of romanians are ethnically roma . 
  romania gets painted as balkan far more than you do even if , geographically , slovenia is more balkan than romania . 
  romania 's national animal is the lynx and i do like it . 
  i like felines . 
  probably bulgaria . 
  i mean moldova 's our sister and all , but she 's not exactly stable right now . 
  what ? 
  you mean you did n't want to get bananas and oranges only at christmas and have like a couple of minutes of cartoons a day ? 
  weird . 
  maybe i 'd pick bra\u0219ov or sibiu . 
  what about [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ybicd43mc ) ? 
  i think so . 
  they really would n't stay in romania if they were n't , especially since we 're close to three countries with many more muslims than we 'll ever have ( bih , albania and turkey ) . 
  the face veil is n't illegal here , but then again i 've never seen a muslim woman wearing the face veil . 
  they usually just wear hijabs . 
  [ hora unirii ] ( https://youtu.be/jeuftba6ze8?t=22 ) or union hora ( hora being a type of traditional dance here ) . 
  here 's the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_hora ) . 
  that 's weird . 
  you 've never seen one person with a hijab in your life ? 
  i see them weekly . 
  i even see them in the bucharest sector where i live and it 's like one of least popular sectors . 
  very popular in romania . 
  many families make their own for the winter . 
  like [ this ] ( http://scms.machteamsoft.ro/uploads/photos/652x450/652x450_032694-muraturi.jpg ) . 
  i mostly eat pickled cucumber , pickled green tomatoes , pickled peppers , small pickled watermelons . 
   but simply because they 're not geographically located in the east . 
  i 'd like to see any of these stuck up central europeans , baltic people , whatever , ever get this offended for being put in the western european category because you make it seem like their only problem is geographical inaccuracy which is absolute bullshit . 
  how stupid do you think we are ? 
  no need to go to another country for it ( although some people go to bulgaria because it 's apparently cheaper and they have nicer service ) , the breeze , just the beauty of the black sea . 
  negative ? 
  many domestic tourists who are jerk . 
  i thought lithuanians were first in alcohol consumption , czechs second and romanians third . 
  that 's the last statistic i saw on / r/europe . 
  anyway , alcohol is part of many cultures so while i do believe that some exaggerate with drinking , i do n't think it 's that bad to drink if you do it with measure . 
  1st december . 
  yes , we do celebrate it . 
  military parade and all that jazz . 
  what made you put slovakia and hungary in different parts ? 
  lithuania also beats us in suicides so no wonder . 
  russia and romania in the same group ? 
  * [ take this ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/05/17/which-eu-state-is-the-world-s-heaviest-drinking-country ) , poland !, 
  * we say as we 're dying from liver cancer . 
  yeah , but it 's not like in the us where you 're seen as scum for not tipping . 
  i 've seen so many fights over this . 
  many in us view you as very , very bad if you do n't tip . 
  i usually leave something , but if i 'm not pleased with the service , fuck tipping . 
  this is a great response . 
  i approve . 
  i would rather have `` mad people driving on bad roads '' or `` alcoholics '' . 
  never heard of these :  rusnac , muscal : russian ( second is antiquated )  rusnac , hahol : ukrainian and personally never heard the `` ceafa-lata '' used for bulgarians , but i did hear `` frunte lata/mare '' used for moldovans . 
  never heard of the polish one and neamt is not derogatary . 
  it 's literally the nationality . 
  never heard frantuz being used a derogatory either . 
   cygan ( `` gypsy '' ) - romanians ah , the cultured people of poland . 
  lol, 
  np , it 's okay . 
  greater france . 
  love this !, 
  we 're actually southeastern europe . 
  the poor part ... very nice . 
  there are quite a few chinese people here in bucharest . 
  i 've never heard someone saying something negative about them though . 
  putting salt on watermelon sounds so weird . 
  i have never heard of this before . 
  it 's not dealt with mostly . 
  most common i 've heard is rus , rusu ( russian ) , s\u00e2rbu ( serbian ) , moldovan ( moldovan ) , turcu ( turkish ) , ungureanu ( hungarian ) and there might be some more , but that 's all i remember now . 
  romanians confirmed as satanists . 
  lol we use expressions with `` hell '' , `` devil '' or `` devil 's mother '' a lot . 
  we have that too actually . 
  as a curse though . 
  for example : `` go in your mother 's pussy ! '', 
  or , like you said , simply `` your mother 's pussy ! '', 
  *** a vinde gogo\u015fi *** which literally translates to *** selling doughnuts *** but it is also use as a way to say that someone is lying . 
  / / our politicians are the most sincere people . 
  / / come on , stop selling me doughnuts . 
  -- *** frec\u0163ie la picior de lemn *** which literally translates to *** rubbing a wooden leg *** which is a way to say that something is useless . 
  / / using natural remedies for a serious disease is like rubbing a wooden leg . 
  -- *** la mama naibii *** which literally translates to *** at the devil 's mother *** and is a vulgar way of saying something is far away . 
  / / where are you ?
