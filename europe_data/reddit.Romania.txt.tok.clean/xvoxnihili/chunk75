  i just watched civil war again and i 'm coming over with bitter feelings about this one . 
  and no , afaik , we do n't .

  #\u0ca0 _ \u0ca0 ~ ~ are you polish ? ~ ~, 
  nope . 
  latin music is popular here , especially at parties . 
  artists like daddy yankee , enrique iglesias , thalia and the like used to be quite popular when i was younger , maybe they still are . 
  i , myself , am guilty of humming [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxi8rqyc36q ) because of how much it was on tv . 
  disclaimer : i do n't speak spanish , but my sister does . 
  she translates for me sometimes and i 'm like `` sounds like something i probably would n't listen to in romanian '' , but because it is in spanish and i do n't know the language , it sounds better . 
  i guess the lyrics are n't extremely clever , but rhythm can be nice sometimes . 
  it 's , after all , music that people move to at parties . 
  i 'd rather hear latin music than `` manele '' * shudders * . 
  you fool , the nazis were the aliens . 
  they are on the dark side of the moon !!!, 
  everyone knows that !, 
  i pay around 3 euros for unlimited national/international minutes , and unlimited data . 
  yes , that would be great . 
  we 'd be able to be bigger players taken more seriously . 
  if we could get our shit together internally , we 'd manage it too . 
  we were supposed to be in schengen 6 years ago , but we 've been denied even though we met the criteria . 
  i really hope they do n't makes us mad by letting croatia in before us . 
  we 've paid a lot of money into meeting the criteria and waited enough for this . 
  jcj said he 'd like to see us enter asap , but who knows . 
  i do n't know when we 'll be joining the euro though . 
  not a thing in my city afaik . 
  every kid was just leaving to the countryside to their grandparents . 
  i did n't have any relatives in the countryside so many times i was alone during summers stuck in bucharest , but going to the seaside with family was fun . 
  the avengers / ca with sebastian stan i guess . 
  probably amsterdam . 
  ah , you 're a generous man . 
  that must have been awkward as hell . 
  most support for unification is in romania while moldova leans towards `` no '' . 
  moldova , though , has a big russian ethnic minority , territorial integrity issues and the moldovans have been fed propaganda for years . 
  their new president , dodon , is anti eu and anti romania , even though we help them with a lot , but to be fair he did n't win with a landslide . 
  to quote myself from a previous discussion about this :  to be honest , basarabia ( moldova ) was stolen from us a long time ago and because the unification did not happen quickly after communism fell , disparities of all sorts grew as time passed . 
   i do n't think the unification will happen , not in the current geopolitical situation at least , but i think romania will support moldova 's path to become a functional democracy and we will also support moldova 's relationship with the eu . 
   there is also a transylvania county in north carolina  what 's that ? 
   moldova is a different country , is it considered culturally part of romania ? 
  i 'm talking about the part of moldova that is still in romania aka [ western moldova ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/moldova_regiune.png ) . 
  the country moldova was also part of romania until we were forced to cede it to the soviets . 
  food , accents , traditional clothing / music , customs and history differ from region to region . 
  the main regions are wallachia , transylvania , moldova and dobrogea . 
  i used to have two red eared slider turtles if that counts . 
  alternatively , some people go to greece or bulgaria instead of our own beaches . 
  coliv\u0103 which is a sweet ritual food served after somebody dies . 
  i was saying that because he did not include the rest of latin countries in europe .

   southern europe + france thanks norway . 
  i thought nudity in portugal would be just as okay as in spain . 
  i imagined italians to be slightly more conservative , but spanish and portuguese to be all about the freedom to display your body . 
  i think that yes , latin countries are more romantic , more `` sensual '' if you want to put it that way , but you ca n't make a comparison between latin countries in europe/rest of europe as easy as us/latin america . 
  this actually reminded me of a documentary about europeans where , jokingly , italians are described as `` people who always look like they just had sex '' . 
  haha . 
  one of the inside jokes in the romanian subreddit is about cluj . 
  some people from cluj think of it as a small silicon valley and how it 's the best city in romania at everything . 
  the rest of us make fun of them because they do n't have a metro and every time something bad happens in cluj , the rest of us are like , `` oh my god . 
  how could this possibly happen in this silicon valley paradise ? '', 
  just to make fun of them . 
  yeah , i do n't even know how that song became so popular abroad . 
  haha . 
  ahahahha , that was a great video . 
  thank you for sharing !, 
  yeah , we did because french media has a habit of mocking us and we 're pretty sick of it , especially since it comes from france , a country which quite a few feel close to due to our historical ties . 
  speaking of , i hope that guy who mocked romanians ( saying that the romanian salute is extending your hand and saying `` s\u2019il vous plait , messieurs '' ) on french television was fined too because i do n't remember if he was or was n't . 
  / u/idkfa _ cz has made some good points . 
  i mean , some students are proud that they go to the best university in the city or country , but it only boils down to `` jeez , i learned so much , i 'm so glad i got here '' and that 's it . 
  this pride is n't shown through clothing or stuff like that . 
  social media like facebook is considered public space here so you can get in trouble for hate speech if someone reports you to the police . 
  hate speech in romania is usually defined by incitement to hatred of any kind : xenophobia , racism , discrimination based on religion , sexual orientation and the like . 
  it 's especially bad if you also incite people to violence . 
  we also have this :  promoting the culture of persons guilty of committing a crime against peace and humanity or promoting fascist , racist or xenophobic ideology , through propaganda , committed by any means , in public , is punishable by imprisonment from 6 months to 5 years and the loss of certain rights . 
  the reason you might see people being critical of islam ( using hate speech and burning the quran , etc. ), 
  be arrested is because some countries also have blasphemy laws . 
  i have never seen a person wearing university clothing in my life .

  i do n't really have a favorite , but i like music from these bands/artists : nirvana , the doors , scorpions , placebo , pink floyd , led zeppelin , queen , tarja , ac/dc , billy idol , guns n roses , the beatles , red hot chili peppers , arctic monkeys . 
  a moderate weather for one . 
  i 'm just saying this because i 'm currently melting . 
  generally , politicians that give a fuck . 
  where are you from ? 
  band of brothers was awesome , but from the hbo war series my favorite still is generation kill . 
  gk did n't try to push the whole american hero bullshit and that 's exactly what most hollywood movies do . 
  inglorious basterds was funny , a sort of different outcome to a nasty war where the bitch gets to burn . 
  right now we do n't have a big jewish community anymore , we have around 3000 jews i think , but like i mentioned in another reply , we used to have almost 1m jews before wwii , more than pretty much any country in western europe .
