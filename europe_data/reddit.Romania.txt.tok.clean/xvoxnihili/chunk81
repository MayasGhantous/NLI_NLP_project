  oh , no , i like the finland flag too . 
  told you i forgotten some . 
  haha . 
  your flag is just as great . 
  and the rest i like , but are not favorites . 
  it 's a win win anyway . 
  my favorite european flags ( in no particular order ) : - eu flag - czech republic - albania - iceland - norway - sweden - denmark - france - the netherlands + their old flag - serbia - ireland - slovenia - luxembourg - estonia - germany non european flags : - canada - barbados might have forgotten some . 
  russia can into tricking ... russia trick everyone !!!, 
  lol, 
  that 's awesome . 
  does something happen on this day or do just friends prank each other ? 
  lol @ that link . 
  haha . 
  and sorry , i misread that . 
  haha !, 
  true . 
  i 'm glad your politicians afaik do n't propagate this belief . 
  because ever since the communists russia was n't a democracy and many russian leaders have found out that they actually like it this way better . 
  they can control the masses better . 
  russia has also been going down since the soviet union and when you have an external enemy to blame it is easier to keep the people from wondering whether or not russian leaders were the cause . 
  another thing is that russia does n't want to accept the idea that they 're not equal in power to the west anymore . 
  sure , they have nukes , but it is n't all about nukes and they 're not on the west 's level anyway . 
  all i can say : poland should know better than this . 
  most of us romanians do n't say anything bad about poles and actually sympathize when you 're being mocked and called bad names by some westerners and yet ... 
  it 's a real shame . 
  ah , nah ... that was a joke from the german `` germany welcomes trump in his own words '' where the narrator says something like `` and if you want to drop a bomb on us , this is how germany looks like on a map . 
  ( shows italy instead ) '' . 
  i was making a joke because he implied we are best friends with russia . 
  haha . 
  some poles informed me on reddit that `` rumun '' ( romanian ) is or used to be not to long ago a synonym for filthy , beggar , thief , etc. 
  that `` rumun '' is used as an insult . 
  a lot of romanians had no idea this happened in poland , but more than one polish person confirmed it . 
  they said it got better recently , but yeah . 
  they forgot about us , mock us and they 're only friends with hungary . 
  nah , man , bulgaria is alright . 
  unlike a certain country which forgot that we were friends once and that we helped them during the war . 
  hey putin/trump , if you ever want to bomb us , [ this is what romania looks like on a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/croatia_in_europe_%28-rivers_-mini_map%29.svg/1198px-croatia_in_europe_%28-rivers_-mini_map%29.svg.png ) . 
  * looks at the black sea * bae < 3, 
  1st of december - great union day . 
  i 'm not overreacting , but it does get tiring , i 'm sure you agree . 
   anti-hungarian rhetoric is always strong before elections and then everything goes back to normal afterwards . 
  actually udmr ( hu party ) is in a coalition with the current ruling party . 
   one thing i remember is when an ex-president ( maybe basescu ? ), 
  mentioned that romania 's border should be at the tisza last december . 
  yeah , he did say that , but most people do n't even take him seriously anymore . 
  his party got like 5 % . 
  almost did n't pass the threshold , but moldovans vote for pmp because they support reunification . 
   and this also affects the amount of `` shit '' each government will start . 
  yeah , sure , which is why is better if we all stop . 
  those people are also affected by tensions . 
   i do n't think any big gestures need to be done at this point , things are definitely moving along fine . 
  from what i remember from the 1990s , the situation is lightyears better . 
  of course it 's better than it used to be , i do n't deny that . 
  i just hope that one day we come to a point where such things only happen among the very small ( hopefully for the future ) groups of extremists or nationalists or nostalgics or whatever . 
  like i said in my original post , i am very glad when our politicians choose to react mildly ( still react , but very diplomatically ) to whatever new thing some hungarian politician has to say about us because there 's no point in escalating it . 
   btw did n't we already discuss this a few weeks ago ? 
  maybe ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm forgetful sometimes . 
  maybe we did . 
  when was the last time we started shit ? 
  for example , until the diplomats incident and the `` dna is attacking hungarian politicians '' accusation , no one spoke of hungary for a while as far as i remember ( not only do i spend a lot of time listening to the news , but i also check our subreddit which also has hungarians or people from transylvania who 'd definitely post if something happened , but maybe i did n't see something ) , but every now and again orban or his ? vice pm ? 
  say something and we 're like '' ??? again ??? '' . 
  but if you have examples of romanian politicians ( government or parliament ) starting shit out of nowhere recently then you can share of course . 
  as someone said ... maybe we should really sign a pact like france and germany did . 
  and if we can not be friends ever ( as countries ) , at least completely ignore each other and act like we do n't exist to one another because i feel like this will never ever stop . 
   all in all , i would not really call it rivalry , rather it is a passive-aggressive relationship . 
  maybe . 
  it 's not as bad as turkey and greece at least . 
  orban has n't yet declared war on romania . 
  haha . 
  jk with the last part . 
  ha , love the description . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm still not sure whether you and the swedes hate each other or it 's just banter . 
  care to enlighten me ? 
  it depends on personal opinion/feelings , experiences and location , yes . 
  i do n't hate hungarians or anything , but what i hate about hungary is their politicians being openly hostile towards romania . 
  their hvim group is also hateful . 
  we have a couple of dickheads too like our former president traian basescu , but generally , hungary is the one to start shit and our politicians have learned recently not to overreact ( enter a declarations war ) even though there is some stuff that needs to be said . 
  we try to ignore them as much as we can so tensions wo n't escalate . 
  other people , especially those who live in transylvania , are more mellow with their views towards hungary and all that , but even a lot of them agree that hungary 's politicians ( along with some of our own like tb ) are idiots . 
  and you should see what happens when there 's a football match . 
  haha . 
  the balkans have quite a few problems . 
  then you have : - hungary and romania . 
  - turkey and greece . 
  the worst is probably ukraine and russia right now . 
  [ pia\u0163a universit\u0103\u0163ii ] ( http://bucharestinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aerial-view-over-universitatii-square.jpg ) aka university square . 
  it 's where [ the km 0 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilometre_zero_ ( bucharest ) ) is and where many historical or important events took place . 
  do you want free movement with crocodiles and giant spiders ? 
  at first i thought mark was in love with juliet 's husband , but then the scene where he leaves her in his apartment broke my heart into pieces . 
  eu flags are on almost every official building i think . 
  recently we also made [ the human eu flag ] ( http://assets.euractiv.com/lazy-load/img/crop/16x9/666.65625/http://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/c5nd9texeaen72e-800x450.jpg ) and had [ an event for march for europe ] ( https://vid.me/5uje ) . 
  there was also [ this ] ( http://promoa3.antena3.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/img_2399-1024x682.jpg ) . 
  well , you know the stereotypes about my country so obviously i 'm not too happy about them . 
  definitely better than the clown you have right now . 
  yes , we 're in a competition and we 're here to win . 
  go big or go home , losers !!!, 
  no , but seriously ...
