  i expected a lot of shit from this government , but this was a whole new level of ... 
  i do n't even know what to call it . 
  i do n't know how we 'll survive the next 3 years and 9 months . 
  we may need therapy afterwards , if we 're not going to reach lithuania 's suicide rate . 
  and just last night psd leader posted a picture mocking our protests . 
  by the way , someone made [ this ] ( https://vid.me/2nck ) when the protests were still heated . 
  god am i chatty tonight . 
  romanians like eating traditional food afaik . 
  we share [ a maritime border with crimea ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/07/article-2575419-1c1d7de900000578-732_634x551.jpg ) and russia 's very interested in the black sea region so i do n't know ... [ this shows the line that separates ukraine 's waters from romania 's . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/resolve.png ),

  ^ ^ psd ^ ^ = ^ ^ romanian ^ ^ social ^ ^ democratic ^ ^ party . 
  - social democrats aka the mafia . 
  - instability in the eu which can lead to its disappearance . 
  thanks . 
  got the main idea behind the issue by google translate . 
  well , it 's good you have a better government now . 
  good luck !, 
  what does that even mean ? 
  `` norwegian politician is shunned and called a pig after he was caught misspending / stealing one krone from public money . 
  this is unacceptable !, 
  the man has resigned after one of the country 's biggest scandals and is barred for life from politics . '',

  the other romanian in this thread says romanians do n't have anything against russian citizens . 
  i think that at some point you have to start putting some responsibility on the russian citizens because not only they elect putin , they endorse putin . 
  so yeah , i 'm not very fond of that idea either . 
  of course i 'm not going to simply hate them , but i think having something against them , or better said some of them , is justifiable . 
  it 's not like putin is only harming russia . 
   how have things changed in the last 5-10 years ? 
  it 's been worse . 
  our relationship with russia has never been good , but ever since ukraine ...  where will things be 5-10 years from now ? 
  the same if not worse since putin might start other shit . 
   how the media/politicians discuss the topic most of the media/politicians are openly against russia . 
  some might endorse russia , but they 're smart enough not to do it in public . 
   how the people around you discuss the topic mostly everyone i know dislikes russia . 
  yeah . 
  or slovenia as balkan when they 're more geographically balkan than romania . 
  many europeans as in estonians ? 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  we did have some problems with turkey who wanted us to close some schools because they were apparently part of a network set up by erdogan 's enemy fethullah gulen . 
  just going to put some random ones that come to my mind right now : - `` corb la corb nu-\u015fi scoate ochii . '', 
  from latin `` corvus corvo non eruit oculum . '', 
  which translates to `` a raven does not pluck out the eyes of another raven . '', 
  and is usually used to say that accomplices do not sell out one another . 
  which translates to `` he who runs after two rabbits catches none . '', 
  which translates to `` he who digs a hole for another will fall in it himself . '', 
  and it basically means that karma will get you . 
  literally translates to `` outside the fence is painted , inside there 's a leopard . '', 
  basically means that appearances lie and is used in the context when something looks good , but it is n't . 
  which translates to `` the wolf changes its coat but not its habits . '', 
  and is an equivalent of `` the tiger/leopard can not change its stripes/spots . '', 
  which literally means `` a sweet word brings you a lot . '', 
  basically that if you know how to sweet talk someone , it will help you a lot . 
  some people smoke it , but it 's illegal . 
  they 'd usually ask you `` ap\u0103 mineral\u0103 sau ap\u0103 plat\u0103 ? '' . 
  depends . 
  we do n't have us ' house party culture , but there are many who prefer doing house ( apartment ) parties because it 's cheaper and sometimes better . 
  bars/clubs are more popular though . 
  if our former pm , dacian ciolos , will create his own party , i will vote for it . 
  a necessary thing in countries like mine which have been threatened by russia one too many times . 
  i wish we had an army capable of taking on the russians without help , but we do n't . 
  one of the scandinavian countries . 
  it would be nice . 
  it 's not a easy language for non romance speakers and not very popular either . 
  i 'll give it a 7 out of 10 . 
  i was taught uk english , but ended up using us english . 
  1000 years is a lot . 
  there are definitely people living today that are worth mentioning in history books one day , but i 'm not sure they 'll still be a subject in 1000 years . 
  well , besides english , we learn french in from grade 5 to the end of highschool . 
  while a lot of people do n't like it because they have trouble with the pronunciation , [ we are considered a francophone country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organisation_internationale_de_la_francophonie ) . 
  but to answer your question with that i think : no . 
  english is not enough anymore . 
  you 're supposed to at least know some basic english nowadays and , for example , quite a few job offerings require you to know at least one more language besides english . 
  i wear socks when it 's cold enough . 
  i have n't heard that name used in a long time , but yeah , pretty traditional name . 
  and then you have people that are like `` gheorghe , vino aici ! '', 
  no idea , but you hear all sorts of names . 
  my cousin 's german shepherds were called tara and lord . 
  a friend 's dogs are called maya and thor . 
  max is common . 
  bella and lucky are also used often . 
  as a side note , i knew someone who 's cat was called mussolini . 
  just for fun though , they were n't fascists . 
  nope . 
  russia is very much disliked here . 
  how about france and uk 's promises to romania that it will be protected and then they were like `` yeah , uhm , sorry , no can do '' ? 
  we were pretty much forced . 
  there 's no way to remain neutral when you stand where we are . 
  took your quiz . 
  i have no experience with firearms and i also live in a country that wiki says has some of the strictest laws about guns . 
   in order for citizens to obtain a weapon , they must obtain a permit from the police , and must register their weapon once they purchased it . 
  there are several categories of permits , with different requirements and rights , including hunting permits , self-defense permits , sports shooting permits and collectors permits . 
  the only categories of people who are legally entitled to carry a weapon are owners of self-defense permits , magistrates , mps , military forces and certain categories of diplomats . 
  a psychological evaluation is required beforehand in all cases . 
   furthermore , knives with a blade longer than 15 cm are considered weapons and have a similar regime to those of firearms . 
  in order for a hunter to obtain a hunting/gun ownership license , he must spend a certain `` practice time '' with a professional hunter .
