  to obtain a self-defense permit , one must be under witness protection . 
  sporting and collectors licenses require membership in a sport shooting club or collectors ' association , respectively . 
   the amount of ammunition that can be owned is regulated by permit type . 
  sporting permits allow the ownership of 1000 matching cartridges per gun ; hunting permits allow 300 matching cartridges per gun ; self-defense permits allow 50 bullet cartridges and 50 blanks per gun ; collectors permits do not allow for private ownership of ammunition . 
   explosive weapons and ammunitions , fully automatic weapons , weapons camouflaged in the shape of another object , armor-piercing ammunition and lethal weapons that do not fit in any category defined by the law are prohibited . 
  the diminutive for bird ( pas\u0103re ) so like birdie ( p\u0103s\u0103ric\u0103 ) . 
  but how come there is less gun violence in the eu than in the us where everyone has access to guns ? 
  by your logic , there would be more victims of gun violence in the eu because there 's gun laws for normal citizens , but bad guys can get them anyway . 
  ion '' . 
  sf\u00e2nt means saint and sf . 
  is the short term . 
  biserica means church . 
  our far right party is pru ( united romania party ) and last year they got 3 % of the votes which means that they did not get any seats in the parliament due to our 5 % threshold . 
  there 's another far right party , but it 's really dying . 
  they went from 12 % in 2004 to 1.11 % in 2016 . 
  no christian parties here , but we have conservative parties which love to treat the church good cause it gets them votes . 
   my mother had friends who were very active with getting children to ireland from romania , but this may have started after the wall fell , and they told horror stories about conditions there . 
  the children were always very dysfunctional , to begin with , anyway . 
  do you mean children who came from orphanages ? 
  if they were children from romanian communist orphanages than it is estimated that a lot of them had developed mental illnesses because of the inhumane conditions they were kept in . 
  it was one of the most disgusting things i 've learned about communist romania . 
  we call it the tricolor ( tricolorul = the tricolor ) too , but , to be fair , white is not a color so we should get that title . 
  jk , we got the name from france . 
  sure thing . 
  i 'll tell you about romania because maybe situations vary , but there is a communist legacy present in ee nonetheless . 
  long story short : to start off , education was n't a very important thing during communism because a lot of communists came from the lower class . 
  intellectuals in political and public positions were mostly purged by the communists . 
  since communism in romania was a one party , one man sort of thing , political education was out of the question . 
  that has many effects today and can be especially observed when mostly older people ( not that all younger people understand politics or anything ) expect the president or the pm to do everything or be responsible for everything , or they just do n't understand how politics work in democracy work period . 
  in communism , they knew ceausescu was , as some say , `` mother and father '' , but in democracy different institutions have different roles . 
  then there 's the economical education which is also pretty bad . 
  i think we rank the worst in the eu so a lot of older and younger people do n't understand how economics work . 
  so you get what we have today when the current government proposes raising salaries and pensions and cutting taxes at a level that our economy ca n't sustain , but somehow they have the popular support among those people who vote ( which are n't many unfortunately ) . 
  then when the opposition cuts salaries and pensions to relief the economy , they get the finger . 
  then there 's the corruption and nepotism . 
  it was not only the political class that was extremely corrupt or practiced nepotism , it was ingrained in the culture during communism . 
  so today you find some people saying , `` so what they stole a little bit of money ? 
  at least they did something for us too . '' . 
  this is just in relation to politics because when it comes to corruption and nepotism , many citizens still practice it today . 
  for example , being a director of a hospital based on merit and not because you have relations is still a discussion topic here . 
  so yeah , ugly buildings are part of it , but truth is communism left a much deeper mark than a couple of ugly buildings . 
  - some do n't understand what communism did to eastern europe . 
  - some do not understand the legacy the communists left behind . 
  - some underestimate or they 're really naive @ the russian leaders . 
  - some think we 're weak , but we 've gone through some really though shit and we 're still up and running . 
  oh , you too dear big sister france . 
  after all , our flag was inspired from yours . 
  i like the colors in the flag of the netherlands and luxembourg . 
  germany , serbia , sweden , denmark , iceland and norway also have pretty flags . 
  and the eu flag of course . 
  those movements need better pr as well . 
  nothing happened over here and i knew of it . 
  i do n't think it 's common at all . 
  movies , shows , etc. 
  that are in english or any other language than romanian are subbed in romanian . 
  only cartoons are dubbed in romanian . 
  there are some channels that are exclusively in other languages ( german , hungarian ) with no subtitles . 
  i 'm from bucharest so i do n't know about local tv channels though . 
  romance speakers unite . 
   if not , romance languages union ftw . 
  i do n't see `` minus romania '' anywhere so that 's it you 're all stuck with us now < 3, 
  europa for both . 
  no distinction without context . 
  yes . 
  some examples from bucharest : - charles de gaulle square - spanish square where there 's a cervantes statue . 
  that 's all that comes in mind right now . 
  - [ ion antonescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_antonescu ) - some nationalists/extremists consider him a hero . 
  - [ nicolae ceau\u015fescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolae_ceau%c8%99escu ) - some old people say it was better during his time . 
  moldova needs to stop flirting with the russians before they get ukrained . 
  our parties are less about ideology and more about opportunism , but i 'll try . 
  these are just parties in the parliament . 
  - [ psd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_ ( romania ) ) | social democrats | left | [ liviu dragnea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liviu_dragnea ) biggest party here . 
  most corrupt too . 
  they 've won the recent elections and made a coalition with alde so they hold both the parliament and the government . 
  irresponsible and populist economic measures such as raising salaries/pensions and cutting taxes to an extent that will not jusr put us above the 3 % deficit limit , it might completely fuck whatever 's left of our economy . 
  conservative in social issues . 
  - [ pnl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_liberal_party_ ( romania ) ) | national liberals | center left | [ raluca turcan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raluca_turcan ) ( interim ) liberal conservatives . 
  pretty opportunistic with votes when they can to try to gain some votes against psd . 
  people say they cater to the richer demographic and to corporate interests . 
  have some corruption problems , but there 's still hope for them . 
  they support the anti corruption fight even if sometimes they do it through gritted teeth as some of their party members are being arrested . 
  - [ usr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/save_romania_union ) | save romania union | center | [ nicu\u015for dan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicu%c8%99or_dan ) new party with no defined ideology . 
  they have some people who lean right and some people who lean left . 
  they based their campaign on the anti corruption fight and they had appeal for the younger people in urban areas . 
  9 % of votes in their first parliamentary election . 
  the rest are pretty meh . 
  alde is schizophrenic with their new anti eu speech and udmr is the party for hungarian minorities . 
  both are in coalition with psd in the parliament . 
  then there 's pmp that 's a opportunistic party which has appeal for moldovans because they support the union between our countries . 
  first two are parties which usually enter coalitions with the winner . 
  pmp looks to be heading down that road too . 
  emperor iohannis , leader of the roman ~ ~ ian ~ ~ empire . 
  or , since he has german ethnicity , herr iohannis . 
  ah , one more thing to establish that romania and france are related . 
  there 's a messiah cult going on here too . 
  it 's mostly because of communism here , when one man held all power and did everything . 
  bucharest and transylvania . 
  well , i think it 's the attitude of the politicians which rubs off on the people , it 's in the media , in the movies ... it 's everywhere . 
  i do n't mean to say the us does n't have a lot of power or that it is n't doing better than a lot of countries , but this sort of attitude is n't just a turn off , it 's actively hurting the way your politics work , your foreign policy , your way of thinking on issues . 
  i think it 's the whole '' ( n ) america 's the greatest country in the world ! '',
