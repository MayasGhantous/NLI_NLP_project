  `` home of the brave , land of the free '' sort of thing . 
  it 's what americans are taught to believe and what shapes their actions as both individuals and as a country . 
  how does italy have such a good score though ? 
  not that common [ in romania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/isxumkw.jpg ) . 
  hungary rival to austria ? 
  they 'd probably be cheering for austria rather than for hungary man . 
  / s :p, 
  football : hungary . 
  man ... you should see what the hooligans on both sides get up to . 
  this is some intense shit . 
  [ city buses ] ( http://www.transport-in-comun.ro/bucuresti/autobuze/citaro/4450/4498-331-2010-09-04-001.jpg ) - nope , the drivers have their own `` cabin '' and it 's a bit more complicated . 
  it 's not something we do . 
  we say thank you to taxi drivers and to [ maxi taxi ] ( http://www.ziaruldepenet.ro/wp-content/uploads/maxitaxi.png ) drivers . 
  i thought monarch refers strictly to kings and queens . 
  [ carol i of the hohenzollern-sigmaringen house ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/carol_i_king_of_romania.jpg ) was our first monarch . 
  his wife was [ queen elisabeth ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/queen_elizabeth_of_romania.jpg ) . 
  together they had [ princess maria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/queen_elisabeth_of_romania_with_her_daughter.jpg ) who died at the age of 4 because of scarlet fever . 
  because carol i had no other child to put on the throne , his nephew , [ ferdinand i ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/king_ferdinand_of_romania.jpg/426px-king_ferdinand_of_romania.jpg ) , became king after him . 
  his wife was queen [ maria of romania ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/20/1b/32/201b322d25f06dafd8bcf68f08e22796.jpg ) . 
  they had a few children : [ carol ii ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jsbh0u7th50/t3rds_p-dvi/aaaaaaaaiks/872-5jfrktq/s1600/00d9645ffed8e3097d49a2a8f5ebc9c5.jpg ) , [ elisabeth ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/elisabeta_a_romaniei.jpg/800px-elisabeta_a_romaniei.jpg ) , [ maria ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i6yzj6o.jpg ) ( such a beautiful child ) , [ nicholas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/1903nicholas-09.jpg ) , [ ileana ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/printesa_ileana_de_romania.jpg ) and [ mircea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/prince_mircea_of_romania.jpg ) . 
  carol ii , being the oldest , should have been king after ferdinand i , but his affair with a commoner obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country . 
  he was married to [ elena ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/queen_helen_of_romania.jpg ) , who is called the queen mother of romania . 
  they had a son , [ mihai i ] ( https://gen90.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/180512_187017017987089_5753912_n.jpg ) , who 's first reign started in 20 july 1927 when he was just [ 5 years old ] ( http://www.europafm.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/regele-mihai-3.jpg ) and ended on 8 june 1930 , when after a coup d'etat , carol ii was allowed to return and claim the throne . 
  later he was exiled again and his son 's second reign began on 6 september 1940 . 
  mihai i married [ queen ana ] ( http://media.tvrnews.ro/image/201509/w300/hqdefault_09827300.jpg ) and they had a couple of children . 
  he was the last monarch of romania and is the last surviving monarch or other head of state from the interwar period . 
  he 's also among the few surviving head of states from wwii . 
  [ quite a looker . 
  europe ( including russia who would be just very happy to join in ) has more nukes than us . 
  our corruption . 
  it is incredible how some of our politicians behave , especially social democrats . 
  that level of nastiness ... rare . 
  how much i pay : around 5 euros advertised speed : 100 mbps actual speed : 100 mbps you can also pay around 9 euros for 1gb speed . 
  europe besides romania and the balkans : incest is the best put your cousin to the test !, 
  most of them have darker skin than romanians and yeah some of them have blond hair or even blue eyes , but they 're a minority . 
  i do n't know any non gypsy romanian that speaks romani . 
  romanians ca n't understand their language either . 
  that 's not to say they do n't speak romanian , but if they speak romani the vast majority will not understand a thing . 
  glad some spanish people can tell us apart though . 
  yes . 
  especially among the `` hipsters '' . 
  we got two dads cause we 're progressive like that . 
  :p traian and decebal . 
  a lot of older people vote sdp . 
  not all of them , but a lot . 
  sdp kinda always wins one or another . 
  and they 're very corrupt , but also populist , promising higher salaries and pensions even when it 's not economically smart . 
  younger people who vote more liberal parties blame these older people for not thinking about the country 's future and voting these corrupt . 
  older people say younger people do n't know anything . 
  i do n't understand what you 're getting at . 
  i do n't know denmark 's laws , but logically , if that person with `` a medical problem '' does not have insurance from their original country or does n't work legally in denmark for a medical insurance , they will have to pay out of their pocket to solve their medical problem . 
  when a person starts working legally in your country , he is entitled to medical treatment because he pays taxes . 
  do i have to explain such basic things to you ? 
  read again . 
  yes . 
  mostly political . 
  but some tend to ignore that there are young people voting sdp too . 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2011/world/europe/01/06/romania.witch.tax/ enough said . 
  lol nah , they 're not that popular and most people know they 're scammers but there 's quite a few people that believe in them . 
  i 'd switch hungary with a country that does n't hate us . 
  might be hard to find one though .

  why are companies allowed to pay them less ? 
  why are they allowed to hire them illegally in the first place ? 
  they could just as well report them . 
   flooding stop reading these articles , there 's no flood . 
  and people should stop debating if people that are a certain nationality should have full equal treatment , especially in the eu . 
  it sounds xenophobic as hell to doubt that . 
  we 're people !, 
  sure , if someone is in the country illegally or working illegally , that should be solved by the authorities , but most of them go to another country and work legally and pay taxes like everyone else . 
  my opinion of him is worse now . 
  i thought maybe he 'd settle down once he 'll be in the office but he 's only going downhill . 
  he 's racist , sexist , immature , incompetent , he hates the eu and gives blowjobs to putin . 
  so yeah ... definitely a big no . 
  usually i do n't mind , especially if it 's done in a polite way as you mentioned , but if you 're doing it in a rude way then i 'll make a point of reminding you that i 'm making an effort to speak to you in * your * language and that you would n't be perfect in my language either . 
  i do n't support hillary at all , the only candidate that seemed okay to me was bernie ( although his comment about romanian internet was stupid ) , but that does n't mean we should not attack trump . 
  during his campaign he said things like , `` i 'm not taking bombing the europe off the table '' and recently he sent an ambassador for the eu that said he helped bring the soviet union so maybe the european union should be tamed too . 
  hillary or not , there are legit reasons to attack trump . 
  that guy should not have even been a candidate period . 
  what self respecting western country , that should know better , puts that kind of man in charge ? 
  there 's a lot to be said about his diplomacy , but the root problem is that trump is not a mature person . 
  he 's just not . 
  if he continues like this , he 'll be remembered as putin 2.0 in history , but dumber . 
  well , i think that playing nice for trump 's sake is n't a good idea either . 
  we 're not his child friends . 
  he 's shady as hell with russia and does a lot of incredibly dumb things , like wishing the eu will be destroyed . 
  maybe some eu posturing would show him that we may be nicer , but we ai n't his play toys , especially since he 's not a friend of the eu at all . 
  if the us elects him again i 'm going to have trouble looking at americans with respect . 
   right now i 'm just waiting for the tweets ... yeah . 
  that 's gon na be fun . 
  i think it 's great if the eu is being genuine about this , but a bit hypocritical . 
  while the european parliament supported our entry in the sa few years ago , the netherlands , finland and germany still oppose it .
