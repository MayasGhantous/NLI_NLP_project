  besides , romania has had good relations with the us for a long time now and we should be treated as partners not pets . 
  ah , the privilege of being in schengen . 
  i do n't really remember . 
  i think i saw it as a means to an end so i can understand cartoons . 
  it was fun later on . 
  18 , but minors can get away with drinking alcohol sometimes . 
  it all depends on how much a bar enforces the rule of checking id and how old the minor looks . 
  i think it would be okay for a 16 or 17 year old to drink a glass of beer or wine from time to time . 
  it 's all about not going crazy . 
  i think it 's like another user suggested : teach young people how to treat alcohol . 
  the sdp is the gift that keeps on giving . 
  like an std . 
  - law project similar to emergency ordinance 13 is in parliament for debate . 
  term ends tomorrow i think . 
  - dna ( anti corruption agency ) found out that the ministry of relations with the parliament initially gave a negative opinion on emergency ordinance 13 , but in two hours the negative notice was destroyed and replaced with a favorable one . 
  - constitutional court says there 's a judicial conflict between dna and the executive which is . . not true . 
  and loads more . 
  you do n't need to watch house of cards , you just need to watch romanian politics . 
  there are 14 national parks here . 
  some of the most known are : - [ retezat national park ] ( http://blog.hotelguru.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/parcul-national-retezat.jpg ) - [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retezat_national_park ) - [ bucegi national park ] ( http://www.stopco2.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/parcul-natural-bucegi.jpg ) - it has the romanian [ sphinx ] ( http://www.ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/adrian-petrisor-11-sfinx-bucegi.jpg ) . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucegi_natural_park ) - [ apuseni national park ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/pietrele_albe.jpg/1024px-pietrele_albe.jpg ) - [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apuseni_natural_park ) [ here 's the complete list . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protected_areas_of_romania ), 
  actually it 's the opposite . 
  it 's basically showing how communism destroyed our country and how we do n't have much left and we are n't progressing as fast as we 'd like to so people are leaving the country because they see no hope and no point in staying . 
  the little girls are eating bananas . 
  fruits like bananas , oranges , etc. 
  were rare in communist romania . 
  a lot of kids could only eat these fruits at christmas . 
  then you see him standing next to a directions post with `` france , italy , spain '' . 
  people are leaving because although we do n't live in communism anymore , the country is n't doing that well . 
  corrupt politicians , low wages , etc. 
  they 're leaving for a better life . 
  then you see a gymnast . 
  we used to be really good at gymnastics and sports during communism , but now ... not as much . 
  i mean we still have some talented people , but it 's different . 
  our politicians could care less about sports and promoting sports . 
  and of course it sucks . 
  but the song is n't saying that communism was good because we had that back then . 
  i think it 's more about wishing we could appreciate and encourage talent more . 
  the song is also based off of this 70s song that was named `` we in the year 2000 '' where the writer of the song basically wrote down what he wished to see happening by 2000 . 
  20 years later , in 1990 , he said none of his wishes for a better life came true . 
  granted , we were just one year out of communism . 
  at some point during the video you can see a `` we in the year 3000 '' sign . 
  as in , maybe we did n't make it all better in 2000 so we 'll try to get some things done by 3000 . 
  the message is basically `` a lot of time passed since communism and we still are n't doing very well . 
  people are leaving the country and they 'll still leave until things get better . 
  we hoped and hoped and here we are still hoping for a better future . '', 
  here are the whole lyrics :  we know that a long time passed  and a lot of time will pass , too , i feel that . 
   in 10 years i 'll still catch  some who lie , some some who want to leave  but let it go  the romanian is made to drown  his sorrow with cold blood  when he stumbles upon trouble  he parties with a cold beer  he 's outdoing  tell me why you 're stealing  how much more do you want to steal ? 
   do n't you see that we 're many mouths ( to feed )  and we all know what it means to endure  but how many falls do you endure ? 
   how much you rejoice and how much do you curse ? 
   how many things do you long for ? 
   and you are sure that you do n't have enough !, 
  here comes chorus and then :  my parents are sure , like yours  that they have n't raised me with bruises  the taught me not to take other paths  they explained to me that the world is bad  that life is hard and i have to do something somehow  they told me one day they 'll be gone  and i have to agitate , i have to fight  because time passes in one shot  it carries us all over the place  it changes me by luck  it runs after me just for a vote  the world feels it , wants facts , no words  a simple man to be president !, 
  i do n't really listen to rap , but here 's one : [ locul potrivit ( the right place ) by guess who ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5jbfylii4g ) - i thought i 'd share it because it 's basically a song about the weight of the communist legacy . 
  you can see it starts with little kids singing a song from the 70s ( communist romania ) before the actual song starts . 
  i 'm not very good at translating stuff , but the chorus goes like this :  but it 's nothing  i 've been consoled since i was little  know what i 'm saying yo  we were n't born in the right place  no , no , we were n't born in the right place  we did n't receive anything , we made everything from nothing, 
  i live in the capital so ... quite common . 
  world domination . 
  google and chrome . 
  used to use opera before , but not anymore . 
  he said stuff like : `` the country can only be ruled with a machine gun . '', 
  he was a very , very temperamental person . 
  he often insulted people if they did n't agree with him . 
  he hated hungarians who are a minority here . 
  he hated roma people and gay people . 
  he was also a romanian holocaust denier . 
  - carrefour - cora - auchan - megaimage - lidl - kaufland probably forgot some . 
  in kindergarten . 
  nope . 
  - cartoon network was in english when it first aired in our country . 
  - english classes from kindergarten to university . 
  ah , yes , i knew this one , thanks . 
  did n't we meet on another thread and decided to agree to disagree ? 
  we have a statue of athena here in bucharest too , but you 're right , there 's a great deal of roman or greek statues all around europe at least . 
  that 's great . 
  and the statue 's concept is awesome . 
  thanks !, 
  i had no idea there were so many . 
  thanks !, 
  actually , the fact that communists were so against religion is a strong factor as to why post communist countries became quite religious . 
  north of the wall !, 
   this is more a us / uk thing as far as i know . 
  well , we have social democrats and they 're just a bunch of old corrupt commies . 
  i do n't even think the european sdp likes them . 
  i do n't think all of them think that , but some do . 
  and that says a lot about their character . 
  what ? 
  that 's not even how it works here . 
  we have two right wing parties : 1 . 
  center right - national liberals 2 . 
  far right - pru which do n't even have any seats in the parliament because they got like 3 % of the votes or smth . 
  party in power : social democrats . 
  up until the guns this sounds perfectly french . 
  you 're supposed to light the apocalypse on fire though . 
  depends on what kind of apocalypse . 
  what 's hunting us ? 
  zombie or an illness ? 
  cause if you do n't give me a threat i ca n't know how i 'd react . 
  i 'd probably like to stay in a group with my family and others , but people tend to get pretty fucked up during apocalyptic events .
