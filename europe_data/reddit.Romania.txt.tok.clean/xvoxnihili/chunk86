  i would also hope our government would make a plan , but then again . . they are our government so we 're fucked anyway . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/ztwgwehiwm0?t=13 ) is our national anthem by the way . 
  [ we used to have one ] ( http://static.inliniedreapta.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/corneliu-vadim-tudor-1.jpg ) , but now he 's dead . 
  he was so crazy that people preferred to vote for a neo communist against him . 
  he was a nationalist and generally extremist . 
  american media , is that you ? 
  i also find it a bit rude when people put an accent on that `` eastern european '' look . 
  but then again you have to agree that a lot of people here love the 100 % white , blonde with blue eyes look . 
  swedish people are considered to be the prettiest because of that . 
  kinda of off putting . 
  yes . 
  it 's not that uncommon . 
  i do n't have air con so it 's basically hell . 
  digi24 in my opinion . 
  they 're not the most trusted in the country because the most trusted one is a sdp propaganda channel ( antena3 ) , but digi24 is the most trusted by the educated youth . 
  yes , thank you . 
   do they still feel resentment towards former enemies ? 
  they are not fond of the russians at all . 
  at least the ones i know . 
   do they think things are going in the right direction ? 
  not really . 
  they think that as long as there 's putin or people like putin leading russia , tensions will only grow . 
  yeah , i get that it was intended to be like that . 
  and i do give him credit for managing it , the entitlement displayed by him annoyed me loads . 
  i liked it and i like most of tarantino 's movies . 
  i think christoph waltz played his role very well . 
  daniel br\u00fchl 's role was quite annoying though . 
  lol as another user mentioned , the fingers scene was interesting . 
  thank you for the recommendation !, 
  i will check it out . 
  let 's go to the winchester , have a pint , and wait for this to blow over . 
  most recent , but not a movie : i 've seen some episodes from the norwegian tv show skam . 
  other than that i 've seen these ( some have some english in them too , but not all ) : - la rafle ( 2010 ) - french - lore ( 2012 ) - german - sorstalans\u00e1g ( 2005 ) - hungarian - der untergang ( 2004 ) - german - napola - elite f\u00fcr den f\u00fchrer ( 2004 ) - german - sophie scholl - die letzten tage ( 2005 ) - german - max manus ( 2008 ) - norwegian , german , russian , finnish - nackt unter w\u00f6lfen ( 2015 ) - german , polish , french - the pianist ( 2002 ) - german , russian - auschwitzin vangit ( 2008 ) - french , polish , hebrew - die f\u00e4lscher ( 2007 ) - russian , hebrew - un amour \u00e0 taire ( 2005 ) - french - zwartboek ( 2006 ) - dutch , german , hebrew - in darkness ( 2011 ) - polish , ukrainian , yiddish , german - la vita \u00e8 bella ( 1997 ) - italian , german - into the white ( 2012 ) - norwegian , german and some more , but these are all i recall atm . 
  i just wanted to be a good european and try to learn the anthem . 
  haha . 
  and then i found the latin version and well , that was way easier . 
  i tried to match the sounds and while i ca n't spell all words exactly like i should , i think i got the majority of them right . 
  i also learned that `` w '' is generally `` v '' in german while there 's a difference between `` w '' and `` v '' in english . 
  your language also has that `` h '' sound to it that people should pay attention to . 
  while we use the `` h '' , the french have trouble with it . 
  everything that costs 20 $ here is probably way more expensive in any western country , but our salaries are way smaller . 
  well , it 's not much of a difference with us . 
  i learned to pronounce it just as i learned to sing the first two lyrics of the german anthem . 
  or the european anthem with german lyrics . 
  i paid attention and basically wrote down the way it 's pronounced . 
  indoor smoking ( except homes ) was banned here last year . 
  the people who smoke have grown to accept it , but it 's very unpleasant for us during winter because it 's very cold . 
  bucure\u015ftean , muntean , rom\u00e2n , european from bucharest , from [ muntenia ( southeast ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muntenia ) , romanian , european, 
  i mean we have [ these two assholes ] ( http://image.stirileprotv.ro/media/images/600x375/dec2016/61854953.jpg ) and their stupid parties , but they 're not exactly like trump . 
  highschool : - around 6 classes every day , sometimes 7 . 
  - class lasts for 50 minutes . 
  - 5 minute break during winter , 10 minute break during spring and autumn . 
  - we never had a bigger break than a 10 minute break so you have to eat and do everything else in 10 minutes tops . 
  found the alcoholic . 
  it 's way more understandable to put ice in a glass of whiskey than it is to put ice in a glass of wine . 
  why in the world would anyone put ice in wine ? 
  in strong liquors , i get it , but wine ? 
  that 's great !, 
  and no problem . 
  have fun on your trip !, 
  those are some of our nicest cities . 
  there 's also bucharest , but it 's your typical capital city : some nice architecture , commie blocks , nightlife in the old town , etc. 
  i actually met a couple of people from rep. moldova . 
  we had two classmates in highschool who were from rep. moldova . 
  the girl was alright , i could understand her easily , but the guy spoke in such a way that it was sometimes a bit hard to understand what he meant . 
  some of our meaner classmates taught him a bad word that he did not know until then , but told him it meant something else and that he should ask our class master about it . 
  i forgot the word , but we all had a laugh , including him , and our class master told the others to stop corrupting the innocent boy . 
  they were n't bullying him or anything and he actually got along with us mostly . 
  both of them also knew bulgarian and russian . 
  i remember i actually fought the religion teacher on his behalf . 
  ugh , religion . 
  the second time i met some moldovan people was when they came to protest in bucharest . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  it 's all romanian clay in the end . 
  if you mean far-right , we currently only have one ( united romania party ) that could n't get any seats in the parliament because they had below 5 % ( 3,5 % ) of the votes at the parliamentary elections in december 2016 . 
  they oppose refugee quotas and are against gay people , the euro and ttip . 
  it ca n't be that bad . 
  and like gringo i suppose ? 
  used to happen during communism . 
  you do n't know the country where us put a anti missile shield ? 
  shame  ) ), 
  same here , but just one `` l '' . 
  * we also use `` da ? '', 
  as in `` yes ? '' . 
  every latin country : * shame !, 
  shame !, 
  hi , how are you ? 
  note : some people use `` salut '' or `` ciao '' for `` hi '' . 
  `` ciao '' can also be used for goodbye . 
  good morning/day/evening , how are you ? 
  sometimes i get lost in thought and stare at people unintentionally . 
  sometimes i do it intentionally if i see something interesting , but it 's more of a glance than actual staring . 
  i might be german . 
  former soviet states does n't work if you include romania because we are n't former soviet just former communist . 
  but yeah , op , you could also talk about the difference in development speed between certain ex communist countries and how being closer to the west influenced that . 
  no , not really , but i kind of shocked / r/europe when i said the alde leader has made anti eu comments . 
  context is important though . 
  yeah - wait what ? 
  most capitals and major cities will be more liberal than the country side . 
  russia stirs shit in the baltics , poland and romania .
