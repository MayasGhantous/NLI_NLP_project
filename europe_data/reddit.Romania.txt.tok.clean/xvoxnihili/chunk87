  ukraine is mostly dead . 
  all these countries invoke article 5 . 
  there would also be a massive resistance movements throughout europe . 
  we would eventually beat russia down , but lots of people die . 
  i 'd probably try to help a resistance movement as much as i can . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd have the means to flee . 
  many people would n't have the means to flee the country . 
  can trump invade austria without invading another eu country first ? 
  i have to agree although i do n't have any statistics to base it on . 
  what 's happening in a country during war is without a doubt terrible , especially when people you know start dying , but at the same time , adrenaline and the will to stop this overcomes the depression momentarily . 
  when the war stops ... well , that 's another story . 
  just joking about the `` dope '' reference . 
  no , it would n't . 
  not everyone has netherlands ' drug laws  ) ) ), 
  miners ? 
  not that many left . 
  and we do n't exactly have a [ good history with miners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_1990_mineriad ) . 
  it 's alright : humor , quality debate , etc. 
  some people complain it 's a bit too political , but most things are tied to politics so yeah ... 
  yep . 
  quite a few turkish or arab owned little stores in my area . 
  but they 're not turkish/arabic themed stores , they 're just owned by people of this nationality . 
  actually yes . 
  one and five cent coins . 
  but they were n't cents , they were `` bani '' ( our coins ) so there were more of them than there would be cents . 
  lol, 
  it took place in 2016 . 
  i know spain did the same in their civil war and they did n't get it back either . 
  our government had a campaign to buy a privately owned sculpture by the famous romanian sculptor constantin br\u00e2ncu\u0219i entitled `` the wisdom of the earth '' . 
  everyone was invited to donate money as the government could n't buy it with just their funds . 
  it was supposed to be half the money from the government and half from the citizens through donations . 
  russian embassy donated 100eur which romania saw as a insult considering that : a ) they 're an embassy , they can do better than that . 
  b ) they sent a video full of historical revisionism along with the donation . 
  the message of the video was to basically `` learn our true history '' which implied that the soviet union was a good friend to us . 
  funnily enough , not even our communist dictator liked the soviet union . 
  c ) our treasury was sent to russia in wwi for safekeeping . 
  they 've never returned it to us . 
  we 're talking 120 tones of gold plus valuable objects . 
  so people felt insulted and they got angry . 
  rightfully so . 
  some protested at the embassy and they decided that we do n't need russia 's 100eur and purposely went out and raised 100eur in coins and returned it to the embassy . 
  our minister of foreign affairs also reacted saying that while we appreciate and encourage donations , the video that came with their donation presents a subjective view of certain periods in history . 
  [ ilie nastase ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/4tvlew/ilie_n%c4%83stase_mia%c5%9f_dori_un_referendum_%c3%aen_care_noi/?ref=search_posts ), 
  no fucks given . 
   once or twice a century / s  romania is not as strong or as important  france :p funny you should say we 're not important when :  the number of romanian troops sent to fight in the soviet union exceeded that of all of germany 's other allies combined . 
   romania had been a major power in the oil industry since the 1800s . 
  it was one of the largest producers in europe and ploesti was a major part of that production . 
  the ploie\u0219ti oil refineries provided about 30 % of all axis oil production . 
  and without our oil the german war machine would have suffered which is why the us later bombed our oil refineries . 
  of course our army is n't what it used to be because times have changed . 
  or they have n't . 
  both work . 
  another interesting thing is that unlike many european countries , we could be completely independent of russian gas . 
  makes it harder to blackmail us . 
  i think that without nuclear power russia would n't be as impressive as it is considered to be . 
  - russia threatens us because we have the anti missile shield and nato troops on our territory . 
  - we 're also doing some exercises in the black sea . 
  - russia 's general attitude is `` how dare you not be defenseless ? '' . 
  - incredibly dumb and impulsive officials who say outrageous things just to make putin look a little more sane although putin himself threatened us with nuclear war . 
  - although we fought side by side in our independence war , we 're sort of historical enemies due to su deeds . 
  - do n't forget that time when they tried to donate 100 euros to us and sent us a video with the message `` learn the true history '' . 
  people went out , gathered 100 euro in coins and gave them back to the embassy . 
  that was somehow both insulting and hilarious . 
  so , op , yeah , i agree with your sentiment that normalizing this is not okay and that it would be a scandal if they were to threaten western countries , but russia is still upset about losing its cold war influence . 
  i 'm answering your quiz , but this question :  do you believe he would/will attack the baltic states ? 
  * has a complicated answer . 
  and you should have probably added a `` do n't know '' or just `` unsure '' option . 
  my opinion is complicated , but i find it hard choosing an answer that represents what i think . 
  my most honest answer to that and the shortest one would be `` it depends '' . 
  let 's agree to disagree then . 
  you should bring me one on 1st march . 
   can it happen ? 
  does it have any support among the public ? 
  it made the news but everyone was meh . 
  so no , it probably wo n't happen , it was just a public person offended by its slavic character . 
  i see . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
   50 % source for that ? 
  i do n't recall that number and i 'm genuinely curious . 
  does n't `` si '' derive from the latin `` sic '' ? 
  it may not be exactly `` yes '' , but that 's pretty much what it means . 
  - the dacians were romanized by the romans and became romanians . 
  - although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the lands now forming romania , a sedentary romance-speaking population survived , many of them by seeking refuge in the carpathian mountains . 
  these lands remained the main `` center of romanization '' after the slavs began to assimilate the latin-speaking population of the balkans in the 6th century . 
  - our vocabulary has 15 % slavic words because of being surrounded by slavs . 
  - language reform in 19th century . 
  my opinion is that romania has done fairly well in keeping our romance language . 
  i love it . 
  but then this happens : italy : si france : oui spanish : si portuguese : sim romania : * da !, 
  * \u0ca0_\u0ca0 actually a romanian public figure has suggested last year that we change our word for `` yes '' because we 're not a slavic people and we should not use a slavic word for `` yes '' . 
  haha . 
  it 's good you got anything at all . 
  i remember i was excited cn was going to be introduced in romania , but then everything was in english with no subs or dub so i was like `` what ? '' . 
  i learned english from it with my mom 's help so i guess it checks out . 
  not french . 
  latin . 
  is this why we 're last in the european obesidity index ? 
  cause we 've never had free refills ? 
  i want free refills . 
  first constitution was in 1864 though .
