   this is the story of our ardeal  and of our brave people  the whole history with battles and sacrifices  lives in today 's union . 
   justice and peace watch over the carpathians  and there are leaves and flowers all across the country  the victory is ours , they are our brothers ,  long live the three colours !, 
   we want peace for our country and world peace ,  and if they cast a curse on us  the carpathians and its brothers will come together  following the supreme commandant . 
  sure , that sounds interesting . 
  thank you . 
  learned about it pretty recently . 
  i heard it 's used alongside the map of greater hungary . 
  i 'm going to answer for my country . 
  worst : ion iliescu best : klaus iohannis this is mainly more modern . 
  i am in a way ... and i think my fear is valid . 
  as a eastern european , and an old foe of russia , i am not afraid of the country per se , but of this country mad leadership and how its propaganda could turn people into war machines in no time . 
  knowing our history with them , you could say that fearing them is reasonable . 
  at the same time , i want to be confident in nato . 
  problem is that trump is n't just messing things in the us , but also acting unfriendly towards the eu . 
  so if he comes , whether he comes to my country or another eu country , i 'd still be annoyed . 
  i do n't know if he comes as a friend or a foe . 
  and this confusion makes us look very bad . 
  yeah . 
  that is the awful truth . 
  well , that 's what ignorance is . 
  did they bother to ask us ? 
  do they think we ca n't stand our own ground ? 
  i do n't need anyone in the us to tell me about my country or about the eu . 
  and i 'm sure others feel the same . 
  they can criticize eu foreign policies , if they have anything to criticize us over , but they , including trump , should mind their own business when it comes to eu internal affairs . 
  do they see eu asking `` when will texas break away ? 
  when will california break away ? 
  i do n't like it one bit , but trump seems to see as a competitor instead of an ally . 
  he already wishes the eu to fail . 
  i think he 's made it clear that he 's no friend to us . 
  i took that test some time ago and it game me a somewhat similar result to yours . 
  i 'm generally more liberal than anything else . 
   would you support doing the same thing in your country ? 
  what the hell ? 
  absolutely not . 
  we may not have taken in a lot of refugees , but we do have a muslim community of our own , created way back in history . 
  that would mean that any muslim living here that leaves the country for any reason can not return . 
  and that 's absolutely insane . 
  there should be no ban at all . 
  it is not effective . 
  like i said before , i can not even call it a simplistic solution to a complicated problem because it is n't . 
  this is n't how you stop terrorism at all . 
  there is one more thing though . 
  they 're not just republic of macedonia , they 're `` former yugoslav '' rom . 
  i think that 's an o bit obsolete , but i do see your point too . 
  i did n't even know this , but yep , it seems so . 
   moravian wallachia ( czech : valassko ) is a mountainous region in the south-east corner of moravia about the size of luxembourg . 
  the region is called wallachia and the people are called wallachians ( valasi ) . 
  it was settled over many centuries by migrating romanian shepherds called ` vlachs ' , herding their sheep westwards along the mighty carpathian mountain range . 
  moravian wallachia , an ethnographic region demarcated in particular by the moravian-silesian beskydy mountains and the vset\u00edn hills , was colonized in the 13th and the 14th centuries by wallachians , shepherds coming from romania . 
  their culture blended with the lifestyles and customs of the original population of the local valleys . 
  why do n't they just change their official name ? 
  how can greece stop them ? 
  i know that 's their official name , but have never heard someone in my country refer to them as anything other than macedonia . 
  or , in rare cases , republic of macedonia . 
  but maybe that 's just me . 
  what 's this about ? 
  can you give me a quick explication ? 
  [ the 1977 earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_vrancea_earthquake ) . 
  there was another that took places in the 40s that was even bigger than this one , but the 77 one had more casualties . 
  vrancea is pretty known for seismic activity . 
  you missed the slav `` yes '' . 
  can you guess our national shame ? 
  like all our teachers would say , `` francophone friendship !, 
  ! ~ '' even though officially we are not a francophone country , many french teachers here are like no romania francophone country . 
  no more english . 
  french !, 
  it 's funny , but most of my french teachers were really passionate about french , even if not all of them knew how to properly teach it . 
  it 's one of the many songs we had to learn in our french classes in school . 
  i mean it was nice the first time , but even now it rings in my head . 
  we learned all sorts of french songs . 
  i wo n't count english . 
  also , yes , i was bored . 
  je m ` appelle / u/xvoxnihili . 
  enchant\u00e9 !, 
  - but let 's not forget the annoying song of savez-vous planter les choux , \u00e0 la mode , \u00e0 la mode ? 
  there 's quite some more but that 's enough french . 
  ** german ** - ~ ~ ( du bist ) ~ ~ schei\u00dfe ( i knew the word , but copied the way it 's written ) - ich liebe dich - some rammstein songs - eu + german anthem ** spanish ** - i learned some spanish from my grandma 's telenovelas . 
  my sister also knows spanish . 
  but they 're really random words and phrases like `` estoy embarazada '' ( everyone keeps getting pregnant man ) or `` me duele la cabeza '' . 
  i also know to say holla , yo soy / u/xvoxnihili . 
  and bad words like est\u00fapido or hijo de puta . 
  i know puta is similar to putain in french . 
  i know more ( not swear words :') ) , but i no use in writing too much . 
  ** italian ** - i know some words and phrases in italian too . 
  like `` ciao . 
  or `` ausilio '' which is great in case i get caught by italian mafia of course . 
  i also know something bad like `` mache cazzo porcheria '' ( what the hell is this ? ) . 
  not sure how correct is that , but i know i heard it somewhere . 
  i know more ( not swear words :') ) , but i no use in writing too much . 
  ** bulgarian ** - i know how to count to ten in bulgarian and present myself , but i can only write latin , i ca n't do cyrillic . 
  is `` what 's your name ? '', 
  and you respond `` az se kazvam / u/xvoxnihili . '', 
  - edno , dva , tri , cetiri , pet , shest , sedem , osem , devet , deset ** hungarian ** - literally just `` igen '' , `` nem , nem , soha '' , `` k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs '' and yes i had to copy how k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is written . 
  i also know some words in russian and polish . 
  and greek !, 
  my sister was obsessed with greece at some point . 
  in 2000 , people had to choose between the neocommunist [ ion iliescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_iliescu ) ( now accused of crimes against humanity ) or a crazy far right politician named [ vadim tudor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_vadim_tudor ) ( now dead ) . 
  - dick is used a lot . 
  ( literally : go in my dick !,
