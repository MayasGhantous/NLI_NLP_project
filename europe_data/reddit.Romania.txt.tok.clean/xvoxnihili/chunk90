  ( literally : suck my dick !, 
  ( literally : in my dick ! ), 
  there was actually a comedian saying that we use `` pula mea '' instead of punctuation , but also as an answer to a lot of questions . 
  `` ce faci ? / how are you ? '', 
  my dick . '', 
  it 's usually said with a \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af tone . 
  lol - hell . 
  ( go to hell ! ), 
  - your mom 's dead relatives . 
  ( fuck your mother 's dead relatives ! ), 
  which is another way to say `` suck my dick !, 
  '' , usually accompanied by the fuck you sign . 
  which means `` fuck you ! '', 
  - idiot ( idiot ) , prost ( stupid ) , retardat ( retard ) and more . 
  means `` fuck your mother 's onion ! '', 
  do n't be fooled by the short list . 
  we have so many ways to curse , it 's hilarious . 
  we 'll be the 4th this year . 
  but i wonder if it 's still worth the effort considering trump . 
   problem is in paris everyone is always in a hurry . 
   i know what you mean . 
  most capitals feel like that . 
  french people are intimidating to be honest . 
  i think that if i 'd ever visit , i 'd rather pretend i 'm a mute than try to speak french and be glared at . 
  hahaha . 
  but that 's because i barely know any french and my accent sucks . 
  the european version of mexico . 
  it all fits , since not only is everyone frowning @ our immigrants , but we also speak a romance language , like people in mexico . 
  also , bucharest is not budapest or vice versa . 
  and do n't call us slavs . 
  another way we can call romania is `` fantastic beasts and where to find them '' ( vampires because of bram stoker and dragons because of harry potter ) . 
  hahaha !, 
  french elections and dutch elections . 
  germany has good options anyway . 
  neither schultz nor merkel are anti eu . 
   i do n't belong there . 
  i imagined you on a spanish beach singing creep by radiohead . 
  all of them are interesting . 
  i do n't know much about luxembourg ( other than that juncker is from there and they 're a tax haven , supposedly ) or malta though . 
  i always assumed malta is a place where old rich people go when they retire , i do n't know why . 
  vertical flags best flags !, 
  seriously ? 
  in spain too ? 
  this is gold . 
  hahaha !, 
  i remember seeing him on tv here . 
  no one does depression better than lithuania . 
   close the window !!!!, 
  the curent will kill you !!, 
   but ... it 's 40c ...  do it !, 
  for those who do n't know :  austria , belgium , czechia , france , germany , hungary , israel , liechtenstein , lithuania , luxembourg , poland , portugal , romania and switzerland have such laws . 
  the netherlands has no law against genocide denial , but the courts have ruled that such a statement is a form of hate speech . 
  public drinking is banned here , but if you go in a park and make sure the park guard does n't see you , you can do it . 
  and it does happen . 
  so pretty !, 
  the eyes in contrast with the fur is beautiful . 
  - [ carpathian shepherd dog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpathian_shepherd_dog ) - [ mioritic shepherd dog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_mioritic_shepherd_dog ) - carpathian lynx is our national animal . 
  - while they 're not specifically romanian , we 're also pretty proud of our brown bear and wolf population . 
  oslo or stockholm or amsterdam for quality of life . 
  everything the nordics have because their countries are doing great . 
  their education is good , their politics are n't crazy , no corruption , the state helps their citizens and the citizens help the state , they 're happy people , they 're rich ( especially norway ) . 
  basically they know how to do things right and i think we should learn from them . 
  ana-maria is quite a popular name . 
  maria is in top 5 i think . 
  but young people nowadays are starting to use sophisticated names more and more . 
  a defensive eu army . 
  in varietate concordia . 
  but at least it costs you close to nothing . . oh wait, 
  yeah . 
  this dreadful fast internet .

  i am so sick of hearing it . 
  it 's just ... too fast . 
  dacians and romans . 
  oh my god !, 
  i can only imagine the weird looks from locals or other tourists . 
  i like the one for the kingdom of slavonia . 
  that blue is aesthetically pleasing . 
  *** sees city of pula *** *** snorts *** sorry , i am 2 years old apparently . 
  `` pula '' is a vulgar word for `` penis '' here . 
  means `` dick '' basically . 
  but yeah , their nordic flag is nice . 
  speaking of , this is how romania 's flag would look with [ the nordic cross ] ( http://imgur.com/a/1mafj ) . 
  there are 3 versions . 
  the last one is my favorite of the three . 
  thanks . 
  it 's made out of cannon captured from the ottomans in our war of independence . 
  and hey , your parliament already looks like a palace so you have that going on for you . 
  amazing building !, 
  to be fair , your flag is great and it does represent a lot of things , not just for france . 
  you could do that . 
  although our [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg/671px-coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg.png ) does n't appear on our flag , we did put the steel crown back on it . 
  i did not know this . 
  so everyone else was doing it wrong before `` modern times '' ? 
  haha . 
  everyone had seals . 
  some still do . 
  it is a nice flag indeed . 
  the colors work together . 
  yes , gypsies .
