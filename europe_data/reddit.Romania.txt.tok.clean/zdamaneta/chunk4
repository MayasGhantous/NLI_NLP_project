  where can i see them all ? 
  there 's no friendship there , more like hate between the two , especially since last years . 
  romanians = gypsies during soviet times ? 
  i really doubt that . 
  this shit became a stereotype after the gypsy expansion in 2000 's . 
  lithuania probably picked this from western media and poland since we had no contact whatsoever with lithuania , neither gypsies nor romanians . 
  lol , who made this map ? 
  i bet most malaysians do n't even know where or what is romania, 
  soon canada also ... haha, 
  well , by calling us gypsies is an insult , therefore you dislike/hate us ... 
  so they call themselves man/men , including their women ... :d, 
  i do n't think rom/roma means anything in gypsy language , according to wikipedia it 's dom and lom which comes from the word doma in sanskrit meaning `` a man of low caste , living by singing and music '' ... 
  if we romanians are criminals , then why do people call us gypsies ? 
  lol, 
  the term gypsy is used just as an insult in many cases , they use the term intentionally , especially the russians and hungarians ... the others most of them are just ignorant i suppose ... 
  but how would a country even function only with gypsies ? 
  lol, 
  russians hating us and calling us names is normal , the sentiments are reciprocal , but it 's weird when people with whom we had no history or contact hate and insult us ... 
  even the czechs who have plenty of their own gypsies , hate us and call us gypsies ... lol,

  [ oh noes ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/d2lchjtg5tscg/giphy.gif ), 
  well , you have the right to your opinion , regardless of how wrong it is , so let me ask you , are you a gypsy or one of those libtards ? 
  citizenship does n't mean shit , stop with your pc bullshit , they barely speak romanian and they are alien to our culture , the truth is they do n't give a shit about their host countries . 
   nigerians , moroccans , romanians more than half of the crimes are done by gypsies , therefore romanians do n't deserve to be tarnished and dragged in that top, 
  you nailed it, 
  true , they are all bilingual and many speak english or french as well, 
  romani ? 
  romanians do the same , not just the moldovans ... 
   middle east would be definitely better place without religion . 
  same goes for eastern europe . 
   i 'm nonbeliever great , same here , imagine the whole world being atheist , now that would be a `` heaven '' . 
  christian turk ? 
  i 'm not talking about this article particulary , even so paris and london above those eastern european cities ? 
  hahaha , give me a break !, 
   i 'm against censorship of course you are . 
  i think they should stop their propaganda , it 's going on for more than 3 years now , they brainwashed the brits more than enough , they can stop now ... 
  those cities i previously mentioned do n't belong in that retarded top , made by british media . 
  you disagree ? 
  absolutely . 
  bucharest , zagreb , riga , budapest , sofia and belgrade are safer than the western european cities where at any moment you could get crushed by a truck , shot in a cinema or blown to pieces in a bus or metro station ... 
  and as usual they had to include romania and bulgaria in their article ... 
  yeah , i definitely learned my lesson ... 
  sandals and socks ? 
  it was great but i could n't enjoy it as much as i would 've want since i burned myself like a grilled chicken , lol . 
  loved the view from mt. 
  in romania no , but i had the pleasure to enjoy -40 in quebec , montreal , amazing experience as well ... haha how about you ? 
  what were your lowest and highest temperature experiences ? 
  i remember it was over 40 , that 's what the public thermometer from that small town karystos showed ... 
  i went to greece few years ago and had the horrible experience of almost +50 degrees , got second degree burns on my arms and neck ... 
  since then i try to avoid the sun ... haha . 
  if i would have to choose between very low temperatures and very high , i 'd go with the first . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kinxvwoq9u ), 
  or they will blame the eastern europeans as usual, 
  you guys have christmas markets in turkey ? 
   the sun, 
  he 's not polish , right ? 
  do you guys still sterilize gypsies in sweden ? 
  last time was in the 70 's right ? 
   thick black winter socks . 
  racist !, 
  i would n't give a shit to be honest . 
  they ca n't be hungarian and romanian , they would n't hold eachother like that and one of them would be stabbed already . 
  wow , some great headline material for the british news , it 's gon na be huge . 
  gypsies do n't count , they do n't act properly therefore they search for it , everybody treats gypsies the same in europe , some europeans even used to sterilize them not so long before , but what did those poor bulgarians and turks do to deserve that disgusting racist attack ? 
  amen to that !, 
  i think we should sterilize them like you guys did in the 70 's but if we try that , your country would be the first to jump on our heads about human rights . 
  swedish people are hypocrites . 
  the troll with the swedish flag was actually a bulgarian, 
  the apricity forum, 
  our favorite portuguese [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-ktakcyke8 ), 
  i bet it 's the hungarian apricity squad ... 
  nothing to ruin about the image you have about us , it 's already ruined , i suppose by the british media , you guys love dailymail , sun , express , etc from what i heard . 
  * bulgarian, 
  this guy is bulgarian apparently ... lol, 
  that they fear death the most, 
  had no idea about that one , also some beautiful buildings were bombed and destroyed during ww2 i think , such a bad luck for bucharest ... : /, 
  once upon a time ... before ceausescu and the earthquake of '77, 
  chances of getting killed by a terrorist in romania are lower than getting killed by a shark in the black sea . 
  an aunt of mine has a russian blue as well , 16 years old , still fine , no problems , i think this breed tends to live long . 
  i do n't see it , looks more like a vampire ready to bite your neck off ... 
  cats  dogs !!, 
  actually those from hungary are much whiter than those from balkans who look straight dravidian . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6tatdn/would_you_feel_comfortable_if_your_child_was_in_a/ ), 
  nothing weird here , just scandinavians taking the liberalism to a whole new level ... hahahaha, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the british media never mentions the word roma or gypsy , only their nationality , that 's why we romanians have such a shit image there . 
   we have the romanian version , which is in time going to be shown in romania , no dubbing , just the original show . 
  that was always our intention was to make two shows , one that could still be shown in the original romanian and then one that could be dubbed here in english . 
  i wonder how long we 'll have to wait for the original version ... 
  i 'm undecided about watching it with the american dubs or the original version ... ca n't watch a movie or tv show twice . 
  hahaha , i love it !, 
  no wonder we are light green , the austrians are cutting our forests as we speak ... 
   i do n't really want to interact with western europeans in real life . 
  hahaha , i thought i 'm the only one who 's like this . 
  i 've never been to western europe and definitely not planning to , i 'd rather visit syria or iraq . 
  here , in canada i avoid them as much as i can . 
  for me , it 's the most mysterious country from europe . 
  you never hear anything about them , good or bad ... even the british newspapers ignore them , and they trash everyone . 
  ah , i was curious how a disemboweled shephard looks like ...
