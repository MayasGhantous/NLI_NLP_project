  ... but we do n't look to the uk for advice . 
  he probably means the us . 
  but they do n't pay interest on loans they give to other countries . 
  given their bad track record , what makes you think they are right this time ? 
  [ confessions of an economic hit man ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=4dznwh93byec&amp;lpg=pp1&amp;dq=confessions%20of%20an%20economic%20hit%20man&amp;pg=pp1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ), 
  yes , i was agreeing with you . 
  everybody used to say the libdems did nothing ... 
  it 's a report of ongoing events in english . 
  sure there 's a ton of reports in romanian , but we 're nearly the only ones who can read them . 
  it 's easy to believe that they knew it . 
  i guess this serves to show that ideology should n't trump consequences . 
  i can give you a few examples . 
  [ constantin br\u00e2ncu\u0219i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantin_br%c3%a2ncu%c8%99i ) pioneered modern sculpture . 
  [ tristan tzara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tristan_tzara ) and [ marcel iancu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcel_janco ) created dadaism , the precursor to surrealism . 
  [ george emil palade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_emil_palade ) created the field of molecular biology and made some of its most important discoveries . 
  interesting that he quotes cioran , a romanian writer ( who fled to france after the war ) . 
  i wonder if ` those ' to whom dsk is alluding in the passage are the eastern members of the eu . 
   then there are those who are too long-sighted . 
  these are capable of seeing beyond their own frontiers , but have chosen not to support the community that is nevertheless closest to them . 
  they turn to others , further west , to which they are willing to succumb . 
  this is what was on cioran 's mind and the echo of his impotent rage reminds us once more : `` how can we count on the awakening of europe , '' he laments , `` or on its anger ? 
  its fate and even its revolts are settled elsewhere . '', 
   you are romanian and your country has been allied with germany before and you are spanish and your country has been one of germany 's earliest fascist allies . 
  trust me , i can be a much better jerk than you if i want to . 
  the stuff with vampires sucks , but it 's a western product . 
  we do n't believe in vampires and never did . 
  i wonder what makes you think that i approve of the looting of antiquities . 
  i certainly do n't . 
  also , i 'm not german ( it 's a good idea to check people 's flairs ) . 
  but germany did make tremendous contributions to music , science , philosophy , mathematics , and literature . 
  on a per capita basis , probably the greatest contributions to the first four of these areas of all modern countries . 
  edit : it is preposterous to insult me with such grandstanding phrases as ` have you no sense of the patrimony of mankind ? ', 
  i assure you i have far more sense and knowledge of it than you can imagine . 
  yes , it is very true , but what i wonder is whether it 's very relevant today . 
  i mean look at iraq . 
  people in the country invented the wheel . 
  they also invented alphabetic writing . 
  and they built the world 's oldest cities . 
  this was all five thousand years ago . 
  how much does it tell us about contemporary iraq ? 
  not very much . 
  it 's a very different country . 
  i 'm aware of many people 's positions , but it would still take a careful discussion to persuade me . 
   a country whose rich history and culture are in many ways the cornerstone of western life , polity , and philosophy but that was 2,500 years ago . 
  it 's also possible that he was persuaded by isarescu to change his mind . 
  getting an education is not like watching tv . 
  sometimes you need to make an effort , adapt , learn new things . 
  if you want intellectual comfort then do n't go to college , just watch tv . 
  it 's pretty well-known that wealth is n't proportional to how much you work . 
  well , it 's fair to say we do n't know for sure why he did it . 
  he did consult with bnr though ( that 's the central bank and they 're very competent ) . 
  some of the difference is also supposed to come from improved tax collection , but i think we should wait for at least a year or two to how well it actually works . 
  the anaf campaign against tax evasion has been very effective so far , but sometimes problems have a way of adapting and coming back . 
  i know what you 're saying , i just do n't know why you 're saying it to me . 
  there 's a very good argument why wages should be ( much ) higher in romania , but that 's not because of hours worked . 
  it 's because we have one of the lowest ratios of wages to gdp . 
   i suppose that it 's a matter between the student body and the faculty then . 
  if only , but the students have the administration on their side . 
  ordinary sex scenes could trigger ptsd in principle . 
  in fact , * anything * could trigger ptsd . 
  but this is not about ptsd , it 's about people who * must be protected * . 
  i agree with you . 
  i never said wages should n't be the priority . 
  it 's just that even with higher wages , you ca n't retain competent doctors unless you give them proper instruments to work with . 
  money is n't everything to a doctor , it 's also about what you can actually do on the job . 
  it 's not just one isolated student who does n't want to do the assignment . 
  it 's entire groups who take a class and then petition the university to stop teaching greek mythology because it has sex scenes . 
  that 's oecd data from 2013 , but the study i linked to is eurofound data from 2014 . 
  one of the graphs in your links says ' 2014 , ' but it does n't give a source and anyway it may have been reported in 2014 but gathered for 2013 . 
  but what is your point ? 
  yes they do n't have the best tools , and yes the organization can be lacking , but the chart shows hours worked , not profits generated . 
  besides i doubt you 're in any position to compare greek and romanian workers and tell which of them `` work '' or not . 
  ( i do n't know enough to make that comparison either . ), 
  snowflakerism comes from the same root as the sjw movement , namely the narcissistic self-esteem brainwashing that has been practised for the last few decades . 
  at least they 're out of politics . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-17/here-s-what-membership-in-the-euro-did-for-greece#media-4 a hundred people on reddit told me the euro was * really baaad * for greek exports . 
  turns out they benefited a ton . 
  most people with ` trigger ' problems do n't have ptsd in the first place , they 're just sjws who found a way to feel powerful . 
  yes , and to fix the hospitals and buy new equipment . 
  he 's not even allowed to be a party member by the law . 
  maybe he does n't tell them how to vote . 
  or maybe he had n't made up his mind so he let them do as they wanted . 
  current unemployment rate is 7.1 % in romania and 6.9 % in the netherlands . 
  there are people in the countryside in romania who do n't have jobs but are n't counted as unemployed either . 
  that 's because they work agriculture on their fields . 
  there are also people in the netherlands who do n't have jobs but are n't counted as unemployed because they are n't looking for jobs . 
  all in all nobody knows how to tell how many hours are worked per capita in a country . 
  but we do know how to tell how many hours are demanded from a full-time employee according to their contract , and that 's what this statistic does . 
  not in the study we 're talking about . 
  the most annual hours are in hungary , poland , and romania , with 1,840 hours each . 
  greece has 1,800 hours , which is a full week less . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/comparative-information/developments-in-collectively-agreed-working-time-2014 ) ( scroll down to table 1 ), 
  if anything , there are probably more people in the netherlands who work part-time than in romania . 
  so yes , the significance of this statistic is only partial - as with every statistic - but that 's no reason to pretend that it 's ` wrong . ', 
  the methodology is provided in the source , to which i linked in a comment . 
  it 's not a repost . 
  my previous link was to a second-hand source , and i removed it to replace it with the original source . 
  nothing is perfect . 
  you can look at productivity , but productivity depends on the public infrastructure , on the natural resources , on your access to markets , and on other things too . 
  what 's that got to do with the report being bullshit , which is what you have claimed ?
