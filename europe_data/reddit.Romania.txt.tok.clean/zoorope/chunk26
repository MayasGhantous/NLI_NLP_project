  this means that * part * of the gdp growth comes from improved absorption of european funds . 
  but even so , i do n't see why think it 's totally unimpressive . 
  eu funds are n't easy to absorb after all . 
  again , what the eu is giving you does n't reflect directly in gdp growth , because they 've been giving you money in previous years too . 
  look at it this way : romania gives * lots * of money to vaslui county , but how is there gdp growing compared to other counties ? 
   romania gets exactly 2.8 % of gdp from europe , coincidence ? 
  coincidence , indeed , because those 2.8 % are n't up from 0 % . 
   also , it has a projected inflation of 1.6 % gdp growth is determined against a single currency at a single point in time , so the inflation does n't matter . 
  while at the same time supporting feminism ( and probably lying about it too ) . 
  btw what 's with all this ` fury ' headlines ? 
  is it a tabloid thing ? 
  i 'm assuming you want your hqs out of danger . 
  not sure though , but it makes sense . 
  of course if they 're * too * out of danger then it might impair their judgment . 
  the romanian government claims the actual growth will be substantively faster , but we should take that with a grain of salt . 
  nobody = purcelusul, 
  it 's only useless if you do n't plan to be a father in romania . 
  it is relevant to human rights in europe . 
  the complainant lost virtually all contact to his child for three years ( not to mention loss of time and money ) because the courts could n't be bothered to make a timely decision . 
   it took the romanian courts more than a year to decide the mother had brought the child to romania legally . 
  two more years later , in the fall of 2011 , a romanian court finally granted the mother child custody , and visitation rights to the father . 
  ferrari had only been in contact with his child three times since 2009 . 
  even now he only has visitation rights . 
  actually i agree that this is n't a very interesting post . 
  on the other hand , as / u/flocosix pointed out , i do n't think every post in / r/europe must be international . 
  so i looked at this map and i said that does n't seem to be right for romania , where the largest export is fairly well-known to be cars and car parts . 
  i went to the [ source ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2049.html ) they indicate , and indeed , the map is wrong . 
  the first export category given for romania is ` machinery and equipment . ', 
  ( i assume cars are considered transportation equipment . ), 
  i did n't copy from / r/oldschoolcool . 
  i got it on / r/romania , which is from where it also went to / r/oldschoolcool . 
  btw i do n't understand what you mean by ` decency ' in this context . 
  links are n't the intellectual property of the subreddit where they were first posted . 
  i 'm totally republican , but i decided to be monarchist for a day . 
  what a difference 73 years made . 
  leo who ? 
  edit : i see , you mean leo di caprio . 
  he 's still alive by the way : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_i_of_romania, 
  what kind of roads do they need ? 
  i remember that a couple of years ago bucharest was the eu capital with the highest concentration of luxury cars per capita . 
  there are people there who have money and do n't know how to spend it . 
  well that could be the outcome , could n't it ? 
  maybe it 's time to ask for an eu hungary debate instead ... 
  i do n't think we buy almost anything from russia anyway . 
  but maybe you 're talking about russian-owned malls . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  the british are n't boycotting russian money , and they could afford to . 
  of course the british were never the standard of decency , but then again , were we ever ? 
  those are aromanians though . 
  the bulgarian vlachs i am talking about were daco-romanians , the same as us . 
  from what i know the reasons why they do n't want it have to do with legalities ( they can claim more elsewhere if they do n't claim it ) . 
   keep in mind that they are n't even second in line . 
  if at any time we were to abandon our claim ( not likely to happen ) , south maudlandia becomes the new owner . 
  dunno what to say . 
   in fact , many of the nobility and rulers of bulgaria at that point were vlachs . 
  from what i understand those were vlachs from south of the danube . 
  they do n't exist any more : either they moved north or they became bulgarian . 
  wuve ? 
  complex social problems can have more than one root . 
  published [ here ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=458389&amp;fileid=s0021932005027069 ) , but the submission link is to a free copy . 
  yes , but how much are the taxes for the minimum wage ? 
  currently it 's about 220 $ , so yeah . 
  yes , but 62 % of rural households do n't have audi q7s . 
  no , broomsticks are west german . 
  wikipedia says `` in 2014 , 40 % of the duster units sold worldwide were badged dacia and 60 % were sold under the renault marque . '', 
  edit : i see what you meant , though . 
  interestingly , the markets where they call them renault are actually outside of europe , which confirms what i was saying . 
  yes , i 'm aware of that . 
  they also kept dacia in france btw . 
  in fact , they currently have 5-6 % of the french market . 
   i think dacia has been presenting itself as `` french '' i 'm not sure they have , though . 
  pretty much everyone in europe with an interest in cars would know that dacias are romanian . 
  dacias are designed for the most part in romania , but also in some respects in france . 
  they are usually manufactured in romania , but some are manufactured in other places , esp . 
  also some dacias are branded on certain markets as nissans , ladas , or renaults . 
  also `` the other militarized version of the duster is a 2-door pickup . 
  it was first publicly revealed in 2014 . 
  its 2-door body was developed by romturingia company in cooperation with renault . 
  this vehicle is fitted with mast-mounted reconnaissance sensors . 
  this reconnaissance vehicle can be used for observation and surveillance in day/night and all weather conditions . '', 
  actually nowadays i heard some of them claiming to be classified as `` western europe '' . 
  to be fair , russia still has history cleaning to do . 
  but you 're right , pointing at other people is n't going to serve as an excuse for yourself . 
   a few decades ago even speaking hungarian was discriminated . 
  a few decades ago we had the same hungarian schools , and hungarians freely spoke hungarian all the time . 
  the only thing that might have been different is the shops , because those were all government owned . 
  * nigel forage . 
  i thought she was a part of at least one of berlusconi 's governing coalitions , so she does have some influence , or at least had , did n't she ? 
  a road from poland to galati only makes sense if it goes through what is nowadays ukraine . 
  true , but that 's not my argument . 
  she 's a fascist . 
  yes , i was aware of the nietzsche connection , and you 're probably right . 
  but i wanted to keep the discussion focussed on sarmatianism proper , not on what became his interpretation . 
  i think the key question is this : did sarmatianists contend that sarmatians had master rights over regular poles ? 
  ( or e.g. 
  over ukrainians ? ), 
  without fascism ? 
  i beg to disagree . 
  italy still has influential fascist politicians today , including mep alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of benito .
