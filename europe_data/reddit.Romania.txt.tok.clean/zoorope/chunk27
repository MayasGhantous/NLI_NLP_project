  a small minority among gypsies are from romania : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people, 
  i think we 've had some exchanges before . 
   he also heavily criticized armenians you always come up with red herrings . 
  so what if he * also * criticized armenians ? 
  that 's not why he was murdered . 
  what is consumer confidence ? 
  armenians wo n't feel so insulted any more . 
  i do n't know what that would prove . 
  we were talking about how long it lasted , not about who did it worse . 
  instead of lmao you could google . 
  the last slaveholder in europe was turkey . 
  also bondage is tsarist russia was pretty clearly a form of slavery . 
  it 's simply the kind of thing that journalists are taught in schools these days . 
  but which one of those did i use ? 
  anyway 11 % is not negligible . 
  did n't his party win the most recent european elections in the uk ? 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  seconded . 
  i lived in buildings like that for decades . 
  they are n't meant for human beings . 
  you mean his oppressive , totalitarian architecture was n't enough to spoil it for you ? 
  you ca n't deny his guilt just because he also made nice buildings . 
  he is the ideological father of the urban oppression of hundreds of millions of people . 
  classical tactics : use segments of the working class against each other , make sure the wages stay low and the profits high . 
  the english working class have no one left to look after their interests ( clearly not the ukip if it wants their wages to stay low ) . 
  so they 're understandably pissed , and for some reason they picked on romanians as a scapegoat . 
  it 's a movie . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  it 's ppp-adjusted . 
  i assume the imf also has views about how the prices will evolve . 
  it 's funny that i had just edited my comment to say that . 
  fun fact : romania has a larger population than all of the other top 7 growers combined . 
  edit : and i * think * poland has a larger population than the other top 8 combined . 
  actually you 're expected to grow a bit faster than the netherlands , see my table in this thread .

  source ? 
   i ca n't tell if he 's super gay or super straight . 
  he 's super crooked . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  / u/andreiion is talking about the legal obligation of host countries to receive the refugees . 
  that legal obligation is determined by their status as war refugees . 
  they have that status when they flee from syria to turkey , but they no longer have it when they leave turkey . 
  it is entirely possible to work in turkey or in romania . 
  now as for ` good ' living , your status as a war refugee does not entitle you to a high wage . 
  turkey also has peace , so why do they need to leave there ? 
  it seems there 's like four downvotes . 
  well yes there are plenty of puritans even today , but the people in the sixties who went to the moon , not so much . 
  actually slovenia has a higher ihdi than france : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi i hope you reflect on that . 
  jfk was no puritan . 
  you do n't seem to disagree with my point . 
  if you are right that immigrants invest less effort into raising their children , then that might explain why they tend to have more children , right ? 
  western societies , including europe , treat parents as if they were their children 's servants . 
  children have ` needs ' and ` rights , ' parents only have obligations . 
  small wonder most people do n't want to have children any more . 
  also , the best way to have children is to get married , but marriage is also a bad deal these days . 
   there is a psychologist names erik erikson who called this generitivity there is a psychoanalyst who made up some psychobabble . 
  nothing unusual , and does n't serve as an argument . 
  sales tax = vat, 
  greece has 300 . 
  but can they can things done ? 
  then you cry persecution . 
  on tumblr . 
  ca n't afford . 
  51 % can speak some english , but that does n't mean their english is good enough to read the legislation . 
   are there ever individuals or groups who manage to uplift themselves from squalor ? 
  yes . 
  but they are ostracized by the other gypsies , so they ca n't influence the rest of the community . 
  they just end up assimilating completely into the host culture . 
  no , i did n't want to ban anybody . 
  that was actually the point . 
  malnourishment does n't need to make you seriously underweight . 
  we used to eat significantly less calories than we needed . 
  of course our bodies usually adapted and ` slowed down ' , so we did n't get morbidly thin . 
  ( i guess this also made us more docile , to a point . ), 
  it was the same in general , but romania in the 80s was particularly bad . 
  yes , and that is what they are in fact . 
  they did n't actually starve to death , but they were malnourished and it took forever to get any food . 
  interesting !, 
   always are you sure ? 
  i mean who said it was obese ? 
  and who said it was obese ? 
  we are talking about plus-sized models , not obese . 
  i did n't say it was obese . 
  in what way ? 
  plus-sized models are a cultural influence , that 's all i said . 
   banning oversized models would n't make any sense as those do n't exist in that line of business . 
  actually , they do : https://www.google.com/search?q=plus-sized%20models, 
  apparently yes : https://www.google.com/search?q=plus-sized%20models, 
  what good can be served by an self-selected internet user survey on this topic ? 
  awesome . 
  actually it 's pretty good except now and then when he does the ultra-pacifist thing . 
   everybody else but ourselves . 
  i have to disagree there . 
  maybe you hang out with different people . 
  of course * some * romanians will never blame themselves . 
  also some romanians will never blame ceausescu , but what does that prove ? 
  is it false or is it imprecise ? 
  no , i 'm not arguing about anybody 's grades . 
  i 'm arguing about who is actually * a good student * , and that thing is n't always reflected accurately by the grades .
