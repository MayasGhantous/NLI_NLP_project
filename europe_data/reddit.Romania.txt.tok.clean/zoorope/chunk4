   our discussion is over haha now you 're stealing my words . 
  well , some of us care and some of us do n't . 
  what is the point of arguing with me just because you do n't care ? 
  you 'd be surprised how many people would think you 're gypsy based on your flag . 
  he never asked anything about ` genetics ' , you 're doing your usual thing again and reading what you want to read instead of what people write . 
  as for the thread , if you do n't like it , then simply go away and stop flooding it with your contrarian ranting . 
  actually , they are misinformed , in certain ways . 
  for instance a lot of people believe that gypsies originated from romania , and they are shocked to hear they came from the indian subcontinent . 
  i do n't know how everyone is identified , but it is quite possible to learn to do it . 
  obviously there will be different cues for different people - gestures , makeup , accent , clothing style , the way they walk , the way they smile , how much they smile , how much they frown , etc. 
  edit : also , turkish people in general do n't look as sunburnt as you think . 
  see google : http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=turkish+women http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=turkish+men, 
  our low quality conversation is now over . 
   the average romanian from romania has the typical eastern or north balkan face and where do you think half the people of turkey originate from ? 
  ( hint : not from central asia . ), 
  edit : some of the people in those images have middle eastern eyes that you do n't usually find in romania . 
  but most of the rest could very easily pass for romanian . 
  well , maybe that 's because you think all romanians look russian like you ... 
  clearly you do n't know what half the turkish people look like . 
  here : http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=turkish+men http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=turkish+women, 
  for instance , many romanians look `` turkish '' . 
   it 's even written in the article that the roma community is disturbed by those events no , that is n't written in the article . 
  if it is , then point me to the quote . 
  that is possible , but my point is , you can learn to tell people 's ethnicities by watching them and by hearing their accents . 
  the cues are subtle and mysterious , but they are there . 
  it 's easy to bet when i 've no way to make you pay ... 
  speaking of fools , you should have paid attention and read the parent 's comment . 
  notice that he says :  especially the ones who are not part of any visually identifiable minority, 
  it 's easy , fluent english or not , you have an accent , so they simply ask ` where are you from ? ', 
  plus no matter how ` white ' you are , you probably do n't look irish or scots-irish . 
   racist slogans including `` romanians out '' were daubed on a wall note that it 's not  ` romanians ' out they may be confused or not , and that may be right or wrong , but it 's clear what the slogan says . 
  we 've made a lot of progress against corruption , bulgaria not so much . 
  maybe that 's part of the explanation . 
  germany and the soviet union started the world war on the same day when they invaded poland together . 
  these are reactors number 3 and 4 . 
  there were plans for a second power plant with two ( ? ), 
  more reactors , i do n't know what the status is on them . 
  my point is that if our gas needs have gone down , then the decrease in local consumption has been higher than any hypothetical increase in exports . 
  so your theory about sending the same old gas to germany wo n't add up . 
  i doubt that , except maybe some ` hardcore nationalists ' like you . 
  do n't feed him . 
  so how are we supposed to export that gas to germany if the news is that our gas needs have lowered ? 
  coffee takes 10 minutes to reach your brain , although it does take 30 for maximum effects . 
  as for placebo effect , that phrase refers to several things that are very different . 
   we have that evil eye thing too and i think it 's real haha no tell me you do n't ... 
  that 's easy . 
    it 's poverty , third-world poverty . 
   well , it 's not . 
  i can see form your posts you have an attitude towards people who work hard . 
  / u/trolls _ brigade is trolling hard . 
   second , more recently the policy errors of the french government with regard to tax , which have driven talented people abroad and demoralised both businesses and individuals at home . 
  in good tory fashion , by ` talented ' they mean rich . 
  see my exchange with / u/xaguta here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/26zo5q/he_and_other_romanians_say_they_are_made_to_feel/chwjyjn, 
  that 's a tough job because there 's a lot of cultural background . 
  but here we go : / u/pokymonn is of the view that romanians are not discriminated against in the uk , unless they are gypsies . 
  so he thinks that if british people act like dicks toward you , that means you 're gypsy . 
  now it is possible that pokymonn is racist toward gypsies , and it is also possible that he is n't . 
  i did n't say either of those . 
  what i said was that , contrary to his guess , i am not gypsy . 
  perhaps because pokymonn has a better-sounding answer , which is that he 's from moldova . 
  no i did n't . 
  you misunderstood . 
   you ca n't be racist towards europeans , while you yourself are an european yes , you can . 
  hitler was racist toward many other europeans . 
  some americans are racist toward other americans , and some asians toward other asians , etc. 
  naked-viking , / u/pokymonn is romanian/moldovan . 
  i , too , am romanian . 
  this makes us members of what sociologists call an in-group . 
  when members of an in-group communicate , certain things are self-understood and implied automatically . 
  when you do n't belong to that in-group , you wo n't understand those things . 
  this goes double in the context of pokymonn 's previous comment in that thread . 
  putting things together it 's quite obvious to any other romanian that my interpretation of his words was very plausible . 
  to you , of course , that is not obvious . 
  who 's accused of racism ? 
   there is no reason for anyone to go looking into your past there may not be a * reason * , but one of the first three questions anybody ever asks is ` where are you from ? ', 
  they did not ` escape , ' they just left . 
  what do you mean `` something wrong '' ? 
  you probably think i 'm gypsy and i 'm stealing purses in britain . 
  that is quite ridiculous , and you 're wasting my time . 
  uhm , what ? 
  i was n't sarcastic at all . 
  i was honestly thinking you should blog the story . 
  that 's a great story . 
  maybe you should blog , as it 's kind of wasted in a comment here . 
  sure they wo n't know you 're romanian by your looks , but as soon as they find out , a lot of them will change their approach toward you . 
  fta :  wherever you go and they hear you 're romanian , they change the music . 
  that has happened to me with british people i met in * america * , which is nowhere close to their country . 
  if the problem is blue banana logistics , then why do n't we develop our own logistics instead of begging for wealth redistribution ? 
  of course it would be reasonable to apply for eu funding in order to develop said logistics , but that is already possible . 
   eu killed all our industry i disagree . 
  our industrial production has clearly increased more than decreased over the past ten years : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/romania/industrial-production  they made it so expensive for average ppl that they cant afford i do n't agree with that either . 
  romania has the cheapest natural gas in the entire eu . 
  the real reduction did n't come because people could n't afford it . 
  it came because the government stopped giving subsidies to energy-hungry companies , and because a ton of buildings were thermally re-insulated . 
   how long and how hard have you been trying ? 
  ten years , twenty ? 
  how about seventy ? 
   every culture is conceptually the same what does that mean ? 
  yeah i thought of that rally . 
  then again , it could also be the mafia doing its usual business and using the opportunity .
